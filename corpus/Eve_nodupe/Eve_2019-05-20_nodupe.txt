explain what boson is to someone who won the game?

The less opposition (and structures) there is, the less it takes to burn a region tho.
---
At some point we will bump into someone who wants to keep their home and have a fight.
---
That or someone poking the south hits something that actually matters, in a way it needs to be taken care of.

---
Randoms caught with their pants down in Delve while ignoring the move op don't really count towards the war, do they?
---
They aren't attacking or defending, they're just ISK-obsessed pilots using the Goon banner for safety, despite it being made clear that the move op is #1 -- no super umbrella back home.

awesome video dude, what software did you use to record im guessing part of it was used with OBS but i cant figure out how you record more then two screens for it, and what editing software do you use im trying to make my own videos but im kinda lost on how to do it, so any tips and tricks and advice you can give me id greatly appericate.

Omg a 2k and a 3.6k alliance can't match a 34k alliance + pets in sheer titan and capital numbers.Holy shit that is a suprise, please suck your own dick more
---
I offered my perspective and you offer insults
---
Same boat. Who knew “2 days remaining” meant just one more login bonus
---
Serious question, how do you bag a JF?  I've always wanted to whore on one.  
---
And HTF does a titan die on a keepstar?
---
In regards to how I do multiple clients at once, I have my sources in OBS set up like[ this](https://i.imgur.com/DSIMhxi.png) they are set to capture specific game windows, when I go on fleets I decide which window will be which and change accordingly[ like so](https://i.imgur.com/22bhlHz.png) (Once logged in each client will show as exefile.exe: char name)
---
A few more weeks of this and the super and titan prices might finally start to recover.

If you think staying up till 4am to play a video game is normal or acceptable please get some help.

I wouldn't have bothered logging in my alt every day if I knew the counter was misleading like this. QUITE lame

isnt querns the guy who just hauls fuel blocks around all day?
---
If I only read Reddit for the last 48 hours I'd think that you all were the ones that went to war rather than ran from it.
---
The pillow talk bookending is pretty cool I wish more videos had that.
---
Hey now, don't sell Pandemic Horde so short. If you yanked their leash, I'm sure you could count on as many as 200 ECM bursting T1 frigates to aid you.
---
It's posts like this that brings me back to the special place called r/eve.
---
You boys just moved too slow.
---
eve classic when
---
must be your first war. reddit is the front lines.
---
So your admitting that you did run from goons? Ty.
---
Nope, just an F1 monkey. I ain't special.
---
Remember that time Goons were cowards because they wouldn't welp their supers into a massive blob of these guys evaccing and the rest of Eve? That was what, three maybe four years ago?
---
This is some next level damage control. Imagine bragging about killing structures while panfam essentially burn everyone in delve to the ground lmao
---
My only goal for this war is to not lose a single one of my ships to Goons in the North.
---
So your admitting that you did run from goons? Just very fast I guess?
---
There is a responsibility of the attacker to seize opportunity. Better luck next time.
---
the dread footage was from the same fight correct? how where you able to get both the dread footage and the two other subcaps at the same time was the third one setup using shadowplay?
---
Missed the point like a good goon you are.Not too suprised
---
Goons deploying north. Panfam deploying to reddit.
---
Holy shit that sound amazing.
---
Losing a JF requires making a truly monumental mistake as it's almost impossible to lose one if flown and moved correctly.
---
Pretty much any JF that ever dies was due to the pilot either on a rush job and cutting corners, or simply so dense they don't realize how they can accomplish the same task (or reach the same end goal) without dying.
---
Source: Flown JFs for about 2 years, watched enemies, randos, even corpmates former and current lose them for the dumbest of reasons.
---
I guess you could tell that it is hahaha.. 
---
People dropping killmails and BRs on reddit like they’re dreads and supers..
---
I have a 3rd source which is on top of those 2 called "Escalation" in case of dread/carrier/super usage mid fight. It's a bit of a cluster to sort it out in a hurry but it works.
---
I just toggle visibility (the eye icon) as and when needed (after selecting the client as described above), since sources visibility depend on their order in the list, when toggled it fully overlaps.
---
It's not ideal to be honest. But it's workable.
---
You're being disingenuous, so I'm not really obliged to take you at face value. When you talk about raw numbers and discount the greater majority of your coalition, you're being disingenuous.
---
hero bumping and moonwalking
---
&gt; INIT in particular are very good at what they do.
---
let me rephrase that: pando and maybe dark shines in particular are very good at what they do. The regular init member is hardly superior to a goon linemember really.
---
zero is a number i suppose
---
If by "everyone in delve" you mean our worthless krabs who didn't deploy please destroy then have at it, if PL wants an actual fight maybe they can come to 6RCQ and get one.
---
I don’t think this is whining but more so me making a joke.
---
I dunno defend their home maybe?
---
extracting takes 5.5m SP at minimum you know that dont you?
---
I'm going to need a mountain of popcorn and and ocean of butter to go with the salt coming out of this thread.
---
It should be reimbursed by CCP already, since it was drawn off the undock by someone impersonating a goon, which is against the EULA.
---
The offender has had their name reset and is now Amarr Citizen blah blah.
---
I'll be honest.  I've actually lost two.
---
One was due to D/C'ing upon undocking in a system (Faspera) I really really should have avoided.
---
The other was due to jumping to a fleet cyno and encountering a standings problem with the locals.
---
I dont think the titans jumped back, they simply undocked for free kills.
---
hue hue hue
---
yes, thats regex for 3 alphabetical characters, if look very closely it just matches everything that contains az3, because everything else is ignored ...
---
If I only listened to Goon/Pet propaganda my brain would be so smooth you could use it for a shaving mirror like the rest of you.
---
Like youre aware how that this belief you have that the Northern Alliances somehow don't mine and or build internally is completely false right? They're just significantly smaller, a fact you seem to like to enjoy forgetting
---
I'm glad you are still enjoying this!
---
Basically, NCPL bitched out of an actual fight, and now they're picking the low hanging, retarded fruit in delve to try and damage control the situation. It looks really bad when the mere suggestion of a conflict is enough to get you to unanchor fucking everything.
---
So they’re unanchoring their structures?
---
If this is the best PL/NC have I can't wait for Naz to start his propaganda war.
---
One side has absolute titan supremacy and outnumbers the other side by ~1400 active combat chars going by zkill numbers. That's not including if Legacy decides to "third party". The other side has already started safing assets. 
---
Buckle up for one of the most boring wars yet. Literally going to be one side chest beating about how many whales they killed while the other side chest beats about grinding down uncontested structure timers.
---
nice work, i love how the egg can be replaced with a capsule
---
You sure are asshurt though. If the whole thing is no big deal to you, why are you so salty? It's almost like the whole unanchoring thing was the last nail in the NCPL coffin. You're literally the laughingstock of eve. Will there be another Providence invasion after goons finish mopping you up?
---
Sure we want the titans, we could do with the people flying them knowing how to preas the stop ship button though
---
Who is actually going to fight goons though?
---
Lmao at this spin. I hope somebody archives all this north damage control
---
Ello bebe
---
I hope they do
---
Honestly that hardly changes anything. Thats what 2.5months of omega training. So you roll a new extractor alt or cloaky alt cuz god knows we need more of those.
---
Dont you know cloaky alts solve the botting menace!
---
I honestly hope this is a troll post, unfortunately it seems that it isnt..
---
Never trust nobody on the internet and this is why I don’t give out personal details. Because if I was in your situation and they fucked me over like that, I’d end up in jail and they’d end up in the hospital, a fair trade.
---
It's an attempt to save face. I can't imagine how embarrassing it is to have your leadership bitch out as hard as they did. I don't know if I'd be bragging about dunking on the bottom of the barrel retards in delve though; it's hardly an accomplishment. They'd have died to bomber's bar or whatever random roam fleet encountered them first anyway.
---
Man, I hope Legacy forms on PanFam's side.
---
It's not gonna happen, not in a million years, but I wish it would. It would make everything suddenly a hell of a lot more interesting.
---
Oh man. That sucks. D/Cs are basically the only reason you should ever lose a JF, most other things are easily verified before you jump.
---
I personally own/control every midpoint I use (that isnt an npc station) and if there's even a chance of an issue, I plan an alternate route.
---
Sometimes my corpmates have been frustrated with me for taking extra days to move my JF. I'm just glad it moves at all, I'm extremely cautious/paranoid about its use.
---
It would probably kill a few who weren't properly anchored, but the guy was gating a Titan to a system within jump range with no umbrella and no fax support, it wasn't like he would have lived very long regardless
---
Like ncpl literally "didn't want that region anyway" l m a o keep the tears coming my man
---
If they nerfed the rorquel and made it more of a command ship like the Orca I think this would be a great addition.
---
Ah, I get it now. You're salty cause ASCEE denied you.
---
The greater majority? Even if we count horde fully (which is stupid since there are so many alts , spies and newbies) the numbers don't add up. And I'm being disingenuous?
---
Imagine bragging about how hard you ran away from a fight
---
Inb4 the Triglavian invasions is completely badass and starts third partying on everything then splits whole regions apart. Make Eve great again!
---
Incoming “Never gonna happen”
---
Sometimes it’s good to have hope.
---
I could never down doot you John
---
agreed.   as much as i want a fighting war.  i get the feeling this is accurate.....
---
Man you are assblasted. Even when the reality of who actually harbors bots comes out, you don't care. Who cares about facts right? Grr goons!!
---
&gt;It should be reimbursed by CCP already
---
Big if true.
---
Oh, so for your side we can ignore a bunch of your numbers, but for our side we can't? You can sod right off with that trash. Pandemic Horde are yours. They belong to you -- every last one of them.
---
Ehhhh
---
Thats a fact though
---
Its super rough when you realize your first unit was the exception not this dumpter fire of leadship you just got passed
---
mate you sound salty af  
---
sand in the vagina? you clearly sound like it
---
I honestly didn't even consider changing the egg to a capsule. Darn. That would have been a cool idea.
---
Yeah, ooh, we're down a whole 12 hours of production in Delve. Terrifying, how will we ever recover?
---
No, because nobody wants to get blobbed by goons and the only winning play is to not fight them.
---
Turns out nobody wants to fight a blob, good job.
---
That's what I'm hearing but I can't confirm that - however it would follow since the kill was the result of a EULA violation.
---
Have you been under a rock?
---
Nice kill and all, but can you do us all a favor next time and upload a video instead of a slideshow? Thanks!
---
We need to rally and CCPlease!
---
Considering Naz hasn’t posted anything in four days I’m not sure what you mean by under a rock.
---
Oh man four days is SO LONG, can’t wait for him to start after he’s started
---
i thought it was originally
---
Considering the number of low effort “delve is burning posts” in the last 24 hours four days is a long time.
---
Wat? He afk boated off the undock.
---
Nice vid man! Good editing!
---
&gt;the last 24 hours
---
they've posted at least a half dozen since noon for fuck sake.
---
Sounds like a you problem
---
welp that's news to me - i'd been told he was drawn off the undock by a hostile fleet invite (not having hostiles blocked was a rookie move)
---
I'll have you know I put as much effort into this as the "Sonic the Hedgehog" animators have into their new movie.
---
You seem upset.
---
no he lyf bumped while coasting afk. you were misinformed.
---
I just find it funny the last time this much reddit shit talking was done by panfam on reddit was the day after they gave up and watched 4 keeps get burned down on their porch. They skipped all the steps of grief and went directly to reddit.
---
I'm not ncpl LMAO
---
Poor planning by GSF not to deploy a backup umbrella.
---
Test doesn't seem that busy, maybe they could slip across and be your "home duties" squad?
---
It requires the pilot to manually aim it.
---
There's a lot of room for complete fuckup.
---
reddit posts don't show up in red on your kill board, that's why.
---
Horrifying
---
I think your only problem Asher is the lack of UStz to fight at a squad level. Your sigs/squads are bigger than most alliances in EVE. Not the PI alts that drive up alliance headcount but pure # of skilled players. And the fact that these timers get shared with the rest of the Imperium or other large sigs on some occasions, basically outright forces the defenders to respond with more friends in case the possibility of the main fleet showing up. 
---
If you wanted a square peg that no one changes tz’s and must have set number of players then what you are looking for is an instanced EVE arena.
---
Ooo, scary goons on the way! Whatever will we do?
---
Goons will move big fleet to Tribute to shoot some abandoned structures. 
---
NCPL will move small fast fleets to Delve to kill the krabbers.
---
Then what?
---
Dont worry man i actually respect the hell out of you. Im was just throwin shit at the wall too. I bet you absolutely love the state of delve right now. It is really something to behold. Never seen it like that.  So many groups 100+ fleets. Amazing!
---
Goons,"We are so strong because we defend our stuff and industry is the key to victory"  
---
Also goons," We are PvPers, we don't care about indy only guys that stayed behind"
---
Neat thanks for info ill fool around with it see what happens. Cant wait for next one you make.
---
So you’ve basically gone from BOB to being trailing Olmeca in damage caused to Goonswarm.
---
That’s fantastic.
---
How is being a spy against the EULA?
---
What does it means?  
---
I didnt get it
---
yeah I know, I’m just excited to see the start of the decline of goons in delve :)
---
Based off that guys post history, he’s been in the military, worked at a casino, had a rare blood disease as a kid, is a chef with a wild eve story, works an office job with “racist black people who openly celebrated ‘South African Genocide of White People”, and would walk home every day along some train tracks with a group of kids he never got to know but would jump in front of trains for a rush.
---
This story is fake as shit.
---
Nope. Just a slightly modified "Alien" movie poster.
---
This is a trully great Titan Dunk.
---
&lt;3
---
You know the jammers only rely on certain ihubs right? So the important ihubs (KS and their neighbouring systems) were always scheduled to be defended, and always formed for by everyone. Those ihubs included DW-, P-33, DO6. Those decisions and fleets were made by the allied leadership. CO2 would form for literally everything, even irrelevant stuff that allied leadership had said to ignore. That's fine, no one is saying they shouldn't form and fight but to pretend that those fights were meaningful to the outcome of the war and thus no one else helped is bordering on delusional. I notice you don't point the finger at NC. or PL who didn't form for most of those either.
---
I know the narrative is important to you, but narrative =/= facts.
---
How is it spin? You nerds are taking weeks to deploy not really sure what you are going to expect to happen when you finally get set up.
---
Failing to see what you even described as an exploit
---
Oh, and he doesn’t “remember” the in-game name of the person he sold his life belongings to move across the country to visit, or any details beyond the fact that he was feeding officer-fit Kronoses in 2013, was abducted as a kid while visiting his Japanese friend named “Yoshi”, and even has told this EVE story on reddit before except with the details changed... Very believable!
---
Did you not read who they were spying on?
---
Never gonna happen, but it would be amazing if it was an actual *threat* instead of just being another flavour of incursion. Though the art we have of deactivated gates looks very promising...
---
True statement.
---
Goon derangement syndrome
---
Wow, you seem very tough.
---
From the EULA:
---
&gt;No player may use the character name of another player to impersonate or falsely represent his or her identity.
---
The name this character had previously was very similar to Apple Pear's to the point where CCP saw fit to rename the character.  Since this is the case, the event generating the petition can be considered reimbursable.  That being said, my understanding is the hull would be reimbursed but not the mods.
---
I would actually love to know the number of non-goons pve alt in delve dying during those war
---
fair nuff.  i wasn't there so I can only go on second-hand info.
---
So the game is broken?
---
I don't want to build things, just sell researched BPOs or BPCs.
---
They are saying any they lose during GOT don’t count
---
at least they deploy?
---
Goon members have never been very good at evaluating or reading social interactions, so I will won't fault you for projecting your desire that I'm salty about your Tribute plans. I'm not even PanFam.
---
And he claims hes a chef while clearly he has to be a plumber
---
REEEEEEEEEEEE
---
savage
---
I sell Titans. Posts like this please me.
---
Oh yeah you’re right, that’s something only goons do
---
We told them while the war is up there will be no umbrella and you will not be saved
---
&gt;I don't know if I'd be bragging about dunking on the bottom of the barrel retards in delve though
---
 Almost as much of a challenge as, say, bashing uncontested citadels?  
---
The elite fighting force that is goons WHEW
---
PANFAM hurfing over a handful of supercap kills?  How the mighty have fallen.
---
&gt;our power 
---
  
---
Dunno - sure post like you think you have anything to do with it
---
Who said I did?
---
&gt; The first insertion was INIT, not Goons as a whole. From the reports I've heard, they were told "form bombers" and weren't told where they were going or what they were doing until they arrived in Rage. So... no. The proposed change would not have had the effect you describe here, in this case. In a hypothetical scenario where opsec is held less closely, it could give less hardcore players the ability to participate in more wormhole fights. This definitely something that should be considered. I'm not certain it's a bad thing.
---
They were not told but there FC would have planned differently, there FC's or well the people that set up the op where very much aware of wormhole mechanics and would run this differently if they where allowed to dead clone over, the likelihood would have seeded more bombers and tell people to move their dead clones over there for the weekend, with a larger insertion, also goons was out in the hole on the first fleet, let's kill the init did this by themselves story right here.
---
As for allowing less hardcore players access, fuck no wormhole space is this good because of the hard commitments you have to make it keeps the player count relatively low as this eviction and many others showed mass isn't as much a limiter for attackers, the real limit is how many people you can find that want to give up their weekends to do this, evictions have to be a pain in the ass to run, if you make them to simple for the attacker they become common this means wormhole life becomes next to impossible, unless you follow the PI star plan. 
---
Now I get a feeling where you don't live in wormhole space because honestly the opsec in wormhole corps is like way less common then in nullsec corps like often the target is known by the line members way before the infill, with a msg not post it on Reddit, like most of the time it's literally in the ping or it's slightly opsec and known while burning, like it's exceptionally rare for people not to known where they're going long before there in the hole. 
---
&gt;Yes. I'm ignoring this because it's irrelevant to appropriate game design. Speaking as a wormholer who would love to be able to defend my home, we should HTFU and do what's good for gameplay even if it gets us evicted.
---
I'm all for doing what good for game design but this isn't good this is gonna lead to a quick dead off small entities as the reality is a big group can just dump a citadel down put a siege doctrine in it setup clones go home and jump back to bash the shit. 
---
One of the biggest defense of small entities is that right now if I want to evict some random C3 entity it means I need to get guys to commit for a full weekend often longer unless I particularly hate the guy's the effort is often not worth the trivial amount of loot that will drop. 
---
If it becomes a question of content citadel then fight, like I would dump citadels all over the place, like a new target every weekend, like either batphone somebody and it's a fight or they don't and we get a loot drop, whereas right now I ask for a hard commit, something that is a lot harder to get done on the fly. 
---
So now as a small entity, you really need to get a big entity to help on your defense and this leads to an asymmetric relationship commonly known as pets. 
---
&gt;So if the attackers have brought in sufficient material at the beginning for overwhelming the defenders and all their resources, then the attackers do not need to hold hole control to bring in any more material. I agree. However, they may wish to still maintain hole control to prevent defenders from evacuating assets, or to prevent defenders from calling external reinforcements. In this situation, I'd break down attacker options into roughly (a) exhausting full hole control effort, (b) "just enough" hole control effort designed to minimize defenders hauling material in and out, (c) no hole control and count on being able to overwhelm the defenders and their allies. If I'm reading your complaint right, you're concerned that attackers will be able to do b/c instead of just a and this will make it easier for people to do evictions. Why is this a problem?
---
Easier evictions are a problem because the best defense for somebody that isn't basically part of the big groups is well the fact that it's a massive pain the ass to evict your hole so unless you particular standout as a dick most people consider it not worth the effort the moment the effort goes down well the barrier for deleting smaller corps because you can goes down, it's not the big entities that really have to worry here as well deleting them would still be a massive pain, it's the small entities. 
---
This is a long term health problem as a lot of those small groups grow into bigger groups that well end up fighting if the entry is harder it means fewer groups make the jump into wormhole space, now the balance for evicting right now as well about right in that it can be done but it's a massive struggle ( even known with the null lead evictions we see it's not as hard as it should be given they can solve the logistic problems with pilot numbers ).
---
&gt;Wait, what? You don't have spares of your home defense doctrine(s)?
---
you have a couple of spares everyone does the issue I was getting at is that the attackers after multiple fights are more likely to hold a higher spare count as the defenders ( this has to do with the simple reality that your home defense caps rarely get used outside of home defense so you tend to limit how many you have compared to the attackers how are in ships that instantly get used or get used at a known date ), this makes the incentive among the defenders most lower for having a high number of spares and the cost well feel higher, so human nature tells me a majority will be out of home defense ships after the 2/3 welp anyway, whereas the attackers logistics are likely centralized so they likely have more than 3 welps of spares. (especially when the meta includes dead clones as now you know there are gonna be multiple fights). 
---
Like the majority of spares I have for handout tbh, as well it's likely to be a 1 shot deal like once press that triage button or siege button it's likely your either come out winning or you get podded. 
---
&gt; Spoken like someone who's never tried to hold hole control over a k-space static.
---
I have and I will explain this: so when you have a k-space static it's a pain in the ass to control, but if you want to do it right you have to pay attention to there scanning so once they get a scout out that hole needs to be rolled in 1 shot ( yes if you have that 1 C3 type it's a massive pain ), you need to have the rollers ready to once shot the next hole again now your biggest issue is if they land a scanner before you do honestly there is a degree of when in doubt roll again, you have to avoid the scenario at all cost where the hole isn't well about to be rolled and they have knowledge of the location, with a k-space static this becomes more of a pain. 
---
like your control becomes no different if you're controlling against combat ships or ceptors like if they get to jump there fleet in your fucked either way.
---
Love that Moderat track too. Nice video.

This reminds me of the Fountain War where someone from Kugu did something similar; can't remember if it was Doink or Jeffraider, but it was pretty juicy. I think it might have gotten deleted or taken down though which is unfortunate :(

Not sure why you think PL/NC would even take that fight knowing they had no chance. You need to think more rational and stop being so tribal.

Nope - just men who show up, and bitches that run and hide...

I’m just sitting here waiting, you here yet? Taking so long

All I gotta do is wait
---
If you ever get here, you still on the road?
---
Well duh, you never face an enemy toe to toe when you don't have the ability to do so. Instead you hit them where they are weak. Are you not taught this is any place you reside in?
---
I'm nowhere.  And everywhere.
---
So silly
---
"Alts Online" 
---
This statement couldn't define eve more if it was released by CCP.
---
Didn't say anything about being fun or not.  It's just sad to see how far they've fallen.  What used to be a normal occurrence and not that big of a deal, is now something to be hurfed about.
---
remindme! 2 weeks
---
hahaha "home region burns."
---
How many stations have you killed so far?  Or even reffed?
---
He just doesn’t understand, it’s hard for some
---
More than you
---
Naw, it's easy to understand.  You kill a few ratters and act like you won the game.  Woot.
---
Still don’t get it I suppose
---
Just culling the stupid
---
Where is the explanation in the devblog?
---
No, I get it.  I totally get it.  You have to claim victory wherever you can,. no matter how miniscule, knowing that the war was lost for you before it even began.  The last great act of defiance or some such.
---
And that would be how man, exactly?  Waiting on a number...
---
Nah
---
Pretty much
---
I guess you’ll wait a rather long wait, kinda like me waiting for your move op to get where it’s going. Tick tock
---
I lost one to a dc, and a Pl director In a faction super. It was gay
---
&gt;" encountering a standings problem with the locals"
---
That sounds problematic.
---
Ok.  you tipped your hand.  You have got to be a goon trolling.  Well played goon sir.  I thought you were serious for a minute there.  You had me until the "home region burns" part.  If killing a couple of supercaps is your definition of a region burning, then you have my pity.
---
Look at you with the 2d chess
---
Torps, not bombers. Like ye olde Firewall. But still.
---
Imagine not wanting to risk your Super fleet against one that can more than double yours in size
---
What a mystery
---
"not killing us fast enough", someone already used that.  Please move onto "didn't want that region anyway"
---
Top kek
---
I've been away.  Krabs?
---
Pretty sure I haven’t said those words. Maybe that’s was another conversation you’ve had. Or maybe it’s made up, idk i just work here.
---
I'll have a look! Thanks :)
---
How much cleanup did you have on the models? Also what settings did you use during the prints?
---
yea microsoft has some shares
---
At least they don't drop Corp right before losing it
---
Small wins are even big now. lol.
---
You want all the numbers goonie? Let's have **all** the numbers then
---
Panfam                         The Imperium
---
PL 2,337                        Goonswarm 34,005
---
NC. 3,699                       Initative 5,187
---
PH 16,715                      Bastion 3,211
---
                                         LAWN 1,405
---
Total : 22,715                 43,808
---
lol.  Ok sparky.
---
See ya on the battlefield.  If you bother undocking this time
---
You're welcome, friend.
---
You here yet?
---
Wouldn't it be be only like 80 bill in fuel since it was locally grown?
---
I'm guessing microsoft is the name of one of the corporations in the game? Can you give me a link where I can go look at its stock price.
---
Pretty much.
---
You undocked yet?
---
See, was that so hard? Like, seriously, trying to pull some "we're only NCdot and PL, have mercy querns-sama" shit.
---
Yeah man I’ll just sit on the undock and wait
---
Give the fireside a read if you don't believe me, it came from the horses (cat's?) mouth.
---
Yes, corp shares are already a mechanic. You can click a button and pay out money per share. You can take a vote for corp matters, and more shares mean more votes. If you have enough shares, you can kick the CEO out of their position.
---
Lots of stuff that shares can do... But I don't know of any corps who use them. It's kind of a forgotten mechanic.
---
Each Corp has shares. Usually one person, the person who started the Corp has them all. You could divide them up and use them to vote in another CEO if said CEO doesn't play for whatever reason. That is all they are used for
---
Or option 3, We are so strong because we defend our industry but if our folks choose to disregard our warnings during wartime then they deserve what they get.
---
I peed a little in my pants
---
Shares allow someone to coup a corp. That's why no one uses it as intended.
---
Your sentence implies it very strongly
---
Are you seriously this stupid? You were bragging about power we can't even approach, with a coalition twice the size of ours
---
this is eve.
---
Arguably that makes it infinitely better? It's not a gauranteed AoE deathexplosion for everything not triple tanked.
---
I use eve fairly often, almost every day. I've not had to reinstall it.
---
To be clear, I mean in *two and a half years* - as in, since I started playing eve.
---
Something is wrong with your machines.
---
The majority of people who play this game are not having anything like the issues you describe.
---
How do I know?
---
/r/eve would be on **FIRE** otherwise.
---
Find out what is the same in both machines, and make a detailed list.
---
It could be some bit of hardware, maybe even a peripheral like a joystick that has a misbehaving driver, or software like a 3rd party antivirus/firewall.
---
One by one, go through that list and do without whatever that thing is temporarily - maybe a day, maybe a week, however long it takes before eve corrupts again, or you're sure it's not going to.
---
Oh, and I shouldn't need to say this, but make sure you have all windows updates installed.
---
It's not a 30k ehp DDD like the old days. It's conal? So arguably cooler XP
---
we need more shitty eve propaganda.
---
I think it's hilarious but since I'm goon people accuse me of trying to spin. 
---
Krabbing while the alliance is deployed and dying is poetic justice.
---
Sounds like telling the girl that 'it's a good size' but we all know it's not big enough.
---
I've lost 2. One was over 6 years ago for doing something monumentally stupid - using a POS as a midpoint.
---
Other one was very recent by getting distracted on an undock when my cat had a seizure.
---
ps. Cat was fine, but has developed Heart Failure and might not be long for this world
---
pps. 2nd JF cost far less to replace than the vet bills, as is to be expected...
---
how about you stop shitting out false informations if you dont know what actually happened?
---
Weren’t you guys posting so much about non combat assets being moved a few days ago?
---
Zkillboard's URLs are pretty flexible. You'll notice that clicking the button to look up solo kills just tacks "/kills/solo" onto the end. So...
---
Search for the ship you want, so you can get the type ID. You'll get "/ship/12345/" or whatever. Then just tack on the rest so you have "/ship/12345/kills/solo/" and press Enter. Taa daa! All the solo kills with that ship in chronological order. =)
---
my smugboner from x47 is still up help
---
Meh, it was nothing personal, we just took a whaling fleet through a bunch of wormholes yesterday. Also dropped on Frat rorqs a little after we caught the Goon super and rorqs.
---
remember that time ncdot blued up every other alliance to attempt to evict test
---
I'm sorry to hear about your cat. IRL can definitely count as a 'disconnect' from Eve.
---
4 days*
---
Not everyone is a basement dweller like yourself
---
I don't think you understand what reddit is. Dude, enjoy the game, have fun and seriously, stop being so tribal. The spod is getting to your brain. No on won eve by killing a few ratters, who said that? Lastly, why are you so butt hurt that everyone went to delve to go whale, did you lose a super because you were ratting?
---
Was going to link exactly what this guy did
---
Naw, brah. 家, not 俺様. Learn the difference -- it could save your life.
---
She's my mother in laws cat.  She's old, and has had a good life and we're making hr last days as comfortable as possible.
---
The last cat I lost lived until 21 and would curl  up under my monitor gently for pats as I played eve.  
---
They really are furkids...
---
And the best news he hasn't quit either, just posted a bounty on SLYCE for 100mil
---
just like in 2018 when Delve numbers were down by 10 trillion per month, and yet still out-earned every other nullsec region?
---
&gt;when Legion of xXDEATHXx move op was caught everyone temp-blued
---
Horde actually defended xXDeathXx in C-L
---
i'd probably quit
---
Absolutely salty. Hate these stupid log in events nvm the rest of the shit CCP is doing to EVE. Honestly this is just the tip of the iceberg lol.
---
Between the second largest mistake ccp has ever made imho being Rorqual rebalance, Sp farms.. Extrating cloaky campers being essentially free. Like this shit is cancer for Eve.. But hey they bump "player numbers" right? Who cares if its just one turbo crab with 300 toons its more players right!.. No its fucking not. They need to do something  about the proliferation of alts. Nvm capitals.
---
It's almost like recruitment and retention is part of power. If NCdot and PL had actually put any energy into playing the game, they could have easily out-recruited us and retained more people, especially with the social momentum they had after 2016. Heck, they already had the lower caste set up in the form of phorde, so they wouldn't have to cheese off all of the bittervets who only stick around due to having a particular ticker. (You can see that STILL lingering, in 2019, with your weird refusal to count phorde as being part of your own.)
---
XD It does sound like an daunting task.
---
I'm not saying they're right, only that I understand..
---
Do you care if someone loses a titan in your alliance..?
---
The issue isn't marketing so much as player retention. EVE doesn't really have an issue getting new players in, it has an issue keeping them playing past the tutorial. What we really need to do is a few things in tandem:
---
1) Increase the amount of base SP provided to new characters
---
2) Increase training speed for the first month of a new player's life, say a 2x training speed bonus for 30 days
---
3) Improve highsec and faction warfare (there are tons of solutions for this created by people with more experience than I have, so I'll defer to them)
---
These changes can make the game a lot friendlier to newer players and get them into the game faster while allowing them time to develop the patience necessary to thrive in EVE. Right now for a new player it can be pretty disheartening to see that you have a week or more "before you can fly anything good" and this can cause a lot of people to quit the game before ever getting into it.
---
It is not.
---
This coming from a CODEie.
---
Most objects exhibit diffuse reflection, with light being reflected in all directions. All objects obey the law of reflection on a microscopic level, but if the irregularities on the surface of an object are larger than the wavelength of light, which is usually the case, the light reflects off in all directions.
---
For objects with surfaces so smooth that any hills or valleys on the surface are smaller than the wavelength of light, the law of reflection applies on a large scale. All the light travelling in one direction and reflecting from the mirror is reflected in one direction; reflection from such objects is known as specular reflection.
---
So I guess that means they are gonna panic evac to Saranen then faff around in interceptors for the next couple months?
---
i don't see PL doing that either
---
balls
---
Those numbers were much worse last time we deployed... wonder how that ended.
---
Vonhole gets them by volleying them with a supercarrier while they are "aligning to warp" away from a station.
---
Explanation: clicking "warp to.." disables your invulnerability timer. If your ship isnt aligned (i.e to an insta undock) it will spend time aligning to your target. During this align time you are not only shootable, but you **cannot issue other commands** without first "stopping" your ship to cancel the warp command - this is how he gets them, when they are stuck "in warp". 
---
The counter is to align before warping, since you can easily just dock that way.
---
Isn't every shipbuilder's job list already full with the Eagles that TEST is buying?
---
Not with perfect skills and virtues
---
Please don't ever think that someones flair truly represents who they are. You can get baited pretty good with that logic, I know from experience.
---
The only difference, at all, is if you need to scan 0.25au, which isn't often.
---
Did you guys and us poach are their forum warriors or something? It's embarrassing for them.
---
Naz posting is so medicore why do you guys cling to it so much..
---
Because why would a CEO willingly give up the power.
---
A rolling cap caught usually means they're retarded and didn't fit a 10kmn, or don't own fighters
---
Latest update hes now put a 100m bounty on the alliance lmfao plus 100k bounty on every member in sgu
---
&gt;  Everything wealthy is already evacuated
---
I know you guys moved a heap of titans and supers out of the war zone but there is still plenty of stuff here in delve for us to kill.
---
Do more pvp tournaments for twitch entertainment
---
Same thing I was going to say. Quit before being laid off.
---
Just sell 49% of the shares.
---
Oh the actual battles suck. The fun is the lead up, the propaganda, the teamwork, the relentless structure timers that don’t get escalated to supercap cancer, the messing around on comms waiting for grid to load, it makes it bearable. Plus it’s easier living in null because I’m a casual.
---
Is there a market for them? How do players buy/sell these shares?
---
four T2 istabs, one T2 low friction rig, EM-703 implant
---
If you use obs make sure you have optimized settings
---
Well i only got 5 in astrometrics, 4 in the others and virtues. It's just easier to scan with core probes most of the time and swap to combats when you need/want them.
---
I'm not sure that other people outside of EVE watch the tournaments. A few might, but they are actually really boring to watch if you have no idea what they're doing. Perhaps that's more of a retention thing?
---
Noone really buys shares in Eve.
---
Corporations are in some way run like actual corps though.
---
How many wars has Reddit actually caused over all these years? After the memes, flair bait and :CCP: trying to pile drive their own game we are all still here El Minering and 1488'ing away billions of isk wether it's self destructed rigs or buses on the undock.
---
Another one of these posts
---
*rolls eyes*
---
Agreed. the first thing I would work on is my resume. If some of the features were actually working well or close to well you might have something to work with. If Faction Warfare worked or exploration was more interesting that would be something. Perhaps if just piloting your ship was more interactive with the game environment that might help (or not). There are lots of things in EVE but few for new people to just check out and/or do.
---
If you don't want to deal with the consequences of associating with a particular corp, don't associate with that corp. There's a reason nobody brags about being part of Marmite.
---
Black Legion.
---
Lul.
---
5 levels of gal dessie, 5 levels of blaster spec, 5 levels of surgical strike
---
lots of room to work with.
---
I would love to take on this challenge myself, do a few dozen wormholes a day and track everything down in a spreadsheet, probably make a single easy to recognize bookmark in each system that is unique just for quick reference. I do think it would get really bad at near the end though, would be a lot of RNG hoping for a unique system after a point.
---
That's Pornmaker, and previously Tiky Mikk, who volley JFs on stations like Ignoitton and Aurohunen. Vonhole is the guy who ganks blops/AT ships by using clean astero toons and similar bait, then dropping regular carriers.
---
EVE in general is boring mechanically there's nothing exciting about watching eve at all unless they basically remake the game
---
Wow - rude.
---
&gt; PANFAM hurfing over a handful of supercap kills?
---
You must be new here.
---
I was trying to relay that sentiment as diplomatically as I could.  =)
---
Is from code 
---
Signs “random piece of shit”
---
Yup I agree.
---
Run out of ships?  In Delve?  Surely you jest.
---
&gt; War literally hasn't even started yet
---
Looks like it started, just not when or where you wanted.
---
We really shouldn't have to be making addons to fix a broken site. The site just shouldn't be broken.
---
Nope, you can easily check this as they are not on the undock
---
Lmayo what a concept, I wonder if they know
---
Don't stop believin'   
---
Hold on to the feelin'
---
Then how do shares get distributed if not bought/sold?
---
Thats because when i do use ^ it turns into super^script and i haven't figured out to avoid that.
---
This is a sad hill not worth dieing on.
---
The irony is that this was made for Nulli secunda while they were being evicted in Delve by TEST, Goons and PL working together....
---
By pretty much any measure other than raw kills, PL is far more active than Goons or TAPI. In the last 7 days, % of active members :
---
Goons : 9.9%
---
TAPI : 10.5%
---
PL : 16.1%
---
Goons have 14.5 times as many members as PL, but have only 3.6 times more kills in the same time frame. We are a very active PVP alliance and are consistently ranked in the top 10 active alliances on ZKill. 
---
Meme all you want about not understanding the meta, or being a dead shadow of our former selves, but to say we aren't an active PVP alliance is patently untrue.
---
Broke tether and nano lif helped :)
---
Oh hey, seen myself there. Nice. Awesome video, easy to watch.
---
Ages ago, when corps were trying to raise funds so they could afford their first capital ship, or trying to get their industry business off the ground, they could have sold shares to get the money.
---
But now that everyone has their own fleet of capitals, money isn't a concern anymore. So nobody needs to scrape together funds.
---
You could ask Olmeca for advice, I suppose.
---
[removed]
---
flair baited.
---
Ha! First comment!!!
---
Yeah I think they should increase the base SP and give the racial / school choices mean something as far as where it gets allocated. At least give them 3 months of SP. or the equivalent of the Brave newbies 120 day plan W/ select t2 weapons. The alpha thing is just too long to get good and let players make the jump
---
you can create a corp for 1m isk. you start with 1000 shares. you can create unlimited shares.
---
i'll sell you a million shares in my alt corp for 2B isk.
---
Curious to see how well this ages.
---
"war will start next week" 
---
Haven't we heard that one before.
---
The only time it makes ANY difference is if you need to .25 au scan
---
I personally don't need to do that ever running combats, both on my spare scanner and main scanner, both in max-scan tengus. Only one of them has virtues
---
The famed TAPI victim complex now has Reddit covered. Lol
---
Ooh, I miss those. I remember entire fleets being wiped out by \[friendly\] titan \[misfire\] XD
---
Fuck even try to use something like Geforce experience to record
---
You could try out the new abyssal deadspace sites. You get a filament, open the portal, then you've got twenty minutes to finish...or you die. Lesser time commitment, a bit more dynamic pve, it scales up well to however hard you want it to be (5 levels of site), and it offers pvp in the higher ones if you want to give that a try.
---
WTB A riverini smug post..
---
No one uses shares that way.
---
If the shares get distributed, then you might see a co CEO type situations will have split shares for a corp 50/50.
---
Shares are more about power to do certain in-game tasks. You used to use a vote tied to shares for certain security options for assets. The most common shareholder vote is CEO replacement.
---
The big problem is that the CEO vote can be initiated by anyone with shares. If other shareholders miss the boat on when the vote happens, then a hostile take over happens.
---
There have been some cases of corps using shares as a concept as intended. But they didn't use the in-game system. Instead everything was tracked in Google docs.
---
Thank you forgetting rid of the fuckwits
---
NGDS made my day =\]
---
Docking your citadels is some next level shit
---
It's win-win for everyone, thanks for giving us this content
---
Flair checks out.
---
Panfam have always been cutting edge innovators.
---
There was an awesome diplomacy (we were still in Imperium back then) discussion on TS just before we jumped in.
---
"What if Goons come in to help Test?"
---
"We won't shoot Goons then."
---
"Perfect. Let's go"
---
If you only spent all that energy actually defending your space lol
---
Fuck home duties, useless people who don't know what a STOG is deserve to die.
---
Well, the difference in numbers already dropped by a factor of three just by doing that, so he may have had a point.
---
&gt; glue-sniffing mouth-breathing keyboard-mashing hotpocket-deepthroating fucking nerds.
---
Fitting name for a Goon. 
---
&gt; Hurr durr made you jump. You lost soooo much money because of it. Durr we killed gewn ships doing dumb in delve too. Winning the iskie war bois 
---
This is Goni-Goon Art of War 101.
---
Arbitrary? Not really.
---
On quiet roads you expect to see less car crashes than busy roads... Because less cars.
---
Same shit here, but spaceships not cars.
---
Yeah that sounds really poorly implemented. A better system would be any shareholder can initiate a vote, but the policy proposal must receive 51% of the shares' approval. For players who don't play everyday, they can just enable auto-vote based on how another player votes. This way even with not all players online, a policy proposal can still get 51% approval.
---
Not anymore CCP hit insurance payouts with a nerfbat.
---
As i know few days ago was dark theme and some new things in BRs.
---
Ganking miners in 0.5 space. T1 catalysts cost 1.5mill a pop. Fun times, great practice for scouting and getting warp ins, and great when there is no activity in your WH chain. Train your alpha catalyst pilot today!
---
If you're counting fuel. You should count the 100's of billions in structure rigs that got pulled aswel.
---
I meant after the insurance payout nerfs...  
---
Thought you goons were wealthy.
---
They don't need better marketing, they have admitted they get up to 10,000 new players every month, they just happen to be shit at fixing broken things and finishing  abandoned content leading to a lot of the people not staying.
---
Remember when NC titans weren't even originally involved in ualx and were called in late when goon supers started coming?
---
Yup and I'm making a killing
---
North kills dumb goon Krabs while they are in a move op. 
---
I bet once they get to their destination things will change a little.
---
Yeah basically.
---
I mean... upvotes for the effot and everything but... why?
---
Enjoy low sec.
---
Killing people who didn’t deploy and were told there is no umbrella and they will die by their own side is news now?
---
Is the next stage posting high sec barge kills?
---
Not everyone wants to share comms and resources with retards who drool into their keyboards, shocker
---
Haven't played in ages but I had to post just to say that video is very well made.
---
The whole games like this
---
I'll take another look at it then.
---
So if regex aren't supported then why by typing this and hit Enter: [A-Za-z] in "Search New Eden", gets me 1 NPC-agent, 493 characters and 4 corps starting with "Aza"?
---
You are strongly misunderstanding how these mechanics are used and how the economy of the game actually functions.
---
Apologies, I meant strategic fleets or fights. Not a few hunting roams getting kills in Delve
---
practice sessions buff Sisi player counts!
---
300% fuel usage still isn’t that much ISK, especially for a large group
---
So don't? The separate caste was already set up.
---
Insurance on a suicide gank. :Thinking:
---
haha they are not even moved north in full force and already throwing shit into the fan...
---
I mean as a target of this war i have to say NC. wasnt on a single killmail down there (as far as i know) and the most hate about this automaticly goes back streight back to us :) 
---
And this tells you a lot about the amount of rage and madness they have. Actually they cant realy harm us except shooting astras and maybe some keepstars with 600 Titans :P; I hope Vince deploys use closer down there so we can join the fun for the clubbing.
---
&gt;and give the racial / school choices mean something as far as where it gets allocated
---
This isn't a good option IMO because it means new players have to pick somewhere to specialise. New players should be given a broad range of general skills rather than a narrower range of more specific skills.
---
I'll have the uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm....
---
what do you got against baboons :((
---
yea why do u think they lost
---
If only CCP didn't change game mechanics and this is literally impossible vs any fleet with a scout now.
---
It's not the content like FW that's the problem, though that is part of it. The bigger problem is that most people jump into the game, see that they need to train a week's worth of skills to fly anything, and just quit.
---
NPE is terrible, new players start with not enough SP and without a boost to the training queue making early training time more bearable, and the tutorial is just atrocious. EVE takes a fair bit of patience to play but you can't expect that immediately out of every new player. You have to ease them into it.
---
is the posting as bad as your fcing
---
In brief for everyone who hasn't heard it yet...
---
Grr NCDOT, but not really (really tho)
---
Renters Bot
---
We have supers
---
You will die in delve (shockingly accurate prediction from mittens)
---
We are great
---
Shout out to GSOL
---
Grr NCDOT (really this time)
---
hard to say who had worse odds at the time, that war that wasn't or this war that won't be.
---
Never Not Keep Posting
---
Because sandbox?
---
I got bored from ratting  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Shhhh. Don't ruin their narrative.
---
:(
---
Lost my only one trying to dock in a station that I'd been using for weeks. Surprise! Access permissions got changed. Lesson learned.
---
We'll see if its just a few I guess. Though that said, if anybody can break the prison that is Aegis sov its probably Goons, however if they carry this right, you'll end up having to make some odd choices soon because you're shackled to your sov under this system like never before.
---
It'll be nice to watch this ones mistakes and victories play out from an old folks home.
---
The difference is motivation.  Goons don't claim to be elite and their goal is to glass the region, contested or not.
---
im onto u, nerd
---
I feel like giving more SP to new players could be a problem, you know bots, ratting alts all over the place and I don’t think it would be good for the economy in the long run and everybody will whine about plex prices.
---
Obviously there probably is a solution, let’s say if they made active ratting more profitable, like belt ratting for example, new type of rats or something similar, just as an example and nerf vni ratting to the ground..
---
I’m a relatively new player myself, and everything was way too overwhelming for me when I started, since day 1 all I’ve wanted to do is pvp, and solo with low SP wasn’t that great at all so I ended up injecting but that’s another topic.. I tried the game back in 2013, I felt literally lost had no idea what to do or what I can do and quit within 2-3 days.
---
So if you are out of ideas you come up with posts like these.
---
When the Imperium announced the war and started moving I actually thought 100% NC. would run from their home and come to Delve, just to say that Goons "arent showing up for a fight". But Honestly? This is even dumber. Thanks man. Still havent expected too much. Better stay docked again during the war. After blowing all your own structures up because you were scared of a killmail, this will be better for all of us.
---
You don't have to, but don't complain about being outnumbered then.
---
You got bored from the most fun activity in the game, so you decided to do the second most fun activity in the game? I seeee
---
Don't u gays have phones.
---
Have you ever shot structures in eve? They die the same speed defended or not lol.
---
Don't worry in a few weeks you'll be a fuckin expert at shooting structures
---
Another term for "ratting" in supers or mining with Rorquals.
---
&lt;.&lt;.... Just got back, Someone explain it to me.
---
Obvious trap should be obvious.
---
right now, nobody cares if you scream in delve.
---
Panfam is burning delve, apparently.
---
And I'm sure that's important to somebody somewhere.  =)
---
So we are not counting the rigs on the dozens of citadels unanchored last week as part of this. Because I would be willing to bet that those are worth more than everything that died in delve over the past 48 hours.
---
 Underrated comment
---
&gt;I feel like giving more SP to new players could be a problem, you know bots
---
Every fix discussed these days gets shot down due to bots being able to exploit it, its time CCP took the issue seriously because a lot of things they can do to attract and keep new players would benefit botters much more.
---
\&gt;\_&gt;.... Nvm, I figured it out.
---
Have you ever successfully defended a structure?
---
O\_\_O Oh dear lord, I just checked. I was planning on heading there latter today, too, good thing I found out.   
---

The best way to avoid the hard part is to go in and go out from a WH, almost never failed with this method.
---
Just take the SP from Undocking V
---
You know how old your demographic is when they show you iconic pictures like that :-).
---
Remember kids, no wizard hats.
---
I'm not a moron I don't play this trash game anymore
---
Pretty much, but in reality bots are already exploiting game mechanics and they always will no matter what, pretty sure somebody could also script bots to run DED sites, explore, belt rat... Unless they start IP banning people for botting and somehow rig the client to see related accounts etc, I don’t see an actual solution, so they might as well try do something to keep the current/future players happy.
---
What level do you have undocking trained to? It’s a requirement to have that extracted and completely untrained.
---
The ccp math is dumb. At a 4au scan, it's the same. At an 8 au scan, it's the same. At a 0.5 au scan, it's the same. 
---
But because cores allow you go to to .25 it's shown as double strength. Bigly brained ccp
---
Yes, can confirm they didnt blow up.
---
can also confirm they didnt blow up
---
You clearly missed the memo, there’s no need for ops fcs to deploy. They only deploy when there’s opposition.
---
It's pretty much entirely up to chance.  
---
But then if you find a wormhole and leave through it, that's an easy way to launch yourself on an entirely new adventure!
---
paying 15% to get everything you own out of hock doesn't show up on a killboard \*taps head\*
---
Not to mention probably a bot farm or just care bears who thought they were untouchable lol
---
MER speaks for itself
---
every time goons deploy, the terminally spodbrained krabs left in delve feed hard until their handlers come back
---
Every move op is long. Every. Single. One.  
---
Or you could just yolo it, but people don't like that.
---
yeah okay fair point they arent cheap but as i learned from you alliance, if you build it yourself with mined minerals it didnt has any value so thats kind a unnecessary to list em.
---
shit... 5 hours left at 15/16 complete... why does it say May 2-20 if the 20th doesn't count? fuck
---
i cant find a single post from an NC. or PL member about how we are owning. So you maybe should stop being a glue-sniffing mouth-breathing keyboard-mashing hotpocket-deepthroating fucking nerd and think before typing.
---
and now you slowly start getting it. no one will form a fleet and jump into your Blop. So enjoy crying here about us not fighting as you prefer and the mean other partys using an advantage to blow up youre stuff.
---
Yeah you're better off going to Tribute.  Apparently they're unachoring everything there so lots of free and open systems.
---
don't name a spy Ạsher Еlɨas if you want kills from fake fleets to stick
---
that said, this wasn't one of those ones so it's gone forever, death to supercaps
---
Well neither did those faction titans you all docked up last time. Still lost.
---
I went straight into some FW to shake the dust off. Works a charm in forcing you to relearn stuff
---
Shhhht Grath..... dont make them start another hellwar ;)
---
No not really, they meta gamed the Goons there's fuck all to kill north...
---
Cringe.
---
oh i heared it in full strengh. The whole 20 minute Mittani speach. i also realise now what he thought when he had foreseen this situation. at min 10 to 15 dunno the exact timeline he stated that some guys will start attacking shit in delve. And this is an advantage for you till you can Kill shit in multiple locations.... So ofc it fires back when you lose kind a 400 bil in less then 2 days and kill basicly nothing of value.
---
I’ve never gotten an escalation to stain. The standard is less than 10 jumps from the system I farm them in, and with traveling, smartboming and running the site I make more ISK than traveling around scanning in an unbounded ship, in the site running ship that’s not optimal for travel, hoping for a good unrated site.
---
r/prisonwallet
---
Yeah was my bad, when we dropped on the second titan i was still processing the vid of the first titan drop and wasnt able to stop it. I also didnt expect us to drop on another titan that fast. Learned my lesson and will do the video after the fleet next time.
---
Yes, that's why they evaced their supers and titans, unanchored anything of value and deployed to delve.
---
&gt;Exciting search of the day
---
Sounds like Minmatar propaganda but ok
---
\*checks Twitter*

EVE is dying

Do not forget your old account can still be played, it will just be alpha.
---
If you are a high, low sec guy give triglaven content a try. 
---
If you are a null sec guy, the Goons vs Pamfam war just started. With a shade of luck there will be lots of content to be had.
---
wow epic
---
He has the spare time now that he isn't multiboxing a ton of orcas in highsec anymore.
---
Oh yes what a brilliant and well thought out plan! Now, the plebians like me do have the small, insignificant question of, how to actually do that without unnecessarily feeding expensive assets? Surely your limitless genius has come up with a way to beat the biggest power bloc in game, assisted by two other major blocs, with a newbie alliance and two more veteran, but extremely low member alliances? Please let us unworthy Northerners catch a glimpse of your near god-like planning skills.
---
If you do not post a super kill on reddit, did it even happen?
---
Until the CEO is away for a short spell and shareholders create votes to "Create more shares".
---
Me? mate im a wormholer. I have no stake in nullsex politics.
---
The true hero of the fight
---
I'm sure when mittens ran away in 2016 that was just superior tactical thinking
---
Then by your standards. Goons have lost nothing. All those ships were built in Delve. All of that fuel was produced in Delve.
---
fuel is expensive mkay?
---
why are you reposting?
---
Eve at its best
---
It's not really a "war" if one side is *this* objectively more powerful. Goons are reaping the rewards of all that krabbing and are very upset that that reward is a dead game.
---
Tell the world you're deploying, then wait a couple weeks, meanwhile your targets have left
---
Yes they are, by a long way.
---
I mean, a lot of shit is gonna die in delve during this CSM election deployment. Im not sure how this could age poorly unless the whaling stopped.
---
You can handwave it away as dumb crabs, but then again, anyone who goes exploring a dark alien cave full of creepy eggs is a dumbo as well.
---
I want a cruiser for huffing gas.
---
Let it have enough tank and light drones so a lone Astero will be a good fight.
---
Then I apologize, good sir.
---
We are going to have to repeat this so many times, there is always going to be a newBean that does not get the memo.
---
I admire your dedication and the result, but I worry for your sanity.
---
I would like to say, thank you behalf of Imperium to all NC. / PL / PH and their BatPhoners who punish those Imperium members in Delve who did not get this announcement. On other hand let me laugh at NC. / PL / PH who either are busy un-anchoring and evacuating their assets in north or who have deployed to empty delve and now banging their chest while screaming "Grrr goons, why you not fighting us in Delve!"
---
Is the resource resolution really that much better? The CPU I can clearly calculate the benefits of... but not the resolution.  
---
I do PI on 9 characters, so training all that to level 5 on all of them is a little scary to be frank.
---
How blody hard it is to use DD/MM/YY format? Stop being retard! Also stop running across of galaxy to avoid fighting us, we made a lot of effort to come to you up north and create content. WTF? Who does that?

You do realise that somebody *payed* you a few billion in capital mods, right? The net sum of that purchase in terms of wealth generation for Goonswarm is zero.

Hold on a minute..

We are getting content watching all the NC/PL/Horde bros spinning a narrative to make up for the fact that they already conceded they lost the war before it even started.
---
Just remake the This is Eve video every year
---
You mean causing your enemy to evacuate a large amount of assets at a significant cost isn't something that can be counted?
---
Either rigs and krabs count or neither count. Goons don't consider the dead krabs a loss and if you are implying the lost rigs aren't a loss either then nothing has happened yet.

Quality shitpost friend.

Asher got killed by Test, posted by a brave guy
---
What a world to live in
---
you gotta risk it for the biscuit bro
---
also that playing the whole victim card is pretty lame, you guys evicted us from the north and had ample time to build up - don't blame us for wasted opportunity
---
Theres no incursion in system
---
you got lucky , imagine sharing same corp with THEM
---
Flexing over economic numbers. Ok.
---
I know and? Its my wealth generation. The others made that money at some point. Im not a hard miner nor ratter. I am mostly out deployed to do pvp. Now i can generate great revenue while I cant go out ratting.
---
I'm not even spinning that tho? You don't take the fight if you are going to loose. We are doing the best we can to hurt goons, and it turns out that isn't fighting their deployment. We gave up, but we are killing things because of it. They want a fight, but aren't getting jack shit.
---
Maybe some sort of CCP issue, but Uemon was in incursion yesterday, not sure if that matters.
---
I live in the U.S. where it's MM/DD/YY.  I didn't realize I needed a disclaimer about r/eve not being a DD/MM/YY safe space. Please go back to Delve where none of us can hear you scream inanities.
---
Was able to light a cyno in different system in the same constellation as uemon
---
Yes, only as it turns out you can do it faster with more people.
---
Absolutely beautiful :-)
---
Odd but there was one earlier
---
Slap a relic scanner on an interceptor.
---
i don't get it
---
even in delve guys will be come our content \^\^ PH that is I love to kill more of you few dreads you have stage in npc delve
---
They'll tell you that Goonswarm krabs are accually all Panfam alts. Goons own you and me and everyone else. It is known.
---
it's okay I guess, but not as good as my corp's self-hosted eve-kill from 2011 tbh
---
Because local and intel channels don't work properly. CCPLS
---
Why would you want to be part of them? They cant even fight their own fights.
---
like we will rebuild the north. I've you even stay long anough to kill something at all... even when you burn the two regions ... it dosnt even take a wekk till all is in shape again. 
---
The question will be what you killed during the war. Is it structures or is it actually PVP...
---
you don't need to do it on All toons. Do it on one, see the difference :)
---
But yeah new heatspot appear and can make your heads go like +100% production (you will have a much more productive hotspot). Not always though, and not often +100%. but stil you can do like +20% (random value from my old memories) prod with just advanced.
---
As I get it(maybe I'm wrong), the process of producing resources on a planet is : create a new deep hotspot, that is a huge density in depth ; then every day, put that resource towards the surface and spread it a bit, lowering the resource density. With higher planetology you can see the deeper hotspot, so those with higher density, before they become less dense so you increase your production.
---
IIUC the "hotspot" have a limited lifetime, extracting them reduce that lifetime (or actually they have a minimum density after which they disappear), so when the resources on a spot is too low another hotspot is created on the next day somewhere on the planet.
---
Sometimes though there is no difference :P

Maybe in HS it's useless as the density of the hotspots is too low ?
---
Average player base age reaffirmed.
---
rumors say 1-smeb ihub is refed aswell. dunno which impact this have. According to your own coalition some month ago I-Hubs are VERY VERY IMPORTANT asset's
---
I'm not sure what to say because you are absolutely corret
---
 ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Not like you can move assets out before a structure unanchors or anything
---
this gave me aids
---
I'd host some sort of tournament between alliances and stream it
---
To confirm as I'm somebody who was on grid, numerous super capitals and several faxes jumped to the keepstar grid along with a decent sized Jackdaw fleet undocking (possibly jump clones or alts)
---
Deposit your loot into a random station and asset safety it to lowsec. Then you get it to jita with the cloak mwd trick.
---
You did not have to post this.
---
We started conscripting renters into our fleets a while ago. Is this just news now?
---
And it even has a bridge. Would be weird if that didn't get some sort of form up when it comes out of ref

How could panfam do anything but lose the war? Just look at the numbers on dotlan. Goons are literally double our size.
---
Their insurance values got nerferd, they’re not free anymore.
---
Cyno not working in a system with no incursion in lowsec, it worked 2j away in the same constellation
---
This is fake, right?
---
I once caught a JF who was moving stuff between two citadels in Syndicate, in same system.  Warped in a cloaked sabre 100km off on a ping between the two structures.  Watched him undock on another toon, decloaked and bubbled on my sabre and just feasted on the muppet as he sat 100km off his Citadel, dying.
---
Same could be said about Unspoken.
---
I liked the part when I saw a jumpgate for a moment.
---
Haven't kept track of you dudes since A-NI left TRI.
---
Given Saranen, this is isn't even delicious irony. It just tastes like dick.
---
Hahaha you're so mad. First you're utterly ridiculed for chest puffing after HK eviction, now bitter posting because your masters deployment got off to a terrible start. You used to be cool man, dump goons and start an insurgency like old times.
---
If the incursion was after last DT, the jamming can persist until the next dt.
---
Ah, we though Jita local memes were over. NEVER
---
I thought incursions were constellation wide ordeals. Even if that's the case I shouldn't have been able to light a cyno in tasti right
---
i have no idea but i know people have calculated these "delve minutes" before
---
lmao you obviously know nothing about what you are talking about mate
---
Ok google, how to delete someone else's reddit account.
---
I was on grind too we indeed jump a few there to but we still have good size of fleet in 1dq
---
didn't reikoku do this? then they died?
---
&gt; explain what’s currently happening, instead of “oh we killed bunch of your ships, you bads” and “This won’t dent our economy it makes no difference”
---
that *is* all that's happening so far
---
the operational theater of the war has shifted to reddit
---
Maybe create some new low sp ships? More corvettes that would allow them to smash into each other and do some early stuff whilst their skills build up?
---
Heeeeey! I think this picture is fake!
---
I hate those battles. That’s not why I will only play the game in null.
---
If it takes a lot of effort and skill, then it was worth it. If it's just killing dumb's, and doesn't matter, then it didn't take a lot of effort and skill
---
Fun is payment enough.
---
shocking that you agree with this post, its your level of retardness
---
Nice vid dude, love the moderat track.
---
Also thanks for the lay-down on Your recording setup, always interesting to hear how it's done.
---
actually its free because it was mined
---
Didn't want those industrialists anyways.
---
No reply yet
---
oooohhhh,.gotcha, tnx
---
They were never "free", they were jsut very cheap for what they potentially can do.
---
Now they are jsut slightly less cheap, but with the FAX nerf I suspect suicide dreads will still do significant work for their cost.
---
you know Goons ran just the same way in WWB right? You were less outnumbered then than PANFAM is now
---
I like it

Woah that was worst than I though
---
Channeling Stannis the Mannis in 2019? Here's your upvote.
---
I believe the war will be funnier in Delve than in the north.
---
Probably nobody will contest us Goons glassing tribute and that may be boring, while there can be some fun fighting all the groups fooling around in  Delve when the cat is away.
---
Nobody will keep the north unless goons stay deployed
---
If the North fights, the two largest coalitions will remain bluetral and shoot them, so why bother lmao
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Cloak_trick
---
I'm getting loads of content.
---
Matches the reddit narrative pretty well.
---
Lol no you don't
---
but how did they know we were deploying North before it was announced???
---
All 3 did. New Delve meta for Rorquals. Panic, then proceed to self destruct while in Panic.
---
But krabs dying in delve REEEE
---
That doesn't work because eve doesn't have a concept of a quarum for decisions.  At 49% (or even much lower) they can wait for the ceo to be offline for a few days, call a vote, and replace him.  The new CEO can then help himself to the corp assets before control can be reinstated.
---
He puts so much effort in it must be good.
---
Dock leave ship then enter ship again
---
Basically it's never been iterated on.  The current system is designed to allow groups to continue on if a CEO and section of shareholders leave the game, but they've never attempted to fix the holes.
---
Wasn't that the titan producing corp?
---
Probably 0.
---
Ironic.
---
I think you should fix
---
There are plenty of battles in NS that are not in deep TiDi for 4h.
---
Being a newbie in a carrier. Eve 2019..
---
I don't get why F1 monkeys beat chest like they're doing anything but being a ham fist key pusher.
---
Well, I’m not in the carrier, since it has to train up, that’s the whole point of the post...
---
This.
---
A
---
There is like 100k people in nullsec. Some will be retarded v0v
---
I think nobody in the history of titan battles have engaged knowing full well they will lose. Everyone has always believed there is a good chance for winning when deploying a titan fleet.
---
Just like PL could deploy titans vs test with no risk of losing 5 years ago, imperium can do the same against NCPL 2019. Its just a numbers game and no need raging about.
---
CE Region too lmao
---
I didn't know stating truths was spin these days?
---
You do realize JFs are a thing right? And btw if you pull rigs off structures they don't go to asset safety right?
---
Nice!
---
Is that just regular paper? It looks like it was drawn on a rough surface. Not a bad thing though, it really adds to the sketch :)
---
Ah well. Looked like the carrier needs to train to play with the big boys to me.
---
lol sanity wdym this is EVE we're talking about here
---
No one is saying that, lol.
---
“You should stop shooting attacking our krabs because you doing us a favour” will work, sure.
---
This is as idiotic as if a NC dude thanked Goons for shooting on their structures because they too lazy to unachor them.
---
Jesus christ, thanks for putting those two ships out of their misery
---
Actually, to be the same the NC structures would need to be anchored despite being told not to.
---
Really really good video
---
I have never felt the urge to fly caps, let alone titans.
---
If you want to aim for that, that's awesome but there are plenty of other ships you can fly and be useful in.
---
Want cloaky huffing Proteus fit please.
---
0/10 for accuracy, but upvoted for well-executed imagery.
---
If I only read 'The Art of War' I'd think they r not running from Goons, just selecting the war field
---
Actually, for me for the last few days, Eve is a "black screen for 4 minutes while logging in space, teleporting on the battlefield ships becuse of lag"
---
Fair enough, I’ll laugh at NC too if they say stupid shit like that as well.
---
Is supply and demand.  Simple
---
6k? Why you ignoring PH?
---
I second this, after not playing for 5 years this is what I came back too. Did it for a few months and then moved to NULL :)

---
I Cant even fly a carrier. But i like battleships
---
You do lose some of the value of the loot and need to wait to claim the items this way. It's It is very safe, but there costs to this method. Considering it's salvage, you may even be better off using a travle ceptor over anything else to haul it.
---
I honestly don't know what I did wrong? I logged in at least 16 times on different IRL dates and double checked to make sure I also logged in on different server dates. I have not received the final day? 
---
Was it programmed to have a 24h cooldown between? That would just be... ugh... so CCP
---
hahaha
---
We know Goons can dick swing through any region they want, we know this and that is expected.
---
We also know that we can now whale in Delve, something we were not expecting (last time they left the Umbrella intact). So the reality is turning out to be better than the expectation, hence, morale is actually up and up.
---
On the other hand, goons were promised dank content for all the suptits theyve been hoarding. At best, they get to shoot rando structures, get waterboarded and loose rando stuff here and there, I would be surprised if Panfam undocks anything bigger than dreads and carriers. At worst, they get huge tidifests with Panfams only goal to lengthen the cancerous experience of tidifest grids.
---
So there is a big gap here between what they were promised and expected and the reality hence we can see goons clinging to 'omg you're running and loosing, y u no fight, cowards!!'. 
---
Just on the isk factor alone, goons loses are rapidly approaching half a tril in day 2 of the war.
---
I just got a carrier.. after ten years :(
---
Hahaaa bi*** is butthurt AF 😂
---
[I think they are onto me](https://i.imgur.com/Y1SHd9R.png)
---
True indeed
---
why
---
I'd like to point out that you originally claimed 6k vs 35k. So while querns is certainly a fucking moron, you're looking like the head fucking retard around these parts
---
Titans and capital ships ruin eve anyway so its all good c:
---
That’s the thing, that kind of goon isn’t on jabber and doesn’t read the forums
---
That's the spirit!
---
So you mean NCPL deploy to delve pretty often to burn Imperium structure with supers and titan ?
---
Maybe to burn someone else space to avoid having to deal after 3 years of letting your enemy krab like crazy 500+ supers and titans moving up north and no one in the game with enough numbers to beat it ?
---
Nah sorry, I forgot, it's better to do nothing, shitpost on reddit and when shit hit the fan brag about pve kills then complain to CCP asking them to nerf the other side
---
It’s still a terrible piece of shit
---
TIL: Most of the wars throughout human history... weren't.
---
At the end, everyone knew they would go north and they took their super umbrella with them ... so NC might just leave north empty which means thousands of little bees will basically only have to fight the boredom of having no opponents left in that area, whilst the rest of eve knows that delve's hunting season just opened.
---
We have delve pest control
---
Maybe because it's a really bad image
---
there will not be such thing as  all out combat... this is why all udes wonder wtf goons like to accomplish in the first place. NO ONE will ever fight them anymore when they show up with several hundret titans. So another WWB is not going to happen again under courrent situation. They basicly have brought them self to a position where all they will do ist bashing structures in Titans. Maybe some Dreadbombs too but thats it. Eve then gets boring maybe at least for me.... and trust me i know this situation cause there are not many Alliances left which fight open combat vs. us too...
---
Sure thing. I only FC'd a bunch of those fights + was actually in the planning and coordination discord. But yeah you're totally right random dude on reddit.
---
You shouldn't have an issue with gate camps if you're in a covops frigate (Astero, Buzzard etc). Just try to warp to the gate from a random planet so your path isn't predictable - even if there's a bubble on the gate, you'll land in it with your cloak still on. Then you can slowly traverse the bubble without them noticing, and jump through. Once you're in lowsec, you should be next to impossible to catch. 
---
If you're not in a covops ship, just scan every system looking for a wormhole, and then scan inside the wormhole looking for more. Eventually you'll find a LS connection, as most k-space wormholes lead to lowsec.
---
So you say, fact is you're a d tier fc
---
Because seal clubbing to pad the “elite pveepee” status of the northern alliances is any better.
---
XD lol, I know that, I'm commenting more on the Irony of it.
---
https://prnt.sc/ne4wou
---
so 0.1%..0.5% of sales price matters in some way for you
---
Tbh im more interested in the exports graph for delve in the May econimic report
---
Happy cake day : )
---
Now, this is a proper sacrifice to the welp gods - not like those shitty Rorquals...
---
Well that's the sad part. Goons better not expect having a big titan brawl in this war, it's not going to happen.
---
Mostly structure bashes and getting raped in fleet fights when not outnumbering the enemy 3 to 1.
---
Due to current Eve mechanics, it's easier letting the enemy burn out itself on undefended structures and only showing up for guerilla op and guaranteed content.
---
So what were the results? And what were you looking for, initially?
---
Thank you! I always considered myself e-tier personally.
---
The fact that moaning about capital dominance today comes from PL is making me super fuzzy.
---
So much salt and we haven't even arrived in our destination yet :3
---
&gt;Losing more than you will destroy ?
---
This is not a relevant question.
---
Goons can loose more than the north , because we can replace it more easily.
---
The war is about weakening NC/ PL durably while maintaining our economical capacity to grow quicker than the rest. That is the real goal, not some ISK losses comparisons at some point in time.
---
yes kind a... my fun factor is still positive cause i like shotting ships way more then structures. But i have to be honest i dont think i will shoot much of you ships in north.
---
true
---
I like how the whole "war against botters" narrative is being pushed by Goons as if it was going to change anything.
---
good aar
---
Imperium can afford welping for months.  PanFam is piss poor.
---
It's still the Eve community so anything can happen
---
More ads on websites etc.  Tv commercial    advertise in game magazines.
---
Clear cache, maybe your client shows the lp but dont got them in the "LPbuytoolthing".
---
Or you file a ticket and a bug report both "F12"
---
Shit_post_btw
---
stfu dumbass lmao
---
I bought like 6 of these at some point a few years ago and figured I'd use one of get to 6RCQ and fight anyone I saw along the way. ADC would probably have been better but CBA. Weird fit though.
---
Not a Goon BTW, just a bystander commenting on logic :-)
---
Best of the shitposts around this war so far.
---
Thanks :) Stayed up a bit late to find the best pictures, since I thought that there will be much less interest the next day
---
It wouldn't work. In reality, company directors have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the company, for the benefit of the shareholders. A breach of a fiduciary duty incurs potential criminal penalties. 
---
In Eve, a corp director can clear out the corp, start a new one with the looted assets, and the shareholders of the first corp have zero recourse.
---
Less than100 mill an hour and relieing on luck for good drops just go to highsec and 10 hours of incursions in complete safety gets you 1.5 billion plus lots of concord loyalty points
---
Yeah, its on watercolour paper with a rough surface - never know if im going to add paint though it can be difficult to add finer details
---
Better than being led by a leadership team that doesn't like to undock.
---
we had a super mentor and famous eve overlord calling this the "fabian strategy" in another war some time ago. And he was right this fucks up the morale from the attacker. Worked for them way better ten for us :) 
---
And before some idiots get triggered it was WWB and all other names are just inside goon names.
---
Thats not really setting the bar very high
---
Bah! Incursions are a pain in the butt.   
---
Besides that, If I remember correctly, In order to get that kinda ISK Solo, you need to Multibox and make some pretty heavy Investments ISK and Skill wise.
---
tbh he did say they are moving everything so if you have little brain to thing for yourself you'll figure out that you either move with them or dock up and go play something else...
---
In theory, this problem should solve itself once there are many chinese player actively part of Nullsec, right?
---
Striker, have you just denied PornMaker a JF kill with this bug? omegalul
---
In the soviet union the commissars drew wages. In Goonswarm our enemies do it for us.
---
How would it?
---
And you could easily have still "time windows" for the reinforcement mechanic, instead of the straight X hours after the hit thing of POS. That way, you would have the best of both systems.
---
Because there always needs to be balance in the universe.
---
Eve would be boring and stale as fuck if anyone you hated didn't play.
---
Shiiit boiiii even as a solo player I will stage a dread or 2 in Delve and drop it when things get hot ! I wanna shit in the bus too !
---
i thought CCP announce highest numbers of botters are in goons and frt? why are u trying hide that fact .
---
When you hint "we're firing up the supers" a week before moving, they knew
---
true and if all those assets where mined by us we lost basicly nothing. Same as you... so we can end the war before it started basicly. You lost 0 we lost 0 
---
We at least had fun getting frags in PVP not structure bashing :)
---
Because the AUTZ would no longer be the best spot necessarily. It is right now, because it usually is the timezone with the least activity. Once there is one (or more) big alliances in that timezone, lurking to attack your space once you move the invul timers to that timezone (and aren't able to defend it yourself anymore), it's not longer a viable option anymore, is it?
---
you're here too.
---
you can make money but be clever enough to not do stupid stuff like that. Not hard. But too hard for some :=)
---
Chinese are still working during AUTZ so I think it would still be best.
---
"TZ tanking is shit, but if my enemy complains about it, it's stupid he does"
---
lel look at you guys and your sunk cost fallacy. cute
---
they can kill missiles if you time them properly
---
People are running them in t1 battleship alpha accounts but yea they are not a solo activity which is why I like them
---
Arghbaaargh?
---
What about the cost of all the modules you had to tear up for evacuating a whole region? Add that to the bill please?
---
Yeah same problem, logged in right after downtime instead of before and missed a day
---
I haven't played in 6 month (after 11 years) but am on this stupid fucking sub every day.
---
So, yes. Yes I am.
---
It's called fabian strategy sweetie, look it up
---
wormholer btw
---
Play long enough and you'll understand.
---
Great video!  
---
Can you please share your overview settings?
---
I don't know what you mean by Timezone then. For me it is the time where the asien/australian people are most active. The same way the USTZ and EUTZ are the times where the majority of those players are most active.  
---
Which time in EVE do you call the AUTZ? Maybe that will help me understand.
---
Isn’t Tribute supposed to be on fire?
---
There are several ways to "Play the game".
---
Who are we to say this is not how it should be done?
---
Besides, it appears he is winning a lot at his game, and we goons are benefiting a lot from it. So why would we not allow it?
---
First off He's the fucking Mittani (Pbuh) and He's forgotten more about this game then you will ever learn. Second, you don't generate a multi-dollar media empire without knowing your spreadsheets.Third, tell your friend to eat our Dear Leader's ass.
---
I can't imagine mittani doesn't know that ...
---
I mean it was pretty nice to watch on twitch, the big show and the moving starts and all ... but what do goon-membes really expect here to happen? Moving 1.000+ titans + who knows how many ships besides that ... i mean just that number ... 1.000 titans ... who in eve will even think about putting anything on a field, where you not only can, but will eventually get dropped by that ...
---
That huge number is nice for show, but nothing else. And that will lead to that point where basically everyone in eve will have fun ... by going to delve and kill stuff, whilst the imperium goes from empty system to empty system
---
Aye, Mittens rarely is seen leading our fleets in battle, but that doesn't mean he isn't there. He plays the game like a person plays Chess or Risk. Planning from outside the game. Day to day operations in the Imperium are dealt with by Directors, Sub-Directors, and CEO's.
---
Yup, it's the same for me ...
---
Fun is subjective, I know heaps of retards ingame who love sitting around a structure, hanging out with friends and getting a killmail
---
Well, it's cheap compared to ALL those lovely billions and billions and even more billions of modules you've torn up in moving your structures...
---
This is a pretty good fix.   
---
I would not make it this 100%, but very close.
---
Well, of they have stamina to 24/7 farm for 3 years...
---
it was 'battleship or bust' in a game where most large groups had one titan - but using more than one was unusual. So while you could tank to survive one DDD as a fleet - no guarantee you'd continue to survive. These days if remote DDD still existed it'd be like a disco show with how many can be mustered to fire.
---
I haven't heard the actual story to that claim I've seen before yet. Can you enlighten me what that alleged exploit was?
---
If we accomplish this by being led by someone who "doesn’t play the game nor keeps up to date with what is happening in said game"
---
Imagine what a competent leadership would turn goons into.
---
Nope they are in the russian and northern renting alliances
---
I guess supers would cost 1b in delve.
---
A good micro/small gang nightmare is always active. [https://zkillboard.com/kill/74850479/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/74850479/)
---
Abyss rolled AB and a fancy shieldboost will make it very capable of engaging a couple svipuls, the support is more important here, Loki can nicely help to peel svipuls off the Nightmare while pulling range, but a Strat is a terrible choice, jumping into them could also end badly, I'd call an alignment and set up at 70.
---
Cuz it's worked out pretty well?
---
Well, it's not a suprise at all. After DeadCo have lost the war and Sort signed the agreement, he was asked if they will use the time to adapt and rebuild. His answer was "that's not up to me, but up to the members". If you have such attitude as a leader of an alliance/coalition, you are ultimately doomed to be the playball of your surroundings.
---
There was An incursion in this constelation it hot headshotted earlyer but sometimes it takes till after DT for the systemwide jammer to go away becaus :ccp:
---
Nice AAR. Someone why he was out of tether? lol
---
I am not sure if you're really weakening NC/PL ... at the end, they already put down all kinds of structures, moved assets into other systems. Ofc it's still a big logistical amount of work to do that and there are probably tons of citadels left. But i'd say you're putting more effort alone in moving all your stuff to the north, whilst you lost your super umbrella in delve. 
---
And by pushing out all information to the public, basically everyone knows where you are with what, at what times ... so all the hunters that so far couldn't really do much in delve, now have the greatest time in your home, whilst you move stuff to destroy another alliances home. Only difference, once you get there, probably almost nothing will be there for you to shoot.
---
At the end ... Imperium got so big, that getting to the warzone takes longer then for your opponent to evacuate their area.
---
Just imagine you would have had your meeting on sunday but without any information before that, so besides mittani and some other high ranking directors nobody would have known about the war mittani started. Notification about war on saturday, moving starts sunday ... NC/PL got not 2 weeks to prepare evacuation of their regions.
---
It's like in real ... when one country invades another country, they usually don't tell them weeks before hand, that they're about to come, but plans will be made by high ranking ppl, without letting anyone know about it ... and then it suddenly starts ...
---
we have rorquals?
---
lol GOTB really are shit.
---
The biggest oof
---
Has it?
---
It could probably be better surely?
---
 Morale is what really wins wars. All those titans are useless if no one shows up to fleets to create Ihub timers, take down cyno jammers, and take down Ihubs. 
---
And the more damage the north does now the more likely the Imperium is to devote resources to keeping Delve safe, at least for certain time periods every few days, which would relieve some pressure on the north. But they can’t do that without people logging in and joining fleets. 
---
So both sides are in full propaganda mode right now, and it’s honestly only going to escalate as the war picks up.
---
The first rule is die quit. So nothing new.
---
Did you know that we have Imperium builders supplying us with dreads?
---
Posting a presumption as a fact, you're not very bright are you? You know you could look at the released stats yourself?
---
Damn, you got me.

The rigs war
---
Because, in my corp, I like what I see.
---
That's half the charm
---
Which Corp?
---
No mineral for rig. Just salvage.
---
Rig, particulary XL t2  one can be VERY expensive.
---
&lt;20 hrs a week. I probably spend more time in the gym than on eve.
---
Edited with great taste, congrats!
---
I can get behind the idea of weakening the enemy, though it seems a little far fetched to think it weakens anything. North (outside of maybe horde) is not up to date regarding current industry meta, so you may achieve the exact opposite by forcing people out.
---
Also I don't get what goons would gain by weakening the only "opposing" force they have. No content for a while if it works ? 
---
As it stands, nobody in space is a threat to goonswarm as a whole, outside of maybe themselves.
---
i Heard World of Warcraft Vanilla mode is out soon, PL Leadership will have plenty of content there
---
Hi, visible light cannot get into or out of the brain unless a hole is made in the skull.
---
lmao
---
Not much is going to die, relative to the amount of stuff there.  Actually this will be a good experiment for what happens when you remove local and/or remove capital umbrellas.  What you find is that the number of targets in space reduces close to zero, so you don't actually kill any more than you did before.
---
That's after the initial onslaught of course, where the people who aren't really engaged with the alliance and don't know what's going on, or who ignore advice because they know better and also because they're safe because they've got slaves (the low hanging fruit) get popped.
---
you see, they don't have to run faster than goons
---
they just have to run faster than all their assets in the north
---
I've given buster some of my footage, including that beautiful explosion in high quality. Hopefully a great video comes out of it!
---
everything fine. Even when you where one maybe you had fun shooting strucs and then we would be both happy :)
---
No totally not addicted, I can stop any time I want, I just don't want to.  
---
Depends, if I don't have any obligations IRL, I can play 14-16 hours a day for weeks in a row, but in work season I sometimes don't log in for months.

Undocked and probably went afk, forgetting to stop his ship. Then he got bumped by a FAX that also moonwalked out, AFAIK

11 carriers
---
This is pretty bad and you should look up the rules dude this is getting to far we all play eve and its a game some of you are taking this war and propaganda shit way to far
---
trillions of trillions of ASSETS and stuff.... we are so DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMED
---
have fun and keep bragging this shit :)
---
Thats not hard they most times are on public contracts all you have to do is assest safety
---
Not a lot has happened yet really. Goons did their first couple move ops up north but it'll be probably another day or two before the start sending out actual start op fleets. I think they deployed to 6RCQ in Cloud Ring (the regional gate into Fade) but idk I haven't been paying a lot of attention to it.
---
Meanwhile in Delve, there's always been a lot of folks who care more about getting big frags than the political allegiances of the groups they're members of and have a surprisingly large amount of logistics in NPC Delve. Obviously there's bombers bar and Marshy doing his thing, but you've got other folks with dreads/carriers and even titans/supers on occasion. Every time goons deploy those groups go nuts for a few weeks and rack up piles of big frags on people who needed to learn the hard way that they are infact not very good at the game and the only reason they got away idiotic shit they did was the training wheels of some competent people with ping power and a fax wall to save them.
---
It's also worth noting that those groups aren't an organised PL/NC/V0lta/Snuff teaming up thing, it's just industrious individuals in those groups who're friends.
---
We have about a hundred people, all time zones, so there is always someone on to talk to.  We mine while on comms, so we don't get spod-brained.  we fleet in everything from 5 man gangs to 250 man fleets.  We defend our space against roamers and fleets (some really fun battles come from rorqual saves, to be honest).  We build ships, fit ships, and debate ships, the shooting of ships, and the ever-present Eve politics.
---
It's like people couldn't understand what we or their CEOs tell them.
---
Karmafleet
---
That’s awesome, thank you so much. I really wanted to start skill farming and had no clue about how to do it. Could you do a tutorial about how to take a shit next because I feel I’m ready for it now but a step by step guide would definitely help.
---
Yikes

1 titan for me = 4 days &lt;3

Damage cap on subcaps (it's Monday and I didn't have enough coffee)

I'll be downvoting
---
Evolved into something greater.
---
he didn't say anything about brains; you should probably check for a hole because i think yours has fallen out
---
well, it's shit now except very few dedicated tasks, just inject 3 rorq like every other newbie does
---
2019 eve online meta, unanchor your keepstars and stash them in npc stations until goons leave, it's the next best thing to cloaky citadels
---
+1
---
I think im going to miss the last reward as well. 
---
But hey thats life.
---
It's almost like we spelled out that we'd be executing a Fabian strategy and have done exactly that since the C02 backstab, and all what we've predicted is coming to pass.
---
did we find /u/marinatefoodsfargo new account
---
For Panfam maybe
---
Imagine shit posting for a war that you're running away from
---
...
---
Oook, damn. I dont like where this is going.
---
&gt;I think nobody in the history of titan battles have engaged knowing full well they will lose.
---
Both X47 battles, and certainly the last timer, were joined by the north despite being against the odds.
---
Carrier isn't exactly newbie, but wearing a plastic monocle definitely earns you wanabe points.
---
after all failed attempts CCP: okay, this time!
---
Who does want people that can't follow basic instructions?
---
I live in the area I do exploration in. When i have over 500 in cargo i start to scan the whs i find on my explo route and almost everytime i find a low/hs exit pretty fast
---
Who wants half of your MER?
---
only summer children who haven't been in 1% tidi want this to be a fighting war
---
?? what's this?
---
Hur dur, the MER isn't important.
---
It's very well organized. Great leadership. Lots of people to talk to. 1-3 fleets per hour if you count both the alliance pings and coalition pings. Plenty of space to make isk. And agree with Imperiums perspectives and culture.
---
&gt; 6RCQ in Cloud Ring (the regional gate into Fade)
---
kinda looks that way, which is mega chinthinkers
---
i thought gotg were their allies? why deploy to fade
---
Caracal? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEgThIUyfOA
---
XD I actually do this to escape Bubbles.   
---
Aline, then quickly pop Micro then cloak. It can normally rocket you out 30-40km away from the Gate before the Bombers can get a bead on you, and they'll often miss their bombing by quite a bit.
---
So let me get this straight cause it appears this is the only thing I see on reddit. The north is unanchoring anything that is worth a dime and is preparing to lose their homes and their rental empires and pretty much everything in the next couple of weeks, but you people are cheering for goons losing 0.001% of their pve capabilities while things are getting into motion? 
---
I guess you take what you're given, but this chest beating looks a little ridiculous to me.
---
Anyone who doesn't use YYYY-MM-DD timestamps is a fucking animal.
---
Precisely ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Especially when they bought all that fuel from the enemy... oh wait, maybe money just changed hands from one goon to the next you know...
---
Hes thinking of the most recent bans rather than the historical data
---
This is nullsec end-game content. 10/10 would unsub again.
---
I'd look for another job. CCP's leadership has no clue what is wrong with their game and has not done anything to fix the same problems - player retention, balance, finding worthwhile things to do at all ends of the SP scale - for years, leading to the game bleeding players.  
---
They've turned it into a grindfest, along the line of "with injectors and rorquals, you too can be a high level player with multiple titans if you keep your head down and bot enough ISK for long enough", but it only goes so far, and if they had the balls to do a reset we'd know about it by now.  
---
Those of us who love the game are doing our best to enjoy the ride, doesn't mean we don't know where it's headed.
---
Playing a lot of hours doesn't mean you are addicted to it.
---
Half? Your maths is terrible
---
Just don't tell anyone about it and keep it isolated from your main character. No isk transfers etc :)
---
You can drop cans to space and then pick the stuff up with your alt to tranfer money so it doesn't show up in API's.
---
Im curious who can hear Tribute crying/screaming!
---
BOOM BOOM soon!
---
&gt; They can cycle their DD's on a Tidi grid with no baddies
---
but they can't tho, you can only shoot a dd at a capital ship, not a structure (anymore)
---
Wait, really? a  Caracal?  Dear lord, I've not touched one of those in years.
---
To go "full panfam" we would need to use the WWB syllabus for damage estimation and assume each structure undeniably had multiple titans in production even after months of continuous fighting, double that estimate every few days without further justification and regardless of the number of new structure kills, to ultimately conclude we have without a doubt killed something on the order of half their standing fleet.
---
Just moving to area where one of the last 100% focused pvp groups live... kinda kamikaze planning from your leadership.
---
okay first of all, beta is out now, release is set for late august, and i'm very hype
---
second of all, you probably think you're memeing but i'll bet you $20 that there's a channel full of pl duders playing it on launch day lead by dancul and /u/doomchinchilla  
---
^^and ^^then ^^they ^^stop ^^playing ^^two ^^weeks ^^later ^^when ^^they ^^get ^^bored
---
tell me i'm wrong doom
---
this shit need to get pind well rip eve yet another mobile sell out
---
closed beta now, stress tests TBA, full release 27 august
---
i'm sorry i must have missed the part where we evac'd did you see which way we went
---
Well, I think Mittani held the info as long as he could.  But for such a big deployement , there was such a great deal of logistics involved, that it could not be kept secret any longer.  
---
Anyway unanchoring structures is not free. you are destroying clones, sending assets into safety. 
---
Also don't forget the morale of the troups. Even if you call it a strategic retreat, it's hurting feelings for elite players to be kicked out of their home. A few of them will go AFK after this.  For Goons it will be a boost to Force NC/PL out even if we have losses. 
---
It will be difficult to evaluate correctly the reult of this war. Maybe indeed a full deploiment is not something goons should do anymore,  but we don't loose to much in experimenting, so i think it was worth a try. As long as the lessons are learnt, we will be better prepared for the future.
---
Seems unlikely in practice.
---
Something Something sand to the beach.
---
&gt;raise you obscure Titan references through Anime, shitty editing and memes.
---
Never not
---
this is especially poignant because mittani explicitly said in his sotg that the goal wasn't to hold or even take panfam's space, just to "glass" it and further protect their strategic advantage
---
i imagine they'll probably bash the forts and keeps that are left anchored with stratop level fleets, and probably kill most of our ihubs through sheer weight of autism. i bet they'll probably also go after renter structures, maybe with those bright-eyed skirmish fcs and hundreds of welpable carriers he talked about
---
then, after a couple of weeks when they're satisfied that tribute and vale don't look like anything, they'll probably go home
---
realistically the renter structures are probably going to be the biggest pinatas, as renters tend to be dumb and not listen to simple concepts like "set your vuln timers to the proper time zone" and "tell us when your structures get reinforced"
---
The real dealer doesnt snort his own stuff either  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
It is actually a game of who gets bored first. The north not finding any more whales to hunt (since all the not so intelligent ones were already killed) or imperium grinding through the entire panfam + renters space. 
---
Cause setting all that infrastructure back may take a while, but convincing renters to join your space you can't defend is probably gonna take longer. And since elite pvpers  are not doing indy and ph is full of awoxers (not a word, I know) it will be interesting to see how are these elites going to get their next batch of supers (other than putting alts in karmafleet that is).
---
too real
---
That logic checks out.
---
30+ hrs per week, give or take lm less active when wars am on as a miner by traded l just sell my ore in these times then once its over go back to mining
---
It’s a bad solution, to a problem
---
If that was true Stain would have TWO lowsec gates already.
---
Oh yes, when I tried abyssals in a caracal it did pretty well. Vexor worked fine too. Basically just fly something that can apply damage at ~30km+ and is pretty fast.  
---
Now if you want a fun thing to do, try the 3 frigate fleet t1 abyss solo in a Kestrel, now that's a rush.
---
By that logic a lot of Krabs reside in C5 space, along with most of the larger pvp groups.
---
everyone is saying that. each. and every. one of them.
---
will do senpai
---
You could get away without it. Having said that, my collection of scanning alts is always growing, and the older ones are slowly but surely all getting virtues...
---
More safe than most links on Reddit. It's items made by prisoners in prison like shanks, games weapons and the odd sex toy. Quite ingenuous really. I liked the chess board from rocks and tiles.
---
All this work yet you post screenshots of your achievements via fucking Gyazo
---
Shame
---
I bet it was 50k plex in that yacht...
---
If there omega props to the financial dedication
---
Tbh some of the people in 2-5/NS holes really don't do anything for anyone. There are a couple at least who only have the static set so they can krab out of their C5.
---
I'm guessing you didn't read downwards from user 01 -09?
---
People are saying “Why you not go back and fight us in Delve”?

Why would anyone like to get counterdropped by a supercap umbrella?

---
The rigs cost more than the hulls. The extinction rigs require 8 separate salvage, the smallest number at 80,000 ea.
---
The bottlenecks of salvage is, IMHO, the main thing in the game keeping the Nullsec empires from going crazy building serious industry infrastructure.
---
Good thing it's not even paid or developed by ccp
---
Guide: Get a 5-5. The big groups will respect you if you don't act like douchebags and panic roll the moment you see them. 5-5 offers a lot of incoming connections (C5 connections are abundant) and potentially huge chains off the C5 highway.
---
We all just want more fights and more pvp groups in high class space is good for all of us.
---
CCP boss: we need to check all new usernames to see if they're rude when combined with other usernames!
---
Dev: ...?!&amp;*
---
NCdot and Panfam tearing down rigged structures just created massive demand for salvage throughout EVE.
---
If you are sitting on salvage stock piles, now may be the time to sell.
---
The reason Goons would be alone if they didn't have NCPL is because NCPL either killed or drove everyone else into the Imperiums arms.
---
Imagine how many new alliances might pop up if all that empty NCPL space was freed up.
---
Oh no, not the precious MER.  Whatever will we do.
---
Still iam not sure if we where on one of those lossmails... so your point is pretty useless. You get farmed by basicly all of eve and make us resposible for it... i mean your coalition leader told everyone that delve is undefended and dudes get cought die. What did you expect will happen.... 
---
This is what brings me to the anger part. I play eve since 2007 and had so many wars vs GSF.... it is always the same hurf blurf crap. there is basicly nothing we could do beside Drop all we have in a single engagement and die. Should this happen ofc we are still retarded cause we did what we did.
---
Have fun
---
aah yes you mean the "Proof" that when you put some of the best pvpers this game has, into one small entity, they can actually hold space as long as the empires ignore them.
---
Time to pack our shit, we're done. One MER out of dozens is gonna look bad
---
Nice old school reference. I member those days.
---
Basically I also made a post for this, which is getting up and downvoted depending on who is voting (lolo) but we have seen these reactions the last times when there was war. Once Delve is announcing a deployment, some space-entities are reaction with the typical hide and seek-"tactics". They leave their home, flee anywhere in space, then mostly come to delve to pretend that goons are losing their capitals and that they never knew about any deployment. This time at least they admit that there is an actualy deployment so they say "goons are too slow" and "pl was bored to wait" or some other shit.   
---
I am agreeing to you 100% that fighting these ammounts of titans and supers  by goons would be a loss for the most alliances, on the same hand those guys shouldnt deploy to reddit and scream up like .... \* marking all shitpost-threads. \*
---
Panfam already win this game. They just destroy targets both sides and left nothing to goons.
---
The deployment against BOT is not against botters but rather just against the alliance "brothers of tangra" or BoT.
---
The reason is simple: burn other renter empires so goon renter empire looks better than the burnt ones
---
&gt;3 frigate fleet t1 abyss solo
---
Ehem..
---
&gt;3 frigate
---
&gt;solo
---
Multiboxing != Solo
---
[oh?](https://i.imgur.com/5PWgL5P.gifv)
---
There are all of about 2 C3 pvp corps I know of, and seeing as C3 wormholes have no static wormhole space connections (in other words, for anyone reading this who doesn't know already, C3 wormholes rely entirely on their incoming wormhole connections or the chance at a random spawn for wormhole connections - they're only guaranteed a single kspace) this comment seems like a bit of an odd thing coming from you, whose home has a C3 static.
---
i liked some of the comms added and music was excellent, i d consider making it shorter, split the footage in smaller films, but thats just me ;p
---
about posturing...
---
goons rolled well in excess of 100t in hardware north and left easily 10x that floating in space in delve, while the sum total of the damage in delve so far wouldn't even be a crippling blow to the super fleets of many individual players.
---
it may be more success than panfam would otherwise encounter at this point in the "farm eachother's renters" cycle, but you should probably still retain some context to use as lube when beating yourself off this ferociously
---
Probably already been replaced O.o
---
Its fine. But we both know that as soon as citadels start dying in the north people will make propaganda about it on reddit. It will happen, so its the same thing here.
---
Ah, yes. The old heavy-web, bulkhead, skirmish link Rorq. A real classic.
---
The site is meant for 3 frigates, you do them with one Kestrel.
---
Are the goons bankrupt if the mer shows zero for a month? This could be serious!!!
---
We're talking about smoothbrains like yours "DelveGuy".  There's very little refraction or reflection going on inside the skull.  There is some of course but it's mostly infrared, not visible.
---
Surprisingly, it seems you are the one who is not up to date on the definition of 'literally'! 
---
&gt;: in effect : VIRTUALLY —used in an exaggerated way to emphasize a statement or description that is not literally true or possible.
---
"Will literally turn the world upside down to combat cruelty or injustice"
---
https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/literally
---
Assault frigates like Retribution &amp; Hawk can comfortably solo T1&amp;T2 abyss sites that are designed for 3 frigates. 
---
Apparently you can do T3 as well but you gotta be really on the ball with it, which pretty much rules my drunk ass out :)
---
Same shame.
---
no worries, friend.  if you fill a few more pages of r/eve with duplicate threads bleating about killing two titans surely we will see the light.
---
this is FALSE.. there where in fact almost no tidi on sisi.. we where kinda surprised by that. Are they running the 64 bit client already? idk.
---
I read this as “CCP Manbun” the first time through...
---
You don't get it. People who can't follow basic instructions make up half your MER. I know because I kill them.
---
Glad im not the only one 😭
---
Especially in terms of PvE there is a lot of setup and effort involved for many people so evaccing is at least a major pita for PanFam. But yeah if they do it right they deny goon fleet ops virtually all content except for structure grinds so in the end it's a loss-loss. Which in turn is a loss for the Imperium members since they invaded and were promised content. Politically it's a win for the Imperium ofc but that is expected since they are the biggest coalition in the game.
---
The ISK involved don't matter all that much. PanFams citadels have returned their investment many times by now even with expensive rigs and Goons and Friends can replace many more Titans than 1-2 per day.
---
How to optimize?
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Eve) if you have any questions or concerns.*
---
&gt; The deployment against BOT is not against botters ...
---
You say that as if BOT has actual human players.
---
no you don't understand this time it's different and uniquely significant that they've inflicted 0.1% of the value of the invading force in damage
---
here I'm going to post another thread with a link to the same kills so you can begin to grasp the magnitude
---
Did you use a out-of-game tool to optimize waypoints?
---
Well they do
---
One of the saltiest carebears i have ever seen

Even more salty than suitonia when he doesn't get his honobru fights

---
Real Titan pilots auto-pilot to deployments.
---
Look if they inhabit the same universe pc players do im down for it. I doubt anyone playing on a phone is going to fight very well
---
Just remember guys, mobile is huge in Asia. This is not aimed at us, nor do I think it ever will be. I do not think CCP expects us to want this game, hence we are finding out about it from cammed footage of a Chinese stream.
---
I miss you mate.
---
Psssst... i just gated 10 bil in unused bs from 15W to navula even without a scout... guess what happened...
---
Nothing.
---
Most of the "krabs" have deployed Olmeca.  After the initial culling of the low-hanging smoothbrains, which I'm sure you will manage without too much trouble, you will get to see what you've always wanted to see: hunting in Delve without a supercap umbrella.
---
I predict you won't find that many targets, or that the number of targets will remain roughly constant because as you may realise, without an umbrella most people don't undock and play with expensive toys.
---
I think NC has more rorquals than supercapitals tbh
---
Can you mine AT ships?
---
How did you come up with half though?  Or are you just pulling numbers out your a$$?
---
any BPO worth while will cost you billions, your then gona have to spend time and isk on research and eff, once thats done your still if your very lucky only selling your bpc for double digits, which means it's going to be months, possibly well over a year before you start to see a return on your investment.
---
Another option is to buy a BPO pack for a popular ship, like lets for example say the Orca in highsec, or a capital in null sec, your gona buy the BPO for every part needed to build the final thing and then sell packs of the BPC's with the exact number of runs needed to build the final product, this might make you some isk but your still going to selling for a long time before you actually start making a return on your investment.
---
yes, at 2020 will include a mining league
---
Double-sided cleansing. Deploy north to cleanse that area of "renters" (read: botters), while the rest of EVE cleanse Delve of the dead weight there.
---
Can't say I've got a problem with any of that.
---
Didn't you invent badposting
---
Based
---
You know there are 100s more alliances in Eve not just Goons.
---
Me too.
---
So you're saying it's magic right?
---
According to a reddit post yesterday, we were bankrupted by the fuel cost of the move op.
---
what's the end game? a gated nature reserve for bees where they can roam freely as nature intended?
---
Of course we can disown the handful in our thousands of pilots, who are incapable of understanding what "krab and you will die"
---
F
---
It was.  Basically an incursion fucked up our cyno chain, causing us to go through territory that was blue to TEST, but not to my PAC.
---
The second loss was all me.  An incursion fucked up our cyno chain, causing us to re-route through territory that was blue to TEST, but I forgot that it might not be blue to my PAC.  
---
So I cyno'ed in and couldn't dock.  And naturally the locals didn't care that it was a TEST PAC alt.
---
Outrageous! Goons need to invest in some Rorquals. Bring those prices down.
---
am asian can confirm
---
mobile bigger than moon
---
It's Olmeca, take a wild guess
---
Ass numbers.   Check.
---
I don't see the "killed or drove everyone".
---
The only case I can see is TEST, which is kinda PL's fault for bullying them at the end of WWB, which they paid dearly last year when they tried to bully TEST again and got handed their asses.
---
If you're talking about DeadCo, I believe sort is killing himself, no need of external forces.
---
That's good news for radakos
---
Well, seeing there is only one supercap sotiyo and it was unanchored, it could be difficult to say.
---
Don't assume the North as the industrial capability of goons at any point in time.
---
...the two are not related
---
As it's 2019 now, we should all be using stardates, e.g. 96982.84.
---
AAR: I was the dread that got caught. I was in fountain when a carrier got caught and my friend didn't have a carrier to assist, when the niddy got saved I went, "it is AUTZ, should be fine" blind jumped into ZXB and got caught by a bubbler who kept me locked down until his friends showed up. At first it was like 7 bombers, then more and more kept showing up. I already was trying to wake people in comms, but it was dead silent. I didn't get any pings, so I just sat and went "Welp, this is how I die. I just had to be lazy and not switch to my haws. I am an idiot."
---
The widow landed, something I can actually kill with xl torps! I got him to 50% armor before he decided to stay the fuck away. Kept him locked so no cloaky. A neuting sin appears at 27km, i jump in joy, but he fucks off when I got a lick. A bit after a neuting rorqual lands. Something I can kill! I switch to XL rages target paint his ass and went for it. I went for a last ditch effort putting in intel a rorqual landed, and few minutes later my dumbass was saved and the rorqual died.
---
In the end I tanked 8.59million EHP.
---
Here is the battle graph. They did use focus voids. http://imgur.com/BlGI5r3.png
---
Naw, I totally understand what reddit is.  I'm having a blast.  Hell, talking smack is one of the most fun parts of war :)
---
I'm not butt hurt.  In fact, this is exactly what I'm, saying - we deployed, and told people not to go out ratting.  Some did anyway, and results were as expected.  SO some ratters feed during deployment - that's not exactly a huge victory or anything.
---
I didn't refuse to count horde, I said it is stupid to count it as a whole.But that was not my point.The point is the different size of the two coalitions.Also no, no one could out recruit goons, people who are mostly interested in mining with multiple rorquals or chaining anomalies with a super won't join pl or nc.
---
Or maybe just do the same as we and keep having fun. That remind me that we have still some cards in our hand to play.
---
&gt; it was WWB and all other names are just inside goon names.
---
As a relatively new Imperium member (joined about a year or so ago), I'm pretty adamant that I will not refer it it as anything but WWBee.
---
Not saying you are wrong, but keep in mind that it also makes it also even easier for botters to stay in buisness uninterrupted.
---
It's not the end of the world either. so man up
---
Yeah can confirm my super is still evaced in the same location like 2 month ago.
---
But in the email its said until 20 of may not until DT 20 of may. So they should give it all day until tomorow.
---
I guess. But damn it, just 2 clicks and I could have gotten free 1 mil SP. Such small effort for such large gain.  
---
At least I got all the other bonuses like skins...
---
Sucks to be you fam &lt;3
---
Probably blind because of Koolaid, supers were pretty visible in 15w over the weekend.
---
woosh.
---
Is it still profit these day? I have some characters with PI skill is it good for SP farm?
---
SWAG - Scientific Wild-assed Guess
---
Can I just have Jibrish touch me while you watch?
---
This
---
PBUH!
---
I think each day probably started and ended with daily downtime. That could easily make you login twice on the same day without realizing.
---
Yes I meant that they won't make undefended structure bashings and more likely go to geminate and have some fights
---
And you have to love the new "Eat our Ass" agenda
---
There is something wrong with that. I´ve logged in during morning before DT and right after DT and nothing happened... WTF
---
That is true, my fault for not counting everyone when making the first comment.Yet my point was that they have way more people, a point that is true even with every alliance counted
---
Expand the first coloumn
---
I logged in for 14 years and forgot to log in the last 2
---
Plus the game has changed to the point that farmers are more attracted to the game now than PVPers.
---
You could stage your explorer out of Thera - that way you can access null regions directly without the hassle of moving there from high/low.
---
I was on vacation for most of the login bonus campaign. Nothing for me.
---
bear in mind that unopposed structure bashes are still pap-worthy and therefore classified as "enjoyable content" by dear leader
---
I think need to write a petition.
---
Lmao the shit you keep pulling off is hilarious. Keep up the great videos! :)
---
This question could, perhaps, be likened to the question "Well how can you be led by a CEO that doesn't actually work on the assembly line?"
---
The game has many levels of play, just like a business does.
---
 My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through." I agreed. At 25, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this post gave me cancer anyway.
---
This is what tricked me into thinking I could get it too. Really frustrating, if nothing else.
---
It's not that much.  I mean with omega, remap and implants, it's about 2 weeks isn't it?
---
Yeah RIP SP, I thought we had today which worked out nicely with work arrangements meaning I had to be away from my PC for a bit last weekend. This should really be clearer in the marketing email for something so major as the whole event just feels bad now for anyone who missed the last day.
---
That's exactly the point tho : goons will flex saying "we killed x keepstar, y fortizar, took z systems". Answer will be "we killed for the same amount of money in delve ratters, so why does it matter ?".
---
Goons will then spin saying "we can make that money faster than you", which is true. Everybody will then say "we won" and we go back to 1 year before the next invasion. Or goons decide to follow us everywhere we go and annihilate us, which is a good option for neither side.
---
North cannot win the war on their home battlefield just because of sheer numbers, and everyone knows it. Goons needs a sworn enemy so they come every year to spin about beating them and goes back to mining.
---
&gt; Especially in terms of PvE there is a lot of setup and effort involved for many people so evaccing is at least a major pita for PanFam
---
i dunno man
---
my pve setup consists of two rorqs (equipped with jump drives and capable of docking in npc stations), four mercoxit miners (which i can put in the rorqs), and five vnis which i'm perfectly comfortable asset safetying
---
not sure what setup you're referring to
---
&gt;deny goon fleet ops virtually all content except for structure grinds so in the end it's a loss-loss. Which in turn is a loss for the Imperium members since they invaded and were promised content
---
gentle reminder that goons enjoy unopposed structure bashes. many older goons will have fond memories of dbrb leading siegefleet stealth bomber structure bash fleets for hours on end without fighting anyone and in fact actively running from anyone who came to stop them
---
Wew a ceptor is cheating, I've done 2 successful laps around the outer edges of the map in a propless Thrasher. And not spamming dscan to find offline poses, unanchored citadels, geckos and shit is just a criminal waste.  
---
Still though, amazing effort &lt;3
---
Koolaid of Mittani's speech.
---
I kind of remember him saying we said they were bad and couldn't beat anyone. Nobody in the north think like that, we are sufficiently smart to know who is winning right now.
---
But whatever floats the spin more, amirite ?
---
I know right, memory is such a funny thing, this one time I forgot how it feels to be loved.
---
Removing skill extractors from the shop might help
---
Do the maths yourself! All the resources are out there :)
---
Undocked and afk, what a good way to die :D
---
2 titan kills in 1 bombers bar fleet, I think I ripped my pants with that erection I got
---
Dunno why this guy got downvoted. TDF allow alphas in battleships.
---
Outside of Mittani's spin though, who bitched again ?
---
Everyone in the North knows how strong goons are in reality, and we assume this position. Anything else is spin invented by goon leadership to justify an Nth war against NCPL to fulfill the yearly invasion calendar.
---
Gotta bring morale to the linemembers about bashing undefended structures.
---
Olmeca pulls so much stuff from his arse, he's like the magician hat of bullshit
---
It's your problem!
---
Fix your PC, fix access rights for the game relevant folders
---
Always install games in a separate folder, never in the structure beneath programs
---
Motivating people with a "they said means things about us, let's boot them from where they live". Right.
---
I got just over a month for it =p
---
gotta scoop that citadel baby.
---
BUT MY DELVE TIME UNITS!!@!1
---
I though I was going to have it because of 5 days of vacations, then the car broke down half way and I was stuck for 4 days instead, and missed the fucking 1M by one fucking day.
---
&gt;842mil for 10 hours of work isn't too bad for a Solo player,
---
It's definitely not good, either. I timed myself in a C3 site last night and it took 10min. That's 45m in blue loot. I don't usually do that though, you'll usually find me ninja huffing gas, which makes between 50-150m an hour, but it's mostly afk since I don't care if my 10mil venture gets blown up.
---
&gt;Risky activities like C6 or Null-Sec ratting.
---
Running C6 sites with multiple dreads or RR BSs is a hell of a lot different than null sec ratting. Null Sec ratting is pretty damn safe and makes 15-25m every 20min.
---
pretty sure your skill u renters at this point kid
---
Oh god, what a lack of responsability! How can Goons trust someone like him? It's not like there is a mechanic that allows you to jump between your home's staging and deployment's one in an instant!
---
/s
---
two counter examples
---
1. the black legion move op: "okay everybody insure your dreads, undock, and warp to xxx... okay now self destruct, we're buying new dreads at the destination"  
---
2. tishu move op: we had an alliance meeting, lex told us many things, and we logged on everything and packed up our suitcases for a long move... and then we took the gate from vestouve into txw and docked in txw
---
He did forget some of the pets, but w/e.
---
The actual fact is : NCPL didn't adapt soon enough to the industry meta.
---
Horde is.
---
Maybe in 3 years we could come close, but that's all.
---
You forgot:
---
Goon Losses: 30 something ships
---
NC Losses: Their entire abandoned home region, countless demoralized line members relegated to 'low-sec.' Lost clones, some of them more expensive than those goon ships, and a 15% premium in isk having to be paid by 90% of NC members having to get their shit out of asset safety. 
---
Added up like that, looks like Goons win eve yet again.
---
"Everyone else is off pissing about up north.  I got all these systems to myself.  Time for some turbokrabbing.
---
Ayyy, lemme just go make some tea while i leave these ships out in space."
---
The smart/pleb ratio from my encounters in Delve. 
---
In every encounter you can tell whether the opponent is smart or pleb. Gets drones stolen? = pleb. Shitfit? = pleb. Bad bait? = pleb. Salvages in super? = pleb.
---
Now imagine the amounts of encounters I had. Rorquals I stole from. Supers I attempted to kill. Etc. I think I'm in a better position to tell you your smart/pleb ratio.
---
Yeah, at max sp/hr its 15,4 days, that means its 20 days for a account you actually use though 
---
the real benefit is for high skilled toons that gets fuck all from injectors
---
[lemme get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgRs3Bca9tI)...
---
Thats EXACTLY what got me, i thought for sure id make that last day, but nope. RIP SP.
---
Same for me, really sad about it. The text up top tricked me into thinking I'd make it.
---
Big oooooff. Sorry for your loss ☹️
---
Excuse me, you aren't in character. You are fired from CODE.
---
rip
---
legit saw an expander rigged rorqual full of actual spod die this weekend
---
Exactly, I log in today and it says May 20th on the Neocom and yet I cannot claim the last prize. This is false advertising and distrust CCP even more now. The email says "by logging in on all the remaining days between now and 20 May." It's still the day of May 20th according to the game regardless of when DT is scheduled. What the hell?
---
The War that realy matters, is the Reddit one. XD
---
Yeah I'm familiar with the pheenomenon. I've been thru plenty of Goon deployments. Every Goon deployment feeds some ships in the beginning. Then the region dries up.
---
Right now there is a craze as lots of people moved in. We in DPCI do our best to ride the wave and coordinate everyone. But I'd rather peacetime Delve over wartime Delve. Our very specialty is operating under the umbrella. It gives us a challenge.  
---
I very much recognize Goons, Delve and the umbrella as my primary source of fun and content. While you folks judge us with respect to your "nullseccer" goals (according to which we are trying to kill your alliance, we are trying to supress your MER, etc) all we want is sustainably whale. I've never had a dream of a game with "no supercap umbrellas". My dream is a balanced game with a few more counterplays to umbrellas. In such a game, you'd still have lots of -more fun and content-friendly- options to defend your space (beginning using subcaps and jump gates). I'm sure you'd still be the alliance with the best defensive organization.
---
10/10 will welp in 1DQ for an Erebus again,  fixed your lack of overheated belief
---
Cool dude
---
Just worthless gold.... where is my latinum
---
something is amiss here.... I havnt missed a day and the last present dint show up.. CCCPed I guess. Not buying any devs beers in Sydney this weekend ;P
---
Khanid2Stain crew representing!
---
Hmm I only remember that raging nerd whose WOW-Account got deleted by his mother that tries to shove a TV-Remote up his arse ...
---
Yea.
---
I thought we had till the 20th. I have over 20 logins but didn't get all the rewards. Was I wrong?
---
\&gt;  I've never had a dream of a game with "no supercap umbrellas" 
---
Come now.  You've consistently whined about them.  Or was that Marshy.   I can't remember...
---
what culture.com
---
They gave the warning with so much time, than make me think he wanted something of what is happening or, something iam not seeing.
---
At least we got eachother, right? :(
---
Good grief.  They'll be unanchoring the planets next.
---
They bought their tickets, they knew what they were getting into.  I say, let em krab.
---
That's a bit rude tbf.
---
Even though I'm on the opposite side, I have a fair amount of respect for Karmafleet. They are creating a growth platform for new players coming to the game, and Merkelchen is pretty chill and looks after his dudes.
---
You're not wrong.
---
And as soon as we come home you can bet all these smug posts will dry up as everyone runs away with their tail tucked.
---
I did. But people can have more nuanced views than "yes umbrella" or "no umbrella". It is currently out of balance. I asked for a few counterplays. Never asked for "no supercap umbrella".
---
I've had major problems with crashing clients after transferring the eve client to a new SSD.
---
Someone suggested to wipe all eve files, including it's appdata folder (it tried without doing that but didn't help) and after a fresh install everything was perfect.
---
When you say fresh windows that probably doesn't help you directly unless you send the eve folder around/used a pre-existing version from storage you didn't format for the clean windows install.
---
TL:DR: It could be an error in your system.
---
Just to clarify, I wasn't pointing this solely at NC. - I was also including Pandemic Legion and Pandemic Horde (The latter there who do most of the hurfing about seal clubbing). 
---
Honestly the people who get caught and die in Delve get laughed at for being pretty dumb when it is well advertised the coaltion is gone on deployment and that there is no umbrella to save them.  
---
I've been playing eve since 2006 - I have only been a GSF line member for the last.. 3 years so I have seen a couple of wars and honestly I haven't actively deployed on this one because I know what is going to happen.  
---
The hurf blurf comes from both sides, its all part of war - and yes GSF is a huge blob these days with a massive Super Capital force, which I will agree is pretty much unrivaled and it would be pretty pointless for anyone to try stand up to that.
---
I dont think the problem is GSF or the Imperium, the super capital proliferation that has started since the citadels patch has caused quite alot of problems, no one wants to risk all their big toys in a slug fest (There have been a few big battles, although not on the scale of previous) - and this includes GSF, thats why when its a deployment its a full force show to scare people - and this has of course a negative effect.
---
Currently? 0 hours each week, but i check the sub almost daily, lol.
---
Do you even lift, bro?
---
I sort of doubt it is 0.. gotta be at least one mixed in there.
---
I'm not officially classified as a "Texan" (just moved to TX in 2018), but I am back in New Eden (after a four year hiatus). I live in the Rio Grande Valley.
---
Yeah one of my accounts missed the SP because I thought today counted as well :(
---
Vienna was sieged 60 days 15 to 1. Until the winged hussars arrived.
---
Go play Sabaton. You won't win the War, but listen Sabaton is always the right choice. XD
---
Bots already get the SP they needed from the friend referral system. They should just make that 750k sp standard for everyone.
---
Hmm ok, thanks for the Info!
---
Sorry fam https://i.imgur.com/vr0AI2x.png
---
Very risky tho.
---
Actually, if you listen to the SOTG, that isn't what Mittani said at all.  He blatantly said that there is no real narrative to this war... Goons are simply deploying to glass the region and increase their overall lead over the rest of the galaxy.
---
alright, but make it fast, and sexy. And after it's all over, you say "oooh what a lovely tea party"
---
May be better off googling how to delete someone else IRL (ingame) tbh.

Tier 4 pet talks about fighting own fights.

Don't worry, it'll still be offered and available for us just marketed to them.

Does that make good money? Never been in it.
---
Lol I laugh every time I see this copy-paste.
---
Why?
---
Just why?
---
Only an alpha lmao but maybe
---
Well how times change, now PanFam does to you what you did to them in WWB ... staying docked and spinning on reddit. You Sov-Null-Mongs are all the same ... you both ridicoulous koolaid-zippin narrative spergs ... ...
---
What’s the price to get into? And output do you know?
---
Two different issues, but both bad and somewhat intertwined.
---
Surprised at you not including the jumpin' you had on our 100 man fleet, where we didn't bubble you :joy:
---
We're pretty fat and happy.
---
Haha, I've been running T1s with two of us in kestrels. Interesting fit, we've been running mwds and light missiles for kiting. I'll have to play around with it.
---
Only in the mornings before work. 
---
Which this morning was a dumb idea. My knee was feeling a bit stiff this morning. Now it is being a bit of a bitch and is complaining if I twist a little. We'll see how it holds up tonight.
---
The praxii are about 120m each including fit, do a site together in about 10m and each site pays 40-45m split 2 ways
---
Fc what are outliers
---
What part of "the untouchables would join pandemic horde" am I failing to convey? They'd still be part of the coalition, but separated so as to maintain the weird barrier that NCdot and PL seem to need to function. Is this really so jarring of a concept?
---
It would have been trivial to outrecruit us, in the past. Public opinion of us was the lowest it could possibly be after 2016. Seizing that and actually playing the game would have cemented power. Instead, NCdot and PL figured it would be better to try and continue to coast.
---
Hm awesome is that with salvage? Risky but might be worth.
---
1 / 2 hours a day.
---
Sure, but while you are rebuilding, goons are increasing their economic advantage.
---
Even if they don't come back down, how many systems do you think you could take in delve? How many structures do you think you could actually burn?
---
What you can do in Delve isn't even a fraction of something they find painful.  They are going to burn down every planetary infrastructure thing (the name is escaping me at the moment).  When your infrastructure unanchors, the rigs are lost... that in and of itself will be the worst thing to replace.
---
The structures you don't pull will be burned.
---
In a month or two, goons will go back home and will pick up right where they left off.
---
I am pretty sure we are in the endgame now, and no one came up with &gt;!time travel.!&lt;
---
Any good loots from t1? I just ran one, got maybe 8 mil. I do seem to remember getting some expensive skillbooks, but maybe that was t2.
---
all the Delve-PvE-Honey must have stickied your eyes ... I hate both of you (ingame) but as a goon stating PL is inactive in PvP is top notch hypocrisy ....
---
The kills in Delve will probably dry up eventually.
---
Even the most brain dead krabs will lose enough stuff to just stop eventually, or maybe ask someone else what is going on.  
---
Will be interesting to see what happens to the narrative then.
---
Wasn't it possible to destroy stargates at some point? I feel like I heard a story about Band of Brothers destroying the stargates into Delve every day (as they'd respawn at downtime) until CCP patched it. Is that true?
---
I donno - I mean there are a lot of ways to measure a war in a game.  Isk is one.  Strategic advantage is another.  Possession of (or denial of) territory is another.
---
See here's the thing - we were all told to spool down the rorqs and dock up the ratters.  That Delve would be increasingly dangerous.  That's a no-brainer during a deployment, right?  But some krabs can't help themselves - and they pay the price.
---
And who does it hurt really?  They will lose money to replace their ships, someone else will make money by providing those ships.  Nothing of value truly lost - money shifts hands, but it all stays within the alliance.
---
So yeah, we'll go on the warpath.  NC/PL can't win, but it won't stop them from shitposting about it.  We can't lose, but it won't stop us from shitposting.  And everyone gets content out of it.  I mean, what would you prefer - that everyone just sit around and go mining and there be no content?
---
Not the first time I've seen that happen
---
Okay, we aren't in total agreement. You think, weirdly, that public doxxing is okay, but kicking people for shit that borders on racist/nationalist bullshit is bad. 
---
Fair enough.
---
To be successful the Fabian strategy has to meet a certain standard. 
---
The north will have to demoralize the invading force....usually through breaking up supply with small skirmishes. 
---
Do you think the Fabian strategy would have been considered successful if all of Italy burned?
---
She Hannibaled my Fabian!

---
So you are telling me you go to the gym for about 3 hours per day?
---
As a fellow gym goer somehow I don’t believe it.
---
Even with 7 training sessions around 1-1,5h there’s no way you can spend 20hours per week at the gym unless you do cardio and stretching for 2 hours atop your normal training
---
That has to  have been the idea right? 
---
This is made-you-form writ large. "Made you unachor and move to lowsec" :p
---
Yep, same for bumping.          
---
I know that some people managed to bump in a gate near gunned pos, as the moon was very close to gate.

Upvoted for providing the victims side of story and calling out your own mistakes. 
---
At least this was a warqual fit and you weren't just moving a mining rorqual.
---
The real difficulty is changing all my contacts in delve to only goons and pets red. Snuffed gets a lovely shade of orange for now.
---
He surrounds himself with competent people, then lets them run things.
---
You say that he doesn't play the game, I would say he lets his directors do their job.
---
He knows what he doesn't know.  His job is overarching strategy and long term goals.  His directors take that vision and make it a reality.
---
Saying he doesn't play isn't really correct, saying he doesn't know what is going on is correct, but that is because that isn't his job.
---
NO

T2 on a rorq?  Gross it deserved to die.

NO I CAN STOP WHENEVER I WANT!!!!!

Well with goons deploying what is the safest area for NC. this days?

If we wanted content we'd just stay home.

We're not going north for content.

Intact armor plates at 6mil + a pop

Erm 8 hours a day :( prob a few more on my days off from work, shit writing that down it looks bad
---
That is what divides the super-piloting pleb from today (that has no clue about anything) from people that actually know how to Super outside of Havens, kindergarden move ops and and Citadels.
---
Was not so much talking about individual miners or ratters and thinking more of industrial backbones, PI and those things. "PvE" was prolly to wide.
---
Yeah, but readers are from the whole world you know. Try to adjust to the worlds meta. XD
---
so many seem to have the same ‚problem‘ and want to blame CCP. as if you only missed one day. c‘mon. you had 20 days for 16 logins. so you have already missed 3 logins prior to your last. there was more than enough prep time with the announcement weeks in advance. totally 100% your own fault. no one else to blame
---
Bit of a reach over some hyperbole but ok.
---
planned to release as an Nintendo DS exclusive.
---
Your main counterplay is how you choose your targets, because the following:
---
* Not on coms
---
* Out of range
---
* No cyno
---
* No cyno fuel
---
* Cyno in wrong fleet
---
* Inhib onlined
---
* Poorly fit
---
, are all potentially unsavable by the umbrella, especially if two or more on that list are true.  I mean if you're asking for counterplay, why can't the victims ask for counter-counter play?  You see how this goes.  Just pick off the people who can't follow instructions.  There are lots of them in Delve. Your job is to find them.
---
I hope that for every citadel that is burned in the north, 2 or 3 dumb supers or titans die in delve. 
---
I actually like that panfam and friends are fighting it this way. In a war of attrition, it matters how much you burn. Titans, supers, and rorquals in delve don't have a reinforcement timer. It will also burn out the theta squad eventually. I just hope that they can do enough damage to have a true impact.
---
I agree but it was told until 20 may so its still 20. Who is wrong? If its untill DT they should write until 20 may DT. Technicaly its until 20.05.19 23:59? Am i wrong?
---
15h a week. On discord all day though so not sure.
---
I think that was on SISI.  The bug/issue never made it to Tranq.
---
No Tasti was the HQ. The Incursion was closed after downtime. We already confirmed this straight away that we got the cyno bug. 
---
The person lighting a cyno probably did it outside the constellation without realising, because the constellation geography is pretty dumb. My guess it was lit in Messoya. Which despite the way it lays very close to Tasti, it is in fact in the other constellation.  [http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/The\_Forge/Mivora](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/The_Forge/Mivora)

It was a thing years go.     
---
Before my times, but i know people who did this kind of stuff.
---
When I'm subbed I play probably 4-5hrs after work every night, more on weekends. Then get burned out after 3-4 months and take 3-4 months off and repeat the cycle.
---
The subreddit is a constant tho.
---
Look. I support the North in this War... But, what you did and said about UnSpoken was pure shit.
---
They are a LOT more outnumbered and outgunned than you. And they made their stand.
---
NC lacks of blue when they need it, because that kind of shit. Even, when almost everyone in EvE want a limit on GSF power.
---
NC has been the best propaganda agent for Goons for long time actually.
---
i see that i touched something deeply hidden and probably self denied  ...
---
Eve and the gym are the only hobbies I have, it's the only thing I can really compare it to in order to assess if I'm addicted or not. Since it's the hobby I spend least time on, I don't think I'm addicted.
---
We were told to die quietly
---
Because the shitposting is the most fun part of the war :D
---
hoped for a chance to post a bit ... damn you
---
I lift on weekdays before work, I grapple after work most days and on weekends. Some Sundays I do a yoga class if I can be arsed.
---
That's a good haul I'd say, and explo is one of those EVE things that -- at least for me -- are tough to completely burn out on. It will never not be thrilling to hack cans in wormhole space, never knowing if you're being watched. 
---
I've only ever done it with a full fleet, but I imagine C6 ratting can be a bit tricky solo without considerable infrastructure, skills and ISK. If you're looking for a place to start that will get you good ISK per hour, start in a C3. A passive Gila can get you through the easier combat anoms, and a non-blingy Rattlesnake can tank even the more difficult sigs. 
---
You'll still want to verify that the C3 isn't inhabited, and keep an eye on the static and for any new sigs that might be new connections, but once you get used to it you can run them at a decent clip. 
---
The sigs dry up, of course, so you'll either need to be on the hunt for a new uninhabited C3 or just seed the system and come back in a week when the sites have respawned.
---
Now's a better time than ever for stain gates
---
Wait do you think NC will hide in Stain?
---
and goons don't? Ok, noted.
---
If they undock, maybe
---
isk destroyed is isk destroyed, nobody gives a fuck what kind of asset it is.
---
hope goons have fun with their 500+ titan blob in the north that most likely won't get a single fight during their "campaign".
---
Ah, there's that juicy, bitter-vet gatekeeping
---
until you start seeing those asset safety bills start coming in, proof needed that everyone is doing that.
---
I'll wait
---
Same thing, but I was onto this early, 2 of my four accounts were a day behind, and I play every day,they have not responded to my request for over a week
---
As the Dictor that caught you and the Sin. It was a shame we didn't get yah'. 
---
I must admit though, that Sin has 16k ehp and when I saw the torps coming towards me I did shit my pants a bit :)
---
because he's the fucking draken thats how
---
i like this kill and this title :=)
---
NGDS (Not Goons Dont Shoot) should become a thing
---
believe whatevery you want, I wish every goon loads of fun while structure bashing through the north with their blob, hope they won't get bored ;-)
---
4-6 hours a week if i can get away with it.
---
Thanks for the insight, interesting :)
---
&gt;At least this was a warqual fit and you weren't just moving a mining rorqual.
---
He was the phoenix...
---
Ahh NC. When they tried to keep their Provi holdings all those years ago they didn't realize you had to anchor \*and\* online SBUs.....then tried to get us banned for hacking when we ninja'd them.
---
Makes more sense.
---
I train BJJ as well but 20 hours still seems kinda excessive
---
Tbh i am truly wondering if sole reason for NC to unchanchor all this stuff is just to force members to undock.
---
"NC dock forced to undock to move docking bays"
---
Thanks for the info as well, I’ve been picking up on stuff here and there on reddit to figure out what’s actually going on :)
---
Everything is based on DT now
---
Just stating the current game meta, tabbed out multiboxing with "automatted" intel is the only way to win EVE atm.
---
The same things happens with extractors. I wish I knew why people did that. I did a post yesterday but no one had an answer.
---
you can active cloak than mvd. just try this on nearest gate
---
Need more coffee. Apparently I cant read this morning.
---
&gt; &gt; Your main counterplay is how you choose your targets, because the following:
---
I never said we never kill people under the umbrella. Given your list, it boils down to the degree of brain-deadery you have exhibit to die in Delve. As of right now, it's too high. As a result, only 3% of all farm converts to killmails. I argue the buffs to whaling should be buffed until this ratio is around 15%s. 
---
&gt; why can't the victims ask for counter-counter play?
---
Because the risk/reward balance is inherent to the very core of this game. It's even advertised in many trailers. How it works is that there is less risky space with less reward and more risky space with more reward. A great part of the risk in risky space is dying to other players. So Eve uses the mechanic to create motivations for people to take risks, and then occasionally die. When they die, they become a source of fun and a reason to keep subscribing for people killing them. Every Rorqual killmail is a reason for people to play for a week or more for tens, or potentially hundreds of people to keep playing this game. That includes you. Goons too have whaling SIGs.
---
In past 3 years the risk/reward balance was tipped too far to the safer side particularly in umbrella regions. Mainly due to CCP wanting to milk the Rorqual multiboxing craze as a short term income/stats buff. First the whaling content reduced. Due to umbrella mechanics (the motivation to live under the same region as tens of thousands of characters), huge unbreakable blue donuts have emerged. Which meant no real wars (e.g. you are going to a "war" right now but nobody will fight you - because you have twice the amount of titans and can replace them three times faster). PLEX prices increased. Capital prices tanked, proliferating capitals, invalidating non-capital playstyles. Lots of other systemic and economic issues hit the game. As a result of all these lots of people left the game, and the game became stagnant. 
---
So yes. I can argue for a riskier nullsec and counterplays to umbrellas. You can't argue for a safer nullsec.
---
It's not that much time to spend on a hobby.
---
Especially once you strip out the hours for lifting, that leaves 15 or less, and it only approaches 15 on a busy week when I stay and do extra rounds with some of the competitors or there's a seminar etc.
---
As I said in my original post, it's under 20, not 20 exactly.
---
May not be to your liking, [but here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=14Mnil9C7SexHzb4_u34pTlDe6EoADhss)
---
It's something I've self maintained over the years to suit my needs and it works pretty well. Nothing against the overview packs that exist but they are too bloated for my liking.
---
Make sure to back up your overview settings first before importing mine, just in case you don't like it
---
&gt; After the fight I realized comms were muted and deafened. I am one big idiot.
---
Yeah the amount of times I realize like an hour later that my mic is muted/unpluged and people are not just ignoring me. The funniest is if you ask a question and someone says something that could be an answer so you don't know you are muted. lol
---
It can for sure.  There are guides out there for how to maximize isk earned in fw.
---
Imo this shouldn't just be rip sp. Everything they showed their global audience said may 20. They know thier community is global and using vague timezone dates to skip out on giving daily rewards is insanely crappy. I don't feel like we as a community should just accept this as rip free sp. This should be an outrage, if they really are going the way of pearl abyss and giving daily log in rewards the very least they could do is atleast allow everyone the chance to get the big final reward, without timezone locking it from over half thier community
---
Also, thank the gods. I have been sitting on a number of super hulls I have been buying since they started selling routinely for &gt;10b. Now there might actually be enough demand for them for me to actually flip them for some profit.
---
&gt; As a result, only 3% of all farm converts to killmails.
---
It doesn't matter.  The more dangerous you make it, the fewer people will undock expensive things.  Also note the sleight of hand here.  3% to 15%.  Don't use percentages.  If you up your percentage to 15%, op success?  No.  Because the total number of targets has fallen 90%.  Your 15% is lower than the 3% of the higher number of people in space.
---
There are hard limits to the amount you can destroy.
---
But both would lead to a random wormhole instead due to a bug the developers can't just fix even though they promised in return for approving their designs.
---
There is a big difference. If you knew there was a titan in a system, you could destroy the pos and he would have no safe harbor besides jumping out. Now, dock up your titan in the local keepstar and never worry about losing it. It just goes into an asset safety hangar.
---
Yeah I’m setting up space popcorn stations around delve and the north..
---
Demotion to 24th best FC when?
---
What would you know about it in your l33t wormholes?
---
No.....just no!!!
---
Instead for me it's like if it's my birthday, got the sp, also bought a large skill injector before 5kk SP and today a dude gave me 5b worth of stuff because he's quitting. Life's been good for me today..
---
I had finals during the first part and thought the same so I figured I was safe to put finals first
---
It's different to Darwinism culture, which is the occasional smartbombing gatecamp in the pipe, and continual attempts to take sov in Querious just to give yourselves something to do other than low-sec relic sites, yes.
---
&gt; saying he doesn't know what is going on is correct
---
Eh, I'm pretty sure he knows what's going on!
---
I'll second what everyone else said about Abyssal stuff. Depending on the tier it's better ISK than most k-space ratting, more thrilling than running the same incursions ad infinitum and there's a real risk of your ship and your pod dying. That last one doesn't sound like a plus I know but it makes surviving much more satisfying. 
---
If you're interested in dabbling in PVP, try out one of the NPSI groups like Spectre Fleet or Bombers Bar.
---
Unless the enemy has studied his Agrippa...
---
...which I have.
---
Was it bumped or just stupid and drifted out of teether?
---
I'm really pretty pissed about this. I resubscribed 2 accounts for this and I feel ripped off.
---
It's funny that the screenshot shows, "2 hours left of campaign."
---
You would figure that would mean there's 2 hours left to claim the prize.
---
No but rmting all that sweet tax isk ... also if not poor Mittani then, quitting his RL Job for a few cups coffee XD
---
Finally PI will be in place that it should be - mobile
---
Just his maths?
---
YYYY-MM-DD is the only logical choice:
---
* the order goes from most significant to least significant left to right, like numbers are written
---
* confusion over month and day of month is prevented
---
* standard string sorting will sort by date also, no date parsing required (very useful for file names)
---
* ISO 8601
---
So, When I'm not playing EvE, I'm generally thinking about playing EvE especially during wars or a specific Op, if that counts, then I can pretty much say 4 hours after work + intermittently over 6-8 hours during the rest of the day.
---
I didn't "forget". It's 5/20 here and in Iceland, and I have no damn skillpoints. Pretty mad right now.
---
what
---
this didnt show up for me... wtf.
---
Jokes aside, hope its nothing serious mate.
---
I'm pretty sure you mean Casino War , WWBee is some pubbie shit they came up with misdirecting it was about the illegal gambling website going on
---
Have goons done anything this war besides die in their own home ?
---
OP is angry he didn't just get to log in 16 days into the event and just get his 1m sp.
---
its only sp just buy a few injectors there cheap
---
What mistake?
---
It's prob nullsec people salty at a higher income outside div space that doesn't feed taxes to an overlord and doesn't have bots either
---
 Boy. In my days i got denied for being a Jew who bombed children in Palestine.
---
Better level up.
---
It'll be fine, I'll just have to go easy on it. Thanks.
---
If this is actually a mobile client for EVE and not a separate game that would be pretty cool. No idea what to make it of this from the footage alone, though.
---
Did anyone else notice that it went from 2 days left to claim prizes to under 24 hours on the last day?  This fucked me over, and I'm not happy.
---
I do not care. It always has been and always will be WWBee to me.
---
Can someone make a Real Money stimated cost of that numbers?
---
If that's the case submit a support ticket so they can sort it
---
!remindeme 3 months
---
I honestly would have worried more about this if there were 18 months in a year. It's extremely obvious regional format unless you're a complete spodbrain.
---
Late AAR: Titan was spotted drifting off the Keepstar by Delve Honey Hunters - so we started moving people into position and waited until he was orange/red on the tether range, then we contacted other groups around the area (Bombersbar, VOLTA and others) etc for support.
---
After 10-15 minutes it drifted out of tether range, sabres were warped into Keepstar to bubble the Erebus, cyno went up and in came the support. 
---
2-3 minutes later Keepstar doomsday'd just as friendly dreads were cyno'd in, but only a few bombers died to it lol.
---
It took Goons a good while to undock caps/supers and a jackdaw fleet from the keepstar, and so we sent down a bubbler to bubble the undock...but by then the Erebus was hitting structure and was soon to be laying on the front door dead.
---
Good fight Goons, already replaced etc - and thanks to those who answered our call, first Titan in their home system, and third in Delve this year.
---
PS: Dat Lif  ;)
---
Imagine if players could build stargates to systems, think of them conquering jove space via stargates!
---
They gave people 2 extra days slack time, and you still fucked it up.
---
Get over it, and move on.
---
The period after downtime on the 20th rolls into the 21st. You're right that the 20th is up until midnight, but it's not the right answer ccp were looking for.
---
Almost like there are times when risk is low and times when risk is high and these are well known ahead of time.
---
Take risks while we're deployed and you own your fate.  
---
Do everything right while we're not deployed or actively on a strat op and there's a damn good chance you'll get saved.  That's true for any alliance.
---
I used to be addicted but ccps business decisions over the years have sobered me up and I'm now an alpha pilot waiting for a change of direction or the company to fold and allow the players to maintain the servet
---
&gt; Let's just say that even the players that got their final prize during the eve 16th anniversary got missleaded to think that it was from the 2nd to the 20th of May.
---
I got all login prizes, haven't had any problems with the whole system, except the annoyance from people who complain that they missed some prize by x minutes/hours/days/months/years.
---
Log in, collect prizes, move on.
---
Haha you expected ccp to be competent? That was your first mistake.
---
You have to be on grid for the reconnect to lost drones button to work.
---
Well, I find it interesting that you assume all of that about me, considering my six omega accounts since I started playing Fall 2016 have never been plexed. I'll also grab the $100 plex package occasionally when plex is high and I have to work a couple hours overtime on Saturdays. So I, a 3yr player, spending ~$1000/yr(12mo subs, 6 accounts + plex splurges) am the cancer killing this game? Lolk, kindly eat an entire bag of dicks
---
On the offhand chance you're basing your judgment off of a flair, you should know that subscribing to stereotypes has the tendency to make you look like an uneducated monkey
---
Must be better after it's broken in
---
You sound like a loser
---
Uh, no... Every new feature would have to be reduced to work also on a mobile touchscreen and other limitations a mobile game has.
---
It definitely will be a stand allone universe. They showed a demo at last fanfest called "Eve echoes": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kw6BcQtszj0&amp;t=1s
---
A felt cushion one of my employes made today. Colors are not quite right, but i thought i share anyways
---
Add me to the tricked in to omega for the same thing. Would have gotten the SP today..
---
Keep up the good work T!  Even if I am not near Thera I always tune in.
---
&gt; Nobody's going to undock to be blown up by you after a while.
---
I can understand you feel entitled to that safety as you lived under it for so long, and that it feels like you wouldn't undock if you lost more ships. 
---
But think of it this way. If everyone in nullsec statistically lost at least 15% of their income, would they stop farming? Perhaps you can argue they might go to hisec, lowsec, or wormholes. But that's still a comparative issue. If 15% rate is achieved, CCP can also buff nullsec income adequately. Such that it wouldn't even be an overall loss for the nullseccer. You used to make 3b in 10 hours of Nyx farming, and lose 90m of it. Now you can make 4b in 10 hours, and lose 600m of it. You would still be ISK positive.
---
CCP always nerfed nullsec yield and ISK to address the economic problems. What it should have done was to increase the risk, and then buff the reward accordingly if needed.
---
Currently, you do know there will be a peacetime with 3% risk, so you would dock in risky periods. But what if it was the norm? Why are people not docking when they lose 3%, why are they docking when they lose 15%? By your logic, why are people joining corporations which have 10% tax to begin with? 
---
The answer: The tax doesn't matter as long as the income is good compared to other places in Eve.
---
See, this is simply a taxation problem. If you tax 90% of your country's income, then you will kill all the economic activity (analogous with people docking). If you tax 3%, then you won't be able to sustain the system (analogous to Eve ecosystem dying). Somewhere in-between (15% as I argue), is the optimal taxation spot.
---
I am a little bit bitchy because i took some days off counting on those dates... :(
---
Wat?

Yeah I figured as much. I just want to be able to update PI and market orders and Industry jobs from my phone. :(

And this is why you don't post while on spod

I don't understand people that are so into mining when there is already a ton of other activities that earn you 10 times within the same a mount of work. Just go exploring and buy minerals with the money. Or do FW with an alpha pilot and make 100m an hour, then buy all the minerals you want.
---
Felt hurricane, might delete later
---
Well I'm not just accepting it. Cancelled the accounts. Thought I'd come back to Eve after some time off. This was the enticement to do so and resub two accounts. 
---
But after this? Nah. No thanks.
---
A big 'Fuck You' from CCP. 
---
"There's no need to log in consecutively...." \*wink wink\*
---
I like when people take advantage of concentrated numbers in different areas of space. The strategy comes out and only the most experienced willing to risk their ships will come out on top.
---
It's Ok. It's Eve. Paty-to-win now. Just buy 2M SP and say 'Fuck You CCP! and Fuck You players!'

Mar5meca, your dream is a game where input broadcasting is encouraged, where you can throw your Russia wealth at the game and win, and where basic human interaction has been nerfed so your alt army can win eve.
---
They are *literally* the same person.
---
So you are saying you'd do it differently if you were in the same situation?
---
Missed it by 30 mins. I know the feeling.
---
He is probably just counting the ones that still can't follow basic instructions on excavators after a year of natural selection. Not the ones who can't follow primaries or broadcast on time.
---
anyone who don't want their enemy feed for years until they become a super power block that will make any war one sided ?
---
So you are saying, ingame its the 21st of May?
---
People marry people they've met on the internet.  It's a thing that happens...
---
just not like this bullshit story.
---
&gt;isk destroyed is isk destroyed, nobody gives a fuck what kind of asset it is.
---
So when Goons will burn every single keepstar and sotiyo the north own you won't be one of those guy (like we had last war) "mimimimi CCP do something goons are too powerful, nerf rorq, nerf super, delet goons" ?
---
Related/unrelated note. I remember when having a dedicated alt with Starbase Control (or whatever the fuck it was) to 5 was amazing. POS gunning was a legit fun thing to do.
---
Yeah... I would of made if but I was a groomsman in seeding for a buddy... so I lost an entire day cause I couldn't log on... I thought I might make it. RIP SP
---
&gt; throw your Russia wealth
---
Lol what? And people call me tinfoil hat.
---
&gt; it feels like you wouldn't undock if you lost more ships. 
---
It's like you have no mental model of how other people think Olmeca.  I'm not feeding your gameplay experience.  You can fuck off with that.  The only place I want my super to die is on a keepstar pointing an enemy Titan.  I no longer rat in my Nyx now because the NSA changes made it too dangerous, even with the umbrella.  
---
As I said, psychology 101.  No, I'm not giving you fun.  Most other people won't want to either.  The number of targets you have will decrease.  Just look at what happens with cloaky campers in systems and you can see this.  If it wasn't effective nobody would bother doing it.
---
that is terrible. even though it was clearly marked on redeeming popup what and when? Poor you, life is so hard...
---
&gt;Supers I attempted to kill
---
A rare admission by Mar5meca of his utter failure at killing things that shoot back. You should stick to booshing.
---
you could redeem prizes up til downtime on the 20th.  They didn't specify what time of day on the 20th
---
They are?
---
Pretty much, usually between 6-12 million for T1 sites, although you do sometimes get the destroyer skill books, but they're pretty rare.
---
Yup same!
---
Yeah, so I'm just going to ignore your system and keep renting out of game.  What incentive are you supposedly offering me to do otherwise?
---
Are you going to also ban out of game agreements?  Good luck with that.
---
&gt; a group that has less concern/attachment to its space
---
"didn't want that space anyway"?
---
and then CCP would fucked up by releasing a "gate jammer"

there will be more events dw

No I'm saying that every event for at least the last year or 2 has ended at DT when they have to reset the whole server

I see some strategic value in tcus if they have that 300% increase to fuel consumption for hostile structures.
---
Do you honestly think that everyone would permanently stop krabbing if super umbrellas were gone? If they stop krabbing now, it will be because they know it's only for a short time... If super umbrellas were permanently nerfed, I doubt all the krabs would just give up on making ISK.
---
These are screenshots from the footage I got. I was not part of the BB fleet so just aligned out and looked at the spectacle while talking mad shit on comms.
---
So fly the ships that occasionally allow some degree of skill to come into their use rather then "click jump, F1, run cap injectors while approaching a titan? titans are really shitty end game content design. It's basically just a battleship with additional penis compensation.
---
Probs a good 20 h
---
Multi-dollar empire 101.
---
Can't you just create a jump gate network from Stain to high sec?
---
Turn off your computer, open the trapdoors of your basement and let sun and air in. seems you really need it lol
---
Even on mobile CCP doesn't stack the guns.
---
Click on the link, I wrote the AAR below the pictures.
---
It'll be just like it was when I lived in Providence.  Anything close in intel or any cloaky camper in system and you dock up your krabbing ships and keep them docked until they've gone.  Right now in Delve, most Rorqs and Supers don't dock up.  You have literally 5 x more targets in space because of the super umbrella.
---
I saw this myself the NGSA in Dek.  Literally turned the place into a wasteland with cloaky campers.  No viable umbrella = No targets.
---
This was actually covered at fanfest last year, I think. It's a separate client, separate universe, I don't know if it's mobile only or not, but iirc it is. I'd 100% give it a try, myself. Here's the trailer on CCP's youtube channel.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kw6BcQtszj0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kw6BcQtszj0)
---
If I resign my account today that claimed every day then do I still get the omega bonus or did I miss that chance?
---
Eve was like heroin for a while.. The last 5 years it's become a conglomerate of Smarties dust, dog-shit and AIDS... covered in full-spectrum Autism.
---
Be a space pirate take everything give nothing back.
---
Justice demands retribution!
---
To be fair, I'd probably lose loads of them to him if I had a rorq.
---
Mining isn't interesting enough to keep me at the keyboard. I'd be constantly doing other shit in range of the pc so I could hear the empty asteroid and shield notifications.
---
I lose most of my vnis that way.
---
We can smug. The fact so many are saved in peacetime is an achievement in itself.

It was a blast man, comms it up like a Christmas tree with sound

I'm sure we will! It is going to be a blast! :)

You need to own sov to deploy a jump gate
---
Wouldn't be the first time Horde has moved...
---
Not even the first time Horde has moved because Goons came to evict them (see Cloud Ring: The Clever Girls campaign)
---
I always enjoyed moving to a new area... gets stale living in the same place too long.  That being said I do understand some people get really attached to the space they're living in and losing it is frustrating for them.
---
I'm in the same boat... window went from 2 days left on Saturday to less than 24 hours left on Sunday...
---
Confirming, read 2 - 20th May - assumed they meant when people actually play the game - ie. after work :D
---
Nonono, you have to stick to the plan laid out at the bbq. This summer goons kill NC, next summer they kill Horde, the year after that they betray and kill TEST. Then in 2022 INIT resets imperium and makes a last stand with unlikely allies HK.  Everyone quits EVE for lack of content and the servers shut down at the end of 2023. Mittens leads goons through the portal to the promised land of real life, where they all burst into flames.
---
Let the bodies hit the floor.
---
What I don't get, is how do they get unanchored, whilst never undocking?!!
---
We wanted that particular titan even less than you wanted all your unanchored structures and mods...
---
The serenity server often saw Titan battles even when one side was going to lose badly. They look like they have more fun
---
The times with playing multiple hours over night until the sunrise reminded me to go to bed are 10 years gone.
---
People in my Corp are at an avg. age of 35+, so usually EVE is just our chatroom about old Glory ;-) ... being happy if we manage to play at least 6-10 hrs/week. And it is less &amp; less fun in a Meta that shows players like us the stinky middle finger saying"LoLwut, 6-10 hrs a week, but without using all this time for mining you wont have alliance scale income anymore".
---
Oh sweet summer child...
---
Because minerals you mine yourself are free, amiright
---
Same here except I claimed the prize every day using a remote desktop app on my phone.
---
It's not a bad plan actually.
---
cant they just hurry up and kill us all already, so i have a good excuse to get rid of this addiction?
---
If this were a thing StainGuy would have been deleted a long time ago
---
But there’s four races. I’d rather them be able to fly one cruiser from their chosen race than not.  And maybe let the miners use a barge.
---
That's why I did it yesterday instead.
---
Maths
---
The botter problem is irrelevant IMO because they just skill inject. More sp would benefit people going for their 2-5th alts the most. Ppl confuse these players with the 20+ alt botter players. But the massive botters will always skill inject.
---
North unanchoring their whole region will simply be open for new groups to move in, with Goons allowing it to happen.
---
they got a ihub in pb today
---
Like re-introduce the alliance tournament with capitals?
---
thealphasguide.com
---
to pretend that EVERY super you drop on is 100% a kill is wrong. Olmeca does a fantastic job swatting supers, sometimes he fails. so what?
---
You should stick to not having enough super bots that Marshy and Olmeca killed like a dozen of them
---
This is a nice FUCK YOU from CCP. I'm not too upset since 1 mil SP is nothing when you have 150mil SP but still. Don't advertise until 20th when it's not inclusive...
---
Try and Finish the new player experience and then the starter carear Missions... if you can handle that garbage. You’ll like eve.
---
That helps :) I switch off my PC when I'm not home/using it for extended periods of time.
---
I just hate that everything is now based around log-in bonuses in a game that has the progression fleshed out to ne not reliant on logging in and playing all the time. I don't have the time for Eve that I had and invested 14 years ago. Fuck, I and eve are getting old. Though eve tends to look better as it ages. 😜
---
A week? 20-30 hours. In total? Roughly 3300.
---
Two days ago it stopped for me. Don't know why. One of my accounts didnt get the 1m sp.
---
THAT'S MY LINE
---
haha made you unanchor and come to our space and kill our krabs and burn delve
---
haha
---
Not everyone is a gullible cunt either, apparently.
---
I remember Brave explicitly not being MBC.  They'd "third party" or something.
---
What do you even do?
---
&gt; It's like you have no mental model of how other people think Olmeca.
---
If your entire argument is "people would dock if they lost a Rorqual per 500 hours of mining instead of per 1300 hours of mining", I'm comfortable stopping the discussion here as you are obviously ridiculous.
---
&gt; I'm not feeding your gameplay experience. You can fuck off with that. 
---
If you don't appreciate the risk/reward balance has always been an inherent part of Eve Online, you don't deserve to be taken seriously in balance discussions.
---
&gt; The only place I want my super to die is on a keepstar pointing an enemy Titan. 
---
You are free to not rat in it.
---
Fuck that.  It makes the word useless.
---
Make Literally Great Again.
---
This is what happens when 50% of the population is in a single coalition.
---
They will turbo blob, they will stagnate, they will unsub.
---
My best advice to goons that are feeling low hopes for their deployment, leave.
---
Take what you can and move out. You have undoubtedly amassed a wealth that most smaller alliances in the game cant come close to. You may be rusty when it comes to PVP, and people will farm you. However that is a teachable moment.
---
Learn how to survive on your own, stake a claim somewhere in eve. The only reason Goons, or really any large alliance has power, is people. Eve fundamentally is a N+1 game. dont give that entity its +1 if it means hell deployments to shoot a structure and then deploy back home to krab.
---
More North, to Jove Space :V
---
I planned all three accounts to hit the so today, guess that isn't happening when I log in.
---
I did, this is just another viewpoint from those who found it and contacted the groups to come in and drop - ie; **Honey Hunters**...who were surprisingly not mentioned anywhere.
---
lol no
---
I barely could care enough to motivate myself to get those login bonuses.
---
hell, you can have my bloody sp if i can get your vacation...
---
500MWD, Small Smartbomb Maller. it needs low-grade snakes.
---
The easiest way back to empire is through low class wormholes (C1-3). They are all assured a kspace static. If the choice is to splash the C4/5 or the 2/3, take the latter. Also only probe holes to 100%. You're looking for a route, not more loot.
---
dont use my lossmails, all of them are bad fits
---
Hehe XDDDDDDDD
---
Look for lower class wormholes. If you find a c1 c2 or c3 class you will likely have a lowsec or highsec static. If you find a C4 in null they sometimes have statics to c3's so you can follow the chain to lowsec/highsec.
---
Never try to use the gates into and out of nullsec.
---
TIL we're demoralized.
---
Couldnt you "forget" to log in for 3 or 4 days to begin?
---
Continuing the harassment in Delve at the beginning was the right play for NCPL.  They wouldn't have *killed* goons, but they might only be half the strength they are now.  That would still make them the largest economic powerhouse in EVE... but not by such a large margin.
---
The current state of the game has been entirely dictated by NCPL actions after WWB.
---
I feel the pain man, not everyone can do this.. it woulda made a huge differnce in my game play, but now.. I feel rather defeated because I'm not utterly spastic about the game.  Now my two  omegas I pay for out of pocket fell very insignificant if I can't login 5/7 days of the week.
---
I went to Prague to see the Joe Hisaishi concert, I've been waiting for a concert of his for about 3 years that was fairly close in Europe. So... no, not turning that experience in for anything. ☺️
---
Itt: goons have never seen a combat rorq and are shocked it doesn't have excavators.
---
Your problem is that you're reducing it to "lose x ships per y hours".  Fuck that.  Seriously.  I don't want to lose *any* ships, *ever*.  I mean if you want to be that fucking idiotic, why not just start a self-destruct countdown on every ship somebody buys that decrements by 1 every second they're undocked in it, exploding when it hits zero.  You can even have the fucking killmail because at that point nobody will give a shit about the game.  You'll be on the server by yourself.
---
Same, I missed out on my two omegas, by one last day.. I really thought I had one more day and was very excited for that.  Now, as I commented elsewhere in this thread, I just feel defeated.
---
1: Dying is apart of the game. Yes it sucks to lose ships but you can ALWAYS rebuild. No need to get salty and take the loss personally.
---
2: Try everything. A lot of new players seem to join, get stuck sitting in a venture mining away from hours on end and eventually burn out. Nothing wrong with mining if that's what you like to do, just make sure you do other things now and then.
---
3: EVE can be played solo but it's thousand times better with friends. There are lots of corps out there, once you've figured out what it is you like doing, find one in your timezone and enjoy building, blowing ship up, exploration, wormholes etc.. with a few buddies.
---
4: Don't be afraid to ask questions - https://www.reddit.com/r/evenewbies/

5: Have fun.

So at best we could get sov next to stain, and sov next to low, and chain it from there. Ah well, I tried /u/StainGuy
---
Damn, I was out Saturday and ill on Sunday. Completely forgot this.
---
"Lets attack legions of newbeans" - Goons 2019
---
&gt; They evicted goons, split their coalition, and camped them into a station in lowsec for over a month. Goons were utterly crushed. There was no content left in fighting them.
---
It was clear the content was back when they started anchoring shit in Delve.
---
I mean, if you assumed 2 days left to claim meant 2-2.9 days, that's on you.
---
Run lvl 3 electricials, the cap bonus makes it a trivial excercise in a retri.
---
You needed to take a day off to log in and click redeem? What kind of shitty job do you have that you don't have 5 minutes to sit down in front of a computer?
---
And it is said 'dumb krabs' who made your alliance relevant in the first place. the Delve Time Unit only exists because of these people.
---
this is what happens when you let literally anyone into your alliance, it rots from the inside
---
Petition, CCP loves handing out free SP. It's literally their one thing.
---
/thread
---
Krabs dying in Delve during deployment is like natural selection. In the end our enemies are doing us a favor. :D
---
When they weren't hitting TEST, they were hitting Brave.
---
Goons tend to keep to themselves up until they don't.  NCPL just pick someone smaller than them and just grind until they can't anymore.  I guess Goons after WWB weren't small enough for NCPL to consider "fun".
---
Basically NCPL were bluetral with goons long  before we were.  Do you really need an explicit NIP if you just *don't want to* hit each other's structures?
---
I’m liking the reddit war, more action than eve ever gave me.
---
Petition CCP, make a ticket about it, get their attention.
---
Drifted out of tether range from the Keepstar. Then bumped even more by a lif when it left tether.
---
&gt; I don't want to lose any ships, ever. 
---
Again, as I said:
---
&gt; If you don't appreciate that the risk/reward balance has always been an inherent part of Eve Online, you don't deserve to be taken seriously in balance discussions.
---
If you don't want to lose any ships, perhaps you should farm in hisec.
---
&gt; You'll be on the server by yourself.
---
Again, this is just plain false. People won't stop Rorqual mining just because they statistically began losing a Rorqual per 500 hours of mining instead of 1300.
---
When wartime comes, Darwin takes a visit over to Delve
---
Sure I'll sell you a matching pair mate, send deposit payment of 5b ISK to Zeroniss so I know you're a genuine buyer.
---
Lol.  Strong work admitting it and good save in the end.  When you get stuck in those kinds of situations it’s amusing the silly things you can overlook.  
---
Live (or not) but hopefully learn something either way.
---
i wouldnt either, never heard of the artist but damm Prague is such a beautifull city
---
Hey, that's obviously not the case any more. After recruiting Bat Country, Pandemic Horde has received the infusion of experienced pilots that they so desperately needahaahahahaha I can't keep this up
---
Damn lost around $700 because he forgot to hit Ctrl+spacebar... F
---
This almost made me shit my pants
---
Lol...your not wrong.
---
This is the infamous chick and egg question!!!
---
An interesting idea, but there is no good way to enforce it.  The only option I can see to make that happen is to start making a public name for yourself across New Eden, and attempt to represent the interests of a certain group with that reputation.
---
Null Sec Alliances will generally have considerable advantages in any system involving voting, just because they are the largest, most organized groups in the game.
---
I don't mind, let them blow up as many capitals as they can from the idiots that still do stupid things even with the umbrella gone. It'll drive up the prices a bit, and it means more people buying my capitals when the war ends.
---
I’ll miss it by a similar amount
---
Why not Tribute-caliber popcorn production?
---
I welcome them to delve, because every super they kill means more money in my pocket. They're actually helping us by killing the Krabs, and theyre so obsessed with their "kill board stats" to understand it
---
I got screwed on the last one too
---
Make felt ecm drones so i can throw them out the window.
---
&gt; so there wasn't a whole lot of reason to want to chase GOONS across the entire map playing wack-a-mole when doing so could mean losing supers/titans to gain comparatively little.
---
I can think of one reason.  It'd help prevent their current predicament.
---
Look at what they did to Brave.  Brave had the potential to be more influential than Horde is today.  Instead NCPL systematically destroyed Brave over years.  They grinded them down multiple times and assimilated the concept that made them strong (created Horde).
---
Goons would have been a tougher opponent, and Goons would a absolutely still be stronger than Brave is today, but Goons would be *much, much* more manageable.  And if NCPL plays their cards right, Goons and TEST spend most of their efforts fighting each other.
---
NCPL had many choices.  With some easy geopolitical play, they don't even have to become huge crabs.  All they have to do is suppress Goons a little early and not help find them allies.
---
What do you mean "statistically begin losing"?  There's no "statistically losing".  There is only "losing".   And no, people don't want to be your content.  People are risk averse, especially with expensive PvE ships.  The only reason Delve is a target rich environment is because of the level of safety.  Reduce the safety, reduce the number of targets.  It's quite simple.  No idea how you can deny this unless you're being disingenuous, which I suspect is the case.
---
Plus the more supers they loose, the more they are willing to krab them back. Thanks corp tax.
---
LOL
---
#toastdelvenow!!!

#everyoneunitevsthegoonmenace

It's always downtime. What did you expect? CCP catering to your time zone? Sorry for you man. 
---
Instead of complaining, file a petition saying please please please let me have it. What's there to lose, they might just do it.
---
Another happy customer. Just be polite.
---
The in-game timer is also tricking.
---
I login, claim my reward. It says 15/16 Days claimed with 1 day left on the 19th. So I thought I could claim the last one on the 20th.
---
Anyone who has been in GSF can easily tell you that the handful of people left behind doing this and losing ships is not in any way, shape, or form the backbone of our economy. The actual backbone docked up and went north. Less than 50 losses for a coalition of thousands isn't a threat, it's a drop in the bucket. If everyone who has lost a ship these past few days does leave for grass on the other side of a fence, nothing will occur.
---
I came back this month not even knowing about the rewards. Then omega'd 4 accounts to start a mining fleet a day later thinking I had just enough time to get the sp. I missed the million sp on 4/5 accounts by one day. I'm not only disappointed in losing out on the bonus reward but apparently I can't math either...
---
Same here, every one but the last one, came to get it today all excited, nope, CCP fucked it again.
---
Not sure its the frustration as much as the infrastructure. If you have 10 titans in build, it sucks to lose them, move all your minerals, wait for sov to support sotiyos, start production again.
---
(Copy pasted my recent reply to the top in case it might be helpful)
---
100% pvp.
---
I connected my PC to a smart plug and enabled auto boot from BIOS. Works really well. But I also on vacation and decided that $30 or whatever it is was not worth me worrying about it at all.
---
If you know Studio Ghibli movies you know his music, he's like the Asian counterpart to Ennio Morricone. And yes, Prague is a really beautiful city. Chockfull of tourists , but being one myself I can't complain.
---
I feel you. Just got a carrier after 3 years in the game. To be fair I've had dreads for a while, but still new to fighter mechanics.
---
Look how much time he even spent to put this post together. That's pure desperation right there. :D
---
23:59 in which timezone
---
100% pvp. 
---
Log 1 character, dscan look for target, if no i switch to another character.
---
Manytime i log some cap to answer a ping to help a blue rorqual tackled.
---
Repeat and repeat.
---
I think Island because its ccp.
---
&gt; What do you mean "statistically begin losing"? There's no "statistically losing". There is only "losing".
---
What that means is some people will lose in less time, some in more time, but statistically it'll average out 500 instead of 1300.
---
&gt; People are risk averse, especially with expensive PvE ships.
---
Your risk aversion is irrelevant. Each ship you lose converts to meaningful gametime other players. That cumulative gametime is much higher than what you just lost. People killing ships how CCP keep people playing Eve.
---
What you want is people safely krabbing in their space without disturbance. But that means hunters of those ships leaving the game. But then you would leave the game so fast if the only people left in the game are krabs. You'd have nothing to do with all those assets you spend hours farming. NC, PL, PH, all those people the opposite of whom you like to identify yourself, wouldn't exist. Yours is a cancerous mentality that only cares about self interest. You can't appreciate improvements of many people's interest is also important for you to keep playing a meaningful game.
---
As someone not involved in these Null Sec wars, the summary does appear to match my outsider's perspective.
---
Goonswarm is moving sufficient assets to burn anything they want.  NC. is apparently moving most of their assets out of the freefire zone, and encouraging people to hunt ~~NPCs~~ obsessive PvE players in Goon space and claiming glorious victory, while simultaneously being confused that anyone would expect them to fight the Goonswarm head-on.
---
And r/eve just fills up with garbage posts, as per usual, so nothing has really changed here.
---
All in all, good summary.
---
You should seriously stop posting. You are the pubbie carebear shitler that is ruining this game...
---
You might have, but it's not like noone watches 1DQ, every group has multiple eyes at all times. I think you might overestimate your impact compared to our sabres, the bumping lif, bomber fleet and dreads. Noone ever mentioned your name, so it's not surprising at all.
---
This whole process just feels bad and unenjoyable. At least the Christmas stuff was mostly take it or leave it, and the majority of the useful items were interspersed in the days leading up to the end. 
---
Like it’s free stuff whatever I’m not entitled to it but the way the date was formatted I thought I had time. I missed a few days due to work literally exhausting me to the point that I’d come home and go to sleep but managed to hit 15/16 on 33 characters - fuck me right?
---
When the prize is literally two weeks of subbed training time - worth billions of isk AND more SP than they gave away for the huge structural issues chat failing to work for 8 months caused - like, just come the fuck on.

It’s so stupid and nitpicky, they could’ve just said oh it’s the anniversary month, log in a couple times for some nice giveaways and given some fun cosmetics and a few ships away cool whatever. Instead now they give us a huge carrot to log in, and... 4 days of flexibility to make sure we claim it, 16 out of 20? Did nobody look at this and go “This seems like it would make a lot of people mad just because of how it’s structured”?
---
This is it...the shitpost to destroy all other shitposts
---
CCP also didnt do a final day sale this year, where the bring back all the discounted items of the last 18 days for 1 day.
---
Does anyone have a list of all the SKINs that were on sale in the last 18 days? I might still be able to get some for cheap before the traders drive up the prices.
---
I think this one wooshed over your head
---
Those possibilities exist in real-life sovereign corps as well. There are solutions and incentives that prevent those anti-shareholder actions from being successful. One is distributed resource control: control over the corp's resources is distributed to shareholders. For example, if you have 1% of the shares, then you will have absolute control over something worth 1% of the entire worth of the corp's resources. A planet, for ex. That planet controller will have a corp-title explicitly stating this. That corp-title is sellable. The corp makes a profit by taxing that corp-title. The corp-title is also protected by the corp's military. So while the tax *revenue* is controlled by the CEO, the resources that generate that tax revenue is not. This means the CEO can run away with that quarter's revenue, but he'll end up losing wealth in the process. The shareholders can cryptographically freeze his shares. In fact, it's dumb not to freeze the shares of any shareholder before they get any control. That way he loses his entire wealth if he steals because some majority of shares needs to approve the unfreezing of the CEO's shares when he steps down. An ethereum smartcontract can do this trustlessly.
---
Tell me more.
---
It won't "average out" will it.  There will be a distribution.  Some people will always be further out to the left.  Others will always be further out to the right.  The ones further out to the left, who're losing their ships "statistically more often" will stop using them.  You'll be left with the people "statistically further to the right", i.e. those who're attentive, competent and more risk averse.  
---
It's a ratchet, don't you see?  You'll be whining you can't kill anything after taking out the low hangers, all over again.  Eventually you'll have no content at all, which appears to be what you want.
---
How will they do that if they can't get 51% (or 76%) share approval?
---
The PA acquisition hasn't had any real affect.
---
your posts started like lot of screeching last year but I have to admit I've enjoyed most of them lately. I agree that the game is stagnant or at least straying away from its potential. Unsure how you got the 3% risk but I m also unsure how everyone would benefit from more dangerous nullsec. As the game is designed, they'd have to come up with something creative and revolutionary, else it's just screwing over the smaller entities.

---
This is just: "lol already replaced" with extra steps
---
Fuck off will you, dear.
---
It's still a fun game to play. I would suggest just playing for free as an Alpha clone if your time is limited.
---
&gt;It's impossible to finish anyone in Eve 
---
Tell that to CO2.  Yeah, you can't finish anyone, but you can absolutely cleave their power in a way that will take them years to recover.
---
Take TEST and the Halloween War as another example.
---
&gt; Blue donut is cancer. 
---
Don't be in one?
---
The acquisition didn’t change the game, but the changes to the game (skill inj, capital proliferation, blind eye to botting, etc) made it not worth it (imho)
---
So the game is roughly the same? That's good to hear.
---
PLEX per month is now at 2.2 bil and there is a new racial ship line. Besides that everything is as it was before.
---
This is Eve v2.0
---
Is that... jealousy?  Sounds like you're jealous.
---
Iirc I won't be able to fly my carrier etc on Alpha? I don't mind paying to play tbf.
---
&gt; The ones further out to the left, who're losing their ships "statistically more often" will stop using them
---
This happens right now too. There are people who die more often. It's often their fault. It turns out they don't stop farming. And those who die so often should perhaps reconsider their habits, or moving to hisec.
---
&gt;  Eventually you'll have no content at all
---
Not really. Again, losing a Rorqual per 500 hour of mining instead of 1300 won't make people stop Rorqual mining. In fact, the yield nerfs do make them stop at a much greater degree (e.g. last few months of MER).
---
i too couldnt belive i reading those lines as top comment in this thread :P
---
Goons in peacetime: check out the MER
---
Goons in wartime: we disavow the krabs
---
Guys, your whole schtick is welcoming the carebear side of EVE. Own it, flaunt it.
---
Yeah we remember staying long enough last year to kill 8 keepstar without loosing one. And a lot of titan that were not turbokrab but real pvper ;)
---
The link below is the last time I've heard of the share system attempting to be used.

---
&gt; It turns out they don't stop farming.
---
So what the fuck are you complaining about?
---
it's free
---
try it and quit when you don't like it
---
It's called Maths not Math in English (Traditional), as opposed to English (Simplified).
---
How about...no? Eve is "dont risk what you cant afford to lose" and "your ship is lost as soon as you press 'undock'", and has been the entirety of it's existence. You and your ilk dont get to just un-write that because you've decided you want to be 100% safe, 100% of the time, anywhere you like. If that's what you're looking for, go find another fucking game.
---
The esteemed John Hartley, the sane guiding force in a redline fleet
---
I'm not complaining.
---
You are complaining about my posts. You are pretty agitated too.
---
My posts were asking for 15% risk instead of 3% in nullsec.
---
I'm sending in a fuckin ticket. It said I had a whole day left to get my stuff and of course this fall's on the one business trip I have a year.
---
Remember, battle of F4R2 was TEST and most of Legacy against goons and russians.
---
&gt; dont risk what you cant afford to lose
---
Do you understand the English language?  It seems you don't.
---
Yes I see your point. It's becoming obvious. And it works. I subbed 2 alt accs for these juicy awards. I even actually played a bit on my main. Now I am asking myself, what to train on those newly subbed alts I don't intend to keep omega as of now. PI? Jita trader probably. Scanner ofc. Never frown upon an extra scanner when wormhole diving btw.
---
It's very possible...I take the internet seriously...and I am also unnaturaly short.
---
&gt;co2 coming to help GOTG was the worst thing that could ever happen in the eyes of Goons.  It ensured we would never leave until we won, they should have stayed as far away from Goons as they possibly could.  
---
Can you explain this?
---
&gt; Unsure how you got the 3% risk
---
Maybe hard to believe, but I'm the sort of person who actually goes out of his way to gather relevant data before making these claims.
---
For the 3%, I'm cross-referencing MER data with zkill data. Measuring that risk easier for mining ships. You just divide the value lost in mining ships to the mining gains in MER's. We worked hard to come up with a good filter of ratting ships as well. It's not as good, but it gives a good idea. The results are similar.
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1goutrhQADKczT9MLzA47Crdf3JwsVu5PNDHKN_qIvTs/edit#gid=391531178
---
Yeah GotG are shitters and no one should work with Sort.  That's true.
---
I'm not agitated but as you keep pressing your retarded "percentage risk" argument, I will keep replying.  It's the kind of argument someone with a very low resolution brain would propose.
---
set up some public dread contracts for us, we will happily oblige to fill your pockets
---
We disavow the retarded jeans
---
I been subbed continuously for about 8 years. I just quit. 
---
Maybe you’ll find something fun to do, good luck.
---
i did exactly that about 11 hours ago. however the timer was still showing 7 or 8 hours of the event left at that point. I am dubious it would still work, now, after downtime.
---
Iirc it's based on how many votes get put through, it doesn't restrict based on total shares
---
Who would know people's risk-taking behavior would be more complicated than "I don't wanna lose even 1 ship or else I will dock". Fuck me for talking about risk in terms of money you lose vs money you gain right?
---
Exactly this.
---
Great so I can play eve while I krab in eve
---
&gt;we don't call FRAT to save us, aka a different coalition
---
You've *absolutely* called Frat to help with multiple timers in the north.  You've also shown up to any significant Fraternity timers.
---
I fail to see the difference.
---
I'm glad to see they're back under a bil lmao
---
Inb4 hilmar "do you guys not have phones?"
---
You got many answers in your post.
---
Why would you *want* to lose a 2.5b ship and 5b in drones, unless you're a credit card warrior undocking in 1dq for the lols on your stream?  Seriously, who undocks expecting that?  Who undocks thinking, hmmm, 3% chance all my shit is going to explode?  Nobody.  So your entire thesis is hilariously stupid.
---
&gt; Who undocks thinking, hmmm, 3% chance all my shit is going to explode?
---
You see, there is already 3% chance. If people don't care about that, what makes you think they'll care about 15% chance?
---
Not overestimating anything, in what I wrote I made sure most of those involved were mentioned to credit them, those who provided intel, bubbles, cyno'd, brought in their bombers, dreads etc.
---
Giving the impression it was a BomberBars/DPCI and their op and not a coordinated effort by only mentioning them is something I am correcting.
---
They should still just be merged with ihubs. That was *supposed* to happen like two years ago.
---
Merge TCU and IHUB first.   Increase cyno jammer cycle time to 4+ hours instead of five minutes.
---
Same here! I filed a petition with CCP. I resubbed in order to get the reward, so I feel ripped off.
---
This is why I said your thinking is low-resolution.  It's not 3% is it.   It's far lower than 3%.  And it's not 3% for each individual.  It's 0.3% for some, 3.3% for others.  9% for yet others.  You will run out of targets because those on the left will drop out or become those on the right.  And those on the right are quite hard to kill.  It's a ratchet.  The more you feed, the less content you'll have.
---
Yeah because we bot.  Oh wait....
---
Careful you know ccp tracks down and bans all goon spies, you are walking a fine line.
---
Is PvP basically always on in this game? No safe areas?
---
I at least assumed 2 days left meant 2 days and not 1.4 days.   The event ended at 11:00 Eve time on the 20th, which means it was less than half the day.
---
Same happened to me :(
---
what are you recording with?
---
Whew I remember this one
---
Yeah I picked the wrong time to be in the hospital.
---
Pretty sure all creativity is immediately snuffed out by Hilmar
---
Do you know how many Goon Multiboxers would shit their bricks if input broadcasting was permitted?
---
Popcorn makers are in storage boxes alongside the unanchored structures. Maybe the could ask the spire.....oh wait......
---
We...Horde still has structures standing. Maybe they could go round there and borrow theirs.
---
\*maffs
---
I've never been on the CCP hate wagon. I've always been the person to give them the benefit of the doubt. This event may have been the straw that broke the camel's back. So on that note, Dear CCP...
---
As someone who has been mostly afk in game for the past year or so due to real life obligations, but who still keeps their accounts in Omega status, this whole "celebration" has left me extremely disillusioned. I don't spend every day on this sub or on the official forums. I don't log in every day. I hadn't even heard of this "celebration" until about 5 days in, so it was pretty frustrating and lame seeing rewards I could not get just because I have a life outside of this game. Were these only intended to be redeemed by the supernerds who live in this game? Are we supposed to be gaining a sense of pride and accomplishment by logging in for 30 seconds per account per day?
---
In the past there have been events with rewards each day (ex: Yule lads) where you could still get all of the rewards as long as you logged in to claim them (ALL of them) before 1-2 weeks after the event. For a person with a schedule like mine that was awesome and exactly what I had hoped for. This event on the other hand (and similar ones they have run in the recent past) just come off as a pathetic attempt at manipulating people to log in in an attempt to do, what? Artificially boost their numbers? Trick people into logging in more so they might say "you know what, I wasn't going to undock **but now I totally am!**"?
---
At the moment I feel nothing but resentment, and I'm starting to think I won't be renewing my accounts annually anymore. I'm paying you guys $300+ per year for this stupid game and you can't even throw me a bone without 20 strings being attached to it. Oh yea, I also bought the anniversary box set, that mystery code sure has come in handy like, one time? Two?
---
I don't want you to give me the free stuff I missed. I just want you to stop doing shitty events with shitty login requirements that insult your casual players.
---
first of very nice  gif. qaulity shit post enabled .   would have been better if you did not de-anchor everything. Start spamming rats for the goons to burn through lol
---
Nah, we just wait a few weeks till everyone gets bored and goes back to Delve and we move back in.
---
&gt; It's not 3% is it. It's far lower than 3%.
---
It is about 3%s on average. I actually [gather that data.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1goutrhQADKczT9MLzA47Crdf3JwsVu5PNDHKN_qIvTs/edit#gid=391531178)
---
I argued people won't stop mining if they lost one Rorqual per 500 hours instead of 1300. You are saying some people will lose their ships in less time, then stop farming. Each Rorqual can farm itself in 40ish hours (assuming a conservative 130m/hr yield - and 5b ship price (excavators are 550m now fyi)). Let's say those who lose a Rorqual per 80 hours leave, as their isk/hr is halved now. If the average was 500, what percentage of Rorqual pilots you think would actually lose a Rorqual per 80 hours? 1%? 3%? 5%? Note that you'd have to be really really dumb to lose that many.
---
So you are basically saying that I will run out of targets because some 5% of Rorquals will have to stop mining.
---
..?
---
Obs
---
Because you're searching for AZaz
---
Or it's just people playing a game, having fun, and being excited about it. Where else do you get guaranteed supper and titty easy dunks without slogging through absolute shit tidi KS fights or fishing traps that are few and far between. It's a blast mate. Doesn't really matter if it hurts Goons bottom line, I'm logging in again for the first time in awhile cause of it.
---
Goons always: Retarded krabs deserve to die
---
Same thing happened to me, I wish they gave more specific details on this event. But I mean ‘fuck people who buy your product’ is kinda the slogan of CCP recently.
---
How did you gather the data?  If you did it with your own cloaky campers in local, you've already fucked up your stats.  Good job.
---
That’s obnoxious. I was going to do it yesterday but it said 2 days left
---
I need a Hel actually. Can you give me a good price on one? I'm already in Delve so I can just pick it up there.
---
the small core defense field extender I has just got a huge spike, maybe it's related.
---
I tried to get addicted, several times, over 10 years. Didn’t work. Logistics are a nightmare. Probably played less than 100 hours in a decade, but I do keep that skill queue going. :p
---
Like an egg in the microwave.
---
&gt;Maybe hard to believe, but I'm the sort of person who actually goes out of his way to gather relevant data before making these claims.
---
Like claiming 8 actions per second is inhuman speed even to alt tab?
---
why won't you fight the umbrella directly??
---
The "counter play" to Olmeca's drops is to just not be bad. That's all it is. Read that list you just made. Everything except the inhib are just BASICS of flying a capital at all. 
---
"Sure, our guy made a giant list of mistakes, and without them we drop titans, but we need MORE counterplay." The whole argument revolves around people who, for practical purposes, could not do anything more to feed short of jumping directly into hostiles.
---
pretty much, yeah.
---
Goons tried to make their own gambling site...
---
It's just no one used it.
---
As a multibox bomber with years of practice, I rarely achieve 8 launches per second. A Goon Rorqual multiboxer? Yeah it's reasonable assume he's isboxing.
---
that there is brutal honesty
---
Don't worry little bro. I was also denied membership and I have 120m sp. 
---
Although it might have something to do with me linking Spongbob porn in fleet chat during grind fleets.
---
yeah i'm curious as well
---
Collect all mining/ratting losses per region, and divide it to MER gains per region.
---
I don't have cloaky campers. Cloaky campers in Delve don't change a lot.
---
in the most general sense yes, undocking is consent to being shot at
---
Server time is universal.
---
The reason I ask is because I would’ve assumed to have already been blown up at this point, as I’m still just doing beginner military agent missions and tutorials
---
Dont worry code flair guy.  I still love you.
---
Though i do wonder how code intends to save us from the mango and frat bot overlords.
---
And all the moon miners.
---
And all the regular miners.
---
And the freighters which i still see afking around.
---
All bees are the same, with the amount of gender changing going on, wont you panty sniffers save your sisters?
---
Pro Tip : ping that a neuting Rorqual is on grid to get saved!
---
c'mon. An average person writes at over 8 strokes per second, a setup that tabs with one key and recall with another makes it possible to hit even more than 8 on one server tick.
---
Shut up Putin you've been found out.
---
This is a completely accurate prediction. /remindme 4 years (or however that shitty bot works) 
---
As CCP Fozzie’s final act of Sabotaging EVE he will release a final update before servers shut down that puts a gate from Perimeter straight to Texas for the Goons to escape Old Eden.
---
Servers shut down January 2024.
---
You should just build a power rack in your living room. You can definitely play eve and lift weights at the same time.
---
That doesn't tell you anything about the probability somebody is going to explode when they undock.
---
What new groups lol
---
Boiling water still burns when the pot runs dry.
---
Imagine being a bottom of the barrel retard Nd thinking structure bashing is more fun than killing retards in delve
---
It does tell you the ratio of people's farm converting to killmails. Which is what matters for content. Ofc it doesn't take external factors into account, like how Goons are on deployment right now.
---
Bro you're just talking to talk right now and frankly I'm tired. Enjoy your day.
---
I used to play nearly that much.  Considering getting more active/ joining an active group again. 
---
If I wasn’t playing so much damn sea of thieves lol
---
As someon explained in another post, most of the people were burned out because of WWB, so they had to do some other things.
---
As for why they didn't hit goons all this time, bite me I don't fucking know. Truth be told I would not want to invade good right now, even with superior numbers, do to the sheer amount of structures to bash.
---
What If I'm still using injectors &amp; training SP?
---
&gt; a setup that tabs with one key and recalls with another
---
You are describing round robin input broadcasting, which is illegal for CCP. People have been banned for that.
---
When I bomb I have to click certain regions in my monitor to switch clients, and then bomb. You can spam the bomb button, But try clicking 8 regions in your monitor under 1 second.
---
That's a bad system.
---
Audible is an American football reference, you may have just confused all our EUTZ friends.
---
Cyno Jammers actively help smaller groups, so I'm not sold on that being the solution. Outside of Mega-alliance leaders bitching about them when other solutions clearly present themselves, I'm not aware of any crippling abilities of cyno jammers that make them more problematic that jump bridges
---
Why not give the TCU a purpose and add depth to sov warfare, instead of merging the two and changing nothing?
---
trading 1 excavator and a close up of my feet for an nc vouch
---
They didn't see it coming, probably.
---
As you all know, NCPL were "elites" alliances that didn't like krabs and were probably underestimating the power of goon krabbing morale.
---
After that, and you can ask everyone, nobody can survive a Delve invasion, you would die of boredom bashing structures.
---
In HS, shooting someone who has done nothing "wrong" is a guaranteed death sentence. People will still do it, but usually suicide ganking is restricted to for-profit purposes (though not always). There are also some systems that CCP has stated are off limits, specifically new player systems, career agent systems, and some systems related to the Blood Stained Stars epic arc, as those are areas that are mostly populated by extremely new players. Ganking in these areas is still possible, but doing so risks a ban and is generally not worth it.
---
&gt;You are describing round robin input broadcasting
---
Changing the keys that switch windows and the key that recalls drones is hardly input broadcasting.
---
Well... If you "see" them, then it's not "blind" :v
---
The issue here I think is the dynamics of the system.  It's not linear.  Even simplified Lotka–Volterra equations won't do it justice.  My point is watch and see what happens during deployment.  The amount that dies will be high to begin with and will slowly reduce over time down to some background steady (gently oscillating) state.   My contention is that if you hold one variable fixed (% chance of dying when you undock), other variables will change (pilots in space engaging in risky behavior).  I don't know why anyone would argue with this.  It seems to be quite a trivial conclusion.
---
You too.
---
I used to play this game for hours on end, I love the game and still do, I'm just completely burnt out right now and maybe log in a few hours a week to see what's going on and maybe go on a fleet op
---
I check this subreddit almost every day because I love to what else is going on in Eve.
---
Because of the betrayal in the last war them switching sides and actively fighting against us it was a goal of mine to see this alliance eliminated.  They put themselves within reach of us and gave us another opportunity to destroy them.  
---
It was motivating.
---
now... do i say "inb4 support tickets" or am i too late for that?
---
Never said that we should no fight each other, which is this game selling point.
---
As goon stands today, nobody want to fight the super huge blob of Goonswarm plus other pets.
---
The big issue is goons pets never wanting to exit the influence of their master. Take INIT for example, they could be a solo alliance with a force that can be reckoned with, but they still mostly do the same thing as goons do and never fights them.
---
As numbers go, NCPL alone could probably fight goonswarm alone for an extended period of time. Not with the rest of the universe coming too.
---
As for Delve kills... the same can be applied to NC loses in this war if only removing structures. Most of the structures still in place are either rare alliance assets used for strategic interest or moving, or either corp personal structures that won't hurt the alliance if killed.
---
At the end, everyone is a game of perspective. If you think you lose nothing, and the guy in front does, you will flex.
---
I like to stay open-minded on that.
---
Wonder how many anchor/unanchor cycles you can take
---
Not like they need it though. Anybody saying goons is not number 1 by a large margin is either spinning or retarded. Probably both ?
---
Some viable corvettes would be nice, sure.
---
Truth be told, who cares ? Not like we, as members, are using even 5% of the space.
---
Renting is another thing, but isn't it time for renting to die anyway ?
---
Sephron_tanully, I am glad you liked it. It means a lot to me. :)
---
And i keep telling Intaky I cap up after the target is dead. There is plenty of time before the siege ends. While the hotdrop is on (and I am recording)  I am more worried about the outcome of the fight/video, getting better angles of the fight and making sure everyone is doing fine. Also, I am constantly checking my secondary screen. -.-
---
I mean nullsec and delve in particular are only safe because the people in it are working hard to make it safe. If the Imperium wouldnt work on that then nullsec would be easily one of the riskiest places. The only options I would see is reworking local mechanics and banning keepstars again. Its just our intel that helps us getting our space safe. 
---
Otherwise I could only think about more npc stations deeper in nullsec.
---
This is beyond annoying! I have a little thing called work and missed out because of it. its still 20th of May here...WTF CCP
---
I'm pretty sure that's not NC/PL policy but otherwise I agree.
---
bots.
---
CCP can limit that, though. One way is to provide these bonuses only on the first character on the first account associated with a particular email. It's not a perfect system, but it's good enough to at least make things slightly more difficult for botters.
---
I love these videos. Please keep it up.
---
Could be both, lol
---
Honestly I'm embarassed.  I don't claim to be an expert, but even in the days when you had to train to fit rigs, I figured out pretty quickly to fill in the blanks. smh
---
And data sites m8
---
If goons manage to do more than one full deployment a year I'll be shocked. SO I guess one anchor/unanchor cycle a year I guess.
---
Where did I say doxxing is okay? I've openly criticised probotlegend for doxxing the CEO of SLYCE.        
---
Also, what SLYCE did doesn't "border on" anything. It was a harmless joke.
---
Only Improved, surely.
---
Well I can only say what I think about it. But people have to evolve somehow.
---
Why would goons burn geminate, horde is one of the few groups that still undock to give fights, killing them off isn't in anyone's interest
---
eve isn’t real life. generally the team with 2x the numbers win.
---
I'd rather new players be able to fly cruisers from each race at level I than cruisers from one race at level III-IV.
---
literally had 2 extra days to collect rewards, sucks to set an alarm in your phone I guess
---
You goons always say "we" like you aren't just NPCs in the Shittanis game of sims.
---
It feels so bad. All these comments talking about "duh, that's how DT works," are like someone pointing to fine print on something and saying"see, it is all there." Yeah, we know that's how DT works, but the way the event was phrased was misleading, whether intentional or not.
---
CCP should let us trade in all the useless crap we already got that I haven't redeemed yet to get the rewards for the 20th that we weren't able to get today.
---
Yeah I really like this kind of videos and you have done a nice Job showing the drop. Keep it up.
---
Dang that sucks and I would have been pretty mad if that had happened to me. I like the idea of filing a petition! I hope you do that and it works. I got it and I was pretty happy with it, but at the same time it got me about a weeks worth of training - which is great, not so huge in the grand scheme of things. The skill I’m training into now is going to take two weeks! This game teaches patience and disappointment!
---
I moved to Delve. It's way better than lowsec
---
It's not losing, it's strategic relocation of assets.
---
we're in may m8
---
and sure, play the game
---
I said 'we probably agree totally on this point, public doxxing isn't okay.' You said, 'we don't totally agree.'
---
Given that, I took your meaning to be pretty straight forward. I was never suggesting we didn't not agree on how to respond to racist, jingoistic behavior that implies 'I am better than you because my country is better.' I mean, clearly like many people from predominately European countries who post on r/eve you *are* cool to mix a little racial/cultural superiority with your eve.
---
Make hilariously bad decisions about stuff so that EVE got worldwide free press coverage for something that current EVE players would forget about a week or so later. Wait.......
---
Just a fair warning. The community here loves the game but can see the potential the developers are ignoring. So the community sometimes will be mad about the game, but in the end, it is fun for a specific type of person. Try the free trial and get connected with EveUniversity.
---
&gt; We're not going north for content.
---
Sounds like the kind of thing Doomchinchilla would say
---
Fuck
---
Pretty accurate.
---
Though I don't think there is much bots in tribute, look for Malpais, Vale and Delve for that.
---
Ok thanks. Also free trial for what?
---
Sorry, but you don't have enough un-anchoring structures to qualify as Tribute.
---
I preferred Pandemic Phone.
---
You might be the maddest dude on the entire subreddit lmao. What did goons do to get in your head so bad?
---
Who said they'd permanently stop krabbing?  I guarantee you they wouldn't be doing it in Rorquals with excavators or supers and Titans esp after the NSA changes.  It would be pretty much as it was before the Rorqual changes.
---
Also what is ISK
---
This question gets asked a lot, and the answer is pretty much always the same: It depends on what you like.
---
If you gave a list of previous games you've played we could give a more informed answer, but as it is you're just asking a bunch of people who play the game if they like the game.
---
Well that’s also just the problem. I haven’t been able to stick with any game really because of the community. What games is this game like? Maybe that will help.
---
&gt;billboard ads

---
Yet, people were banned for round robin broadcasting.
---
CCP rules don't depend on whether you think certain micro actions are simple or no different than Windows actions. It depends on whether they provide unfair play. The functionality you are talking about is unfair play. I could conduct 40 man bombing runs with it without sweating a bat against your fleets, after which you'd report me instantly.
---
PS: There is no "key to switch" windows in Windows. Alttab doesn't function as "maximize next window, minimize previous window". If you constantly alttabbed, you'd be switching between only 2 clients. You need particular software for what you want.
---
Who cares? It isn't permitted *for most things* for a good reason. And I might add, Mar5meca has denied repeatedly using any input broadcasting at all, despite being *caught* and outed by an actual real world news publication. 
---
Unfortunately, CCP has not blanket banned input broadcasting, which they should, so Mar5meca avoided the ban because the 'proof' was in chat broadcasts, which are permitted; however, anyone who has ever watched Mar5meca do a bombing run knows that Mar5meca is, or at least has in the past, been using input broadcasting in full on cheat mode. 
---
And anyone doing that, goon or pubbie, deserves to be unceremoniously banned from Eve. 
---
PS. The really funny thing is, despite *being caught* Mar5meca denies *ever* using input broadcasting for anything. He apparently can copy and past a single text message into 60 different chat windows on multiple clients in less than a second with his fingers.
---
Just won EVE (at least for the next few weeks/months) due to some mental health issues. Didn't have any problem committing to not logging in for anything more than updating my characters. So I'd say no.
---
You're right, he's a bit on the low side with that estimate.
---
Poor Bonga .\_.
---
same problem with 4 accounts. 15/16 prices claimed. :(
---
Do you dispute this?
---
What the fuck else am I supposed to say?
---
Breh, haven't you seen the reports?  Only bots that popped up are former NC renters now in our renter program WHO GOT BANNED lol.
---
In-game currency. "Interstellar Space Kredit"
---
Ok thanks
---
&gt;This is not aimed at us, nor do I think it ever will be.
---
Send me your ISK and I'll *triple* it.
---
There aren't free trials anymore but there are 2 different types of clones, alpha and omega. Alpha are free, omega are based off a monthly subscription. Alpha are of course pretty limited in what you can do, while Omega you can do whatever. Get an invite link to click to create an account and you'll get free skill points to do more at the start. And Eve University is a great starter spot for newbies.
---
Hey if dust was on pc I would have played the shit out of it while waiting on things
---
I've been saying that about EVE every 3-4 months for the last two years dude.
---
Ok so should I start free then buy a membership or should I just buy a membership.?
---
I love variety in Eve, just like everyone else I think, HOWEVER...
---
Your recommendation would do more harm than good!!
---
The mining economy doesn't need any other hull to keep the minerals flowing freely!
---
Rorquals already are a bigass hammer approach to the ore nail problem that we never had!
---
If GigX didn't get banned it honestly would not have been as bad, like Co2 Would be very likely to recover but because it was a cult of personality alliance his ban was basically the killing blow.
---
I agree. I have the same problem and I am pretty mad about it.
---
For some people they've spent so long krabbing to get that super or titan that the huge tidi shitfests are the only time they are actually going to use it for anything other than bridging or bosoning frigates in Delve, so they will sit through it for that chance to DD an enemy titan.
---
I don't know how it would do any harm. I never said it would be *better* just more flexible. I'd pay more for one hull that could do yield (but less than a hulk), or have tank (but less than a skiff), and could do exploration for gas etc (but less safely than a prospect), and could swap between those roles.
---
As it stands I own like 6, only slightly different, pretty expensive ships just to get all the materials I need for one project.
---
FYI thete are multiple guides online with fits, one even put out by CCP, Google "Abyssal space beginner fits".
---
Strategy games, mostly. Also the action in here is not quite the fast-paced dogfighting you might have seen in trailers, so it's not about reflexes. There's a lot in common with most MMO's, as you can't enjoy all the content by playing solo. For example, a lot of teamwork is involved in maintaining the market going, so if you want to be a merchant it will be a challenge going solo.
---
As far as the community is concerned there's a mix of people. Some will try to scam you out of everything you own, some will give you their time to teach you how everything works. Some groups (corps or alliances) have programs for newer players to provide them ships free of charge so they can get the hang of things.
---
It's all about finding the crown you want to fly with.
---
Eve is like that weird crazy woman that's really not your type but somehow attracts you and if you give it a shot it might end up becoming the worst thing in your life that constantly challenges you, beats you, hurts you and generally fucks you up but also the best thing in your life that provides a level of satisfaction beyond your wildest fantasies.
---
Best comment yet o7
---
Nice.  Never seen that before.
---
If you join EVE with a contact, you get a month's worth of xp, and if you end up buying a subscription the contact gets a reward for having "recruited" you. If you want me to send you a code, let me know, and I'll send you the reward as well if you do stick around.
---
Ok it sounds really fun and I’d love to play which I will when I’m home. I just need to find some people to help me I assume. I’ll play for a while then probably buy a membership.
---
&gt; ause th
---
Fails spectacularly, even though he picks his targets pretty well most times, and gets the ones that are hyper fit. Except that time he got tricked and accidentally dropped a full tank fit Hel and lost 7 dreads and 2 high grade slave pods.
---
Just keepstars?  No sir, all your regions things will be burned and you'll have to start from square one again.
---
Start free with a referral link. Spend money once you know you'll stick around.
---
Ok I’ll do that you can dm me! Thanks!
---
Mar5meca is *literally* Mar5y and Olmeca gold. Neither of them will even bother denying it.
---
Oof. Sorry dude.
---
You can dm me the code if you want will it still be valid around 2:30-3. Just asking because idk if they expire.
---
Here is a secret i have not done mining or pve in a year, if my current corp made it mandatory i would drop corp right there on the spot, not because i'm to good for it but because it's a unbelievably boring activity.
---
It's called a joke. It is one we used to use to explain how such a isk negative operator like Mar5y could afford his cloaky camper bot army, because he sure as hell wasn't doing it with plex. 
---
It all made much more sense once we realized that Mar5y and Olmeca were the same person, but the joke persisted.
---
If I ever get to 1k subs, Ill do a live special showing everyone how its done. Its actually very fun.
---
There is something call MER instead of saying " it mean nothing " when goons were bragging about it, they would analyse the mining report; the import/export report and the prod report when it was out they could see it, anyone with a decent mind could have seen it coming. But instead ncpl leadership decide to spin a narrative about goons exporting all to Jita or rmt or when their numbers of supers/titan were almost even with ncpl "goons never commit" I'm too lazy to list all the different narrative ncpl tried to spin over the years fact is, what they were mocking 3 years ago is becoming truth since mittani and aryth were talking about it a bit after delve was taken
---
So yes they could seen it coming and thanks to them every war will become one sided
---
&gt;PS: There is no "key to switch" windows in Windows.

Not defending anyone here, but I think "cheap" isn't a proper way to address SOP right now! &gt;.&gt;

Are you serious? I usually claim late at night.

&gt; It's called a joke. It is one we used to use to explain how such a isk negative operator like Mar5y could afford his cloaky camper bot army, because he sure as hell wasn't doing it with plex.
---
He is a whaler. He doesn't RMT away his income like some in your alliance did. He reinvests it to catch and kill whales. That's all he cares about.
---
Same with me. I injected dreads. I invested my money to redistribute dreads to my friends. I just created 45 alts, so I can join his afk camping.
---
Where else would we spend our ISK if not furthering our playstyles? It all goes to more efficient ways to kill stuff.
---
You have a lot of stuff.
---
In Delve. You just wait for the people who think it's perfectly safe and just gate around instead of using the jump drive. 
---
There's plenty of people who've never known 0.0 as dangerous and they get lazy.
---
AAR? We’re they gating, boson ratting, how were they caught?
---
They banned facism in Canada?
---
&gt; The only options I would see is reworking local mechanics and banning keepstars again. 
---
What we specifically ask for is mobile cyno inhibation rework and more anomaly rework.
---
Regions like Delve don't depend on local.
---
Sent a big long PM explaining the referral link and letting you know that I'm down if you want a tutor for a bit.
---
Wait...I'm in USA at EST, did I miss this too?!!! Do I still have time?
---
&gt;I said 'we probably agree totally on this point, public doxxing isn't okay.' You said, 'we don't totally agree.'
---
No, you just said "we are in total agreement" without additional context. And since we aren't in total agreement I figured I'd correct you on that.      
---
&gt;I mean, clearly like many people from predominately European countries who post on r/eve you are cool to mix a little racial/cultural superiority with your eve.
---
Lotta assertions you're making there. And yeah, everyone thinks their country is the best. It's okay for the Chinese players to talk up their country and their culture and it's okay for European players to talk up their countries and their cultures. It's called banter, you'll get used to it once your balls drop.
---
I like this a lot :)
---
You don't post
---
Oh no we will have to spend a week anchoring new buildings!!! THE HUMANITY! HOW WILL THE NORTH EVER RECOVER FROM THIS MONUMENTAL LOSS?
---
I didn't get the last two days because I didn't know I had to log in every single day to get them. Past anyway giveaways let you get multiple days at once as long as you loved in during the window. I've never been so upset about getting free shit; but there was free shit, so I'm not about to shoot the Jita monument or something. 
---
I'd say that CCP should do a better job with communication; but if they were going to do that, they'd have done it by now.
---
I think olmeca is more grrr goons
---
Lets be honest, EVE's ecomomy broke ages ago and everyone has way to much ISK. Im not taking away the merits of being able to produce capitals, an industrial backbone is very important.. but the whole ISK matters is complete BS.
---
I could see it go that way.
---
I forgot all about the mystery code. What does/did it even do?
---
Well the erebus was appearently afk and drifting off the goon staging keep, then got bumped by a lif and dropped (there is an pretty good aar: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bqnhxx/1dq\_erebus\_kill\_aar\_album/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bqnhxx/1dq_erebus_kill_aar_album/))
---
The Ragnarok was gating around i believe and got caught by one of our hunters, our cyno pilot was new to hunting tho and cynoed within bosonrange of the titan. Thats why it took us a while to get a proper cyno, in the meantime horde also dropped a bunch of bombers on the rag.
---
This. Nearly all of my nullsec exploration has been via wormhole.
---
If you want to blow up support tickets - this is how CCP.  Make it so a lot of people are stuck on day 14 or 15.
---
ihubs + upgrades comes to mind...
---
Why would he care about what is happening when HE is the one happening?
---
Yeah allright this was my bad.
---
Then open notepad and try to push 2 buttons sequentially 8 times (1-2-1-2-1-2-1-2-1-2-1-2-1-2-1-2) under a second. If you randomly spam you will miss recalls.
---
Even mouse/keyboard macros that sequence keystrokes is illegal. Arguably software that reassigns Alt+Esc could be as well, if provides unfair gameplay.
---
And then there is the fact that there is really a low likelyhood this person beginning his keystrokes right at the beginning of a server tick. More likely, it will be somewhere in the middle. So we are actually talking about 8 actions in significantly less than a second.
---
All in all whoever claims "8 actions one tick" is not likely to be ISboxed hasn't been multiboxing himself to experience the practical reality of the situation.
---
Burning geminate almost certainly wouldn't kill horde.
---
Link your lossmail?
---
Two extra days my ass. I never once had the option to collect the last prize, and I've logged in every single day without fail. This is utter bullshit.
---
This subreddit is not a safe-space echo chamber, thank you very much. Just because you don't like my affiliation doesn't mean you should whine like a puppy about me being here because you don't like the big bad evil people on the other side. But at least when a puppy whines, it's cute.
---
Clearly you didn't log in "every single day" since you didn't get the SP.
---
The number of entitled piglets whining about this event boggles my mind.
---
If you don't ever form how do you expect to stop goons from rolling up every single citadel like an old rug?
---
Available to us and aimed at us is very different things. This is purely to capture a market share in Asia.
---

---
BWF-ZZ has been cursed since the beginning of time. Based on historical evidence, a big alliance like goons taking on Geminate would just be a massive waste of time, filled with blue balls followed by three months of desolate space, followed by a whole new conflict in Geminate in 2020. 
---
I mean, sure, it's content in 2020. But honestly, the best possible residents for Geminate short of a small independent group (which could never hold on to anything more than perhaps the infamous 📷 [**IPS-QB**](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Geminate/IPS-QB) constellation) is probably a group like horde.
---
So long story short... it wouldn't be fun to evict horde, it would also be quite expensive and it wouldn't actually make a huge difference.
---
Neato.
---
That would require someone to be in tribute not whaling in delve
---
F NC cocksuckers!
---
I'm not arguing against that choice, but I'm not sure I'd be declaring victory on reddit if I had.
---
Ok, I
---
My down votes are proof of your salt.
---
I stop playing eve each time my subs run out. The issue is I have 42 alts. You see my dilemma
---
That's fine. You don't have an endless supply of them, and the krabs aren't going to get any smarter.
---
You can get 1200+ DPS without using shiny drones IIRC, but the price stay the same since you have to invest in shiny modules as a counterpart --"
---
Looks awesome
---
Check your item queue - usually you have to claim the items at a station
---
the event ended
---
Well, since it's ratting you'll get better results with higher skills trained up, as you'll do more DPS and apply it more consistently. Generally, the Naglfar is a good choice because it's a good middle way between the damage of Revelation and the tracking of Moros, but a Phoenix is a nice approach too, since you'll always do some damage with rapid torps. The reload is going to be your worse nightmare tho &gt;.&lt;
---
I think you can indeed do it. For your first time, I'd say try it on the Singularity server and if you're happy with what you get, throw it on Tranquility.
---
truly this is the end for us.
---
lol
---
&gt; i would simply login every single day and claim my prize.
---
No, you didn't or you would have been finished with the prizes a couple of days ago.
---
I can confirm this, got my 1m sp end of last week.
---
exactly this
---
Drastically change training queues so levels 1-2-3 are pretty low investment and 4-5 are a lot more time intensive
---
Don't you know that day's end at 11am?
---
Tell that to Olmeca.
---
Salty about what lol.
---
IP banning doesn't work. Most ISPs allow MAC address cloning on your router to change your IP. I can honestly change my IP, with just a web browser in about 20 seconds, with a 1 minute reboot of the modem. (Access router webpage, enter new value for CMAC address, reset modem)
---
Thank you, I had absolutely no idea what this was about.
---
What are those?
---
konichiwat.jpg
---
I was in the same situation as the topic starter but I was so desperate I was clicking and checking the campaign UI right until the server reset, I couldn't believe my bad luck, and... 
---
..."0 hours left" changed to "23 hours left"...
---
...a new day actually began one second before the cluster shutdown...
---
...and I [got my points](https://imgur.com/1wEIQqN)! :)
---
EVE twitch presence is GARBAGE!   like 50-200 top for 22-32k active users.... This is a key indicator of some type of problem.
---
Is that what happened in Dekline? The moral of all of EVE was destroyed? I will argue that the North is going to employ a much more successful "Fabian" strategy than Goons did. Seeing as how goons didn't succeed in anything when they got evicted.
---
Redeeming menu said +1 days over what was actually available because it rounded up.
---
&gt; So when Goons will burn every single keepstar and sotiyo the north own  you won't be one of those guy (like we had last war) "mimimimi CCP do  something goons are too powerful, nerf rorq, nerf super, delet goons" ? 
---
I was in Goonswarm too for quite some time, so no I won't cry about goons. 
---
&gt; That's the reason why I left goons to enjoy instead killing any single  PVE carebear who don't want to participate in any kind of pvp, or at  least stop krabbing for 2 month 
---
As I said, I left too and I know more than a few people that did the same. 
---
I really hope that this shitfest of structure grinding, blueballs and tidi finally shows ccp that their "exciting changes" they announce every few months have been the biggest pile of crap this game has experienced in a long time.... but boy my expectations aren't high
---
Take everything you see with a grain of salt. Recents events showed bots exists in goons too. I still wonder why no one shows in the graph provided by CCP.
---
Also lol frat.
---
I hate to be cliche, but even something like a battle royal could be created with the EVE client fairly quickly.  20-25 frigates with the lowest weapons roaming around a dedicated "anomaly" stealing loot from each other.... I like the sandbox of EVE, but to cater to a bigger audience some type of structured game play could go quite a long way and be a relatively low investment for the development team.
---
You seems to underestimate the effects of pride.
---
Having numbers doesn't mean you will react to it, care for it or believe it, we see that everyday in the real world.
---
What?
---
He means you hit caps lock to go to the next window and hit r to bring your drones in.
---
Eve ticks are ridiculously long so you can pull in multiple sets of drones on the same tick.
---
After downtime the event is over.
---
Flying a T1 Cruiser to run t3s require decent skillpoints and proper kiting
---
Hell, you could solo a T3 Electrical in a Retribution
---
Just use a Gila
---
Yeah this event is terrible and rewards all the wrong people (skill farmers and rorqual multiboxers), and does nothing to get people to actually log in and play.
---
It just shows how the players are as bad for the game as CCP's poor management of the game. All I hear all the time is bitching and complaining about the replacement mechanics for the previous mechanics. That are also hated, and used as an excuse for not fighting. Bunch of pixel clutching bitches.
---
It’s only addiction if you want to stop !
---
I am too heavily invested in turrets. Nearly all the Rattlesnake fits I've seen rely on missiles. Are they that good? Much more range? I can only lock on targets 84km away from me. I am a new player. I don't know much.
---
"Goons enjoy unopposed structure bashes" has to be the saddest thing I have ever heard someone in Eve say.
---
No. And hadn't been for about a decade. Only log in for pings.
---
I've never been on a redline fleet thank God.
---
1. If you need a public contract, you still need to get it from a citadel you can't dock in. Stop being dumb.
---
2. If by now you figured out you can stick a cheap alt in random corp x, it is too late now to start that shit. Stop being dumb. 
---
3. If you did, by some miracle, think of the above steps before you posted and are currently being up our "stocks", thanks for lining our pockets while we are deployed. You are still dumb. 
---
4. Seeing the 3 above points, we are renting out space in Pure Blind. You seem to be of the same cut as the people that are currently feeding titans and supers in Delve. We can always use more ~~retards~~  valued renters like you to fill our coffers up even more while not giving a single fuck if you lose your (insert whatever here) while the rest of the coalition is deployed and you have been told repeatedly via forums, jabber, discord and mumble to not do it while we are away on deployment.
---
What you are really saying: *assume snarky tone* You guys have too many people for others to assail, so I will pose a snarky question and call people pets in the hopes that my internet words hurt them where I cannot do so in game.
---
Do you really think botters use the same email for more than one account? That's like begging to get all accounts banned at once.
---
**Goon obession intensifies**
---
War is good for the game. Unspoken needed to remain in the spotlight so 3Tears can feel like he is still relevant.
---
Might be worth it of it meant Gobbins stopped posting.
---
I mean why be jealous of TAPI
---
But everything is set around DT and SP is cheap as chips tbf, what they need to address is the lack of Drifter Clones/Cloths and Drifter ship tree.
---
Any hybrid turrets not shooting Null should be considered as heretic

Look hockeystud87...I was still hs venture mining when dekline was a thing....so I can blindly talk shit all I want without giving a rip about weird non goon propaganda
---
Oh in thinking of John whiticker or something like that. Welp, I'll be sneaking out this way...
---
That's why the USA was founded
---
I thought they might do something like this so I warned my buddy from another game community to get his alpha sub saying the 19th in the US maybe the last day. to be fair I seen other game devs shut down their event on the last day they listed it as running so, I was,"AWOKE" when they pulled that on this event.
---
Will you be giving your stuff away or keeping for when you slink back on?
---
i would stop them and kill a nyx insted for example or maybe even a titan :)
---
I'll be putting it all on contract for 950 mil, but claim 9.5B and state that it's worth 29bil in dodixie later today.
---
People forget, goonswarm federation exists outside of eve. You cannot kill an organization that does not require in game methods of cultural cohesion.
---
You can burn down goonswarm repeatedly, until the servers finally go dark, and they will still be who they are.
---
&gt; the worst thing that could ever happen in the eyes of Goons
---
That means goons think it's bad.  Not really your meaning there.
---
Because we are bad at EvE .... Just ask anyone
---
&gt; Why not give the TCU a purpose and add depth to sov warfare
---
Because no one likes having two entosis fights over one system.  The TCU currently serves no real purpose (other than showing your alliance name on dotlan, and that's only because dotlan is outdated /u/Wollari ).  There should be one structure that decides official control of a system.
---
The weird spelling of Kredit is because the actual Icelandic currency is the Icelandic Krona, abbreviated as ISK. So CCP, the Icelandic company that makes EVE, named the in-game currency after it.
---
Kinda funny I guess... Im part of Init though so the culture I'm talking about isn't Goons but the coalition as a whole and Init.
---
How so ?
---
sir you misspelled "Void"
---
Whoever you get your code from, make sure you do use a referral code when making your account. Even if you've already been playing for a few days or weeks even, the difference in Skill Points you get from being recruited is huge. (750k free, a new character made without Recruit A Friend does not get any bonus skill points to start with.) I'd also recommend not spending this 750k free SP immediately until you have a basic understanding of the game.
---
"If you mine the minerals yourself they're free!"
---
Just classic
---
Noice. I've thought of doing a grand tour of K-space, but whenever I look at systems visited on the map I am reminded of the stories that took me there, and I don't want to lose that.
---
Goons haven't done anything to me. I just hate them out of principle, they're 1: Ruining the game, and 2: Are brainwashed shitheads who think they're part of something.
---
You misspelled 'dreadnoughts' twelve times in a row.
---
Void is also a type of Antimatter shots, better get back to the kiting meta
---
More like disappointed it doesn't have excavators. If you are going to pull a stunt like this, at last go all in.
---
Whats your favorite battleship?
---
Related question: I feel like it used to be possible to hold down a key so that you could doubleclick "through" your ship to get it to move in that direction. Am I just wrong about this or has it changed?
---
Rokh
---
&gt; Mar5meca 
---
I'm sorry, I can't find this character in game
---
"I can tell you to eat shit and die, fuck your echo chamber."
---
Better?
---
You aren't worth anything yet. Fit some bling on your ship, or start carrying a lot of valuable cargo, and you might be.
---
And with the Plex prices rising
---
\#feelsbadman
---
&gt; An average person writes at over 8 strokes per second, a setup that tabs with one key and recalls with another makes it possible to hit even more than 8 on one server tick.
---
You need at least 16 strokes/sec to achieve that (one to move window and one to recall).
---
Boop
---
we certainly are at geopolitical odds but i agree with every point you made.  great explanation.
---
These ones are more naughty.

it was a joke, stop taking yourself so... oh wait. space violence. yeah sperg away.
---
This entire thread is making me very uncomfortable but also excited.
---
The meta is what makes Eve unique, and I'd double down on it. Keep up regular Scope videos that weave meta politics into the lore, help fund and encourage weekly NER reports, analyze the tactics and intricacies of historic battles, etc.
---
Then couple that with a more robust social media presence and actual media relations to get more positive stories in PC Gamer, et al.
---
two in a row. six in each column.
---
I prefer the Field Marshal Jacket :p
---
yikes
---
So all the folks downvoting this, clearly have never seen Airplane.

N..nani?
---
The worst part for me is that usually events end on Tuesday not Monday. That's why I thought I could claim the last reward today. Was stuck on 15/16 today to riiiip.
---
I am heavy addicted. In the depths of my mind. I hope CCP shuts the game down.
---
I'd say that it'd be nice if my account was purged instead, but I know I'd be wanting to start again.

Started about 5 years ago. Steam says 14620 Hours. That's bit over 8 hours each day if divided by 1826. Granted steam counts launcher being online as "playing" and good amount spent idling/client forgotten on/autopiloting, but still an unhealthy amount :(

Hey look, im a mouth breathing fucking retard that cant quote properly too, look at me, lmao wow yeah look im smart

Idk. If I read 1 day left i would never assume that means &gt;24 hours so I would read 2 days as &lt;48

I'm glad I'm not the only one who was confused.

/u/ccp_falcon - Please tell us there is something in the works to fix this situation.
---
XD Unfortunitly, alot of those aren't what I'm looking for, since most of their "Beginner" fits are in the 200-300mil range. Maybe that's not to expensive if you're experienced with Deadspace, but just starting to learn that seems like a pretty big risk.
---
This isn't accurate at all, the titan count was within a few percentage points both times (the north had more the first fight, less the second).
---
Again, I get that the Gila is a good ship to use, but its to expensive to use as a learning tool that you're probably going to lose just starting out.
---
Just quit being a noob and trying to cut it last minute...
---
youre very rude mate
---
I've been saying this since the event started, but got nothing but downvoted into oblivion from the cucks that think pressing a login button every day like a good monkey makes them better somehow.
---
I play 2 hours every week because i am burned from the war. We are at war since I joined the alliance. Now I only do my weekly jobs in game every week
---
Gave out a concord skin for like 1 ship.
---
Because how good Gila is, you aren't going to easily lose it unless something went horribly wrong
---
For now.
---
Which is why I admit it's not a perfect system. But it's something, and there's not really anything CCP can do beyond that to prevent botters from taking advantage of an easier NPE. CCP just has to double down on what they're already doing to catch and get rid of botters.
---
I stopped reading after the lame excuse "it was a joke".
---
If they decide not to give me the rewards across my accounts, this'll be the last straw for me. Might finally win this stupid game.

I'd still rather not risk it, honestly, at least not until I understand what I'm actually doing. Once I get into the flow of things, I'll probably grab it up.
---
&gt;This summer goons kill NC, next summer they kill Horde, the year after that they betray and kill TEST.

These groups not being able to rebuild in a year is scary accurate.

Your leaders don’t care in NC/Pl they live off Casino War wealth, while their members all suffer. They fail to adapt to the Meta for the greater good. You made your beds now sleep in it. Hope we have good fights to come!

to be honest maybe i would consider playing eve more if it was on mobile
---
That's up to you, rewards always came with risk

Love some eve related gear, only homemade ones ofc

Load up tripwire of just google the name of the wormhole you jump into.

Try it and see.  You'll either hate it or love it.  It'll be easier to love if you make friends in-game though.  It's a very hard game if you're alone.

This line of events feels familiar

Pretty nice haul lad.
---
So, honestly, I wish this success in their target market. That market is China/Other Asian countries. Like someone else already said in this thread, this isn’t a game for the western world since we actually have standards. 
---
However, maybe if this one FINALLY takes off, maybe they can FINALLY start putting some more money into making things better.
---
... that or they’ll all-in on mobile and that’s how eve will die, but honestly, I can’t see many avenues of Eve ever becoming its former glory without some sort of external revenue since the execs are DEAD SET on diversifying their games portfolio. They will sooner drive the company into the ground than stop focusing on making new games.
---
So let’s wish them the best of luck far from the Western Hemisphere, and hopefully that they’ll use some of that income towards the experiences WE want. Because at this point that’s all we can do.
---
Yeah same here
---
Never too late to play, even if your time is short you will make memories

ah ok well my mistake then :)
---
My playbook says 2021 for The Initiative supremacy clause...
---
You can't explore afk with 20 toons at once though.
---
IMO having Alpha clones train at half speed is a terrible idea. The skill system already feels molasses slow to a brand new new who has no implants and is on the default skill mapping. Alphas are already severely limited in their capabilities, and the halved training rate hurts legitimate new players more than it does players using Alphas as alts or skillpoint farms. If SP farms are the main concern, just don't let alphas extract SP... but I'm sure that would be a very controversial change for some.
---
I also think that there is no reason to link starting SP to Recruit a Friend. If you make a character with RAF you start with three times more SP than if you do not. This also only hurts legitimate new players, or at least makes them feel bad upon realizing shortly after beginning the game that they have crippled their start by signing up for a new account the normal way, and thanks to half speed Alpha training that 750k SP is more than month's worth of training lost. Sure, they can make a new account, but now they have to biomass their original toon if they want to use the name again, and while none of their assets need to be lost (as they can all just be traded to a friend or another char), this whole process is not a good or fun experience.
---
It's kind of ridiculous that starting a new account "correctly" requires so much prior knowledge of the game, and the NPE ends up being a lot of "oh you should just start over with a RAF account even though youve played for 2 weeks already you will have more SP if you start over" or "oh you really can't do that much as an Alpha for a few weeks just log in to update your skill queue".
---
TLDR:
---
get rid of the slower Alpha training speed. Disallow Alphas from using Extractors if necessary, or some other limitation on SP farming with Alphas.
---
make the 750k SP from recruit a friend the norm for new accounts, don't tie it to RAF. RAF has plenty of other rewards that make it worth it already.
---
isnt this essentially the exact same post as we had a couple of days ago?

so you want them to change it to be like it is right now?

There's no fucking way getting clubbed would kill Horde.

&gt; Any tips for the first tip to the gym?
---
yeah, just go. do something, it doesn't matter what. stop worrying if it's good, or optimal, or any other bullshit. just go, and go the next day, and the next. build the habit. because if you don't go, the rest doesn't mean shit.
---
I just pay monthly fees for the gyms i'm a member of. one is a generic 24hr chain gym, the other has a cage and a lot of matted areas to grapple on.
---
if you're totally lost, go and read r/fitness wiki. i personally just do 5/3/1 for my weight lifting because it's so simple even some one who multiboxes rorquals like a monkey can follow it.

Yeah but it’s all equally boring so. 🤷‍♂️

we disavow useless people who gets pings, forums posts, corp mails and alliance meeting recordings all saying "If you undock a shiny from now on you will die and we will not save you" who then immediately proceed to undock a shiny and start gating it around and ratting/mining with it. The MER has its place, a war isn't one of them.

Wow guys, look how much menoth doesn't care! He's even made a post to tell us exactly how much he doesn't care!
---
Very good post!
---
they unanchored the station they were using to produce it.
---
Is there a way to see more than just the top 10 list of ships on the front page? I just started losing eve again and I'm curious what the latest fads are.
---
Look bro. Just because more Goon ships are going to die in the move op than in the actual fight up north don't mean shit. Ships dying is srsbsns.
---
actually its more like super and titan prices are so low at this point a lot of producers have stopped trying to sell what they have and are slowing down production because the margins are razor thin given the amount of time and effort they take to make. The more of these idiots that feed big shit in delve the better the prices will be for sellers when the war ends.
---
To be fair, there is a fair amount of salt to be enjoyed from watching one's opponents simply pull up their stakes and leave, even if it is not as satisfying as outright destroying the assets directly would be.
---
Goonswarm is going to spend the aftermath of this conflict enjoying the fact that "Already Replaced" isn't actually a joke for them, and that their latest target, NC., was so outmatched in material and manpower that they largely withdrew from the target zone rather than engage.  NC. will be able to enjoy the fact that they denied additional killboard entries to the Goonswarm by withdrawing, which does have benefits to the right type of player.  And everyone will argue about if PvE obsessed players count as deployable assets for Goonswarm, or just flavor for the region.
---
&gt;stop taking yourself so... oh wait. NC.
---
I see you don't care it so much you have to cut 15 min of your pornhub time creating the meme pic and post it on reddit to show you don't care.
---
The North doesn't stand a chance.
---
Init have been planning this for over 4 years.
---
you've clearly never seen the 1dq1 local channel when super builders are trying to unload their stockpile. Some guy went so far as to start putting up bulk super contracts of 10 at a time because selling them one at a time was taking too long.
---
hahaha I mean i'm personally hoping to loose a bunch of the ships I'm taking north. They have been siting gathering dust for far too long!
---
stock up on blood raider LP tho, the new implants are gonna be worth it. VNI ratting is for choobs.
---
that sounds like a lot of effort.
---
you'd think so but nah.

well only about 5 min... but its 5 min of porn ill never get back :'(

Who knows, maybe CCP will do something nice and hook up the 15/16 people

I accidentally gave the wrong tune the EXP. I submitted a ticket in hopes that the GM's can help transfer back to the other tomb.

I have ships in 10 different stagings. I wouldn't mind using them all and losing them. Clean up the hangars..

Same situation man. I work a demanding job and I feel like the "rules" were ambiguous enough that people are now debating them. I feel a little bit miffed. I mean I don't necessarily blame it on anyone but it still stings, I was really looking forward to those skillpoints.

Long winded, but still likely true.  To me, that is the most amusing part of all of this.

Watching all of the posturing from the sidelines is going to be quite entertaining for the next few weeks, at least for me.
---
You gotta pump those numbers up. Those are rookie numbers.
---
A Smartbomb is too close range to do this and a bomber has to have some sick skills to pull that off (remember a bomb has to take some time to fly to you) and most gatecamps dont include a bomber so you're pretty safe from that regard
---
Credit card

it's actually nice when you have only 150m sp because that saved 6b in skill injectors

hey guys look at goons trying to make it look like they haven't messed up and fed the bears to rest of eve.......see nobody cares.
---
Guess I’m stuck in the past lol

Just posting here to say same thing happened. CCP needs to at least give a statement as this is obviously not a small portion of the players.

just rent a system in Omist and get a few bots

At times I feel like I’m the only person who isn’t bothered and having a blast, but that could be because I have been playing for less than a year.
---
Valar dohaeris.
---
Init been planning and trying but had a  fail deployment. That turn into we just deployed for good fights.
---
But they know they can’t take on NC. With Goons and friends.
---
It probably takes you half of that to finish, so not a big loss..
---
I'd like to see ncpl move 4k+ cats and not lose any to dumb shit in the process.
---
you do know bwf is like one of main sources of pvp fights for roaming fleets for alot of groups in eve and some go daily just to get content without fail why would goons ruin that when they bring fleets in 3 or 4 times a day to get kills or feed
---
Only a few?
---
Hello, I would like to insure this battleship for more than it is worth. Also it is fitted with the cheapest mods and just enough ammo for 6 cycles. So what if the last 5 only lasted 10 minutes, not my fault.
---
Yep I'm doing the same. If I don't get those skillpoints from the support ticket I filed or other means than It's time to take a little break.
---
Ships are siting there. Because you suck at solo pvp?
---
The ”day” ended at eve-time 11:00 so in this case two days meant 35 hours, which means we’re missing 9.
---
I did not assume a full 48 hours, I assumed I had 24 and change when in actuality I had less than 24.
---
"Already replaced" kind of embodies how stupid people view this game and wars in general
---
sure maybe you replaced it. sure maybe you had the isk to do so easily, or it was SRP'd. Regardless it has diminished your finite resources, even if a small amount. No one kills a ship or a structure and thinks "good, we'll never see that pilot in that ship ever again" unless it's a rare or exotic ship. Saying something is "already replaced" is completely missing the point of blowing shit up in eve.
---
I care
---
&gt; I never said we never kill people under the umbrella. Given your list, it boils down to the degree of brain-deadery you have exhibit to die in Delve. As of right now, it's too high. As a result, only 3% of all farm converts to killmails. I argue whaling should be buffed until this ratio is around 15%s. 
---
I reckon the real trick is going to be not tanking gameplay for people who don't have an umbrella, or have a shitty umbrella.
---
Adding more to your umbrella should be empowering, but asymptotically so. That way the little guys don't have to fold into superblocs to exist! But I frankly have no idea how such a system would look.
---
what makes you think he doesn't jerk off to Jurassic Park

I had a carrier within 10 months of starting EVE back in 2012... You are only a newbro if your corp / alliance treats you like one.
---
pic or it didn’t happen?
---
Also: raise a ticket with CCP. They should be able to help.
---
Why do you have to sell the toon? If it’s for SP, you can extract that?
---
Anyone who want to organize and maintain a coalition on the scale of Goonswarm or its peers is signing on to a full time job, to be perfectly honest.  You are trying to corral swarms of ~~cats~~ players into moving vaguely in the same direction, or at least not working actively against your goals.  One consequence of this is the fact that anyone leading such a group will not, in general, be focusing their time on direct gameplay, such as idle PvE or roams for laughs.  The opportunity cost of such things would be extreme.
---
Ok? I was in PL for 7 years and spent 2-3 of them playing with Horde. There was no way we were going to beat GOONS 2v1, even after the Saranen debacle. 
---
Brave had basically no capital/super fleet, 1/3 the membership, and we managed to recruit most of their active FC's/leaders/titan pilots (Into PL). Brave, at its height, had nothing even resembling the organization or the quality of leadership that Horde did/does on its worst day. Their best leaders were Blue Ice and W Rush, who iirc were both in high school, and regardless, had virtually no idea what they were doing. If PL wasn't responsible for Horde failcascading, someone else would have been. There really is no valid comparison. 
---
Also, PL didn't and still doesn't exist to be some diametrically anti-GOONS organization, despite whatever you might think. In fact, it's a largely apolitical actor, with goals dictated by whomever is currently steering the ship. It's always existed to give its members the best quality game (In their eyes anyways), which is why over the years they've worked with almost everyone on the map to one extent or the other to accomplish their goals. Hunting GOONS while not getting paid to do it sounds like a great way to risk everything to gain nothing. You seem to be under some crazy impression that PL was actually risking something to go seal-clubbing Brave: they weren't and it was always only about easy content. Had Brave killed a single PL titan, the seal-clubbing would have stopped immediately and PL would have fled to a different part of the map to go seal-clubbing there.

I was. At one point I was 6-8 hours / day. Burned out for three years, being very careful about how I come back.
---
Glad you got them at least.  CCP should really handle this stuff better
---
Yeah this, unless it's a specialized character with expensive assets like titan skill books or HG implants characters are really not worth that much more than "melt value"
---
I mean these are all fleet fit ships sooo... but also if i sucked at solo pvp wouldn't I just have a ton of losses and no ships? lol
---
Oh, be nice.  It is fun to watch the nonsense from outside.

CCP is actively supressing comments in that thread.  I posted there around 2 hours ago, and my post was ”hidden pending moderator approval”.  I followed all the community guidlines and the TOS woth my post.  I felt it was respectful enough but it never got unhidden.

They cant even extract 40 man nightmare fleets without leaving sleeping people behind :P
---
&gt; In fact, it's a largely apolitical actor, with goals dictated by whomever is currently steering the ship.

That's pretty apparent.  And now you're going to get the same results as people who "aren't interested in politics".

haha true

Was that lasers on a hurricane?

Exploring is insanely popular at least in my area.... Pretty much the only traffic I see is 30 person fleets or lots of explorers. My only complaint with the hacking game is the random unfair element is the only difficulty - like just hitting 3 of the half your power ones in a row you just can't win...
---
This happened to me as well, I logged in and got no rewards for the last day. Luckily, I had all the rewards for previous days. I also submitted a ticket to CCP, I'll give updates on how that goes, but so far I've been waiting for like 8 hours for an answer
---
Sorry But it seems you have an insufficient number of iron coins
---
I’m assuming the real reason he needs to copy a characters face is different than the stated purpose above.
---
That wasn't a failed deployment. It's sole purpose was to test the North's response, and they succeeded.
---
Easy. You need counters to the umbrella and you need to nerf people's ability to cram so many farmers under the same umbrella. This is why my most mentioned proposals are mobile cyno inhibition rework and further anom rework.
---
So you’d rather krab so you can be omega, so you can krab some more and stay be omega... dumb

You need to have your shell smashed :p

And you get something out of referal yourself. Quite alot iirc.

I’d be interested in it too. So far my industry alt is training for some scanning and sabre skills.

The hacking game can be very frustrating sometimes, and I would quite enjoy a new update on it, but I still quite like it.

I actually kind of enjoy the minigame. It could use some more spice to it but that kind of thing while you're also watching for hunters is probably why you won't see many other people pushing for something like that...

Look, she is gorgeous and I can't get any duplicates right. I just want to copy her face and that's it.

The Mittani works on Eve full time? How does he afford food, housing, etc?

Don't kid yourself. It'll just be either new renter landlords, or expansions by existing ones nearby.

I mean I'd love nothing more than to be wrong, but I know I'm not.

We dont know it was them until we saw the killmail. First was… "LOL 5b Occator"… then, we see who it was and... "Oh, Fuck…" Was one of that Eve moments XD

And yeah, they are friking good doing what they do. True must be said. its a cool exp, learning A LOT as our noses bleed.

Not more HS krabing for us. We still have some shit there, will endure as long as we can. Every day getting our faces smashed is equal to months of experience in HS. (maybe more)

Some of those BPs aren't worth building, if you add up the cost of mats and look at the sell prices.  Also one of the reasons it's hard to shift the contracts for them.  So make sure you spreadsheet it before you buy the mats.

I just mean more - allow people to get into ships faster, but master them a slower rate - just a suggestion - its a complicated task and I am by no means an expert, but I found this approach does not benefit a bot, but does benefit new players.

Bear in mind, you should also be aware that Thera's HS exits can also be camped, especially if one pops up close to a trade hub. Eve Scout maintain the list of WHs into Thera at :  [https://www.eve-scout.com/thera/](https://www.eve-scout.com/thera/)

I don't even care about the big ships, If you gave me enough SP and ISK to fly one, I would extract it and train it into as many characters as I need to make my own fleet of WH ratting Nestors.

Even under the best of circumstances, you are usually wasting developer's time with too many meetings and if you don't have the devs there you end up with ridiculous decisions being made.

They're pretty awesome. But the ammo is ridiculously overpriced. It costs more for a single shot than it does a whole pile of ammo for any other gun.

There's no way to copy (or 'clone') a character of which I am aware.
---
However, if you use the 'Capture Portrait' function, and reset the portrait several times at different angles (noting the lighting and pose settings, plus the make-up etc settings) you can use these to go into a new character screen and replicate the portrait. Take a screen shot of your original character in the Character screen if you can.
---
The character creator is quite difficult to fine tune, but most of the character races have fairly limited options. Replicating a character is extremely fiddly and takes a lot of patience. Note that the lighting and pose settings are very important in getting the replicated portrait to look right - the correct face will look very different in the different lights, and even intensities.

Why would you want to be in NC.? 
---
Their capitals were getting smashed by Provi's battleships, so they had to drop supers. They aren't good pilots, they just have a lot of high end ships.
---
i'm not sure what the hell happened to the 1m SP bonus but i logged into my account today and did not get it. i have gotten it for every single day except for this one. i wasn't like researching the time, i would simply login every single day and claim my prize. today i went in to claim it and the whole screen was gone. what gives?
---
honestly i am deactivating. so many things in this game feel bad but this just takes the cake. that's like a month worth of training time that was randomly taken away from me when i did what i was supposed to like everyone else.

Multitasking, you can watch porn while making memes

Hey, I lost a few ships in A.D until I got a Gila. I'm still pretty new and responsibly low skilled, even so, the Gila clears T1,T2 very quickly. I run the Dark sites in my fit. Usually finish in about with plenty of time to spare. I really didn't want to lose a Gila so I put it off for months. But now I actually have finished so many runs in it , it is very clear it is an amazing ship for Abyssals. My fit is below, I run the Dark sites very quickly.

It truly is the end for panfam. We are doomed! DOOMED~~!! How will we ever recover?

If you think the stakes are so high and you're gonna sperg out about missing the last day's reward, why let it get down to the last day? Just redeem earlier and give yourself a margin for error rather than hulking out at CCP

You're complaining that you didn't get the log-in rewards for a game you don't log in to? Wat

Yeah, they really bottled necked the cost of all these Trig. specific items with the two components in Abyssal sites.

What about increasing the physical distance between null regions to at least 7LY. This would also apply to null&gt;lowsec. Make the geography matter more, and create key bottleneck systems.

The virus suppressors are literally the worst.

What's the cooldown on it? Make it so it constantly spams the fleet chat of any fleet in local, annoying the hell out of the fleet.

As an abyssal spammer. Huzzah.

Well it even says 2 hours left on campaign in the screenshot so it should still give it to you regardless of downtime.

Can ccp promise to never do this shit again. I mean a million sp? and how many days can you miss? 90% of the sp in this event is on the last day. i had to go out of town and now i miss most of the whole event. we get shitty empty ones that literally dont give you anything or firecrackers, but then the last day has one million fucking sp. CCPlease spread out the sp more evenly in the future, i feel like im being blackmailed instead of being rewarded for playing.

I can help with this if you can get me side and front shots of the characters head.

Having played since 2004, i left in 2016 and i've still got that itch to come back.
---
I rejoined a corp, have undocked and floated about a bit, mostly just market traded, but still looking for that "pull" back into the game wholeheartedly
---
between '04 and '16 i played it almost constantly, been to fanfest a few times, made some lifelong friends, then it kinda felt like i'd done everything, so i concentrated on RL... and now, it's difficult to get back into it.    
---
my old corp is filled with loads of people i don't know and who don't know me, most of the people i do know are directors or have left to do other things in other corps/alliances, or have simply won EVE for good.         
---
But it's always there, that feeling of _"i could get back into it"_ or _"lets just login and do something"_ 
---
especially on sunny days off, where i'd run around and pew people whlie talking to nerds, fleet up with them and take out random shit, but most of the time now, i'll have a look at discord, or reddit, login and trade some shit, then leave.

Look out boys we got a ISI violation someone get the reddit OSHA here.

You say that but I honestly see no reason as to why this wouldn't work. It's like it has become a member to shit of botting solutions. How about instead of being a meme, contribute something constructive to the conversation?
---
&gt; I just hate that everything is now based around log-in bonuses
---
This is literally the second time they've ever done this. What do you mean everything? This doesn't detract in any way from the time(s) you can log in, it's just an added bonus for people who could.
---
Does photo op on assembly line every 1-2 years.... sounds about right :D
---
I understand why you would suggest this but I think this would only infuriate the player base. At that point, your bots would become FoF Ravens or praxises rather than vnis.

I just offload my exploration loot to the manufacturing guy in my corp. I think its too much to devote a character to unless you are already down that path from my understanding.
---
I can understand for NC/PL line member since they are not here to do krabing all the day but to do pvp and make kb green, but they had PH and a lot of renter they could have used for this purpose, PH could have been the new karma, check karmafleet titans number it's incredibly high, thanks to injector and rorqual mining, a carebear can become a titan pilot in 3 years

In the industry of spaceship deconstruction, I see!

kikimora: awesome. squishy, but sick dps and very strong in small gang + sees some use in fleet warfare (with booshers). 
---
vedmak: meh. brawl with it if you want, average-ish.
---
drek: awesome, not squishy, great dmg with a range bonus. still a BC, can't project past 50k which limits their use in fleets.

Yeah I feel bamboozled too.  Missed logging in last night due to GoT Finale.  Well, at least I logged in every other day of the giveaway.  On previous calendar giveaways, didn't CCP award all missed prizes to subbed customers on request ?  I seem to remember doing this via ticket 5 or 6 years ago.. imma givin it another shot now :D
---
In regards to the small turret... its tracking is second to none, it eats interceptors for breakfast. A major reason why the Kikimora is so good imo.
---
are they tho
---
I could see them killing our Keeps to put us in our place but i don't think they want us to go away.

You're super mad, trust, we heard you.

Can't you look at a bookmark in space to prevent this ???

Honestly, I kinda like the minigame. It's like a sci-fi sort of minesweeper. I'd be sad to see it changed.

I like where they chose war of attrition 3 years after the stockpiles are remade.
---
In my guess, the locusts in delve will run out of materials faster than the super capital fleet will run out of super capitals.
---
Depends on how much of a genuine weapon you'd want it to be.  Spamming local would be an annoyance.  Spamming fleet (and intel) chats of everyone in a given system could be quite a bit more powerful.
---
The guy streaming did this, it's just that there was a moment of vulnerability after looking at a Titan that docked and his view reset revealing where he was. Then they used a screenshot of that moment of vulnerability to track down where he was using distances and star positions.
---
dude couldnt properly fit an atron.

You got that good koolaid son.

RMT, life threats in a wizard hat etc.

People are amazing.... I never even thought that would be possible but I guess with a known distance it just takes time and practice

Bulk exotic dancers, Male for sale

Lol, why would they?  You don't need a creative director to do login bonuses, tick checkboxes for login metrics, and push monetization.

Yeah you're mad, trust, we heard you.

Amazing work! Love the video! :) Congrats and well done.
---
Yes.
---
Please help.
---
I've taken a few ships south to lose. It's quite nice in delve, the content is so close.
---
Pretty impressive too, considering he was 4500km from the point of reference.
---
I mean, a T2 fit Gila is effectively impossible to lose in a T2, so if that's what you're gonna use later on, may as well start there.
---
But it is.  Explo sites are theorized to have 0 re-spawn time, meaning they can in theory be farmed very efficiently.

You can join NSH and interact with him on a daily basis.

thats the screenshot that was used to find him

Wally is currently marked as Kill on Sight for Pan Dam and he is on the top of the north's "no-fun list"
---
Definitely set your standards high I see.
---
My experience is that the constellation is jammed until downtime after the incursion is cleared.
---
He was looking at my Hel, I docked my hel and then took that screenshot.
---
I don’t think anyone is saying they did it intentionally.  People can still call them out for doing something shitty on accident though.
---
You can’t unachor a person bob.
---
Nice myspace angle on the Aeon.
---
Hi Wally
---
Yeah - I get it now. Using the fleet position from the structure, the known distance it was just an issue of patience to line up the big stars.... Thanks for posting this.
---
It clearly didn’t though, and that happened to others.  It’s because you can only get one login reward per downtime ans the downtime on the 20th is 11:00 Eve time, which means that when the timer said 2 days it really meant 1.4 days and anyone who was banking on getting the rewards on the 20th got fucked.
---
But then I couldn't use the wormhole tag smh
---
Have they truly descended to the level of panfam? Sad times.
---
Actually getting NC. to unanchor all their shit before the announcement of an invasion even happened let alone the actual invasion is a pretty good story to. As I said either you can say NC. doesn't care about it and which case you have to take goons don't care about the loses at home or both matter and you have to account for both.

The very fact that it gives you answers starting with Aza shows that it doesn't work.  \[A-Za-z\] would get you literally everything starting with any letter if it were interpreted as a regex.

dont be shit at the game
---
Don't.
---
mercenary-style gameplay in eve is dead
---
How about joining an established corp and learning some things before trying to create something with little knowledge or experience. Im all for trying new things and taking the hard road, but when it comes to corps in eve, inexperienced leadership makes for bad corps that do nothing and fall apart pretty quick
---
I have quite a big of experience on this front and happy to have a more in depth conversation in game. At a high level...
---
To do this right takes a lot of effort and relationship building. There are a few core groups that have weathered time, but so many of flamed out. I'd say the average up start rarely makes it past 3 months.
---
Those that remain have more of a  villain perspective as it produces more content for the members.
---
You'll frequently be asked to defend against the established blocks which you'll likely lack the ability to contend with for a long time.
---
Content costs isk and good content costs lots of isk.
---
It can be a rich and enjoyable gaming experience, but there is a feast or famine to it. Happy to talk more.
---
I'm the CEO of a small industry-focused wormhole corp, so I have a little experience in this regard.
---
If you're a "novice player", my advice to you when creating a corp is simple: Don't. All that you're going to get is pain and misery. Join a corp that specialises in or near the thing you want to and spend some time learning how things are done and how such a corp is run. Once you have enough understanding of how such an organisation is run, then go ahead and start your own thing. In this regard, it's kind of a "if you have to ask you aren't ready" situation.
---
Beyond that, my next advice is to make sure you're good at what your corp is trying to do. The CEO should *never* have to say, "I can't fly that doctrine". Also make sure you have a lot of starting ISK, a few billion should do. Nobody who is anybody is going to join a corp that doesn't have a few structures it can access, unfortunately, and good structures get expensive.
---
Bear in mind that as a CEO you're going to be spending a lot less time directly playing the game and a lot more time managing your corp, doing diplo, leading fleets, and keeping the wheels turning. It takes time, effort, and supreme patience to build a corp up to a decent level and until you do it's going to be pretty disheartening.
---
Also keep in mind that reputation is everything when it comes to diplomacy, and it's going to take a while for you to build up enough of a reputation that big clients are going to hire you. You're going to be spending months or years running dinky 2-3Bn contracts for small mining corps that don't know how to deal with wardecs.
---
TL;DR: If you have to ask this question you probably have nothing but disappointment to look forward to. Join an established corp and learn from other people. Being a CEO royally sucks and it turns EVE into a job. But if you have the will to do it, it can be rewarding in its own right.

If you want to chat and such, feel free to DM me on Reddit.

You're missing out dude. I recommend binding it to right-click and setting the response-time to almost instant.

---
elite what now? :)
---
&gt;!just kidding I know what it is.. tempting offer, I might consider it!&lt;
---
So it's Darwinism?
---
Nope. It was all waypointed by hand. Painstakingly.
---
The one time I tried to optimize the waypoints was through EVE's built-in optimizing system thingermabobin. It literally has an aneurysm when it witnesses over 100 systems, so you can imagine how that ended up.
---
It's the thing that all of these "Adapt to the meta" posts miss. If your option as a group comes down to doing something the group doesn't want to do, people will leave the group or quit the game.
---
I can point to every time PL became a sov holding alliance that had to defend space, it caused the alliance to suffer and get worse, and ended in us losing supercap battles.
---
So yeah, the alliance leadership could have done things differently. But they also would not have likely had an alliance left to do things differently with.
---
I thought it was Darwinism in Querious?
---
devoted masochist here
---
Jokes aside, I rarely used the radial menu in my time through EVE. Maybe I'll start using it more.
---
And who’s faults that ?
---
I’m just a line member and F1 monkey but from my perspective NCPL deploy their fleet, Goons decide hey let’s glass tribute, deploy their fleet and then whinge, bitch, moan and complain they only have structures to bash.
---
Maybe next time don’t deploy to a region that’s not undefended ?
---
This is why it will be sucessfull.
---
Hilmar should go down in History as the dude that had a killer breadwinner,  that literally pissed it all away into failed projects.
---
I'm pretty sure that gate should lead from Stain... for the lulz.
---
Missed a bunch of mine by a day too.  The event feels really bad honestly; should have made it so that the 1 million SP were an end of event gift if you logged in like 2/3rds of the days or something.
---
:'(
---
Interceptors for the win.
---
Only on how much human blood you would need to farm for the bloody hands skin.
---
Imagine gloating about warping off because you put stabs on a ratting VNI, you are VNI ratting so you already lost even if he gets no kills his still better off
---
That's fair, but if I'm posting a sign Thursday morning I'm putting up a sign that says 2 days left. That sign will be up until Friday morning, and on that day I'll say last day
---
Yule lads was the best eve event of all time imo, and I'll fight whoever disagrees
---
Wonder what proportion of those reading this comment get it. I love Bill O.
---
Let's just say you're the leader of an elite space guild full of dudes who are there to blow up space pixels. You say to your dudes "Hey I have the ability to see the future, so what I'd like you to do is spend the next 6 months grinding structures in Delve to make sure goons don't rebound!", and your line members tell you to fuck off because that's not elite space PVP.
---
I mean you could tell them to do it, but you would be without a space alliance pretty fucking quick. EVE is still a game at the end of the day, and if you're not providing the content your guys want, you won't have your guys for long. 
---
It's why speculating over what PL should or should not have done after the war is a pointless endeavor. PL leadership did what they had to do to provide the kind of content that PL members wanted. Nothing more or less.
---
So a week or two ago I was wondering, "What's the absolute dirt cheapest ship I can fly into the Abyss with and not die?"  
---
And I came up with a Stabber fit.
---
`[Stabber, Already Replaced]`
---
`Damage Control II`
---
`Gyrostabilizer II`
---
`Tracking Enhancer II`
---
`50MN Quad LiF Restrained Microwarpdrive`
---
`Large Shield Extender II`
---
`Medium Shield Booster II`
---
`Medium Cap Battery II`
---
`220mm Vulcan AutoCannon II, EMP M`
---
`Light Missile Launcher II, Mjolnir Fury Light Missile`
---
`Medium Anti-EM Screen Reinforcer I`
---
`Medium Anti-Thermal Screen Reinforcer I`
---
`Acolyte II x5`
---
25 million ISK. Waltzes through T2 Electrical sites without breaking a sweat. Probably doesn't even need awesome skills. The one I fly bears the name "Already Replaced" because it paid for itself after the second site I did with it.
---
I made this after trying a RLML Caracal and absolutely hating it because reload.

How much for those curious ones

I thought of that to 15/16 days, but I guess not, when CCP is trolling me that hard \^\^ #CCPlease SP o/

brilliant nested fleet comps like an onion, layer after layer of force multipliers.

Second to him imho, is Vince Drakon of NC. one of the original Boosher fleet designers.

Third, despite his faults as an alliance/coalition leader, is Sort Dragon, who brilliantly held the line in BR- near nigh unto downtime in his Ereubus under constant heavy fire from  N3, NCDot, PL, and others.
---
And it’s all yours.

No, there was still no content. Do you honestly think they would have defended any of that shit? They would have just sat in lowsec and continued to wait, and both sides would have bled activity for months. In all likelihood the coalition would have imploded before goons did given how loosely tied together it was. The war was over, goons lost very decisively, the contract isk was no longer coming in, literally the only reason to continue would have been for pure spite. Why would they do that when they could find more active content much closer to home.
---
Sure looking back on it, maybe panfam is thinking "we probably should have gone after them", but at the time it was a very sensible decision to make.

Train things faster

I'm fairly certain sort did not have an erebus in BR-...

Items have a training time multiplier which you can see in the "info/attributes of the skill book

Was right underneath him all night even after he finally went boom

It used to be a thing, a long time ago.  The biggest instance of this was ISS - they sold shares to build 0.0 stations and seed the markets on those stations, then distributed the profits from the action to the shareholders.  Eventually, they got welped pretty hard - but it wound up being a good profit for the folks who got in from the beginning.
---
There were several other corps/people who copied the concept, and there even was a kind of stock-exchange website that was used for it - but most were scams, roleplay, or just failed right out the gate.
---
It is not a thing anymore.
---
I can always appreciate a good troll and a guy who really tries. Cheers to both of you! ^_^

intardasting. thxfc.

Just train for missiles. To be completely honest, you'd still be alright if you meta 4 the missiles. It just does so much more dps. I guess you can try a Machariel or rail Vindi but they are generally slower to clear rooms. A Leshak also isn't a bad option. 
---
Also about missiles. They always apply to rats. A cruise rattle can pull 110km range. Drones apply better than a single salvo of arty or rails.
---
I only flew under him once many years ago (or maybe he was just in fleet, I can't remember) but that time with vile rat was pretty good as I recall. O7
---
YOU AGAIN. bro my last 2 shipyards were at 0. shits fuckin aids

'Ave thou seen t' Grand Master?

Maybe we are talking about different fights
---
As a newbro, is a faction warfare corp/alliance a good place to get my start? Am I missing out on a lot by not trying to get straight into null or WH space?  
---
I like the idea of living out there but this FW PVP path seemed like a great way to get involved fast.
---
I feel like they should do something different for the relic one but otherwise, I dont see a huge need to change it.
---
this is retardedly complex. i logged in every day in the morning and got my prize for the last day. today i logged in and the screen was gone entirely.
---
I've heard rumors of someone impersonating famous FCs to get easy kills, and their name was near identical and had the same identical portait.
---
Same, sucked hard...
---
nope this same shit happened to me. logged in everyday to get my reward from the last day. and logged in this morning and the whole fucking screen was gone. unbelievable.
---
\*mission accomplished\*
---
What does this one do?

Go try it out on sisi. Nothing risked. Just about the only thing that could go wrong in a Gila in a t3 is to go out of bounds with it.
---
What does this one do?
---
It's Vince **Draken** btw
---
Stabs did not used to actually have those penalties, they were widly regarded as a mistake, and at the time it certainly was as it was quite cancery. However nowadays where solopvp is nowhere near like the old days I wonder what would happen if it was reverted, could be just as bad though dunno :P
---
he was almost certainly vni ratting before anyway :p
---
Always like to fly with Seleene from BDCI
---
This is footage of our side when we caught him:

Seddos Mom has got it goin on. she fucks wales all day
---
his ticks were still inevitably better than whatever the goon trying to catch him was getting op success
---
nevar forgive, nevar forget
---
It's for the EVE Russia, to commemorate some battle.
---
Yeah I hear they're doing great.
---
Lot of bad information in this thread.
---
The Training Rate is how fast you are training that skill in skill points. This is what determines the "time remaining" on a skill, not the other way around, nor are they independent values. Time remaining is a direct measure of how long until your SP/Minute completes the skill.
---
The training rate of a skill is determined by your Attributes. All skills have a Primary attribute and a Secondary attribute, and the forumula is very simple: Primary + Secondary/2 = SP/Minute. [Example from one of my characters.](https://i.imgur.com/G7J3Ip4.png) Primary is 31, secondary is 25, training rate is 31+(25/2) = 43.5, as shown in the screenshot. To get a value of 15 you must be an Alpha account, because it is not possible to actually get your attributes that low. (17 is the lowest possible attribute value, 17+(17/2)=25.5)
---
In the situation you are describing, the tooltip shows you exactly twice the time it is actually taking you to train. Did you just recently upgrade from Alpha to Omega? Or that particular tooltip is bugged and showing Alpha time instead of Omega time, would be my guess.
---
I am the proud owner of that same screen shot : (
---
Doing it rn
---
I do recall seeing the math and on the "single murder to world war 2" scale, it was about Game of  Thrones.
---
Nope. I play at work most of the time while waiting for something to happen. I'm the owner so it's ok.
---
Based off current attributes you have (memory, charisma, etc) that is how fast you work towards that skill.
---
That's why you use a detached camera for things like this.
---
oooo well damn. o well. came to see if anything cool was happenin here, guess ill just piss off the bots a bit more.
---
didnt realize there was an eve russia. makes moar sense now
---
By the time goons get to the "target systems" there won't be a delve left to go back to.
---
I lost interest in EVE last year when CCP announced how ansiblex gates work. I have been playing very casually since then.
---
Nice one! i'm impressed
---
I have not upgraded from Alpha to Omega, and I am just wondering why does the skill originally says 2 hours, 35 minutes, and 18 seconds. But:  [https://i.imgur.com/78ulWP7.png](https://i.imgur.com/78ulWP7.png)  says otherwise. Also what does training rate mean?  
---
I am asking if the training rate means it consumes skill points.
---
Imagine being a goon and reaching for scraps
---
By the sounds of things it looks like the goal of this camping is to choke off ISK revenue for the renters in the area, and no doubt demonstrate their landlords inability to defend the area. And despite not getting any kills the dude seems to be achieving that in your case.
---
Yeah I read about it on a thread a few weeks ago. Supposedly they(Russians) got backed into that one system and held off the attackers against overwhelming odds for a few days or something like that. I don't know any details but it seemed super epic
---
I just explained that to you. Please read my post again.
---
In my opinion, the last great merc group was Mercenary Coalition. At their prime, when they entered your systems, you knew that you were screwed. Years ago, I fought them in Deklein, it was one hell of a lot of fun. We lost, but I learned.
---
&gt; Imagine gloating about warping off
---
You had me lmfao with that statement alone. Everything else was icing.
---
think of the kiki as a confessor that's in propulsion and sharpshooter mode at the same time, and it has 5x the tracking
---
So burn delve is go? Got it.

Or git gud and spend an hour irl and just pay for your sub.
