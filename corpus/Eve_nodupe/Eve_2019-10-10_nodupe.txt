So are you ever going to fix the glitch that allows rorquals to mine out of siege with bonus - or multiply their drone values exponentially? I submitted a bug report a week ago and haven't even gotten a "we're looking into it."

---
in irrelevant quantities, yeah
---
I was asking about that part because it's important for us to be speaking the same language in order to converse.  If you're not interested in doing that homework, though, then we have nothing to talk about at this point.
---
Was it ever gone?   I don't think so.
---
What crazy alpha botter that expects his account to be banned sooner or later would actually pay real money for it.
---
Then how would I know what to complain about on Reddit? After all, I’m extremely loved here.
---
Yet in the other threads you are not so friendly.
---

---
I am, indeed, surprised.
---
I am waiting for CCP to give in entirely. You will know it happened when the sig reads $$$-500.
---
Why did you not clear them as you went with all that coherence remaining!
---
You have no one to blame but yourself.
---
ur retard. i haven't posted here or browsed here in a long time. get off hamster wheel idiot!
---
You don’t need multiple MTUs.  Drop one. Rat. Scoop loop. Scoop MTU. Warp to next site.  Rinse and repeat.
---
im just trying to see what's going through ur brain at this point
---
That seems like an unnecessary amount of fuel.
---
Do what every other B-Team and lazy A-Team group does, look at killboards from successful groups and steal their fleet fit :D
---
Its helpful if you actually understand how it works while your stealing it though.
---
Sad!! Bitter boomer can't let go of good old memories but too jaded to Live The Good Life! EVE Online is THE MOST FUN it has Ever been. If only angsty quitters could see!
---
@Hackerman
---
I didn't even run it. I was skirred
---
Exactly and we all know where that is going to lead.
---
its not, this is the one thing they are doing right only years later. The rest is a fucking mess. Youd think with a csm packed full of pvpers they could focus a bit more on the pvp things that need to be ballanced or fixed but even with a peanutgallery of whos popular they cant get shit sorted. But thats pretending like csm is of any use to begin with.
---
Well, not all of them:
---

---
Guidance systems was borderline free isk. I remember buying a bunch and it pretty much made eve easy mode since that free isk turned into more isk and so on.
---
Incredibly bad taste to lead fleets against people you just left, in my opinion.
---
I have no idea how to help you with AdBlock issues, sorry...
---
These are rookie numbers. Use a warp speed bonused ship at least.. wtf
---
What if he isn't a bad FC just.. a spy to spy on Goons :P
---
Wouldnt call a widely shared deep safe a fantastuc one, personally.
---
 How much bandwidth does it use a month?
---
Its maybe the second thing people would think about when it comes to insane deep safes. Upwell, then abyss.
---
Literally happens in any game when something like this happens. Stop QQ'ing because you cant make invulnerable citadels
---
Dude you have no clue what youre talking about.
---
I am guessing because you joined NC there was a opening?
---
Seriously fuck pirat, most toxic shitheads in the game. But all their shit down and black list every member from all corps in the future
---
If CCP is stupid enough to ban squizz, then 90% of the players will stop playing in protest. There will be no meaning to EVE anymore. How else are we supposed to stroke our space epeen?
---
People don't have to have a better idea to recognize a bad one.
---
&gt; Domis can seriously wreck people if you fit and fly them well
---
the Domi is the BEST T1 battleships for brawls, it can mess w/ Pirate and T2 ships and ive seen Solo Domis 1v1 Leshaks and come out on top
---
Absorbs half the game into the alliance, forces forum participation for the long con of showing ads there. Multi Dollar Media Empire indeed
---
Can someone explain what pirat is exactly?
---
Yes. Hong Kong is currently protesting to be able to have open elections, something promised to them over 20 years ago that Beijing never allowed.
---
But actively running abyssal sites doesn't violate the code.
---
/r/evejobs
---
You did eve a favor. Thank you! I'm sure many alliances would like to help for the next. Lets put the differences aside and wipe Pirat.
---
try again mate max temps ive seen EVER was 75
---
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAA. WONDERFULL
---
It’s fine to train for Amarr, just build up armor, gunnery, and energy weapon skills, and tryout the T1 attack frigs and cruisers.
---
I have never fit a laser, but apparently they are cap heavy compared to hybrid weapons, so your engineering skills should be trained decently.
---
No, stop being a terrible awful pilot you moron.
---
MALRO industries is dedicated to maximizing player engagement with EVE Online.
---
i know it works for me with proton 3.7 but not higher in steam
---
Wew lad... Nothing like lying to your fleet to get them to undock
---
did they change how crystals work? there for active reps right??
---
Worked on 2 notebooks and 1 desktop pc
---
Yes it would give them an unique useful ability, the problem is that this ability would be broken in so many ways.
---
Sorry l did forget to add in crimea ...
---
Did you quit again, Sylnn? :(
---
Who will I yell at, on PB?
---
got'em
---
The EVE IPH tool can calculate exactly what you'll make with different setups, telling you what ore will make what and in what state (raw, compressed, processed). I heartily recommend checking it out!
---
Poor PIRAT. That must have hurt their effici... oh, wait. No. This barely affects them at all. I've been on the receiving end of them enough times that I've almost gotten kind of fond of them. 
---
Well, until they did some bullshit corp hopping thing to avoid the defenders when they came to finish off my own Fortizar, but even so. I don't really get the level of hate people show for them. They provide a valuable service in Eve. 
---
Someone's gotta clean up highsec and stomp on the bears a bit every once in a while, or they'll get as complacent and whiny as the nullbears when their perfect safeties crack and tumble a bit.
---
Moonmoon is like all of test combined in one person
---
Could be a cache issue if you recently resculpted your character or took a new profile picture for them, perhaps after changing outfit, etc.
---
I had an issue where one of my alts didn't have a profile picture for about 3 months despite multiple cache clears.
---
This sub probably makes more players quit than the game itself.
---
You already have tethering, you can sell ACL access on a corp or even individual pilot level basis.
---
Only difference is the bump mechanic on tethered caps; I don't know if they still plan to change this (they asked for feedback on making tethered ships unbumpable earlier this year but not sure if any action came from it).
---
Goons should ban him from doing Stukas, it does not support their narrative campaign that bombers need nerfing XD
---
&gt; I cant believe Goons even let the guy in....
---
Not sure if serious ....
---
We both know that you can also bridge sup-caps to a cyno.
---
you are welcome
---
How? All it does is make the situation more complicated
---
He's killing fw mission runners.  That's doing god's work.
---
Correct. As long as no functionality is locked behind a paywall you are fine to accept voluntary donations that remove ads or give some cosmetic flair to users.
---
:D
---
aah moving the goal posts
---
How will this create content? On one hand you say it will take &lt;1mik to kill, how is anybody supposed to defend this if not sitting next to it? 
---
This is just garbage ass structure killmail farming. 
---
It reminds me of siphon units and the ess. It was 1 week of fun, then nobody cared anymore.
---
shut up and buy skins
---
Yes, I do both the Guristas and Angel arcs every three months in an Ares. It is a great ship for it.
---
Well, if they'd actually go after their targets in other systems but around Jita and Amarr, I'd agree. Although they appeared to be quite honorable at standing by their word. I really dunno but camping entrances to trade hubs and hoping for the carebear stupid enough to not contract to out of corp chars is kinda lame.
---
"Citadel spam will be kept in check by players."
---
This is actually a pretty light response fleet to feed into. He could have easily gotten his fleet out safely, but chose to feed entirely instead.
---
Fail couple of times and she explodes?
---
They don't hunt wizards so what's even the point?
---
You can't.
---
This is true for a lot of players, doesn't matter which age they are IRL or ingame. If you are lucky, they hang out on comms, but usually you don't find them there either, because they can't find the information how to connect to those.
---
The ones who are actually able to read and process information end up being in CEO, diplo or some other role pretty fast and will also be doomed to write mails, bulletins and other information in discord and forums, knowing most people will not read them.
---
I recommend integrating some sort of "reading" or common sense requirement into your recruitment standards.  My corp always talks to people over comms before sending a corp invite, with which we can usually see how much trouble/effort it takes to get them onto a teamspeak server.
---
Damn...that put's it into perspective lmao thanks for the recap.
---
Not realy a P2W but sometime it can looks like it. 
---
There is an item called PLEX you can buy 500 of them for 20$. sell 500 PLEX for isk (In game currency) to a rich guy and he will turn them into 30 days game time without have to pay with RL money. 
---
after this, you have a ton of isk. with it, you can buy skill injectors to have better skills, a  powerfull shiny ship, or lots of cheap ships to have fun. and you dont have to earn money with Pve if you don't like that. 
---
So, yes, If you burn your credit card, you will have some advantages. 
---
BUT Eve is a realy complex game. the win or lose is not only decided by who have more SP or a better ship. 
---
Who have the best intel? will you surprise your ennemi? Will you keep your mind clear during the fight? did you think about combats drugs? do you have en efficient fitting for what you are doing? resist hole? improvisation? individuals piloting skills? do you have friends? how many? how good are they? etc... 
---
honnestly, I have lots of SP and isk, but I still have no idea how to be good at this game. 
---
 
---
As young player, don't run after money or skill points. just have fun, try lots of things, learn, find friends, learn again and finally buy an Omega subscripton with RL money. soon you will begin to earn isk more easily. now you can buy some skill injectors because you know what you like to do in Eve and how to use your skill points. 
---
Eventualy, one day, you will be realy efficient at printing isk. this day, you can become to think about buying some plex. you are now the rich guy and can have muliple account payed with isk only
---
How do you even defend from npc spawns with just a porp?
---
In my experience, orca would handle it much better
---
A good idea, so it probably won't happen
---
There are people that look for information before asking questions, and there are people that ask before looking. You won’t be able to fix that!
---
Not sure if you said this, but best thing you can do is have one central spot for everything. I mean all of it! Make some kind of document or spreadsheet that has a link or image of where everything is and anytime the question is ask, link it and don’t say anything more.
---
And how many people still sell escalations these days?
---
I was CEO of one of Co2's medium sized corps back in the Impass days. 
---
My wall of text was just a fancy welcome followed by TS - Follow this link ect for all the 3rd party stuff.
---
Invite was only sent when both a recruiter and the recruit were on at the same time. So that the recruiter would be able to spend an hour getting the recruit setup. 
---
Joining a new corp is very daunting, lot of 3rd party systems, lot of moving about, getting doctrines sorted and trying not to look like a fuckup so that you can make some friends. 
---
Make your new people's lives easier by taking them through all the 3rd party services and then verify that their setting won't piss off an alliance FC.
---
Tbh me and some friends stopped playing a few years ago once we got war dec'd more frequently
---
tell that to the other two of his :D
---
being a trillianaire since before plex was worth 1 billion probably has its ups and downs
---
The counter to a moonapoon fleet does indeed seem to be moonapoon.
---
I am torn.
---
On one hand, I have sold multiple escalations as well when I had a character doing super ratting, was a nice way to get some extra 100m ticks at the end of the day.
---
On the other hand, maybe it would be better for the game to get rid of the ability to trade escalation bookmarks alltogether, by making the person who got the escalation the only one who can initially activate the first gate.
---
Personally I had more fun doing escalations with friends than selling them of to a guy who does nothing else.
---
It's a trap!
---
How many people actually get scammed by this?  I have been buying and selling sites for about 2 years and haven't ever ran into an issue. I mean If people are buying contracts out of corps/alliance,  then there shouldn't be much of and issue. What's next, removing contracts completely so Jita scammers cannot prey? People learn quickly, and it's a playstyle for those individuals.
---
Removing yet another playstyle that is going to mess with new player retention within the game.
---
I guess NC. Has theirs now huh?
---
But you killed highsec freighter ganking completely while pretending the change has something to do with people getting stuck in geometry. Wouldn't the removal of more possibilities to mess with people just be consequent given the current direction given to the game by CCP?
---
No. Dont do that. Im not saying it would be a problem. You have the wrong attitude. People should be able to fuck with them not make it safe.
---
While its technically possible it requires you to be online to add people to your ACL. The old system allows you to drop your bookmarks on contracts when you're done ratting and go to bed. So for all intents and purposes it's going away and is being replaced with a different but worse system.
---
Thanks for the replies and the fits, both look good and are a great starting point.  
---
I don't have enough CPU or Powergrid for u/jambeeno fit or enough Powergrid for u/Imaginary_Deparment fit but I guess that comes to skills.  I have most useful things (Magic 14 etc.) to IV but I'm being selective over the Vs I train just due to the time taken.  
---
I might adjust these fits slightly to get them into my skill range or bite the bullet, buy some injectors and get skilled up!  Really useful stuff 😊
---
Real talk has there been any official statement on what they will do with bookmarks at these spots?
---
Thanks
---
That's an interesting alternative. Would you share a fit?
---
And do tell how would my fix make them safe? If you're in system you could still scan them down. It would just make the sale safe.
---
You can't. The same problem exists in workplaces, even when people's livelihoods are at stake. Upon being shown some technical information, arranged with FAQs etc, one kid whined "I shouldnt be Expected to read THAT" and expected me to donate hours to teach him the same stuff. I didnt. So these days my answer is "if you cant be bothered to read the docs, what makes you think I can be arsed to waste hours with you?"
---
So use your magical powers as CEO. Weigh the cost of repeating yourself against these peoples' actual value. Make it a mandatory requirement to read the info, or else kick them. This is, of course after you've self critiqued the writing. 
---
TLDR: If someone is too lazy to search, they're too lazy to read stuff. Consider kicking them.
---
Highsec war dec mechanic abusers who also happen to be one of the few remaining mercenary outfits. They almost exclusively fly blingfit ships and they have mastered risk averse highsec pvp to the same degree that eilite-null pvpers have mastered safe krabbing.
---
The mere mention of them is enough to send many players, highsec and null alike into a frothing seizure.
---
Seems like you are pointing out the only real issue with the new system but to be fair I have rarely seen escalations being on the market for longer than half an hour after being posted in the relevant channel.
---
So what makes you think he used a script? I'm curious.
---
Do you have based observations and log entries like most of the bot hunters have that still get yelled at "reee, show me proof" or is it just hearsay that fits your narrative ?
---
yeah generally just do t2 frigs or even t1 frigs work. I've had issues before in an AF killing a t1 before just because they were better versed in technical mechanics then I was.
---

---
Did Lawton not get banned or otherwise punished for that?  And now you can't do that in the rookie help channel or it's an insta-ban.  Same for ganking in rookie systems.  
---
Do you have any proof from, I don't know, the last year or two?

---
Kendarr was good but wasnt Redline bad? I just remember him sperging out in many of the various Jr FC Discords after things not going his way (Like if someone brought 1 more ship than his fleet, or upshipped to a larger class but with less people).
---
lets wait for trig dread and see how it will adapt in wspace
---
Bringing back passive mining isn't going to do anything for content. You still have to deal with the terrible citadel timers which is the #1 cause of the stagnation around the game right now.
---
It's funny it's an exploit here.  In Elite Dangerous it's actually a mission the system offers you (or rather it used to be) near one of the starter systems.
---
You can't, you just make a link with all the relevant info and link it to them when they ask questions. Try to ignore them for a while then, take a shit, make a sandwich, and odds are you come back to "nm I got it now". Just try not to micromanage them and hand hold them, it will save your sanity.
---
Thanks and Omega
---
Thanks!
---
Wut? Which alliance?
---
It was the HQ for around 7 out of 170 wars they had active. They had put it up so they got a fight and they got a decent one for the armor timer, then predictably got outnumbered for the hull timer.
---
I reckon they see it as a win for them, the salt from this thread and Peri local at the time more than make up the lost ISK
---
There is alot of issues around this buy I think it's a good idea. I also think it should be lowsec only.
---
Honestly, don't know why everyone is gets so mad at them. They are a minor annoyance at best. If you're a vet you probably have an out of corp alt that you can use for hauling and if you're a newbie from a large alliance/coalition you have your options to transport your stuff through your alliance's logistical network.
---
Best way to get rid of them is not to blow up their structures. They're filthy rich and can afford to replace them. Best way is to stop whelping stupid shit to them in Jita (or anywhere else).
---
This can't be real. You want to go to law school to sue someone over Eve? On its face that's absurd. 
---
If serious it would be considerably cheaper to just hire an attorney than become one. Im assuming this is a parody or troll post.

Sure, but part of that is that you have to go "home" to put the bookmarks up, now you could be already selling them the instant you have it, or even earlier (post in a channel as you are heading out to the system, arrange a buyer, and add them to the bookmark the moment you have it.
---
Thank you this is exactly what I was looking for!

Sir were you not informed you also needed a force recon printed with your rorq? The alliance would like to save your 3d printed rorq.

Concur, miss the times we could engage war targets.  Forget the fleet commanders name, but the time we undocked in a blob of caracels and hosed down Pirate's Proteus bling will forever be in my mind...good times.  Miss having Sabre in channel too, always guiding, helping, and putting out the good info stripped of BS.
---
That wasn’t an option listed but thanks for playing
---
One of the reasons that lowsec campus relocated was because we couldn't really undock with being hot dropped by larger pirate corp...I doubt fully that relocating did much to prevent that, but that's what I heard when trying to decide whether or not to come back to game.

Daym, this burn hotter than even PGLs hot wings.

Hope this isn't too stupid of a question, but how can PIRAT afford 19bil a week for wars?

It is great when highsec corps can't even defend a citadel. Back to ganking miners and haulers. Elite PvPers at work here!

The deepsafes have been decreed by ccp as an exploit that works by going beyond the normal system range.  
---
They will care about a person there, maybe not as much as a citadel, but they will care.
---
This is not the first time this has been declared.
---
We need to go deeper.

I’m really surprised by this, we use Orca at our moons in jspace, we’ll have scouts at every hole and keep it aligned.

That's impressive! I once went for a solo roam, didn't find anyone, but found dozens of corpses at the sun, I scooped them all and added to my collection.

Or you’re just using a looting script to accomplish something that a person cannot do on their own. It’s not even hard. Scripts are a ridiculously common form of cheating now, both on PC and console games (Chronus Max, Titan II, Strike Packs, etc). 
---
Like all the other cheaters in modern gaming, you don’t get punished like you should, but of course, you constantly proclaim that you’re an honest player. Go watch a PUBG stream that isn’t Choco or Shroud: it’s all RADAR, rapid fire macros, or anti-recoil scripts. And of course, all of them deny any wrongdoing. And of course, few of them get banned. 
---
RIP you and your cheating.

if you like flying with other people, nothing stops you doing the myriad of other activities in eve that require more pilots than it's possible to multibox.
---
For new corp members, make doing all the things part of a trial week period. They get it all done or they get kicked out. Corp mail and chat are outdated and unpopular. Like u/Shalmon_ points out though, players who put in effort to do things for the group benefit are the ones you want to cultivate anyway. They will become the useful officers.
---
&gt; &gt; It's already dependent on interaction from players. You don't seem to understand this.
---
&gt; Do you mean it must remain that way?
---
I'm saying it's mechanically impossible to change it without fundamentally altering how wormholes work, so... yeah, I guess I'm saying it must remain that way.
---
&gt; The rolling of holes is different from the free intel issue.
---
No, it really isn't.  The main time that "wormhole appears" implies somebody just warped to it is when people are repeatedly rolling their static, generally looking for a target exactly like the bears who are afraid of someone doing that.
---
&gt; Max mass could be dependent on hole level.
---
It already is?  What I was saying is that, unless wormholes no longer collapse due to too many ships going through them, players will always be able to affect (at least in the reducing direction) what wormholes are connected to wherever they are.  In that case you'd be stuck with whatever connections you get on any given day.  You would then also be able to bring an arbitrary number of ships to any given engagement.  The former implication might be interesting.  The latter is something I am thoroughly not a fan of, because it means that wormholes would basically become cyno-jammed nullsec with gates that are randomized daily.
---
Going back to something you said earlier that I admit I glossed over:
---
&gt; The rolling of holes likely needs to be nerfed.
---
I assure you, as nice as rolling high-class holes with capitals currently is, we all know how to roll holes with battleships if we need to.  After all, some holes don't take capitals, and the krabs still roll those.  Do you have something in mind to nerf hole rolling?  I assure you that wormholers are just as good at hating themselves until they win as nullsec logisticians.

---
I did level 3 missions in an assault frigate.  There was only one I couldn't do, as it had both a web tower and a neut tower; could handle any mission with just one of those.

I even did level 4 missions in it, but that wasn't really practical if you are trying to earn ISK.
