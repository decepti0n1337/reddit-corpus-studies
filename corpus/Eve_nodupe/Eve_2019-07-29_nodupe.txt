Do you have a fit for that? I was playing around and got more out of an oversized prop succubus. Not doubting you, I’ve heard it from multiple sources, just want to see where I’m messing up.
---
---
---
Hey, congrats on your Nyx, man.
---
While I see your point, killing afk ratters in null is significantly more worthy in my opinion, since you're not potentially pushing away some players while doing something that is extremely boring. At least those in null have made a conscious decision to engage in the risk by moving more than a couple jumps from the starting system.
---
Yeah and lets delete stealth bombers and blops while we're at it too /s
---
Hi Cyanark,
---

---
EVE is a tough game, but you aren't really at a disadvantage coming in late. There are lots of activities and ships you can do and have lots of fun. 
---
[Exploration](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Exploration) is a good, fun way to make money and kill time. It doesn't require more than a day or two to try, though like anything else in EVE more Skill Points in the relevant skills will make the work easier. I do a lot of exploration myself. 
---
It helps to find a welcoming corp, as others have said here. We like to stay that "the best ship is friendship"!
---
Dreddit welcomes players with 5 million SP or 3 months of Reddit account, which you meet. (Though you aren't super active)
---
We have a mentorship program in Dreddit, and you'd be paired with a veteran who will help you find your niche. That includes ships to fly,  skills to train, ways to make money, and Special Interest Groups to join and befriend. Dreddit members are eligible for free ships, free skillbooks, and have their ships paid for when blown up in a fleet. 
---
Our space is arguably some of the safest in the game. (We are in the bottom right of the map, the several regions around Esoteria) we have fleets every few hours to go kill stuff and teach our members how to fly. We have great money making opportunities too. 
---
We use voice comms for fleets and just chatting. Discord is pretty busy. We have forums, a wiki, etc too. We have in-game and Discord help channels for newbies. I still ask questions in there; there's no judgment. 
---
If that sounds interesting, check out www.DredditIsRecruiting.com for the public HR Discord link. 
---
Say hi once you're on discord! I'm Claytonius3 in game and on there.
---
NO cloak event should be fun
---
Go back to WoW please
---
Ganking is not a problem that needs reduction.
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!

Yeh luckily cargo deposit exists or I would have been stuck waiting out the tether delay.
---
Huh, this is a surprisingly good point.
---
Why does ccp even listen to us?
---
No lile for real
---
I don't care for your beta test game, but good luck with work.
---
EVE has no announced or hinted plans to release a mobile game. Given the depth of gameplay it'd be unfeasible; at most you could get an entirely different, EVE themed game.

Eve is for masochists and people chasing the PVP shakes

I’m moonhexx and I approve this message
---
Makes you think.
---
What you see there is the most basic use for the table. It's comparing the price of ore on a specific market. To its refined sell value.  I use it to get a feel for relative prices before planning industry builds. I found IPH which works amazingly for actually planning the industry.  My guess is other people have found they needed something Excel or gsheets readily accepted. So I shared.
---
Don’t give them any ideas, they just finally realized EVE was struggling and making frequent updates is a good idea.
---
I'm going to assume you mean the smartbombing. You can use eve-gatecheck.space to see recent bomb camped gates on your route, and if you suspect there might be bombers you can also warp to nearby celestials to come in at a different angle. It's also highly advisable to fit a decent buffer tank on things like travel inties--I've been smartbombed a few times where an MSE makes the difference.
---
If you mean gate stealth bombing, there are very few things that a single bomb will kill. As long as again, you have a half-assed tank, and dont MWD into the bomb, you should be okay. That's so infrequent I wouldnt even worry about it.
---
Fun is not as treated as big of a victory condition as it should be.
---
no, i'm telling you to just not read them
---
the action is yours to take, not mine
---
If you do start and want to pvp. Skill Amarr or Caldari.
---
People say fly what you want but reality is these two races ships are the meta.
---
https://eve-search.com/thread/881275/page/1
---
Those points are pretty relevant.
---
Kick SNOOO.
---
I stick to PvE myself. I’ve done the PvP thing, was never really any good at it. Just not my thing. I play EVE to relax and let a month of trucking roll off my back (I do enough IRL danger with some places I have to go to, I even pack a pistol and sawed-off in the truck lol). 
---
I’ll agree with the opinion that high sec PvE and Null Krabs are often insulted and belittled for nothing more than doing what the fuck they wanna do, which a solid 60% of “elite PvP gods” believe is somehow their business. In all honesty, most of them act like insecure ego-centric chimpanzees flinging shit everywhere. 
---
CCP will do what they do for their bottom line. The entirety of EVE will adapt or unsub as they see fit. 
---
Shout out to all the peeps who play the game THEIR way and don’t let anyone tell them to line up like sheep to be killed for someone’s zKillboard ego trip. 
---
And for the 40% of you elite players who are just downright cool motherhumpers, this beer is for you. 
---
*pssht*
---
Wow it's so simple. I'm sure CCP never discussed that ever and rejected it for being insanely complicated and work intensive to produce basically the same product they already have
---
Although, it you are on a station, not a citadel, and someone kills your cyno, you will get podded.
---
I was talking about stealth bombing. And I got killed because I was in a pod. I just saw an uncloaked bomber some distance away from the gate, my pods speed dropped to 0 and then I saw my corpse floating. It was the only time I've seen someone doing that. Asked some corpmates about it and they told me he was waiting for shiny pod kills that way. That was a long time ago. But now I'm wondering, shouldn't the bomber not be allowed to release the bomb next to a gate?
---
Everyone likes to do what they like to do. Unfortunately, certain people are very *vocal* that anyone that doesn't like to do things the way THEY like to do them must be WRONG.
---
I mean, I get it. Some people have fun beating up rocks all day. Other people think screwing with the market in a station is the bees knees. Others want nothing more than to blow you, me, and everyone else up. I get paid to move all of these peoples stuff. That's *my* fun.
---
My fun isn't wrong any more than theirs is, but don't worry, I'm told by everyone all the time how wrong I am.
---
Don't listen to them, and keep having fun.
---
Does this also work for caps in siege? Because if so it seems like a great "feature".
---
Oh I created the fitting
---
It should be public now
---
Just not really interested in being forced to train into other weapons systems and races. Minmatar and projectiles is where my loyalty stands.
---
Theta would love it
---
Oh I didnt know that. Good thing I guess.
---
Nah mate it's like like 1400 meters long.
---
Honestly, I haven't even thought about calling that out.  But... they aren't interested in effort, they just want their ego boost for the day, and they want it freely handed to them
---
Right back at you
---
Amazing anyone gives you guys access to anything anymore, probably the best documented back-stabbers in the game
---
In no sandbox game, ever, does a group of "level 1s" raid a top tier enemy headquarters and expect to live.  Especially when outnumbered 1000 to 1.  
---
Forget WoW.... let's talk sandboxes. Rust, Ark, Eve.  In rust, you cannot carry no armor and no explosives and raid a base with 50 active people online using only a few people.
---
In ark, you cannot raid a tek tier base or farming outpost loaded with turrets with naked beach bobs and expect to win. 
---
In eve, you should not expect to take a few frigates and engage the most heavily occupied spaces and expect to "get a few kills before being bosoned".  Thats ignorance, arrogance... honestly it just isnt logical.
---
its there
---
that's about all that can be said for it honestly
---
IF you can't do the career agent missions on your own, you may not make it to the point where you are playing with a goal in mind.
---
C3s have a few RR ships but not many
---
It works on any ship, even in siege if you are in the middle of a cycle on a friendly sit/station in docking range it will auto dock one siege cycle ends
---
Every punisher in a novice is hull brick tanked bait fit.

---
Join Karmafleet of Goonswarm and learn how to live and prosper in null.
---
Yeah. they're buffing it tomorrow.
---
If we moved at a group, like a deployment, it would actually be pretty amusing.  
---
A lot would depend on whatever mechanic CCP would set up.  How fast the decay, how fast the recovery, is mining and ratting tied to ADM anymore.  
---
The idea of moving the entire Imperium into a region and depleting their resources for months at a time would be very entertaining.
---
You should see his other works. My favorites are his paintings of the Oracle and the Stratios.
---
Exactly.

Those choose starting skills and characteristics

if he's not interested in the product, he can quietly leave like everyone else who's not a piece of shit did over the course of the last decade or so since eve's been online  
---
  
---
**anyone** whether it be pve or some pvp mong that announces "THIS IS THE CHANGE DUDE I'LL SHOW YOU CCP I'M UNSUBBING ALL MY ACCOUNTS" is just legitimately dumb af - obviously the only reason they're changing things to begin with is the game's stagnation and dwindling player count
---
I added you! :)
---
as long as he's nice to the newbros... he's got a lot of responsibility on his hands for seal clubbing like this in the year of mittani 2019
---
Step one: join standing fleet
---
Step two: find ratting super
---
Step three: sit cloaked on grid with him while he rats
---
Step four: collect half his tics.

It’s the blue donut. Just missing some reeeeeee sprinkles.
---
GooD Luck Bro \~ xD
---
Well it's just not true is it? I'm not bullying anyone.
---
Definitely not me, just because im comfortable doesnt mean I am not frugal.
---
Yeah I am bitching that CCP decided to just up and completely change most of Eves playstyle and while we are adapting, I did not sigh up to play without local, thats what wormholes are for.
---
&gt;02:25 - **Hilmar**: "We're actually experiencing right now in the month of July, MAU and DAU the highest it's ever been in the last five years" - (DAU/MAU = Daily/Monthly active users).
---
That's the CEO of ccp. It's a fact, boiiiii! :P
---
Thing is, damage is already done. Now we have enough rorq pilots that if they were all mining at least 3 hours a week, supply of minerals would at least double.
---
Excellent tutorials!  Highly recommended.
---
Been playing eve for 2 years now. Still have not engaged in any pvp.... Life's simple
---
EVE 2020 is what someone fingering a hole? Ok.
---
That’s the flip side of the coin. Yes it does make null harder, does it stop botting? Not really sure about that yet until I see some data. Does it slow down mining and printing isk from ratting? Only really on the small alliances. Outside of swapping to T2 mining drones it hasn’t effected big alliances like everyone thought it would. All I’ve seen is the little guys and casual players being hurt by it. Sure some good fights have come out of it that wouldn’t have been possible with local but most of what I’ve seen myself is killboard padding and ‘Elite’ pvp against pve ships. The balance is tipped too far in one direction again and I’m completely for the blackout. There just needs to be a counter play besides joining a big block or having to multi box accounts to sit on gates as well as check sigs. I just want to see something that can help the little guys succeed because everyone loves an underdog story
---
Yeah, this dude and CCP would never lie to you. Ever. Lol
---
You don't have to be so cruel, someone has to clean that mess.
---
Careful now, that doesn't fit the current narrative.
---
I am a returning Eve player. More or less inactive for 18 months, largely because my old corp slowly fell apart as old time players (ironically) went inactive
---
I am interested in WH ops or maybe low sec, something with a mix of regular PvE and PVP. There are a ton of posts saying “there are lots of these corps out there like this, only here is the question - any tips / tricks for actually finding a good one? Do legitimate corps actually advertise in the recruiting section for example?
---
Am I the only one who got turned on by that?
---
Don’t repair. Come join us in lowsec.
---
Cloacking should have a limited time at least. The other day we were intensely camping our system all day, nothing entered, no WH, nothing. 5 cloacky t3c jumped on a dominix and killed it before anyone could arrive. pvpers constatly bash ratters because the're doing it safely meanwhile those same people make things extremely safe for them. I don't even know why people get cloacked so much time in a system just to hunt ratters.
---
Adapt and survive..make it hard to safely rat...we fit ships to evade. My.most recent fit actually waits for u to land tackle before i get away. Its great.
---
Buy Clone Soldier tags to repair it, or kill NPCs in lowsec.
---
Or get a hauler alt and come join the piratey fun!
---
can it though?
---
False. You can sit cloaked off a nyx with a dictor nearby and bubble them when they warp to the next site. King me.
---
&gt; Eve is primarily pvp, but often get a lot of criticism for staying in highsec. People don’t understand why I dislike pvp. Is the pvp vs pve grouping really as big as is portrayed on reddit/fb/forums?
---
My own credit card?
---
Kinda?  I wanted to post something in the same vein as this but couldn't find a not cunty way to do it.... Props to you for making it look easy.
---
maybe you aren't ready for the rattlesnake.
---
look at drone variations and read.
---
damn im half chubbed watching this dude finger a donut

Sort dragon has entered the chat.

Then go to r/eve click the three dots in the upper right and then user flair
---
Because if you couldn't make a contract to yourself, you'd never see that stupid pop-up that some programmer spent 2 minutes on years ago. You gotta see it man, it's like a rite of passage almost
---
Absolutely nothing!
---
I'm sorry, I had to.
---
Regardless on how you got the kills, congratulations. On a side note, that is one ugly ship. Reminds me of the crazy ships from Firefly.
---
Google it there is a lot of lore , but really does not affect you unless you do faction warfare
---
https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/sectags/ will tell you the tags you need to fix your sec status.
---
Good luck, and welcome back!
---
This is copypasta, isn't it? There are no goons that are really this dumb, right?
---
You should be more grateful to the alliance letting you live in their space.
---
oof someones real dumb ;s
---
Go fuck yourself
---
Easy to make Western dinosaur angry lol are you scared of us?
---
shhhhh let people enjoy things....
---
The problem with this is that people who make these suggestiins believe that "need amd greed" motivate gamers to fight.
---
It doesn't. What would happen in null is the same thing that happens in faction warfare. People would make alt groups to farm whatever side has the resources that week/month whatever.
---
 There are folks right now with alts in multiple militias just for the reason.
---
Its like how ccp shook up moon minerals and instead of fighting it encouraged the creation of OTEC.
---
You can't encourage conflict through game development. People in games fight because the fighting is fun, not because of financial rewards.  The fighting in null just isnt fun enough for conflict, fix that and maybe more figgting happens.
---
Suck it
---
My goal is to someday figure out how to stay plex positive. Pretty sure the odds are not in my favor.
---
Dramiel is probably the best t1 roaming frigate in the game.
---
Anyone who thinks keepstars are impenetrable in the face of enemy supercap superiority hasn't being paying attention to EvE.
---
Would be nice but as soon as Titans are dropped (excluding mass 100+ drops) everyone nearby gets a hard on and tackles them like this while they bring in massive fleets the form simply for the kms, not the strategic objective.
---
"People would fight hard to defend their stuff"
---
Nope. They'd keep the minimum in conquerable space, and the rest at a handy midpoint in NPC-controlled space.
---
I like this, will load it up on a spare monitor until I most likely memorize rock composition lol.
---
+1 homie

Lol wut
---
Manticore frigate from Battlestar Deadlock looks this!

Because you can still accept it on behalf of your corporation.
---
Gallente shield fits make me cry ;_;
---
Stares at the mountain of sheets I already have
---
It should. Asset safety was a mistake but CCP wore pink fluffy gloves when transitioning from POS to citadels because they wanted high uptake.
---
Copy and integrate at your leisure m8. That's what it's designed for
---
Teach him, you asshole. Completely non-constructive comment.
---
I think Brick killed a guy!

You could do that before (and was a common tactic).
---
C3 rsnake is cheap af if you passive tank
---
I see this shit and I think it's the guy from South Park who just sat at his PC without moving a muscle just clicking away...
---
128 billion ISK killed by 123 people?  I thought you said you were good?
---
Oof, sorry you lost your Nullspace Horde bro, I know the feel.
---
Another good use similar to this is to turn on autopilot once you enter warp to your Jita / wherever instadocks (assuming you have the correct station set as your desto).
---
You dock as soon as you land.
---
don't be one of those morons that assumes something about a person by their use of words
---
No valid argument?  How so?  I think it is insane to WASTE development time on your shitty plan when EVERYONE ELSE can get the information just fine.  You are a lazy bum.  Face it.
---
As far as reading your conversation with Falcon, I can barely understand the English you are using now, I'm not about to see you fuck it up some more.  I'm fairly certain you are misunderstanding both myself and Falcon, because you are making zero sense.
---
yeah my luck with af's not so hot
---

---
Then you have no issues with losing cloak then.  Good to have your support.
---
It makes sense if you're gonna sit under rorqual reps - unfortunately, getting torps and paints can punch through even those, as it turns out.
---
Was a short quick fleet. Surprised to find content so soon into the fleet versus having to roam Catch or something.
---
Only thing I'd like to make a point of is to use a broadcast key. As I have "Aftermarket" key layout (high slot = Q through I, mid slots A through K, lows Z through &lt;, etc) I have F1 for broadcast target. Easy to do: Hold F1, click target on overview.
---
And do FW on a dedicated separate character unless wanting to be banned from half of High-Sec.
---
But the blackout is such a massive success!! Loads of pvp players are resubbing and there are loads of fights going on! 
---
Way to spin it CCP
---
You literally clubbed baby seals. Nice risk aversion there
---
This happened to me about a year ago - reported the bug then and contacted support. Luckily a friend brought a cap or something over and I was able to transfer the cargo to his fleet hangar and dock.
---
&gt;Get in a Corp as soon as possible, since there is the blackout i would actually suggest some highsec corp with at least occasional pvp in the beginning. 
---
You mean like E-Uni, which has long been the best newbro corp in the game? Lots of high-sec stuff, at least a couple of PVP fleets per week, a decent amount of roaming around Placid and Black Rise with and without fleets (often ending in "FC gets bored and takes the fleet to Tama" situations), also operations in Syndicate and J-space.
---
FC how do I fit lasers on my Phoenix
---
LMFAO! I haven't laughed this hard in a long time
---
nerf supercap power projection's ability to snuff out any dispute in umbrella space.
---
No one said black out was to make nullbears go to war with each other. So why do you think it was added for that reason?
---
Because everything revolves around nullbears, clearly.
---
Join E-Uni. We're the best newbro corp in the game. We can introduce you to basically every aspect of the game (though we don't have sov, so the big crazy stuff that the game is famous for isn't something that we really do). Check out the various things that the Uni has to offer, figure out what you like doing, join a corp which focuses on that when you're ready to move on. Or stay with the Uni forever like a few people (generally more PVE-oriented) have decided to do.
---
Even if you don't join us, join another good corp. That's the most important thing to do starting out. It's not a game which can be easily enjoyed alone.
---
Here's our wiki. Even the people who think you should join a different corp will recommend it. Some of the fits are obsolete (in fact, ship fits are the only gameplay thing which you should NOT trust the wiki for, considering how old a few of them are), but it provides solid tips for how to get started.  [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main\_Page](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main_Page)
---
I had a similar thing happen with a bomb launcher where i could strip the module and refit it but everytime I undocked it was offline. Eventually after stripping, repackaging and refitting the module a few times it finally would stay online.
---
You have me there good sir/ma’am
---
Theres a warning you have to click away before jumping into low sec. If theyre the type of player to click ok and still get upset enough to quit when they lose their ship they wouldn't last long anyway.
---
Never had to do dock/undock thing, all you needed is a session change and changing fleet position was enough for that.
---
Nothing of value was lost.
---
i'm not sure who you're talking about
---
I just started playing again. I’ve had the game since 2007. We could make a corporation together if you want.
---
I only tries to autopilot dock every 10 seconds (as I recall), so just time activating autopilot appropriately
---
fuck yeah
---
Hi Plebius, given that this CCP's first ever major change to the game I believe their idea is to market this as heavily as possible. Hence, they give as many incentives as they can to capitalize on their first major change. 
---
The decision to use these incentives does not imply that the blackout change is not successful.
---
It’s more about not having your cyno ship or pod drifting off tether, the 10 seconds isnst much of a problem if you forget about your alt.
---
How come zkillboard awards \`1\` point per titan, for a total of \`4\`. However dreads are worth \`9.85\` points each when losing 27. And \`6.66\` when losing \`15\`?
---
Is it related to the other kills for that side, and the total number of that ship class lost?
---
Right, you have more credibility, random nullbear. /S
---
This I see no problem with, you’re in null and literally let people know you were going to be mass hauling out of the system. You’re also not new so you should know better. What did you expect?
---
I disabled the wheel menu without ever seeing this video because every time I wanted to change what angle I was viewing the environment from, if I got too close to an object or my ship or what have you it would activate. Now I need to find a way to disable the double-click function on like everything because my LMB is shitting the bed and I'd rather not open an info panel or fly straight at a bad guy in combat when I don't intend to.
---
This. It's not an instant-dock. Autopilot always only ticks every \~10 seconds, no matter what it's trying to do. It works great for warp-and-dock because as long as you hit the dock button while in warp it'll immediately try to dock on the tick after exiting, but for cyno/siege/etc... it'll just try to dock whenever it ticks.
---
PI, build stuff, sell stuff, explore/take stuff from explorers, huff gas, kill sleepers, you can do it.
---
This is not the time, Wicker.
---
Exactly, just need more info from him. Like his Rattlesnake location.
---
Bloc wars are happening naturally. The war in the south/east is just getting slowed to a really slow rate due to mechanics like cyno jammers and the timezone tank mechanics in the game.
---
On the other side of eve a war was happening but goons just kinda roflstomped the enemy and goons retreated early due to a premature reaction to a ccp surprise mechanic (at least I think this is what happened).
---
Wars are happening even if they wouldn't need to resource wise because wars are fun. There just haven't been super cap battles because of mechanics.
---
I gotta say, even my npc corp has more people talking and doing stuff lately, i know jack about statistics except 62.4% are made up.
---
Ree.
---
When its dead, can i eat it?
---
Cents are worth more.

[I agree.](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/antagonists/images/f/f2/D9249a0ca874c3c3b6641814d40fe87764568388_hq.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20181109210945)
---
There's a bloc war going on right now.  They just don't look like the bloc wars you remember from the old days because of three mechanics: Jump Fatigue, sov ADMs, and Rorqual mining.  There's nothing inherently wrong with that, but the days of entire coalitions deploying across the map to fight each other are for the most part gone, except for rare exceptions like last summer (and even then really on PL deployed any real distance, everyone else stuck pretty close to their friendly retreat routes).
---
uncalled for
---
Kelon Darklight, the single best solo PVPer in the game, is currently in Tuskers. He's killed me a few times, I've killed him via blob (and only blob).
---
Balance caps first.
---
Delete this
---
He was just informing you. Session change will cause your pods death.
---
PVP makes more PVP content than if you do PVE :)
---
Even though your character is of a certain race, pod pilots (like you) actually stand apart from them a bit and can pursue whatever they want. They can also fly whatever they want as well.
---
As for the politics of the empires, Caldari and Gallente dont like each other cause they fought a war which Caldari lost and got kicked out of their home system (both races come from the same star system but from different planets), while the Amarr had previously enslaved the Minmatar.
---
Gallente get along with Minmatar cause they're all freedom lovers while Caldari and Amarr get along because basically it helps to have allies to trade with. All of the empires work together in ways such as CONCORD and hating Sansha's Nation.
---
But individuals can honestly work any where, it's just that unless you're a fancy pod pilot you rarely ever get the chance.
---
Very Nice OP.
---
What is incorrect? Might have been bit hyperbole but my point was that PVP players create more content into the game than purely PVE players.
---
Hi, fellow RS enthusiast.
---
I also love the ship. Tho I think you might want to reconsider using it in WH solo. I take it since you still asking and need more info about drone, you still newbie like me.
---
To operate RS in WH, you need to close the WH by roll it. Its the minimum requirement to use RS safely. To rolling a system, you gonna need resources and teamwork that usually found in a corp. So, you better join a corp.
---
RS, not just beautiful ship, she is a mighty beast. People use it in LV4 mission HS, Nullratting, or one man fleet with three maxed RS pilots that can solo run even C5.  
---
I suggest you to use RS in LV4 mission first. Go to Apanake, do their lv4 SOE mission. That agent wont give you Gurista enemy often. Which means, T1 Sentry in an RS gonna stomping everything. Since the role bonus are like lv5 Dominix battleship skill.
---
So here how I did to put it simple. Put MJD (micro jump drive), so you can jump 100 km away, pull out your sentries, and shoot anything that slowly come at you from afar.
---
Just need to tweak on sensor booster and drone link modules depend on your pilot skill. Change your sentries based on how close they are. Warden when in 90km, Garde after they in 50 km. At 30 KM, change your sentry to medium/small drone because only cruisers can reach you this far. Your cruise missile are used for the battleship since from the start, or you can fit light missile or heavy missile, since they still get the ship bonus too.
---
Next year, after you get more familiar with the game, you can start to search RR Rattlesnake, or spider tanking Rattlesnake. Then you can start play with the big bois.
---
You get more yes, but the sig bloom counters the advantage that gives.

Except for the fact that I live in NPC null and not Sov null so my crabbing is generally about improving my stuff and saving for an upgrade over what I am using to make sure I live longer. Again I have no issues with the blackout except for the dscan immune crap that wont take a possibl;e even fight and waits until I down ship to something that's an easy kill. That is my only problem. I the "leet" pvp players weren't so worried about the potential loss of isk or kill boards they'd take fights that were at least in the realm of possibly losing. As it stands now my losses consist of total PVE haulers and a cruiser that was ratting in belts no less. All to dscan immune or cloaky Loki's.
---
Wow is a different game
---
Look at youtube tutorials, do the career agent missions and try things out slowly.
---
Get your feet wet and try to learn a few things on your own before you join a corp. Ask questions in the help chat channels and even in your starting corp channel. A lot experienced players keep alts (secondary characters on the same or a different account) in the starting corp, in order to have a character that can mask their true affiliation with a certain group. So, there's bound to be someone in there who knows quite a bit more about the game.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Joining newbro friendly corps is all the rage lately and they do a good job of integrating players in the game, but i wouldn't immediately join Karmafleet (Goonswarm), Pandemic Horde or anything similar. They will definitely teach you the basics of the game and the nullsec lifestyle, but there's  a small problem. If you immediately go to nullsec, you will not know if there was something else you might have liked doing better. Plus, you join groups that are already very big and it might become a bit faceless and impersonal, so then you usually have to join subgroups within that group based on what activities they like doing. I think starting out small and then growing into bigger things is a better experience overall and gives you time to digest the game properly.
---
So, try out different activities and see what you like first, then join a group based on that. You might enjoy being a pirate or faction warfare pilot in lowsec, why waste time moving to null? Or you might actually like it in null, why join a lowsec group? Or you might prefer wormholes and say "stuff it" to both low and null. The list goes on and on and the amount of "professions" and possibilities available in this game are staggering. Take a look: [https://eve-guides.fr/images/wtd.jpg](https://eve-guides.fr/images/wtd.jpg)
---
All i'm saying is, sample the free buffet before deciding what's your favorite restaurant to keep eating at every single day.
---
Apart from that, the game has no endgame of its own. It's a sandbox, so you have to set your own goals to keep yourself motivated. Especially with the currently inflated economy, doing simple things like "making money" or "getting a bigger ship" is dead simple once you get a bit of knowledge (just takes some time) and will get you bored. For example, i returned to the game after 12 years and rolled a new character. I had a few hundred million isk on my two old characters. I played less 10 months across the span of 2 years on all my characters, with just a single month of omega thrown in there. I'm now sitting on 17 billion liquid isk, with a lot more stuff in assets. And i'm just a solo guy who plays casually on and off (due to real life time constraints), without a corp to help me.
---
So don't get too hung up on amassing wealth, just focus on learning first. To enjoy the game in the long run, what matters most is finding a good group to roll with and doing things that make for memorable stories.
---
Have fun.
---
P.S. Check this beginners guide too, there's even a section on the basics of wormholes for some quick (but sometimes risky) cash grabs to kickstart you career: [https://www.thealphasguide.com/](https://www.thealphasguide.com/)
---
Yup, very right. See, spaceships work a bit like personal cars, and the fact that one flies a cap-guzzling Amarrian-made ride has nothing to do with the fact one despises the Amarr Imperial government and their ham-handed ways. It’s a practical thing.
---
The place where you were born and the ship you fly does not determine your political faction. Only you do.
---
(PS. I can see how having a personal armed spaceship would have been akin to owning your own tank, and how parking your Uralvagonzavod-made T-90 at Fort Knox would have been... impractical. But that was back in the XXIth century.)
---
So as the other guy said you probably have a decent way to go before you actually use a rattle if you ask “like what” to using faction drones.
---
However, everyone has to learn somehow.
---
There are three types of faction drones, ‘regular’ faction, augmented, and integrated. You’ll want ‘regular’ faction, and these will have the same name except a prefix of the race. So wasps (caldari Heavy drones) are caldari navy wasps, ogres (gallente) will be federation navy, praetors (amarr) imperial navy praetors, and berserkers (minmatar) republic fleet berserkers. 
---
They’re more expensive, but deal more damage, have more health, and if you’re using a rattle you should use faction drones.
---
u/quill18 is a good man, I can't wait to collect his frozen corpse
---
I agree about the buffing of mining ships. I even like the idea of the decloak pulse. I will say I'd rather have a real "delayed" local like maybe 1-2 minutes that gives time for hunters to find what they need and gives some of us who will gladly fight a chance to get in a proper fighting ship. I'm currently down PI haulers and a ratting cruiser in belt ratting no less and its all to cloaky campers or dscan immune ships who only jump on the easy kills not the ones that might be a fight that could go either way.
---
That's my point and I actually live in NPC null not Sov null so I don't have an umbrella nor am I making billions of isk in a Rorq or Super. Mining tends to be Orca for boosts because its affordable to lose and procs and hulks depending on if its Ice or Moon mining. Ratting consists of cruisers and BS for me.
---
If you want your hand held there are plenty of shitty MMOs out there that babysit you from start to finish never letting you experience anything more harrowing than a repair bill for your equipment.
---
Kinda made my day.
---
Oshhh thanks :)
---
The wheel is way better if it's not on left mouse button.
---
To add on this:
---
In theory,  *You COULD* solo C4s in a rattlesnake.   The problem is as you listed and also how long it takes to clear the site compared to just running two rattlesnakes.   It's not really efficient to run them alone.   
---
There's also the fact taking 10-15 minutes to do one site can also increase chances of somone finding you.
---
The answer is duct tape. Lots of duct tape
---
Ive honestly never thought to try this, what happens?
---

Invtypes.
---
Things with blueprint in the name, which are published and have a marketgroupid
---
Sure they are except for the fact for some ships to fit them would be so gimped you might as well be flying a roll of toilet paper. without cloaks and dscan immunity there would be less ganks for the "leet" pvp players though. You know Loki's and other cruisers.
---
Over 10 years.  I've been playing Eve since Feb 2009.  Over 10 frickin' years!
---
I never thought of contracting my ship away to get a noobship (handy when you want a cyno ship).  I'm such a moron.
---
Thanks +1
---
The problem there is you make it even harder to get new groups into null
---
How about a floating Nyx
---
You *can* do it without a mouse but it takes longer. First you have to hit alt + left and right arrows a few times (this actually cycles through targets, no idea why you have to do it), then use alt + up and down to cycle through items in the overview window. Then all you have to do is press D to warp and jump.
---
In late 2018 soem of the leadership had left or were tired of the alliance I guess up in Deklein. Their leadership was in anarchy for a bit if I remember and they decided to leave Deklein and tried making a new home in etherium reach during the silent war that went on over there. After they got kicked out during the campaign I believe they decided to just go their seperate ways. Sorry I don't have an accurate description.
---
:smugdog:
---
Def worth it!
---
Please feel free to hit me up in you face questions on the Gallente/Caldari WZ
---
as opposed to now?
---
That's almost as bad as Google-ing 'Google'.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEwW6D0sht0
---
Ill assume you are also in support of removing dscan immunity from combat recons? Because off grid, its essentially the same as a cloak. 
---
Lets do one better. Lets remove cloaks and then give everyone a big neon sign that says "I'm hunting you" that can be seen system wide?
---
Shit wait thats what local chat used to be. Woops.
---
You need to just live in lowsec.  Make friends with a JF pilot and the rest is groovy
---
Yup. WH space solo is totally doable. I lived in a c5 with me and a few alts for nearly a year: just gotta know what you’re getting into.
---
Assuming you plan on living out of a hole with a structure...
---
Ships: scanner obviously, some pvp ship(s), rolling ships, and a DST if you can to get stuff in and out of the hole relatively safely.  
---
Tools: you’ll want some sort of mapper tool. Tripwire and pathfinder are two off the top of my head
---
Which militia did you fight for?
---
I read the entire thread. And i gained one deep insight.
---
The OP is an asshat.
---
I think my corp mate has a JF pilot honestly. Ill probably start up a new toon and throw it in a rifter/wolf and go have some fun in FW. I like KSpace to much, and PI is ezpz isk-erinos.
---
No, I saw it but "sounds like", isn't a fact.
---
Honestly, they should just change the mining boosts (only) to system-wide again, though keep them active. Can't tether, but same one minute cooldown on the suspect timer thing. Remove the excavators through a generous buyback program. That would slowly eliminate the number of rorquals through attrition, because you know SOMEBODY is gonna get bumped off tether range and killed now and then. Plus it would eliminate the number of roquals on grid. It would be emergent gameplay again, though it still wouldn't solve the bot problem.
---
Hell my goal in eve was honestly looking to live a nomadic life in eve with pvp, living from npc nullsec or low sec but I've had a problem with finding a place or people that do it and when I do find a place I think I'll enjoy it there. But when I do live that type of life style I get bored within a few days or for some reason I just stop logging. I don't know why.
---
It says something along the lines of, he can't help you find yourself, you'd need a psychologist for that.
---
then they will always have out sentries/drones of some type where anyone who warps on grid from a fleet of rorqs gets instablaped.
---
You missed out the most important political element of it all.
---
One big major reason  for the passiveness is that No.1 and No.2 are closely aligned for the first time in a very long time, the new "Strategic meta" is we have no.2 whose aspiration is to blue up just play long.
---
They aren't making the play to be the top dawg which used to be the case historically. So, basically we have a subservient passive no.2 whi has changed the meta in many ways i.e. make it passive, as you sum up no.1 and 2, they form up about 75% of null.
---
ur mom, lmao
---
 Cognitive bias and anecdotal evidence versus them actually taking all the data points in. Yeah I'm sure you have it all figured out from some sampling on reddit...
---
Test is number 2 because they are goon pets. If they weren’t, then goons would do to Esoteria what they just finished doing to Tribute. 
---
The only way Test can turn on goons and survive is by blue’ing Panfam and WinterCo, and that’s not going to happen any time soon. 
---
It’s not really anyone’s fault, I can’t blame Vily for not wanting to destroy everything he has built just because people are complaining about nullsec getting stale, and Panfam mostly shot test because they wanted to make content short term. And of course Mittens is playing the long game, and has been for a while, so if the only way to ensure goon supremacy is to ally with test instead of shooting them, that’s what he’s going to do. Sooner or later things will change, and the house of cards will fall, we’ve had bigger blue donuts before and none of them lasted
---
Source? What data was faked?
---
Yep, I prefer to have it mapped to middle mouse with no delay, but you can also set it to an arbitrary key in Shortcuts -&gt; General -&gt; Radial Menu. Also in that panel is [Broadcast Radial Menu](https://i.imgur.com/64GC1sP.gifv), which is quite handy.
---
No.
---
Not according to the people with those actual numbers...
---
MAU and DAU is not how many are logged in at once.
---
Why would they lie about it instead of just telling the truth or not bringing it up? This conspiracy in this thread that all the numbers are fake is insane.
---
Idk man I am with you. Why does everyone in this thread think they know all the exact data and that CCP is lying? I don't even get the point of that.
---
First ever major change? What the hell are you smoking dude.
---
Rolling out a major change, and then immediately bombarding us with SP events and other login incentives, means any metric they get can not be attributed to the change alone.
---
It may very well be that the blackout had a positive effect on numbers. But now we will never know. The numbers are highly questionable at best, and any claim that the blackout had a positive effect can now be legitimately cast in doubt.
---
If you keep having issues, contract the ship to me and I will see if I can fix it
---
Then don’t get scrammed
---
Resource depletion would make groups like Goons leave huge space empty waiting to get taken. 
---
As long as the depletion would go down to a level enough to sustain a couple hundreds people, not thousands, it would be a good way to at least have the big blocks move once every few months.
---
Wolf is much better than a jaguar for solo. Jaguar is good for getting heavy tackle in a frigate. But it doesn’t have the fitting space to be fast, tanky, and have decent dps, and compromising any of those really hurts. Wolf can have good tank, good speed, and good dps. If will never outrun or outtank a speed brick jaguar, but for a all around ship it performs much better
---
I'd like it. Probably harder to implement than it seems though.  
---
I do keep the ships of sentimental value though, get them delivered to Jita and keep any related killmails in a notepad. 
---
Got to roleplay yourself I guess, like this one time I bought a few Thrashers in hisec, the guy selling them messaged me thanking for my order, said he's manufacturing them, so I ordered 50 more :3
---
Hmm, that's fair enough. I admit I don't read the eve-o forums so that probably accounts for it.
---
Aww, &lt;3 KOS, I used to go to their space for good fights often. https://zkillboard.com/related/30002932/201610010500/
---
It helps with blending.
---
Easy to make retards on reddit think you're in x alliance by using a flair eyy lmao
---
Yet some players are more useful for the game than others. You want more of those useful players in game because they create content for others and keep the game running.
---
Read a different fucking book you cretin holy shit
---
That's assuming the rorquals can lock them in less than 10 minutes
---
Space aids is basically gone, we hale fatigue-less player build jump gates, and the maximum red timer for cap jumps is 30 minutes. With a JF or rorq though you can jump like every 5 minutes all day long.
---
It's a trap
---
I upvote this thread and your comment.
---
Not literally Ian
---
That wouldn't do shit because there are lots of extremely empty null regions that the blocs can just shift guys over to.
---
Suppose Delve Depletes, well [Querious is right next door](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Querious/F2OY-X#npc24) and extremely devoid of activity. So Goon just have a move op and shift a part of the Umbrella over to Querious and let Delve resources regenerate. The generous upwell timers means you aren't going to be able to kill any of the structures left in Delve.
---
When Querious depletes, you shift over to [Period Basis](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Period_Basis/TN25-J#npc24) to let Querious recover. Once Period Basis is depleted you go back to Delve, etc.
---
This is not the only case. You have other similar systems in [Deklein](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Deklein#npc24), [Fade](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Fade#npc24), and [Pure Blind](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Pure_Blind#npc24).
---
You know who is fucked? Providence, because they only have that one region that's going to get depleted and have no alt space to live in while Provi regenerates.
---
Seems like progress, so if I jump a carrier solo will I get a little timer telling me I cant play the game for an amount of time where all I had to do was wait for my cap to recharge and then jump?
---
Read. Another. Book.
---
I already have my own giant versions but thanks ;) :P
---
The crippling levels of Fatigue have indeed gone away. It remains only in a small amount, and few give a shit about it anymore. 
---
That said, there's now an even more low-effort method of instantly teleporting across the cluster; player built stargates don't give Fatigue.
---
What we need is a fifth house
---
for nerds online who like to grouse.
---
They always are one step ahead 
---
and always claim that "Eve is dead."
---
They don't play, they only type
---
and love to kill the building hype.
---
Change is good - or is it bad?
---
(doesn't matter cause now "u mad")
---
The only true way to be elite
---
is not log on or join a fleet.
---
Press F1 to unsubscribe
---
and read their online diatribe.
---
To the four houses they are a peeve - 
---
those who rant they *really* won Eve.
---
&gt; That said, don't take a destroyer to null to rat. You won't be able to, the rats will kill you.
---
What about low sec? I've fairly recently started taking an Algos and doing some low sec daytripping for clone soldier hunting.
---
This answer needs to be higher up.
---
I think it's a wonderful idea. I treat my ships like naval ships, so each one has a name and a story (even the noobship corvettes). I think it would be a lot of fun buying a ship and learning about its past history and past owners - it would definitely tie me closer to the EVE universe.
---
Nomads move around, so maybe you really are a nomad who likes to keep moving but keep trying to live like a hermit :)
---
Stop, my phantasm with only 34 killmarks can only get so erect!
---
Failed VR Project #3
---
Well you do have to wait ~2 minutes after 1st jump, then ~7, then 30 if you want to keep jumping around. Doesn't get higher than that though.
---
Ah yes, house [🐝GoonWaffe]
---
You also have fountain, it's somewhat active but if at EU tz, but you will be blobbed.
---
Only dockable citadels can be seen in structure browser.
---
I didn't want to add mixed regions as they aren't really treated the same as fully-npc ones.
---
You should be on CCP's art department.
---
So I used to be able to jump from empire low sec to any edge of the map in 3 or 4 jumps. 
---
How long would it take to go from low sec Caldari Space to the top of Tenal or bottom of Delve? I used to make that run weekly. How many hours and jumps with max skills?
---
Now this is quality content.
---
That only works on minmatar ships
---
Love the premise. I spent years following specific and Nuanced goals for myself and have had a great time playing solo, as well as in corporations depending on my goal at the time. 
---
First goal was to throw away everything I had an be entirely self sufficient.. starting again with no isk and a rookie ship I mined enough to buy a box for a venture and basic mining equipment. I then focused on building everything I fly and use and built up my bpo collection. 
---
Once I needed some new excitement I decided I want to build a rorqual in the furthest reaches. I moved to the furthest part of stain and moved all my bpos there to setup my main base. After achieving that goal and establishing myself I decided on  and, cause you can imagine how hard it was to import the things I couldn’t harvest there. 
---
Next it was wormhole space so I joined a good Corp to help me learn it. 
---
And so forth, many goals since then and have had a ton of fun. I’ve met so many cool people along the way and haven’t been isolated even though I play “solo”.
---
Make your own goals and enjoy what you do. I endorse OP message. 
---
Jimbo Thrasher
---
You do can that now.
---
the number of people that log in =/= the number of people online and playing.
---
Can't you just not shoot them if they pay?
---
&gt;  I cant play the game for an amount of time
---
On the flip side, do you feel it is healthy for the game to allow suppers and titans to get to the other side of eve in 6 mins?
---
Is it so bad that your sub-cap fleet has to hold the field for 6mins wilst you mid the caps?
---
yes - and we aren't talking about those numbers.
---
he said people that don't log in have been replaced - and since the number of people that are logged in, the PCU, is down... who has replaced them?
---
You can export and import them via PYFA.
---
Why would you want to encourage something that always has and always will suck so much ass?  The only thing that's fun about bloc level warfare is getting to brag about it after the fact.  The actual warfare resembles paint drying and occasional timers were we do a dumb-ass dance like two dogs circling each other and growling until one of them gets scared and runs.  And that's the best case.  The worst case if you end up in some server busting snooze fest that lasts for hours.
---
Fozziesov was a valiant attempt at breaking up server choking blobs, but it was fatally flawed from the start.  So is the ADM system where the only way to strengthen your claim to your space is by crabbing your ass off.
---
If they got rid of the artificial sov mechanics and rated the strength of your sov to how much control you actually have of the space it'd go a long way.  Block wars could be fought through many tactical engagements of all sizes over time, instead of mechanics that force server-busting stand-offs at a single point of attack.
---
The way that it might work would be straight up points system.  Kill a hostile ship in your space, you get awarded a number of points based on the class of ship.  Lose a ship to hostiles in your space, and you lose points.  Activities like mining and ratting that put you in space and at risk earn you points.  Hostiles doing the same in your space loses you points.  Losing structures would cost you points.  Killing hostile structures would gain you points.  That should be enough to give you the idea.  How strong someone's sov is would wax and wane given how they're actually doing at controlling their space.  Make it impossible to anchor defensive structures like cyno-jammers until a certain strength of sov is reached.
---
The above would give blocs, or any entity, a reason to attack or defend across a very wide area.
---
The other thing that should happen is to do away with structure spam.  Limit citadels to one Keep per constellation, one fort to a system, one astra to a grid.  
---
Do the above, and you'll give the average joe player a reason to form a gang and go kill the enemy on his turf, instead of waiting around for the poobah FC to form the golden fleet.
---
If you want to encourage bloc warfare, you have to start by making it not suck ass.
---
Username checks out.
---
&gt; Yes and no. Cap alts still took time to train and supply was limited
---
Not really, actually. Right before injectors, future skill farmers were making many cap, ratting, and mining alts to sell them on the bazaar. I will fully admit it wasn't as bad as injectors made it, but we'd still get here eventually.
---
What, and how long ago was the first generally recognised fleet doctrine fit?
---
Do not look at points on zkill. They are meaningless.
---
He was just pointing something out man. 
---
Beyond that it's a tad rich to talk about losing space with a Brave flair.
---
Yeah probably like 4-5h each way. http://evemaps.dotlan.net/jump/Thanatos,555/Anin:1-SMEB  
---
Just out of curiosity, why did you do it weekly? And why in a carrier? Lately I've been doing a fun thing where I buy discount caps, full them up to the rafters with subcaps if I see good deals on them nearby and then jump them home for resale. But I don't go that far, maybe 2-3 jumps.
---
I’m not a coder/programmer so maybe it is harder than I imagine. Figured it would be some code and server storage space but I dunno. 
---
I do keep this myself but sometimes records become muddled and sometimes you have he same ship in different locations. Would be nice to be tracked in game. 
---
Very cool about the buyer you connected with. I sent a message to the jf I sold just to let them know what I went through to produce it. what if you could edit a stack’s info to include a not when you buy or mass produce! Very cool.
---
I do the same, with naming conventions and of course certain special names which last throughout the years! 
---
I don’t think you’d want it automated, like default show the person who created it or some stupid shit like auto added info, but if you choose to put something in there good stuff.
---
FUCKING DAMN IT! Now I need to spec into a Hel, there is no negotiating this now.This is amazing we need more tbh. Also CCPlease gib player masks
---
Yea there are guides to restoring security status all over the intranet. Good luck.
---
Ditto, join a Corp
---
Many reasons why this would be pointles. The biggest is, locking up a friend to give him 3 minutes of pvp invulnerable. 
---
Even 10 seconds is to much, lock up your cyno alt, pay the fee, warp on top of some juicy targets and cyno. Your alt can't be locked for 10 seconds so you would have 6 or 8 seconds of invulnerable cyno.
---
Jump freighters and rorquls have 90% fatigue reduction. You would only do it in a carrier if you hated your self.
---
yes it was healthy for the game, it required a lot of effort and time it never happened in 6 minutes. Just the training it took to be able to fly those ships took most people years to achieve. This was before the pay to train money grab CCP installed, I guess that ran out for them as expected.
---
It took hours to prep for or days or weeks, and even the doing it things were always going not to plan. 
---
On the other end of it you always had fear of loss to help control the very dumb things people would do with Capitals like ratting even if you were doing it and got dropped on and didn't have a cyno fit on your ship to get help then it was your fault. 
---
Everyone feared PL and the "teams" that could manage all this and be effective, fear of loss made the game worth playing.
---
If I can fly around in a officer fit smart bombing Mach for years making 32 bil a day farming anomalies you might think  that would be something CCP needed to fix quicker then adding space aids to the game. 
---
I had no empire I was just a simple PVP pilot that needed to haul things to a combat zone in my carriers or if I was unlucky and really needed haul fuel for POS's for someone else in JF's. 
---
I don't just not trust CCP as game developers I don't trust them as human-beings.
---
It wasn't meant for people to.live in wspace in the first place
---
I did it at the end of the weekend of combat before going to work being the USA in the west coast it was the quiet time in the game. So I would jump back to take all things I needed to sell and come back with all the things I needed to fight sometimes other people needed help to get something somewhere so they could sell it and plex their account. So when the nerfs happened all the people that needed my help to keep playing lost that ability.
---
You can play as alpha to the moment, when you encounter limitations, that needs you an omega status. Of course, it's possible to grind isk for plex, but it's or too time consuming, or your gameplay is highly efficient in terms of getting isk. So, if you need something, that needs an omega, you better pay for that.
---
So we just have to flip the donuts over and no more blue donut.
---
I thought Drifters where going to make eve into a Blood Bagel.
---
I was originally pulled to this game when I watched a random video that popped up on my feed about the Battle of B-R5RB. I was instantly mesmerized. The domino effect followed as I nosedived into this game. 
---
My one goal: To fly an Avatar titan in a titanic battle between alliances. The road to this goal is long, and maybe this game will die by then, or maybe those type of battles just wont happen anymore. Regardless, I will work for as long as needed to make it happen. Let's hope for the best.
---
Considering it takes effort to run into more dangerous people, that’s a low bar to set. It takes a week at most to mark all dangers in a lowsec pocket.
---
Your question is pointless. Why should people do anything in a sandbox?
---
Null seems to be too safe because people organized and concentrated power. Instead of whining, that you can't fuck with that power with a small gang bring more power.
---
Space aids is really only space chlamydia now
---
Yeah but all it would have really taken is for one of the noobs to have a friend who was more experienced to setup a trap for this guy or something. More elaborate stuff has happened. I am not saying it was elite pvp or something but its not something to be "ashamed" of.
---
They disbanded because leadership went afk.
---
The longer I stare at this statement the worse it gets....

Yeah definitely check out rorquals then, I have one that I use as a ghetto JF, max cargo expanded it fits over 200k m3 of stuff, plus has a fairly useless SMB that takes only industrial ships, but you can still fill them up with ammo, cap boosters and such. And they are very affordable, bought mine for 1.8b, whereas a carrier costs ~900m, but a JF over 8b, and comparatively a month of Omega time is 2b.  
---
The same trip in a Rorq would take maybe half an hour if you have the cynos in place.
---
It’s not something to brag about either. It’s something you do and silently enjoy, like the vast majority of activities in online games.
---
That is up to personal taste and opinion. This guy didn't post this saying LOOK AT THESE LEET KILLS I AM PVP GOD! He just said he hit 999 killmarks. Yeah it was low-grade effort on the actual kills but took persistence and time to accomplish. And he felt like sharing that. Its not something I am going to remember long term anyway nor will anyone here getting a rage boner over him sharing it.

Underrated comment of the year
---
You seem to not understand that “personal taste and opinion” doesn’t absolve you of the right to get mocked for public acts.
---
You enjoy something in your friends’ group and I’ll actively attack people that go out of their way to mock you for doing something you harmlessly enjoy. You place your boogers on a display in a sound state of mind - you give up any right to call mockery of the act a “rage boner”.
---
Whatever dude, plenty of people here thought what he accomplished was fun enough to point out. Everyone else is expending too much energy caring so much. But that is the EvE crowd summed up in a nutshell.
---
I believe we're squibs.
---
Welldone. Keep up the learning Eve needs more content creators and FCs.
---
Nah think of it as the US Democrat and the Republicans, the media will make you believe we about to go in a civil war , but when you meet people in your daily life , unless you blatantly ask them which side there on , you would never know and most people in the US are moderate, so most players in eve are pve and pvp.

I had similar issue with bomb launcher.      
---
Could not pull charges in any way (docked or undocked)        
---
When i was docked i was trying to unfit launcher using the dropdown menu ... even if the launcher have landed in my cargo with the charges ... it was still visible in fitting fully loaded and prevented from any change to this slots, the CPU/PG use stayed the same.          
---
After 1st relog i was able to exit the bomber and and after the 2nd relog (not in the ship) i was able to board it again and it had no longer bomb launcher.                    
---
I was dumb and in hurry and i did not make a EBR, but maybe this will give hint CCP what potentially is the issue.
---
It's ok salty mcsaltsdude
---
the comms orders were "fuck the supers, tackle the titans"
---
The multiple and single account players haven't unsubbed yet because their sub didn't expire yet.
---
The game is turning into a major cash grab, that's why it's getting to worthless and dev calculated too much risk to farm anything in any way other than with a credit card.
---
How can we tell that those who sell isk for plex are even players and not NPC's designed to make farming by players worth even less?
---
Maybe they're taking lessons from Bigpoint, who knows.
---
They are the biggest power bloc in the game, but still, somehow, always manage to be the victim....
---
Oh im not even close to that good but wouldnt it be a great place to work?
---
Reading is fundamental to understanding
---
yeah though you might need to have a more expansive definition of "water" past a certain point.
---
You had a goal in mind, you went to achieve that goal, and you lead some nerds, to include capital ships, in order to achieve it. Good job, and good job for taking the initiative for content creation.
---
Keep taking these small gangs/fleets out, there's plenty of objectives to take and achieve!
---
Looks better than the ship in the game.
---
&gt; Is there any real counter-play to this besides just having more titans
---
triage
---
the third avatar was hovering at about 25% armor for quite awhile due to triage. a few additional triage would have saved it, and the rest of the armor titans.
---
nothing was saving that shitfit rag tho. t1 guns, t1 rigs, no refits.
---
&gt; these days snuff is blue-ish to frat.
---
we are?
---
Actually thos ones pretty tiny around a5 size, i recently ruined a couple of a3 pads so ive been trying to use the rest of the space on them just getting myself back into the swing of things
---
Pvp and looking pretty?
---
Debating your idea would imply that it has merit. It doesn't. 
---
This thread is just a bunch of butthurt krabs who have been on the receiving end of good ganks, but have no idea of how much risk and effort is involved to set it up. Come join a blops team for a few weeks and then see how you feel about it.
---
No, but you shouldn't need lvl5 of magic 14 for t1 frigs dessies and cruisers, lvl4 should max out their hp, fitting and cap.
---
The module random offline issue has been there for ages. 
---
CCP did not fix it.
---
Amazon.eve
---
choose an escape warp location in the same direction of your bombing vector, saves align time.
---
you would have had enough time to actually make a book mark on the same grid here.
---
Except that it's not really chaos, but a calculated way to make warming worth less and credit card using a lot more frequent.
---
And for the economy regulating itself because of the bpigger risk, they can always put NPCs disguised as players to sell isk for plex on the market.
---
This game is becoming too much like another Bigpoint game.
---
yup, otherwise people like you call them cheapasses that "jerk over the pile of money they'll never use"
---
I kinda want to be angry at this post but you're 100% right lol

&gt; or do it so that they cant be locked for a period of time to prevent someone else from tackling them
---
i like it. i'll ransom my own jf and then go into highsec and be untouchable.
---
He obviously meant immune to lock from your ship not other peoples..
---
He meant the ransomer loses lock not everyone else..
---
Good idea, most people will argue and reee because trust should be a factor for them. Even though they have likely never ransomed or been ransomed, they don't understand what a big quality of life change this would be for small scale pirates.
---
As I see it, EVE is about freedom. You can target someone, lock him with warp disruptors and chat him up - pay up/drop your cargo or get bopped. Then it's up to you if you let him go or not. If you don't stay true to your word given to the wrong person/alt, you will quickly make some powerful enemies.
---
This is basically the same as any other profession that involves player interaction - it's about the players, not the game systems. You don't need a game-moderated system for something you can do already.
---
Pls help me understand how wormholes and null are exactly the same now

Just jump it to Ignoitton. You’ll get help there.

---

---
BEHAVIOUR
---
that's because CCP code is recursive and the cleaning is not always working. That is, when you empty your guns, sometimes there is a stack of ammos that is not removed from it in the DB. More precisely, the guns state is "clear" but the ammo stack keeps a position of "in the turret" meaning for some operations the turret may be empty or filled, depending on the code calling it.
---
Be sure to fill a bug report.
---
I had it visible when items appeared in phantom positions in the ESI. eg. Items were belonging to fits not existing anymore. I think some CCP dev fixed it but never sure …
---
It's summer, happens every year, you sound like a knob.
---
Well i usually fill the bug reports, like i said i was dumb in hurry and did forgot to fill the bug report.
---
look whats next to the ship "eye"
---
It would hurt smaller guys once again more then the big coalitions.. Guess what would happen.. Goons all ready have npc station next door.. Test would stomp stain to save their shit there.. Panfam would save their stuff up north or greater wildland(or hows it called) and now guess what would happen after.. Right they start farm the structures from the smaller guys..
---
i remember when i stopped playing eve shortly after the war gotg had with drone b team in perrigen falls things weren't all that great. Zack got kicked because of some bullshit with sort which is why i left. that knocked out the core fc dept since he and i were the only super active ones. after that it looks like things went to shit and eventually after moving to etherium they simply fell apart.
---
hell yeah.
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/77783584/
---
This is a really good idea. So simple cant believe hasn't been suggested earlier, could be easy to exploit, limit to subcaps, 15 secs invulnerability
---
Hard disagree.
---
CAN I HAVE YOUR STUFF ???
---
Avoid joining the big null sec blocks, you'll just end up another number and wont actually make any friends, join a small Corp, get to know people build trust.
---
Yeah you could. But you would have to be dumb to rat with two people, one of which being a sabre pilot, in local.
---
Domination arti Loki.
---
I meant to say room temperature, touche.
---
&gt;But it's not fair that my VNI was ganked by a single cloaky Loki. I want that CONCORD be deployed to nullsec and they blap off every neutral that enter in system so that I can make the dankest ticks safely
---
Nobody has ever asked for/complained about this. There are tens of threads each week complaining about caps being dropped on poor little roaming gangs. There aren't any complaining about what you're trying to pretend people complain about.
---
&gt;so that I can jerk off at my huge pile of Titans that I never use.
---
If you have a Titan you aren't VNI ratting. Also the vast majority of players don't have caps, let alone titans. Stop this weak narrative.
---
Why does everybody want to go into the meat grinder? There’s other space to explore where you’ll learn more in less time. Lowsec or WH groups are usually much tighter and many of them will gladly teach you the ropes. You can have more than one mentor ;)
---
Imagine getting tackled in a ratting super lmao.
---
Looting the wrecks of your enemy is pretty relaxing.
---
Appreciate the advices bro.
---
Im like 20days of getting a T2 heavy drone..i do have the other skills.
---
But yes , im still very fresh in the game :)
---
I think i will stay way from C3 until i can get T2 drones and just go for C2 with my gila :)
---
Already saw it! Thanks bro :)
---
Hey guys a noob question. I'm planning to buy the starter pack for myself And give my friend some extra referral plex (350 I think), since I was reffered by him. The starter pack gives omega and 110 plex. 
---
Does anyone know if buying the 15 usd starter works for getting referral rewards? Or will I have to buy an omega subscription directly? 
---
And also is omega like an item u can drag onto ur character and not use instantly if I don't want to use it right away?
---
WTF is the point of your spreadsheet if it does not fetch the variable data by itself ?
---
I joined early 2018 and left end 2018. Was my first null sec alliance. It turned eve into my #1 game and I learned a lot. Thanks KOS
---
And this my Friends, is how a FC is born !
---
There is no way that the server could handle that sort of load.
---
w&lt;hat's the hard limit ? 20b is okay but not 21b ?
---
&gt;laughs in small gang
---
Not gonna say adapt or die because that’s a bullshit mantra, this is just a game. If the game isn’t what you want it to be anymore then it might be a good time to take a break and re-evaluate. 
---
You never know, you may come back at some stage with a renewed love for the game.
---
Works as a blue donut reference as well as CCP polishing a turd.
---
I want to shoot them even if they do.
---
Gorgeousness
---
I like this idea. It could be as simple as the game marking the ship with the builder's name (like Abyssal modules are), and then a storing a list of unique pilots in order of who sat in the ship. If you repackage the ship, the history list would be wiped (I believe the Eve database doesn't store unique data about packaged items).
---
He also acknowledges the fact that it could be good if you get used to it. Don't see a problem with that.
---
So wait. 
---
Someone tackles my :          
---
* carrier        
---
* super      
---
* rorqual      
---
* titan      
---
* freighter     
---
* whatever else          
---
I can use a alt/friend to use the "ransom mechanic" on me and for like 1.000.000 ISK in ransom gain 3 minute invulnerability to others tackling me?                       
---
NICE ... actually no, it is not nice.
---
Fun fact: When you are away for many months (certainly when it was 6 years), you can petition a GM to move you. Load all your stuff into the biggest ship and wait to get moved.   
---
I know this advice comes a bit late, but I just wanted to mention it, because the game can be tough in situations like yours and CCP is acknowledging it.
---
Yea, this. It's not that maintaining ADMs is impossible. With defensive fleets up and such it can be done.
---
However the blackout has made that work incredibly tedious, and it's not like it wasn't tedious as fuck to begin with. At least before the blackout you could make semi decent ISK out of ADM farming. But now, the combination of: lower base income due to refitting/reshipping defensively, having to organize and split income with PVP protection, and the fact that nearly uncatchable blops drops *will* kill your PVE ships several times a day... the whole thing is just a very undesirable PVE activity.
---
It's become a very high-effort, high-risk, and low-income activity. Which is obviously going to drive most people away. - The only exception I've seen is when you have R64 moons to mine, but those are few and far in between. Not nearly enough to sustain even a fraction of the null-sec player base.
---
For people interested in PVP the chance of catching and killing blops has gone up, and blapping roaming groups is always fun, but that's small comfort for PVE focused players. They are still facing a decision where almost all other options are going to work out better for them.
---
Show me on the doll where the bittervet touched you
---
Surprise you arent using the multi-billion active phantasm, 1k dps tank with medium neut cap stable. Only pumps out 500 dps though.
---
&gt;How is the game for someone who doesnt have a bunch of time to gaming (a couple of hours a day, maybe not even that).
---
Very friendly, you put skills in a queue that runs in realtime
---
Just put a long skill at the end and you will not miss much when not online.

I will leave a few words here.

PS as to the unspoken question of your's and many others here "Funny how? Funny like a clown. Do you amuse me?"

Yes. Yes you do. The only question is, will you and others continue to do so? I bet yes!
---
It's both to be fair, quoted from politics dictionary : 14 refers to David Lane, a notorious white supremacist leader and murderer, who at one point issued the 14-word statement: “We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.” Lane, who was incarcerated for various crimes including the assassination of a Jewish radio host, wrote his infamous words in 1985 while in prison (he ultimately died in prison in 2007). The number 88 refers to the fact that H is the eighth letter of the alphabet, so 88 is HH. This stands for “Heil Hitler,” part of the historic Nazi salute. Essentially, 1488 is a callback to these two figures and their racist ideologies.
---
With these blue modules that are way better than they yellow/orange ones
---
I can't believe someone hasn't written a bot program for autopiloting yet. This kind of botting would literally be undetectable, mindlessly clicking the jump button whilst drooling on my desk would be indistinguishable from a bot doing it.
---
Succinct and accurate!
---
&gt;I  also should point out about 5 ish years or so ago you didnt have to train say amar frigits or cruisers you trained cruisers 
---
Destroyer and Battlecruiser where one skill for all. You just needed Frigate / Cruiser to III to fly those two ship classes.
---
That was changed long ago
---
Doesn't matter.
---
That sounds incredible boring to use
---
&gt; Just like doing mwd then cloak 
---
You mean cloak then mwd ? The cloak trick works like that : first you cloak then you have a few sec to activate any other mods
---
From what I remember the leadership was AFK for a long time, but many line members were active. Then Goons started to cloaky-camp everywhere and with no one to keep the morale up the numbers started dwindling. More and more people simpy didn't log in. Then the faction fortizar deal happend. I guess some members weren't very happy about it, the lack of PvP content and that they were expected to farm ISK. There was talk about the roots of the alliance being PvP. Some time later a rather small group of members decided to leave the coalition and head east to pew-pew. Those who didn't want to do that were able to leave the alliance and stay in the coalition by joining other corps.
---
That's from perspective of a line member.
---
Depends, in fleet fights its bad, but small scale and 1v1 scenarios its stupidly OP. Great for the event sites that involve a lot of suspect baiting.
---
Yeah, it's over, and you had to buy the deal on the account management page.  If you're already subbed CCP said "lol fuck you we don't care, this is for more numbers!"
---
I quit this garbage and life is much better.
---
With the time won back I go out more often, do sports, fix things in the house and play a moba that seems to survive well without desperate cash grabbing and with no RL money that affects gameplay.
---
ej ziomeczku pamietasz, ze zawsze po ataku LOVE nastepnego dnia byl atak RAGE c'nie? no... to dzisiaj mam nadal LOVE...widzicie jak sie ladnie zmieniam i w ogole ;-*
---
&gt;It would hurt smaller guys once again more then the big coalitions
---
I'm curious because I sont actually know. How did people live in systems before citadels were a thing?
---
Yeah, i think that's what people don't understand. That's where our true strength lies, our organizational structure.
---
Then who cares? Attackers would still get loot sometimes, which is better than they do now.
---
Yeah, though I'm very curious to know when people started defining them as such, like, 'slippery petes', etc.
---
&gt;I will never return to Eve
---
Thank you
---
Are you sure? I day trip in an Astero for relic/data sites and I'd love to meet this Rattlesnake.
---
Post the list somewhere and ask people to tell you, if they see any of them, for a small price.
---
Also bringing up Arya isnt probably the best approach, since she failed to kill so many on the list. Didnt kill the inbred king,or his mother, or her bodyguard, or his brother, or the man who beheaded Ned
---
I am in a similar boat as you, with the exception that my entire group decided to get back together and start playing again.
---
If you’re interested in joining some fellow older players, let me know.
---
It's very hard to kill a specific person in EVE since the game mechanics mean that you will never kill someone who's aware of your intention and doesn't want to fight you. Most solo fights are completely opportunistic so you're likely to never get the opportunity to kill a specific player.
---
Well this would be an update 🤣
---
&gt;don’t get the numbers to even unsafely and smartly make much isk
---
Ok? Maybe they should move out of null. 
---
We dont tell random 30 man corps to come to c5 space to get sweaty armor brawls. You're relegated to what you can do.
---
who
---
I mean, they’ve always kinda been that way...just different kinda names.
---
I guess the first really big one I can remember that had its own identity was probably the old drake w/ hml.
---
Although I can’t for the life of me remember what they were called.  This was nullsec around probably 2010-11ish they really started making their debut?
---
This was also before the missile changes which were a direct result of that doctrine
---
Personally, I put my $$$ in a SP500 ETF.
---
Wow haha I'm amazed you remember! Hope you're doing well
---
most of the goon pets are just actual members who setup their own tax farms and recruit from ingame channels, tests' is just pure shitters who have somehow conglomerated on their own
---
and who created all the modules and ships that person uses in PVP, who farms the isk from the faucets to put into the economy allowing pvpers to sell their loot, game is reliant on both pve and pvp, both are equally valid and people like yourself are a cancer to the game, so blinded by your superiority you can't see that every single person in new eden all contribute to the world we all play in. Idiot.
---
You haven't been to Black Rise in the past two or three weeks, have you?
---
It's generally been either completely dead or the Villore Accords showing up for an un-fun fight. Along with Hull Penetration and Panic Attack running battleship fleets (easy to avoid, but annoying to get smartbombed upon going through a gate) and Snuffed Out bringing capitals down on frigates. I haven't found many good fights recently, sadly.
---
Your flair is Goonswarm. Your dudes camping out in Frarie also scared some people off from Placid/Black Rise area. Thanks for bashing those structures, though. I don't like those people, but I'd get in trouble with Diplo if I shot at any structures. Usually the only Goons around are some Balkan Kings guys who like smartbombing gates.
---
Init would find it easy I’d guess.
---
link your km
---
Hey, similar story, I played a lot in 2014 and have tried to start playing again a few times.
---
Personally I tried horde 3 times and didn't find them a good fit. Nothing against them, if you want content and headlong diving into the enemy, that's there. You can just follow pings, login and boom content. I've not played with them since November 18 though, things might have changed now they've moved again.
---
I've recently resubbed again and joined TEST. I'm loving it here, I much prefer the infrastructure, resources guides and setup here, it just feels "right" to me. We're in a war right now, I have pings every day for fleets I'm not around to go on. I've not setup any squads or stuff yet, but there's more pings I'm missing out on I know.
---
If you don't like the idead of that, then there's goons you could go for too.
---
If you're short on IRL time atm and just want a bit of ping warrior content, personally id recommend one of those big null 3.
---
What makes you think they may be unsuitable? Horde definitely sees a lot of PvP at all levels so without knowing your concerns it's hard to help.
---
This is all according to Hillmar and Co plan. Shake up nullsec. None will survive unless they already have a supercap fleet. All for the good of new players........
---
Disbanded because of drifters and black out.

    As part of ongoing maintenance of the Tranquility cluster and its associated services, we will need to extend daily downtime next Tuesday, July 30th.
---
    
---
    Downtime will begin at the regular time of 11:00 UTC and will run for a total of 60 minutes.
---
    We expect Tranquility to be back online and accepting connections at 12:00 (noon) UTC.
---
    Apologies in advance for any inconvenience that this extended downtime may cause. We'll try to have Tranquility back online as soon as possible!
---
AAR is in the video
---
I held my breath reading this.
---
L5s?
---
That was fun :-). The swipe at Star Citizen will be much appreciated by that community.
---
There was a talk during one old fanfest where one CCP dude claimed that newbros who get killed during their first two weeks are more likely to stay in the game.
---
because the simpler was to change the code in the eve program to warp at 0 for autopilot instead of warp at 8000
---
Not really. Last major fight where everyone seemed to be present Test and Goons were on opposite sides (some 3rd party keepstar this spring). Didn't really change anything except some snide remarks on the different podcasts and then it was back to normal.
---
It's al about what is about to get hit.
---
Clone soldier tags is the fastest way to repair sec.. like instantly
---
All I'm doing is typing something that's as dumb as what you typed.
---
Why nullsec? Join fw in lowsec. A lot more action than "align" and "F1".
---
It's all cool, but changing all those things will just shift flavour of the game towards something else, at which point having more of that flavour manned by more people will still dominate territorial wars.
---
Giving more leeway to roamers is nice and all, but will change nothing in the grand scheme of things.
---
I half agree with you, but, as a consumer the only thing we can do is voice our issues and then vote with our wallet.
---
Doesn't CCP have a "why are you leaving" survey when you unsubscribe anyway? It's not as if they don't listen to community feedback from time to time.
---
Would probably improve the coffee we get at my work. thanks for the idea.
---
My post is a reflection of the posts we see here and the fact that many "hunters" are risk averse (all the caps need nerfing, Loki is fine threads) and not very skilled, as evidenced by posts complaining about warp stabs etc after the blackout. 
---
Your post is not reflective of anything posted here 
---
Do you see the difference?
---
It works if bought through the CCP online store directly - if you buy from some other source like greenman or amazon it does not.  
---
As soon as you purchase it becomes active, the ingame rewards can be redeemed whenever to a character of your choosing
---
Yes it is clear you scared of us
---
I saw "Falcon" and "leaves CCP" and was filled with sadness... then noticed it was EveOnion. :D
---
I think it is related to how many are on the kill. 
---
Solo kills are worth more than gang kills.
---
But i won't sweat it too much. The metric is less than ideal.
---
The two actual backstabs we had done in the last three years are indeed well documented,  no arguing there. 
---
However, other than those SNUFF operates on a very open "one op at a time, subject to following the agreements" basis of cooperation with anyone.  
---
At the same time  member corporations also have their own agendas, and as long as those provide alliance as a whole with content,  no one is going to stop them.
---
 For example,  if one of our Russian corps decides they want to fight the Russians due east, they may get access to the citadels of those who fight those Russians. The owners of the citadels will get that corp assisting them, but they also will be well aware that only that one corp will be doing that, in their own free time. At the same time members of other corps would not be such inclined. 
---
All this is not a secret. There are no hidden agendas or devious plots. We will fight anyone, together with anyone,  as long as that provides content. And those calling us in get a fleet to gelp them out for one fight. There are risks, byt tgen again, due to history and tge way we work - those risks are known in advance and can be prepared for.
---
Totally impossible while landing in site, and bridging hics while exiting warp
---
there are plantz of hisec exploration bots that use somekind of program like that
---
I think we should keep these but lets remove attributes and let all skills train the same. Too easy to fuck yourself with the attributes if you try to minmax and end up being forced to train up vital skills with shit speed.
---
MASB hawk ?
---
Did you ask the FC if you can bring it first?
---
We have loads of content, both in terms of standing fleet and posted ops.
---
No activity requirements, so you should be just fine.
---
This will just make the big bloc powers more powerful.
---
Trash tier, vengeance op :D
---
Not enough spinning
---
As someone in your situation I have just joined horde and would give a resounding Yes as the answer to your question.
---
Plenty of activity, loads of help if needed.
---
Best decision I made in the last 6 years of Eve.
---
youve lost these hulls in the last 3 years. meaning you kept this one in this area for a reason.
---
not shitting on ya, nice to see what it looks like tbh. but, presuming, this hull. only in starter area lowsec. with a falcon and logi bro on grid. i mean, you got there, but lost everything that makes this really cool in the process :(
---
Rorquals already mine for less than boosted Exhumers. Instead of nerfing single rorquals just make their mining more engaging so you can't multibox a lot of them.
---
But I thought it's already a blue donut?
---
Did you try to repackage the JF?
---
Not sure about history but for me they fixed it in 2 days and I got 50k for my troubles so I probalby got more than I would've if it had worked.
---
why accept it. just delete it. fml
---
personally i contract stuff i need kept aside from my hanger temporarily to an alt. never tried to myself lol....
---
once im done i delete contract then sort through it after :)
---
I just wanna blow shit up.
---
So how long are we gonna play this game of me calling you a moron and you trolling me? Just curious.
---
Jesus Christ dude, lol
---
Most people don't dislike PvEers but PvEers have had the upperhand for a while now and that has made the "hunters" come here to complain. Most people do a little bit of both.
---
try not offlining your expanders next time :)
---
What is this ? And how can I join ?
---
&gt; only in starter area lowsec. with a falcon and logi bro on grid.
---
Never used Falcon or Logi alts flying the Phantasm. When I still had my Fiend everyone told me to get a FAX alt. I refused because that's not how I fly.
---
Horde has a good rep of giving good fights, mainly because we do not drop cap on every thing that moves. We also have a white list of fc's, so a lot of streamers come to play. Our standing fleet is very active because of this. Once your with us for 60 days our sigs will be open to you, giving a host of fleets and a few different deployments to choose from. You will find solid content in any time zone and then there are strat op to keep you busy as well.
---
....when did I ever claim that wasn't a problem too?
---
Not every decision made has to be perfect and problem free. It just needs to be well reasoned.
---
with not much time to spare the game will feel slow. 
---
but to be fair, the first 3-6months are basicly waiting for skills to train so should be easy. after that, the game is for sure still worth playing!
---
Not gonna lie, he had us in the first half of the title
---
jesus this title gave me a heart attack
---
Yes, so then the problem with changing it now is that those that were positioned properly at that time were able to get an insurmountable advantage over those just a little bit behind.
---
L4 fw
---
I’d love star citizen to have some more eve like ships!
---
&gt;I'm not talking about the allies who can actually stand on their own two feet like tikle and init,
---
 Guess you missed this bit.
---
Waste of dev time ? No. 
---
Thank to proof again you are useless and you jsut post to trashtalk.
---
Pvp us dead!
---
Specialy in the big coalitions.
---
Salty? Lololol. What is there to be salty about? Some nobodies not getting kills? Nope lol.
---
Not sure if warp disrupt probes will honor a ransom.
---
You are providing a good example why this should never be a thing though: It is a pointless idea and doesn't offer anything you can't already do, but people are theorycrafting on how to exploit it already :)
---
Shocked, truly I am! It's not like they have been in FW since LP for plexing became a thing. And don't forget the FW bots that run FW missions which have no impact on FW at all apart from devaluing FW LP.
---
yeh, am i missing somthing or doesnt the market show every purchasable BPO in the game (not T2 BPO's as they cannot be bought on the market or made
---
I mean, if you can't kill PvE ships you are just bad. Because everyone knows you aren't trying to engage in PvP with players in actual PvP ships. If you were, you wouldn't bug out at first sign of them.
---
you know you want to...
---
Eveonion have a malware on you're computer who read you're spam. 
---
Check if you have a spam like " Found you're gaming company for only 100 000$".
---
But Init can't though, so he was right.
---
So... what happens when you kill the 1000th ship? Does it get reset or something?
---
a helious has 1 volley worth of HP from a proteus.... why not blap and run instead of run?.
---
always take the bait
---
I was giddy with gladness until I saw ut was an onion article.
---
Could you explain this sigs to me? Does that mean I can't joijn everything under 60 days?
---
Ask Hard Knocks.
---
The self proclaimed newbie is proved fake because he's never posted before.
---
Try and wrap your two brain cells around that one bud.
---
Perhaps a stupid question, but don't the scimitars have the range to rep tackle near zero if they sat with the brutixes at say 40km off? That'd put the brutixes further into the mach's falloff (negating dmg for logi to rep), while the rails still hit easily within optimal.
---
You mean Init, who batphoned GSF?
---
That while blackout brings some problems it has also brought some positive changes; more group and less solo play is a good thing.  
---
I hope that enough botting is being stopped across EVE that the ISK return for real player ops goes up - so the reward for risking your ships is not just about the feels.
---
Nah a different INIT.
---
another quality piece of hard hitting journalism.  
---
*Missed an opportunity to use the falcon middle finger picture though...that feels more N-EVE.*
---
Yes, those players who do both PVE and PVP contribute a lot to the world. 
---
Purely PVE players are just above NPC rats. They don't contibute in the destruction of the stuff they create except by losing ships now and then. They also make the value of modules/isk/ships lower so rest of us can't earn as much from pve/industry. Eve would be better game if everyone did both pve and pvp.
---
I've also heard, don't know how true these stories are, that spies from Imperium/PanFam were seeded into KOS leadership intentionally to sow discord.
---
Same here buddy, same here.
---
Sigs are special interest groups.
---
Most likely this 60 day thing is for opsec. You can join a lot of fleets but maybe some special ones with heavier assets may be blocked.
---
You have proven that you are an idiot.
---
There is no reason you cannot source the info on your own. 
---
You believe that doing this would not take dev time? You are stupid.
---
If it is so easy to get this information for you, then DO IT YOURSELF LIKE EVERYONE ELSE DOES.  I swear, you are an imbecile.
---
You may think I'm not being constructive, but if I were to encourage your bad behaviour, that is called enabling.
---
Thank you so much for the informative response!
---
CCP go in wrong way to have major block battle :
---
\-Test drifter attack force block to spam defense of gunner on bulding, so less people for frontline, and move fleet with drifter who could kill you're scout easy ... bad things, so block go in defense mode.
---
\-No local : You need more manpower to make intel, and beacause a lot of hunter was  thinking "YES we will have free kill", have more people in defense to manage the hunter who come more than usual. And you kill a lot of little entity of 0.0 who have less activity , and so less player to fight. Who open free space for block in some region if they want. So less thing to create an opression who will force a block to fight to be able to survive. 
---
CCP hope 0.0 will become destroy by vocal minority of roammer.  They have loose faith in big block massive war.
---
Yeah. It's kinda sad. If you can't fight any block then just Zerg the provi block that dosnt get in anyones way... And then, some cheast beating on Reddit.
---
No
---
Oh, that Init does not exist, especially in regards to HK.
---
I got ganked during my first week of playing and my goal become to learn how to pvp so I can fight back. Took few years but I eventually got there :)
---
We must be talking about 2 different INIT.'s my friend.
---
Thanks
---
Good analogy.
---
Boomerang
---
I think the goal is probably to figure out how to stay plex positive without stabbing himself in the head with a fork or running out onto the balcony and jumping off.
---
PCU, DCU and whatnot aside, the game is emptier every passing month.
---
One thing is sure, a change that attracts more hunters, makes their prey quit and forces everyone to either become a wallet warrior or leave the game won't do any good.
---
So you didn't read what I wrote or you would see I do know the risk and effort and wanted to alleviate some of it, particularly with new blops pilots putting a fleet at risk. Your response is a smooth rained "no bad" followed by " I say bad". Clearly fodder from the captain of the debate team.
---
I get it, do not think a cloak nerf is coming. That's fine, ignore things as they are. Please just don't complain when it happens in the most stupid binary way possible, because it was easier for CCP. Then again your complaint will be "change bad, me hate" and will be completely ignorable.
---
" There is no reason you cannot source the info on your own. "
---
I have already all data . 
---
" You believe that doing this would not take dev time? You are stupid. "
---
I said it's not a waste. AND for you're information you don't need a dev to make an index of all raw data, i think it's just a drag and drop in one link to post.  
---
" If it is so easy to get this information for you, then DO IT YOURSELF LIKE EVERYONE ELSE DOES.  I swear, you are an imbecile. "
---
I have already all information.  You proof you don't read me.
---
" You may think I'm not being constructive, but if I were to encourage your bad behaviour, that is called enabling. "
---
No you are not you don't read people. You are jsut a trashtalker.
---
Please read again the original post : It's an ask of improvemetn to permit to people who haven't the data actually to have a more easier access to it to have all people with same raw data and avoid thing like shitpost beacause people do'nt have all data as we have see recently in this reddit. 
---
Ho but maybe it's why you are unahppy. Less shitpost means less trashtalk.
---
My goal was the same as yours.  Unfortunately the group I'm with are so big and mean, the only comparable enemy ran away the last time we deployed and the big TIDI KS fights just don't happen.  I'm pretty sure without big changes they're never going to happen again.
---
Not really a bot. Just some dude who’s got alphas running ventures to claim easy FW Points.
---
nah if he’s risk averse he can just fit cloaks and kite fits to be safe like the other hunters :).
---
Plenty of hand holding safety to be had, and if he wants to pve plenty of krab wormholes to hide in or super umbrellas to live under
---
Falcon and hilmar listen to they beacause they have an important deadline with PA soon. They need to have more sub. 
---
So make a thing who attract hunter to resub is good for they . Beacause player sub don't stop the day of blackout and they wait end of sub... So basically during some weeks/month you have sub of hunter and remaning sub of indus/pve player. (umbrella are not touched).
---
The more op sec ones will be for blessed beans only.  There are plenty that are not though, check the fourm thread in general. That thread will have a list on non cap group sigs, join cap group if you have big toys to play with.
---
You could have petitioned CCP to move your stuff. Or you could have made a courier contract and pay someone to move your stuff to Jita. You took a huge risk and ended up losing your stuff. You didn't follow the first rule of Eve "Do not fly what you can't afford to lose." 
---
But you learnt a lesson and I'm sure next time you will be more careful out there. It's easy to make isk in current Eve so don't worry about it. You will easily recover.
---
Yes you can :
---
Astero for exploration and hunt Small explorer
---
Stratios for exploration and hunt all explorer
---
T3c cloaky to be on top of the food chain
---
Jokes on you, EVE has been in depression stage all the time
---
How exactly do you FW? I thought that was a corporation thing only? Can I participate if I'm solo?
---
Sorry but your use of "you're" is giving me cancer. All 3 should be "your" not "you are".
---
My guess is that we'll soon be seing eachother. I'll see you first and you'll see me when I decloak with friends.
---
 “I want a new game, and a new me to go along with my new hair”
---
Thirded. Not surprising about all the hate. I figure you taught new bros a lesson about Eve, working on your goal at the same time. There's a faction Phantasm waiting on the other side of every lowsec gate in highsec.
---
You shouldn't carry over 1bil in any freighter if you want to be safe, but people will cram their whole life in them and yolo thru 0.5 choke points and get popped soon as they enter. The ones watching already have scanned them, valued their cargo, cost of the gank, and have a fleet ready to go. It is like fishing, just never know what you might catch at times around Jita.
---
Spook level 100
---
I'd love to see ships with the list of all the people that used this particular one (and who produced it too)
---
HAHAHAHA "ejects 1000+ shuttles"
---
So if i bought the 15 usd starter pack from ccp website. Then got omega for myself. My friend should receive the 350 plex?
---
It's very common. Bots were a HUGE issue in FW about 9 months ago. A lot of them have disappeared but you still see them. 9 months ago there would be 1 in every 2nd system just about.
---
I do this for my alt fleet when I'm fleet warping 15 accounts around. Autopilot them all on the final warp to station and they all dock themselves.
---
Ho sorry you just understand you are wrong so you insult me. 
---
Maybe you need to make something inteligent and stop trashtalk.
---
you can also copy to clipboard and paste them into a textfile and save them that way but theres no reason we are limited that way ingame 
---
i shouldnt feel forced to stay in my alt corp just so i can save as many fits as i want
---
K
---
I think you guys just found the office joke for the next week
---
Yeah, I see no reason why this wouldn't work, maybe CCP should implement it, goes so well with their recent changes and what they announced for the future.
---
So how much did you spend on the new hairs? Don't even try to pass them off as homegrown.
---
Okay, so no more bounties for NPC kills to fund the defense!
---
Did you resub from alpha before you undock?
---
Sometimes after reaub, game doesn't see the omega skills imediatelly.
---
Try to pause and restart your skill queue.
---
Worked foe me in the past.
---
Courier contract so I could move a travel ceptor once I picked up my ship.
---
Pleaze die fast.
---
either way.... just cancel/delete or fail the contract.
---
and im pretty sure i tried to courier to myself and it wouldnt let me
---
well that is just short sighted and super gatekeepery way of looking at things. when you get older you might realise that they way you do things isn't the only way and doesn't make them less valid.
---
If they make this change people will either unsub all 50 of their accounts, or other people will resub all 50 of their accounts.
---
/u/ccp_falcon ... so asset danger?
---
More krab tears. 
---
“B-b-b-but my rating taxes pay for your SRP!”
---
Ecksdee
---
Like the venture ?
---
SPectre is no more npsi?
---
It got me back in the game as an alpha clone.  The test will be if I can have fun as a filthy casual.
---
It sounds like you're really mad about something, something CCP did to you, so you made up this bogus "REPENT!" thread.
---
That spinning shit needs to get nerfed.
---
Is there anyone here who could refer me? I think I could really need those 750K SP.
---
It's not a addiction fueled cash grab with much in common with gambling, I'm willingly supporting the game !
---
I think he did from the cancer you're spreading.
---
Shamelessly farming Karma, check out Phoneixx other videos he has a lot of cool dread bomb ones
---
Confirmed - am ded.
---
Lol so the non risk adverse flies a brawling mega and gets fucked on the first engagement by the horde of superior numbers. That’s not being brave that’s being utterly retarded.
---
Who the hell knows, I quit because the game was already shitty and most of my friends already quit.
---
PVE was already worthless gains for the time spent so I guess it wouldn't have been an improvement.
---
Stop using that shit malware-filled image sharing service...
---
WTF dude... How the hell you do not have Drone Durability maxed by now?! O.O
---
No access to the news page, but sounds interesting.    
---
More details?
---
Nice use of the ol' Texas Law salt. Clever :)
---
Condescension cracked me up too... brutal.
---
If I recall correctly, KOS didn't want to (or couldn't) pay for the space since a lot of active numbers already left due to cloaky camping and all that, including "the deal" coming to public knowledge which meant that motivations to stay were quite low as well. 
---
Then we tried to push into Etherium Reach with garbage feroxes and got stomped each night by Unspoken Alliances less than ten machariels, kudos to these guys :)  Some good fights were had but the carebearing people didn't have space where to grind and certain corporations were already leaving as soon as they would find alliance with solid null sec space. So after a week and half it was pretty much finished.
---
I expect it will be sales tax increase
---
Yep gotta agree with this. Can’t be that hard to expand each character’s saved fittings table in the database to 1,000 rows or something. Unless it lags out the fitting window of course.
---
Didnt they say they wanted to reduce bounties? More abyssals style, pve with guns to get materials to build things.
---
Yup, you're mad.
---
Ah well won't hurt to send them a ticket and ask nicely, there is still a second acc I can sub for 3 months :)
---
Well, I have all gunnery skills to lvl 5, all dreads other than caldari dread to 5, amarr Titan to 5. It wasn't something I used too often.
---
I liked to shoot things in the face directly.
---
Fucking wormhole scum! Go back to your hole! Only the big blocs make headlines, you jelly brah?
---
You ran out of arguments, even stupid nonsensical ones
---
&gt; *The DED's Star Marshal Kjersidur Elladall emphasized the importance of continuing to support capsuleer efforts through loyalty programs and support for accelerated training for those combating threats such as the Triglavians and Drifters.*  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; *The Amarr Empire and Gallente Federation have been particularly strong supporters of the proposals...*
---
Looks like Triglavians give loyalty points and skill boosters of some sort in the near future, maybe more specifically Amarr and Gallente as noted.
---
Slight correction it is not N-EVE it is infact Na-EVE.
---
This is how they word "*doing something different with drifters or triglavians*".
---
Yesterday I saw one in almost every system that's not high traffic in Amarr vs Minmatar.
---
You called our fc trash 
---
Proceeds to dump a fuckton of dreads to the garbage bin...this was the test invasion XD
---
Faction Warfare has bots in it? People figured out how to farm the LP? WHY I NEVER!
---
Lol ah yes. Let’s not be able to sneak up on anything ever.. yes much risk very wow.
---
No arguments are needed as you presented nothing worth arguing, it's just terrible krab clown rage.
---
Specially for /u/StainGuy:
---
 
---
Yulai, Genesis – Debate in the CONCORD Assembly of a proposed "New Eden Defense Fund" in a weekend-long special session has been marked by strong support for action to bolster New Eden defenses against the Triglavian invasion and other threats.
---
The New Eden Defense Fund proposals outline an extensive program of works to improve planetary and colony defenses, and enhance the defensive and offensive capabilities of vital installations. The CONCORD Inner Circle referred the defense fund proposals from the DED and AEGIS to the full assembly, with a recommendation to set up the fund, but left details of sourcing the necessary monies to representatives of all member states.
---
AEGIS Provost Marshal Kasiha Valkanir reiterated in her statements to the Assembly the importance of survival technology for military personnel, advocating augmentation and personality backup wherever feasible. The DED's Star Marshal Kjersidur Elladall emphasized the importance of continuing to support capsuleer efforts through loyalty programs and support for accelerated training for those combating threats such as the Triglavians and Drifters.
---
The Amarr Empire and Gallente Federation have been particularly strong supporters of the proposals, with their extensive territories coming under repeated attacks by the Triglavians. Though defending more compact empires, the Caldari State and Minmatar Republic have also lent support to the measures but criticized Amarr and Gallente suggestions that all four empires share the financial burdens equally.
---
The Assembly is currently in closed session but is reported to be "thrashing out details of a formula that will spread fundraising fairly across New Eden's economies."

---
Yeah brah. Why can’t people just brawl me and my 500 drooling nulltards like real men?! What are they sissy?
---
It's the most we've ever seen people login especially using all their old accounts, alpha included for the average of &lt;10 seconds. This would not be a lie.
---
It's the least number of people ever logged in YoY for people staying on concurrently, this would never be said but eveoffline clearly states it as a fact.
---
You just have to figure out which of these statements is okay for everyone not to panic especially if you belong to a publicly traded Korean company.
---
Now, which statement would you use publicly that might impact share price of your parent company?
---
Hi there!
---
Lol oh no a [cloakless] Helios on scan better MJD our to safety.....and fun was had by all....
---
????????
---
Lol you have zero idea how WHs work.
---
You are troll. We knows it now
---
By 'destroying' a Janitor, he is saying that it should be equivalent of 'killing' an NPC ^((It's a joke))
---
I just had more shakes in my hands, then in any pvp fight ... even if it's EVEOnion ... directly searched reddit for any news i might have missed ...
---
They really tricked me this time .... :O
---
You suck
---
F
---
Yeah brah. Delete wormholes I say. I would only have panfam and goons be the only entities in game. Like the true Eve. It would be so fun ya know.
---
copy/pasted the news article in full for you.
---
Which is why you're here, on reddit, spouting dumb shit, because your salary is SOOOOOO good.
---
That's correct, although there are changes coming to the RAF system which mean your friend would get 15 days Omega instead of 350 PLEX: [https://www.eveonline.com/article/pv9fkn/changes-to-the-recruitment-program-coming-soon](https://www.eveonline.com/article/pv9fkn/changes-to-the-recruitment-program-coming-soon)  
---
It says the changes will be implemented on Monday (today) although the RAF website ([https://www.eveonline.com/recruit](https://www.eveonline.com/recruit)) still shows the old rewards at time of posting.  
---
So I guess its now or never for the 350 PLEX reward
---
Probably. I ran into one and messaged him I would roll another and he still left, then messaged me back he doesn't trust me.
---
The activity is t1 friendly for newbros to make tons per hour (compared to other low skill stuff), but the gankers are either rare solo FW players, FW groups or non-FW pvpers looking for easy kills in shippos with builds 100 times what the t1 newbros can afford. Just take it with a grain of salt, find a quiet system, dock up if someone shows in d-scan and cycle alts (omega, of course).
---
FW, just a new way of mining with danger. I am expecting CCP to stop Ventures from sliding due to integrated stabs. 
---
People seem to jump to botter conclusions, so with that in mind... I would not be surprised if most are omega alts too.
---
Right... would have been too nice, too. But if you sit at the wrong end of the branch you should look where you are sawing. Otherwise this message is soon no longer a joke. Said already, who laughs last laughs best \^\^
---
Most people are but this is Reddit.

Highsec incursions will get an influx of players fighting over 1 spawn

So you have the shield skills up to level 4? If not, don't fly the snake. It's is an expensive ship to be flying it without the adequate skills.

Turns out that was a lie.

No such thing as trust in Eve, doesn't matter how small or how big the Corp

top cringe
---
&gt; No access to the news page
---
how come?
---
Lol Jesus how accurate is this honestly. The three region shuffle.
---
Honestly couldn’t tell you. I have almost no experience with low sec anything — just null and high sec. A well-fit destroyer that can speed tank and hit at range could theoretically probably kill some low sec combat sites, but I really don’t know for sure.
---
FC?
---
The argument is that this game is going into the direction of being increasingly harder to obtain resources through ingame means in this sandbox but and in the same time, getting resources it from outside the game and from npcs that magically create and sell it is becoming more and more common.
---
I know it's not an argument in your mind but "you're mad" is. 
---
Good luck finding targets in the future, mr. "hunter".

That is if you are even playing the game.

awesome?

How does someone not understand their own space? Local isn’t what makes you safe, your predictable gates, umbrellas, cynos and sheer numbers are what define null. A chat system isn’t null my friend.
---
Not sure if ill move it. Too great of a risk and i have my other drake outside, so ill find a way to utilize them there. Should be interesting :)

It does. There is a space just for that. I don't know what data YOU need. So it's blank. You can use GESI and input what works for you.

New game title: "Blackout Room" - enter a pitch black room, die over and over, and keep paying the game company.
---
&gt;Stop this weak narrative.
---
Gonna quote this back at you.
---
Let me tell you a story of how Eve was (and that's what most people that complain about caps want to return to). Eve was great when people didn't care about ratters. Why did people attack ratters (pre-mega empire)? They did so to provoke a fight. They didn't care about killing the ratter, they wanted to fight the around 30 people defense subcap fleet that formed against their 5 people gang because they actually had a chance to fight them (not win, mind you, but they can get a few kills and escape/die in a ball of fire). That defense fleet also didn't care about the ratters, they're there to fight off the 5 man gang. Small gangs were content generators for big empires that figured that they would keep growing because they keep giving their line members content. And why use subcaps? Because caps+ were expensive and rare, you wouldn't want to use them willy-nilly because if that 5 man gang escalates, they'd be in trouble.
---
Now, empire builders figured out that they don't need to keep their line members happy to grow, they need to keep them mining and ratting to out-build every other entity. CCP went along with this because they figured that the giant expensive 200k$ battles that keep them in the news cycle is what brings along new players and makes Eve popular. This meant that those empires can now create the famous umbrella that protects their ratters and miners, which makes them grow even bigger.
---
So now, when small-gang drop on a ratter, expecting a cool response fleet and fight, they instead get a single super that they cannot do anything against. That super can web and scram you, while dealing an ungodly amount of DPS. This basically led us to the current whaling meta, where the only PvP you could ever get in Delve as a small-ganger is through whaling. And whaling fucking sucks, but it's the only interaction you can ever have in Delve as a neutral. (Note: I'm hammin on Delve, but this basically applies to any super umbrella in the game).
---
This also leads to an expectation of safety and essentially anti-social solo play in null line members. Go to any other space in Eve Online and kill a ratter. That ratter is reshipping and calling his buddies to come and fight you. And this creates good fights for everybody. Only in null will you see the line member dock up, wait until the threat leaves and then resume krabbing once the threat is gone.
---
This is the Eve that people want to go back to when they talk about nerfing supers, because it promotes anti-social play in null. If (for example) all cap+ application on subcaps was nerfed so that you'd have to send a subcap fleet to response to a small gang fleet, it would force null empires to go back to the old style, where cap+ are used for empire v empire warfare and not for home defense.

At that range to logi would be in fall-off and would have issues holding reps on the hic if it got primarried. The choice to sit at 0 on the machs is odd, but if they were gonna focus to Loki fleet anyway it's not a bad choice especially if it saved a sabre from a smartbomb or two
---
Hmmm I get the feeling this will be the change to bounties that people have been talking about. More people ratting in one area reduces payment. Since each empire has to pay the bounties it can be something like a pool of money and as it runs "low" the payments drop. Same deal with minerals. Might allow for some more resource warfare like mentioned in that recent interview.

Just out of curiosity went out and checked last 20 pages (\~4 days) of our KB for any capitals dropped in frigs this past few days. While there are a few smartbombing BS kills, or certainly unfair ganks of passers by by cruiser gangs, I found zero frig kills by caps in Black Rise in the last few days... Plenty fleet action though, mainly us driving off US TZ Goons attempts at bashing WANGS structures. 
---
Not saying the rest of the points aren't accurate. The region is probably dead quiet apart from occasional gate camps or fleet actions. And we most likely are responsible for that. Not like I took part in any local "driving off content" actions, but one cannot deny that the prospect of getting dropped and out-eascalated would be enough for a lot of people not to commit to any proper fights in the area.

It's not increasingly harder for normal players to "get resources", only for AFK krab clowns. And we don't care for AFK krab clowns, they are the bane of the economy and game in a myriad of ways.

Enjoy your next game. Make sure it doesn't require too much brain effort, you seem to struggle with that.

---
Once again, I think that Falcon and Hilmar paint EVE players with too broad a brush. Not everyone in nullsec has an ISK-printing machine and making null into a 'hellscape' as Falcon calls it is a bit too far in the other direction from his current characterization of null (which I also think is overgeneralized) being totally safe. 
---
I'll qualify my remarks with the admission that I only recently returned to the game after a three-year hiatus and I have never been a space billionaire with multiple  accounts. Hell, I can barely keep hold of my one character let alone run cyno alts, cloaky alts, Indy alts, etc. 
---
I also understand that addressing the botting issue is important; I hate the notion of bots and I know they are real and can really screw the EVE economy. I just feel like these measures are punitive and that I don't fit the mold of the behavior they're trying to regulate. I guess it is possible that there are more players like the ones they describe with such derision than there are like me, so I'm no rage-quitter just because blackout in null. 
---
I don't like the idea of things changing weekly, either. I've never been an EVE savant and despite playing just a couple of years less than Falcon, his knowledge far surpasses mine. Being risk-averse is not a character flaw even in a game like EVE and it shouldn't mean I have to write off certain experiences in the game because of that.

Don't you pathetic idiot try to claim you care about any way of getting resources from the sandbox, you clearly do not care.
---
You only care of some gameplay you want and not about anybody elses.
---
But in your outrageous stupidity and simplicity you utterly fail to realize that the game's ecosystem is very complex and turning the tide just like that will make it crumble to a state where your gameplay will be a lot harder to reazile as it was before. For someone like you, impossible.

Oh I know. But I learned long ago to stop trusting people with an agenda on their numbers.
---
Are Eve global numbers down since the blackout ? Definitely yes.
---
Is the number of active player up ? CCP says so, we cannot prove otherwise. But you cannot tell me that the 20 or so bittervet that logged back to Eve is enough to surpass the number of bots that logged off waiting for a fix, can you ? Not even counting krabs/indus people that stay offline waiting for local to come back.
---
How are they even counting the number of active people ? Number of logins ? lol summer of skill. Number of people login and doing at least something in client ? lol summer of skill SP on npc. 
---
And please don't tell me CCP removed bots from their active count, because it would mean they know who is botting and didn't do anything.
---
Crap. Gotta go fast then XD. But hey 15 days omega wouldn't be too bad hmmm

---
You have the wrong idea if what nullsec life is.
---
I really hope it was just a minmatar one...
---
Why wouldn't they be able to bomb on gate?
---
Well obviously this is the underlying objective. Its painted in a manner that each person can interpret in their own way but at the end of the day, I think we all seem to forget that CCP is a company and companies exist to make money. As much money as they can actually. Their main concern is profit. They don't care how much money you have in your pocket or if you can or can't afford to pay, they care about getting that money in their accounts. If this bothers anyone, well that's too fucking bad, your entire life is going to be this way till you die, so get used to it.
---
If you can't handle paying real money to play the game then maybe it's not for you. What good does it do for CCP bottom line if are able to pay subscription fees by farming in-game currency a few hours twice a month? It does NOTHING for them of course they will work towards carefully squeezing this out. This is not some silly conspiracy it's a company operating with its most important reason for existence in mind, it's bottom line.
---
I've paid with real money since this game came to fruition back in 2003, in 2005 I started making more toons. Back then you could log unless you paid your dues, there was none of this plex shit or SP for money. 
---
This silly soft generation of snowflakes doesn't seem to realize life is not free, you have to pay someone for it.

Ah, I see... I only just rejoined the game after quitting in 2014 and didn't know remote shieldreppers got optimal and falloff nowadays. Makes more sense now; thanks!

Because they're run by people who don't want to fight unless they have to. One of the reasons I'm so stoked about the Eve changes is that they are likely going to force large wars over resources and territory. At least let's hope so, for the sake of content.

Am I the only one turned off of Project Discovery because of the tutorial?

I was going through it last night, and after the first few concept examples it had me go through some on my own. So I did, and obviously failed on the first one. I was told it was wrong, given a hint, and no opportunity to show that I understood the hint and what I did wrong, and to correct myself and show the two of us I understand what's going on. Instead I was just basically told "well that's wrong, . . . next example!"
---
Is there a way to go back and redo those first few curated examples that I'm missing, or is that just the way it is?
---
I understand not doing it later, but this is the damn tutorial where you make sure your players/subjects know what they're doing, that seems wrong.

Yulai, Genesis – Substantially increased tax and broker fees are to be levied on interstellar market transactions by the Secure Commerce Commission, following today's passage in the CONCORD Assembly of the "New Eden Defense Fund Act YC121" (NEDFA). SCC markets will see base transaction tax increase from 2.00% to 5.00%, while the base brokerage fee will rise from 3.00% to 5.00%.

*Above: SCC poster promoting New Eden Defense Fund Act*
---
While the core empires supported the New Eden Defense Fund Act's goals, they were keen to arrive at a means of raising the funds that would spread the load across the New Eden economy and focused on interstellar trade taxes as a means to achieve this. Welcoming the passage of the NEDFA legislation, the DED's Star Marshal Kjersidur Elladall was again keen to emphasize that funding for capsuleer loyalty programs and improved training will be maintained due to the contributions to New Eden's defense of capsuleer fighters.
---
Capsuleer efforts in the struggle against the Triglavians have been acknowledged with preferential tax and brokerage levels made possible through skilled accounting and the continuing benefit of collecting broker fees when operating Upwell structures. Improvements to the SCC tax code will allow efficient accounting and brokerage negotiations to gain improved savings relative to the increased base tax and fess. However, minimum tax and brokerage fees will still be above levels currently achievable through skilled accountancy and good relations with market operators.
---
Capsuleer news services have been extensively reporting on the Triglavian invasion and other emergent threats, and the ARC Studios-broadcast show *The Discourse* has [reported on the New Eden Defense Fund Act](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEHvLDj6Sg4) and consequent tax measures.
---
The Scope understands that the SCC will run market stability simulations imminently and plans to implement the new tax and brokerage fee regime within days.

Is definitely worth joning man pick a side and do some solo/gang stuff if you chose the min/amarr wz it can be quite during the earlier hours but tends to pick up in the evening. I do recommend joning a corp thought. we are always recruting but god forbid you make the wrong decision and join amarr they have some alright dudes and all but boo amarr and all that :)
---
First impression: This is a gift to Perimeter and the other Upwell trade hubs.
---
You can always get a few null systems that aren't too far and build there. Also there's a good amount of titans already in lowsec through asset safety or people moving them from the big nullblocks being traded. They are a bit more expensive then buying directly from manufacturer but it's possible.
---

Null sec groups are not moving to LS and they are not dropping titans in low-sec. Don't try and make it part of the black-out drama.
---
SP for killing trig invaders? Would be interesting.
---
You could join a smaller group that's more pvp focused and less of a pyramid scheme. If you actually want to get into pvp, join a (likely smaller) corp with a strong small gang culture and flatter leadership. If you really want to join a big null bloc, Dreddit is recruiting. We're weird in that our small gang guys really feel like we're like a 100 man corp hiding inside a 1000 man corp inside a giant alliance. It's like russian nesting dolls but with more kikis.
---
I like the idea quite a bit.
---
It's not quite what you've envisioned, but for now there is the note pad in game... Mines successfully saved random notes for more than a decade. As long as you're careful about keeping your ships straight, a person could keep up a ships log there
---
huge buff to the hisec cartel
---
glad to see that someone who hasnt logged in for 3 years and has never killed a super or titan has got opinions on anti capital gameplay!
---
Seems about right. Why build all those dreads if you don't use em?
---
Which is really funny to see tbh.
---
Definitely horde aswell, all three are part of the TTT consortium and have a reason to keep it running without competition
---
Technically the dreads moved very *fast* when they jumped in.
---
Capitals are just big EHP sponges, this is about as exiting as it gets (which is why you need a decent number of pilots to begin with).
---
There is nothing you can do to make killing capitals more interesting without breaking them
---
Thanks bud. You as well.
---
So, who is that Falcon anyway?
---
\&gt;CCP Hilmar: "The richest 1% have way too much, it's even worse than real life."  
---
\&gt;Developers: "Let's make trading in NPC stations more expensive so everyone trades in the Keepstar controlled by the richest 1%"
---
This is some 200IQ play
---
He has every right to post opinions on anti capital gameplay.
---
That being said, I never killed a super or titan in more than 10 years and I agree with you that an anti-titan subcap will not change anything about it.
---
i've done good today it seems

Oh I love the gatekeeping

And sometimes it would delete your boot.ini.

you can undock, then offline them however
---
I'm really confused, is this going to be in the game? The last time we had some ingame roleplaying announcement was when they said blackout was going to be permanent, and then we were told that it wasn't an official CCP release so it wasn't true.  
---
Can someone clarify what the fuck we're suppose to believe and what we're not?

\*Laughts in TTT\*

I handle my tax evasion the same I do in RL: I let other people do it who have the skills trained.
---
Yes however as explained above, I was unable to interact with the fitted modules :)

idk, back before we had the fighter rework and HAW we didn't see  fights with just capitals on field
---
AHAHBAHAHAH OK.
---
F... 5%! And there goes the margin.
---
yes im sure im the one looking bad, someone who hasnt logged in for 3 years giving balance opinions is literally the reason that shitty balance changes happen
---
why tho
---
hunting is separate to the actual fighting, keeping trying though this is entertaining
---
yeah and you do neither hunting nor fighting :)
---
I have nothing against CCP wanting to make lots of money, I would have nothing against making it completely pay to play so no more plex.
---
I do have a lot against that pay to win model of games, they are all garbage and EVE was not this kind of game in the past and isn't yet but it's heading thay way.
---
Yes you could buy plex and sell it but it was all in a tolerable dose and the game had meaningfull way to obtain resources and isk from the sandbox itself.
---
If they nerf the sandbox to oblivion, the only thing left will be a garbage pay to win model that keeps players addicted and paying with gambling-like and other shitty mechanics.
---
What defense? LOL
---
&gt;You can always get a few null systems that aren't too far and build there.
---
When is the last time this happened without the group taking sov not already owning some titans?
---
About the ability to use titans and supers in lowsec: The results would be exactly the same if the null entities would limit themselves to carriers and dreadnaughts, they just happen to have the bigger playerbase and endless respawning anomalies.
---
* First second impression. "The did WHAT!? RIP marging trading"
---
* Literally any braincells working after that. *How about see how this goes and how it affects your gameplay. Maybe marging will get bigger sue to larger ISK overhead of taxes?
---
oh dear, was really expecting a better response. Not the first time I've overestimated you I guess though.
---
While I can wholeheartedly endorse Horde for getting back into PvP as a returning player. I can also say that you should give some wormhole groups a go if you’re into purely PvP. There are a few different groups which have nullsec static’s, there are also a few groups which live in high class space and are worth a try. The life style IS different, but can be very fun and rewarding especially to get into PvP.
---
T E X A S L A W
---
when was the last time you overestimated me??
---
Critical thinking skills are lost on today's youth.
---
For me to know and you to wonder forever
---
lmao thought so, v cringe
---
I was expecting an NPC bounty cut, but looks like they're rather widen the ISK sink than narrow the faucet.
---
I have the skills trained, send me all your stuff.
---
&gt;  It deserved to be exploited and was.
---
True ... but still does not make BBTB or Goons white knights
---
Why would nullsec guys be moving to lowsec with their titans and supers because of the blackout? It doesn't make any sense.
---
=s imagine thinking im the cringe one here yikes
---
These lore events are CCPs way of announcing in game changes a lot of times.
---
Blackout got both an in game announcement and an out of game (out of character announcement) to ensure everyone understood it.
---
This tax increase will go into effect almost certainly.
---
i got bad news... a lot of ppl are laughing at u :\ whose laughing at me with u??
---
I opened reddit when I got to work and this is the first post on the front page, almost gave me a heart attack
---
&gt; Have you ever noticed your turds in the toilet resemble asteroid belts? (i.redd.it)
---
Don't fucking do this to me first thing on Monday morning.
---
ok now you've just regressed to 12 years  old I think were done here
---
here, have a nickel, just stay away from the goddamn door
---
I don't look around much during hotdrops.
---
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
ok let me know when u get some friends in the game or you decide to play the game that you suggest balance changes for :) good chat!
---
Uh that deal is over right?
---
They never said it was permanent.
---
Just imagine if CCP said "FUCK IT" and now HS is the new null sec for a undetermined amount of time...
---
That shit would be TRUE CHAOS!!!
---
SKULLS FOR THE SKULL TRHONE!!!
---
BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD!!!
---
No, being serious here... Am I the only person that would actually laugh maniacally and actually get my barge out with a pvp fit? xD
---
This
---
Ah, morning time to check reddit real quick. HOLY SHIT WHAT
---
Oh...
---
Thanks for strangest morning strange, panicked excitement
---
It's called search. Use that, it will give you the links to the MERs you fucking moron.
---
ya i get you i guess i just dont get it when people who havent played in years give opinions on balance, if you dont play the game and get all your info from reddit how do you really know how stuff works? ive always been of the mind that ppl should really think about balance changes so we dont get shitty changes.
---
They are not blue to FRT, just like you to Goons ... it's stupid to throw stones in a glass house ...
---
Actually if they removed PANIC and also got rid of excavs, a rorq would be about as easy to kill as a carrier or pretty close to it but won't be so hideously expensive that it will not be flown.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
but the question is: will CCP get the axe by Cable and the entirety of EVE™ now?
---
&gt; then they will always have out
---
T2 mining drones. Because miners are all about efficiency.
---
WHs are the best krab space in the game. It is not a place of awesome PVP no matter what you tell yourself.
---
Anything fit with a mwd will kill me though.
---
Keep yourself safe
---
You need to eat more fiber.
---
That already happens.
---
Look up sales tax mechanics.
---
It's like every tutorial in eve to be honest - it doesn't explain anything. I've got the hang of it after watching some YouTube tutorials. Lots of the samples are no pattern, which doesn't give you negative nor positive standing but gives you isk for that. I think at first you get easier samples so it's easy to differentiate between no pattern and a planet pattern. Planet patterns are the ones where you actually see a big V or W "spike". Some of the samples have just 1 "spike" but some have the spikes repeating itself throughout the whole sample. What I did to increase my accuracy to 95% was to just keep opening and closing the project until I get a clear cut V spike that you cannot mistake. If anything comes up that's fairly hard to recognize, I just close the window and reopen it, that way you get a new sample without the chance of getting the last one wrong.
---
Does this mean Volta are gonna declare war on concord now?
---
Can’t wait for the jump in cost of shit on the market 👍🏻
---
Interesting if the remove asset safety all those high sec loot piñata's just waiting to be cracked open.
---
But still zero times anybody overestimated you ... the first post reveals what you will sperg next
---
sad as fuck that horde accepted the tapirium bribe to leave them alone
---
They sure are.
---
Got to update that flair. 😀
---
They are mimicking real life governments... #EvEisReaL!
---
Ok i will use argumetn same level.
---
JAJAJA
---
snuff shoting blues, whats new. when ppl will learn to not blue them? lol
---
Because the Nulls are working together to burn highsec and lowsec because of the blackout. You can downvote me all day long but the truth is the truth.

can't tell what this is intended to target...
---
i don't think this is enough to move vast amounts of goods to TTT or anything
---
also RIP the off-Jita markets.
---
Just log off... your ship will warp away safetly once cyno is done. Then just re-log conveniently
---
You mean more people will use the TTT market further making the top 1% more richer
---
Lol, ok.
---
when i first started playing the i found that larger ships were too expensive for me so instead of skilling vertically i skilled horizontally and got really good at flying frigates. recently when auditing my old assets after coming back i found an old slasher sitting in carrou and it reminded me of my first time taking main tackle in several fleets while trying to evict a larger group from that pocket. It was the most fun ive ever had in any multiplayer videogame, and that ship will stay there until the servers rot as a memorial to the excellent friends i made in this game.
---
I was pushing both skills to lv 4... I guess it will be going 5 after today's announcement! :(
---
Cuts down on ISK inflation, other than that I guess they're curious to see what happens - and they can always go back to how it was before.
---
man they should fucking hire you
---
Bravo.
---
A change of diet perhaps?  You may also have some kind of intestinal issue, such as IBS.
---
Read comment of falcon : NOT PERMANENT.
---
If I'm not mistaken... It was a lore related event where the Amarr empire(DICKIS) proceeded to genocide one of the tribes to oblivion... Something about they refusing to be slaved! &gt;.&gt;

&gt;Finanar III miners strike over increased salt quota
---
glorious.
---
??? Well done, you proved what I was saying.
---
Isn't snuff always dropping titans on people in low? (completely unrelated to blackout though)
---
&gt;When is the last time this happened without the group taking sov not already owning some titans?
---
Like last week in scalding pass. Pretty sure Ygg (former lowsec like 20 man corp) doesn't have any titans.
---
Well they did want to do away with npc stations, this seems like a good first step to encourage it.
---
Not all of the fees for the market are player controlled in citadels. There are still fees that go to NPCs.

---
if by FC u mean fleet commander, then no. seeing, that im currently a solo player, it would be redundant to find a fleet commander and ask a question, that has nothing to do with them :)
---
Yeah, but that's like saying "Rancer is a dangerous system to fly a pod through", or "Poitot is the only named system in Syndicate".
---
What was, will be.
---
What we need is CCP creating incentive to trade in multiple places and not just around Jita.        
---
A tax based on the value of the market should be introduced with the conjunction of security status of system it is placed.           
---
For example.            
---
Let say that maximum taxing is 5%.            
---
But this tax is created from 4 elements.            
---
* 2% **Isk sink** (broker fee - whatever you call it) - you always need to pay it.               
---
* Up to 1% Trade Tax - dependent on the share of the market - the bigger trade hub the bigger this values gets - paid to owner of the citadel                    
---
* 2% Security Tax  - trade hub in 1.0 have 2% but one in 0.5sec gets just 0.4% tax. **Lowsec and null don't get this tax!**   
---
* ??% Owner Tax - this is what owner of structure can put up.  Maybe put upper limit on it. NPC have base 1%. 
---
What is the effect:                      
---
* trading at citadel in 1.0 big trade hub cost you 5% **Before Player Tax** but the player gets 1% of the tax even if he set his tax on 0%                   
---
* minimal Tax in 0.5 sec **station**  you can find is 3.4%        
---
* minimal tax in lowsec/nullsec **station 3%          
---
* minimal Tax in a 0.5 sec **citadel** 2.4%        
---
* minimal tax in a lowsec/nullsec **citadel** 2%  ^(max 3% in big trade hub when owner don't use his own tax)            
---
More interesting, more reason for people to move around.
---
You guy never come and visit any more, do not know where you small gang has gone but its never up north any more 😫
---
read the first comment to it from CCP\_Falcon.
---
That's an in character news piece, no one has released any information saying this would be forever.
---
It's a test, we're still collecting data, and it's far too early to say if this is going to be permanent.
---
Might want to unrustle your jimmies for a while there bud.
---
USTZ usually roams to provi or delve these days, Frat's USTZ is completely fucking dead.
---
People would still use one location for convenience unless it becomes extremely cost prohibitive. Another 1 to 5 % won't do it. 10 to 30 % based on total listed volume in billions of isk might though. That or limit total amount of posted contracts per station. Like 100,000 contracts for the largest and 10,000 for the smallest.
---
This translates to less than 2% real cost difference...
---
If you do you are mining way too much.
---
Right, I was more or less saying that null groups will 100% drop on any target of opportunity... Snuff drops on anything in low sec. The hyperbole of connecting it to the blackout is lunacy.
---
Blackout cut bounties hard.
---
[electrical bill gone up again](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cf2b30/a_green_new_deal/)
---
&gt; you should move back to empire if you want to mine in safety. Lawless space should have risk. 
---
I think Falcon fundamentally misunderstands the nature of Null and High Sec currently if he thinks that you can mine in high sec safely.  High sec is far *far* ***far*** more lawless now, than null sec ever was in the past.
---
The ease with which all but the least profitable, sub capital mining ship can be dispatched by a single 2 million ISK destroyer is almost comical.  Making high sec the most dangerous place in EVE to mine except maybe the highly fought over low sec systems.
---
Don't think that's a real quote.
---
Yes, I know, I linked directly to falcon's comment in the thread titled "blackout now forever" because people saw a post, just like this one, saying blackout was going to be permanent. Falcon then said it was just a "character news piece" and not policy. Hence why there are questions about a similar announcement and the validity of it.
---
This aint it chief
---
Pretty much the same as when sales taxes increase in real life.
---
Almost nobody notices.
---
Whew, my heart stopped a beat for a sec. Was scared. Anyway, Onion right on.
---
Yes, but that is the idea.        
---
Trade hubs will be still there but people will move around trying to save isk.       
---
More moving, more hauling ... like this trit you place bought order actually was completed 10j away ... but in wrong direction that you hoped.
---
&gt; they said blackout was going to be permanent
---
Nothing every said this, in roleplay or otherwise.
---
The only logical interpretation was "indefinite" which is very different.
---
This has somewhat become my goal too. If you're only gonna plex one character, exploration doesn't require much time to make enough to plex one account but if you're playing on more than one account it's no longer as viable.
---
what a coincidence they all stopped fighting and grouped together
---
*cough* CSM *cough*
---
&gt;  "Maintained Indefinitely" 
---
INDEFINITELY is not PERMANENTLY.

Sales Tax isn't controlled by players.

I can't find Ygg or the space they have claimed in Scalding Pass

It's not a content driver? Makes it more worthwhile to fight over marketplaces, no?

I swear there were comments here before... Anwyay, just a few cap catches from our fleet yesterday :)
---
So high sec was laughing their ass off at our blackout.  Is it our turn?
---
Wow look at this dweeb enjoying the game
---
In fact they just bring back old taxe rate. They just start to remove slowly thing make under the Seaguls era.
---
Just snorted monster "ultra sunrise" out of my nose. Not even mad.
---
Player buff idea : when you play longer than 6 months - you no longer can use T1 frigates as they are ships for newbies.      
---
After 8 months you cannot use T1 destroyers as you "grew up" ...      
---
After 1.5years you can only board T2, T3, Faction ships or capitals leaving the starter ships for newbies and new players.
---
You only change the fact that titans will drop in one after another and firing their doomsdays.
---
Also you can jump a titan in the enemy titan fleet and stop all their doomsdays as well.
---
lol - Might do but Tijai is chilling somewhere in a wormhole atm
---
If they said this, they should just fucking quit and give eve to someone with a clue.
---
What is amount to be descent ?
---
just posting in the thread so I can find this BR the next time someone asks me why I think Rorquals (as a mechanic in a vacuum, not their current yield/hr) is a good thing for this game.
---
no warning, pop-up engagements where intel is a commodity you have to work for, and both sides take a fight because neither one knows for sure at the start who's coming, in what numbers, and whether or not they can win.
---
Someone tried already to eject it in space and then shoot the can?
---
Broker fees
---
I'll wager the faucet moved, rather than go reduced.
---
Load up the credit card with plex, nice 15% sale on atm, and sell for ISK... takes seconds and will give you dank ticks
---
And here people were complaining about a couple of tenths at TTT.
---
yeah.. like who would attack the keepstar right?
---
that's what the AOE cap drain was supposed to do.
---
Don't remove asset safety.
---
I think it really depends on how they implement it. They could make it as granular as by each system, constellation, region, or by rat faction. It could even be a combination of them with each having a weight. So something like the system can handle X amount paid out before dropping, and the constellation can handle Y(greater than X) before dropping. So if people rat in one system, then the system's payouts are less. If they focus on a single constellation then every system in that constellation gets lower payouts. I think the goal should be to push to spread out in their space but not destroy ratting completely.
---
But it stacks up for more advanced products pretty fast.       
---
2% **on each** item along the way required for a production of T2 ship is pretty big.      
---
Reaction , Pi ... all the stuff that enters the market when it was processed 1 step higher.
---
seeing "eve onion" made me so sad
---
Ugh I can't remember what their fucking alliance name is, but it's a one corp alliance that just took a couple of the backwater systems up in the northeast.
---
More money will now go though player citidels, so will volta double down on stopping that? Will test still see the value in paying horde and goons to not shoot the keepstar but protect it?
---
I assume it is a percent cut that horde gets, i can see test and goons not seeing the value in paying us.
---
That's better than current mechanics and how do you coordinate 30+ titans jumping in and Dding in order?
---
It has been a long time since I've heard an idea this shit.
---
By long, I mean 18 hours since that other idiot posted his anti-cloaking thread
---
Yeah I’m sure light cyno, drop big E peens and F1 is the pinnacle of great PvP for the faceless line member.
---
So all the old bittervets will fly T2,T3, faction or capitals only... wait they already do.
---
Come on StainGuy, you can do better (worse)
---
It started off as just another day.  Moving thousands of tons of materials from a trade hub in Empire space to the manufacturing facility that I had setup in Null-sec.   I was unconcerned as my convoy of jump freighters made the transition under my watchful eye,  my agents were well trained and I had the local pirate crew on retainer.      I checked each ship off the list as it blinked away from existence in the local grid area and arrived 12 light years away, eager to drop off their load for the waiting manufacturing crews to take on and continue construction of several thousand smaller types of ships to deliver to a client for their own private war.  
---
Only two more runs and we would be done for the day.   Then it would be a slew of other things to tend to, supply contracts,  resource shortages.. it never ends.  I sighed internally before cloaking up my trusty recon cruiser that I used to personally oversee the low sec transition point.    As I waited for the jump freighters to signal they were unloaded and refueled for a return trip, I checked my messages and was surprised to find a letter waiting for me from someone. It stood out as it did not come encoded with the code that my clients use to indicate business, and thus it was not sorted into the massive pile of requests that seemed to be the bane of my existence.    
---
Opening the letter I was shocked,  a capsuleer privateer that had just recently graduated from the academy  had purchased one of my old destroyers.  A Thrasher class Minmatar destroyer that had a knack of raining down firey projectile death on frigates. and also for one of the wingy bits falling off everytime it made a hard left turn...  By and large it was nothing special but for this particular capsuleer, it was his first destroyer and he had chanced upon my old one in a regional market auction and got it for a good price,  he discovered that it contained my early logs which had not been erased or corrupted (A minor miracle considering the stability of the Thrasher's computer system).  The capsuleer described the hours he had spent reading my logs and how such a now well known and respected member of the capsuleer community had the same humble beginnings as him and experienced many of the same challenges.  He mentioned in particular a log that highlighted a fight with a Angel Cartel cruiser squadron where my thrasher narrowly avoided destruction by overloading the afterburner while at the same time offlining one of the guns in order to use its thermal exhaust channels to vent the excess heat.     The letter went on similarly and concluded with the promise to take equal or greater care of the ship that I had and to begin recording logs for the next captain of the ship. 
---
I smiled,  the worries of a small industrial empire momentarily forgotten.  I had long since given up the practice of hunting and combat in favor of creating the powerful tools that empires used to ply their trade in war and peace.  On most days it was very rewarding and insanely profitable but it did leave little time for some of the pursuits that I found so enjoyable after leaving the academy and trying to get my start as a capsuleer.   But somehow fate had conspired to place my old ship in the hands of someone who was appreciative and found my earlier struggles informative and would learn from those experiences.   I decided then to find time to further myself in those areas and hopefully my experiences would help more capsuleers.     I made a note in the manufacturing queue to build 50 more Thrashers for surprise delivery to the capsuleer that had sent me the letter, their costs easily written off as a rounding error for one of the capital manufacturing accounts and smiling as I recalled the particular Thrasher that the capsuleer had purchased had been the last in about a dozen such ships that I had flown which all met and untimely end before getting the hang of destroyer command,  a few extra spares never hurt...    I chuckled as I pictured how that capsuleer might react and then began preparations for the return of the jump freighters.  The business still had to run and I was till its head,  but as I started the sequence to open up a cyno beacon for the frighters I also began checking the nearby mission hubs for capsuleer contracts and noting one that I could do in a Thrasher, once the days business was over, he would have some fun.
---
horde/panfam is nothing but a pet at this point, they are irrelevant
---
They had us in the first half.
---
Trading is how I supply all my accounts. The opportunities to look for are ones where you can make isk in the background. Low attention things. Even if they only pay out a small bit of isk, it adds up the more you have just like in RL. And because it’s passive it leaves you open to make more actively if you choose.
---
It is? 
---
Because there’s not really another way to quickly break through fax reps. Even with the stacking penalties, DD volleys are the only way to ensure Titan brawls see lots of ships dying, rather than two balls of Titans tanking everything that comes at them. 
---
This basically would make a Titan blob invincible to anything but an absolutely massive dreadbomb, which would definitely cost more than it would be able to destroy.
---
Yes, but the point is that there is still a npc controlled isk sink.
---
This is a buff to verticle integration if I ever saw it.
---
Just bring back the default warp to gate distance at 15km but instead of letting people creating bookmarks to bypass them, make it an invisible bubble effect that can not be nullified by any means. Suddenly your 15-jump trip to jita feels much more painful now.
---
Not only is the PANIC worthless outside a belt but the rorqual is also not a common large fleet fight ship.
---
Making profit is only half the picture. You need to enjoy doing it as well. Find what you love and profit at it.  Personally, I'm done doing the hard work. I sold some characters, made 50 billion, now all I do is PvP. Well I have PI alts that give me about 25mil a day, so that helps.
---
Quite the opposite I would think. Prices will likely rise in response to increased taxes, which makes the purchasing power of 1 Isk less. In other words, this is an inflationary pressure.
---
Wormholes are by far the easiest and safest way to make isk outside of hisec right now, assuming you can fly a half decent rapid heavy missile praxis. You will need to join an actual wormhole Corp, though, you can’t just do this solo.
---
if they make it funny, attack should ve lead drifters or triglavians :-D
---
Game-wide SP levels do not update while a skill is training, you have to pause and restart the skill to propagate partial SP levels to other parts of the game.
---
This is the only way to actually remove money from the economy.
---
It's frequently at the center of fleet fights, albeit not as an intentional part of either side's doctrine. (Unrelated, but heavy tackle Rorqs are still fantastic.)
---
tfw kicked out of novice plexes warfare because of Stainguy.
---
That were changed even though they were promised not to. It's a shame that Horde and TEST aren't at each other's necks over that.
---
Are you stupid or retarded
---
what would be amazing is CCP Falcon creating a RL investment corporation and buying CCP backed by a huge crowfunding effort from the community :)
---
If you can find a group which can fight the combined forces of TEST + Imperium + PANFAM then yeah sure it's a content driver. But whilst these groups have an agreement to split the TTT Keepstar profits citadel market pvp is dead.
---
When they revert nullsec and the vni back to normal i come back
---
Oh right, yeah, it's done. But you could still get it even if you paid yearly
---
But they clearly state it is because of the panic that they are used in the massive fleet fights.
---
There aren't any null corps leaving for low sec. That just not happening. In fact, many low sec corps are terrorizing null space due to the blackout.
---
op showing how little he knows of the game.
---
TFW your video games have tax hikes 
---
What a time to be alive
---
Market trading requires using 3rd party tools including spreadsheets to properly keep track of your costs and profits. It takes a lot of time, and honestly if you do it in high sec it requires you but a market bot or you'll never sell anything. 
---
The best way to make quick money in eve is use a credit card and then just PVP all the time.
---
Unless these massive fleet fights are player vs anomalies
---
Sorry no. I have no desire to login right now. I rather play xcom 2 or watch a lp from christoper odd on youtube.
---
Both, but I still don’t see what you have against a doomsday volley.
---
they are, just not in the way you're thinking
---
This is from an older iteration of the game. The original battle roqual had a little bit of tank and a ton of heavy points and webs. It would warp to a book mark set up in advance get tackle on a bunch of things then panic while giving shield boosts.
---
Awesome!
---
I am wanting a text list I can open and use as a shopping list, just deleting the ones I already have.
---
&gt;they said blackout was going to be permanent
---
No, they said indefinite.
---
&gt; how do you coordinate 30+ titans jumping in and Dding in order?
---
List of all the titan pilots. Someone just calls them out in the order of the list to jump in after the previous DD is done.
---
Definitely, I haven’t been as involved since that rollout and didn’t realize some of the infrastructure seems to exist.
---
My preferred yet terrible comms is discord, so no eve logging required.
---
Makes sense: A bounty cut would only hurt missioneers, while a sales tax hurts everyone who isn't 100% self-sufficient. And the number of completly self-sufficient people isn't very high
---
The radial menu is shit, and he doesn't disable it, so REEEE harder Mr. /r/eve warrior.
---
Karma on.
---
So essentially you agree that you've made nullsec safer than highsec.
---
Thanks for making my point
---
Is doom managing that facebook page?
---
I totally get that but PANIC has been asteroid belt specific for what 2 years?  They make for good heavy tackle but not much else that other ships cant do and are certainly not a main fleet ship for capital fleets
---
*holds up spork*
---
NPC gets ISK ... nobody wins ... the perimeter owners gets ISK ... they win ...
---
Whatever it is ... you lose.
---
Maybe start with trying to remember which region, Scalding Pass is not North East.
---
Only small alliance I see are Literally Triggered, who do not own the IHUBs and technically have a super
---
Space Aids killed many wonderful people, along with Fozzie Sov.
---
Both isk and mineral faucets will be reduced. You are probably thinking that the reduction will be more severe in random nullsec compared to umbrella regions like Delve, which might be the case.
---
Today all the people who laughed about NullSec-Carebear-Tears because of the Black-Out learned that karma is a bitch.
---
I called it.
---
Semantics at this point. It wasn't a real CCP announcement, that's what I'm getting at.
---
Definitely alot to be said about sentiment of specific ships. I'm curious, did killmarks show up on it with the update since you flew it?
---
There is more than one way to do it. In general I'd say if you're solo or in a really small group dual prop fits provide the most survivability. However if you are supporting a fleet (or more specifically playing as a type of anti-support) then I like using a MWD fit with MSE and medium ASB, that way I know I have more survival time so my fleet members can respond. I dont put gyros in the lows, I use a nano, overdrive, and a DCU. Your DPS is still enough for soft targets like interceptors, which every idiot in the game still believe in flying with zero tank because "speed is my tank" even though that hasnt been true since like 2012. 150 dps isnt a lot for ganking PVE cruisers and 100mn fit VNI will be annoying due to your short range but that's not where the ship shines.

Overheating to like 10km/s and running down that cocky moron sitting at 100km in some sniper bullshit is where it shines. Decloaking that asshole bomber that is harassing your gang as you move gate to gate is. Locking down out of place enemy support ships as an enemy gang tries to extract, is. Shredding bad interceptor pilots, of which 4 have been nerfed through removal of their bubble immunity so you get to thrash the even weaker ones more often, 100% is.
---
The game has a lot of anti-frigate capable ships and modules in it now. The dramiel used to be overpowered as hell but now it's just good at it's specific roles. If you go outside of those roles, which can be fun, you lose some advantage built into the ship but maybe gain some advantage in the element of surprise. 
---
Go try stuff.
---
Yes surprise, words mean things.
---
so that literally zero titans or dreads die in the big battles? lol
---
Honestly just don't worry about the other two characters right now. Focus on your main character and learn how to explore. When you start to get a better feel for how the game works then worry about the other characters.
---
If the SP farm is going to be significant it's going to be botted to all hell and back.
---
Yeah its weird the date ascribed to the original post makes no sense but that text blurb was what I remember as the reason for the change in the announcement of that batch of changes.. That was why they changed panic to only work if you had a rock locked on to. Granted it did get the roqual out of the POS and on a grid where it could be destroyed.
---
Thinking about this now that I'm sober, I'm reminded of the VoiceAttack software I setup for my Elite Dangerous VR setup. Might want to set a profile up for EVE with a "Captains Log" setup :D

What's saying the floor on citadel trading costs can't also be raised.
---
No idea honestly, I just got the 3 month one myself
---
Why not just uninstall EVE? If you don’t like multiple accounts, almost every MMO isn’t for you.
---
If you needed any proof that they don’t play the game look no further than this garbage.
---
Eh, I don't think this will do that much to be honest. Sure, Jita and the largest trade hubs are pretty low-margin and will be hit with higher prices, but for example in Solitude the prices are determined by the monopolist on an item: Many things go for double or triple their Jita value. A small shield extender is roughly 9.4k in Jita, but they sell for nearly 50k in Gravity Well. At that point the slight increase in taxes will not have an significant effect on the seller.

Rorqual tackled -&gt; PANIC -&gt; Cyno -&gt; Umbrella -&gt; Many people in system.
---
Marketing: Many people in system -&gt; massive fleet fight.

Technically the massive fleets are in system because of the PANIC module and since Rorquals are so common, so are these "fights"
---
They were and thats my fault

How the fuck is a reduction in money supply inflationary?

Honestly highsec market hub citadels should just be removed. It goes completely against the `no afk passive moon income &gt;:(` and only benefits the already big, established mega blocs. It's not like highsec can even support major fleet battles.
---
I can see that argument, but they're claiming it's "one of the more common ships" in fleet fights, but if there is only 1 rorqual and 200 stealth bombers, how is the rorqual "common" at that point?
---
And that's how you get people to never pay ransom again... morons like you are what almost killed that playstyle.
---
they've added a conflict driver to highsec. 200iq play for sure.
---
The whole reason they made an agreement was because everyone was getting burned out from having to show up to timers and fighting in horrible tidi.
---
Seems like a pretty big weakness to me
---
oh you don't like conflict drivers?
---
Or "we don't know how long it will last, or if it will be permanent, and we want to see what effect it has."
---
You know, like normal fucking people.
---
Ok Sovietswarm people can buy their own ships you know.
---
The problem is that the reduction in money supply is accomplished by an increase in sales tax. Sales tax increases are basically always inflationary, as they literally increase the price of goods. So the move is both a deflationary (decrease in money supply) and an inflationary (increase in price) one. In the short term, this is almost certainly an inflationary measure. In the long term, it will probably depend on how the two forces balance out. The only predictions I'd feel comfortable making would be short term inflation, and long term decline of NPC markets.
---
I think the combined autism of Test and Goons is something that New Eden isn't likely to see again and because of that they can outlast any other group in mindless structure bashes and saves.
---
I have been free of Eve for a while now many years. Once the Korean's fire Hilimar, Fozzie, and pull the dev of Eve to a new team I will have hope again Eve will survive and grow again. The Koreans cant be happy with the decline of game and lack of growth after paying 435 mil for it.
---
It's a better late than never thing.
---
Admittedly everyone with half a brain knew something should have been done about isk faucets and sinks years ago... So maybe we'll call it a "less horrible than it could be"?
---
I think the amount of Rorquals and stealth bombers in space is roughly equal at this point, the only difference is destribution
---
1mil sp for referrals when?

Pro-tip dumbass, you have to sell your shit too. LOL!! OMFG!!!! LMAO!!!!!!!!!!!!

Do these affect citadel transactions?

Yeah those don't last long in high intensity/high frequency brawls. Unless literally everyone joining us already filthy rich, the poorer members will have to start dropping out sooner or later or resort to buying Plex to keep their hangers stockers.
---
This is how you fix it. It has happened to me once before.
---
Repackage JF and move on with your life.
---
This does not affect the players that have too much isk the problem with them is that they could not possibly lose enough isk to make it matter. This is a direct nerf to casual players that don’t have hundreds of accounts doing logistics and industry. We need a change that forces big time players to bleed without the adverse affect to the new player.
---
It is the common source for fleet fights but not brought to fleet fights lol
---
Real world sale taxes don't destroy money, the government gets it and uses it, so they're quite a different beast.
---
How about going to look at all the accounts in JITA that sit in station for decades and other hubs running macro bots and remove them from the game every day for a few years? Do something to fix the game.
---
How about a fuel cost increase based on number of owned stud tires.
---
Doing the entire line of production for T2/T3 is a very hefty task. 
---
A lot of people buy from market to source, and on that stuff T2/T3 ships will jump a bit because of the big amount of stuff people have to source from market.
---
Do you feed all your pets line members' excavators?
---
That this probably the shittest idea ive ever heard.
---
This same error happened to me when undocking from j4m4 with 3x ore expanders and 384k m3 of stuff worth 40 bil. I couldn't dock, warp, or jump out due to being overloaded.
---
I could manually re-online one expander at a time.  I undocked an alt in a guardian, transferred capacitor, and manually onlined all three so I could dock.
---
Repackage of the ship fixes the issues and it has been 2.5 years without a reoccurrance on any of my JFs.

The megablocs have a NIP for highsec to share the profits.....  No one is gonna break that.

&gt;  Do these affect citadel transactions?

Pretty sure the broker fee is set by Cit owners but tax is the same everywhere.
---
&gt; Doing the entire line of production for T2/T3 is a very hefty task.
---
You don't need to do all of it.
---
But higher transaction fees increase the potential that verticle integration will increase profits.
---
Plenty of real world companies don't vertically integrate because it's more challenging than they believe the benefits are, and many in those same industries do integrate.
---
The best way to make money in this game is to buy it.
---
The second best way is doing something you enjoy. Focusing on min-maxing the returns, if that itself isn't a goal you enjoy, is the recipe for burnout. I know it isn't exactly the advice you're looking for, but making dank isk doesn't have to be a necessary 'evil.' 
---
Essentially, everything you have listed are **the** ways people make their isk. But inside each, are dozens, if not hundreds of smaller ways that the very successful isk makers have figured out. Each are better or worse than the others depending on the same number of circumstances.
---
Not in highsec, I don't.
---
Amarr Empire approves of this post.
---
Which nerfs DD volley. Since in almost perfect conditions you can only get a new titan in and firing every 30-40 seconds.
---
Putting fix and markets together guarantees failure.
---
Kinda tru
---
I honestly expected to be rick rolled.
---
It's not that they are 'used' in massive fleet fights, rather it's that using them allows for massive fleet fights.
---
Something I've wanted for a while is an additional, unavoidable brokers fee on trading PLEX and PLEX-purchased items (like MCT, extractors, but NOT injectors). Idea being that if you are unloading PLEX you bought for RL$, you don't take the hit, but if you're using buy orders to acquire or non-immediate sell orders to unload, you pay more for every time you flip any given PLEX. Using a player market would not allow you to avoid this additional fee.

I fucking hate this narrative that all PvE is mind numbingly boring from people who have been doing the same bullshit for years and now hate themselves.
---
conflict drivers are great, and the keepstar started out that way, alot of fights etc 
---
then the null ppl got bored fighting a never ending war and starting to work together insted, so its not a conflict driver anymore, more then some random wardecs
---
Man you get some great fights in PF. It was my first serious area to get into PVP! I wouldn't say hellcamped but it is a pretty regular area for gatecamping. I mean it's a pipe system from high to null, so that should be expected really. If you ever see a jaguar floating around, he is the alt for a nightmare and a massive dick.
---
Those asteroids hit hard especially spod. Rorqs are always blobbed by asteroids too. How many times can you honestly say that you haven't seen 50x more asteroids than Rorqs in a PvR (player vs. rock) engagement.

The struggle is real. #NerfSpod

Because Snuff never drops Titans in anything in lowsec... Right?

My last fight against them, they only droped 20 titans... LMAO.

This helps people who already made a ton of money through multi boxing. If you have a large cash stack you want a deflated currency because it makes your cash worth even more.

maybe that would make nullsec more dangerous, by making it highsec.
---
Not really lol.
---
It's highly debatable whether you can call Snuff a nullsec alliance. The was a time when they were definitively a lowsec alliance, and although the team up with Imperium muddied the waters a bit I'd say they're mostly back to their roots now.
---
Yeah this seems like a straight-up bad plan.
---
One Snuff Corp had a deployment to Frat space to shit on XIX, calling this another „big betrayal“ because a 60 character corp in snuff individually was lightblue to winterco and brought some dreads to F1 in on an op seems pretty retarded to me but I am sure Vily would deny his alliance an amazing dreadbomb because 8 people have some renters blue
---
Not like we will ever find out because he isn‘t able to provide this type of awesome content lmao
---
Every time.
---
AJAB, amirite
---
This is a bit above my paygrade in terms of experience, but how else do you get hundreds of titans without access to null sec cap ship production?
---
Another change they could make is increase the fee to modify an order from 100 isk to say, 1% of the total order value. That'll capture a lot of wealth disproportionately from rich players. It would get rid of .1 isking and make pricing a more strategic decision.
---
My point was that CCP Falcon was just complaining about wealth distribution and this model is looking to drive MORE people to use services like the TTT which transfer wealth up the chain.
---
More people need to shoot blues. Maybe Eve will be interesting again
---
About the Rorq discussion.  I have found that a combination of issues exist:
---
\- 5 minute industrial core time (self tackled)
---
\- PANIC module (invulnerable as help is organized and arrives)
---
The first item (5 minute industrial core timer) effectively self-tackles the Rorq.  In the grand scheme of things, this makes any use fo a Rorq by a smaller entity very impractical and definitely swings the risk side much greater than the reward side.
---
The PANIC module, which also self-tackles the Rorq, this one I don't have as much issue with but, that time 5-7 minutes, depending on skills sure seems to favor large groups with a ready reaction force.
---
I would recommend shortening the Industrial Core timer down to 1 minute increments with the associated reduced Heavy Water usage per cycle that would still add up to the same usage over time.  This might give the smaller entities a more reasonable risk vs reward for their usage.
---
As for the PANIC module, I really have no solid recommendations as to change at this time, however, if PANIC is either reduced or goes away, this (to me) would be even more justification to reduce the time an Industrial Core is active.

he does it for free and this is how you treat him

Yeah but your ab fit will never get into scram range.
---
NPC trig space would be too reasonable and smart for ccp, so something else haha.
---
Yes, vertical integration will increase profits as you’re not paying for everyone else’s profit margin. For a player to do it, they’re increasing their baseline cost significantly as it requires sometimes, additional infrastructure and more importantly more characters with more skills which also costs isk, time invested into doing it etc.
---
Not to mention for ships like T3’s they need materials like Nanoribbons which will also suffer from the change and gradually add a few percentages to each stage of the production for a T3 or T2.  
---
This isn’t necessarily a negative thing, making it more profitable to take on the huge financial and time investment to completely do the entire line of production; but does affect those smaller producers who source a larger part of their production from the market. 
---
Overall, it’s not a horrible change, increasing costs of ships, even if it’s done through an artificial change like this isn’t a bad thing for the overall economy.

FW bots don't seem to be a secret, they actually exist and you clearly see their pattern behavior - it jumps a system, warp sun, then warp a novice a captures it.
---
However I can't see that huge impact from them (I admit bots are FW cancer and must be removed, but I just want to rise a little bit different question). When FW winning side switched last time, it was done at the speed of light and for both fronts at the same time (GalMil lost their sov at the same time as MinMil did). Squids were capturing 5-6 systems a day for a single front. Who was in charge of it? How was it coordinated? I was asking Plexodus about that, but they literally have no idea of how did that happen. And now whole CalMil is not able to capture Eha and Oicx, so I'm asking you - who were those game changers and where did they go now?

Then I want your stuff cos the VNI will not revert.
---
I have usually done this, I have a well-paying job and I always figured I might as well just pay and play but I find that if I want to make more accounts (I already have 5 accounts) and spec them I really need to find a sustainable way of making some isk. I do carrier rat and I do exploration, but it just feels very.... inefficient.
---
Except the fees are not totally player controlled.
---
This increases total isk sink even for the TTT
---
But the blackout didn't cause that. Snuff has been doing that for ages.
---
 So I have been very interested in wormholes, I was thinking of making an alt for this and trying C3s in a rattlesnake or gila. However, I don’t want to move all my different accounts over WH and usually a corp requires like 15m skillpoints which I wouldn’t have on the specific alt I would want to put into WH
---
SP farming
---
One could only hope
---
Yes, but no mention of avocados or the full MS arsenal.
---
Because the rorq is often on grid with(target from) dreads/drekavac fleet/t3c fleet etc. Its common to see a random number between 1 and 15 rorqs in different "massiv" fleet fights :D
---
What a bunch of bullshit
---
By purchasing them from those who manufacture them in exchange for currency, goods, or services.
---
Or poaching the owners
---
 Exactly I totally agree. I suppose the thing I have a hard time with isn’t so much the grindy behavior. I’ve always played grindy games and I don’t plan on doing it all the time as to where I would get burned out. I would like to try and find something that is a balance in time/isk ratio. I don’t mind initial investment (aka like 3 accounts ratting at once or whatever.) Just so long as I have optimized the specific way I make money, I weirdly enjoy that. Like I know that things like rorq mining increase per account you have so therefore I could find an optimized accounts of like 3 to make 300m/hr or whatever the case is.

The other thing is that 2 years ago they changed panic to require a asteroid locked to activate (prevents use as an invulnerable jump hictor)
---
I do a little bit of trading but playing the .01 isk game every 5 minutes makes me want to stab myself in the neck with a knife. I could see trading in hubs or seeding null.  But I really have no idea how to start that and people who do are not likely to shell out advice (rightly so)

---
honestly anchorable wormhole stabilizers could be interesting. Would need some balance around it, but it could be fun.
---
If they go forward with killing asset safety, would it then be worthwhile for any group to take a crack at them for the loot, or be enough of a temptation to one of the big blocs to break the trade agreement?
---
Ummm, how would that be? Again, no specifics just ranting. I did think of a problem with the idea in the last hour having to do with a specific part of the process. End stealth bombing is hyperbole as all it would require is probing to overcome (which is not ideal). If you thought of it first you could have pointed it out specifically instead of being a neanderthal. That lack of vocality leads me to doubt you actually did conceive of it.
---
But yes, the idea proposed is flawed and untenable. You win...somehow.

Hahah, maybe in null blocs. But individually, not quite.

I invited a friend over to the game and introduced him to it, tried teaching. We went on to look for kills in lowsec in my garmur and his tristan, we eventually found one guy (bait), and a retri pounced on us, by instinct I got the fuck out and he died screaming he clicked warp and how he could be caught. Took me 20 minutes to explain to him that it takes time to warp before u go invul.
---
He rage deleted the game : )
---
Gila has too low dps and tank, praxis is just better in pretty much every respect, especially since sleepers like to shoot drones (use sentries on the praxis). A rattle is more isk/hr than a praxis, but it also costs a lot more if you lose it, so it’s not really worth the price. 
---
But, if you don’t want to move into a wormhole Corp, then you really can’t do any of this, you need a c3 static and a couple scouts or it won’t work well
---
since we weren't bait, no.
---
There wasn't really any "anarchy" between leadership because there wasn't really a leadership. Zack, Jason Baros and Syri had all left the game at that time (each for various reasons).
---
The decision is then taken to move east. At that point there were only a couple fcs around with one of them being the alliance ceo while not really wanting the role.
---
After 2 weeks or so in etherium reach and some fights with unspoken and some other groups there, the alliance ceo wasn't really around and the most active corp at the time decided to leave. That more or less caused the whole thing to stop.
---
tl:dr  "inactive leadership"

Looks like CCP is trying to set up a VAT for the Space Dividend so every capsuleer can get 1000 PLEX a month until they day they biomass.
---
Woosh.

Okay but now watch them delete asset safety and have the combined universe fight for the PLEX pinata
---
Is that even good if its not on a mass amount, last time I looked you basically made 0 profit after buying extractor, MTC and PLEX.
---
Reddit is worse
---
It's called "marketing". You literally get paid for making stuff up without anyone forcing you to actually deliver.
---
Hell yeah brother
---
You dont care about working class at all.
---
Like the .01 isk game? I do that sometimes but without sitting there constantly updating I feel like its hard to make good money.  I have a friend who does it and works from home and makes really good money. So maybe I will go back into that.
---
We are
---
they are called novice plexes for a reason
---
No the brokerage rate is set by the owner. Brokerage fees are separate from sales taxes.
---
Dumb post from OP just asked for no less dumb response.
---
That's not how hubs work though
---
As long as it wasn't VL? Because just shoving 30 capitals through a hole, then stabilizing the next VL hole to the next system would be pretty OP.
---
Why thank you, the idea was to post something equally dumb as the OP.
---
This isn't true. If there was a store next door that charged 0.1% sales tax instead of 5% sales tax. You bet your ass more people are going to shop at that store instead of the 5% one.
---
Overall, I think it's a bad move since it will funnel more money into large corps and take more isk out of the pockets of newer players that don't know any better.
---
That makes sense I would have to look into the praxis for sure.  I would move to wormhole just not on my main I would do it on alts I have a scanning alt and a couple other ones that I could put into one.  I have also heard that using a dread in C5 is really good money but that again seems like a high investment.  But I do appreciate the help!
---
It also raises the base Sales Tax, not just the broker fee so it makes no difference from the system we have now, just a bigger Isk sink in SALES TAX that applies to ALL transactions, both in NPC stations and citadels. Overall removing more isk from the game. Citadels are always gonna be cheaper than NPC stations, there’s no changing that. Rabid change is about reducing inflation not changing the system.
---
I approve of this change
---
even if titans and supers are banned, they can just use the backup strategy which is dreads and carriers
---
I would like to request a pic of you and your Nieve body pillow. I promise nothing disrespectful will cum of it. 
---
Huge fan, btw...
---
This is playing out exactly like real life lol
---
Stealth buff to trading skills?
---
So CCP is marketing their massive space battles on people getting hot dropped while mining and under an umbrella? 
---
Well I guess they can't do it on citadel battles as that is just a week long waste of time
---
I’m assuming Imbor is coming back?
---
True, I was thinking more about the time limits, rather than mass limits. But I guess both are relevant. Perhaps the wormhole stabilizer could basically regen a certain amount of mass per hour? So you could send a couple caps through an hour without closing the hole, but more than that could still collapse it?
---
It's only a weakness against another group that can cause said timers and tidi.  If you can find a group that will burn out less quickly than 80000 dudes, more power to you.
---
But less than for NPC stations, which means more people will use the TTT
---
I would never have entered a wormhole in 2013,but now I'm just yoloing it, bookmarking my exits and doing explo.
---
Anything you do over and over again is mindbogglingly boring.  Unless... you have the mental age of, say, 5.  You know, they like to watch the same movie over and over again.
---
I mean, if you can convince a c5 Corp with a fort to let you join with a dread pilot, but not your main, then that would be good, but I doubt you’ll be able to do that. Really, finding any good Corp that would allow you to join with only an alt doesn’t sound too easy, pvp corps will want you in to help them pvp and krab Corps would think you’re an obvious spy.
---
Tfw people still fall for the mining meme. We have so much ore in the market since 2003 that we don't really need more ore anymore. Just open market browser and right click buy instead suggesting ideas to 'fix' 'mining'.
---
Players will save more not trading in npc structures.
---
What we need is "no local" for markets.  That is, you can't see the prices of anything.  You just bid when you're buying and take a random guess when you're selling.
---
The question is, is my idea serious or am I being extremely silly?
---
Let's just blackout the market instead. Market intel is op.
---
Sounds like EVE is definitely for him
---
First start with the problem the idea is trying to solve.  At least half your essay should concern this.  You know, lay out the groundwork.
---
Thanks for recording
---
The perceived problem is groups bunching up. The big scary umbrella. If you effectively cut the amount of max ore a region can provide in half or less, you could.. possibly, I'm not sure just spit balling, cause some groups to spread out.
---
Game I use to play dis this. Even if u lost ur bid you wouldn’t get the money back lol was brutal.
---
Darkorbit use to be great
---
So, would your suggestion be to stop ore from entering the market by removing mining from the game?
---
I watched many Eve streamers over the weekend and every single one had to fly far and wide to find any pvp content. 
---
The reality is not what we are being told here and on the forums. 
---
Less players = less content. And we certainly know that most 'elite pvpers' will shy away from a combat ship vs. combat ship situation... unless it's a 20:1 blob.
---
This is CCP, they will have implement the feature, and then fuck off for some other "shiny" thing that will be implemented next
---
Leaving the system hilariously broken and not fixed for years lol
---
what are you guys smoking?
---
What do you use? I have seen the one on even uni but it seems incredibly detailed almost to a fault for a corp of only 5 or less people on any given op.
---
Those Onion guys, always causing trouble. 
---
Don't stop
---
Yeah I totally understand. I would think the same thing too. Which is slightly unfortunate.  But still maybe in the future I will fully committe to the wormhole life!
---
24 hour lock timers to change the price or remove. But add an option to lock/black out and you get it back in 24 hours for those instances you fuck up a posting.
---
Let them actually fight instead of having to take care of ADM, NPC invasions and whatever PVE change they are gonna introduce? And balance things to make fights fun, having fun should be at least 90% the reason you fight in a game.
---
As long as I can play as Bam Bam Bigelow
---
* hilarious 90s wwf wrestling
---
did the 61 lawyers threaten to sue you if you didnt say that?
---
What no one seems to realize is that changes made to kill bots are changes that also kill players, especially when you consider the volume that some items are traded, this change would make it virtually impossible to update your price ever.
---
Oh, you got undercut? Well that's too bad, unless you want to lose an enormous amount of isk, you're stick until the next order finishes.
---
wut?
---
This is why I try to do my injector sales (240/mo.) and PLEX buying when the 0-.1% ones are up. Saves a non-trivial amount of isk. If tax rates were stable at .3% it would be more compelling to use TTT and do it at regular intervals.
---
Some of us have weak hearts, ***Thanks***
---
All 8 seasons are pretty good.
---
Send it into a black hole.
---
Well since every single day there's a massive battle because a rorq got tackled in X space, yes. Without the PANIC module, that fight would never happen because the rorq would die. 
---
Not really sure why you're bringing up citadels now...
---
That would be epic!
---
OHNOES
---
Jita market bots unsub en masse
---
Yep.  
---
Woot...ships die in Null.  
---
Thanks blackout.
---
How much time do you want to spend PVEing to sub more accounts vs playing how you want? I guess that's what it comes down to. If the financial side of it just makes sense to inject alts, they can be SP farmed for basically a net-neutral cost for the account, so long as you don't mind not training
---
u/MrGothmog pretty much hit the nail on the head. I'd add that there are also small number of titan/super markets in lowsec where anyone can shop. They're more expensive, and getting them out is risky, but it happens. iirc, the keepstar that TEST dropped after the battle of UALX used to be one. I think we bought it from Matteral (on air) after Goons reinforced it and threatened to destroy it if he didn't take it down.
---
No. That would be a bad idea.
---
Well they already have that one, he probably means other ones. My favorite is a Talos
---
yeah that is pretty freakin spot on
---
anything that makes bots unsub is A-OK in my book
---
it's funny how that article neglects the part where we repeatedly brought the issues up, elaborated on how it can be exploited, and then watched as CCP implemented it anyways. Also if you think Goons were the only ones doing this you're very mistaken. Congrats to finding a biased article though!
---
Black rise is full of blobbers they will bring bunch of gays to pile on your t1 frig and call it gf in local.
---
I'd easily pay 20-30% more to buy a ship + fit in one place rather than spending 30 jumps to get it all. 
---
Sorry bro, I don't have time for that shit
---
Lmao horde or test is the same.
---
I’d be willing to tell you how to do it and give you a list of items to start with that I no longer trade... for a cut of your profit for the first few months. Lmk if interested. In game: Fisher Kel
---
It was for a while, but they slowpoked on this super hard. Two years?
---
After it got leaked and other groups started doing it.
---
This would effectively kill my ability to do market warfare
---
Wormhole is solo is very doable. You make it sound impossible... You don't HAVE to join any corp although it can make things easier.
---
IF they have the knowledge to do so. Newer players dont.
---
But how do you know that?
---
No, they are bots.  They were completely ignoring other ventures, even hostile ones.  Anything else comes to within 1au they split from the plex like clockwork.
---
But you could sit on grid with it for FOUR FUCKING HOURS and it never moved.

---
Do you see a significant drop from a month ago? I don't.
---
Sure people moved a bit. Null sec population is a bit more concentrated in smaller pockets, but there hasn't been a mass player exodus like some people are crying.
---
I certainly haven't had issues finding fights. The number of kills I have this month is only 18 less then last month, and I still have 3 days to make up the difference.
---
But hey. Don't let facts stop you. Keep crying about the Blackout. Please don't let the door hit you on your way out.

P.S. Wormholer btw

Post hoc ergo propter hoc.
---
I mean, if you don't want to shoot blues you could just reset standings
---
This guy gets it
---
What problem does this aim to solve? 
---
This is basically the opposite of the current system where 'activity' increases rewards. This would punish people for their 'activity' and remove the important loop of today's work for tomorrow's reward.
---
I predict an increase of business for the Standing Correction Agency service.
---
So, by turbo mining and causing a faster respawn - people should be rewarded with faster repawns and even more ore in the same system? Is that what you are saying? I'm not clear on it.
---
it depends on how many acc's you have to sustain and what are you able to fly properly...market trading is not the easiest one due some heavy upfront cost and experience aside. Doing just average 10 to 20% margin via null sec markt seeding with roughly 50 bil in the market market, you can easily supply 2 acc's without any hard work. You need 2 acc's to do so properly both at least blockade runner + deep space transporter, 1 acc is doable but a little too risky doing logistics without scouts. 
---
add any other activity as supplement to grid some extra isk and voila, decent isk over time. You need more isk? Either get more chars in order to supply other regions or move to C5/C6. 
---
If you're part of a wh corp well you earn pretty well by simply high class wh's grinding with dreads. 
---
Not quite sure how well you get paid by participating in killing incursion motherships in low sec when Revenant bpc's drops(don't have numbers so can't project average income). Also no clue on faction capital ship bpc farming. 
---
If you don't mind doing shady business: scamming/asset stealing and eviction of inactive wh corps (however it is a hit and miss activity, either you get some good isk or you don't).
---
I'm saying that's how it works now. By putting in effort, you are rewarded. Why shouldn't you be rewarded with a faster respawn and more ore after slaving through a bunch of tiny ass belts, and then work every day to maintain it?
---
Your suggestion is the opposite. Reward players for not playing, and once they've not played enough, give them a big reward.
---
Glad ikitursas are getting cheaper, they really rip shit up
---
CCP throws ball of shit on wall, then waits for Reddit non null, non rorqual pilots to chime in  and agree with them.   CCP nerfs Null and Nerfs Rorqual.
---
The exception is Supers, where if you ping for Supers 100 people will all show up in Supers they bought themselves. Then again, supers can be used to rat with so people will buy supers of their own volition.
---
Rorquals need to go back to their role of being a mining support ships and not a mining ship.
---
Already replaced ?
---
&gt; Moon ore doesn't spawn in high sec
---
Are you sure?
---
This thread and every post in it is retarded.  
---
Including this post.
---
taxes are always passed down to cost the costumer more...
---
I love theorycrafting ships specifically for jumping from High-sec into a Tama gatecamp. Then watching how my fit didn't work and exploding.
---
I also love coming up with ships designed to orbit a gate at 150km and antagonise the gate-campers with drones. Also in Tama.
---
I guess I love Tama...
---
Could make modifying orders expensive so .01 isk bots end up wasting a lot of money.
---
Also very relevant username.
---
It depends on what kind of PvP you want. If it's big fleets, then sure they got that. Giant gate camps? They got that. Small gang roams? Not so much.
---
Mining faster to get a belt to respawn shouldn't be seen as the reward. The actual ore is what you are after. They are looking at resource availability, so approaching it as though nothing will change is probably not going to be the outcome. You still would need to mine the ore under the new system, it would just be time gated by maximum amount available to cause player drift.  As it stands, do you really see the system working with each upgradeable system work 30-40b in ore per day? You also aren't getting me when I say that the normal asteroid belts would have rocks the same size as a colossal. A 24 hour refresh would see a belt with a full colossal worth of ABC ore as well as a full colossal of the low/high sec ore. Every 8 hours, 33 % would respawn. This would effectively cut in half what a system can be mined for unless you get a system with 10-12 belts.
---
There's plenty of real life examples. People from Massachusetts go to New Hampshire all the time to buy stuff. Finn will take the ferry to Estonia to buy low-tax alcohol.
---
Didn't Hilmar say in the TiS show that the blackout would last at least until December?
---
1. About a second, Mebbe 2
---
2. Yeah if you hit warp before they grab you
---
3. From the sounds of it, your best bet is warp in, scan can(s) and grab best 1-2, then gtfo. Of course your spending time while scanning so balance that with hacking, so....
---
I hear this a lot but the logistics of worm holes makes my head hurt.... someday maybe
---
Getting rid of asset safety would force most people out of structures. There's a reason most people don't bother with WHs. If you bring WH mechanics to K-space, you're just going to force people to quit EVE.
---
I mean that still isn't really definite.
---
The last time they hiked sales taxes it basically killed the smaller hubs by pushing more people into the perimeter trading forts. Same thing is probably going to happen, prices in amarr will spike, traders in jita will move to ttt and amarr will go the way of Dixie/rens
---
We're in the Age of Chaos, baby.   Are you taking your stress medications yet?   ;-)
---
Nope... Cans blow up as the rats spawn. Which will 1shot any exploration frigate, let alone a ceptor. Have you even done one lol
---
Thanks Obama...
---
Nope. They think a decade old UI system and late 90's gameplay and pacing can still be significant in this current era of gaming. That's why I'm super apprenseive of putting any money towards my account for Omega as well.
---
The problem with exploration is the game you invest waiting for scans to finish is way to long. You can get lucky but it’s not like there is way to make it a constant stream of income without it being a full time gig.
---
Sure, so when is Brave starting a war against Goons, Horde, and TEST?
---
yes - and the OP wants npc fees on citadels, which is exactly what the sales tax is.
---
Taxes are theft
---
They could add a base npc tax even for citadels, but they aren't, at least not this time.
---
Part of the reason why I don't play this game anymore. I mentioned a few years back that the fun to time ratio in pvp is waaaaaay off. Its not worth roaming for 3 hours to get 1 engagement that ends in 3 minutes. Once, me and a few friends roamed WH for 12 hours and got nothing, on the off chance we found someone, they would just run away.
---
delet mining
---
I'm starting to get a nice pattern of trigger words for the downvote bots. Keep posting.
---
That said, no, the dram is fine, the problem is the others are OP.
---
You're completely right. Thankfully there is enough to do in Eve that it usually takes people a few years to experience it all.
---
No he’s talking about applying a percentage of the brokers fee for the region/system brokers fee of the owner is how I read it
---
I don't know what timeline or universe I got sucked into... to be agreeing with Capable and Braxus... In regards to Tsukino, pretty funny when you know the entirety of a conversation just from the first post. Insert strong, unsupported opinions. Double down. Insert edgey memes/yikes/megacringe comments and another double down. Insert personal attacks to cover retreat.
---
Yeah, if they came down another few hundred mil, that'd be great though :D
---
All ore spawns in 1 system per region. Thunderdome mining.
---
I like it but this will give the market pvp players a great way to kill the market really quick
---
&gt;This isn't true. If there was a store next door that charged 0.1% sales tax instead of 5% sales tax. You bet your ass more people are going to shop at that store instead of the 5% one.
---
People shop at the store that has the most convenient parking lot.    You can bet your ass most people don't even know what their sales tax rate is.
---
" We plan on just buying all the assets from Cloud Imperium Games’ Star Citizen project, as they’re basically all just EVE ships anyways.”
---
It's long sighted actually. In a sandbox mmo where most of the content is player made PVP in it's different forms is  the best way to create content. It also keeps the economy running. Stuff exploding creates demand for new ships/modules to replace losses.
---
Op asked for explanation why pve players are disliked and I gave my view. You don't have to like it but that is how games like this work. Of course it is not that simple and there are forms of PVE that are better for game and content creation than others.
---
They made a conflict driver *for the largest groups in highsec*. The same groups that have an agreement to avoid conflict so they can share in the profits.
---
They were? Where/when? I legitimately missed it and am sincerely curious. The only time I've personally seen this, it was Mittani/Goons moaning about it, with no sources cited.
---
As someone said before me. Every person thinks their play style is the right play style. And everyone else plays the game wrong.
---
To you PvP causes stress, to me it gives an adrenaline rush. So I enjoy it more. But I PvE as well to fund my PvP habbit. I don't hate PvE people. What bothers me more are people who drop 30 guys on a single roaming cruiser and  then feel the need to warp in a falcon or blackbird on top of that. I hate those guy way way more. But even so I understand their mentality of wanting to win more then get a good fight. I try not to hate anyone, but I dislike those people more then others.
---
Yes, never not trust a friendly SinAlarma!
---
so he wants an npc tax in citadels. which we already have.
---
Except the highsec “bankers” are not affected by this change. At least not negatively.
---
Have to agree being on the receiving end of Invicta currently in the process of demolishing our LS pocket in Everyshore.
---
&gt;By putting in effort, you are rewarded.
---
This reward breaks the game. There's a fine line between reasonable rewards and "rich-get-richer mechanics".
---
You can join an NPC corp that's in FW. 
---
24th imperial crusade for amarr
---
Tribal liberation for minmatar
---
State protectorate for caldari
---
Federal defense union for gallente
---
Alternatively, just go to a fw region and start shooting at anyone you wander into
---
Oh, I'm well aware that these guys will be slippery. Heck, I already know some of them are elite players. I'll need to be extremely heady and sneaky, and probably recruit some help.
---
That's ok. It keeps me engaged longer.
---
100% at least they're increasing the sales tax, though increasing broker will just mean more players going to TTT and hell TAPI can probably even justify increasing their tax as well, since they're still way lower than NPC... &gt;.&gt;
---
Cool, now take a risky screenshot of your mouse hovering over "repackage ship".
---
Have you asked those streamers what they think about the changes?
---
It might take some time for null to get populated again when people learn to play in this new meta. Sudden changes like this aren't common in Eve.
---
No additional broker fees that are separate from taxes applied in addition to whatever the station owner sets it’s broker rate at
---
Yes, but Arya's people could only die once, so I suspect she was content if they met a premature end no matter whose hands brought it about.
---
Mine, though...mine will die many times, so they need to either die by my hand or quit the game before I am satisfied.
---
that's not purple
---
In before Vily crawls out to cr...
---
too late
---
...which is exactly what the sales tax is.
---
No, these are 100000% bots.  Always warp to sun at zero, always run from anything that isn't another venture, you can kill them and the pod will sit there for hours in the plex, etc
---
Nah, market orders will just adapt to include the new taxes.
---
Can confirm janitors are not humans
---
Source: was a janitor for 2 years
---
Not enough character.
---
The heart of the problem imho is kill mails and zkill. If we were unable to export killmails then people would become FAR less attached to being Leet isk efficient on kills/losses.
---
Our wormhole group exclusively looks for fleet fights. We may shoot a VNI etc if we stumble across one that’s afk and dumb, but usually only to try and get a response fleet.
---
Response fleets no longer respond. You get supers or nothing now, so we no longer bother even trying to kill ratters. 
---
It’s honestly extremely disheartening to roam for 3+ hours and watch ratting supers dock, structures with 20-50 characters docked who claim our 10 man T1 non cloaky fleet is bullying them, and find zero fleets in space until we either go home tired, or get super dropped and scatter home or die.
---
Roaming has been dead for years now, only few really talented groups did it succesfully and still it took a lot of time/effort. Now it's bit easier again but still hard as hell.
---
Crazy talk.
---
they both still have better ideas than most posters on r/eve
---
Attention whores don't anger me, think pity is more how I feel towards you ;thinking;

If the bomb hits the gate it doesn’t explode

This is only a problem in the beginning. Get some skills. Both ingame skills and your personal skills. Scanning is only as slow as you and your skills. There are many trick on how to place your probes right and with skills you can halve the time any scan takes and other skills make let you find sites in less scans.
---
No, but the "I mined it so it's roughly 3% or so plus whatever the markup of the trader is cheaper, thanks to the skills I have trained in the past ten years" people can now say 5% instead.
---
I always recommend new players to start with really low level pvp. For example hunting cynos with the map statistics. That way you dont get frustrated immediately because you lose every fight.

Torpedo Bomber works fine if you use dual Target Painters

---
As part of a number of changes over the course of the summer, we’re planning to make some alterations to sales taxes and brokers fees associated with the market.
---
These changes will mean increases in sales taxes and brokers fees but will also include changes to the bonuses a character receives from tax related skills.
---
Here’s a rundown of the changes that will be made soon. These changes will be live on Singularity tomorrow for testing.
---
Changes to sales taxes and broker fees:
---
* Maximum Sales Tax increase from 2% to 5%.
---
* Minimum Sales Tax increase from 1% to 2.25%.
---
* Maximum Brokers Fee increase for NPC stations from 3% to 5%.
---
* Double the total maximum taxation from 5% to 10%.
---
* Increased total minimum taxation on NPC structures from 3% to 5.25%.
---
* Increase the minimum taxation on player owned structures by 125% from 1% to 2.25%.
---
Changes to tax associated skills:
---
* Accounting – Increase in reduction of sales tax from 10% per level to 11% per level.
---
* Brokers Relations – Increase in reduction of costs associated with setting up a market order from 0.1% per level to 0.3% per level.
---
The total benefit from skills will increase from 2% (current benefit) to 4.75%, which translates to a total tax reduction (including standings benefits) of 47.5% instead of the current 40%.
---
As always, we’re open to hearing feedback from the community and we’re more than happy to discuss these changes.
---
[If you have any comments regarding these changes, feel free to head on over to the discussion thread on the EVE Online Forums!](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/devblog-updates-to-sales-taxes-brokers-fees/178876)
---
So nothing should never bother trying to fix anything? The current system is broken and needs to be fixed. Are there other ways to approach it? Yes but I also don't think one change can fix it all at once. They are going to need to change many things rather than one large change.

When I was born few years ago in New Eden, I was told to keep skins, as their value was going up with time, now thing is I really don't care about these and I have quite a lot. So I just want to start to sell it. Question is, what's the best to sell them ? Common market ?
---
It means that your descendants are destined for greatness
---
I´m afraid I can´t answer that, Dave!
---
or the punisher, slicer, garmur, retri, kestrel, condor.
---
It means you are in a Crystal Quarry site. It’s a cute joke. Check the info to see what is in there.

But yeah. It’s always fun to scan one of those down and see that.   Also good to see someone in a Heron.

---

---
Yep, it checks out
---
I can fully get behind this, people just seem to rage more when you go around saying things are OP
---
Perfect. Hahaha
---
if that is how you PVP I can see why its boring for you
---
People need an income to pvp, what you are proposing will potentially punish people for using  and owning space again 
---
If you own a little space but maximise with members you end up worse off that people who dont at all 
---
It's a system that punishes instead of rewards 
---
You want people on nullsec not chase them off 
---
They will all just do level 4s in highsec again
---
Well CONCORD never said they wouldn't raise the taxes so no.
---
See, he's ded.. D E D, ded.
---
I'm not sure which various timelines you're talking about. I'm talking about now and a month ago before the blackout. The drop from a month ago is not that big.
---
If you're looking at other periods then the drop from those is not due to the blackout.
---
You are coming in late a couple of years, the damage has been done.
---
Drone Regions have needed a NPC constellation or area for such a long time so I hope so.
---
was just going for something like this  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZBgxYzh\_G0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZBgxYzh_G0) all i really changed was adding the armor rep.
---
I mean they basically already do. Or, at least, those aligned with the Blood Raiders do so in some capacity.
---
tbh, I don't expect many people would move their trade because of this, Jita will just increase the margin between sell and buy orders till it makes profit again.
---
You could, but that sounds like an activity that's going to net you few points because the losses are small.  Exploit enough for it to matter, and you're incurring significant losses.
---
Like everything else, it'd have to be balanced right.  What doesn't work, and never really has worked, is "capture the flag" mechanics in an open sandbox game where server bandwidth is always a finite resource that can always be overloaded when epeen is on the line.  Capture the flag really only works well in instanced arenas.  
---
The other thing that doesn't really work is making structure bashing and structure spamming the only things that really matter in sov warfare.  It's what drives the formation of mega-blocs in the first place, and motivates un-fun tactics like "weaponized boredom" and time-zone tanking.
---
If you live in your space and you actively defend it and have strong control of it you should have a strong claim.  If you have little to no control over it you should have a weak claim, or lose your claim altogether.  Make that work, instead of artificial mechanics based on capture the flag and structure bashing, and large scale wars might actually be fun.
---
The down-votes are fun.  If you go into my posting history you'll find recommendations for getting rid of local and NPCs that can actually hurt you that got down-voted too.  We'll see where CCP goes with it.  
---
Looks to me like they are intent on making the formation of big blocs less and less advantageous in the first place, which would relieve them from the need to make war between blocs fun.
---
Or people can go to wormholes for this.  The obsession with making it safer and easier for hunters is pathetic
---
glevon was right

What does this have to do with multi-boxing, and since when is multi-boxing the enemy? Are you conflating multi-boxing with botting?

And then there's the true issue farmers see, if they give you content now, there will be more coming over looking for content, meaning even more disrupted farming.
---
So the real issue, is that there's nothing you can do to hurt them, if they choose to wait it out till you leave.
---
This isn't about hunters or safety? I think you are in the wrong post amigo. This is purely about mining.
---
does your list include the potential for wars? that would be more fun :D
---
So, nothing changed?
---
If this comment is at the top of best... then there must be a massive amount of downvotes on phprazor's comment considering it's still +100.
---
Nah, keep them expensive as heck. That way we wont see to many of our fleets flying around :D
---
"without being renters"

The QFC occupancy agreement is longer than most rental agreements IRL

my jaw unironically dropped. First time I've been successfully onion'd in like 12 years
---
Different timelines use different averages.
---
Dual tanking ships tends to just lead to worse results. Build ships for one purpose, with similar tank types. Things like AAR+Plate or LSE+ ASB work because those are straight EHP gains over double LSE or double plate (not that most small gang/solo fits have the fitting for double plate). 
---
Mixing armor and shield together is almost always a bad case, and the niche use cases for it are extremely small. 
---
You’d get more out of working a BCS into the lows, or more speed, etc.
---
High sec, low sec and high sec honestly needs to be segregated to a degree. The null sec powers will always be around and high sec will never compete with them. Otherwise you're just going to have the same shit as null sec dominating low sec with overwhelming mass.
---
Yeah I will have to check that out as far as I knew SP farms were kind of dead with all the costs.
---
On a scale of serious to local blackout silly... this is probably rated as a solid buff rorquals.

I hear that OxyClean does a good job of removing caked-on rebel scum from the walls of your trash compactor.

From what I can tell finding the right wormhole is what makes it more difficult?

It's at a loss of like 100m for a month iirc, but that's seriously insignificant

Yeah, that'd be great i'll shoot you a message in a few hours!
---
Sir your patient forward-leaning mindset and logic has no place on this subreddit.
---
That is all.
---
It's almost as if CCP doesn't actually know what they're doing. They are the ones who broke null sec in the first place or did we all forget that.
---
Surely you understand the difference between defense and offense in terms of draining one's will to persevere, right?
---
well... Texas law is Texas law
---
They downvote me to hide the fact that they are doing exactly what i say.
---
Yep, all the titans built in last year were built with ore mined in 2003.
---
This post hurt my chest
---
the fatal flaw is: the buyer pays the taxes - so just simply raising the taxes to concord doesn't have any desired effect. Since you can calculate the product value, any bot  can be set to certain item value, where it is still profitable enough. Yes, there will be less 0,01 ISK like bargening and I kind of welcome it since I'm seeding manually and 0,01 ISK ruining the true marketing. However you have 325 order to fill, so you can seed smaller amounts of an item in orders and auto-replesh if bought by a customer. Hell you even don't need an omega account, create enough alphas create a login script checking esi for bought items, set value of login wait period to a RNG and voila. If there is a will, there will be a way. 
---
I apreciate the idea though.
---
Asset safety was a bad idea. Items stored inside destructible structures should be at full risk of getting destroyed/looted, just like before. That's some incentive to actually attack something.
---
2001:  A Space Odyssey reference.
---
I currently have 5 accounts that I regularly use.  The probably I assume with seeding markets is I cant imagine that the markets would be well off to make profit because I would guess everyone already has them under control?  I really do not know and have not done enough research into it to see if it would be viable.  
---
With the faction capital bpc I have never looked into that but I would assume again that it would be difficult to get into.  Is that something that pays out well?
---
The shady business i would find to be enjoyable but wouldn't rely on it too much for actual income more of a fun/hr.
---
Are you trolling?  Please tell me you’re trolling
---
Or you could just write code to watch every sale in Jita and other hubs with the goal of detecting non human interactions with the game client.
---
The reason they never did this was because the bots being online make the game look more full drawing more real people to it. 1/3 or more of the players online are bots either marketing or farming it has been this way for 15 years. 
---
Now this is trouble because they have allowed bots to farm up trillions of isk for the people using them they paid for that free advertisement of "hey we got people playing here come join the party" those people will never pay for the game they do not need to, they fund entire alliances with macro farmers, this drove conflict and created content for CCP. They needed that to keep it interesting. 
---
As a side note, if I told you right now I know someone that back in the day was paying her monthly rent by selling ISK for real money by harvesting moon goo would you be surprised my summer child?
---
To understand Eve you must break the spell of Eve and or CCP being smart! 
---
Climb to the top of the mountain and see what burns! What drives the game? The game is rigged and by that I mean people have formed teams of people that have out thought and out played the CCP devs. The CCP game designers are fucking morons.
---
Once you see the ugly truth you might be like me a person who ever cheated using macro bots who continues to play for another 6+ years before giving it up or join with the cheaters or you walk away and find a new form of entertainment.
---
I gave CCP a decade to fix the troubles with the game they did nothing but waste my sub money on ill conceived projects and mismanagement.
---
Fuck em the day they close CCP in Iceland and move that shit to a place where real devs work is the best day for Eve. All the great minds that created Eve left 15+ years ago.
---
It means you might be gay.
---
Prove it
---
Doesn’t everyone know this? Just like when you warp to your instadock in jita you put autopilot on? Or moving JFs/supers...
---
Oh is that all? Because of plex prices dropping?  so realistically set up 2 PI/SP farms per account of say 6 accounts and it pretty much pays for itself right there?  I know PI is literal cancer but if that would be about all it takes to start that would be decent passive income.
---
Then choose your fights better
---
We SRP supers, though.
---
fun fact, your average eve player is even more retared than your average r/eve poster, i dont envy being a ccp employee who has to communicate with the player base
---
They also have a $5 starter pack dlc with 1mil sp &amp; a cerebral accelerator with +3 &amp; 20% more Damage for any character under 35 days old. 
---
But that mil sp I threw on my main. Hehehe
---
You're both dumb.
---
We used to just put MWDs in F1 slot and a quid on the key, worked well for getting you through HS )
---
Tbh you'd have to ask someone more qualified than me about it all. I've just returned to eve again and am not sure about the current prices
---
y-yeehaw pardner *SWEATS NERVOUSLY*
---
Asset safety was a good idea and was one of the best changes they have ever made.  There is still risk even without the items being destroyed  in the structures.  You can add incentive in other ways and they should.  Asset safety is not an issue.
---
Was there any warning or head's up about this change?
---
Seems fairly substantial change to give zero warning...
---
What's the adapt part of this?
---
Ok, so use unfit insured battleships or rorqs. This just doesn’t work without rebalancing insurance payouts or something, which starts a whole other chain of events. 
---
Either you need to kill a metric fuckton of stuff to make it significant, in which case it’s a stupid mechanic, or it’s easy to game. 
---
Thank god CCP bravely ignored the downvotes and listened to your unique suggestions on removing local and increasing rat damage. Where should I send your isk for saving eve?
---
No worries! Still gives me something to think about, I appreciate it!
---
Cheers, appreciate constructive criticism.
---
in high sec stations?  I dont even have a clone there.  Also calm your tits down and wipe the spittle off your chin.
---
All grr Gons and fuck PL aside. Can we finally admit that perhaps CCP doesn't know how to clean up the mess they made? Raising taxes obviously doesn't help the average person compete and Blackout is fun and all but it's so broken right now. Corp killed 10 bil plus in like two hours just jumping around in stealth bombers. All this talk about risk and hunting jews is one of the most risk averse activities out there now. Not saying changes shouldn't be made to null but undocking to rat in anything less than a capital is a death sentence. Buffer tanked Rattlesnake? Blown out of the water in an instant. Can't warp off. Can't see what's coming. Can't fight back. Sucks for that guy. All the risk and no reward for thee and not for me.
---
Imagine being this desperate for attention.
---
Honestly, are you surprised? That CCP clearly doesnt even know how their own product works.
---
I'd love a reason why
---
I think they want to push for hisec market conflict but it's giga autistic so fuck that
---
Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.
---
I just started station trading again earlier this month. Noticed last night I've paid roughly 500M isk in just brokerage charges this month, thats half a months subscription. Not sure I understand the increase.
---
It means you need to turn your AA up

Texas has religion... REVOLTING COCKS ARE GOD!

Janitor died for your sins.
---
It is just a fun shoop I did, I thought it was quite fitting.   
---
In case you missed the references in it, the PLEX, the CCP under the man, and the book.
---
I know that, but the initial capital investment to buy the super/titan is almost entirely in the hand of individual players after the first handful of corp/alliance crowd funded titans. That kind of time donation to the higher level organization is unmatched in other games.
---
See https://www.eveonline.com/article/pv9fkn/changes-to-the-recruitment-program-coming-soon and that article was already shared iirc
---
If you see dozens of sales orders on market in Jita, they are not worth much.
---
If you see only a couple sales orders, hold until there are next to none available. 
---
Rare skins draw significant value, especially ones sold for limited times or given away at events.
---
we can only hope :-)
---
Becouse inflation, theres too many isk faucets in the game compared to the isk sinks. More isk needs to go away.
---
Its such an awful idea.
---
A tasty corpse nonetheless
---
This post was made by drifter gang
---
1. if you see them you should be already in a warp, otherwise say bye bye to your boat. I can't confirm whether the rats have a superpoint or not in case you being stabbed.
---
2. yes, any disconnects to a can not being hacked means your ships pops
---
3. the issue with an interceptor is the hacking difficulty since no bonus to hacking. Bad luck on virus defenses and you still die, with or without npc being spawned. Though get a t1 standard scanning frigate if possible until you're confident enough to risk a T2 scanning frigate or an astero. 
---
If your question is whether you can compensate hacking strength with imps to get to bonuses of a T1 standard frigate - someway possible but unpractical since those imps have a malus to coherence...and if I'm recall they where for data sides only. So at this point you can't compensate.
---
Take your upvote
---
It is funny because it's true
---
Vily, you werent satisfied with raising the fee so now you made CCP raise theirs as well. Bad Vily, bad!

Using T2 or augmented drones

Isnt WHs an only blue loot thing? Wont they be affected the worst? I would very much like this change if it is.
---
So, the good news.  
---
-More isk sinking,  
---
-A conflict driver, which may become a mineral sink  
---
-Neat lore, makes sense.
---
Bad News,  
---
-More boring structure bashes
---
-markets currently owned by the SerenityDonut Inc, and will likely stay that way
---
-Conflict will be restricted exclusively to the Ferox again
---
Holy shit dramiels are so good. Damage isn’t what you should be focusing on if you’re flying one.
---
To be technical, there are more sinks: skillbooks and other items that arent' created by nor gifted to people, so any such items being bought means isk goes eventually out of the game. 
---
Another more significant sink is people quitting (effectively tying up isk into their account long term or indefinitely ). 
---
And of course bans and penalties.
---
it means that YOU NEED TO DSCAN
---
Sad but true. I've seen some of the state financials, so I get why everything's going up, but that doesn't make it suck less.
---
What is that program you use to track your scanned sigs?
---
It was only supposed to be a joke comment. But in a real-world level, tax revenue is often squandered and mismanaged by governments, we see vast sums of taxes poured into collapsing services like schools and healthcare without so much as a meagre improvement in services. This is an inherent flaw in government operation, especially at large state levels. Does this mean that there needs to be zero tax? Nope.  
---
In the US, education funding (per student) has tripled since the 1960s (adjusted for inflation) and yet we see little improvement to test scores or opportunity outcomes. This is precisely because officials and the structure of governments are pretty ineffective. Localised spending and control is always superior. So no taxes? No way, what we need is localised control of tax expenditure, not some official in Washington deciding what a failing school needs across the country. This is a deep topic not really ideal for a comment but anyway. This is very watered down summation.
---
If you enjoy making money 90% of this reddit *including* the ccp rep that posts here often literally hates you and your playstyle.

Probably the wrong place to ask
---
Since you brought Him up do have a moment to discuss the 2nd greatest man who ever lived? A man who was whose only flaw was loosing a war against the entire world? A man who was compassionate to the 2 million strong army that tried to turn his country into a cesspool via violent communist revolution and was vilified throughout world by the enemies of his people?
---
Hilmar is not fit to tie that Great Man's shoe-laces let alone be considered His equal. ¡tonto pinche joto!

Gas huff in high class WHs will do it. Relics, with some luck, will also net you that much.

Ah yes, forgot to add to my comment, translates to " No funny business "
---
So he hates the richest groups in eve, but then implements things that mostly punishes everyone else? This hike isn't even going to be on the radar for them, but that small manufacturing corp? Yikes... stay classy CCP
---
That's simply not.possible. Coordination amongst the null sec blocks happens outside the client, and anything outside the client CCP has very few ways to influence.
---
Should have added "and dont forget to subscribe to the new Neveonion"
---
&gt;A small shield extender is roughly 9.4k in Jita, but they sell for nearly 50k in Gravity Well. At that point the slight increase in taxes will not have an significant effect on the seller.
---
Brokerage fees are calculated relative to the total value of the item sold. The fees increase proportionately with the magnitude that you are trying to sell the item. The larger margin is subject to larger fees. In other words, you pay more fees in Gravity Well on that item than you would in Jita. The net effect will be a further increase in prices for client.
---
But that Asset Danger part was real, right?
---
because capitalism is better than socialism
---
CCP Falcon is relieved to learn this.

No one could heard anything between Komo's kids yelling and Syrianna eating during fleets.

The Gallente tried their best to bring the Caldari into the fold (read: cultural homogenization) but the Caldari weren't having it. The Federation forbid its various constituents from establishing their own colonies without its consent, and the Federation usually governed those colonies.
---
The Caldari decided they wanted to remain Caldari more than they wanted to be Gallente, so they went ahead and created their own colonies anyway. When the Federation discovered these colonies, they demanded the Caldari cede governance of the colonies over to the Federation.
---
The Caldari weren't having any of that shit.
---
So at the end of the day, this is an SP sink rather than an ISK sink
---
how exactly do you have to invite to get the free sp
---
Clearly they had a falling out and one guy unsubbed with half the alliance loot so they had to break off and form their own alliance.
---
i really wish they would
---
That’s what I meant with the “muh ticks” closing comment, and it’s just sad to me that people are so addicted to farming InterStellarKredits. I suppose the Zkill thing is more of an issue for the elite peeveepee’ers who want to gank VNIs instead of fight.
---
I suspect they want to give omega accounts an advantage for heavy trading.  That also somewhat helps to deal with market bots.
---
You completely misunderstood this thread.
---
Not everything needs to be personal.
---
I thought it would be the best method to kill market bots. There are some flaws with this approach as some others pointed out.
---
You think mining doesn’t have a direct counterpart to people who hunt only miners and ratters?  How can you write an entire fucking book for a post but be incapable of thinking about replies?
---
stuff of dreams right there.. rip loot, think i have only got the super bling implant (that only drops in wh) 2-3 times in the 3-4(?) years ghostsites been out
---
Scroll through posts about local chat in nullsec for the past two years.
---
This wont act deflationary. People try to adapt irl economics to Eve economics but forget the financial sector aspect. The moneybase in Eve is latent and you can always grind. So you can reduce away but people wont hurt from it which means deflation wont arise. Ofc more complicated but you get the point, deflation occurs when demand falls which it wont since the inflation wont actually discourage people from buying.
---
Why did they unsubscribe do you think?  It’s a permanent loss cycle to cater to short term griefers instead of people who want to actually play the game long term (pvp and pve alike)

Ehh if you wanna upgrade the hull for the purpose of missions, just get a golem, or a rattlesnake.

Not sure if the difference in cost would be worth it for Scorp navy or Raven navy.
---
EVE is a sandbox game, ok??? Use your imagination. Fleets of asteroids are threatening all of New Eden! Fleets of herioc mining ships fight them!
---
I can feel a delivery on its way
---
Maybe not the entire fee but perhaps .25-1% of the total value. That way re-prices only make sense if the price change is at least over .5%.
---
This has the effect of making the market overall faster, since it makes each individual price step in the undercutting war bigger.
---

Dont want to check that myself becouse its too expensive, but just for science... would sub1s hekate also explode if i wanted to warp away from can during hack?

im down in delve, carrou is quite the roadtrip away but i dont think i ever got kills in it anyway. i was tackling for larger ships that got the final blows.

Can medium rails and beam lasers please go back to being hot garbage? It's been how many years of this ferox bullshit already? And I thought the HM drake era was aids.
---
its going to sisi tomorrow, and tq later this summer,. this change is not a gamechanger, so dont see why you whine about it when they give a few days/weeks of notice before making it live
---
Yeah capital skins usually go for allmost as much as the hull of the ship.
---
big gay
---
&gt; Oh, you got undercut? Well that's too bad, unless you want to lose an enormous amount of isk, you're stick until the next order finishes.
---
So have some spare stock on hand and undercut them back, they'll also have to eat some losses if they want to undercut you. This makes pricing changes actually meaningful rather than being a .1 isk war to see whose items show up at the top when buyers sort by price.
---
Can you back up the "grr fuck you" a bit? Perhaps explain your viewpoint of how changing mining to cause people to spread out to naturally be a "grr we hate miners and ratters" with the understanding that the idea of spreading people out is to reduce global super capital coverage.
---
As an Illinoisan this hits far to close to home.

This is fine. Makes the barrier for entry for market PvP a little higher.

Can confirm.
---
so don't shop at TTT, nobody's forcing you to.
---
Can anyone elaborate on what factors into this: "Increased total minimum taxation on NPC structures from 3% to 5.25%."?
---
The Rattlesnake is another hull I could consider. Is there any reason it's a notably better choice? It seems like it would have pretty poor application against small targets.
---
democracy sucks.   its 2 wolf 1 sheep.  
---
Caldari hate being the sheep, the minority, the side with no voice.  and no option other than to do what the Gallente(the largest population wise) want   so Caldari want some colonies. they wont get them as they not the majority. and the majority want the colonies for themselves.
---
so caldari left.  to create their own state where, while not perfect,  theres a bit more control instead of tyrany of majority. 
---
the Caldari state still has democracy in it, between the megacorps.  but it also has the central state itself, providing some control and saftey from the majority, for the minority.  (think of a constitutional republic.  though in the caldari's situation...the republic is extremely limited on the individual level, in favor of a meritocracy.   this has major issues on its own, as seen in the Caldari prior to tibus heth's rise, back when CEOs had more control of their workers and didn't care about their lives.   post-heth, the central state forces some responsibility for worker lives so they can't use the equivolent of asbestos in work places or homes)
---
its not perfect. not by a long shot, and has issues it didnt have under the gallente.  but its a step above direct democracy the gallente have.  
---
Gallente didn't like the caldari leaving(specially as the amarr pose a large threat to gallente later on. not a good time to show disunity),  and liked the fact Caldari were holding Caldari prime under their own control even less.  as its a soverign planet inside gallente's capital system. (even more when you consider how insanely large Gallente Prime and Caldari Prime are for planets.  which means its an extremely large vulnerability for the gallente, in addition to some of the largest livable planets)
---
Barghest or scorp is probably what you want
---
And my sarcasm didn't even get an updoot. #upvoteforscience
---
eve dont know what better - this amazing drop or music, snuff like always make good content!
---
For all intents and purposes, as far as missions are concerned, it’s a Raven with much better drones.
---
If you are worried about application, you can sacrifice some of the tank for a target painter/web, or keep a flight of small/medium drones in the rattle as well. Additionally if you wanna spend a little bit of isk geckos apply quite nicely also.
---
The Barghest is an interesting one. I love the design of the ship. How would you suggest using it for this use case?
---
Ok, that explains where we are disagreeing - I don't see any problem with people not being able to catch up directly.
---
- read title
---
- panic
---
- see url
---
- be ok
---
The "problem" is the same as with joining eve earlier and in my eyes not an issue at all.
---
if you need to fill it then there it does not :/
---
Why Amarr not Min?
---
Jason baros was a tit. As per my in game bio
---
Also, what's up Menaiya.
---
They were kind of dying in darkness. What was left  of them went down to etherium reach to be put to sleep by unspoken alliance.
---
Here's my drastic counter-proposal.
---
You can not put up more than a small amount (5?) of sell orders in Highsec NPC stations unless you have a corp office or a "personal office", which then increased the number of sell orders that you can put up. The number of office slots is greatly increased.
---
At the end of every month, there is a blind auction on corp offices/personal offices. Top x corps/people get a slot, if you lose your slot your sell orders are cancelled if the number goes over the max.
---
If you want to sell stuff in Jita 4-4, you have to pay more for the prime real storefront.
---
I'd like to subscribe to your blog or newsletter.
---
Seriously though I'd like to learn more about this kind of stuff but have no idea where to start, especially for UK stuff.
---
That's how market in albion online works. They have fully player made economy system and market with 2% sale tax and 1% setup fee.
---
Sale tax applies when you sell an item.
---
Setup fee applies whenever you create or update a buy or sell order.
---
Player's there quickly learned how to operate under such conditions. For example if there is an item with 7% overall profit on your flip and there is someone undercutting you you need to reconsider if you wanna undercut him back. After only 4 undercuts of each other you are both no longer making any profits and just fighting each other increasing your losses. Sometimes it is just better to just wait till the guy above you sells his stuff first. Or you can go into full scale trade war, take the temporarily loss and push the fucker out of your market.
---
From what I could tell there is almost no market bots there. As under such conditions human players will always outsmart them.
---
It won't redbutton anything, the spread will just increase to cover the extra loss.
---
Unregulated 'free' market results in cartel of all major players shocker
---
Instead of changing the brokerage fee, what if there was simply a cap on the number of times an order could be modified? Something like 3 times a day.
---
join all-out
---
At least based on sec status. CONCORD does a huge amount to protect these structures, and yet charges nothing for the privilege.
---
OMFG! IT's a fucking trick. They just want us to come back to baby sit and do endless grind ops!
---
Recently sold the triglavian skins we got at EVEsterdam, at least one sold for 5b
---
That's another option, however the advantage of "wider" brokerage fee is that it creates another isk sink for people involved in market pvp.
---
This would be a motivator to fight them then.
---
It will have reduced and probably quite a lot, look at all the nullblobbers complaining about how they can't undock any more.
---
are you actually saying hitler was good?
---
I basically didn't sleep for a week when I started it. It's addictive.
---
Just like blackout is forcing people to quit eve?  They seem to want people to take more risks.  And despite this change they want to change the wealth disparity, so something along those lines seems in the realm of possible.
---
&gt; Brokerage fees are calculated relative to the total value of the item sold
---
Yeah but if your margin is 200% then who cares about 5% or 3%. If you're selling at a nominal markup of 5% then that change is the entirety of your real margin.
---
Get a rattlesnake if you have to fly faction, pretty close the same hull cost with much higher DPS output. Neither Raven NI nor Scorpion NI have higher DPS output in comparison to a Raven. Decent PVP ships though. However it is not a sniper raven, instead you work from 0 to 100 km with sentries or heavies and you don't keep a distance in order to avoid dmg in comparison to Sniper Raven, which simply stays out of npc damage range. Simply said rattle is a brick-tank, you don't move and you take the beating...
---
Barghest sits in between rattle and raven, however the hull cost to tank value is an invite to gank you. However Sniper Barghest is an significant upgrade from Sniper Raven also an upgrade from Sniper Raven NI distance wise.
---
This is effectively a 2% across the board nerf to WH income yes. I bet CCP didn't even consider J space when coming up with this idea.
---
This is a warning?   It's going live on SISI tomorrow.

Exploration can definitely be worth your while, especially if you're a new pilot. You don't need anything bigger than a frigate to do most data/relic sites. Sansha relic sites in nullsec are particularly lucrative. Intact Armor Plates are the big money drop, they sell for 6-7m each and I've seen as many as 15 in a single can. Exact income will depend a lot on RNG, obviously, but averaged over time I'd guess it's ~75m ISK/hr.  Disclaimer, being in a nullsec alliance with sovereignty in Sansha rat territory would this easier/safer. On the flip side, one decent stack of plates (10-ish) is enough to pay for at least one exploration fitted Astero, or probably a whole pile of T1 racial frigates with an exploration fit.

No kidding. My second thought after seeing this was to check if it came from EVE Onion, with my *first* thought being "Oh shit."
---
Not at all. I said He was Great.
---
Wooden doors, bruh...wooden fucking doors.
---
Did you actually think that idea out before you posted it or are you just being semantic because you have no experience with it?
---
Are you suggesting that you split your stack; put up 100 spod at 2 isk just so you can undercut the person who undercut you with a completely different stack of 100 spod at 1.98? So now you're not just playing market PvP with someone else at a higher price, you're playing market PvP with yourself by tying up your own assets in two different orders at two different prices while you wait 89 days and 23 hours for your order to expire?
---
It's already a carpal tunnel inducing asspain as it is. Worst case scenario, this change is taken seriously and instead of having a couple dozen buy/sell orders for any given thing, we'll have a fucking million as people are buying minerals one or two at a time because that'll actually be more efficient than paying an order-total percentage to modify.

If you are already selling in GW, Boystin selling shield extenders with a Jita cost of 9.4k for 50k, then this change will make you lose 2% of 50k or 1k per sale. Moving to Jita on the other hand will cost you 41.6k per sale.

And that's fine when you don't consider that EVE's playerbase is made up entirely of Autistic spreadsheet warriors who, when measured and compared, don't even show up on the same disability spectrum because the center of the bell-curve is so much farther away.

What's next? Comparing EVE's economy to that of your modded Minecraft server's market mod?

What a terrible argument.

Its the blue doughnut hole.  Nullsec already blued each other, now they’re bluing each other in empire space as well.

Concord also authorizes attacks on them and forbids certain weapons being used. Not that it's a good excuse just more pieces of info.
---
Except for SRP, of course.    That's the **good** socialism.
---
No, what I am proposing is to punish people who use 5 systems of the 150+ that they own. They aren't using their space if 90% of their actions(ratting/industry/mining/etc) are within a few systems. Upwell structures allow you to condense into smaller space than before. Show me a single alliance that uses all of its space and has a fairly even spread of ratting.
---
Why would you do this to us fam? You had me really going till I could see the rest of the title. Well played.
---
Gas mining. A venture can do it, a prospect can do it and fit a cloak. Gas sites in c4-6 WHs can be hugely profitable, research the different types of gas prices (on fuzzworks or such) so you know what to go for.

Corp took a few bombers into TEST space. Came out with 10+ bil in kills in two hours. This sounds great and all but I doubt it was so great for the guy we bombed into oblivion. Not even a buffer tanked Rattlesnake could last long enough to even yelp. I'm not saying things were fine before. But what we have now is a null sec ratter can not see what's coming. Can not run from what's coming. Can not fight what's coming. And has to be on guard every second. On the other side of the same coin. The camper can observe without being observed. Can disengage safely. And is entirely prepared to 'fight' PvE ships. In other words. Drop bombs and warp off. And can leave and return to his computer at his own leisure. It is extremely risky to rat in anything less than a capital and comparatively not very rewarding. It is extremely safe now to be a cloaky roamer. And very rewarding. And yet people don't like people parking alt eyes on gates. They want zkill gone. They want all map data gone. One would have to be incredibly stubborn to not admit how unfair this is. It's fun, I get it. But it's not healthy for the game. I disagree with Blackout. Maybe it can be a good thing. But they certainly need to reconsider a lot of other things if it's here for keeps. Remove anoms and bring missions to null sec or something I don't know. So people at least have a chance to spot something decloaking on the acceleration gate. I'm not a game designer but I doubt such simple solutions can ever fix the mess CCP has created. Perhaps everything need to be reworked from the ground up who knows.
---
Yep we have filled hundreds of location orders usually within a week or so
---
no it isnt
---
The logic of moving them out and only in nullsec is for the specific purpose of making it easier to kill them.  It provides NO other benefit to anyone on either side.  Literally.  “Buh supercap umbrella”. yeah.  It’ll become “buh why is null dead every alliance is blue wtf” because there won’t be a benefit to giving a damn  about space any more or sov or borders.
---
Hisec would still have concord, lowsec would still have local, wormholes still have controlled entrances, 
---
Nullsec would have nothing but a roaming mega blue donut that would kill the game harder than it already has been by ideas that enforce blue donuts like this.

Give it time. Eve is a game played in years, not weeks or months.
---
The spod's mating call is tough to resist.
---
Well, yea.. the idea is indeed to spread out the mega shield. It's also the idea to reduce influx of minerals. Those are the two salient points of the idea.

How about they add Dust, merge the games, then add Killing in Stations to go hunt those bots down in the hallways of Jita 4-4

---
A Raptor can tank it easily
---
Yeah I guess I know. It's a complicated problem and simple solutions aren't going to solve much. Maybe one of the problems is that null sec is essentially the end game in a way. Where everybody wants to go to make the most money and fly the biggest ships. If high sec, low sec and WH space were just as compelling as alternative gameplay rather than mere stepping stones. Convince people they want to stay in high sec rather than joining the biggest null sec bloc. Fuck knows how you even begin to approach that. This increased interaction between players and NPCs they were talking about could be something though.
---
There already is a 1% (at max skills) NPC sales tax for citadels, and that is being raised to 2.25% as well, according to the dev blog.
---
Minimum broker fees are now 3%, minimum sales tax is now 2.25%.  Broker fees are determined by station (or trading keepstar) sales tax is universal.
---
NO TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION!
---
Better have a bandaid than a gaping wound.
---
unironically biomass in real life
---
&gt; It's all cool, but changing all those things will just shift flavour of the game towards something else, at which point having more of that flavour manned by more people will still dominate territorial wars.
---
How long have you *actually* been playing EVE? I've been around since 2004. We actually did have far more small to mid-sized content for a long time, at least until the current situation which is the culmination of changes made since Fozzie. EVE is quite different than it used to be, and if you're happy with its state now, there's point in arguing with you. It can be changed again, and it *needs* to be, imo.
---
Maybe I'm pessimistic, but this is what I'm seeing...
---
* Blackout: drives all non-aligned null-sec groups into the blue doughnut for protection.
---
* NPC market tax rise: drives marketeers to trade in blue doughnut owned high-sec citadels.
---
So far CCP's chaos strategy seems to be working out fantastic for doughnut. I wonder what's next. Ban on sub-cap ratting? Removal of non-capital mining vessels? Excavator evading bomb damage? Who knows. - In any case, CCP's vision of the future is sure looking doughnut shaped.
---
what program do you use for multiboxing?
---
Goons initially tried a libertarian/free market approach. It didn't work. Now we're a socialist dictatorship and the most powerful group in the game. I'm not sure what that means, other than it is what happened.

The nullsec sites only spawn easy and medium cans, so with a T2 hacking mod you have a fair chance of succeeding even in a ceptor.
---
Holy shit lol.. this one got me

back when Chimera looked like a ship that would command a fleet.
---
Honestly, i prefer more the concept of "seasons" as it is implemented in Albion Online, accumulate "challenge points" for doing several different kinds of activities and unlock  chests for the season.
---
In my opinion 4 seasons a year (3month long) would be perfect, do whatever floats your boat but that requires "interacting" with the enviroment or other players and you are set, mining, pvping, pveing, salvaging, fw, sov contesting.
---
EVE old ?
---
EVE is barely a teenager
---
Computer gaming started around 1960 . during 70s remained barely noticeable and then 80s came and changed everything where we have the establishment of the computer gaming industry. 
---
It took another 3 decades for EVE online to be released, the game is only 11 years old. Even as a MMORG EVE appeared a decade after the first true MMORGs with emphasis on the first M, Massive. 
---
So no EVE is not old , plus "old" is barely relevant for MMORGs that are constantly updated with new mechanics , graphics, music , sound to the extend that you end up with a new game. 
---
EVE like most MMORGs comes with a steep learning curve, it had the steepest so far for me but after diving deep into WARFRAME it blows EVE out of the water in terms of level of customization depth etc. EVE is also not far from other sci fi games , I can speak for ELITE DANGEROUS which also has a very steep learning curve. 
---
So these type of games what I call "hardcore" MMORGS are difficult to get started and even to stick around. But then there is the appeal, steep learing curve also means tons of choices, less chance to get bored and even if you are you can always come back to the game , again and again. 
---
There is nothing special about learning EVE compared to other hardcore MMORGs , wiki and youtube is your friend as well as throwing logic out of the window because when it comes to hardcore MMORGs  rarely things make sense by just playing the game. But then like the steep learning curve that's part of the appeal. 
---
Whether EVE is your cup of teas you can find only by playing the game. Like all hardcore MMORGs you will need around a month at least of playing , or 30 hours of pure game time as these games are designed to be played literally for thousands of hours. 
---
Of course my use of "hardcore" is not imply that the game is trully hard, it can be if you try to learn very fast , but if you take your time it can be as relaxing as any other game. 
---
Contrary to the hype EVE is not a PVP game. The PVP part is completely optional and very easy to avoid. So don't late people scare you away about how "brutal" the game is. It can be but only if you allow to be, I did allow it when I first started but then as soon as I discovered that PVP experience was meehhh but PVE which is 90% of the game content was very good I stuck around and mostly avoided PVE eventhough my initial goal was to play for the "great" PVP experience it was hyped about. 
---
Other's seem to love the PVP part of the game and be very satisfied with it level of customization and overall gameplay. 
---
EVE ways of playing are typical of a hardcore MMORG
---
1) The Butcher (PVP) - "EVE is a PVP game, git gud, or go back to WOW noob"
---
2) The Explorer - "wow what is that in the corner ? Ah its so beautiful.. wait... Aaaa AAAAAAAHHH!!!!"
---
3) The Exterminator (PVE) - "Die Die NPCs and give me all your loot"
---
4) The Farmer (Miner and Ratting)- "The grind is my way,  bot is my name"
---
5) The Guilder (Corp) - "Best ship is friendship, look how many friends I have, muhahaha, oh oh a spy.."
---
6)  The scientist (Industry) - Knowledge is the only true power
---
7) The trader (trading) - "No money no honey boy. What you made a billion isk ? how cute..."
---
8) The teacher (youtube, wiki, in game help) - "Let me enlighten you my child with my true wisdom "
---
9)  The Han Soloer - "I don't have time for this shit"
---
10) The Dreamer - "I used to play a lot of EVE but took a meteorite to the knee ... EVE is dead without me anyway"
---
11) The storyteller - "Welcome to my blog, let me tell you about the origins of New Eden"
---
12) The scammer - "Wait I can scam people legally in this game as I did with all the other games illegally, awesome !!!! EVE is the best game in the world".
---
And like all other hardcore MMORGS you can combine those roles in multiple ways.
---
So.  They grind adms and spend 10s of trillions to set up a space, to get punished and forced to become what pandemic legion used to be.
---
Roaming cancer that kills everything it comes across?
---
All while people can dock forever in safety of npc null and cloak forever in one system and go to jita every time for what they need or mission run from the same locations.
---
I don’t get why you hate nullsec, you don’t HAVE to play in null if you absolutely hate it.  Begging for blanket nerfs to fuck over everyone who does play in nullsec is akin to me saying “ccp please ban sharnhorstdw because i don’t like how he plays”
---
Even though i’ve never met you.  It’s a ridiculous stance

That really is a crazy coincidence this came about at the same time heh.

Its a good thing I sold 2k plex last night, not getting me today taxes!

I don't even play the game anymore and this gave me a heart attack!
---
This is the opposite of new player friendly. Veterans already trained those important skills / have the time to do so.. new players won't have the time to skill trade skills since they have so much other important skills like the magic 14 to train.

Not true. You should read up on the price elasticity of demand. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price\_elasticity\_of\_demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_elasticity_of_demand)

LITERALLY UNPLAYABLE CCP
---
Silly answer: It means that the Talocan were apparently fans of ancient cinema. (Ancient for *them* at least.)
---
Serious answer: Nobody outside the folks who have actually worked on EVE knows with any certainty. Maybe it's just a shout-out to 2001: A Space Odyssey, or perhaps it's something more, but CCP isn't telling. There's a lot of stuff like that in New Eden, such as the [floating stonehenges](http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id=10269) you'll occasionally find in deadspace sites, along with the [Mysterious Shuttle](https://evetravel.wordpress.com/2011/03/26/mysterious-shuttle/) in Geztic and the [Mysterious Probe](https://evetravel.wordpress.com/2011/09/10/mysterious-beacon/) in Charmerout, both of which may or may not have been related to the [Awakened Infomorph](http://wiki.eve-inspiracy.com/index.php?title=Awakened_Infomorph) in some way.
---
Then there was the [Terminus Stream](https://evetravel.wordpress.com/2012/04/15/terminus-stream/) in Vuorassi, which is probably never going to be explained because it disappeared from the game when the Crucible expansion was released. Apparently this was due to some players - in typical EVE fashion - deciding to exploit its lethal properties for their own gain and [tricked an entire fleet into warping on top of it](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/4xoe9r/video_old_2min_video_of_ganked_night_vs_the/d6h35qv/).
---
So many tantalizing mysteries in New Eden, so little time for the devs to work on them. I hope we'll learn the answers to them one day.
---
That banker looks strangely familiar
---
Rr leshak and rep legion use cita to do ewar gg
---
Nobody that can form the numbers isn't in the nip and game mechanics where changed by the NS CSM to prevent repeated wardecs against larger groups, i mean the only really way to deal with this is to have months of boring game play and this might be a shock but most people outside of nullsec don't particular like to do that.

You can't spell CCCP without CCP.
---
Concord wants to increase the defense budget.  Take it up with them.
---
Exactly what i thought ... it fits so perfectly :D
---
So there is too much injecting into caps that farm in zero risk null because too many caps to protect them. Clearly the solution is not to fix the faucets.
---
I'm not sure that's true in Amar space.

Conflict of interest. You want to play with people who don't play with you. But you're also so short on options that you don't have too many other options. Krabs would rather roamers were gone entirely. Roamers seem to be pretty happy with how defenceless some krabs are now. Corp took some bombers out the other day and killed 10+ bil in shit in about two hours or something. Took like no effort and virtually nothing was at risk. Both of these extremes are really unhealthy for the game. Personally I think that kind of content belongs in wormholes. WHs should definitely be making more money than null sec flat out. WH dwellers inherently would be more willing to fight back. Their hole isn't infinitely accessible like a null sec system is you actually have to have a look inside to guess what might be there. A little more adventurous for you blokes. More likely to get a balanced fight. A little more spoopy for the krabs but they potentially make more money given the risk. And their man cave has to actually be found and isn't immediately accessible to everyone who wants to kill an Ishtar. Seems like the perfect compromise honestly. Whatever solution CCP comes up with, all sides not to be moderately happy. I'm not a wormholer so I don't know why WHs are so dead so I can't even begin to propose how to fix it. But I know that null sec is broken as fuck so perhaps promoting content in the regions where content is dead would be easier than promoting it in a place that is already volatile and we don't even know how to fix.
---
Damn almost thought eve was getting better. Instead he's still around and ccp posts facebook ads saying rorques are used in fleet battles lmao.
---
Check my flair? It's not bait. I live in Querious and Fountain. Check my post history. I'm pretty moderate. Your response feels pretty knee jerk. Like, did you personally spend 50 trillion? Is there some major reason that personally impacts you that explains why you don't want some mega empire to need two regions instead of one? What's personally on the line for you?

The PvP I choose to participate in I don't even have to log in for and causes more deaths than you could dream.

&gt;we see vast sums of taxes poured into collapsing services like schools and healthcare without so much as a meagre improvement in services
---
Actually, statistics say we don't.  But talking points say we do.
---
Also, you have to keep in mind this particular thought process has been used to inject "the magic of the free market" into these areas, resulting in private entities siphoning off cash while not improving anything.
---
Still does nothing to tax the market manipulations, and market scams, which only count on creating orders, not fulfilling them.
---
At least before citadels, they paid tax on that.
---
I have a feeling blackout has delayed things. Don't worry I'm sure they will get to you eventually. It seems they do not forgive or forget, you could ask around about how forgetful/forgiving they are.

"Increase the minimum taxation on player owned structures by 125%"

Drastically increased risk for an increased PVE/Hr income in wormholes sounds like a dream come true. Increased wanderer frequency spawns and more connectivity would increase the risk, then buff the sites.

So looking at the prices, yes they did go up. (Could be from blackout?)

The only BPO research/copying worth a damn will take you 2 years to get those BPOs to sellable levels. Then the copying takes days/weeks.

Station trading or incursions or BS ratting in Null. attainable 500m per week with relatively little investment in time or blingy shit.

Eha and Oicx are GMVA, GoG and GFSL with help from WANGS here and there for bashes because they're chill as fuck and still GalMil at heart. We hate bots too. 
---
The warzone flipped when the GalMil LP value tanked and there was no content because it was one sided. So we stopped deplexing and shit got captured. Deplexing fucking blows. We can hold Vlillirier, Oicx, and Eha because we're busting our asses to keep them. 
---
Props to RvB, The Russia, PAAN, Templis and the rest for awesome fights recently. Sorry about the cancer last night, but that's kinda just what happens when you bring Tornados to a Mach fight. GF.
---
Then again new players usually don't have the trade volume to feel the impact of this.
---
Probably not dead per se but judging by the amount of free stuff CCP is giving to entice existing omega players like me to come back is kinda funny. 
---
Of course the main reason why I mostly left was not just the blackout, usual burnout, I am sure I will be back but this time as an Alpha. For now I log in maybe once every 3 days if I remember, to refresh my PI commands. 
---
I mean null sec is not known for its activity anyway by CCP admition (like 70% or something) the vast majority of it is completely devoid of players and that was way before the blackout. 
---
The millage varies depending where you are , to be fair I was already located in an area of null sec that was not that active , obviously in places where big alliances live your experience may be the polar opposite. But again neither my experience or someone else experience come close to represent the vast majority of null systems that they see life only from free roaming relic hunters and free roaming gank fleets just passing through desperately seeking for easy targets. Unfortunately that also means that you are far from everything which is why all these systems are empty in the first place. 
---
So if you come to null for the action, you are drunk, head back to High sec. 
---
As far my alliance is concerned it seems took a 50% hit , so still obviously far from dead but it ain't looking pretty either. 
---
For PVPers though I can see the appeal of the blackout , especially for soloers and small gank fleets. 
---
But I think it safe bet to claim even for populated systems , "Dockup Online" is alive and kicking so far :D
---
yes, moon ORE doesn't. Moons break in high sec, but its just asteroids.
---
Your wormhole have any effects? Or just vanilla?

Ah. The stereotypical anti-Semitism is about as blatant as anything I've ever seen.
---
I feel like FEDUP gave it pretty good given how outshipped they were on this one. The neutral warpin was honestly questionably necessary given how free it is to combat probe shield feroxes. Nice to see a good fight go down.

Sales taxes are flat across the board. Upsell structures don't have reduced sales taxes.

But then they remove asset safety and something something chaos

I hear Goonswarm has jumped in fleets of combat-fitted Rorquals just for the sheer WTF value they possess. Apparently just blowing up the other side isn't enough for Goons; their opponents need to die in utter bewilderment.

Damps are just as bad :P yes you can lock them but only if they are within 1km. 
---
If I decide to stay thats probably what il do.
---
It isn't reduced by any more than it was before.
---
This change does nothing in that regard.
---
I see what you’re saying, but I think blackout just opened people’s eyes to how empty nullsec REALLY is. Blackout isn’t the problem, the “Muh ticks” culture is. Undock something and come fight.
---
That said, the whole camping a VNI etc for hours thing is ridiculous. Personally, it’s extremely unsatisfying for me to kill a ship that cannot reasonably fight back. I WILL hunt pve ships if I’m extremely bored and the locals refuse to undock pvp ships. But lately they just take this “If we give you content, you’ll come back” mentality. If you give me a fight, I’ll give you a “gf” and move on to the next fight or go home/reship for a new roam etc.

The way I see thing, I’m doing you a favor by traveling all the way to YOUR space, bringing content to your doorstep. When we typically have to spend hours or days looking for that very thing.
---
I'll do that, thank you for replying.
---
But then you don't have tackle.
---
Lol
---
Yeah, CCP made a mistake with the jam nerf. It went too far in the other direction.
---
it is not the issue of instawarp it's the issue of a tank...If I recall right something with 18k dmg tank and more should be able to survive a failed hack...but the npc are as hard as a rattlesnake so resistance is futile.
---
Need more.
---
o7
---
Potentially, just taken to much much much much more drastic positions
---
Damps are turbo aids yeah. Used well they can really ruin a smallgang fight.
---
I noticed the FOB in agency said "Unavailable" Does that mean it is being changed or something or there are just none around?
---
Yes....Yes....Anger will lead you to the dark force....Yes!!
---
&gt; NPC market tax rise: drives marketeers to trade in blue doughnut owned **high-sec citadels.**
---
I honestly wonder if it's even *possible* to make EVE less obtuse and opaque without diminishing functionality. It would certainly be nice...
---
ECM was super broken in micro gang and solo stuff.
---
And I say that as a Widow pilot.
---
Being able to jump in and keep my target permajammed was broken.
---
It was fun, but definitely broken.
---
ECM was never all that strong in larger fleet battles. Wormhole fights we're about the largest you could do and have ECM be worthwhile, but it still wasn't super powerful.
---
Good fight. Wardec mechanics being broken meant we also had repping issues with allies.
---
I was able to tackle multiple Gilas during the mentioned warp-offs.
---
The prologue about us being miffed does leave out the use of mutual allies to get on ACLs and use our structures to repair after killing ratters though :P
---
And then defend them from the donut?
---
&gt;the Caldari state still has democracy in it, between the megacorps.  but it also has the central state itself, providing some control and saftey from the majority, for the minority.
---
Lore doesn't really support this.  If you aren't working for one of the megacorps, you are effectively an "un-person".  The state has instituted some safety regulations, but they are only to care for the workers.  Nothing is done for those who were tossed aside.
---
500M isk is more like a week worth of gametime, not half a month ;)
---
You need to acquaint yourself with the saying "lies, damned lies, and statistics".
---
Take this fight as an example: https://zkillboard.com/related/30004789/201907291800/
---
From a statistical point of view, fully 12.5% of the Goonswarm fleet comp in that fight were Rorquals.
---
someone joining in 2019 is vastly behind on SP to someone who started in 2003. That's not taken to more drastic positions. Someone who started in 2003 could have very nearly, if not, all skills trained to 5.
---
I used to be as excited as you, wanted to create my own missions because I was bombared by claims of "EVE is all about player content" then I discovered how annoying it was to generate any real player content and gave up and start reading the wiki and enjoyed the game by just avoiding the hype and understand the game's true limitations. It was fun from there on. 
---
I wish you all the luck in the world for your ambitious goals, you gonna need it....
---
VNI changes. Alpha drone skill changes
---
"Raise taxes, because that always solves the problem!"
---
P much, yeah.
---
True, and I do address this in the pre and post heth.
---
Plus where I mention the meritocracy
---
I think this was primarily for T2 production. Doing this in a POS was a nightmare. It is much improved with citadels now.
---
Ah gotcha.
---
lol thanks....totally will use...
---
I figure that the alien ships will have some more exotic designs, those'll be nice. EVE really is the reigning champ of creative ship designs, though.
---
IIRC, If you can make T2/T3 ships, you will have learned pretty much all the science skills you need to make the components for those ships.
---
So, the "extra" skills would be reactions....which if you can make T2/T3 ships means training only Reactions V and Advanced Reactions IV.
---
And in terms of market taxes, that's only saving the difference in the taxes between the raw moongoo and the final moongoo.
---
(T2 modules and ammo have a smaller skill requirement for manufacturing, so your mileage may vary)
---
Which is true - if they didn't have a panic module there would not be a "massive fleet fight", there would just be a one-sided slaughter.
---
The panic module is a cancer upon this game.
---
Optionally, yes.
---
I'm sure that hiseccers will provide an example of this adapting and surviving that they've been crowing about since the drifter attacks started.
---
I almost lost it, glad I opened notification.
---
This still works in small comps and gate camping pretty well. But yes, solo pilots need to find a new comp because it was pretty broken before.
---
Words are hard for him. \^
---
I think he meant the whole module meta levels thing (and different subclasses of ships like combat bc's vs attacc bc's)
---
It's not a troll. Lies, damned lies and statistics.
---
As I replied to another comment: 
---
&gt;Take this fight as an example: https://zkillboard.com/related/30004789/201907291800/
---
&gt;From a purely statistical point of view, over 12.5% of the Goonswarm fleet comp in that fight were Rorquals, and they made up a sliver over 9% of all ships involved in the fight.
---
&gt;It's what happens when you look purely at numbers without ever examining the context.
---
You've never seen a battlerorq?
---
&gt;destribution
---
Is this the shorthand for distribution of destruction?
---
You might not play so dirty but plenty of other people will. Give people the avenue to abuse mechanics and it will be abused to all hell. Neither you or I can control that. Neither you or I can make people want to undock for you. If the problem is child one doesn't want to play child two but child two wants to play with child one. Then he needs somebody he CAN play with. Roamers don't have anywhere else to go I get that. It sucks I know. So we need to find you guys some new peeps to play with. That or the krabs are proportionally rewarded for the risk they now have to put up with. An anom ratter literally can't do anything to prevent being farmed right now. When your sand castle is constantly kicked over by the "fuck krabs" guys and it's completely out of their control unless they're in a supercarrier. It's the same feeling as being blobbed. You either give up on looking for a decent fight or you keep beating your head against the wall until hoping something finally goes your way. Some weird guys like spreadsheets but you can't make them like what you like can you. Doesn't mean they should be kicked from the game.
---
Most trigshit is
---
So first of all look at how will target you and for what reasons.
---
Read the following guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/8yye3r/wormhole_eviction_survival_guide_for_beginners/
---
Now a lot of your comp is gonna be dictated what your up against and in what number along with the experience of your dudes and what your FC's are most convertible flying, because in the end executing you battle plan is gonna matter. 
---
Get an idea what your dudes skills are what effects do you have how much money are you willing to have stuck in home defense, what is your likely attacker etc etc.
---
That's what she said.
---
Why 2% and not more? Cause its a 3% tax raise and a 2% brokers fee raise right? Wont it be more?
---
And how much is that in absolute terms, pure isk wise? I dunno how much an average person in WHs make.
---
Combat rorquals are pretty common actually. However, they are not fit with a Panic module because they can’t activate that without having an asteroid locked
---
&gt;So far CCP's chaos strategy seems to be working out fantastic for doughnut. I wonder what's next.
---
Anomaly nerfs to "spread out" the ratters.
---
....which will be followed by the blocs just taking more space and having a standing fleet per region.  Meanwhile a "small" group that was trying to live in a constellation will suddenly find itself needing a region, but be unable to actually take and hold it.  Resulting in even more people moving to the blocs.
---
The giant flaw in these "make Eve dangerous!!!" design choices is the easiest way to mitigate that danger is to join a giant group, and there's no way to make life in those giant groups more dangerous than in small groups.
---
It's the same change as NPC stations. I'm not sure why they represented it two different ways.
---
1% to 2.25% = 125% increase
---
I'm so disappointed this isnt real
---
But that would be on a tiny handful of characters before.
---
With injectors suddenly that difference is infinite.
---
That's the big issue.
---
The stations have their tax rate in their name. It is very hard to miss
---

Use the sentries and guns as separate weapon systems unless bs.  I’ll split the blasters into two groups and you can one shot npc frigs with each group.   It’s about as active as missioning can be, but it’s kinda fun.  I always prefer the pve In eve to be engaging. It’s mostly boring because people go about it so passively.  
---
Most fun verses sepentis and other kin/therm baddies
---
&gt;ECM was super broken in micro gang and solo stuff.
---
now ECM is just broken
---
There are no valuable moons in HS. It's a war on the economy. Maybe we'll go burn down some citadels just for funsies but meh. Economic wars are often slow but measurable in time.
---
I mean the Zealot got a drone bay.. what else do you need?
---
Heavy armor, or basi Gila. Additionally, make WH friends.   
---
Other WH groups will help defend if you are active and willing to give fights when people roll into you.
---
It's funny that Monopoly (or The Landlord Game) was designed to teach people how great socialist ideologies are.
---
What it really did was teach everyone that taxation is theft.
---
Which genius dev made the Nightmare and went, yep, this shit armor tanks.
---
Fine! I'll add it!
---
That only helps if the new development team is significantly better than the old development team.
---
Otherwise you just end up with different "#ccp #gamemechanics #corecode" problems.
---
Rorq with bulkheads and trimarks = insane ehp, fitted with cap neut and heavy scram = get hard tackle n butt fucked! Cost for battle rorq &lt; dread. 
---
Dont see how CCP is bad at statistics, seems more like OP lacks the understanding battle Rorq.
---
no there's always plenty room to grow, it's more or less the same as jita in comparison to 0,01 isk battle with significant less competition. However any faction ammo (republic fleet, imperial navy, federation navy) is always kinda in shortage, you can also get into other modules, I started with command centers, then added meta(meta 1 to 4) equipment, and then went to faction and deadspace, later on into implants, basic / standard/ hardwireings. I still do it and I still recommend it, passive income through market 24/7. Once a week resupply run \~4 hrs. At some point u have a stock lying around.
---
They mentioned at EVE North that local reps would this summer
---
Cheers, and nice job FCing that fight.
---
That's not anything close to a "compensating change". Things that would run Slaves on a regular basis are not engaged in situations where the shield recharge rate matters.
---
Yes I've flown them but going with this static lol
---
It's a game world with quadrillions of people, many of which are unfathomably wealthy.
---
The answer to every "Do you think capsuleers ever..." question is yes.  Because there will be at least one doing it.
---
Ahhh, ya the meta levels. I mean, it's a little easier with comparison chart revamp, but I can definitely see this still looking like a foreign language to newer pilots.
---
Nice tackling. :-)
---
+10000
---
CCP has said the difficulty with citadel SKINs is establishing who owns them and when they can be used. Since the SKIN isn't attached to a particular pilot they'd have to modify or rewrite the SKIN system.
---
Personally, I've always thought a good solution would be a dedicated "SKIN bay" in all citadels (especially any Blood Raider variants that might come out in the future) that activates the SKINs inside for structure use.
---
You know how refreshing it is to not immediately be downvoted to fuck just for being critical of Blackout? I'm not a krab I just want what's best for the game and everybody in it. Every playstyle should be viable without having to kick over the other guy's chess pieces. Made my first ISK in like... three years or something but I had to switch to mining. I hate it. But ratting is out of the question. I wouldn't mind missions being reworked then brought to null sec. A little bit harder for bots to farm. Gives ratters a chance to at least scan a bomber on the accel gate before being jumped. A little more engaging than brain dead anom farming. If Blackout is to stay then a real discussion without the name calling needs to be had with the intention of making sure everybody walks away happy. This blind fanaticism for whatever gets me the most killmails isn't going to fix the game.
---
I don't normally log into EVE-O forums, but I might make an exception for what I expect to be absolute Dead Sea quantities and concentrations of salt.
---
That does sound like a lot of fun! I'll have to save that fit and give it a shot!
---
Lol you think Fozzie and Rise will buff buffing non kiting ships.
---
A real quick thought I had after reading a post here: How to counter a cloaked ship if your out just exploring anoms? It doesn't show up on D-scan does it? What can you do? Just roll the dice and hope no one is waiting for you?
---
Citadels are owned by corps or aliances. Skins pls
---
sp farming is a long term activity, you can't just simply get a payout whenever you feel like. With plex 4 mil each and current injector/extractor prices you barely keep your account omega. So you need be able to do some other activities parallel to sp farming, that means some base skill ground before even thinking on sp farming. If plex prices drop, you can bank on the situation before the market reacts.
---
Where do you live? Asking for a friend.
---
Lord of gate camping.
---
bad bait is bad
---
We capsuleers are monsters. we treat everyone on our ships and living in our structures as nothing. They come with the ship and die with the ship and we pay no mind to those lives other than the money it costs to replace that ship.
---
Who knew that organisation cant really be nerfed and every attempt will just make it worse for groups will less organisation?
---
CCP didnt/dont, thats for sure.
---
I have been a fan of the changes.  But this one sucks.
---
Keep the current tax in NPC stations and put in an NPC tax in player stations if you want to suck isk out of the game.
---
it's where all of CCP's projects end up: half finished
---
&gt; \-A conflict driver, which may become a mineral sink 
---
I hate to tell you, but there's not enough players in the rest of the game to form a collective force to take on the 3 largest player groups in the game. TTT is going to remain the only player market until someone in that group decides to break the agreement.  Just how it is. You might as well scratch that one off your list.
---
In a C2 WH! 😊😊
---
&gt;the logistics
---
Keep a stock of fuel and scan down a k space. It's honestly pretty easy. Just more risky because no asset safety
---
About 2/5 of fuck all
---
Nope, they instead decided to make it more complicated by adding mutaplasmids.
---
&gt; (Could be from blackout?)
---
no, it's because delve isn't exporting any.
---
source: my margins in 1dq are now arse compared to before the war.
---
It's not that easy, because the SKIN system doesn't support SKINs being registered to a corp or alliance. There's also some confusion as to how that would be implemented, since a corp/alliance isn't a player. Would players activate SKINs on behalf of corps/alliances?
---
Any solution to the problem is clearly going to require a lot of rewriting of some very deep code.
---
Either that or a monkey's about to hit you with a bone.
---
Because our MER kep increasing, even after the rorq nerf, even after the capital rating nerf, even after the new moon mining system ?
---
I'd love to see the capability for a proper value added tax implemented in the eve economy.
---
I was using real world sales tax as an example. A 5% fee compared to 0.1% is MASSIVE.
---
Don't touch my fucking bread, government.
---
This. And only undock them for a real eviction threat or people will evict you just bc you’re bad.
---
And contracts have the price right on them, yet people still buy 1 billion isk contracts when they thought it was 1 million.
---
Someone needs to make the Gadsden flag with a Rattlesnake now
---
just make operating costs higher.... like a lot higher.
---
Dude we sit in Theta comms and shittalk guys who get shot in hyperspartial Supers.
---
Not cheap and can go wrong make sure you check for scrams etc lol. But when it works it glorious.  Fleet up guys in snakes and other missle boats.  They get so frustrated because what they want to lock is instantly dead.
---
Register your displeasure by setting your safety red in hisec and doing whatever comes naturally :P
---
But one day your on one side of k and the next day you are 80 jumps away how do you keep your shit safe
---
You like cloaks. You want 3-500m a week. 
---
Answer is pretty simple tbh. Run relic sites. You can make that much in a day.
---
Yeah you're right it's 3%. You don't pay broker fees on blue loot (assuming you remember to sell it immediate), you pay sales tax.
---
Oh god imagine the tidi.
---
Yes invul timer works anywhere ccp... Wait what
---
I love MTUs you never know what you're gonna find in one! Wait were you talking about something else?
---
Jokes aside i reccomend joining a new player friendly wormhole corp. The environment of requiring everyone to work together or die horribly and lose everything leads to your group working together and getting rid of people who don't play. 
---
Or it dies.
---
Because we're not dirty fucking commies. 
---
Come and take it, frogs.
---
Yeah they removed Phased Weapon Navigation Array Generation Extron and half the playerbase unsubbed in protest
---
Ccpls make this the case again.
---
Member when they employed an economist to work on this stuff? I member.
---
Not sure what you were thinking it was going to be but the price of T2 goods has shot up and we (goons/test/phorde) are burning down offshore citadels like every other day now. Not to mention that with the new tax changes the TTT is going to be guzzling money and depositing it directly into our pockets.
---
Unlike the aesthetic caldari ships that dont at all look like a 1930s radio tower
---
Its a lot bigger than you might think. The biggest NS group decides to boycott HS which has already made ore prices spike. And moon goo has a regional aspect which means some things will become harder and harder to get. 
---
Reserves need to be depleted first but after that it will start to make a rather large impact. 
---
If all of NS decides to boycott HS, well, it wont be pretty.
---
Ewar is far more than flying ECM ships; I also love filling that role and have specialized in it, just fly any other ewar ship besides Caldari and/or use it for small gangs.
---
Lol- it's like watching all of the "yay burn null sec, eat it" posters turn into "wait, why you target high sec next?" Ha ha
---
I'm a simple man I see a video of dead titans I press the upvote button
---
You may be right about null being hopelessly broken culturally. CCP can’t do a whole lot with it one way or the other tbh. I personally like blackout because I always despised having to use local for intel, however having a tool to maybe force Covops in the open is warranted to combat permanent cloaky camping.
---
On a separate but related note, maybe we should all just lobby for increased wormhole connectivity and increased site loot and spawns. If it’s inherently too risky for spreadsheet and not krabs then maybe it can actually be balanced towards sub 50 man fleet pvp?
---
&gt; I've paid roughly 500M isk in just brokerage charges this month
---
I don't know what you're buying/selling but from the sound of it you might want to check if what youre doing on the market is actually making you money.
---
Oh did he get the banhammer? I left when he was still around.
---
It's karma for 2015-17 galmil
---
I wasn't around I'm afraid. 
---
We're happy where we're at.
---
What dodgeball ref?  I just like piss in my coffee.
---
Honestly they were already dead. Having just come back to the game recently, I was shocked at how barren a lot of the non-Jita hubs were when I stopped in to buy stuff. Huge mark-ups, awful selection. Amarr especially caught me by surprise. It used to be a pretty decent option, enough so that it was rarely worth the 10ish jumps to Jita to save a few percent on your purchase.
---
OK retard
---
“First they came for the Nullbears, and I did not speak out—
---
Because I was not a Nullbear.
---
Then they came for the VNI raters, and I did not speak out—
---
Because I was not a VNI rater.
---
Then they came for the Traders, and I did not speak out—
---
Because I was not a Trader.
---
Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.”
---
:joy::joy::joy:
---
Why am I just as annoyed by tax hikes in my make believe space ships game as I am in real life?
---
Don't forget Captain Tom! 
---
I just found him in a wormhole the other day.
---
I can't explain entire finance accounting background history. Short of it, item prices will increase for clients.
---
We've delegated that task to CCP.   They're making good progress on it.
---
oh no you have to pay 6% more to buy your ships you got owned
---
If it doesn't already have it, give it the victory skin: it earned it.
---
It's full of stars!
---
lol no, nothing like that. That comment was cause during a lot of his fleets, his cat would start making trouble.
---
Yeah with the amount of krabbing fedup do im amazed they can only afford feroxes
---
Ha ha- suck it (whoever is angry about this pretty innocent and harmless change to reduce isk from the system).
---
I was thinking the exact same thing. Glad I read it was a mistake before I did.
---
I can't explain entire finance accounting background history. Short of it, item prices will increase for clients. It's not really a "this or that" scenario of some specific percentages, just application of basic finance stuff. Increase fees + increase prices to maintain old margins. 
---
If you have the thought the margins are so huge, you're free to do the work of jumping those items there to make money yourself, reality is they are priced in those regions that much determined by market. 
---
I make the most money shipping stuff INTO Jita. This will decrease liquidity in outer hubs related to extra costs. And increase item prices to compensate for fees.
---
Really? I found it to teach me the opposite.
---
That you can become rich if you're just motivated to succeed in life.
---
&gt;Sorry about the cancer last night, but that's kinda just what happens when you bring Tornados to a Mach fight. GF.
---
Not sure why i was told it as I'm a GalMil pilot. I disagree it was one-sided. In March, while we still had Tier 4, Salt Farmers were dominating in the battlefield, but even at that point they were not able to capture a single system. And literally in couple of weeks everything changed drastically. I doubt it was a common LP farmer migration. How do you explain that exactly the same happened to Minmatar-Amarr space?
---
Not saying null sec is unfixable. But it might be a long and complicated process. So long that fixing the rest of the game like high sec and low sec should come first. Why are WHs so dead in the first place though? As I understand it, it became a monopoly in there. Some fundamental changes may need to occur in Jspace to discourage total domination in conjunction with encouraging people to migrate there as new entities rather than joining the existing ones.
---
I was gonna say something similar, he should also train up a jita alt.
---
Dust was POS lie they rebuilt that POS 5 times before they released it finally using Unreal 3 in China our sub money well managed by group of drunk morons. 
---
Lets Jerk it to Jerking in Stations, Vampire Cloths, and VR. 
---
I think I am going to celebrate the end of CCP by fishing for a mighty white fish salt that bad boy and it Icelandia style, along side broken dreams, promises, with my buddies the Russian Bot farmers. I love them now I don't want them to die.
---
Get on that government bureaucracy gravy train and you're set!

"He who has the most Leshakes Win" - Sun Tzu probably
---
Raven Navy is good because it has an explosion radius bonus and application matters. Scorpion Navy doesn't have that.
---
Otherwise look at the pirate hulls. For missiles it's mordus or gurista. (I assume you are focused there in skills.) Check out the Barghest fit in https://docs.google.com/document/d/1knVqZEH8qFY0eT44nMEFwcKd3t4PbgcZeuv58SVUxsI/pub#h.myrc78pia6l7 if you are willing to spend the isk.
---
There were some hints in some recent newsflashes from RP parties in the game. People were speculating this was the meaning.
---
Reason is supposedly to increase the biggest isk sink in the game. Will it work? No one knows. Regardless, the Law of unintentional consequences will still apply.
---
Just do it.
---
Have a ship that has align time of less than 2secs so that if you see the hunter decloak, you'll be able to warp away before he can lock you up. Sit near the hacking can at 2250m - that way if you see a hunter decloak you can activate your own cloak and warp away (presuming if you have a covops capable ship. Keep mashing that d-scan button, while hacking have your hacking window set up so that you still see your overview clearly. If you have good spacial awareness, don't focus only on the hacking window and are prepared to act in a moment's notice, you will survive most of the encounters
---
Oof Gallente.
---
I scan wormholes almost every day and in the couple years I have been playing I have only come across maybe 5 so far.  Until today seeing 3 in one system was mind boggling.
---
&gt; goal of promoting small gang/small fleet pvp 
---
Was that ever a goal? Eve is a sandbox, people can play it however they want to play it. If large groups want to blob you, then they will. There's no reason you have to fight them though, you can always go find other small groups to fight. I hear if you go into some WH's you can get good smallgang fights
---
To clarify what you are asking, I think you are asking the following: 
---
When we invade the space of a (massively) numerically superior force why is there a mechanic that let's them defend their space with some or all of their assets rather than forcing them to draw straws and meet us in honorable even space bushido?
---
Did I get the question right?
---
Is it Eve without 0.01 isk?  
---
Who will care for the memes!?!?!?
---
I want my own lowsec bridging titan, somedayyyyyyyyy
---
The good news is that the blackout was the first step in breaking up the blocs.
---
taxation is theft
---
where my libertarian brothers and sisters at
---
Oh okey. If Im understanding their numbers correct the tax increase is just 1,25% with max skills. And ye its on buy orders so no brokers fee. Not the end of the world but ye, still a nerf that disproportionately affects WHs.
---
How much would you say an average person makes/day in a WH? Or its impossible to say?
---
I refuse to belive CCP would ever mess things up like that:p
---
For some reason most folks on this sub don't consider cynos a problem.
---
Anyways, the only real solution to this is to move to wormholes.
---
The blackout was the first step in breaking down the blocs.
---
&gt;I fail to see how "escalation on demand" helps the goal of promoting small gang/small fleet pvp.
---
it's not meant to. you're trying to fit a square peg in to a round hole.
---
Icelandick socialism - we get to give you two slaps to the penis and ball sack for one white fish. Yes must say you love CCP, and thank them. Enjoy.
---
Hey, intercepted and almost delivered package the other day. Cheers for the content mate!
---
When signing up for eve, where was it advertised that they wanted you to “fly in small weaker gangs” and not be escalated on?
---
I missed that advertisement, all i ever read was expect to be killed
---
Monopoly teaches that you only get wealthy owning prime Atlantic City real estate.  Donald Trump owned prime Atlantic City real estate.
---
I think that makes Monopoly racist.
---
You are doing it wrong.
---
Increase tax to pay for local fuel whatever shortage too?
---
Did you read it? Of course you didn't. You just want to white-knight for Zion. Newsflash goy, they don't need your help. In fact they think its funny to watch us fight ourselves. Grow up.
---
eve pvp is plenty good, if you're looking for the kind of pvp eve provides.
---
if you want to show how you can take on a team of six on your own with your 360noscopeheadshot skills.... yeah eve isn't the game for you, there are plenty of other games that are.
---
weebstar when?
---
I think we might just be looking at it in a completly different way. For me, I manufactured items to make a larger profit on my ore than when I sold it directly. For this I asked a corp member with perfect refine skills to refine it, costing me barely anything, and then I made an assortment of items with good margins from the corp blueprints. 
---
Now since I was mining way nearer a small hub than near Jita, it made sense to sell there. Of course throughput isn't great, you sell only a few of each module each day, but because of that there are few sellers and thus prices are high, also because nobody wants to go all the way to another trade hub to get it cheaper.
---
So in my view, if local supply goes down, players who used to only mine start manufacturing stuff themselves and selling it for extra profit, which is a balancing factor to the fact that people who fly in massive amounts of stuff from a trade hub get higher costs and thus higher prices.
---
Last week? Somewhere between 140 and 160, I'm not entirely sure.
---
Wow I never thought of this I love the idea of nerfing cynos I love the idea of subcaps takeing and holding a field without worry of just being able to drop supers/caps instantly
---
The screenshot is taken with the Victory skin ;)
---
Sorry I missed the fight. Sounds like a cracking time had by all involved.
---
Hardly
---
In wormhole fights it's stronger than before, since you can actually rep your ECM ships and the meta switch towards leshaks.
---
Ok then it should have been visible for you when you are logged in to our website... 
---
But I suppose you want it to be public? :D
---
Move to wormholes or make some friends if you want to avoid cynos. But if you are trying to take control of space in nullsec, even npc null, you’ll need to earn it through fighting or diplomacy. If you’re getting dropped while trying to defend your stuff, find a larger alliance that is an enemy of whoever is dropping on you and ask them for help. Or send a mail to the diplo of the alliance that’s dropping you and ask if there’s any way you can work out a NIP (non invasion pact).

The monopoly thing is just people memeing or not understanding. It really truly is a huge number of totally independent entities, like city-states. There are also far more groups in there than you would think. You just don’t hear from the 2-300 5-15 man groups in comparison to null blocks making news.
---
Towards fixing null, I think being able to turn off another ship’s cyno if you do, fit, or risk X would be beneficial to stopping the reliance on instant grid umbrellas.
---
This could be done multiple ways, by allowing blops/recons to fit a cyno disruption module, or by having cyno inhibitors online in under 60 seconds would be some good starting points imo.
---
I mean, my alliance (Vindicative) is attacking new null in Cache (fuckall far away from anything. Including further from lowsec than our prior winterco space). So we're doing literally the exact opposite of moving to lowsec and harassing lowseccers. 
---
So no, I'm downvoting you because your assertion sounds retarded. Also your incorrect from my perspective and relevant experience. Finally, im also downvoting because your claiming that downvotes constitute proof somehow. Downvotes do not.
---
Even if nullseccers were leaving null in droves to play in lowsec, why would nullsec alliances try to hide that they are finding more content. There would be propaganda, shitposts, battle reports and shitfit killmails being posted daily. And weren't lowseccers hungry for more content? So what the fuck is the problem anyway.
---
I sometimes wonder whether people who post comments like this have actually spent any time doing incursions. Or if they ever tried any role other than F1 monkey.
---
&gt; Well, this is the first I'm hearing about 64-bit programs magically taking double the memory. 
---
Well, this is the first I'm hearing about "up to" meaning "all must be exactly like this". /s
---
The worst-case scenario is double.  Like all worst-case scenarios, it's unlikely.  64 bit will use more memory, but the exact amount depends on the program and how much you optimize your code for it.
---
PI installations snap in to place on a hex grid, and layouts can be saved as templates and imported/exported to be used on other planets.

oh and remove the size of the planet from the calculation of link cpu/pg - it's just retarded and makes some planets shit and unuseable - there's nothing fun or interesting about that.

Nah I been doing it for while man 3 accounts since 2010 , plenty of pvp kills and dead’s , it gets boring .

Killed supers  ,titans , keepstars , frigates , solo , small gang , gate camps , blobs , etc , done almost all pvp aspect of eve , it’s fun don’t get me wrong , but that’s not what I want to do all day everyday when I play eve , it gets boring.

Some sexy Galmil on ex Galmil action. Gotta love it.
---
Jin'taan and even Falcon to some extent have conveyed that subcap and cap/supercap warfare is no longer balanced (The obselescense of subcapitals). My opinion is that "win button" cynos are in line with that argument of imbalance. I'm not disputing that Eve is a sandbox and can be played anyway an individual wants to. Although in the case of cynos it's promoting a mechanic that hurts new players and emerging groups the hardest.  There's basically no counter other than banking on the sportsmanship of the guy with supers at his disposal.

I would love to hear how you think CCP is all about the bottom line profits when we just had this recent TalkingInStations. Is it because of the "ermahgurd" skins that dont do shit to the gameplay? Is it the worthless alpha skill injectors that are arguably the same as omega time? In what way do you think CCP is trying to milk it's players in the form of actual true P2W MMO's because I have played many.

A lot of us have been around for awhile, and have friends in NSH, Valkyrie alliance etc from our GW days a few years back, whom a few of us fly with sometimes, and recently Centi has poked us for some content timers we have tagged along with. But we aren’t blue.
---
Other alliances can have their opinions or whatever on what they think we are, we’ve been called pets for basically every alliance out there. People seem to get salty when they bring 5-7 alliances and 300-500 man fleets and we accept assistance when people offer. It’s not often that we batphone.
---
Typically, we only call other people when we our seriously ourformed, because we would rather fight than stand down.
---
But our goal is always good fights, just pretty hard to find those nowadays in null. Everyone just prefers to max blob with all of their friends, and get salty when we reactively do the same.
---
For what it’s worth, I assume people have their minds made up by whatever they are told.

Its not bad. But the only way I see it working is to not create locustfleets because they will just rotate regions with superfleets.
---
Instead just lower the amount of people one system can hold. Put 2 large mining belts in each system with a 24h cooldown. Large enough for maybe 5 fulltime rorqs. That way you will get people to spread forcing multiple, weaker umbrellas, And you also get worse intel and so on.
---
Right now a system can hold maybe 20 fulltime rorqs. 
---
But honestly, NS could use a complete overhaul. Its so outdated with truesec, anoms of which like only 25% are used, DEDs which make no sense, DED loot which is factional and doesnt make any real sense outside of lore, ADMs/sov and so on.

The problem is wanting people to build empires and then want to say.. but let's change space so there can't be empires. Gotta choose. Also, any change ever made will not change that some groups of people will seek to group together and build an empire. Better to try to aim for healthy mechanics overall.

I feel you man... I feel every time I go out in FW nowadays I get into a solo fight, only to die to 5-10 guys soon after...
---
Imbalanced things get nerfed all the time. Your argument that  because it exists in it's present state it must be accepted holds no real value. This is a game with parameters. I'm just defining my view that one such parameter promotes imbalance with no practical gain.
---
Although admittedly I may be wrong. If there's a gameplay enhancing reason to have ability to instanly drop supers on a cruiser gang I'm all ears. I've yet to hear or come up with one.
---
I bought a tractor beam on my new account until I can afford an MTU (mainly afford to lose one)

Always wondered why does it require complex solution. Citadel SKIN item. Buy it, fit it into a special slot. Works like a rig - one time use, can't be removed.

Ferox is what nullbears use. Its cheap, effective and if you feed a fleet or 5, no biggie.
---
Oh ye Im with you. No change can be done without people actually being on board, otherwise people will just opt out. I can totally understand how people feel empirebuilding has gone too far tho, cause it has. I think most in NS feels that way and have been for a while. But unfortunately when changes hit they are so extreme that it just hurts the game all together.

Was thinking about the idea of all sov systems being one way cyno jammed except for along sov borders. So the majority of the legwork would be done by subcaps in these border systems. And some kind of structure in your own space can remotely open a path for your capitals into hostile space X times a week or whatever. So supers can still be thrown around. But sparringly. But if you were relying on them solely to take sov it would be mind numbingly slow. And you'd need the subs to defend those border systems. It makes sense to me that a null sec giant should technically be able to win with superior firepower. But a smaller entity should be able to make it painful and slow enough that it might not even be worth it if they can't win the sub fights. And dreads would have to be exempt from the rule otherwise how else do you kill ratting supers. Doesn't directly address the problem of how many supers people have and how unbalanced they are so perhaps a proper rebalance would be preferable. And I don't know if it's too complicated a system to be fullproof.
---
Still thinking about that. If I'm part of a fleet that kills them, but I'm not primarily responsible or even on the killmail, does that count? Not sure yet.

Gonna be honest, I had no idea who you were until that comment. It just seemed to be from zkill like you guys are tag teaming to beat up on smaller alliances like whoever the hell [Arkhos Core](https://zkillboard.com/br/110580/) and [Reverberation Project](https://zkillboard.com/br/110554/) are with much larger groups than they can field. [This seemed like a good fight](https://zkillboard.com/br/110581/) if you had some caps.

I wouldn't mind some lore BS that makes SKINS for citadels "apply once" only.
---
welcome to r/eve, we're all experts at everything!
---
15 chars is not bad at all. but let's assume you can only really handle about 10-12 well
---
you're going to want something on the fast side that can engage just beyond drekavac range... arty HFIs or sleips might be a decent place to start.... cancer fit your astra hard to nuetralize their logi and try to pressure them with good target swaps
---
against an equal force that might be OK... against greater numbers.... there's not many ships in eve that can overcome numbers disadvantage

This. This exactly.

Solo PVP has been being rammed into the ground since 2014, where have you been?
---
It taught me that success is pretty random, unless you load the dice.
---
Bush did B-R
---
From what I gather it's a 2 minute activation time. I see the need for a bubble type cyno inhibitor that lights as fast as the cyno does but with short range. 2 minutes is a long time to activate when the cyno is basically instant.
---
You can also look at the typhoon, it’s a pretty versatile ship that can launch 4 sentries IIRC with cruise missiles as well. Cheap mans rattlesnake. 
---
Additionally look at downgrading into something that speed tanks like a gila or tengu. They can pump out similar dps and are quite fun to fly, just watch your transversal.
---
Those groups are just nearby groups in our timezone of similar size, so content wise makes sense.
---
That battle report was a fun fight, but what it doesn’t show is the 40+ panfam nightmare fleet etc that were on standby to jump in from their side. So we skirted the grid, shot some things, whored on the fort, and bounced.
---
that....could be nice actually.  hmm.

Yiiii remove asset safety!!

Yes, there is. Remove multiboxing.
---
The issue wasn't how far they could jump, but they could jump in rapid succession with zero fatigue. So how far they could jump was literally only limited by how much fuel they carried.
---
It is perfectly balanced. They light a cyno, you too should light one. It is called escalating the fight, and is how the best battles that you read about usually start.

Pretty simple.  They’re cutting industry out at the legs to force the players into buying pled for the pvp/blingy ships.  Prices of all ships and mods will increase steadily towards the end of the year.  It’s a very smart move to raise revenue, and will simulate the PA model of pay to win.  PvP in Eve is best heart pounding PvP I’ve ever experienced, that being said after I burn my 20 bill isk on PvP I can’t stomach the thought I need to buy plex to buy my blingy ships.  Still always away but we’ll see.

also no d-scan shortcut and only 3 ov tabs..
---
Making it harder to move the fuckers instantly is good. They should not be more maneuverable than any/every other ship class. Personally I’d like to see them being forced to warp around more. It’s the instant grid application that is a problem. 
---
Maybe allow the cyno to light anywhere, but always forces the destination to be a random grid near the local star.
---
I think that's as hard a question to answer as 'how much does an average nullsecer make'. There are so many different types of player in wormholes, and even more so because the income you can generate is so dependent on what's available in your chain.
---
Hundreds of millions per hour I guess is the area, when actually trying to make ISK.

&gt; We are confident because of the high rate of users embracing 64 bit that when we introduce the 2500 per month plex cost, they will happily accept that as well.

No seriously now captcha on market trading should be no problem as you still need to wait for the 5 minutes, just make it so you can enter it before.
---
Also some simple new ability on ships could make a captcha get implemented while ratting.
---
2% dmg slow down if you get it right or 2% increase if correct to a max of 30%.

Audio and simple visual cues could constitute some sort of combo captcha

---
To seek marginal advantage on buy orders (At least) more people will use TTT (owned by the blue doughnut kings of null sec), thus increasing net inflows of brokerage fees, thus increasing the wealth of the richest toons in Eve, irrespective of increase in NPC sales tax sinks
---
Oh sit here we go again
---
Two of my accounts have toons which are stuck in Skilling Spree "Unallocated Skill Points Added".  Doesn't seem to be this issue; however, quite annoying.  I reported a bug, with pretty pictures, and also submitted a support ticket.  So far no change and no response from CCP.  I am sad.  Even an hour or two off a skill train is helpful.

* Automatically jump to an offline star system after it comes online. After downtime when you try to jump to a system that nobody has entered yet you can't and just get a message. Then you need to give the jump command again after the target system has loaded.
---
While technically true he is former CSM and understands how game mechanics work at a very high level. I reference him and his Eve discussions because of his game knowledge and past experience as opposed to current formal title. I think any open minded person could see the distinction. 
---
And I agree that counterdropping is about the only defense currently. I'm not disputing that at all. But if that's not an option there is no other besides dock up. That's a "win button". I don't see how such gameplay is in line with promoting diverse and "harsh but fair" gameplay.

its an isk sink. a drone boat can rat for a month and as long as they aren't losing drones it wont cost them anything. needing fuel for your ship will require you to be more efficient and strategic in your gameplay, or pay more for all your fuel. smaller ships will use less fuel, larger will use more. looking to fly an interceptor fleet 100's of jumps in search of an easy kill? its going to take fuel, which your small cargohold can only hold so much of. the amount of isk being generated in eve is not good for it, it never will be. its just going to hurt the game at an exponential rate. when is the last time you killed something and went " yeah, thats gona hurt them!"

I'd keep them client side (for easy sharing) but have them auto-save on server side like many other games/services. When you boot up fresh, it asks if you'd like the cloud saved version instead.

Imagine warping titans in tidi though. Maybe supers as an instant win button isn't so bad if they're forced to be used so sparingly that you use them for only the most crucial of fights. If you're forced to invade sov from the border inward unless you want to face their supers with your subcaps then certain systems like chokepoints could be so much more important. Though I can't imagine there being very much super on super action anymore.

JF's get most of their capacitor from citadels whether docking or tethering between jumps. it really wouldnt cost them any more. this would mainly cost ships that active rep, warp alot, or use cap for turrets like mining ships or turret boats.

What I mind is that there is still a HUGE, probably greater, incentive to use player trade hubs.  This increases the amount of passive isk generated by entrenched entities  (entrenched because of game mechanics).

I can't agree with that. If anything, that would just make it more difficult for the smaller groups. We don't have tens of thousands of people to pass us intel, light cynos and scout our fleets. We use alts for that.

Most of the Indy peeps I’m assuming were the krabs and Rorq miners.  So now that I rarely see any of those unless it’s a rorq with augmented mining drones.  I’m stating that with the down trend in ore being mined, which is the necessity of building ships, and salvagers for mods that the flow of both ore and salvaged parts to build ships decreasing will increase overall prices as the months go by.  Less materials incoming, higher prices.  Ratting has been almost wiped out now except for super ratting.  Less isk income means you’ll have to cover the lower rate/flow of isk, ore, salvage parts.  Meaning more people will have to buy plex to afford the higher priced, and future prices, ships
---
Holy hell no, that’s it! 
---
If both sides know their caps are going to be forced to warp from the local star then whoever establishes subcap grid control with bubbles can dictate the fight. This would actually make subcaps relevant to holding a grid with caps.

non jump fuel could be sold by npc's, like blueprints. and should be relatively cheap. a cruiser cargohold full would ideally last several days or a week, and cost should be really cheap. the main downside would be logistics, which would give lesser transport pilots something to haul, it would give market hubs something else to carry and even in pvp it would be nice to get fuel from a gank, especially if you are far from friendly space.

nerfing the umbrella does not mean the umbrella gets bigger.  Today it covers as much as it needs to in ONE umbrella.  If you need multiple umbrellas to cover one entity you are making it so there can be cracks.  And that someone can make the "Home Fleet" (the REAL defense fleet) not able to deploy easily to all of the owned territories.  This is a BUFF to strategy and skill.

I actually had this same thought. He was dead off last time (nullsec didn't get control of the entire market) but this seems like a solid push to make that more and more a reality. Trading without giving a cut to nullblocs is apparently being made to be far more  noncompetitive than before.That's not a good change at all and removes many options from the sandbox.
---
So slap the tax on Player stations only.  That is where the real volumes of isk trade.
---
more isk in a PLEX trade than in whole swaths of popular rigs or t1 ships, for example.
---
Falcon should go the way of Jack in the Titanic movie.
---
That would actually just make the rich richer. People selling 10.000 of something will just spread out more and continue to undercut competition. People who're selling 10 or 1? Well, they get fucked and will have lost most of the value if they ever even get it sold.

People selling 10 items can reprice their stack for .5% of the cost of 10 items (5% of 1 item price). People selling stacks of 1000 will need to spend .5% of 1000 items (a cost equivalent to 5 items). Small sellers with smaller stacks will be more agile than bigger sellers.

Not really, my trader toon has lvl 5 brokerage skill and a standing of 6.2 with the Caldari Navy and I'm hit with a brokerage fee of 2.38% in Jita 4-4, whilst TTT has a brokerage fee of 0.5% - a differential of 1.88% on every trade.
---
Going forward, my broker fee in Jita 4-4 will be 4.38% vs 0.5% - a differential of 3.88% on every trade.
---
Simple economics says all my buy orders are going into TTT and as many of the sell orders, as I'm comfortable with, will go there too.

thank you for this entertaining AAR, would read again
---
Here at ccp we have heard your complaints about incredibly boring structure grinds in high sec so that your bloc leaders can take in some passive isk.
---
It looks to us like this is mostly settled with all the biggest blocs banding together to distribute the wealth amongst each other, this reduces the passive isk to an amount that really isnt worth fighting over and ends the tedious high sec structure grinding for members.
---
Instead of this we've decided to massively buff the passive income these stations provide. We see this having two possible outcomes. Either the big blocs become more entrenched and get richer further contributing to the rich get richer state of eve while they also have to deal with boring bashes against small groups trying to compete, or the agreement breaks and the big groups fight each other in constant tedious structure bashes while either one group or a rotation of groups claim the passive revenue either making one group rich or effectively replicating the all groups divide it outcome but much more tedious and frustrating.

Type where you wanna go in any chat, right click, link to solar system, station ext.. should turn yellow, set as destination, undock. Hit the “A” on the top right of your screen to activate auto pilot. There is also a key bind to it but I never use auto pilot for reasons I’ll tell you below.
---
So.. don’t use it. You warp to a gate further away and the auto pilot has to burn to each gate before it jumps or docks in a station. You can change the route to avoid dangerous systems however if anyone sees you gating using auto pilot you are just asking to get popped for the lolz..

It’s cool to see someone who has a say and an understanding of CCP’s internal culture get involved with us. That’s more than we can say of Hilmar or most of the CSM.

On a personal level, I do agree with a lot of his suggestions for EVE, but this thread isn’t about that. Even if I get downvoted to oblivion, it’s all good. I stand by my thread.
---
Ccp falcon is alright though
---
Holy carp you have a friend working for 343?
---
Yeaa... I think you entirely misunderstand monopoly. It's fundamentally rigged to give the game to whoever gets the biggest start by chance, with the potential for them to get lucky and throw it to the second luckiest.
---
howso? pay more tax per transaction must not be a good thing when investing in items and such?
---
I get the reference, I just thought I found something special :( I guess that they've been found before and that there's no actual point other than being an Easter egg.
---
This is going to be a tough goal to achieve because they removed the watchlist. You will have no way of knowing if your target is logging in. Locator agents or locates are us will help you find them, but it does no good if they aren't logged in.
---
Refit saved fittings on a mobile depot or the service bay of a ship.
---
you can have citadel skins but they are taxed 10% of the value of your citadel each month and cannot be removed. citadels with skins applied cannot have the skins removed and cannot be unanchored. the owner of the citadel becomes a slave of ccp if and when their isk cannot automatically pay the taxes.
---
also, in null, your skins will not show. they still cost the same and are single use - disappear from inventory when applied to a citadel, but they are blacked out from showing.

Lowsec for snuff is a formality now, i'm not saying that's a bad thing btw, but they're not even close to their roots, hell i'd say they're probably even further now.

&gt;People selling 10 items can reprice their stack for .5% of the cost of 10 items (5% of 1 item price)
---
So if t hey need to do this twice, they've already lost 1% of value. With trade taxes this means if their item had less than 5-6% profit they've already made a loss.
---
Meanwhile, the big sellers with big stacks will just list small stacks. They don't lose anything. They don't need to spend the .5% every time because they just create a new order, get to choke out competition into loss and let their items that get "outpriced" sell over time instead.
---
There is no "big seller with big stacks". They can be as competitive as 100 little guys and reap all the profits while making sure the actual little guys won't get squat.
---
The traders don’t pay the tax, the final consumer does. The spread will just widen by the increase of fee and tax, with margin and profits the same.
---
I mean as someone who is in horde im gonna be a bit biased, but horde is a great place to get back into pvp. We have almost all varieties, with medium to large fleet pvp being almost constantly available, and if you want to fly small gang there are always people looking to take some ships out and fight. And we can always use more pilots.
---

As I have said before temper your expectations.  I hope it is good for the game but I have doubts of the community being as resilient and CCP seems to think we are.

The first tax hike by CCP two years ago crippled them. This round will kill them.

Haven't you figured put you cannot criticize Hilmar or Falcon in front of their Reddit fanboi base?  Holy fuck!

Yeah, I didn't mention him because I was listing the mysterious occurrences around New Eden. Captain Tom was put in the game by CCP as a tribute to David Bowie after his untimely passing.

I am per"plex"ed as to why this would happen.
---
Ehefkae took blap dreads plus apostle into HKs home. Our cap guardians were taken down very fast at the start and the cap pressure from the HK bhaals made it hard to keep webs on primaries consistantly. In the end, the loki wing was putting so much pressure on our subs that the Apostle couldn't keep them up and we started to break. Once that happened it's all over and just wait for the HK fleet to chew through the EHP remaining. 
---
Was a gf from HK. We tried something a bit different to counter the Leshaks that have become common but it didn't pay off. See you next time.
---
The only players CCP wants are walllet warriors
---
Cool guys. Every several years they return to EVE, reinstall their corp under new ticker, provide top content for several months and then go back to stasis.
---
To cloud the fact that taxes don’t matter for the big money but broker fees, which are not touched for citadels, and are the income for the blue donut. Rule, always exaggerate the less important part to distract the readers from the truth.
---
HK fc here: this was actually the I guess last iteration in months of theorycrafting by highclass wh corps to see how to best fight and include the leshak in heavy armor  meta.
---
afk went for a blap dread comp (cap gun dreads with 99% web vindis to make them apply) and a LOT of ewar to keep our leshaks from spooling, paired with a bunch of smartbombs.
---
we went with a leshak comp with lokis to shoot different damage types and to kill enemy ewar ships (theyre faster and apply better), leshaks for heavy damage and bhaals to neut out enemy ewar etc.  
---
at the start it seemed a lot like afk were gonna win cause our leshaks could just not spool up due to their slepnirs and other ewar breaking their spools by jamming them, but as we slowly started to kill more ewar with our lokis we kinda snowballed towards winning the fight. fight was basically over when their last vindi died (their main dps, dreads, couldnt apply anymore) and the rest was basicaly just grinding through caps and killing whatever lasted  
---
was a really interesting fight, props on afk for jumping into our home and fighting us here, im really curious as to how both sides will change their comps for next time.
---
We need shark week 2.0 ASAP
---
Delve has all the good systems in it being farmed quite a bit. Same for goon owned querious and fountain. Obviously no one wants to rat in systems with -.01 sec status, but that’s because CCP made them useless for ratting, not because people want to cluster up.
---
I need a hot pink fortizar please. Rosada Dawn
---
didnt blob as hard as the aar shows, had about 5/10 more dudes then they had, had some people warp in when the fight was over to help grind through the caps
---
That expression has so many uses totally outside of its link to the holocaust. This is one of the features of a great saying, that its message and values convey meaning applicable to every aspect of life. 
---
To try and limit its use to only its origin is belittling its overall message. Which is; unity of different values under the same threat of attack, should stand together.
---
Honestly I thought it taught me a good lesson:   Making good strategic decisions doesn't always work out and there is shit you can do about it, but that doesn't mean you should stop making them.  If you don't, you're definitely fucked.
---
Gf, will see you in our home next time :)
---
Make all systems equal for ratting. Maybe if 3-4 systems per region weren’t superior to all the others then people would spread out a bit
---
There are player structures around those hubs and they are used even for semi-expensive items like faction ships. And given that a lot of populationi n jita is worthless scum, some might engage in more regional trading for profit. Especially Dodixie for reason of being the closest to monitor the orders.
---
lol, are you surprised? HK and blobbing, name a more iconic duo.
---
Praise Bonga \o/
---
Ohh yeah? Then stop using all those state funded stargates and you can forget about docking in npc stations if that’s what you think about taxes!
---
I mean look at CCP. When was the last time they were organized or a smart business? They created a game that attracts people that do logistics, strategy, business, engineering, and everything ccp isn't, we only share some degree of autism. No wonder they didn't expect  us to adapt and overcome.
---
TL;DR Cynos are an important thing to balance, but they are tied to the rest of the capital meta, so it will probably have to be part of a wider balancing effort. Basically, the entire capital ship part of the game is a hold-over from trying to revamp a problematic sov system and causing a bunch of power creep in the process.And naturally, people who invested in it want to keep it as is because of the cost they've sunk into it, despite the fact that the original mechanics that caps were supposed to counter are now non-existent for the most part.
---
Waaaay back in the day (in 2004), we had no sov (among other things...we also had no anoms or citadels or asset safety, we had to rat in the belts to get 200-250mil and tech2 fit a battleship with 100km range for fleet combat, and we had to warp around and manually launch scan probes too, fun times). Stations in null were similar to NPC stations with a small difference: you could get your buddies in a fleet of battleships, shoot at it and once the shields were down, you had conquered the station. Then you could set docking rights to lock out the previous owners and let your guys in (and you had to allow them corp by corp based on standings, because there was no formal in-game mechanic for alliances). And this is how people fought wars and conquered space in null.
---
This led to quite a few fights naturally, but it also led to a lot of alarm-clock operations and stations changing hands throughout the day, depending on who had the most pilots online at the time (this was called timezone station ping-pong).
---
So, CCP introduced starbases (the POSs that have been recently scrapped). Spam POS towers at the moons (and kill enemy towers) and whoever had more towers in system could capture the station. You could also reinforce them with strontium to make sure that you as the defender would be setting the time of the engagement, forcing the attacker to go on alarm clock ops. Problem was, there were only large towers at the time and the biggest ship was the battleship. And battleships really struggled to take them down, resulting in a lot of structure grinding. Then lo and behold, here come the dreadnoughts, ships with the explicit purpose of grinding structures. No HAW weapons or anything like that, and no real damage application to sub-caps, except maybe battleships in certain cases. Then come the carriers, with a focus on moving supplies, repairing and fielding swarms of drones that crashed server nodes, motherships (similar but bigger and with clone bays) and eventually titans, which someone thought it would be a good idea if they could fire doomsdays remotely through a jump bridge (and doomsdays back then killed everyhing on grid).
---
It was at this point that a lot of my guys started quitting the game due to the evident and imminent power creep in play (plus those big ships are slower than the offspring of a snail, a turtle and a sloth who came together in a bizarre orgy of nature probably narrated by  David Attenborough), and we didn't like it at all that we were pretty much forced to train into them to maintain some relevance. Fast forward a decade or so and a lot of things have changed. Players now build their own stations, the majority of the old ones have probably been converted into outposts or citadels (not sure which) and POS are getting phased out of the game. As time went on more and more people trained into caps as well, which led to a lot more of these ships being fielded, especially after injectors were added to the game.
---
So you get the "hot dropping frigates with our carriers half way across the galaxy" phase, that resulted in the introduction of fatigue, and more changes to sov and structure bashing, and suddenly you have a massive problem looming on the horizon now that POS are getting phased out: you have these big, expensive ships that everyone has a hard-on for and spent ages (or just a lot of real life cash) training into, and they are about to be out of a role to play.
---
So they make them apply damage well enough to sub-caps (and in some cases instalock them too), completely breaking the basic axiom of the game that "bigger is nastier but smaller is more slippery and can still kill bigger stuff, death by 1000 cuts style", and you end up with the current stagnant meta of cap umbrellas and what not.
---
So, why the history lesson? Well, because cynos are not an isolated mechanic but are part of all that. You can't nerf cynos easily, same as you can't easily nerf capitals in any meaningful way, because a bunch of people will start foaming at the mouth due to the investment required to get them (it's case of sunk costs really).
---
Or can you? In recent discussions here, it's evident that even members of the biggest nullblocs have begun to realize the detrimental effect caps have on the game (at least in their current implementation), and CCP has taken notice as well (as evidenced by certain targeted nerfs during the last months/year and their talks of the need to shake the game up). So what do you do? Well, i'd say completely rebalance caps with specific roles, make them useless against subcaps without subcap support of their own and then run a time limited event for no-penalty extractors/injectors, so people who don't want to keep flying them can simply extract and dump their SP into something else they might like without taking a SP loss.
---
I've seen loads of ideas floating around this subreddit and some of the most interesting were:
---
1. Cynos take time to spool up, during which you get a chance to inhibit them.
---
2. Add cyno inhibitor probes for interdictors/heavy interdictors.
---
3. Add an amount of inaccuracy to a cyno, depending on player skills, light years travelled or a host of other possible variables (cap remaining on jump initiation, previous fatigue, etc). Or even a mass limit on the cyno, but not exactly like wormholes. Say you can still jump and it will remain open, but the more mass you jump, the more inaccuracy you get. In this way, you can still jump an entire fleet in system, but it won't be on the same grid. You need to regroup and form up before going to fight, and if you're jumping into systems with enemy presence you need control of the system to ensure that stragglers won't get picked off, which is a perfect job for subcaps (go in first, secure the field, bring in the caps to bash the structures).
---
4. To keep JFs from being totally trash under these mechanics, give them the ability to use covert cynos (with or without high slot/cloak).
---
5. Adjust citadel damage thresholds and damage caps, so that capital ships do more damage to structures than subcaps can. Adjust application so that they do less damage to subcaps (they should be somewhat ok against battleships, in the way a cruiser can track frigates, but they shouldn't be able to hit smaller stuff on their own).
---
Overall, if you ask me, the main problem with the way big battles and wars are fought in EvE, is that they are more like medieval sieges and less like modern combined arms warfare. I think the game would be more fun if people could affect strategic outcomes with smaller ships, because that would entice people to spread out and fight across multiple systems, instead of blobbing up on a single gate/citadel and having to play at 90% TiDi.  Everything should have a counter and ideally, the counters should be asymmetric. You know, rock-paper-scissors style, not  the "i'll just bring bigger or more of the same stuff as you" style that we currently have.
---
What EvE needs is mechanics that provide possibilities for more interdiction of enemy supply lines, guerilla warfare, area denial with mobile forces and blitzkrieg tactics (small, fast, mobile units laying the groundwork before the big guns come in), and less static warfare (e.g, drop a citadel in the enemy's staging so we can sit in tether and play ping-pong with fighters). Cynos are definitely a part of that whole thing, but in order to get them right CCP should probably have made up their minds first about the role they want capitals to play from here on out. Otherwise we may get changes to cynos that are good for the current meta, but when capitals get rebalanced as well the changed cynos are problematic again (either leading to unintended buffs to capitals that undo all the previous balancing work done, or being unintended nerfs that make capitals completely useless).
---
Can we just buff other options instead? Med guns are not great except a few options. BS guns are.. well, BS.
---
The wormhole one does more damage then the NS one.
---
Something good for the whole game actually happening and no one is batting a eye
---
good idgaf get rid of it all, I'll fly between systems
---
All those changes seem awesome to me and buff my playstyle, directly or tangentially. Seems that I got a fine train to ride for now.
---
Well, until now I thought the only way for this to happen was if you kept podding someone every time they left their home station. Here's to many more years of learning new things about EVE!

I can literally feel my brain cells giving out one by one

Gameplay enhancing? 
---
Its a sandbox, it isnt there to "enhance your gameplay" in PVP.  Your idea of "gameplay" is literally to ruin others' gameplay by destroying their game assets.  I get you dont find it "gameplay enhancing" when they counter your small fast kitey bullshit with things that counter it. But thats your choice to have that be "your gameplay".  
---
There is no real value to something that can only win against pve ships, but cloaking exists with ganks.  There is no real value to having no local with all the sovereignty upgrades lore wise or otherwise, but that exists.
---
The game doesnt exist for you to kill other players and survive. It exists so they can kill you too.  If you don't like it, make a non sandbox version of eve
---
I like u/CCPFalcon. Even if I haven't been part of the community for long, from what I've seen he's honest, approachable, and possesses *just* the right amount of good-natured irreverence without crossing the line into being offensive about it. After all the drama over the last decade with lying devs and shady behavior, he's a wonderful breath of fresh air.
---
The good guys win again
---
In real life that happens because of the loopholes. No loopholin' the universally-applied tax.
---
It does increase the sink part and can be a part of the solution though.
---
honestly, just fuck off. if you think pve is more engaging than pvp, you are an absolute retard
---
ah yes, that old argument, hear it a lot irl - recently our state govt put a 10c levy on all one-use plastic bottles, and let me tell you that not every drink in a plastic bottle of drink has gone up 10c, some more, some in fact are now cheaper. and to make things worse, this is eve, can highsec bankers cartel-ise as  easily especially as more nullsec people stop sending materials up and start sending final products to directly compete?
---
btw that 'trade cartel owning the hubs in new eden' you speak of, its likely their members died securing their position more times than all the trit that constitutes that keepstar; they've undocked a good, active number of times too. in fact my first run in with test would be in calmil lowsec when they were pushed into militia, on the verge of extinction in relative terms, trying to rebuild. they are also a combined collective of thousands of players, and their trading hub is now being backed by thousands more; it actually makes a whole lot of sense for such an entity to control something major like this in eve online and the fact that people can just bypass player driven content - like a player market - is a relic in the game from a time foregone. my point is, in this case, this version of '1%' is literally reliant on keeping the approval of their player base to survive, and highsec bankers do not.
---
Ok then don’t man.

Congrats, your videogame is now a modern program? Wtf hilmar.

Take my upvote good sir, I’m moving along.

I enjoy mining. I left hisec because its impossible to mine there without buffer tanking orcas.  I enjoy industry.  
---
I get people enjoy pvp and want to kill things and hate that things can kill them back, but that isnt, never will be, and SHOULDNT be my problem. The "carebears" who think eve is about killing other players... BUT ONLY IF THEY CANT BE STOPPEd because otherwise thats "too safe"... its ridiculous hypocracy.
---
I dealt with hisec nerfs.  I dealt with removal of static dedspaces for my casual play.  I dealt with blops being introduced and black ops cynos and the changes to jump range and fatigue.  
---
Now I dealt with local being removed, but if I have to try harder to MINE 20mil/hour than people have to try to kill me, this game is dead to me and good riddance.  Yes yes "nice knowing you" and the other childish edgy bullshit, but ive put up with a LOT of changes to make ganking safer and easier for ten years, and I'm tired of that being the only focus of gameplay instead of telling people to try harder and learn how to counter things.  
---
Try harder.  Learn to counter things.  Someone mining doesnt hurt you.  Someone mining doesnt destroy the game or make people quit.  Someone mining doesnt need to be the all killing end feature that MUST die because its too hard to "stop them" because its "effort".
---
Its gotten ridiculous. and sorry... but Fuck your flair.
---
This is an excellent response. Thank you.
---
They lose when their undercut stacks don't sell, those stacks have to be cancelled or repriced. Adding a cost to undercutting increases price stickiness, which allows smaller sellers to sneak in an undercut here or there.
---
&gt;Improve the market search to something from this century.
---
No kidding. It's astonishing that it only recognizes exact match searches. You type in "200mm plates" and it pulls up nothing. Not to mention I'd love the ability to check prices in other regions without the use of external tools or alts, even if it required me to choose a specific system/station.
---
yea, BL batphoned us and instead of baiting they brought supers, ruined the fight, so we voted on TS and decided to kill them
---
I've never seen anyone beg for microtransactions as much as the EVE community has.

Wow I'm surprised
---
Message me
---
Will do 🙂
---
The original was, but the mass-produced one was designed to to the opposite.
---
That's not what marketing is.
---
You're approaching this from the wrong angle. People aren't upset that asset safety exists under that circumstance, people are that if the structure is destroyed absolutely nothing drops. I don't see any problem with allowing asset safety from structures currently alive. It makes sense that you can NPCs to move your shit out of a citadel you lack access to for a fee over a month. It does not make sense that they instantaneously move trillions of m3 instantly when a structure explodes.
---
yes but point is you rep ecm ship in a wormhole fight so it doesnt die straight away, with watchlist + fax its very hard to kill ~150k ehp tengu
---
but with meta shift for leshaks and the small ecm strength buff they did it make it stronger
---
Ok, super angry wall of text. I'm not going to read that with capslock and profanity. I get it, you think I am a pvp only guy. Glad I got the stink of my rorqual fleet off me from years gone past. Good luck, hope you find some blood pressure meds.
---
If your position is that nothing in Eve is worthy of a nerf or adustment that's fine. You're allowed to have that position.
---
You definitely need checks on growth. A monopoly is the natural result of capitalism. It's too costly to have competition, so businesses will naturally try to eliminate it -- either by buying it out or resorting to much more nefarious tactics.
---
The entire point of society is to put more emphasis on the group rather than the individual, yet capitalism is all about the individual. "How do *I* make more money," thinks the capitalist. It's the antithesis of society.
---
lol wat
---
i laugh
---
Will it be drifters? I could forsee one of the empire factions going in and mopping it up and creating a pocket of NPC nullsec under their name, but not drifters themselves.
---
Either a troll who understands exactly what he's saying or a clueless grunt who really doesn't know shit about industry.
---
Government raising tax but not doing shit.... just like RL
---
It’s called being a cheerleader to keep their player base optimistic and subscribed.  Companies have been doing that since the start of time. 
---
I doubt that they are actually not telling the truth, but I fully expect they are putting the absolutely best spin on a very small data set and optimistically evaluating the impact of confounding variables like the log in bonus and skills for kills.  
---
In the end, time will clearly show what impact these changes will have.  Sadly, they are doing so many different things all at one time, I have no fricking clue how they will unravel the statistics of it.  Thank god that is not my job.  
---
I actually would really want to know what the devs actually think about all this.  Not hearing much from the usual forward facing devs of late.  I seem to remember someone on that interview saying how much they respect the devs ability to ‘balance ships”.  Good that they are still letting them be in charge of that.
---
Launch One new official server. Not a new for funsies. Not a new PTR an actual new server. No transfers from other ones just a brand new server. Current patch and everything. Just a new one where pilots, corps, and alliances don't have trillions of isk, but a new server to start anew.
---
You fuck off , stuff your pvp up your ass
---
Must be very cool for whoever will have some of their space turned into NPC space
---
Finally someone talking some sense.
---
I enjoy mining and industry and this sounds like pretty much "reeee, muh safety" to me. Overmining absolutely destroys the game and hides the fact that overratting fucked up the whole economy.  
---
If you really feel like it was a yuuuge investment and that you don't get anything frm the game, then maybe it's not mining changes, it's being a total bittervet and you would be better off without it.

Goons 100% would move around the map like a plague of locusts If resource depletion was a thing. 
---
You know how I know?  Because they already have these things called locust fleet.
---
The moons in delve are divided on the member corps there, but querious, period basis, and fountain have sets of moons there.  Every 2 weeks a region's most valuable moons pop all at once, the super fleet moves to defend, and goonswarm rings a dinner bell,  and literally hundreds of rorqs show up to feast on the ore.
---
20-30 moons have all their high and medium quality moongoo ore stripped in around 2-3 hours. 
---
I make roughly 600-1.5b per rorq for 2-3 hours of work. 
---
That'll only expand if resources deplete.

Lol.  Yep. Only possible explanation of less accounts logging in would be bots.  No other reason why someone would skinny down the number of accounts they are running given the current shifting meta.  Maybe there are even a couple of people who actually don’t like the changes. Who knows...
---
Time will tell, but a good guess as to how well things are really working out will be just how many people log on in 3-6 months....at least with any numbers we will ever see.
---
Even more than Citadel skins, I wish we could get faction-thematic Citadel models. A Caldari or Gallente Raitaru, an Amarrian Tatara, Minmatar Keepstar based on the Thukker roving tribal city-ships...

there's project gungnir (http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/Project%20Gungnir.) formed by a couple init corps i guess, but I highly doubt it was due to blackout cause they don't seem to be a bunch of little bitches, nor they would have any added safety in ls anyway to make money v0v
---
It's a combination of several things. One is previous knowledge of the game basics which saves you a lot of time. I'm a bittervet who plays casually as an alpha clone (i originally played 2004-2006, 2 of my characters are from that time), so apart from learning stuff that got added after i left (like wormholes for example), i don't have to spend time learning the basics (making dock/undock bookmarks in major hubs, managing risk, using d-scan and not getting ganked, and so on).
---
The other is just selecting a playstyle and learning as much as you can about it. Read (or watch) a few guides and tutorials before jumping in.
---
Finally, the single biggest opportunity for profit is game changes. Whenever something gets buffed or nerfed, it affects demand, which affects market prices. Whenever something new is added to the game, the opportunities are even better.
---
I had 2 billion on my exploration alt (the newest of my 3 characters, played him for about 6 months and then i stopped again) and 700 million on my old trading alt during the last Xmas season. I got that 2 bil by initially doing relic sites in wormholes (here's where previous experience paid off, as i started WH diving just a day after i rolled my explo alt), using the isk from that to get into a VNI and running event sites for accelerators, using those profits to get into a gila and runmore event sites, switching to hisec combat sites (and escalations) in an out of the way hisec pocket without a lot of competition, and rounding it all out with a bit of trading and manufacturing (mostly rigs, if you want to make something that will always sell it's rigs, because they get destroyed so much, you can't reuse them once you fit them on a ship). So i got bored again, it was summer and stopped playing.
---
Fast forward a few months and i thought i'd try out abyssal sites with my explo alt. I took a look at some guides, saw the fits and realized that it was both skill intensive and risky for my character to do.
---
So i got on my trading alt and instead of farming the loot myself, i parked in Jita 4-4 and had other people farm the loot for me. I set up buy orders to buy abyssal loot from site runners, then i resold the same items to other people. I made a few hundred million trading filaments, then i upgraded to more expensive stuff. I started trading mutaplasmids and then got into skillbooks. These were the most profitable, because they had a good supply, high demand, quick turnover and big profit margins. For example, kikimoras were very popular at the time. I was approximately doubling my money for every precursor destroyer skillbook i bought and resold (and seeing 30-70% profits on the other triglavian ship skillbooks as well). On a bad day, i was making 100 mil in a few hours while watching netflix. On a good day i would make more than 500 mil.
---
I also rounded this out by running some courrier contracts. There were certain jobs with high collaterals that paid well for only a few jumps and they were very low m3 (usually abyssal loot or blueprints most of the time), so you could easily do them in properly tanked and fast-aligning ships that alpha clones can use. For example, i've made 300 million in a few minutes by making 3 such runs from jita to perimeter (1 jump route).
---
Keep in mind, the market on abyssals had already dropped in value (i think the abyss was launched last august and i got into the whole thing last December) and i was doing this as an alpha clone in an NPC corp, which significantly gimps you with a load of extra taxes (due to the NPC corp tax rates and the limited trade skills available to alphas). I believe that if i had gotten into it back in August when they abyss expansion launched  and if i had gone omega for a month at the beginning (i had pre-trained trade skills from back in the day, so they would go active as soon as i went omega), i would probably be sitting on 30 billion or even more right now.

Gf look forward to the next.
---
Lowest you can go after the next round of eve online: fuck you capsuleers expansion is gonna be 2.5%
---
we need to overthrow the caldari government so we can have free trade in jita.
---
no taxation without representation!
---
They're just action figures.
---
Nothing against Falcon on a personal matter but I completely disagree on many choices CCP made during the last years which are destroying Eve
---
* injectors
---
* keepstars
---
* doing everything to limit legit isk farming for newbies or people with subcap (nerfing DED, VNI changes, blackout) hiding behind the risk adverse narrative, when it's crystal clear that all of this is made to force people to get isks by plex.
---
I won't say that CCP should be a no profit company or playing Eve is a universal right, but until now CCP had a balanced behavior between business and gameplay, now Eve it's a giant mess and CCP is working in a total disrespectful way towards it's customers.
---
Time to live in WHs forever.

"Laughs in wealth": muhahahah
---
1) All is well
---
2) We (CCP or maybe Hillmar and Falcon) are very excited about our new changes and all the numbers we want to share are wonderful.  In fact the best numbers.  They could not be any better.  
---
3) NPE sucks.  We were better when we just threw people in a ship and said FU.  We pretty much don’t capture anyone that actually bothers to try out game.  
---
4) we will do even more random stuff at a rapid pace before really seeing if that last stuff actually worked....but trust us.  It will be the best stuff.  Never seen better.  
---
I am sure I missed some things though.
---
Quoting Hilmar from *this very interview*;
---
"Bots were affected massively by the blackout, although they are changing tactics, CCP will keep focusing on botters and making life uncomfortable for them."
---
ALSO! A lot of older players returned because of blackout confirmed in the data. 
---
Again, this is mentioned in the interview. Go listen to it before commenting, holy shit
---
In fact, they even - early on - say this: "We're actually experiencing right now in the month of July, MAU and DAU the highest it's ever been in the last five years"
---
Yes we don't know how numbers will be in the long run. But as it is CURRENTLY;
---
**LESS bots**
---
**MORE ACTIVE players**
---
**Old players returning**
---
*ALL OF THIS IS CONFIRMED IN THE INTERVIEW*
---
&gt;I have ended up leaving my current Corp thou as it seems more filled with half retired bitter vets than folks who actively play the game but I'm still wary of the big four beginner corps simply due to the size of them.
---
You know you can try them, and if you don't like them, just leave. None of the big newbie corps have penalties for dropping corp.
---
Most of them (all of them?) will hand you free ships and have people willing to answer questions constantly, along with fleets designed to train newbies on different aspects of the game.
---
I mean, do what you want, not everyone enjoys the same things or same environments. I play with Pandemic Horde because there's no content requirements and people are friendly. And I enjoy PvP, and Horde *always* has PvP available. And if I wanna do something else when there's a big fleet going on, that's fine, no problem.
---
I just wouldn't write them off before you try them. If you'd rather do something else, do something else, but I'd at least give one of them a shot before you spend all your Eve time getting frustrated ratting in high/low sec or (even worse) mining/mission running in high. And if you decide you hate it, fly your stuff out and drop corp.
---
I don't know much about them but if you're looking for the smaller end of the big corps I hear Brave has a much more "small group" feel...I've only been in Eve University (good but can be frustrating due to high sec wars, plus it's in high sec mostly) and PH for the big newbie groups.
---
I'm not only saying this because I enjoy being in one of the big blocs, but also because I've won Eve (quit the game) numerous times and every time it was either due to some RL event or high sec. Mostly the latter.
---
Or use the search bar on the upper left corner :D
---
They'll finish it with the same patch that brings us shield slaves, alliance bookmarks, and logi on killmails
---
Separate annd easier editing (and saving) of the overview/D-scan/brackets/ship tags.
---
Multiple clones in one station, clone transport.
---
Clone simulation in ghost-fitting.
---
Keybindings for different ammo types.
---
Lock for the UI (no more accidently draging the drone window over the overview)
---
I'd add onto that a keyboard as well. I've been using a keyboard for the last 2 weeks and playing Eve is so much better!
---
"a bunch"
---
That is because the amount of people that have capitals is too damn high.
---
Sounds out of my price range
---
A fifty year old joke made you choke on your food?
---
Nour Samy.  Trying to FC, despite being logged out, off comms, and in bed.
---
shutupandtakemymoney.jpg
---
Aww yeah dude let’s spacestead in WH space! Down with tyranny!
---
Oh man a libertarian Corp would be kinda funny. We just stockpile weapons and don’t PVP anyone in our WH until they shoot at us.
---
Just get me the Drifter LP Store ... Drifter BS BPC plz!
---
I like using a controller better honestly
---
Amarr is constantly going t5 atm I mean if it was to switch to where minnie was I'd say go that way.
---
Will they be able to afford more router fluid for null sec gates?
---
The solution of course...a new launcher without a player number displayed.  :-)
---
Which is nothing because blackout.
---
Eve online the banana republic of the hardcore mmo universe.
---
Tanked about half as much as every other Nid that died today.  
---
Hmm.
---
Adapt and group together to kill the null blocs keepstar.
---
Nullsec should be dangerous and sinister. Nullsec should not be you losing everything you worked for because your wife was in a car accident and you're spending every evening by her hospital bed.
---
Nullsec should be scary and unpredictable. Nullsec should not be you losing everything you worked for because your mental health just took a giant shit and you can't bring yourself to spend hours at the computer doing logistics runs.
---
Nullsec should be challenging but rewarding. Nullsec should not be you losing everything you worked for because your employer just dropped a huge project on your head that needed finishing a week ago.
---
you got blackout wtf you want more from ccp for next few years :-D
---
You are wrong. If you have a income of 1000 $ you get hurt by 5% universal tax cause you haven´t room in your budget. You wanna get your money togehter and probaly won´t have much left at the end of the month. If you have an income of 10000 $ you can plan easily with the 5% universal tax. Because you have room to breath in your budget.
---
I don’t use any of these functions lol. Typically know where I’m going. The locals in my hunting grounds know me on a first name basis ;D
---
I have to agree and give huge props to /u/ccp_falcon. Regardless of if you like / dislike the changes (I personally like) the fact is that we have someone communicating with the community which is something we've been screaming about needing for ages. 
---
Thanks for stepping up and sharing your thoughts. Increased communication allows a lot more good will to CCP then silence.
---
I suggest you just save your money for when your local tax agency fucks you.
---
Arf, i laugh ;/
---
Nour Samy
---
Now that's a name I haven't heard for a long time.
---
* Logout to character selection screen.
---
* Queue next activated ability so you don't have to spam and hope lag doesn't cause you to turn the module right off again
---
* Hotkeys for specific overview tabs
---
* Take all "item hanger" actions, such as selling/contracts/reprocessing/etc., from containers
---
* Alternative to previous: allow creating item folders instead of using station containers or a million nested filters for item organization
---
I do button in the fitting simulation so I don’t have to scroll through 400 modules to find the one I accidentally removed.
---
Blue donut is bad
---
Bounties are payments for services rendered so the fat factionistas can sit in relative safety while capsuleers risk ships and isk to curb the more violent factions in New Eden from running roughshod through HigheSec.  It's almost like the Factions don't want our help anymore?
---
Can I have your stuff if you quit?
---
Hilamr seems to have an acute inability to see how EvE players will react to his changes.
---
Wow. So....just game knowledge and knowing how to leverage what u know. Thanks. I always thought there was some secret that i was missing. Turns out i just wasnt digging deep enough.
---
Are you retarded
---
But why do you want to nerf that?
---
I thought this was /r/libertarian for a second
---
It's not an "I Win" button, it's an "I'm going to force you to counter-escalate or I win button." These types of escalations are a large part of the Eve meta.
---
It gets really frustrating when these groups are attacking groups that can't counter escalate. So I sympathize. However, this is how Eve is played. 
---
If you can't counter escalate your best bet is to find friends who can.
---
Sin doing what sin does best.
---
CCP has show yet again that a good chunk of Eve players are total whores for free SPs.....now all they are trying to establish is how much they will have to pay to keep them to keep logging in and subscribed.
---
Flair check out
---
I'd say Nour Samy is a retard, but I don't want to insult mentally retarded people like that.
---
Nope I,l biomass before I give you my shit you filthy beggar lol 
---
And cashing in my assets are hardly quitting.
---
Another mechanic to learn in the new player experience. Judging by the interview they are trying to reduce initial mechanics(?) difficulty.
---
More likely they'll create new space and have it sprawl over the dronelands.
---
what mechanics? its not difficult, its just fucking boring. everyone i've tried to get into eve got bored within 5 minutes. point and click, wooo!
---
There is not really a blue donut in wh.
---
People will shoot at each other, and if the next one is getting evicted they will come to help, the only bloque most wh corps are alt’s corps
---
recreational doomsday weapons are bloc weapons and never intended to be held by the factional warfare militia.
---
reeee
---
It's so strange to see that book not read "sekrit dokuments"
---
Wait I thought all carriers came stock with a cyno...
---
Albion and Eve share a lot of the same player base.
---
It all goes back in the box.
---
You can totally take down your houses and still get at least half value back.
---
Or you could use distribution,
---
For every 1 rorq being shot by 100 bombers there are 99 rorqs somewhere being shot by 0 bombers.
---
Fair point. I still believe that a spooling up period or some other counter such as a bubble to locally inhibit cynos would maintain the mechanic while introducing counters that are not absolute. 
---
Perhaps my thinking will evolve as time goes on.
---
It teaches people that universal basic income is awesome. Everyone wants to go past Go.
---
I don't see how integrating it directly would at all be easier than a notepad.
---
BRUUHHHHHH I’m literally dealing with the IRS stealing my tax refunds.
---
I love this meme. Thank you. ❤️
---
I assume they mean as a target...
---
Well, people didn't like the "real" ruleset.
---
They liked the monopoly ruleset because you could fuck your friends without consent.
---
They brought drifters to nullsec
---
They took away local.
---
Now all they need is to take asset safety and respawning sites away and the null blocks might be pissed enough to just evict every wormhole in existence to show them what it’s like to truly lose what they built due to dev choices
---
In this situation you MJD out. With damps you can still lock close range. If you're in a cruiser fighting three frigs you should probably lose anyways. Bc and bs solo should always have MJD for avoiding long range tackle. If you're long scrammed by a faction pimped Arazu out of neut/lock range then that's just the way she goes, at least they have to commit the pimp and ship and not just a fucking tech I Griffin.
---
You're right, what has capitalism ever done for us? Obviously any nation that tries it would fail horribly.
---
&gt; 02:25 - **Hilmar**:  "We're actually experiencing right now in the month of July, MAU and  DAU the highest it's ever been in the last five years" - (DAU/MAU =  Daily/Monthly active users). 
---
I'm SURE that has nothing to do with the gobs of free SP they're handing out, or the (probably short-lived) novelty of the blackout.
---
The fact that they not only did they start TWO free sp events along with the blackout, but pointed to user count during those SP events as an indication of the "success" of the blackout and an indication that they should continue along that line, pretty clearly indicates that they are more interested in pushing their own agenda than in the interests of their playerbase or improving the success of the game.
---
It's both hilarious and sad how badly a game company that markets its game as a "sandbox" fails to understand what a sandbox IS.  If you REALLY want EVE to be a sandbox, stop punishing players for not playing the way you think they should, and instead create new opportunities for unique, or at least different, gameplay. 
---
You also might want to start soliciting user opinions somewhere other than the echo chamber that is Reddit. (no, the simple upvote / downvote thing ingame doesn't really qualify)
---
5x HAMs, 2 Bonused neuts that equal three mediums, and a cloak.
---
They announced the next wave at EVE North. Iirc it was hardners plates extenders and batteries. Likely to go in tandum with shield and cap recharge rebalance
---
As compared to 1% before.
---
There never was 0%
---
It's uncle sam, not the jewish man caricature.
---
if they add a Null NPC region in the droneland thats like a nerf to Panfam right ?   
---
they should increase the range between a NS NPC and the other NS beign able to hide a dreadcache in just 1 NPC station and no one can do anything is shit, just buff the black ops for that a HIC blackops &lt;3
---
Why? What does it matter? I didn't even know they put taxes up 2 years ago...
---
he can go fuck himself tbh
---
and i thought, init would be one of the better goonsigs...
---
[But you have heard of him](https://tenor.com/view/pirates-of-the-caribbean-johnny-depp-jack-sparrow-but-you-have-heard-of-me-heard-of-me-gif-4783699)
---
This is the same section of the eve website that had the "blackout being indefinite" that /u/ccp_falcon had to discredit as just ingame news and not actually real news
---
How? Don't new people just buy from sell orders and sell to buy orders? That doesn't even get taxed, right? Only traders pay the tax?
---
&gt; Nour Samy. Trying to FC, despite being logged out, off comms, and in bed.
---
Hey man when it works it's the fucking dream. Just call this an impromptu welpfleet and open SRP for everyone
---
I don't understand where you're jumping from a clash in the drone lands to this being an NPC region?
---
I dont get it, it just says the npcs are clashing - why would it turn into NPC Null?
---
You also pay taxes if you sell to buy orders. Even wormholers who sell their blue loot to npc pay taxes.
---
