&gt; I can't think of a larger alliance that *won't* SRP someone in a doctrine fit ship that was participating in a genuine pinged home-save operation.

Brother, I take it you haven't ever been in Horde.

---
It brought me back for a moment. Was fun.
---
See, i *knew* it wasnt 7 fleets!
---
Dunno, we was plexing and they kept coming back for more ass-handing lol

Wow, that's cringeworthy. You, sir, are trying way too hard.
---
Even better, wormholes are tasty morsels.
---
How profitable are we talking?
---
Maybe, but not today &gt;;3
---
We can all smirk at fits but y'all don't know what this MF is goin' through smh
---
Or its been logged off at 0 for a week already

&gt;Meaning that there's very likely a period of vulnerability where you can hit them.
---
This is literally what the thread is about- there isn't.
---
I suggest /r/evejobs if you are looking for a Corp. I'll be watching for a post from you so I can try to poach you, lol. You sound like an asset.
---
Hate to break it to you...
---
A normal well-organised 5 or 6 planet PI setup in null or wh space will make 600m - 800m per month. If you are only getting 200m per month you need to fix your setup.
---
can't do that in low/high sec
---
Nah man, high level f1 and f2 because of that doomsday ability. Very high skill ships
---
Considering the replies in this thread, most people don't pick up on it. It's also not very well explained or documented in-game or even elsewhere.
---
SoonTM with Tiericide. Team Talos is apparently on the job.
---
You won't really "learn" PvP joining a big null alliance. I mean, you'll learn some kind of pvp but judging by how your post sounds you want to actually learn how to fly a ship...
---
In a big bloc null alliance you will learn how to fly the ships they tell you to fly, lock, and press f1 on a broadcasted target. While fleets like this can be ok for some people, others will find it very boring. You'll likely eventually stagnate.
---
If you want to actually learn how to be a good pvp pilot in eve, I will second what others have said here and suggest going to either Faction Warfare lowsec, or find a Wormhole crew to show you the ropes. As a solo pilot, you wont find any good fights in null, but if you think that being in a big fleet of bros and smashing in to other big fleets sounds like fun, give a null alliance like TEST or goons a shot.
---
I think if you bait it out of gate range, it's doable, but if theyre smart they'd sit on gate and just GTFO.
---
only way i see to solo it is with a ikitiki, otherwise you'd need two ships (alphaing it with 2x arty maelstroms could be funny)
---
CCPLS clone swapping in npc stations
---
android ir ios?
---
Yes please come.  Will go well for u
---
I still don't understand how highseccers afford such blingy ships or what they even use them for.
---
This post's only issue is that you didn't right click on Glacial Drift.
---
If you have about 10bn or more to invest, reactioneering is the best isk in the game.
---
Your comment's only issue is that you suggested I should right click on Glacial Drift.
---
:Enter pod skin rant:
---
That was a copy paste from EVE uni, lots of newer players don't understand overheating mechanics very well.
---
Better tell the art and HR teams to start fixing all those programming bugs!
---
Yes!
---
If those toons already have the best skill composition for their SP and task, then you can inject it into any skill. Best use one where you don't need to get a skillbook.
---
If they don't have the best skill composition yet, then inject into the skills you would consider the most useful for them to gain. When you extract, extract those skills which you consider the least useful to them. Sometimes things can be so simple :) You can also consider mapping a bit. For example you are lacking an off map skill on an alt so inject that and extract a skill at the current mapping of the alt.
---
He essentially begs to be scammed.
---
that would be our sigil my friend...and you know exactly witch sigil im talking about. see you in space
---
fuck caps i can only fly enyo
---
I mean I guess I have to try the game to see if I’d even like it. But it certainly intrigues me.
---
Well since this is a sandbox, what are you looking for specifically? There are a LOT of ways we could point you.
---
More like stupid. That's what's shameful. Amazing he got through Uedema.
---
Umm well I just want to get off to a good start, perhaps find a guild that will mentor me so I can eventually get promoted and contribute. I like the idea of logging in and playing a bunch of time every single day....   does that help?

You can adjust your window transparency and make it black.
---
You just go through a gate, that's how you get into low sec and nullsec.
---
Or scan a wormhole to go into wormhole space.

It is entirely possible to earn enough ingame moneys to pay for the subscription that way, but it would just be senseless grinding. So yeah paying money for the subscription is worth it. Or you can just try out as a free account, to see how it feels. Other than that, I've never seen any need to put any extra money in. Except maybe if there's like a crazy good Black Friday deal or something.
---
this is common bullshit indeed.
---
stratops which you and many of you calls as f1 monkey fest, is not that often and not really how you imagine it at all.
---
90% of the time you want to spend in fleets are small roams/ops which you have to know how to fly what are you flying not to mention killing visitors in your space on daily basis solo or with 2-3 another dudes.
---
But as far as I can understand this subreddit, everyone hates nullsec blocks but yet everyone knows exactly how everyeach of them works .... miracle
---
Pay $$ for Omega, but don't both paying any $$ for anything else till you really know stuff (you might find you want to buy some plex/sell it for ISK at some point) TBH part of the initial fun is figuring out a lot of things and making your own money. Obvs easy thing is try for free account then pay, though if you have the money it isn't much of a deal to pay for 3 months of sub to get a proper feel :)
---
This keeps happening I might give CCP money again
---
The same thing happened to me, 
---
If you're Windows 10 you can try the following:
---
1. Minimize all windows using the "Win+M" combination
---
2. Restore all windows using "Win+Shift+M" combination
---
This did the trick for me at least.
---
You're right. With corp friendly fire set as legal, you can attack corp members without concord getting involved. Takes 24 hours to take effect. Looks like ill be giving smart bomb ratting a try tomorrow, will let you know how it goes
---
yes i have
---
I'll probably give it a whirl tomorrow
---
IOS limits the number of downloads for beta tests. You might be able to find another way to get the app but IOS is out of my wheelhouse.
---
Join Goonswarm, we're a quite active bunch and PvP is a given. Also since our SRP is so great you make more ISK loosing your ship in fight than its worth so you never need to krab again!
---
[&gt; Our response fleet had to form up and be ready to ~~fight~~ never undock again.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditSimulator/comments/4u7xyq/my_friend_made_me_a_quick_rundown_on_the_command/d5nkz9d/)
---
expendable income - ie. only buy skill injectors from the market. never FROM someone.
---
Sounds like you're better off being banned.
---
What's not to believe? You were raging. But, also- you might benefit from some time away from this  game. Your mental and physical well being are more important than what the game provides, which is escapism. If you took it this hard, it's ok and probably a good thing to step back for a bit.
---
Wait what? You *asked* CCP to ban your accounts?
---
I will stop playing for a while, I just wanted a chance to return
---
yes. the ultimate rage quit.
---
We will still be jumping home by then :/
---
~600mil per alt is what I made in the last 30 days, 5 characters running 25 wh planets in a "work in progress" setup with plenty of room for optimisation when I find the time. Finding a planet composition that provides the right resources in balanced quantities is key here.
---
I mean it also did good DPS for a cruiser, and has selectable damage type.
---
It sounds like you need to take a break from the game, if it becomes that serious.
---
I like the idea but how should they appraise limited items like BPCs, Abyssal mods, Skins etc.. Especially since those are the items the hypernet was primarily made for. (Apart from being a massive ISK sink)
---
I'm sure they will work with you on it. If you still need a gaming outlet that doesn't place a strong attachment to material goods and permanent loss, there are tons of tank and ship and fps type battle royales. Or- take up a different hobby for a bit. As silly as it sounds, plants/gardening/animals all require some care and maintenance and can be very rewarding.
---
I didn't realize you could do that. A more effective way to rage quit would be to biomass your characters. Also, I don't see why CCP would *not* unban your account(s). After all, they are trying to make money. Unless you committed a bankable offense, they should unban you (pure speculation -- I don't actually know).
---
They're called drones, not bots, so you're good. :tapping_forehead:
---
eve is the only thing that I cared about is my life
---
Please don't have kids. you can't have those banned. and you probably shouldn't' throw them either.
---
I’m not sure if sharing the answer breaks TOS but they did
---
you can also try the sites out on the test server and save yourself a possibly embarrassing km. ;)
---
i don’t want kids
---
Yes!!! This would make the pod skins not completely worthless.
---
So it's about numbers basically.  People like to say mining isnt free, theres opportunity cost.  But the main fallacy is that opportunity cost assumes you make the best use of your time so if you arent going to do anything more productive with your time, then mining is free.  
---
So same thing here, if goal is to make isk/hr then you're better off spending a few B and never fail.  Otherwise, each time you fail, you also lost out on the loot and such so the "cost" is more than the ship.  
---
But if you're having fun messing around with builds and such and isk/hr isnt your goal, then it's ok.
---
Can confirm, quit last summer after about a year of being mostly afk.
---
Even *if* they do actually hate you currently that's not something that is immutable. If you don't like the fact they hate you then that gives the start of what you need to work with them to fix that.
---
Give it a try, approach them honestly, openly and without being confrontational.
---
Take a break from eve friend. It's a game and reacting like that to a game isnt healthy in short or long term
---
Honestly, over the years I've found that to get the most fun out of the game, you need to do minimal grinding (Unless you happen to actually enjoy a grindy activity).
---
I pay for the sub with $$$, and then do passive industry activities such as planetary interaction and manufacturing to bolster my wallet, and occasionally buy a PLEX with real $$$ and sell it ingame for ISK.
---
As long as I don't go crazy with the PvP spending, I'm usually alright.
---
Needs more up-doots
---
Like i said i had the same issue. With some trial and error i found out that linking the killmail uploads it as well (after clicking it in the chat ofc). Or what do you mean by "where"?
---
Last night I was having this problem, after about 2 hours all the kills finally loaded in.
---
Honestly any Online game with an economy has a bot problem.
---
Everyone hold on gate at 0, DO NOT AGGRESS...
---
:eyeroll:
---
Yeah, they shoot fish in a barrel and think they are great fishermen... Sad.
---
 so far last week hull  from that build and running t4s any of them at random and a shit ton of any t5s we find in the t4s live on stream we cleared with one shit build Gila lost 2.43 bill we did about 2 hours a day in there for like 5 days - 300 mill for the one loss  All in All OP Success o7

Jesus, majority of his posts are just him crying about something and raging his tits off. He is one angry little 15 year old.

We've been trying to hide that from you but since you've found it I guess you're one of us now
---
move to provi and join the standing fleet
---
Really liked that answer. I'm jealous to be USTZ now lol
---
And then laugh when the bee breaks it's wrist from the recoil of a weapon used improperly with only 1 hand?
---
Are there a lot of grind? Is it a bad idea starting this now as a total beginner?
---
How about a filter to eliminate all local spam that mentions hypernet?
---
Why did Chaotic Dark Filament prices skyrocket?
---
I bought like 15 a week ago at something like 1 or 2 mil ISK a pop, now they're suddenly 18+mil
---
I am cool with this.
---
Which cable company does your character work for?
---
vedmak is the only problem I see with it but it won't matter since if he pulls range, he'll warp off when the rest die.  So you might miss out on some loot but nothing else really.
---
&gt;playing the game as it's designed
---
you can make more apm intensive activities that pay more, so your entire point is null
---
Can't tell the difference from the normal sub really.
---
lmao
---
Its aight, MCAV is already got more enyos and we're back to business as usual.
---
&amp;#x200B;

P.S. Mcav is recruiting \\o/

German victory at stalingrad?

Yeah I instantly got a downwote for this tip hahha

---
In general perhaps, but things change somewhat when you're at war with somebody for this long. We've been fighting this war for going on two years now, and any notion of a "good fight" went out the window a long time ago.
---
Neither side holds anything back anymore. If they leave themselves open to a whelping, we will provide it. As would they.
---
Mate, this is RC we're talking about, normally they won't even undock if they don't out number us, turn about is fair play.
---
imagine being provi, calling a cta for 20 rni's and morale posting on reddit about it lmao
---
Reload antimatter
---
you know you can use faxes too right
---
also you didn't answer his question
---
&gt; Get over yourself.
---
Never count on that one. You’re going to be cold in the ground before that is going to happen and even then it won’t happen.
---
What you want is an imagination. Something you lack and that is why you want the stupid and the ridiculous.
---
What you really want is some kind of service that allows you to swap one set of implants for another. Because the intention of implants has always been that once removed they are permanently destroyed.
---
A new feature / module would, at appropriate cost, allow you to swap out head metal such that you could have several sets in a station and use the new feature to swap out one set for another. This would be costly, but that would be the point.
---
You don’t arrive at those kinds of solutions because, frankly, that’s you. Your family doesn’t hold the spittle pan underneath your chin for no reason. Or, as someone I knew in a former life used to say: you can lead a horse to water but you can’t make a duck out of it.
---
/it’s extremely annoying to have to hand you guys solutions to problems you have but can’t formulate an answer for.
---
Pfff
---
I think previous winners were selected by a small group of TIS guys / FCs
---
PvP as a noob is a lot like running a foot race against Olympic athletes. The only way you can win is if everyone else is drunk, high, or sleeping.
---
file a ticket telling ccp to disable your use to hypernet and send them this picture you posted. you have a problem.
---
ok then
---
just wish CCP had used some creative commons or public domain music....
---
Awesome.
---
First time, worked fine for me, really cool idea! More of this plz CCP :D (if you can do birthday ones that would be amazing?)
---
Gonna take a wild guess that he meant to hit the rorq and finish it off lol ... No idea on the why? But maybe something to do with the disturbing fit, I'll never understand some people lol, every group that has rorqs has at least one.  Tank on these things is so powerful with the high resists/massive Indy core bonused reps.... Why you would ever put an extender on when it equals like 2-3 shield rep cycles that u could have instead....idk.
---
Procurer was doing the below of my ass
---
so we know eve has at least 214k subscribers during last year at various points.
---
Thanks anyways! Its a great idea! :)
---
The music got claimed on the YouTube video :P
---
It needs more people in the market. 5k transactions put you in the top 5% or so.
---
Also needs more missioners, 140 missions got top 25%
---
Seddow probably deserves the player of the year. Driving force in TEST / Legacy flipping 5+ regions of space.
---
VOLTA probably gets group of the year. They went from quiet to filling the boogeyman's shoes with a big boost in members and some absolutely deadly fleets that are basically the only thing seriously pressuring super umbrellas right now. They're spooky as shit in the same way that people were scared of Snuffed Out dreadbombs.
---
Ah ok, noted! Sorry about that. We'll see what we can do next time.
---

---
Can you repeat the question?
---
Where do these come from?
---
Did I get one, too?
---
Beltalowda...new style.
---
o7 thanks for the hard work this year! Looking forward to next year.
---
probably because Meiqur is on eve holiday. I did expect a smug Reddit post from him. but i tried to tell radioactive not to be so dramatic its just one of those swings one side or the other happens to hit.
---
stop bombing yourself
---
Double check your spam folders and make sure the email didn't end up there. After that think back - did you unsubscribe from EVE Online emails at some point this year? If not check out the [dev blog](https://www.eveonline.com/article/q3cdqi/your-year-in-eve-video-data) and make sure there's nothing else there that might have disqualified you.
---
If after all that you still think you should have received something then... I'm sorry. :/ For whatever reason you didn't get a video. We tried super hard not to exclude anyone who was really working hard in EVE this year but with over 200,000 emails sent there might have been a few people who slipped through the cracks. I hope we can do better for you next year.
---
Intel thread lol
---
Great idea.... EXcePt h0w FucKiNG AnnoYing iT wAs!!!
---
This was really awesome to see. A shame that I got the PvP reward instead of PvE because I am a total mission runner carebear, but attended a lot of Bombers Bar fleets. Still though, a lot of fun to watch and the stats were great.
---
check your spam folder, Jin'taan's got sent there. That is if you met the criteria
---
Top 25%. You have to be mad active dude
---
Yeah, I think I logged in like &lt;20 times this year lmao
---
no, never, not ever....
---
The EVE equivalent of shooting the hostage. Keanu would be proud.
---
Which racial cruiser should I train to V next? I got Gallente cruiser to V a couple of years ago in preparation for flying a Proteus but then left eve for a while. Apparently it's shit now so I don't think there's a point in training the rest of the Gallente T3C skills. 
---
The Loki seems to be the most versatile T3C at the moment (correct me if I'm wrong), so I'm leaning towards training Minmatar cruisers next. On the other hand, Amarr has some damn sexy ships...
---
What are some currently commonly used T2 cruisers that I might want to keep in mind beyond the T3Cs?
---
That's amazing! Hope you feel better soon and also play EVE some more. ;)
---
Lol, cause that would make it way better!!!! Not.
---
LOL not much incentive there to not answer yes  LOL
---
You can certainly PVP, but if you solo with newbie skills you are likely to lose the vast majority of fights you take.
---
Holy shit
