I run Eve quite well on medium graphics, using the GPD MicroPC. It is a "laptop" that's 6.1 inches long. 
---

---
You don't *need* a dedicated GPU to run Eve, but it helps. 
---
That said, this game will literally run on a particularly well-fertilized potato.
---
---
---
Platinum highly appreciated! Yes, I devoted 5 years of my life to her. In that time they nerfed suicide ganking repeatedly, they made EVE free to play, they made it possible to extract and sell skill points, they failed to combat the resultant botting epidemic, they started handing out skill points like candy to anyone who consistently logged in, they created "asset safety", and "fozziesov", they screwed up lowsec with publicly tetherable citadels, they sold out to the Koreans, they started promoting lame PvE events, they reassigned their core developers, they spent all their profits on a string of failed games, they laid off the community team, they cancelled the alliance tournament, and they bowed to a new generation of overly-entitled softies with no patience and no ability to appreciate delayed gratification. Enough was enough.
---
"responsibly"?
---
By keeping it secret (for the public) and let some people exploit it till it gets fixed eventually? Nah man, make it public and CCP has way more pressure to act/fix it!
---
Eve like nothing else out there, and people will be having detailed and intelligent discussions about it's impact years after it fades away.
---
It's worth playing for that reason alone.
---
&gt; Even our die-hard PVPers are getting exhausted as we ping for a defense fleet several times an hour. 
---
This is the problem right here. Forming sucks. Getting pinged, stopping whatever you were doing, and going off on a likely futile quest to save someone sucks! But in my experience the part of this that actually sucks is the part that leads up to being in a defense fleet, not the part where you're already formed up and in the defense fleet.
---
So skip a few steps. Have a standing defense fleet. Practice your (insert speed benchmark here) readiness. Pay your defenders for their time. For that matter, there's really no reason to keep the fleet docked up if it's subcaps. Run sites in your staging with the defense fleet.
---
It's a tedious mechanic, it is unnecessarily complicated for new players, and remapping is pointless unless you're going to train skills with the same two primary and secondary attributes and only those skills for an entire year.
---
🤜🤛
---
Null sec krabs to fund their war efforts. Without out isk there are no ships to blow up. It's not that hard of a concept to grasp

None, unless you want to become an F1 monkey

This should have ended after the 4th line
---
Lol someone is salty
---
Yeah, I've tried. I can give more info if it's helpful. Android doesn't tell me why it's not supported. Are you able to determine what is required in order for the app store too say it's compatible? It surely must take other information into account beyond just the Android version.
---
Wow thats some basic level shit that everyone already knows fuckwit.

---
Right now your model number and Android version which you've provided is probably enough. Thanks.

Quit now while you still can.
---
&gt; Oh wow okay got damn. So we're better now then where we were at?
---
No, and jintaan didn't say this, anyone suggesting such would probably get a public shit-stomping. The study has refutable conclusions that don't hold true in todays EVE such as the fact that content updates demonstrably do effect subscription growth. (but at the time it rang true) 
---
So when you ruin the game, people do stop subbing extra accounts or even primary accounts. The study is useless at best in the population/retention discussions that have been commonplace at reddit recently, but it was very valid and interesting at its time of publication in 2007.
---
Hey what's it like living under a government that grinds political dissidents into paste with tanks?
---
I went beyond hate and now I just don't care, he became GoonLineMember#52613 and thus completely irrelevant.
---
Read: The same study today would have different results. It's more interesting than explicitly useful for reddits population/sub/wellness discussions.

I found the fat dino logo on Test wiki which was added on there at 2016/06/24  but I can't find who actually designed and give the person the credit he/she/it deserve.

Can't Install on Android 5.1 Moto E2 from Google Play Store or APK. What phone specs are needed to run the app?

Do you know [Dreddit is Recruiting?](https://dredditisrecruiting.com/)
---
Ya, I’m having some issues with the app. I can’t seem to use the app to play with my PP. Are we seriously calling it PP now?
---
Yes it is.
---
The Steam numbers only show users logged in through Steam.
---
However, keep in mind, EVE Online is a single shard. Everyone is playing in the same sandbox.

Nah we good fam

There's another thing you can do, and that's push your lower-SP explorers and such INTO the WHs. Also, PVP inside the WHs. Because content on that side keeps them away from content on your side.
---
Unfortunately, WHs are owned by so many different people in different time zones and you never know what is going to roll into you. It isn't an easy thing to battle, but people love a good fight. With that much action, I would think it easy to recruit in more PVP-minded people.
---
Everyone docks up sometimes. It happens. Just sucks being the person who is out there and gets steam-rolled as a warning, which happened to me back when I was in NS. WH people usually don't have numbers like NS does either. They are limited by the mass on the WH, and that's why critting rather than crushing is the best policy. Either way, you should be able to field more bodies, though WH ISK may mean they have blingy things... and they fight more often and have some experienced FCs. The weaker WH groups may also be the most dangerous, as they get stomped often by C5 or C6 Corps in WH, and look to stomp ratting Nullbears any chance they can. Just don't be stompable, that's all you can try to do.
---
Good luck and fly safe.
---
Should have got the betamax bro. Works on that.
---
But the real question is, why does 50% of "players" quit before the 1st log in.
---
Have your line members rat in high sec, that way you don't have targets in your own space and you can hunt other people's targets without risking your own ships to imbalanced mechanics.
---
The shit talking started with "free Hong Kong" and someone taking offense and it just went downhill from there xD
---
None of it was meant to be taken seriously though, just some harmless after faeces flinging.
---
Seems to work smoothly, and I'm on a pretty low end phone too.
---
The sad fact is that CCP can not buff null ratting safety without making bots/blobs too safe in their perspective. For example, what if say, forsaken rally points and below were protected by an acceleration gate. Forsaken rally points don't have terrific isk/hour, and supers/carriers don't run them. Gating them would make them subcap only, which creates a lower risk but also lower reward activity for alliances who can't cyno an umbrella.
---
However, these sites now become too safe for bots, who can mash Dscan and dock up the instant a non-botting type ship appears on Dscan.
---
Hi! I don't know the Talwar, but a propmod like an afterburner or microwarp drive is very common in the mids. Mwd is much faster, but makes you easier to shoot. (Increases your signature radius)
---
Also, have you heard of Meta modules? There is a sneaky module attribute called "Meta level", which is distinct from "tech level". The tech levels are 1 or 2, and the 2s have a little yellow 2 in the corner of the icon and take extra skills to use. Meta levels go from  0 to sometimes around 10. 
---
The higher the meta level, generally speaking,  the more expensive the module is but the more damage it does, or the faster it goes, or whatever that module is for. 
---
Check [this link](http://eve-wiki.net/index.php?title=Light_Missile_Launcher) for an example on your light missile launchers. You want the Meta4 "Arbalest" launchers if you can afford them. On the chart, you can see that they shoot faster, hold more missiles between reloaded, and take less CPU and POWER GRID to fit on your ship.
---
This is what wormholers do tbh, it's fun day tripping into someone's sov and snatching a few kills then running back and rolling the wormhole. There's no real way to defend against it but to scan the wormholes and put a scout on entry. However this requires a ton of manpower, something that you don't have. Just tell your guys to be alert.
---
Ok the feedback ive gotten is positive, so ill give it a try. Anybody have a referral link they want me to use.
---
Yes, just be aware that many players do not play through steam. Try the game out.
---
lool
---
naisuu
---
ill warn him :3
---
Maybe consider that this group might only be averaging 50m isk/hour on average subcap ratting/mining, vs 500/hour in holes. If they welp even something cheap like Feroxes that's an hour of ratting to replace the ship. Welp more than once per day and that's too much time spent replacing lost ships to fight.
---
You cant warp 30km, to be warpable something must be 150km or further from you.
---
I meant within 30 km of something AU away
---
Gotcha, so you bumped then?
---
Well I didn't get to see what happened, I was panicking and got pretty much one shot in less than 5 seconds
---
that joke went way over his head lol
---
It ain't just Reddit, that's the prevailing EVE mindset for the last 10 years.. hence the shakeup.
---
Keep at it!  You’ll get it all back in short order and be more prepared the next time.  Highly recommend having some drones out while working at a site uncloaked.  An orbiting drone might buy you a just enough extra time to bug out depending on what their decloak plan is.
---
The only problem of equipping an afterburner or micro-warpdrive is that it takes up way too much of my CPU. I also don't want to use up a rig slot for a CPU Overclocker. Do I have to just level up skills, or is there a better way? Like taking Auto-Repeat off...
---
Probably bumped.  Where you "touching noses" with the node you were hacking?  Stabs reduce lock range as well as increase lock time.  With 4 of them you'd almost have to be on top of the can.
---
Thanks for the spirit. Also what drones? I'm sure I will make it back, I even got 500mil from a very kind CEO in my Alliance, It only bothers me how much time I wasted by making these stupid mistakes
---
I mean if you liek not having targets. I'll enjoy blowign you up if you even step a foot in delve
---
I had just taken the loot so I was 1000m away from the can when I hit warp out. Seconds Later I was gone. I never stood a chance against that Loki anyways..
---
https://youtu.be/DeLMIrsEfFo
---
Lol 50/hr lololol
---
my post was a link, you should have been able to click it. could you not?
---
You can, but ship+item hangar has a combined limit of 1k. Basically 1k individual lines.
---
When each one of our doctrines have around ~25+ modules+cargo on average. So each ship I repackage becomes 26. I'm sure you can imagine even mass repackaging takes a good amount of time when you're doing this with ~4k hulls (a little more than) it takes a really long time repackaging them about 25-30 hulls at a time, then their modules, then stacking and dragging over to a hulls/fittings container over and over and over again.
---
Yea that makes sense, although I kind of disagree with the logic. (Everyone single person could just reach out to the member that came after them).  But that was why I suggested a smaller corp anyway.
---
Go setup in a wormhole.
---
I dont get the sentiment of balancing null around small groups. That's what lowsec and wormholes are for. People enjoy being apart of empires and being in a blob. Let us have our game to.
---
Big word hard. Me understand. Me talk simple for you.
---
**You dumb.**
---
Games isnt dieing its doing fine. Get on oearn a ship and bam bam. Lets go
---
PI is dead.
---
PP forever.
---
I think he was taking the piss :P
---
Ah, yeah that's fucking silly. But also, why are there 4k assembled ships in the first place? Back when I was working test\_free, we only had a few hundred assembled hulls at any time.
---
Regardless, a mass repackage/repair all tool would be neat for this ridiculous case.
---
All four members of NC. that showed up? Seems like you're really stretching that narrative...
---
Just delete charge damage and make lasers use ammo like everything else. Same with mining lasers. Fuck.
---
Not sure what you mean by auto repeat. Shooting missile after missile automatically? They doesn't affect your CPU or POWER GRID. 
---
Fitting is always frustrating on new accounts. There's nothing wrong with using your rig slots for a CPU upgrade. Hell, if you aren't using the lows, pot a CPU coprocessor in there. We have all ALL flown ships with a power grid or cpu module or rig. Hell, implants (under augmentation on you're character sheet) are REQUIRED on some common fits for high level characters, just to get an extra 2% grid. 
---
As far as not fitting an MWD: that's certainly up to you! Afterburner can work, though they're slower. If you intend to keep enemies at your maximum missile range, you will need one or the other though. Sooner or later, an enemy will come chase you and then you're hosed if you can barely move
---
I have no solutions, but thank you for posting. I'm a wormholer, btw, and I KNEW they had to have done something.  Wormholers be rolling on the other end too ya know! Connections EVERYWHERE.
---
honestly why would anybody want dek
---
it's one big long string which is hard to build an umbrella around, which is still the current meta.
---
The same 50m/hr subcap is not making 500m/hr in a WH.
---
CCP said they are looking at wormhole rolling mechanics. Right now wormolers just rageroll a ns static until they find what they want. 
---
After the wormholes mass changes, if CCP don't fuck things up (big if), ragerolling will be harder and riskier, with a non-negligible chance to be stuck on the wrong side of the hole. That's probably the change you're looking for.
---
Thanks all for the sudjestions
---
We had 14 warm bodies. 
---
Nestors were all dual-boxing 2 each.  ✔️ 
---
 At least three of us were triple-boxing.  ✔️ 
---
Most of the DPS were dual-boxing either two DPS or a DPS + HIC.  ✔️ 
---
Not all of the enemy fleet ended up on the KM because reasons I guess.  ✔️
---
Its almost like mass limits and closable space are joke on the game.
---
Well technically you boarded the Hoarder to change the name to **FREE HONG KONG** and then park it on the Astra undock for a laugh.
---
Stratios.
---
Fine, when can I control my PP from my phone?
---
The game is on par with Dwarf Fortress in terms of difficulty.
---
Yes the activity has been nerfed. Excavators are slower and mine much less. Supercarrier fighters dont apply as well. Hell, cynos wont be able to be fitted to any capital anymore.
---
I was thinking about turning off the auto-repeat for the MWD. It takes quite alot of capacitor, so I think I probably will.
---
Doesn’t hunter tengu still exist for blops
---
The mail doesnt work. Freezes when you try to open a mail. Samsung galaxy s10
---
Samsung S7, unsure if running beta version but the one I have runs sweet, looks good - my only gripe is the character select being moved to the final page, liked going in through my character list on launch, as with the last version, no biggy though.
---
Also, jump clones only show location - not name or implant set, is one or t'other possible?
---
Thanks for the effort chaps.
---
Stilletto
---
cripple fight !!!
---
you didnt tho. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
you just spam warp to warp off your pod atleast. its imposisble for a loki to target a pod before it warps without bubbles. 
---
" My ship didn't warp so I panicked and pressed my afterburner but to no avail as I was deleted.  "
---
either the game bugged or you fucked up. one of the two and i think we both know which is more likely lol.
---
you got it flipped man
---
I think you can still have lots of fun in the game and completely ignore nul-sec politics. But another problem comes into a picture: amount of fun/hour is not that high, often you spend 1-2 hours roaming ... just to get dumped in the end.
---
And, I feel it is indeed CCP who needs to bring improvements here.
---
Any light drones would work, I suppose ECM drones might be best bet even if your chances of breaking their lock isn’t great.
---
Nothing wasted if it prepares you for future encounters.  
---
When I explored I orbited the cans as far out as I could while maintaining hacking range (5km? Don’t recall).  Also, if can has objects around it inside your orbit range you could bounce out of range and waste a hacking attempt.  An unmoving target makes it all the easier for the hunter.
---
It's not strictly a problem. It's just smart strategy. 
---
But it does go toward explaining the shift from 'ships die most often during wars' to 'ships die *least* often during wars'. I'm sure it's only one of several contributing factors to this trend, and that no individual factor is able to fully explain it. 
---
If I had to *guess* at an explanation, I'd guess that the meta prioritises the concentration of ISK into ships that maximise buffer tank (eg. via faction plates and EANMs). Spending a little more money upfront to guarantee survival means you spend less in the long run. 
---
But ships die *least often* during *wars*?! That's completely backwards to how it ought to be.
---
I did, looks like you haven’t tried doing anything but reactively form fleets to chase hunters away, try making a standing fleet in system, or ratting as a group.
---
Might as well call yourselves HoneyBadger 3.0
---
Make sure you take the variant which uses least capacitor if that’s your main issue. ‘Show info’ on a MWD of the size you need, click on the ‘variations’ tab and then the ‘compare’ button on the bottom. This will automatically show you all possible MWD in a comparable list. After doing that, check the boxes of the stats that matter to you, most likely ignoring the purple or green variants which tend to be expensive or requiring of T2 skills. There are I believe 3 meta modules between tech 1 and tech 2 MWD’s which should be available to you.
---
so... are those the words that back up your statements?
---
Fuck the haters, buy that space hammer and revel in its glory
---
That's pretty average for subcap ratting since this group is probably too small to save a cap if it got tacked by a decently sized bomber gang.
---
Curious as to why you’d nerf hel/nyx rather than buff aeon/wyvern?
---
Goons new strat leave titans all over space
---
It's not, but even if say, this group brings a rattlesnake into an anom, that's only going to boost their isk/hour up to 80/hour. If that rattlesnake gets caught by a bomber gang/covert T3 and dies, it has a 12-20 hour repayment time depending on fit.
---
You're not wrong. The entire reason the system sucks is because the ratter would rather be left alone to farm than to fight. This pushes for massive swaths of safely guarded space where nothing fun happens. 
---
You could make space smaller, so factions have to step on each other toes, but that will just merge them until there is enough safe space. Profit should not be earned from safe space, but from dangerous space.
---
The key point is they need to close the loop of PVP vs PVE. Ratting should not be a game of cat and mouse, it should be a game of capture the flag. Resource generation (ISK) in eve should be sourced / enhanced from the effort of PVP combat, not mindless grinding.
---
FW plexes, Abyssals, Incursions, ESS, Entosis, Citadels, and Rorq PANIC all have elements that get close to this goal, and should be iterated and expanded upon. 
---
Stake a flag, challenge all oncomers, to the winner goes the spoils. Greater risk/size of engagement = greater reward. Botting shouldn't even be a consideration, because the contest to generate ISK requires PVP.
---
I do a LOT of ship scanning. I haven't done a serious test, but it does seem to get better results in the first few scans within 5km.
---
&gt; Everyone single person could just reach out to the member that came after them
---
This is assuming everyone is qualified to offer such assistance. Your suggestion typically results in the blind leading the blind.
---
His PVPers are burning out, not the krabs.  If you read you’d know that.  Now stop REEEE’ing, you’re making the rest of us look bad.
---
Wormholer btw
---
Man - I completely forgot about how much I loved Earth and Beyond.
---
I dualboxed and broke that game soo much. Met some really cool people too. It was my first MMO. Nostalgia!
---
No
---
Looking at the Kill board, he isn’t even a big fish, just a plankton that thinks they’re a shark.
---
Since when can you jump a gate without decloaking?
---
Yea i was just giving a simple example. I doubt most of these newbie corps have that many &lt;2 months newbros compared to other members. Each person could reach out to 2 newbros and there would be more than enough to go around.
---
It's definitely doable if corps wanted to focus on it.  But even if they couldn't my point was a smaller corp is probably better for a new person as they won't get lost in the sea (as you are saying happens.)
---
It is very possible to prevent bugs from happening.
---
You need to create a detailed and unambiguous specification.
---
Then you need to mathematically prove that your code meets that specification.
---
Now you have no bugs, but you also have no software as its too much work.
---
How can you tell this is a design flaw?
---
Have you seen a design document that states that cloaked characters should have warp effect sounds?
---
indeed, I had some classes about such a way to program at the university.
---
It only works for simple programs. those that intercat with, eg, network, or client, are muuuuch harder to prove.
---
update guys he's paddling his KB now [https://zkillboard.com/character/2114674237/](https://zkillboard.com/character/2114674237/) can't handle the reddit burn lmao
---
I like it so far, more involved than evanova.
---
If we're going to expect EVE to accommodate distracted parents who regularly have to stop paying attention to the game, then we're all fucked. You're doing the right thing by scaling back until you have more free time.
---
Bah! You're right.. my bad.
---
Maybe you would not divorce if you played less...? Just curious
---
If you ban after some time delay, the botter is done with that account and the isk is already on some RMTer's account.
---
CCP does not want to ban RMTers, they give them some chances to become paying customers.
---
thats not proper logging, that is lazy logging
---
i have a strange idea. instead of buffing all the ships we have now to make them relevant, we could just nerf the few that are the main reason why others dont get used that often.
---
wouldnt that be way easier?
---
If you do not flush data to disk, there is no guarantee that it was ever saved to disk.
---
After eve crashes, how are you going to flush?
---
You didnt have a wormhole permit
---
If pvp pilots are burning out because of combat then they are krabs
---
&gt;  I have a bit of hope for the future.
---
how though?  its the same people making the decisions and executing them.  how do you possibly expect a different result?
---
you know what also applys too well to subcaps? you might be able to guess it.
---
hint, it starts with an ''s'' and ends with ''upers''
---
I concur with this.
---
Cant use it from Android 6.0.1 :(
---
If anyone from 2017 CO2 is still around i'm sure they could give you a solid answer! :D
---
&gt; Stake a flag, challenge all oncomers, to the winner goes the spoils. Greater risk/size of engagement = greater reward. Botting shouldn't even be a consideration, because the contest to generate ISK requires PVP.
---
That action is taking sov itself, while ratting is the mundane task of extracting money from the sov you fought for.
---
The issue is that sov is not king of the hill because nullsec is on fringes rather than the middle. So instead of king of the hill you have 4 kings sitting on their 4 hills all too far away to fight each other without going 50 jumps. If you flip high and null, so that everyone's region can be jumped to in 10-12 jumps, and then make null resource gathering ships big immobile targets like rorquals, you'll have king of the hill for sov space, then king of the hill on in-space resource gathering.

Meta modules are your friend. Sure they will cost a little more, but they have better fitting reqs and do more for you. As well as that, you will want at least an ab on your DD to maintain range and help you move around faster. 
---
   To add to this, basic skills will help you get more out of your ship, so training those along with updating the modules will go a long way. Lastly, using a mwd for pve is a waste as not only does having it equiped cut down on your capacitor, but in the things your fighting the speed boost from a mwd will be more then enough.
---
Recons don't show up on D-Scan.
---
Could also get the WH upgrade and generate even more WHs.  Grind isk in the WHs as a group activity rather than solo.
---
More WH activity CCP!! This is good, this is content! Space should be much closer together
---
is not only bit is stopped... very lot of people not appreciate to ccp himar sell society to chineesse for finish fast the end of life ...
---
i'm director in big corp and I see a big difference before and after blackout -5k/ -10k depend times.
---
ccp stop the blackout i'm praticely sure lof of people coming back=target vut the communuty is salty and i prefer ignore the real problem...
---
The last time I was in a group your size, I lived in Syndicate. That suited us very well. 
---
On the scale of things, you are playing in the “unlimited scale” area. Just like CCP cannot balance every ship hull for 1v1, they cannot balance every part of space for small groups.
---
&gt;  Each person could reach out to 2 newbros and there would be more than enough to go around.
---
Again this tends to lead to the blind leading the blind, not every vet wants to lead newbros around. Leading to attrition back to the point we are at right now. Leading newbros around is a fulltime job, you best be willing to pay for it if you want it done.
---
&gt;But even if they couldn't my point was a smaller corp is probably better for a new person as they won't get lost in the sea
---
Instead they get lost in the timezone shuffle. Because every corp ios "strong in all tz" when that's a blatant lie.
---
Typically you see Hawks for T3+ Dark sites and 2 Retri+Deacon for I think electrical, not sure though. Check out https://www.twitch.tv/videos/476504604 - this is TheCorrupted (one of the top ranked Abyssal PvPers) running sites with this setup. 
---
As for income and loot difference, you get 3x the loot in frigates compared to cruiser sites. To give rough, rough numbers for cruiser sites; T3 - 10m a site, T4 - 25m a site, T5 - 50m a site. Remember - those are really rough numbers, but a good “average” that you can expect. 
---
If you’re ever interested check out the in game channel “Abyssal Lurkers” - here you’ll find a bunch of Abyssal nerds that like to take about Abyssal stuff and hopefully if you have a question someone will know it!

Isn't Theran a small krabbing alliance? They were renting space off frat last time I saw them

Still a better love story than Twilight.
---
Combat recons are good bit harder to move around than force recons in hostile space. You can catch them on gates with a defense fleet, force recons can just get bridged in onto a bomber.

It would be cool to have more functions in the future.

I found dwarf fortress easier lol

Same boat here. Moto G5 Plus, not compatible
---
There's definitely a lot more time to figure out your next move on DF, something that I think makes EvE feel a lot more tense and fun in a different way.
---
Been with my current for 9 years, things are going well, thanks for your concern.

And not a trash catapult. Those can't launch 90kg projectiles over 300 meters.

This is a big thing. I would be so psyched if they released on Stadia!

There are still ways you can implement the kind of thing your asking for. Just clipboard what albion did with hellgates (god knows they were "inspired" by eve for a lot of their game) and it would generate content for both those who want a quick fix of pvp and those roaming in the open world.
---
The game has infinite free trial. What else do you fucking want?
---
20-30k players is "disheartening" to you?
---
There is literally no other game with that number of players on a single server in the entire world.
---
I think this is a very important question being over looked.
---
Forty one fucking systems for a group that effectively can stuff its entirety into a constellation or two.
---

---
NPE is overrated though. Remember how it used to be: rookie ship, here's an asteroid, here's an NPC enemy, good luck. And it was during this period that the game gained the most players.
---
All the people who want MMORPGs with epic storylines and memorable characters... one, are fucking retards, and two, EVE will never ever be a game for them unless it literally shifts genres.
---
Confirmed, scares me shitless everytime.
---
I thought most fights were artificial anyway? Isn't that stated as one of the big things that make people quit eve after being in alliance leadeship or an FC? They see how eve works "behind the curtains" where few fights are "real" but rather FC1 talks to FC2 "hey lets form up and roam and "maybe we will bump into each other"? And when there is a fight over a timer that timer only happened because someone wanted "content", not because they wanted the resources of that system or whatever so arguably that is artificial too?

---
doubtful, you can hear cloaked ships exit warp on your grid if you have the sound on since they added that. So probably happened when they made warp create a localized sound, back in what 2015 or so.
---
This is the only way shit gets addressed. They don't read bug reports, they only answer to public exposure because it runs the risk of mass exploitation. 
---
This is the same with pretty much every online game out there. Once something is brought mainstream that isn't right, it gets addressed.
---
Yikee bro! Good move on leaving.
---
Best I got is roll the wh... I'm loving wh spawn increase as this shit was getting stale as fuck. Bots are slowly figuring it out again so wh's are a key factor in finding anything of value

Game has more people logged in today than when I started in 2006, also I play AUTZ so its even quieter.......

Its a fun game, and I imagine coming into it fresh faced it will still be a great experience as you get to learn the ins and outs. Yes you will die in a fire a few times, but always roll with a punch.

Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!

---
If you push the empires together, they will just fight until one is the winner and dominates all of that space. Then they have all of the resources and are always safe, and the game is won and dies. 
---
You have to remove the situation where the most profit comes from safety. 
---
Sov, structures, etc, are massive investments and can also be great risks of assets, but they generate massive defender advantage, and make space safer. The resources of the game should not be most plentiful under these umbrellas.
---
When resources are on the frontier of the empire, there is less incentive to secure lots of space, only enough to protect your assets, manufacturing, etc, and then send hunting parties out to the wilderness to gather, and risk engagement. 
---
That's where I see the system as being so backwards. You shouldn't be able to make any significant profit from any one constant location. Resources need to deplete, and only respawn in places where the players are not safe. It should take large investment to harvest those resources, and then they dry up and your forced to move again. This will push the players outside of safety where they can be attacked by pirates, and encourage hungry empires to make grabs at resources in less defended parts of other empires. 
---
When money moons were getting rebalanced constantly, the richest regions of space were shifting all around the map, and the big players moved to contest them. These generated some of the greatest wars in EVE. Now, resources in EVE are stagnant, unchanging, and boring. 
---
If Hilmar wants to #chaosERA, they should make only a handfull of r64 moons in the galaxy, and make them respawn in different locations once they mined out, a sequence that would take months, maybe.
---
That's why you are a ghost of querious. Evicted and left behind. I hear SMA lives a wormhole now!
---
If they wanted money they wouldn't limited time release skins. I'd buy several for almost every ship... just missed some of the releases.
---
Remember the old photo of a noob ship with every racial skin.... do that and I'll buy a blood raider skin for every ship I can fly
---
Yes, nothing scarier than a single cap. Spoopy...
---
He means macros.
---
That just results in Locust fleet moving around the cluster helicopter dicking any group unlucky enough to have the R64 spawn in their space.
---
By the way there are ways to make it so that holding even geographically close space is untenable. For example, disallowing inter-region ansiblexes, having two regions be close but not have any gate connections, so the defender will always fight without fatigue while the attacker does, having plentiful NPC space for independent groups to drop on ratters and miners, etc.
---
Where is the low sec part that he own.
---
Well he looks like a brand new player I don't really know what was expected. Is he trying to topple The Imperium with Kony's child army?

Thank you for the link :)  And thank you for the recent wave of new subscribers to the channel, giving the lore as much visibility as possible is very appreciated!

Because the Youtube link above goes to one of my recordings, I'd like to take a moment and talk about the Eve Reader Podcast. CCP has given me permission to make audio recordings of the backstories of Eve (also known as the Chronicles) to help bring the lore of New Eden to life.  I've recorded roughly sixty of these stories, including some non-canon writing contest winners from the Pod and Planet Eve fiction contest.  All of these stories are available as a free MP3 download at [www.evereader.org](http://www.evereader.org) as well as via iTunes and YouTube.  By the way, the YouTube channel with the rest of the Chronicles I've recorded is at [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uty1Lj1jYFU&amp;list=PL17mxkH4sIb2XOferjcTcS27xFwq9B0KZ&amp;index=3) if you'd like to hear more of them.  
---
Would you like to know the story of the first capsuleer and his terrifying fate?  [The Jovian Wet Grave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uty1Lj1jYFU&amp;list=PL17mxkH4sIb2XOferjcTcS27xFwq9B0KZ&amp;index=3) is the story of Hirakii Pirkotan and the first steps we took toward immortality.
---
Did you know our ships have crews?  [All These Lives Are Fit To Ruin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTQd5odluRY&amp;list=PL17mxkH4sIb2XOferjcTcS27xFwq9B0KZ&amp;index=31) is the story of a crewman who wakes up after the destruction of his capsuleer-captained ship... with the capsuleer looking for answers on its destruction.
---
Those, and many more are available.  There are a few episodes on the website that need to be uploaded onto the YouTube channel, plus I have a new episode in edit.  I really need to get that done!
---
I wish CCP was still releasing Chronicles.  Yes, we have a rich history of various player factions interacting and causing some truly epic stories... but the backstory of New Eden is there to be enjoyed by all.  I would like to see it continue to evolve and be told.
---
And if a Triglavian Chronicle were to be released... well, let's just say you would likely count the time until I record it in mere hours!
---
Not to mention he also said career. 😂😂😂😂
---
The general rule of thumb I follow is 10 toons = 1 human.
---
You can easily fit 100 humans into one constellation, especially if they're mining because of how anoms work.
---
They'd be a small alliance if they had half the numbers and a tenth of the systems. As is though, it looks like a classic case of overexpanding and paying the price.
---
PP?
---
How do industrial players move materials and products around highsec? Let's say on the order of 500m in value.
---
You could haul it yourself and get suicided.
---
You could haul smaller quantities at a time and sacrifice time for safety.
---
I see people mention t2 haulers, but I also see gankers say t2 haulers are KOS so that seems like literally putting up a sign saying "pls suicide me".
---
I see mention of courier contracts but I don't understand how that helps. Is there something about the courier package that makes it more gank resistant? Or is it just the collateral you get if the courier is suicided? If so how do you make a profit if you have to pay for courier contracts all the time?

I want to believe this, maybe I was just unlucky when I tried to partner up with a chinese for my company.

They all tried to cheat me, even tried to convince my men to steal from me. Hope I could get to know an honest one soon.
---
I want to say this is proof that I wasn't insane all along but I've always heard warp ins when I'm paranoid.
---
Racist!!!
---
If it's PVE, use afterburner. It doesn't reduce maximum capacitor and doesn't increase signature. Other mid slot ideas are shield booster, missile guidance computer, web, or target painter.
---
Based and redpilled.
---
So nerf hacs, capitals, and stealth bombers? that's more than a few ships. Also t1 cruisers are in a fine place i think so are pirate/navy cruisers and BC are fine too. BS are almost useless and navy BS some of them are actually worse than t1 some navy BS are ok and all t2 bs are pretty aweful for pvp. frigates are also fine imho. but kikis need a nerf
---
Quit making sense
---
Hilmar will ban you for this
---
Sorry.
---
I like how you raged because i wouldn't respond to you, so you decided to go and leave a reply on every other comment i made in the post. lol. That's so pathetic it's almost endearing.
---
what timed releases did you miss?
---
if you're interested in buying full sets of skins i might have some that aren't available in the store any more. you might not like the selection or my prices but...
---
My laptop cn barely run Eve. Trying to play it on my phone would be sentencing it to death.
---
I like the idea that when your structure is destroyed all your stuff remains in a vault at the sun of the system and only the owner of the items can access it.  Like at a structures death the station ejects a special container. Make the container have a 90 day life and then it can be destroyed. A modified asset safety that means you have time , but not forever , and can save you shit.
---
Then surround it in large bubbles and let the people come get their shit the hard way. 
---
Would make for a bit of cops and robbers.
---
i think green is too restrictive.
---
yellow would stop suicide ganking, but not some of the more interesting interactions that can happen.
---
Yes, the basic kiting concept of not getting ganked is covered by the required read material, and the video shows how it's done.
---
&gt; i think green is too restrictive. 
---
That's how you get the money. Once something is comfortable, why pay. Or if pilots want to shoot something go to low or nullsec as an Alpha.
---
You could literally spend a thousand IRL dollars and skill into a bling t3 ship and get the best implants and fly a 10 billion isk fit, and get ganked by a few clever alpha pilots in frigates.
---
if it's too restrictive then you never give them an experience they wish to expand and give you money for.
---
Skip the big ones and find a small Corp. Trust me you'll have more fun and make friends which makes the game worth playing.
---
They can go to a .4 or under and taste test.
---
Just a side note: NPC means "Non Player Character" and refers to every ship controlled by the computer in EVE.  That's why everyone is confused what exactly you're asking.  Sleepers are also NPCs.  I think you mean to hack Pirate sites, aka Guristas, Sansha, etc, but I'm still not totally sure.
---
But why, u butt pain for someone stealing your 4/10 loot?
---
because the character selection creation process is kinda tedious.
---
before you can even dress your space barbie there's a lot of dull reading about schools, races, bloodlines etc - and none of it fucking matters in the slightest.
---
Happy cake day.

No.

Fuck off.

Aren't you rich enough to plex all the accounts ? Don't be a poor, mate.

i'm not quite au fait with low sec mechanics because who the fuck goes to low sec? don't you require your safety to be yellow to do anything offensive in low sec? hence why gate guns shoot you and i get a security status penalty every time we bash a low sec structure?

---
Pandemic Horde is my recommendation.
---
*had*
---
Ganking shouldn't be as prevalent a part of EVE as it is. Zero risk and negligible penalties for death exist nowhere else in the game.  
---
I don't blame gankers, they are playing the game. I blame CCP.
---
Don't have one, even gank in high sec for the lol's from time to time when it's slow.  It's funny that the guys with the $$$ always the last ones that want to pay their way huh.
---
Go to outside world more often.
---
Tbh you may be right, I am in the office so I can't really say but I think in .4 you can shoot with safety green. Im sure someone can confirm though.
---
free to play is just a trial account that doesn't expire, temper your expectations as such.
---
Then recruit someone who's actually an active player rather than from the spawn station undock?
---
Being able to merge twenty 5% crystals into one 100% crystals sounds like a great idea to me.
---
The limiting factor on your range will probably actually be your missile range itself. A Sensor Booster will increase your target locking range, but if your missiles can't reach that far then you'll want to extend them out first. For that, a mid slot Missile Guidance Computer I, and a Missile Range Script for it, will be something you'd want. Possibly even two of them, if the gap between missile range and target range is too large. Also, mobility is generally extremely important, and as such an Afterburner is something you'll want in another mid slot. I'm not sure what to do with the 3rd mid slot, but a second Guidance Computer seems likely.
---
The next issue at hand then is the CPU cost of all of these modules, and to that we turn to Meta modules. Arbalest Compact Light Missile Launchers, and a 1MN Y-S8 Compact Afterburner. Meta Modules are variations of regular modules, each of which has one or more specific improvements over the regular version. Compact modules use less CPU and PWG than regular modules (while also otherwise being direct upgrades to the modules; a compact afterburner gives more speed than a regular one, and Arbalest Compact missile launchers have higher fire rate than tech 1 launchers.)
---
Even with those modules Compact, you still may not have the CPU space needed. For that, we talk Skills. The important skills for this specific problem are CPU Management 5, which gives you more CPU room to play with, and Weapon Upgrades 4, which will both reduce the CPU used by your weapons, and unlock the ability to use Ballistic Control System IIs, which are significantly better than the tech 1 version.
---
If you go for two Guidance Computers, you'll run out of CPU and need to remove something. I'm going to suggest removing the Damage Control, and replacing it with a Nanofiber Internal Structure II. The Nanofiber will improve your speed, acceleration, and turning, allowing you to choose your range better and giving you an opportunity to try to escape if things start to go badly. However, without the resistance of the damage control, when your shields start to run low you need to be ready to decide if you can safely stay or need to leave.
---
The world was a different place back then. Smart phones weren't a thing. F2P gaming didn't exist. There was basically nothing in terms of competition within the genre. 
---
People will suffer through a shitty NPE when there's literally no other games for them to play instead.

That's way too high. Goonswarm sits at around 5/real person, and we are pretty alt heavy with multiboxed rorqs and shit.
---
This.

New characters should be a faceless silhouette. Just a single screen with a textbox for a name, and drop-downs for Empire, Sex, and Race/Bloodline. Then give a free, non-transferable character re-sculpt to use later on.

No boring people with irrelevant crap.

EVE was always a niche game. The kind of people who would 10 years later play cash shop shit on their smartphones were never a target audience.

That has a 1m clone cost, if you're looking to frequently use one just use a shady one with cheap/free clones. Risk is limited since you're going to be logging out in the pod most the time anyway.
---
As somebody that has had a single cap dropped on my small group who promptly scattered, you should definitely do this.
---
So because they're bad at PVP, the game should nerf to the level anyone can hold space regardless of if they can defend it? Those aren't big feeds, it's bad fleets.
---
You really want cyber 5 anyway so that you can use pirate implants. If you're going to PVP and have passed the stage of being complete trash not using snakes, crystals or askleps is just silly.
---
For PVP sure, but OP does exploration so that argument is moot.
---
You're quite special aren't you? it's quite eay to kill a bomber fleet lol, a harpy fleet will annihilate a stuka fleet even in smaller numbers, as they're unaffected by bombers and track perfectly against bombers, kikis and command dessies, jackdaws will also easily beat a stuka fleet, stay out of kiki range at 50-60 km and just snipe command dessies and kikis and logi, bombers are no threat at all to both of these doctrines and they eat stukas for breakfast, the problem is that people like you just want to drop your fancy caps and expect to win because "my ship is expensive it should win"

All players of my corp have to inform me a month in advance before logging in, so I know how many people will be online at any point.

My hauler/market alt is 77% dangerous. My main who is a pirate is 76% dangerous...

I don't know how this number is calculated but this sure doesn't make sense.
---
Good advice, thanks
---
What I'm personally more interested in is this part of the post
---
&gt; I logged into sisi, opened up all kinds of debugging tools and got ready to start playing around.
---
I wonder what "other" debugging tools would show if you have this much info provided by an ingame logging tool...
---
I don’t mind defending the space. What makes me sad is hearing line members start to ask “maybe it would be better to just go join one of the big blocks”. We had fun winning the sov war and evicting enemy alliances when we took the space. But these hit and run WH guerrilla tactics wear on you. It’s like slow drip water torture.
---
I cant. Its dark
---
The EVE experience has always been pretty niche and it is hard to feel involved when new to the game.
---
Let's face it, space is big and in EVEs case, also really empty. They have done a better job with the new iteration, were you have at least some NPCs fighting the drifters with you, but as far as tutorials go, you will probably not have any clue what is happening in the first place and you still spend some time warping around the system with nothing really happening.
---
Yeah that’s not a half bad idea. Miners might have to start getting used to the idea of paying for a defense fleet
---
Right dude. Literally Russian roulette. You just can't avoid losing ships now so the only activities worth it are ones that make enough money to cover the loss of your ship. But these activities just don't exist either because the revenue is too low or because the cost of a ship to do them effectively outweighs the reward still. I used to do all sorts of exploration and pve sites in null. I came back last week and lost two expensive ships that completely killed any income. All that I can think would be worth it would be going back to just relic sights in an Inty or something which is really boring.
---
Good advice thank you
---
This ^
---
Who said we are spread out over that space? We are not trying to defend everything on a nightly basis. I’m talking about our pocket where everyone lives.
---
Just because we hold the TCU does not mean we actually live in those systems
---
Not again...
---
Experience may vary, but from my time in nullsec I definitely didn't get the impression that FCs arranged a lot of fights between them. Certainly a lot of them were just for content, especially during periods of peace, but the idea here is still that you force your opponent into giving you said content by, say, tackling one of their rorqs or supers.

---
Really good answer, though please stop telling everyone that playing alone is absolutely unbearable. Some people like it to play on their own, without belonging to any group (with friends somewhere out there ofc, but without everyday interaction). Me, for example.
---
I can see that, even though I think its a good thing. There's also WH space, and non-sov null, let alone high/low after all. But like I also said, I think its too easy for huge alliances to hold sov. The more territory, the harder it needs to be to hold, and the further from some kind of "capitol", the more difficult to protect. Decreased timers, higher costs, less benefits, etc.
---
Every empire ever, and even large countries, have trouble controlling territory far from their center of influence. Why should Eve be any different?
---
The Blue Donut is the inevitable end in a balance of power system like Eve otherwise. You balance against, and smaller groups merge or ally with larger ones for protection. I'm just going back and looking at my notes from college years ago on this, and its cool how much of political relations applies to Eve. We're in kind of a classical European 19th Century Balance of power situation, with several major players who (more or less) play by the rules. Unless the rules shift, the situation will stay the same.
---
Majority haven’t recently experienced the struggles of taking sov developing it and having to move and setup again. As we all know the game has been getting more and more stale and sectioned off. Eve map since 2 years ago looks at lot less populated by smaller groups. Ideally people cycle through the different types of space and move to low sec or high sec to start their journey again. Space getting depleted where sites stop spawning/ore belts don’t replenish would help with this. But this would make Eve online almost a different game and at this stage it could be too late for anything of that sort.

---
Seems so convenient that the scale is exactly 1.
---
T2 Haulers aren't KoS; suicide gankers will still want to get their money's worth out of killing your ship. A common rule of thumb for hauling is "[maximum of 3M ISK per 1k of EHP"](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Hauling#Expensive_Cargo). Use that rule and upsize your ship accordingly to find a good time spent for #m3 hauled balance that works for you.
---
The thing about courier contracts is that the collateral protects you from suffering the financial loss of the material. If you contract it through people that make a eve-living out of hauling, you're paying a modest fee for their expertise to get your cargo safely to it's destination. And if they don't, you just earned 10-15% of your cargo's worth through the collateral. (Assuming you follow "Haulers channel" guidelines.)
---
I'd advise you to pop into the ingame channel "haulers channel" and ask for their advice. Friendly people there who'll be happy to help.
---
Nice guide. I am a carebear and have been ganked a couple times in my career, most of the time while being the lazy guy you describe in your guide :)
---
It's nice to take a look into the other side. Nothing really surprising in terms of game mechanics, but some insights on topics you usually do not think about when you are just looking at gankers as an annoyance that sits on gates/stations or meets you in belt with catalysts.
---
Biggest gripe is the kill right mechanic and that you can just clear them with alts if they are public, maybe it would be nice if you could sell them to players/corps/alliances directly
---
YES PLEASE!
---
every game is like this.
---
The new one is pretty nice actually.
---
It gives really big pictures and quick easy descriptions.
---
What it doesn't do is make it clear that you can use all of them.
---
As someone whose part of a small null sec alliance with a medium-high level of independence from the blocks. I’ll tell you that it’s important know when roaming fleets pass by. Having everyone always be on coms is a must have if you want to successfully run a small alliance as it makes everyone safer, helps coordinate defense. Even kitchen sinks need to pick and choose the right targets and have Skirmish FC’s help with that.          Something I currently do every day is scanning every single signature 6-10 jumps out from our space while people are ratting/mining and it’s likely saved us billions in ships/time lost. I’ve also encouraged everyone do something similar and play a part, and in just 2 weeks of doing it myself I now rarely see an unscanned/unaccounted for sig nearby. And yes, I explore for my income and this does bite me in the butt but I still call it a success.
---
Just give a warning if the costs are above 0 isk.
---
I had over a dozen jackpots on those machines and it was all house money that I funded the accounts with.
---
I made 3 characters per account and claimed promo's. Whenever a character got over perhaps 1 Billion isk I would subscribe the account and withdraw (monthly sub cost a bit less  isk back than)
---
Dozens of characters and the site made you play isk before withdrawing of course. Every set of promos I would chain apply to the characters in quick succession (sometimes grabbing up many of limited promos that perhaps only had 50 total claims)
---
I don't know how much I profited in the end, dozens of billions; grabbed plenty of pilots with SP etc. Plus it was dopamine when those jackpots hit. I profited IWI in a way I wish I profited the blink sommer mahm site (maybe pulled 3 billion in assets or isk total)
---
Does an assault frigate fleet really need a specialist ship for that?
---
I figure that if E-Uni (not generally renowned as an elite PVP corp) can get consistently good results on big ships in J-Space with a mix of Retributions/Slicers, Enyos/Comets, and Jaguars/Firetails, you're going to need it either no more expensive at all or insanely better in order to be worthwhile.
---
This one's more of a gank than an actual fight, but it's illustrative.  [https://zkillboard.com/kill/78574211/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78574211/)
---
I hit the jackpot twice, 10b, and 79b. It was like crack doing those high cost slots. I've never gambled in my life other than IWI. Lots of fun. Would never do it with real money.
---
hey it was a good fight for sure guys. To bad we didnt trade a little better isk wise but great content all around. o7
---
I use a blockade runner or freighter for that.
---
If it's small stuff, blockade runner, if it's large stuff, freighter.
---
500m isn't even a lot.
---
Glass him Falcon! Right in the face.
---
Hate it when users spout crap like that - Sure we'll have a fix rolled out in 5 mins without QC, testing, regression testing or documentation - we're magicians you see!"
---
Sorry, I'm bitter :D
---
Collateral should always cover the value of the items, not be only 10-15%
---
Not that I've noticed. Could be though.
---
Adapt or die.
---
It used to be more clear before citadel's, but supers can't dock at npc stations.
---
Good luck trying to find out who is looking at logs and justifying banning them - there's no real way to prove that someone has used this exploit - it is game breaking, but now that CCP are aware of it, I'm sure it'll be sorted soon.
---
"Raise hand" ... wait, oh nvm
---
T2 give don't require Omega
---
You mean guns? Small and mediums yes, large no.
---
another one
---
Didnt know that Ronnie Pickering played EVE :D
---
i dont know how much standing gain for soe (enough for level 3 i guess) but you can get a significant boost for one of the 4 main factions of your choosing
---
Okay? And that means what? You haven’t said anything in this thread besides the fact that you’ve been playing for 13 years.
---
The problem with CO2 is that as soon as it takes its first breath, it dies again. Give it up guys!
---
you idiots just keep bringing up the same dumb fuck arguments every time. yes i am aware fessors harpies jackdaws zealot munins eagles and whatever else dumb fuck thing you want to say will kill bombers. it does not matter because you will still die in 100 of whatever to 500 bombers/kikis because bomber torps apply better than heavy missiles you arent going to form large enough numbers of subcap to deal with a giant stuka fleet in 5 mins before the rorq(s) die. AND GUESS WHAT if you somehow manage to rage ping 200 guys in 5 mins then you still lose because the stuka fleet will fuck off because they are fucking frigates. so tell me again how this is fun and engaging gameplay. fucking dumb fucks atleast be fucking original in your dumbfuckery
---
Not really. At least not as a real gameplay loop.
---
You could go out in a small ship and rat alongside a carrier but the carrier wouldn't need you unless a hunter shows up
---
Confessor pilot here. We took a handfull of structure bombs but that was it. We thought some of the small ships surrounding the Athanor would be targeting us but we paused the repair timer primarily uncontested. Super fun fight and a nice change of pace for us.
---
Everyone here is talking as if this was something that was widely exploited by some people yet there is no proof that anyone else even knew about it.
---
For all we know this bug might have been introduced to the game only just recently whenthey fixed cloaky ships staying on your overview after warping away.
---
Is there more pressure to fix this now? Yes, definitely. But sometimes its not an easy fix and needs some major code changes. Ghost training was talked about on reddit for a long long time until it was fixed and I assume thats not because there was "no pressure" but rather that the fix might have required a major code change which takes a while to do.
---
Well obviously it's not enough but it's more than enough to get suicided for.
---
Depending on the size of the group, it could be more viable to just squat.
---
Toss a citadel down and live there without their name on the screen.
---
&gt; They are playing in a serious way and you all want to play for fun? Then join goons
---
True
---
caps don't get dropped to save things because its fun, they get dropped because they are the best way to fight outnumbered against anything. and allot of the time they do bring in subcap support and allot of times all the subcap support dies because SB do more dps at longer ranges than a cruiser with similar application while costing a fraction as much.
---
Not to be an ass or anything but can't you literally do level3 missions to make way more money per time than hauling shit around highsec? Are there actually people who are just really that into the space trucker fantasy?
---
Smarter to attack blockade runners that do a normal warp.
---
Some may land outside docking ring and that's when you get them.
---
Yes. Thanks for clarifying. Collateral should be "cargo value + 10-15% of cargo value."
---
What space are you in? In minmattar fw you can't go to caldari space.
---
This sounds like bullshit. Do you have any proof for what you claim?
---
Why would people.fight over a non-unlimited anomoly.supply when they have a nice unlimited supply in their own controlled systems?
---
well its enjoyable and all but the market has nothing in it and i think a destroyer should have more then 2 weapons ...
---
Yeah, the main faction boost is more of an added bonus (I don't need it). I'm just interested in seeing what's the better option to get to lvl 4 SoE missions the fastest.
---
"millions that play.." dafuuk privat server :o gimme link please for eve with millions of players.. XD
---
Npc nullsec isn't held by an empire faction though.
---
So lorewise there isn't reason why it would be treated differently.
---
you need [skills](https://evemarketer.com/types/25544) for that y'know what i'm saying  
---
skills that those elite pvp haters who hate on mining all day don't have ^like ^in ^the ^other ^replies ^amirite ^man  
---
anyway they will pay you [mad isk](https://evemarketer.com/types/30377) because they can't huff their gas for free but *you* can  
---
anyway i was going to guide you further into this but i'll just tell you to google "eve gas huff how" instead [because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeYsTmIzjkw) yeah
---
Things you can do for pve with the lot of wh you have would be solo C3 site with a praxis (quite cheap) except data/relic or doing C5 fleet.
---
You can also do explo in the relic site in c1/2/3 to get quick and quite high value loot.
---
Abyssal runs can work and can be also a bait.
---
But if the fluid routers are so hard pressed for fuel, Concord could save even more ISK by not having to refuel them as often.
---
So then it sounds that it's working well.
---
It's university, not a career
---
Send it to me and ill make slut sounds....
---
But you just said there are shyer people.
---
They would break the chain.
---
I would agree with this statement. As a member, I really don't get the people who just want to stick around forever multiboxing Orcas.
---
&gt; Came here looking for opinions on ways to make the small alliance Null life work and the answers are
---
&gt;1) Join the giant blue donut in the sky
---
&gt;2) quit the game
---
Do what everyone else does in high challenge situations.
---
organize, fleet up, fit for the situation.
---
If the situation "you can mine in peace"  no longer holds, but instead is "I'm doing pve or mining that can turn into pvp with almost no warning and does so pretty consistently on average.".
---
Then you simply need to prioritise consistent success over big ticks. I.e. Do pve and mining cooperatively with pvp protection on grid.
---
If you're not willing or able to do that and go "but muh ticks", then yeah, quitting that nullsec life is with no alternative. You can still go to plenty of other regions that aren't fought over. 
---
Space is big and the space in eve is particularly empty. If you don't like the noise where you are, go somewhere quite.
---
Honestly, no offense, but it's pretty fascinating that people basically say: "Look at that, my safe space is gone, I have tried nothing, I have not adapted to the situation. I want my safe *and* convenient *and* profitable *and* remote *and* quiet nullsec system back. With system tier upgrades." Like, seriously?
---
Well, considering the empires pay for Concord, it seems dropping local from empire space would be dumb.
---
whatever you end up choosing make sure you are high on [that stuff](https://evemarketer.com/types/49701) and [this stuff](https://evemarketer.com/types/49749) in the meanwhile
---
even the regular level 3 blitzing should get you to +5 in enough time then
---
Yeah, he came to a meetup or something.
---
The lore can have flexibility to suit it for NPC sov to have local like npc pirate factions beginning to fuel their own fluid routers as it is affecting their operations etc. not that hard
---

After opening the app:

OK
---
Then the app crashes
---
Fluid routers are paid for out of the same budget item as gate guns.
---
i'm doing fine tbh  
---
yes it's not 2019 quality but i actually see the stars and shit
---
Wondering if a 1440p, 120 hertz monitor will be good enough for Eve? Running two clients and a 5700xt gpu.
---
Thx guys! this is as good time as any to read up a bit to give the storm time to pass
---
OP says very large holes, there wandering holes rather than statics ( spoiler there, not rage rolled ), unless they come from high class shattered hole. 
---
Reducing rage rolling if anything will reduce their ability to close them this isn't a c2 &gt; NS group just rage rolling for OP's home and CCP is unlikely to fully break rage rolling ( because it would make ratting way to easy ).
---
Ah, cool. Didn't even know those existed. Thanks!
---
I don't know their agreement ,i just know my friend's structure under siege and he need some help

Have you not risen? In Horde
---
Who? When did they live to die?
---
clearly the comment has hurt his pride
---
Knowing when to give up is at least as valuable as grit ;)
---
Well, NPC stations in NPC null got station guns.
---
Not that it really makes a difference having local vs no local in NPC null anyway...
---
Don't tell them about goons and rorqs...
---
Ascendance is recruiting
---
Yeah. That's weird too. But at least you can make more ISK that way.
---
If this is the posting quality of Co2 than what the Judge did to you was a favor.
---
Just no.
---
how long were you all krabbing for? surely your not all skint?
---
chill, have some fun, bait instead of krab, roam and DONT krab so your not tired. or all rat together rather than spread out and keep an eye out. roll one system alone for example
---
kitchen sinks are fun, and can work just fine. just make it a 'armour' kitchen sink, or 'kitey' kitchen sink
---
A hack hac?
---
a good few did.
---
After you gank a hauling ship, you’ll need to collect the loot. It’s safer to do this with a skilled hauling alt. T2 hauling ships are not easy for opportunistic anti-gankers to pin down in high-sec.
---
Did you read that, after your trainwreck of an interview with TIS you should think about this comment.
---
Step 1: get a Catalyst. Get all up in that Catalyst. I mean *get up IN there*
---
Step 2: buy cheapest best neutron blasters. Those things... mmm... so fine.
---
Step 3: 10 rounds Caldari Navy antimatter for each gun should do it. Don't wanna be totally irresponsible. Gotta manage costs damn it!
---
Step 4: all these mag stabilizers. Can't hold all these mag stabilizers
---
Step 5: dancing girls: ✔ tobacco: ✔ booze: ✔ reckless abandon: ✔
---
Step 6: ??? (your security status has been lowered somehow)
---
Step 7: profit
---
There. Go have fun shooting haulers parked doing PI. Its not a clean life, but it's a living.
---
Can a republic fleet firetail or vigil do L3 FW missions in minmatar space? How about a Dramiel? I am currently alpha and would prefer not to train into a second races ships but I would if I had to (lite rp with this toon) but SBer or t3d is out of the question for now
---
"Loyalty is not a necessary quality for a friend"
---
Here's where you're wrong, pal
---
Quite well written, nice work.
---
Id personally say we are doing considerably better than Co2 these days.
---
- Citadels may be hacked.  
---
rip small corp
---
I think you are still in middle school.
---
Works smooth on Note 9. 
---
No wallet? 
---
There is a small delay when opening mails.
---
Also, how fast are mails being updated? Could we use this as possible ping service in corp fleets?
---
Copy and paste from eve mail? Alliances like to send eve mails with links to forum posts with alliance info and fits etc. Would be helpful if we could copy from the app and paste externally.
---
you can´t rise ... if you are stucked "somewhere" where it is really dark!
---
Upvoted!
---
ok. Thank you for your input
---
One of the most fun things i remember from way back in the day is sneaking in late at night with my corpmates and 2 other corps to ninja-recapture a station, so we could get our stuff back when half our alliance betrayed us (they caused a war so they would have a reason to break off and form a new alliance, and that's how ascendant frontier was born) and the other half had pretty much dissolved and given up.
---
Scouts on the way, battleships moving in, recapturing the station, forming a perimeter, maintaining system control long enough and escorting everyone while they moved their stuff out, one ship and one cargo hold at a time.
---
Sadly, the average nullsec mentality today is too soft for things like that, which leads to the perpetuation of "spoonfeeding" mechanics, which in turn leads to less emergent gameplay and less memorable stories. And then people wonder why "i'm bored with the game, nothing's happening". Of course nothing interesting happens when the game plays itself for you and the risk is minimized, lol. What did you expect?
---
Asset safety was a big mistake and needs to go.
---
I dont care if it s one or 6k player when it s online and in space ;=)
---
Dunno, I'm not a hauler. This is just knowledge I picked up when I looked into having my shit moved through courier contracts.
---
I figure it's a way for some to hang back and watch tv while they earn a little no-effort isk?
---
A common fit ive seen on Solo pvp Curses is, 2rapid lights(faction for fitting) Gist Xtype XLARGE reps, cap battery, HG crystal pod, its completly cap stable and PDS in the lows until your cap stable maybe a DDA if you can? its like a 3bill fit. 
---
and tbh your sac is paper tank, somthing as lightly tanked as that i personal would want a MWD to get ontop of them and apply the hams and webs. but then again, id be flying the dual rep cap stable sac myself. (i dont do abyssal though)
---
My point being if the ingame logs already show this much (I actually can't believe I'm saying this!) what will those other tools show...
---
Send it to me and I'll just make sounds.
---
The logs! 
---
The show something! 
---
Holy shit!
---
scary AF
---
You can send your isk to me and I will make sloth sounds in return
---
PROMO BLINKS UP!!

#noHands
---
I don't understand. He never made threats and said he never logged in for a month. This dude never plays the game and people are jumping in on his stats? Why?
---
Hilmar is that you ?
---
hope that late boosh helped!
---
I imagine there would be lots of false positives, people might just get lucky. If it happened regularly though, yeah, banhammer time
---
Did everything perfectly LUL
---
Still regret not taking a Guardian Vexor when I won double on one of the raffles, should have taken the GV and then cash for the double prize rather than both prizes as cash.
---
Galaxy a8    android 9   it doesnt work on it

---
Do faction warfare missions give storyline missions every 16 completed? or how are faction standings gained?
---
its called sustainable farming honey, dont b salty
---
Yes, fuck you and your heretic pizza.
---
Fuck you, pinapple pizza is my favorite and you can't take it from me!
---
Not to be that guy mate but this would have happened sooner or later. It takes time for the blocs to get new routines and after that the hunters would be farming the small guy again. Thats why the blocs became blocs after all. Its always the smaller groups that get hit the hardest from changes like this which is a real bitch since imo those are the only thing that long term can break stagnation.
---
Only advice is if this continues just put alts in HS for moneymaking, switch over to exploration, run DED sites if you can find them. Because long term you wont be able to keep up, it will just burn you out so dont even try (ive been in smaller groups under fire, after a while people just stop logging in).  Make safer money and just fight in NS instead for fun.
---
Also, while you're at it give an option to repackage multiple ships at the same time. Repackaging ships one at a time is pia when moving.
---
KB stats are important /s     
---
Anyway, I understand shitting on the other guy's stats, since he acts like a real tough guy.
---
Hurricane Fleet here. GJ! was a hard grid, everyone seems to stay well away from you XD you did well from watching the video.
---
sorry about slyce dropping dreads, i moaned at them after xD
---
Does a sloth even make a sound?
---
a bling implanted leshak in horde in nullsec? hmmm
---
By all means yes, it’s worth getting into. Eve is primarily what you make it out to be.
---
There’s certainly been some fundamental changes lately as there’s no local, and a soon(tm) upcoming change to cynos, and this where things gets a bit complicated when it comes to the moaning you see here. The voices you hear is often as i understand it is often the most passionate eve players around, while the more silent types like myself is busy doing our own thing. 
---
The other side of the observed toxic behavior seen is that most people around will turn on a dime and be your best friend for a while as seen with the B4R (broadcast for reps) movement so to speak. And most will be more than happy to give a helpfull advice after whooping your ass in combat (given that you ask for advice). We all want the best fight possible in the end.
---
Eve is vast, so finding a corp that suits what you want to do is prime. 
---
The larger corps often has niche groups with people doing their bit in eve internally, and so it’s not uncommon to be able to move between these groups until you find your thing. Welcome to the political side of eve btw, this is an outward power projection kind of situation where the public nummerical listed amount of players in an alliance is a potential deterrent.  
---
I digress however, yes, eve is an elderly lady staggering down the road, but she still has much to offer still.
---
Don’t be afraid of trying out different things until you find your particular thing to do.
---
Just read what it is. This is awesome actually in regards to another thing I was thinking about. That we would need a special resource to build caps. I was thinking in terms of an NPC region but this would work as well. Basically remove all caps and force people to grind a specific mat which would lead to all types of new content.
---
Eve has been dying since 2003, doom and gloom posts are a favorite past time. The game is currently in flux and changing, hopefully toward something better. We'll see. It's an exciting time for Eve, but change is always scary.
---
You're projecting your RL obsessions onto other people, like that lowsec gate Stain is never going to get.
---
Local...you show off
---
Thank you for your answer:) 
---
The difference between T4 and T5 is just that there are bigger and full life vessels and that the malus is random (50% to 70%)? 
---
So the T4 is more complicated, right?  with malus  at all times 70%
---
15-year veteran here.
---
Almost every MMOG community is negative on the outside in the forums or Reddit. Eve is no different. There will always be posts on negative topics like loss of players to broken systems. 
---
Eve has certainly shrunk. It's a very old and mature game that is facing similar challenges that other games in the MMOG genre are facing. MMOG's are just not as popular as they once were.
---
I would say the game is still very healthy and alive in most spaces. It certainly could improve in some areas like for example, low security space or more active US players. But, overall, still plenty of players and content to get into from PvP to PvE.
---
Eve is niche, but it's appeal and cultivation to that niche is still freaking amazing. Eve still surpasses top IP's due to how well they please us. For example, Star Wars had mass appeal, but has less players and less successful than Eve today. A niche game beat out some of the worlds largest brands, publishers and developers with a niche unknown IP.
---
You really cannot compare and the game will be around for awhile. However, the one fear I will note is what happens after the earn out from the publisher who bought CCP. We still do not know what that looks like and how they will appeal to said niche.
---
Yeah being Test pets is an exclusive honor these days apparently
---
do away with asset safety all together, solves ALOT
---
I suppose this would also require hardware that unambiguously executes instructions.
---
Dude. those are awesome. Now I know what to listen to at work.  
---
Just listened to ep 1.  Man... capsuleers really are assholes.
---
just fly cloaky ships so the skins dot bother you
---
I'm surprised this isn't downvoted for going against the "small groups are loving every single one of CCP's changes" narrative.
---
Oh for sure, command desie to the recuse!
---
I could continue arguing about this (cause some of the shit youve written is, well..) or I can just ask you this. Why even go through all of this? Whats the motivator? You have written almost a full page on things that are wrong with these changes (even though you dont realise it youre just proving my point) and somehow you are missing one key factor, the why.
---
Why not just move to HS where you dont have to do these things for one? And get better isk on top of it. Whats the pull of NS? Fozziesov? Citadel spam? Cynojammers? Having to light cynos with recons?
---
And most importantly, why even bother with the game if its gonna be this tedious? When theres tons of games out there with much less boredom?
---
You guys keep focusing on the tree but missing the entire fucking forest burning behind it.
---
Aw cute the fishhead knows english
---
You sound like a broken record. Null krabing has been gathering resources way above any actual and potential war effort. You need people to mine and build but you really don’t need a lot of them. Ccp just fucked up with game balance and it created a vicious cycle of people ratting and mining to inject more capital ratters and miners and build more capital ratting and mining ships that would never die. The whole null sec anomaly ratting for example is a pure nonsense and doesn’t add anything useful to the game and one can only be happy that this major isk faucet is dealt with.
---
You kinda do need a defense fleet to stop people camping your mission pipe if you don't want to be logging out rather often
---
Most likely will as soon as I can convince my CEO not to gank me when he sees mine :P
---
You don't want to mine all day? Wtf?
---
Seems legit
---
I don't see gate to Stain as item from RL ... or Stain. Yet you do ....
---
It will genuinely make more people leave though.
---
Make it a huge isk sink, with a portion of that distributed to attackers sure, but people will stop keeping all their stuff in null or just quit permanently when they come back and it's gone.
---
Playerbase down 40% in a few months?   
---
What are you smoking bro, pass that shit.
---
LITERALY ALL OF EVE
---
:)
---
Why do you need FCS AND PVPERS to roam for fun? Why do you need pointless paperwork to have fun, as opposed to just going out and doing stuff when you want to? Maybe the reason you're getting burned out is that you're relying on the same few people to babysit you in even the smallest of engagements, sounds like your alliance as a whole isn't that fond of PVP.
---
 ~~a bait post~~ ~~an ideas post~~  a bad post
---
&gt;All shooting PVE becomes more mission-like: quests and escalations. Single-system farming is non-viable. 
---
To be fair, this actually is a good idea, forcing players to move around the constellation more medium rewards and around the region (or even multiple) for big rewards will lead to more ships on gates.
---
There will of course be the groups/players that just send a ceptor to the system and sell the bookmark for the next escalation and buy the escalations in their system, but for small player groups, you can spend an evening chasing the bigger reward, provided you can find the entry point for the journey.
---
&gt; Asset safety has a hard value limit. 
---
No matter how much that value actually is, people will argue it's either to high or too low, while at the same time finding multiple ways to circumvent it (plastic wraps, items in containers in ships, just deploying a new citadel once you reach asset safety limit)
---
&gt; Capitals may be repackaged and stored to asset safety on demand. 
---
You can already send stuff to asset safety manually. To make it less punishing for players who take extended breaks, a good idea might be a linear decrease in asset safety payment, so that you can pay for your assets once you come back to the game, but can't abuse it to move stuff out quickly.
---
&gt; Citadels may be hacked. 
---
Yes, I would like to hack into the TTT and get myself some PLEX, but in general this is a terrible idea, considering there are groups that do not cover multiple  timezones all the time.
---
&gt; Ratting income, if single-system farming continues, may be taxed with an easy-to-deploy, easy-to-destroy, one per constellation module: a tax siphon. 
---
Apart from all the other reasons why removing ISK from the wallet of other players is a bad idea, this can be easily rendered useless by sending your ISK to another character after ratting (unless you want to neg-wallet people).
---
we need walking in station back, with the option to run a casino in our corp office.
---
I do miss Somer Blink, I remember teaching a bunch of newbros while going through some wormholes.
---
I was in comms and said NEVER talk in local. 10 seconds later I type PROMO in local.
---
Is it still worth it to become a new player in EVE Online? Given that I would be some 16 years behind?
---
Thanks everyone! Eve is definitely a game more in my niche. I've always enjoyed games where pvp is a culmination of production chains ran by players, which on the largest scales is for control of territory. I've played only very few games like this and so many of them are old and distressed. I'll look into joining eve university and get a handle on the game. Thanks so much for your input! I've been a bitter vet myself and just wanted help parsing how much was legitimate panic or misplaced love
---
Yeah,  slooooowly
---
Null security space is for warriors.
---
If life in null security space is too difficult.
---
Live in high security space.
---
Then again yankees are not actively breaking basic human rights every day and doing other shady shit...
---
If CCP needs a real ISK sink, then they could always bring back gambling and put it in game...
---
Just don't let the players run the house...
---
Works just fine, pixel XL with Android 10 here
---
Doesnt work that way as you would have to raise then the the age rating and get a license in many countrys to run the game yada yada yada its simply Not worth the effort
---
raise stump?

He's got 10-15 of the supers and carriers himself don't you know?
---
Are you sure?
---
I'm not so sure that's the case, as it's not real money. Hell, don't some Final Fantasy games have gambling?
---
And what makes you think he'll exclusively do exploration?
---
my man
---
The whole cap buff was a major mistake fest.
---
If it wasn’t for Legacy though XD
---
I like how you went to highsec though. Cant drop caps there 25 IQ move.
---
Razor died with a little bit of dignity and will actually be missed. More than can be said for others.
---
Lots of the NullSec home defence ships are bling as fuck because there’s little chance you will get caps dropped on your head when defending your space. Most of my home defence ships and pods will net you a 3-5b killmail if you manage to kill both, I’m sure horde has rich bittervets too
---
i chuckled now  take my fucking upvote TAPI bro.
---
It's still great.

Remember: subreddits of full of people with complaints. People enjoying their time in the game don't feel any need to come tell everyone they are enjoying the game. And if they did, they would probably get reported for a low effort post.

better than winterco's pets or CVA pet tbh.

the guys that fight in that standing defence fleet die all the time, huge fleets daily come through and pwn shit. its also unnecessary.
---
Maybe some of the older FF games before laws changed
---
But as we talk about isk gambling we all know with a pre heated cc you can gain isk Real easy so im p Sure any twisted lawyer could turn this into a Case of Real money gambling and make them obey the law

C3 sleeper relic / data can be pretty chalenging. It's close to C4 regulars anomaly.

so, be ready to eat + 1k dps (1400 dps max) while beeing neuted and pointed.

I'm not sure a vaga can handle it

I used to do it with a moderate rattlesnake pimp (~ 1b) in 15-25min. 200-300M / h with only one ship is nice.

last thing, take care about your cargo hold. If you hack the cans, the loot is big. 1 site can fill an Astero

Pretty sure if he was flying a Leshak it wasn’t meant to be disposable.
---
In what way?
---
Yeah i miss iwi and somer blink made and lost billions of isk but it was fun winning ships and isk
---
I always go out stabbing folk if I fail at pvp. Really cheers you up.
---
a cheap fit leshak can be fucking awesome fun, and destroy shit, but not a heart breaking loss if you loose it and a pod.

---
It s worth it. Never die in 3 years in the carrier. At the begining i was using jc in cita before ratting but  some month after i let the clone with his +5 implant everytime.
---
Well now with the bo i dont play the carrier anymore but the character is still skilling with +5
---
Nice to see more lowsec fights! Hope both sides had fun

Tell me more of this low sec industrial empire... for reasons of... err... maybe wanting to join it, yeah yeah, wanting to join it. Tell me

I won an Obelisk on this site a few years ago when I was still somewhat figuring out what I want to do in EVE. I figured I'd use it instead of selling it and it got me into space trucking. I still use that same Obelisk to this day.
---
Got greedy and died loosing it all.  No surprise.  That may seen harsh but this is Eve, it will chew you up and spit you out.  Got to be more risk averse if you want nice shiny stuff (don't do that though, spaceship explosions and good).  
---
I did almost the same thing and lost 700 million isk+ in a confessor/pod testing it out the VERY FIRST time in my static.

Lesson learned

While I'm all for removing gambling overall (it's purely harmful to society with no benefit to anyone but a few individuals profiting from the suffering of many) I have to admit, I do sometimes miss betting on the Alliance Tournament on whatever the fuck Niraia's gambling portal was called. New Eden Poker or something. 
---
Best vigs, fun times. 
---
Ah well, it's not like we even have AT anymore, so fuck it.
---
MFW my former main that I haven't played on since I came to CCP seven years ago has better killboard stats...
---
&gt; however once I came to the subreddit I've been met with a torrent of people claiming that the game is coming to its doom, everyone has abandoned nullsec and that nobody is actually playing anymore 
---
There has never been easier to try eve than now. Ships are cheap, alpha clones are a thing, everyone wants more bodies in ships, ship replacement programs (SRP) ensures you can fly in strategic fleets for free and don't have to grind isk at all. 
---
Up until the "chaos" stuff more things died per month than entire years prior. So there's plenty of stuff going on, its just that the bittervets have gotten desensitized a bit in regards to content. 15+ years of groups routinely removing FCs who lose one fight too many, have resulted in the remaining fleet commanders (FCs) being unwilling to take fights that might look like a loss on zkill. Even in cases where group A can afford to lose 2bn isk for every 1bn they kill from group B, group A will still be reluctant to take fights where they will lose 2bn to 1bn. Zkill was a mistake in that regard, the isk-value numbers on killmails became the measuring stick for victory, regardless of the respective groups' war fund situation.

They're random.

Eve observer here, what happened? Did they actually ban those people in Jita who are like "follow the instructions in my profile and win a prize" or is this a third party thing?
---
Is internal affairs looking into this or is it beeing treated as only a bug?
---
No.
---
Also add some t3cs to it to combat scan them from a perch on grid, this causes a lot of disruption

He looks super carebear. +5 of SEC standing living in Low SEC is a little wtf.

"ensure this does not happen again"....
---
I'm guessing you're a manager or don't work. Only those two groups think that's even possible. If people assure you something can't happen again they're lying to you.
---
Gotta pay them bills somehow!!!
---
because non bots can look at log data
---
Right on! 
---
A bug doesn't deserve a public witch hunt. It deserves a fix that's tested. Perfect response as far as I'm concerned.
---
So says a player who talks up about all the planning and work on ganking and then ignores the level of planning and organisation to do a successful ninja loot scoop.   And your whining about people doing this was hilarious, you are a prize hypocrite, it was real salt there my boy.

They're all behind him apparently...

Don’t forget the higher biology implant!

I guess ratting in (slightly adjusted) pvp fits is better than not ratting at all. Having that rattlesnake unload a heavy neut on your tackle is always a bad sign at the start of a fight. Finding out the dominixes have scrams and grapplers and also self rep is not something you like to find out.   
---
I know the null's opinion on ratting in a fleet, but tbh, beats not ratting at all if that's what you want to do.
---
You're downvoted but 100% correct. 
---
Funny how they "know" about this but no exploit notification has been sent out for this obvious exploit.
---
In Low sec and all NPC null station we need to have a repair station on each. It s so dump to not have it when you know that local can use their tether to repair.
---
Because you cannot "look" at a cloaked ship warping to you but you can look at the logs to see it.
---
&gt;games where pvp is a culmination of production chains ran by players, which on the largest scales is for control of territory.
---
It sounds like you will like this game, the people making alot of noise right now thought this game was farmville in space and not what you said and it is safe to ignore them.
---
How have they messed it up for new players? I've met a shed load of new players who seem to be having fun in wormholes and low/null so I'm not really sure what you're talking about. I've done more explaining of game mechanics and helping new players out in the last 2 months than I have in the last 2 years.
---
&gt; I'm not so sure that's the case, as it's not real money.
---
For what it concerns gambling regulation in a few countries, so long as you can trade it to other players (and thus, RMT it) it's real enough.
---
Their appearances are pretty random, and people actively hunt them which makes their random appearances tend to lead to random *dis*appearances.
---
Thanks for the write up :)
---
White Sky recently gave me my first podding, (followed by some advice when requested), so some background on what the groups in this area are up to is welcome as I'm sure I'll be bumping into most of them from time to time.
---
Why is it evey time I tell someone I have 100m SP their response is "So you bought the account?"
---
Am that I bad?
---
That's a lot of mights. I know a few people who've made fortunes in the tech industry and while they've invariably gone on to other projects, mostly part financed by themselves, none of the people I know have sunk their entire fortunes into them. They've always left enough to fall back on. Most people who make a fortune are at least prudent enough to not screw themselves over afterwards.
---
Oh come on, you and a few other people in this thread talking about responsible disclosure.
---
If it was a bug that leaked private information, compromised accounts, allowed you to crash the server or anything else that is that severe I obviously wouldn't have posted it publicly.
---
But this bug is relatively harmless in comparison and it's very likely already being abused so at least this levels the playing field.
---
generally, a "fault" is reserved for a conscious direct choice.
---
Shadea  hahaha what does this person thinks he is   ?  People arent your bitch   you know
---
The number of people who warp immediately after getting an otherwise invisible packet would be pretty small
---
Just don't join one of the Null Blocs. Make your own experiences, and look from there.

Is it worth it to learn physics given that you'll be thousands of years behind?

Is it worth it to get a job given that there will always be someone that started at that job before you?

Is it worth it to plant a tree in your garden given that you have plants you already planted?

You get faction standing when you are promoted.

The problem with CO2 is the lack of gigx as a official figure. CO2 in impass was a powerhouse of an alliance.

If the client crashes that flush to disk may never happen and you lose the logs

You really need a but more range than that.

At least to snipe the commanders and move on.

Talwar should be able to do it

Take a look at your capacitor in your simulation fitting window.  Fitting a microwarp drive not only USES more capacitor, it passively REDUCES your capacitor's GJs, AND actively blooms your signature radius which makes you easier to hit.

The game runs in 1 second ticks.

Sounds like you should give SEADC a try. But you will need self-motivation.
---
This is sarcasm..... right?
---
@op
---
Many European countries are starting to crack down on video games involving gambling and lootboxes.
---
You could give SEADC/ SiCo a try. They don't really advertise themselves much, which is probably why you don't see them mentioned here, but the idea comes really close to EVE uni.  
---
 Training classes for PVP and PVE, different corps in different parts of spaces (that you can join after completing a minimum amount of time in our standard Corp). You will need to have some self-motivation, since they only offer these as options but do not force anyone to do anything.
---
Hmm, was kind of expecting the guy would also throw in the enitre microsoft arsenal but no, dissapointing.
---
Yeah unlike CO2 who had the honor of becoming a panfam meatshield before they died.
---
Morale is bad. Pvpers exhausted with forming defense fleets every 20 mins. Pve impossible. Good for the game?
---
You're significantly overestimating how much space these logs take up.
---
I would like to see eve like that

With blackjack and hookers

Yes, these people are wrong. GTA V just put in actual casino you can own and gamble at. Which also includes real money transfer to buy in game cash.

Don't take it personally pal... Most people just don't believe you earned that, since we have skill injectors and shit, the first thing that comes to other players minds was that you bought your way up there! :(

If you reached that milestone, I salute you o7
---
Not really, I'm in a small pvp alliance and I think 4 accounts / 12 toons is average and that's not including isk making alts.

No. CO2 emissions are bad.

Here's a 7 year old video of Titans at one of their most broken times: https://youtu.be/c1yBfdLDVAo

A few decent, but undeveloped ideas.
---
One side one: gatecamps won't be such a thing as all alliances now have a huge jump bridge network.
---
Special Edition ship! I am intrigued.
---
I was super confused the first time I used it. Never had an app do that and thought it was a bug. Took me a while to figure it out.

I said "what what.. "

Back in the day, a very famous player used to run a badass lottery.  Who was that?

Join Wild Geese! They would offer you that anyways.

Just imagine all the ones CCReee DIDN'T catch

I also missed those, unfortunately. 
---
Won't be able to help you out there I'm afraid.

Lol.

How do they measure activity? By attending mining ops or something?
---
Hics get a jump interdiction targeted script which jams any active running cyno beacon and prevents jumping (or makes caps land in random nearby systems at sun)

---
[This guy](https://www.youtube.com/user/ange1uk/videos) collected a few old EVE videos and re-uploaded them to YouTube. There's even [one that I made in 2004](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqtoDF3hOSk) when I was in Stain Alliance.
---
Running out of null targets on easy mode already? LOL
---
Well, even if a lot of minerals is mined in Null, these big alliances do not export the minerals that much as they need to build their own cap/super fleet. Goons do not export Super/Titan outside Delve, its/was an internal rule.
---
I agree that’s difficult to define the impact of moondrill in HS but certain minerals dropped in price since few years (Structures implementation?). Arkonor, Hedbergite, Hemorphite, Bistot was in LS/NS exclusive belts before the change.
---
Now, Megacyte, Zydrine, Nocxium &amp; Isogen dropped in prices big time.
---
Thanks all for your comments!

Dear sir, I browsed through your reddit history for 5 minutes at least just to find out who you are, what you do and where do you lurk. I WILL find you, and I WILL take your filthy pineapple pizza from you along with your miserable life (in game).
---
Sir, allow me to remind you I live in the lands of the east where there exists a thing such as the "Tsundere Pizza". Your attempts at stealing my pineapple on crust will fail utterly when you discover the true depths of our depravity.
---
stealthy gigx reddit alts rise up
---
Yeah it was
---
Seriously, there is more than enough test devices on Google console to not have to resort to a public beta; unless your studio REALLY does not know what it is doing (which from the look of the app may well be the case). Looking at the internals of the first version, it's no wonder it could not work on many devices due to the inclusion of totally unnecessary libraries. 
---
This is just sloppy work. Hire capable people before trying to engage the 15K-20K people who 
---
 aren't paid for it.
---
Yeah, here, I ranted. I''ll see myself out.
---
Betting on the alliance tournament was ace I won so much isk and then lost most of it again on the next round 10/10 would do it again
---
They have made it way too hard to close the app, bring back the buttons!
---
only way co2 reforms as an alliance is gigx getting unbanned.
---
all that "gigx's wife" was just stupid.
---
and since it doesn't look like gigx is getting unbanned any time soon...
---
&gt; and then ignores the level of planning and organisation to do a successful ninja loot scoop.
---
a ninja scoop takes as much effort or less than a ganker's inital looting operation.
---
Did I say that they take as much effort or more than the gank, are you dumb, I said it takes effort, and whining about it being unfair is dumb, which you did in this discussion.
---
I miss creating the corporation "SOMER BIink" about once a month and logging in 3 days later to collect 3 billion ISK and a warning from the GMs regarding inpersonation. :P
---
I have 3 subbed accounts at the moment however I log in and either sit in station for ages then log out or log in and be really active for a few hours so not sure how that works out.
---
it takes significantly less effort to ninja scoop than to actually scoop as a ganker, on top of that the ganker actually has to generate the content and kill in the first place, which is an imbalance (ie, a rando ninja scooping is able to profit more off a gank with a fraction of the effort and skill and risk than a ganker)
---
that's bad game design, and you can't debate that
---
Abyssal mods are basically gambling.
---
I agree that brave are good people but I believe that nowadays they've "grown up" a bit and they take the game a bit more seriously than they used to. 
---
That doesn't mean that they've become toxic people who make fun of you if you lose a venture, it just means they care a bit more about "quality".
---
You are whining, that is the same as saying people who come in and mine the moon ore of another persons Athanor in hisec is unfair and bad game design, as is ninja salavaging Trig wrecks, it is unfair and takes less effort and skill.
---
You are an entitled gankbear.
---
This!! But many people want the "easy" way - Log in, undock, warp to Anom, shoot/mine". The ability to get yourself content and income without a huge babysitting infrastructure that provides you both content and security has decreased badly the last 3-4 years.
---
exotic dancers please
---
holy fk, since when wally makes goodposts as well?
---
Yea but they have the 18+ rating etc
---
That's one thing about EVE is that you're never really locked out of anything.  As long as you can train it, you can become just as good at anything as anyone else.
---
Only caveat is alpha players have a 5M SP cap unless they buy injectors/sub, but that's because alphas are basically an extended trial rather than the full game.
---
&gt;You are whining
---
you keep saying this after i refute your points as if it means something
---
&gt;that is the same as saying people who come in and mine the moon ore of another persons Athanor in hisec is unfair and bad game design
---
it is
---
&gt;as is ninja salavaging Trig wrecks
---
it also is
---
&gt;You are an entitled gankbear.
---
you keep saying this, but you're the only one that continues to beg and benefit from developer interference
---
ahh the days of ~~saying~~ hearing "GUYS, PROMO!!!" over the sounds of your FC relaying important destination intel
---
I won't use it anymore the day that CCP decide to do a REAL "Little things" ™ initiative, an entire patch devoted for that, and so when this request is solved. Until then, I have to adapt and so I did.
---
CCP don't realize that the "Little things" ™ DO have a serious impact on the confort of playing. The game mechanics should offer a decent fight, but the UI shouldn't fight against us. It can be one of the many reasons the game has difficulties to attract people.
---
Even the "new" map is wrong. It is very hard to distinguish the links between the systems (it is more or less worse depending of the selected window "theme") unless you have bionic eyes, and this kind of little things could change a failure to a decent feature.
---
I remember that they created a topic to ask "Little things" ™ at least two years ago, who received many propositions (and this multicancel trade function was inside) but they added maybe 3/4 of them at the end and I am generous on this statement.
---
Seriously, CCP has a To-do list who go to infinity and beyond.
---
#
---
You have not refuted anything, you just dug yourself in even deeper as an entitled whiney gankbear.
---
And your content is crap.
---
Player 1:  How did you find me?
---
Player 2:  YOUR MOM TOLD ME
---
Ahhhh, EVE.
---
That's why he has "10-15 caps".  He needs to keep feeding them to eventually kill you.  *Maybe.*
---
And he'll still miss your pod.
---
wheres the "drop carriers" option clippy
---
Gay go-go dancers you mean?
---
Looking at the loss and the guy's killboard, it doesn't showed he died to CONCORD so you probably went suspect.  9 out of 10 times this will happen from trying to loot a wreck you don't own; make sure in high sec you ONLY loot white or blue wrecks unless you want others to shoot you; some people try to bait you into it.  
---
Yellow wrecks are owned by someone else, looting them makes you a suspect and anyone can shoot you for a while.
---
You no longer need to store shuttles in a citadel now when you can get a free rookie ship on demand.
---
You refuted this only in your own mind, you are a gankbear whining about the game being unfair, it was there for all to see in that interview and you did in in this thread too.
---
I'm sorry but that video is just a rip off of someone else's brilliant music and concept (Interstellar), it's not even edited well.
---
lol
---
Incredible. I think I've completely missed this learning curve and gone and done my own thing :(
---
it is unfair, as you yourself have said, it is much easier for a ninja scooper to look a ganker's wreck than the ganker himself, and the ninja doesn't even need to gank it in the first place!
---
We still don't understand each other.              
---
If something is visible in debug and is available directly, it cannot be considered exploit.       
---
Like the game is showing you this.
---
What more if this data is available in any way in the client it will be **exploited** this way or another by people scrapping it. 
---
This can be done in so many various ways that the proper way is that client should not get most of this informations unless he actually need it.
---
I said it was like, you are the one saying it is unfair, dumb twit.
---
Hilarious! I'll look into peddlin' that gas.
---
Don't worry friend! You can download the app "RobinHood" and get options approval in minutes, you'll be cutting the middle man out and throwing away irl cash in no time!
---
They seem to be! I'm gonna try to get out of my comfort zone with them and see what really is fun.
---
are you european? is that why you don't seem to understand english
---
CCP has had years to address sov mechanics and also citadel timers but seems to be more concerned with making eve a full time job while forcing the blobs to increase in size and consolidate inwards.
---
I hear Bing has some features that can assist with that.
---

Start using English properly mate.   Start your sentences with capitals, and it is European not european and English, not english.
---
So ensuring that this specific issue does not repeat by testing from PPE to PROD is very easy during QC's and is few minutes at best... 
---
It is called mitigation....
---
Actually I made the Empires of EVE video for Andrew Groen. And 3 other EVE videos. I also came in third in a CCP video creation contest. What bothers me the most is ripping off someone else's ideas without credit.
---
Filmed everything in game, wrote the music and produced the video.

You always notice the people whose gameplay has been nerfed in recent patches more than the people who actually enjoy the game.

It's not a worthy metric.

but btw yeah the game is all good
---
I say remove local from low sec. It's not fair that people can see me coming into null just by putting an alt anywhere in a low sec entry point. Also this opens the door to shutting the lights off in all of eve too!!!!
---
Those would belong to the NPC pirate factions tho, not the empires. Wouldn't make much sense for the empires to be putting up sentry guns around pirate NPC stations.
---
The stargates and the comms services *are* managed by the empires tho, not the pirate factions. Even in pirate faction "sov" (read: NPC null)

you missed that resnarth or however it's spelled dude. though from what I've seen our marinated bro seems to be afk for quite some time now

Why do you wanna nerf npc stations for no reason? they're what small groups have to use to harass big blocs
---
Thank you for writing this.      
---
I discovered EvE back then and found it interesting because it was so immensly complex and undocumented in comparison to casual games.      
---
Exploring this undocumented "monster" and having fun while figuring things out was whats kept me as a player.      
---
Things have changed, there are guides for everything in the web, every aspect has been min-maxed to the limits.       
---
Thats how gaming works today. Just a few weeks and players have found &amp; documented the most efficient ways. No exploring neccessary.      
---
I think this is what will finally kill EvE some day.
---
Says the one with the ticker of an alliance that once (in Syndicate) had a good name but then descended towards GoonPets defending QFC-Carebears against Low-Sec-Alliances and now gatecamping in tribute :-P
---
In every MMO fucking ever you have grind for materials or money. Nothing new there. I dare you to tell me it's engaging too. Very few ways of grinding materials or money in MMOs is fun. Grinding is really a player created thing as well. Doing a repetitive task over and over to increase gain in a shorter amount of time. Developers make tasks not very profitable so they don't flood the markets and created out of control inflation. Players just try to find ways around it.
---
Oh, I thought the whole thing is based on the new API? eg. ESI?  
---
Well what I've seen it was mainly using fuzzwork's Static Data Exports, but I am pretty sure the ESI is there too.
---
Speaking personally, EVEBet &amp; EOH Poker were the best platforms and those that I will miss the most.
---
I had a long conversation with a member at CCP about introducing gambling into EVE (CCP Run). Whilst it would be awesome to implement for fun, the ability to buy ISK for RL money to fund an addiction was too high a price to pay. 
---
I found this to be a very Honorable and Responsible position from CCP and on that basis, whilst nostalgia is nice, it is also nice for it to be behind us.
---
Is that the entire Miccrosoft arsenal ?

You make lore around the game, not the other way around.

---
yea ok fam
---
&gt; I could continue arguing about this (cause some of the shit youve written is, well..)
---
well, some of the shit i´ve written i have years of experience with including ratting and PvEing behind enemy lines. All of these methods are not any more tedious than your bogstandard anomaly ratting. they just require one thing: being in front of your keyboard and actually paying attention. if that is to much to ask of the average player these days than i agree that there is no point in arguing and that we should probably pull the plug right away. 
---
&gt; Whats the pull of NS?
---
currently? there is none. since the risk vs reward balance isn´t favourable. more risk in nullsec is a good thing. but rewards need to be adjusted accordingly. which didn´t happen. 
---
&gt; Fozziesov? Citadel spam?
---
both were mistakes. 
---
&gt; Cynojammers? Having to light cynos with recons?
---
an indirect nerf to one of the most OP shipcalsses in the game. i think that they should have gone for direct nerfs instead. but then again they need dumb whales to inject into these things to earn cash. super capitals were a mistake right from the start. 
---
&gt; And most importantly, why even bother with the game if its gonna be this tedious?
---
because a certain amount of boredom is part of the very core concept that makes this game work as a stable niche product. that every ounce of work you put into grinding for your shit can be gone in a moments notice when you fuck up. if you had nilly vanilly fun all the time than there would be no consequences for fucking up.
---
The only place where that core concept was kind of nullified was in large power blocs in the post 2012 era and what´s left beyond that isn´t enough to keep people engaged and has lead to years of stagnation and constant player drain. 
---
There is a reason why most long term players are deliberatly putting themselves in positions and favour gameplay styles that require a lot of ukeep and personal effort to maintain. Besides what people might say: Eve isn´t a casual game. You can play it casually, yes, but in that case your time is indeed better spend elsewhere and most people who do so will move on rather sooner than later. 
---
&gt; You guys keep focusing on the tree but missing the entire fucking forest burning behind it.
---
 
---
A forest CCP willingly set on fire because after growing tons of cheap pinetrees for years market demand has run dry and they decided it would be in their best financial interest to sell small amounts of oak furniture in the future. Are they right? I dunno. But that seems to be their busniess plan and one way or the other they´re going to piss in a lot of carebear cheerios. Which by their own admission they´re fine with.

101% agree with our little piece of LowSec being super fun to be in. It's a cool place and you guys are cool too. It's a shame that we are on opposite sides. But non-tocic PvP is always welcome.

See you next time.

PS: plz bring brawl fleets. -_-

Only do this if you want to be blacklisted from all major blocs

You mean out of fw lowsecers - all of you - are the guys I love to "hate". :)

Ha Gay!

Hmm, lets check, asset safety was introduced with the patch "Citadel" in March 2016. The months before that patch were the ones with the highest activity (ships killed, Stats were published here yesterday) and login numbers (Saturday EU prime 55-65k users). 
---
Now lets check today, the "ships killed" has plummeted dramatically, and so has the login count (Saturday EU prime atm 25-30k users). Now lets check the statistics on when that slope started. SURPRISE, it started with "Citadel" patch in 2016.
---
So I apologize that I have to call bullshit on your whole statement.
---
I mean in a game where anyone can kill you anywhere, it matters. 
---
But I still think it's worth joining. The learning curve everyone talks about it super steep, so you'll have to be patient. Also, finding a good Corp will help as well.
---
I remember Somer BLINK, I swear I made so much money on that as I would always go 50/50 on the tickets. Eventually CCP contacted me, but they were cool about it.
---
sorry can't do it without recruitment video
---
You do realize there's a whole subsection of the official forums where you can post stuff like this.
---
That said, most of the things you suggest have already been suggested several times there, and have been shot down for multiple reasons.
---
that was my understanding. KB's show they moved to placid? I used to farm them but it was a long drive out to their space from HS and no close by NPC space options.
---
Are you honestly trying to say Asset safety is making people leave??
---
What an obtuse, misguided statement. Other changes people aren't fond of are causing players to leave, not asset safety.
---
Google Nexus 5X 32GB version, 2GB RAM, Snapdragon 808, Rooted but now on Android 8.1.0 stock. works surprisingly well and thats a 2013 fuckin phone. Second Phone Moto G5, doesnt work at all :(

They also accept random fleet invites and don't exempt themselves from warp.
---
Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
---
the only reason i would get behind this is For the Co2 Diplo team
---
unfuck sov mechanics ??? naa sov mechanics atm are a problem but not the most concerning tbh . Citdales ( your place in the hell) .... is what is ruining the game which was the expansion of 2019 and 2018 together ... so untill citdales are fixed no one is gonna bother playing anything
---
I once won a Navy Thresher, I don't recall if it was in the raffles or scratch cards. That was the biggest thing I ever won, but I didn't really want it so I sold it

I don’t know whether I should be annoyed or pleased with the fact that so many people ask me “Is this copy/pasted from somewhere?"

I always write my own stuff. I’m not saying it’s good because I wrote it, but I definitely write my own stuff. It’s extremely important to me.

This is spur-of-the-moment inspiration. IF I quote, I put it between quote marks and I will mention who said it if I have that information.
---
I'm not sure about it, 100MN usualy doesn't work in WH pve, because lots of web, neut and realy fast npc (+1000m/s BS). we barely never saw 100MN VNIs in WH, and when we saw one, sleepers killed him before we could come and gank him.  
---
Face tank like a man,that's the way. Maybe a praxis passif shield can do some of data/relic in C3, but not the hardest one. he has a good tank, a nice cargo hold and a scanning bonus
---
It is People like yourself that make my Eve immersion so rewarding, Thank you.

The fuck is a tsundere pizza? Pizza with slices of a bratty teenage anime schoolgirl?

Send him to ISK to find out. It's the only way, man.
---
Found the person who will never develop a game lol.
---
Please tell me more about how lore is essential to Eve. It's early and I need a laugh.
---
That's mostly my point. Using lore as justification for this rule doesn't make any sense.
---
The design aspect would be that npc nullsec is nullsec, and behaves like nullsec in all aspects except sovereignty.
---
&gt; it matters.
---
Sure, to a small degree.

We are having the AT in 2020. I don't understand how every moron is claiming it is gone for good.

casinos brought in disgusting amounts of money. Much more and less effort required that guarding renters
---
P3XL here as well, I was curious whether it was presenting any issues for CCP.
---
we live in a society
---
Cash or ISK?
---
Dont know what's worse, some nobody threatening with dropping caps that he obviously doesn't know how to, or you thinking loyalty and friendship are not important in this game
---
Is it though? Their pets are still there.
---
My personal view on Null sec in that it should be the place where you can build you own establishment and you govern it by your own rules. This should come at the price of higher risk of losing infrastructure and in general losing all that you've built. Currently we have groups of people who live in NPC stations they benefit from the goodies in null sec however in this case risk is minimal because other players can't capture NPC stations nor they can camp them forever. People who live in NPC stations in null sec have infinite storage which cannot be destroyed. They don't need fuel to power their structures which can be expensive if you maintain a lot of them. The idea of higher risk, higher reward is not really valid.
---
FuckgigX. FTFY
---
On top of what most other replies say (and it's mostly good advice), don't worry about what happens with nullsec if you are pretty much starting out with the game.
---
First of all, half of what is nerfed will take you a while to train into anyway, and the other half you probably haven't gotten used to. E.g, if you don't know that game mechanic X is a win button or you don't have first hand experience from using it, you have no reason to be upset when they nerf it or replace it with game mechanic Y that makes things a bit more challenging, because you haven't really been affected by the change.
---
Second, according to data released a few years ago, nullsec was about 20% of the total population. Even if they all left EvE overnight (which they won't anyway, since a lot of them are very much invested in their in-game history), it probably wouldn't be enough to kill the game. If anything, it would probably make room for newer groups to start moving into null in their place and start things from scratch, resulting in more volatility, wars, explosions and fun as opposed to the currently mostly stale landscape, where there are only a handful of huge coalitions. In other words, even if null would collapse (which i don't really expect it will), it would actually be a good thing and make for some interesting gameplay again as all sorts of diverse groups would compete for power once again in a fluid landscape.
---
Also keep in mind that the end-game in this game is what you make of it. There are countless ways to make money outside nullsec and some of them are much better if you consider your time investment and your independence as part of the equation. Some require a bit of effort and time to learn but net you loads of isk after a while (eg, market trading), others are the opposite in that they don't get you that much isk but are relatively low effort, low investment situations. The way the game is right now, isk practically grows on trees, but the majority of players are too lazy to get it or try something different and combine activities.
---
The only drawback to such a playstyle is that you can't easily get into the biggest ships in the game without some infrastructure to back you up, if that's your thing.
---
The real benefit though is that none of these activities require you to train a small army of alts for specific ship classes or purposes, bend your gaming schedule, what activities to pursue and even what kind of ships to train for around the demands and needs of a bigger organization, or generally deal with all the baggage that comes with nullsec life (defending space, attending strategic ops and laggy battles, etc).
---
Personally, i have 3 characters across 2 accounts and have managed to get to a point where i treat the game as a "pick up and play" thing whenever i feel like it and RL permits. If i'm in the mood for it and have the free time to sink into it, i'll sub or plex for a month or two, play, then take a break for a month, rinse and repeat. I depend on nobody and nobody depends on me, my assets are all safe when i'm away from the game, i have a few dozen billion isk and i like flying ships that don't require more, and for the social aspect of the game i'm just using certain community chat channels that focus on specific parts of the game. You want to do PvE or industry or mining? There are public groups for that. You want to do some PVP? There are public groups for that too.
---
The existence of such loose collections of individuals is a great benefit to the game and to players who don't like to tie their entire EvE life down to one place/corp/alliance and is one of the major quality of life improvements compared to the old days. 
---
TL;DR don't worry about nullsec when just starting out with the game, most of it doesn't affect you in the slightest when you are a new or returning player. And even as an older player, null is not a mandatory end-game. I have much more fun making my isk elsewhere and just day-tripping into null for fights with one of the numerous NPSI groups that run public fleets, i can come and go as i please and there are always people available to group up with at your own convenience and schedule.
---
It's basically the difference between being in an organized military/political structure (the dominant playstyle) or playing more as a space freelancer/raider/pirate, sort of like mad max or wildlings in space. Both options are valid and you can have fun with either one.
---
10/10 would Bang him before your mum.
---
CCP hasn't earned the trust needed to assume that'll hold true. We'll see when we see.
---
Oh,okay... but why?
---
I guess learning how to farm would be beneficial as it's still pretty hard to die.
---
Well we should voice our concerns and ideas it's always worth. Maybe one day they will start listening.
---
so amazing . i started playing in 2011 it was stories like these that brought me to the game .. the epicness which is not lost in time due to injectors , rorquals and cap proliferation .. wish there was another game that cud match Eve . I dont wanna pay ccp anything anymore for ruining the game ..with patch after patch ...instead of fixing mistakes making newones over and over saying we are changing while changing for the worst
---
ISK :D
---
Why do people make same posts every day
---
Yes null is stagnant, yes NPE is pretty bad, Yes we know all of this and your post wont magicallyvfix anything
---
Also, about CCP not listening to players, they have been listening to CSM which were compromised of nullbloc people, they were chosen by players with votes, so basically it's players who made the game worse, not just CCP
---
It was a fun fight and  very reminiscent of my time in Molden Heath of old. Back when The Humbleless Crew, Capital Punishment. and Gunpoint Diplomacy ground through the bears enough that Electus Matari brought the hammer to the anvil. Fights like these are the best fights. True lowsec needs more love.
---
Horseshit. If you entire alliance was clustered in 5 to 8 system your density would be too great.

You've exaggerated more than a few times in this thread

Eve has been drying since the day it came out.  I would also not look too much into negative comments.  I am part of Dreddit, which is Reddit based corporation and part of TEST Applaince please ignore.  We are at war with Winter Coalition and i am having a blast every single day.  Yes, we are having to adjust due to recent CCP (Game Developer)changes.

something that you dont have in a fucking 700 pilot alliance, while guarding your few backwater ratting systems.
---
get the fuck out
---
Career..
---
I pity those individuals.
---
Hahahahahahaha
---
Myself know of many people who move all they have from null to High sec when changes of safety asset were hinted . The nyx BPC pack down in price in 66% in less than 45 days.
---
I think limit the space in station shelf storage is a bad idea. Basically for me , as once read, the inventory system is one of the few items Eve Online has and no other game has. 
---
As a game industrialist, you need many times space for BPC in number of items, and a big part of spce to do capitals, orcas, freighters, or massive construction. Simply you can kill industry with that change.
---
Stocks of extra bunch can have the same effect. Sometimes i had in High sec around 10-15b in minerals and planetary interactions products and use a lot of space.
---
People have already said a lot of this elsewhere, but viewing ratting as a group activity rather than something to be pursued solo really helps. Having 5-10 people ratting at once, any of whom will immediately warp in to save the person who gets tackled, makes your group a really tough target for anything small and light enough for someone to want to roam out of a WH in. Myrms and Domis also have good survivability and a slot layout that lets you fit for PVP and still get perfectly fine, if not max, ratting output.
---
So Legacy never brought gokus to a fight?
---
People still remember that he is one of the biggest backstabber of the eve history that fucked a lot of players and with that make a lot quit the game so don't worry his name will not be fogotten soon
---
ganking belt miners is just a hobby for salt mining; the money is in the transports and the bpo ceptors 😊
---
Pretty much. We can hit 0600 reasonably well; the ones that fall later than that get tough.
---
Yeaha well everyone know he is a dickhead. But noone is tracking about him or give him any attention after he didnt get in CSM this year (ISK done to buy votes HM? :-P)
---
So yeaha. Let him die in peace.
---
To clarify, you didn't corp theft, you just left the corp?  And he's this salty?
---
This is your brain on cancel culture
---
Gambling is a form of entertainment.  The majority of people who go to Las Vegas understand they are going to go home with less money.   Just like the folks that go to Disney World.
---
To add to this, they have campuses in all areas of space, high, low, null, and wormhole. You can visit and live from each campus and still have access to the normal content
---
They went missing last Tuesday too and reappeared on the Wednesday in the evening Eve time.
---
He's gotta keep the narrative to reap the "grr ccp y u fuck on lil guy" upvotes. Anyone who has had a *cursory* look at their killboard and sov realizes how full of shit he is.
---
So you can't have 100% lockdown on all your systems, boohoo. Harden the fuck up pansy, losing ships is normal.
---
That old aura voice... muh heart breaks
---
Given the amount of damage it does to society, I am more than willing to forgo that entertainment, or there needs to be vastly better safety nets around ready to catch those who fall to the addiction. Preferably taken right out of the hide of the fucks who profit from them.
---
Stats don't lie, and its asset safety that made many players leave in my segment (not carebearing but pvp-ing). The current model has not a single incentive to do the cancer that structure bash is since citadel patch 2016. 
---
Causality:
---
Citadels have not one incentive to shoot them (outside WHs) as no loot drops, and the timers went from 48h max to 10 days max (additionally timezone tanked with not a single way for the attacker left to move the timer). --&gt; PvP-Players leaving the game  --&gt; less ships destroyed / ISK farming to secure / less PLEX supply to the ingame market --&gt; ISK-Inflation/devaluation --&gt; exploding PLEX-Sub prices (by over 100%) leading to multibox-Krabs whining on reddit that PLEX is to high (while they and their beloved Meta are the only single reason for this themselves) --&gt; Krabs leaving too because PLEX too expansive
---
what are you trying to achieve here? 
---
the pansies are in a 700 pilot alliance and only have this issue in their home system. 
---
how would you think that they dont have the manpower to keep scouts? that s just retarded
---
Was it worth it?
---
I did, unfortunately though the advice was helpful it wasn't enough
---
The risk is a 100% chance of losing all your ships, and the penalties are no insurance and loss of security status, which soon entails losing the protection of CONCORD and being unable engage in any normal activity in highsec without being killed by the faction police. It is precisely because the penalties are so harsh that ganking is done on dedicated alts that do nothing else.
---
The rule of thumb the developers seem to balance around is that cost of a gank exceeds the hull value of the target, so it can only be sustainable when they are blinged or overstuffed and the loot fairy is smiling.
---
It is the carebears who cast the first stone by demanding safety in a PvP game and by lobbying for nerfs to PvP in highsec. EVE's unique niche is being the dark, dangerous sandbox PvP game where anyone can shoot anybody anywhere and where loss is permanent. Pilots need to be smart to survive and we hold all pilots to that high standard for the good of the game.
---
I miss betting on sports and other events using eve-bet. Made the AT and world cup really fun with corp mates.
---
I hope for you, would be lonesome otherwise ..
---
Brave Newbies are space capitalists.  Just saying.
---
You don’t need much. When I first entered the game believe it or not, I managed to run the game on almost all highest settings, while only running a overclocked Dual Core i7 processor. No dedicated graphics or anything. The game is not highly demanding and I also love it for that as many games now require insane hundred dollar gpus. Don’t drop a lot of cash just to run this game as almost any laptop can run the game.
---
Holy crow nice find.
---
This is a very valid point. NPC stations take away all risk of living in null and is completely overlooked. Agents in them can be replaced by agents in space or new mission structures. They would serve no purpose at that point and could be removed from null
---
Well don’t forget alcohol and tobacco and opioids. Also username includes addictive substances.
---
The point is you can't win it all, sometimes wormholes just spawn where it is. You just have to be more careful. Also, what the fuck is up with your aggression?
---
Ah I see, I misinterpreted it. I think if Sov Null gets local back via some anchorable system upgrade, it would be good to just have local on for NPC Null.
---
I'm positive that CCP reads bug reports. 
---
Again, I'm not saying that it shouldn't be made public. I'm saying that CCP should have been given the chance to fix it first.
---
Did I say lore was essential? No, I did not. But RPG games are built around lore (just as Eve was), not the other way around. I understand you don't care about lore, mostly because you don't have the capacity to understand it, but there are those who do enjoy it.
---
\_\_\_\_\_\_  
---
the joke\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_/  you   \\\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_&gt;
---
I wouldn't mind seeing more efforts made towards curbing the damage alcohol and tobacco does on society either. Opioids are already on the agenda, fortunately. 
---
Harmful addictions are an issue worth dealing with, when they have such impact on society as a whole.
---
Would an in game gambling thing (like with ISK) be subject to gambling laws of various countries?  Since ISK is (by plex selling) “purchasable” with real moneyb
---
I bet you're the smartest dude at your LARP events.
---
sorry, had a pretty bad day and this triggeeed me a bit. 
---
I still dont get how you would think a 700 pilot alliance cant spare 4-5 alts to watch the wormholes.
---
&gt; However, these sites now become too safe for bots, who can mash Dscan and dock up the instant a non-botting type ship appears on Dscan.
---
Hi, did you encounter such bots already, and if yes, would you mind telling me where. I am observing bot behaviours atm, but yet did not stumble over updated bots. Currently miost subcap ratting bots still rely on the combination of local and overview. They just added a tied 2nd bot on the gategrid next system that triggers warpout of the ratting ship if something appears on overview. Most bots never implemented dscan-triggers, as this would have caused them to warp on any blue too.
---
They could, I wasn't saying they couldn't. It'll just be manpower intensive, that's all.
---
Even the lore explanation sucks
---
Sure.
---
As I finished that comment I thought about that, but as there is no mention yet of such an item, I left it off.
---
I hope it doesn't give full local back, but maybe an actually delayed local.
---
wormholer, btw
---

Inb4 gets ganked
---
Yes.
---
I too was disappointed that there were no changes to wh gameplay.
---
Loyalty is a good trait, but it's not necessary to be friends, i meen.
---
That's actually a pretty nice visual overhaul
---
I don't larp, sorry. I also largely ignore lore in Eve. Not my cup of tea. I just know you are laughably wrong. So wrong in fact all you can do is hurl insults instead of debating.
---
Being able to visually ID holes on low shader settings is super nice (long overdue tbh), and the updated effects look great.
---
It still works pretty well against the most hardcore dps coming from the sleeper BS and neuts aren't too much of a problem with a battery PvE fit. Not saying I would recommend doing it this way as a snek could clear it more than twice as fast but it's definitely doable.
---
That's a nice visual upgrade
---
I literally don't know a single person that's under 18 on this game. I think we can take the hit.
---
how can you say "something that you dont have" tho. also all of this feelings of sorry for the poor dudes with 700 people in 41 systems that cant afford their little feroxes owie owie, against the mean 10 ppl wh fleets.

It s just unbecoming

Is Eve like any other MMO ever? Last time I checked it is extremely unique in what it offers. People grind in other MMOs for the best stuff. People grind in Eve to replace stuff they lost. Really big difference. People play Eve for the interactions you have in the game, which is hard when you are doing a boring mindless task.
---
My questions are  
---
1. How did you grow to 700 characters without a competent doctrine? 
---
2. How did you get that much space without an FC? 
---
3. Why has no one in that area deigned to evict you? 
---
4. Were you renting and the massa is gone now?   
---
5. Do your guys do PI? That can easily net billions every month so there's less complaining about losing ships. 
---
Anyways, now we know of a good place to drop our microfleets :P
---
I'm going to miss that low shader sun, it's what made eve beautiful!
---
You can only compare to dead FCON, please.

A lot of people cry about EvE state... But for a lot of people EvE is nullsec + Jita and that is it.
---
i miss it so much
---
Is Blops battleship use complete shit still or with blackout changes has it made a come back?  If so what are the new types of set ups people are running? Thanks!
---
Small Armor Repairer II  
---
Ballistic Control System II  
---
5MN Y-T8 Compact Microwarpdrive  
---
Missile Guidance Computer II, Missile Range Script  
---
Small Cap Battery II  
---
Arbalest Compact Light Missile Launcher, Caldari Navy Nova Light Missile  
---
Small Ancillary Current Router II  
---
This would likely do better. The ancillary is overtanking (this is too but is less annoying)
---
Since you can't perma-rep, you'll need to take more advantage of your range than the jackdaw would need to, but dps is also pretty low. Changing to an afterburner instead of the MWD will make you be capable of consistently repping more than the jackdaw fits do, and keep your signature down. But you'll have less maneuvarability, which is a problem since you have to be on grid so long with less damage.
---
Use Explosive over EM because the talwar is bonused to Explosive rather heavily. In most cases, sticking to your bonus is better than sticking to their weakness.
---
But get training to the Hound. It'll be able to do many l4s easily enough.
---
This looks like a fucking blast tbh
---
now thats the cloaky hunter i wanna fly
---
There is something so cathartic whenever I look at their kill board... Those fail fit ORCAs playing AFK and blowing up, it's just pretty! lol
---
How do you propose people FIGHT OVER safety?
---
link kill(s)
---
Did it stay with warnings only?
---
Eve is an MMO. Just because some aspects of the gameplay are different doesn't make it exempt from many of the core gameplay elements of MMOs.
---
Soooooooon this type of fight will be over and done with come cyno changes. KILL THE FUN!!!!!!!
---
The Mittani sends his regards.
---
Here's a [baby sloth](https://youtu.be/aaqzPMOd_1g).

Two videos I think everyone should watch:
---
Escalation Theory: https://vimeo.com/78708720
---
Titanomachy: https://youtu.be/hiz7ncRP7so
---
Yeah because I decided not to push my luck.
---
Are you ok? Why would you want to force someone to grind in a game for something that isn’t a scarce resource? The economy is completely different from every other MMO because it is almost 100% player driven which fundamentally separates Eve from other MMOs. 
---
Grinding for a common resource is idiotic. There is no incentive there. In other games you have a reason to grind, to get some cool thing. You don’t have that same drive in Eve so you lose interest and quit.
---
Fuck you sliv.
---
Sincerely, 
---
Vandete
---
Only libtards believe in this. And they tend to get owned by facts and logic.
---
Something tells me you haven't seen too many fan made nullsec war videos.
---
Here are 2 that got me into EVE years ago:
---
[The Dronelands War](https://youtu.be/Pt82_9FpbLY)
---
[MC: Tortuga](https://youtu.be/zATkOcJDjTg)
---
Err, weren't you statistically guaranteed to lose money doing 50/50 over a sufficiently large sample size?
---
I'm 6 months in and couldn't be happier with the changes. I'll be disappointed if they're not permanent.
---
/r/wallstreetbets is leaking
---
Considering nullsec pays a large bill to concord in terms of sales tax, not broker's fees, and sov costs. I think with all of the ISK sent to Concord every 2 weeks from null blocks, dropping local from null sec was extremely dumb.
---
Howdy,
---
I am not sure anymore what level of influence the CSM team has over CCP. Judging by the view of certain CSM members they were not aware of the recent changes. With regards the post - I don't read all posts in forum or Reddit and I've decided to start a conversation so people can comment and add suggestions.
---
I miss my casinos 😭
---
yeah you do that
---
Double smart
---
This, just ad splash screen in front of char creation with these fast dropdown selects, and the option to immediately start with them plus a button to enter full char creation if wanted. If you skip full creation you get a resculpt like you described.
---
Just another useless update. Wheres thr chaos?
---
AT betting was hella fun
---
inb4 some retard referenced World War Bee as “tHe CaSiNo WaR”
---
Red Dead online has Poker online now.
---
Not sure how the legality of it all works, but its there.
---
Nope. First of all, we started and fight a long time on old school subcaps. Super fun tbh.
---
But then... We are going to cyno to a recon and that is it. They cynoed to a Magus, next Will be a Rapier or Pilgrim and that is it.
---
The chaos is here on reddit when the cockwombles like yourself complain.
---
there are lies, damned lies and statistics
---
No because you got bonus points if you liquidated the ship into more somer blink tokens.
---
Usually when this issue occurs, it is because the launcher is unable to identify your graphic card. This issue often occurs after a Windows update. 
---
The usual solution to it has been to reinstall the Graphic driver.
---
Anything that is bad for goons is good for the game lmbo
---
Nice woosh, and good vids you created. Don't mind him, he is just Goons narrative warden (or troll) on this board, and as they are winning the game (or have won it last year already) ther simply CANNOT be anything wrong ...
---
So you also seen those dank CSM summit leaks.         
---
Damn some people in WH space will be angry as hell when this go public.
---
These look incredible! Really well done.
---
There's a reason CO2 fell apart after gigx got banned.
---
The only thing holding you together was his cult of personality.
---
No your wrong here. Lore is a building block of RPG's and EvE is based on lore. Our T3 ships were released based around lore, even the concept of titans are based on lore. Lore is what drives future updates and content.
---
Does your Corp not have a buyback running already? As long as your miners are actually mining, the profits from the buyback should be pretty substantial.
---
The empires pay FAR FAR FAR FAR FAR FAR FAR FAR FAR more, and require much smaller payouts.
---
The sales taxes are just small recapture of the bounties.
---
Dropping local from nullsec was great. Didn't you see the economic report?
---
we have buyback, but buybacks dont enrich the players they enrich the corp. Also can't have the buyback running if there is nothing to actually buy since people cant mine.
---
i made sooooo much isk on promo blinks.  Probably 100 billion profit over the life of the site.
---
I'll go ahead and post my paypal account so you can send me the $15.99, if you want me to play your way you can pay for my account.  Otherwise I'm going to play how I want and continue making fist fulls of isk and turning that into warships. Have fun in faction warfare
---
What you wrote is basically correct. I would not bother with eve 2019, specially given the cost to play.
---
Yeah after that info comes out WH people are gunna be pisseeddddd. But lets be honest they deserve every bit of the CHAOS coming to them.
---
i used to type "promo!" right before 1v1 fights.
---
You're the perfect dreddit member. You believe all sorts of dumb shit.
---
https://zkillboard.com/character/1119812570/
---
Maybe flying crusiers into non fw-ls? There is more than fw, just saying.
---
Ah nice with the insults, looks like you lost this argument. Thanks for proving our point that lore has a place.
---
Cause WH are below 0.0, and Null is above?
---
How about certain behaviour makes you appear in local
---
* Attacking a human pilot or NPC
---
* Mining
---
* Launching probes / drones
---
* Landing on a site
---
* Docking in a station
---
* If none of the above then being in system for 5-10 minutes
---
and "fatty, fatty boombalatty"
---
But any change that hurts goons, hurts everyone else more
---
so you're saying 40% drop in YOUR alliance or overall in eve?   
---
because eve0offline doesnt reflect that claim, thats all dude .
---
whut ?
---
I just installed it after 3 years break and was going to give it a try... sad to hear it got that bad... :(
---
Yes please tell me about how they spent all this time developing T3C and balancing them and implementing then in game, because they wanted to build on lore :)))))
---
&gt; So you also seen those dank CSM summit leaks.
---
Pastebin anywhere?
---
Damn I forgot about had
---
Sure... the only reason im talking about nullsec is that im a nullsec player and i dont know enough about impacts this could have on low or high
---
Highsec gankers would have very much an interest in low security levels around jita so i assume they could find a way to play the system. In lowsec it doesn't matter as much i guess.
---
Not any change, if they changed it so anyone currently in the Goonswarm Federation alliance was permanently banned, then I’m pretty sure it would hurt goons more than the rest of Eve.
---
[This video of an Iteron Mk. 5 soloing a Megathron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6so9AT4UydQ) is a permanent favorite of mine.
---
&gt;The current model has not a single incentive to do the cancer that structure bash is since citadel patch 2016. 
---
There is so much more to the game than bashing structures though.
---
Acting like that causes everything else negative is a very odd viewpoint.
---
I’m not risk averse. I’m just not rich. I prefer losing frigates over cruisers.  Only undock what I’m willing to lose has been drilled into me.
---
Share leaks pls?
---
&gt; The number of K-space to K-space wormholes should be increased by a factor of 10
---
I would love this
---
FF 14 has the golden saucer, which is just straight up a casino
---
Because of New Eden Syndrome.
---
I can’t play the game anymore, don’t have neither the time, nor the resources to do so. I would have to start from scratch and after years and years of EVE and building my skills and reputation in the game, that’s not going to happen.
---
But I also love it. I want it. I need it. But I hate what’s become of it. But there is still nothing like it. Not even remotely close.
---
EVE, despite my bittervet status and me being a crybaby about a lot of things, is in my opinion still hands down the best MMO ever created. WoW, Fortnite (eww), etc, may be more popular, but it doesn’t come anywhere near the complexity and freedom granted to players in EVE.
---
Damn it. At this rate, I’m gonna end up buying an omega subscription with real money, instead of ISK.
---
T3C ships are ingame because of the sleepers tech numb nuts
---
Things in life aren't fair.
---
Then use the money from the buyback to pay the defense fleet. Decrease buyback prices/increase ratting taxes if you really need more money.
---
Well newbies are not living in WH space, especially those higher tiers - and CCP is targetting the older players after all.
---
Ill wait for CCP.        
---
No reason to get banned.
---
WH’rs get everything......:)
---
Why did u have to leave us old aura :(
---
Well played sir, I bit the bait
---
do relic/data explo till you get enough isk/sp to start day tripping into wh's.
---
I love it  lol
---
Dw bb you can just pm them to me :)
---
Have you ever needed validation so bad you link a post you made three years ago, of which many people had previously talked about as well, and framed it to make it seem like it was your idea, and you made it manifest by your sheer posting ability?
---
But the 95% of newbies who never log back in, imagine if the game was cattered to them instead of a 16y old disgrunted fanbase.
---
Why do you need more than 300m isk and some low-key income from PI and occasional exploring/whatever?
---
I spent years playing the game just PVEing. Then I spent years playing mostly PVEing. I ended up with way more isk I could reasonably use and just was always watching it sit there in my wallet or Plex #. Then I finally realized I can have fun in eve on the cheap, with quicker content on my schedule, and not worry abouy grinding.
---
It probably depends on the mechanism too. 
---
Slots is all luck based, whereas poker and other card games are skill based, with luck elements.
---
Oh well, fuck it.         
---
C5+ are getting unrollable holes to C4 space with but with short lifespan.        
---
Something about to much krabbing in WH space.
---
This whole summer era sucks as much as the usual set of patches for Eve Online. Big promises and poor follow through.
---
I’m at 65m sp. I’m relatively comfortable in wh space.   I’ve been playing off and on since 2012ish. Mostly a month or two every few years (lvl4 missions mostly) until alpha accounts became a thing then started playing a lot more. Only then did I even touch low/wh
---
Haven't done missions in ages. I recently trained into Precursor ships (haven't flown one yet) so I might test them out on some easy missions.
---
I do actually read the mission text to try to get into it (usually by the 3rd mission in a row I stop)
---
What is with the Damsel in Distress getting in trouble all the time? Seriously, just leave her. She must have been saved billions of times by a million different pilots. I think she does it on purpose to draw attention. I feel like Mario.
---
just label it surprise mechanics and ur fine
---
I wish CCP would stop catering to wormhole play and focus on the the nullblocs.
---
The goal is eventually to plex my account while doing things I love in game. Maybe get the second account to be plexed too.
---
eve-offline. who needs to play when ur a degen gambler ;)
---
Fit an astero for null/wh data and relic sites. Don't do the faction sites that will blow up your ship if you fail the hack. If you're diligent with your scanning and don't take any chances, virtually impossible to die. 
---
Good practice for learning not to chase the rabbit :)
---
Dont want to become the new brisc, I dont have icelandic lawyers working for me.
---
5 * for the find. Bravo!
---
I use R&amp;D agents often to recover losses in the exact same situtation, i forget about them for long periods, accrue Research points till i badly need the isk, then bam....150mill in datacores. But to be honest my wallet always varies from 500mill to 1bill and hardly above that...so it might not be the best strategy in your case
---
So this just allows groups who live in C4's to farm crabs who farm C5 statics with unfightable numbers.
---
It's "a change" but not a very well thought out one and pretty narrow in scope.
---
POS were by far the strongest content driver, you could reinforce it in 5 minutes on a Friday and create content for your group on the same weekend. And you seem like one of the guys that has not understood EVEs economic system. If no Structures (ISK &amp; resources) get blown up less Ships (ISK &amp; resources) die. That causes PvE farming to be to safe, increasing farmed ISK and Ore (proven by all stats and MERs, and CCP economist Quant predicted this in 2016 but got fired for this, he was right 100%). Also trading citadels diminished one of the most reliable ISK-Sinks (hope you know what that term means) from the game, NPC trading taxes &amp; broker fees. 
---
So if the amount of ISK and Resources in a closed economy rises exponentially while the amount of ISK and resources being destroyed is stagnating or even falling you get an inflation 8basic economic rules). Thats where we at right now. ISK is devalued because of riskless afk-Multibox-farming (before blackout) and less non-PvE-Players putting PLEX into the market causing PLEX-Sub to explode from once 300 Mio ISK for 30 days to over 2 Billion where it was lately, before unsubbing afk-farmers and bots took pressure from the ingame PLEX market.
---
I do have two fitted asteros. One for wh explo and one with a dual repped 3pt scram for hunting ventures.(it’s a hobby)
---
hahaha yeah i saw it too.. for a second tho i thought i was trippin.
---
Yea. I saw the terrible economic report where Concord paid more out in sleeper blue loot than bounties in nullsec. I also have seen the player count reports where the peak logins are slowly falling off, and people just arent coming back to the game night after night like they used to in the past. Have you seen any official word and evidence from CCP to show the validity of their claims the blackout is good for the game?
---
If the Empires pay far more taxes then how do they do it without ratting? Do they just print ISK and hand it over? Jita might be the biggest market in highsec, but how does it compete with a delve time unit? The economic report is a laughable bunch of statistics where CCP cant even show the right data.
---
I honestly don't believe you lel
---
That isn’t anything I’ve ever heard about.... is that in the agency window?
---
it's three years later, should that shit taste be in your mouth?
---
You're confusing foresight with hindsight, probably since you didn't exist in our community when the horrible thread was created. Because you didn't.
---
Careful now, your ego might be so big you might not fit it into your capsule
---
I figured the answer to my question was yes.

user /u.SylnnSevern rage downvoted 3 seconds after posting. He's either rainman or got dumpstered emotionally over the goofiest bait.

I hear they are adding to glowing effects to spod rocks. As well as the character portrait slowly showing increments of progression towards spod brain.

Only thing better than a single carrier is a single super.  I highly recommend dropping supers on nano gangs.
---
At 65M SP you shouldn't be running hauler missions for isk really, unless it's what you enjoy. If hauling is your thing you like doing, maybe check into being a part of PushX? I'm not entirely sure how it works but it's gotta be better isk than hauler missions
---
&gt;Not everything can be countered by dropping caps.

It should at least certainly read:

A corp member suggested deleting the registry entries for eve, which resolved the issue :)

Thanks for the reply though!

With that 300m, expend 200 in a entry level Battleship for join warp to me incursions.

It’s something I can do while editing video, cooking/laundry etc while still getting rep up with caldari state.(still in the negatives). It’s passive isk/LP

Fond memory of winning 11b on a 11/1 bet on some random soccer game in the Middle East through Evebet. I got the bug and proceeded to lose 74b in less than 2 weeks. Eve taught me to be cautious if I ever go to Vegas. I do miss betting on the AT matches though. That was seriously so fun.
---
Is there a channel for that?
---
Thanks guys!
---
I played it for the 2 weeks trial back when it was fully subscription based, but then life happened and I couldn’t put the time in that is necessary to learn the ins and outs.
---
Soon I will get some downtime and I loved it when I tried it, I love massive space games, so I would really like to check it out again.
---
Was just afraid that people don’t look kindly on new players.
---
Any suggestions on whom to join, that is newbie friendly and active?
---
Thanks very much for the help!
---
I had a script on a Raspberry Pi just automatically entering promos for me.  Even stopped updating it because I was lazy and didn't really care, so I think they finally banned me about 18 months later.  Even then I don't think I was anywhere close to 100 billion.  Did finally get a rorqual I remember as one of the last things.

BREAKING NEWS: 17 year old goonfag wanks to his own post history, decides to tell everyone about it. More at 11.

If you're looking for semi-AFK able income, PI is basically just maintainence of picking things up when they're ready. Once setup is done it boils down to hauling. If you enjoy it it might be fun to set up some PI in a few systems and run around taking care of them. Or the logistics of doing it in a wormhole where you have to find your way out as well.
---
Yeah good that we all want lootboxes in eve right?

Abyssal stock would be realistic then. A futures contract would run good or bad depending on the stats of the Abyssal modules invovled.

I read CCP listened to the CSM now the game is bad a lot, and it doesn't correlate with CSM members who say "we told them it was a bad idea and they did it anyway". Being that CSM members say this and they were there, and you say what you say and were not, I'll assume they are telling the truth.
---
Also CCP is the game dev. Responsibility and accountability rest solely on them.
---
....the blue ball has a face in it.
---
so you have zero interest in making your content, gg fuck off
---
Research agents are a special kind of NPC agent that instead of giving out regular missions, it "starts" a project with you....and you accumulate RP instead of LP.
---
At some point you can cash in that RP in datacores and then sell them on the market, eve uni wiki has info [here](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Datacore_farming).

get standings up for factions. train up science skills.  and look for a lv 4 R&amp;D agent in the faction you raised standings in

Good isk recovery. Go explore in sansha space. Just fit a relic analyzer with explo ship of your choices. So provi catch stain eso period basis? Think that's them all. Intact armor plates are very valuable and can turn into t2 armor rigs or sell as is
---
What things do you love and why arent you doing them more already? Dont make grinding for plex work. You play the game for fun not a chore
---
potato mode is going to look a lot less potato
---
Finally some good changes for J-Space. +1
---
In all my years, I never quite figured out research agents and now I need datacores. Who has the best guide?
---
Unless you are experienced with WH exploration, I'd recommend you start in a heron or another T1 explo ship. Save the Astero for when you're well experienced and what i mean by experienced is successfully escaping exploration killers.
---
oh no
---
Are you going a little over the top in your defense of yourself and if so, how should I interpret the data? What's the business with pedophile points?

The people who click that up and down shit (you, provably) seem to care enough; you got called out by me- this would appear to be a less than epic reversal and a poor choice of direction.

They won in 2017, but hardly anyone noticed and no one said anything
---
That's boring and miserable. Unless you've been playing for years and years and have PI farms and whatever set up, it is best to use real money to Omega. Otherwise you're just working in game instead of doing the things you really enjoy
---
&gt;There was basically nothing in terms of competition within the genre.

Eve used to have several competitors in the early days actually. They all died.

\[...\]  Blue field lines: allows destroyers and smaller to pass through  \[...\]

Does that mean you cannot enter a WH like this with an industrial, for the example like a Wreathe ?
---
Think I had some items in Provi before the faction station changes a year or so ago... might be time for a weekend trip.  Pack up my base of operation orca with a couple of explorers. set up in nearest high sec and dive back into null!  Thanks for the suggestion
---
And why all this hate towards goons? We are clients too we pay with our credit cards.
---
Be more organised, goons are better than all of you cause all of you are bad.
---
Is that in multiplayer or singleplayer? And in gta5 the (multiplayer) casino is not accessible to players from countries where online gambling is illegal.  
---
So i'd assume it's the same for RDR.
---
Maybe for u but my gameplay got totes buffes
---
But everyone should know, I'm in all the best wars, a better pilot, better killboard. Freshest dudes, hottest restaurants. Everyone loves humble characters.
---
Ya welcome. Once you get used to null you can spend the isk get you a zigma data analyzer and black glass implant.  If you dont know about that life hack yet. Like 300 mil together but let's you 1 shot things in the mini game
---
Sure it might not be that way for you but not everyone is playing for 13 years.
---
Ouch that hurts, that must've been when the ishtar meta was right around the corner too. Double ouch.
---
Get into the wormholes and scan there for the pirate relic sites and in null sec, everything else is not really worth the time
---
No thanks
---
I know that ratting fleets have never really had active escorts, but maybe the Chaos age will force large entities (well sov holding groups) into active escorts of their krabs and bears.  Just a thought.
---
Explo in my opinion is best starting path in eve. Get a bunch of t1 frig you like. All the fits are cheap. Make millions in wormholes and null in a site. I've made 300 mil in a single sansha site bc intact armor plates.
---
Yes, in the middle of all the F2P games and many other games going F2P, you figured out that the game you play *might* go the same way.
---
You're a fucking genius, mate.  Nobody else figured that one out.  You're the only one to make a post like this back then.  The ONLY one.  The ONLY one.  Because nobody else is as smart as you.
---
I see alot of post there about F2P bumping up the player count. Did that ever happen? How might it reflect in the current player numbers?
---
"US people have a tendency to hold it in"? for real? From the point of view of someone leaving in Europe, you are spilling your feelings and crying more than our most dramatic girls. Seriously guys stop talking about your feelings and emotion or you pathetic depression bullshit every time. Feels bad for you sometimes.

---
I just found the second smartest man in the room. It's that power of perception that makes top notch eve pilots.
---
Ok this is highly nerdy because it is just a game but just like real life- make a budget to keep yourself from spending out of control. 
---
Set aside 50% of your income aside to buy the tools needed to bring in more and more isk.  Use 25% of your income towards plex(think of it as your rent money to play the game).  And do whatever with the other 25%.
---
Out of curiosity, are you allowed to keep it plexed and training, without playing on it, so that if you part ways with CCP you can pick up where you left off and not be 7 years behind on updated skills and such?
---
Flair checks out.
---
Relic and data sites in Highsec are generally terrible, although good for practicing.
---
LS fairs slightly better but not so much. 
---
NS is the higher tier of exploration with the better loot per site (naturally) and the blackout ( no local) makes it particulalrly appealing for the explorer. These sites are typed by region (certain pirate sites in certain regions)
---
In WHs you will find all the pirate types, aswell as WH specific sites. The WH specific sites will have NPCs, which you should read up on before trying out. The pirate sites will generally be NPC free (google the site name before warping in if unsure).
---
Another point to consider is that many of the entry points to NS (and LS) can be camped, argueably these are the more dangerous systems for you entering and leaving. So therefore WHs offer you a means of getting to and from the more dangerous regions, along a less predictable path.
---
Hopefully that helps?
---
I feel like your second sentence here answers your own question.
---
Good fucking riddance
---
Send me your isk and I'll be your friend
---
Yeah that helps somewhat, I’ll try going into lowsec next time and maybe tryout a wormhole.
---
We did already 6 months before Lifeblood (on patch note releas) but we were just unimportant lowsec scrubs, so who cares what we say.
---
I'm aiming to fly only sexy ships, orthrus in particular, but maaaaaybe, someday i'll fly a green chimera
---
So now you have no escape
---
ah so you salty cause you are bad. its ok, be better.
---
I havent seen my eyes bleed yet. I still dont feel stress levels of having to be on medication. Hilmar has failed once again.
---
(Hopefully one day they will also incinerate anything that gets on their insides, but sadly, today is not that day.)
---
SO  one day when we  travel near sun we will damage our ships?  what about bumping someone into star?
---
Y'all turn it from a fun game into a fucking *chore* you have to pay to partake in.
---
After a brief overview, you have anger issues my friend. 
---
Your liberal use of faggot kinda makes you a fag.
---
you are aware that eve is a subscription game yes?
---
Emphasis *game*
---
yes i am having fun!
---
Might be the longest “long game shitpost” to date.
---
Ok
---
I got to where I was winning multiple promos per week every week.  Earning tokens to play was super easy and cheap as along as you didn’t collect winnings and played everything on the promos.
---
2018 does not qualify as nostalgia, and that video features less than 5 seconds of actual explosions, has multiple shots of titan blobs bumping around, plus potato graphics and fps drops(lol). Now, if you want some \[REAL NOSTALGIA...\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqoxRcP5kbo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqoxRcP5kbo)) Granted, it's not a fan video, but what you went and found is not nostalgic so we're even.

Signal Cartel is a wonderful exploration corp. They have strict rules about avoiding pvp though.
---
https://www.signalcartel.com/about
---
Nowhere in EVE is safe. Use D-Scan to look for ships, and 'Show Info' on any structures inside the wormhole to see which corps 'live' in the hole. Pull up those corps/alliances on ZKillboard to see if they actively kill explorers and what time zone they're active. If they don't seem to actively PvP, or if they're on a different time zone than you, you're relatively safe. And even if you aren't safe, you're using a ship worth 3m ISK to hack cans that can pay out 20m+ -- you'll come out ahead in the end.
---
So my advice would be to try either WHs or NS(via WHs). As i said LS isnt much better and is as dangerous as NS, from an exploration point of view.
---
Thanks! I’ll check those out.
---
Always assume that U will get into fight, whenever click Undock button.
---
why are you copmplaining then?
---
i gambled there and lost about a billion isk a day
---
Page doesn't work for me in three different browsers.
---
Thanks for this, i think i have about that that many years built up. i forgot all about them.  I guess i'll let them sit longer.  Maybe one day CCP will combine all datacores into one type and they will then be worth LESS than what they are now.
---
There are wormholes that last more than 24 hours?
---
so you get triggered. Op success.
---
But that's just stupid luck then.  I mean most of them had 200-500 slots or so if I remember, and you could only have one ticket on each.
---
I always look at the bottom line, which is revenue.  Eve produced the following from chart 6.  (Converted using today's conversion rate between South Korean Won to US dollars).
---
Q4 2018		10.6M dollars (US)
---
Q1 2019		12M dollars (US)
---
Q2 2019		12.3M  dollars (US)
---
I'll be interested to see if there's a decrease or flat revenue in Q3 2019 given the "Chaos", as there are less people in space.  If it's flat or an increase, Eve players are still paying for the accounts but just may not be playing as often.
---
However demonisinf a innocent alliance is not fun and if goons leave CCP is done.
---
Stop doing things you aren't enjoying.
---
 Period.
---
 What were you going to do with the isk you earned? Buy ships presumably? What were you planning on doing with those ships you're grinding to earn? THAT is what you should be doing. THAT is how you should make your money, even if that means having less.
---
It's not safe but you can make anywhere from 5 mil to over 100 mil from one site. Use cheap t1 exploration frigates and take the loot back to highsec as often as you can. Make a bookmark somewhere in mid-warp, warp back to it and scan down the sites from there, you'll be a bit safer. Once you're in the site though you're basically a sitting duck. Keep the directional scanner open and set to 360 degrees, refresh the scan often and look for Combat Probes or Scanner Probes that don't belong to you.
---
Use [anoik.is](http://anoik.is) to identify what kind of wormhole you're in. You're looking for C1, C2 or C3 wormholes since those have the pirate data and relic sites that you're looking for. Don't go to any sites that start with Forgotten or Forlorn or stuff like that, those are sleeper ones with npcs in them. Stick to the ones with Angel, Serpentis, Sansha, Guristas or Blood Raider in the name. Don't forget to bookmark both sides of every wormhole you go through so you can find your way back without scanning them all down again.
---
Even if you get ganked sometimes (and you probably will) the isk is worth it. Easily the best paying thing you can do as a new player.
---
im okay with that.
---

---
This just reminded me that I started a couple research agents a bit over 3 years ago.  I wonder what they’ve been up to.
---
I found this to be offensive at best, do you even read my work?
---
&gt; There have been threads before. Many of the years - some eons old. But we have EA on our side these days and a slew of changes that we did not have before.
---
I correctly predicted that people would make threads before I made mine about f2p in that very post. Peel back the layers. When you're reading up 50 I.Q. points you need to use a decoder ring to find the true divine meaning. It's all there clear as day and still people are less than pleased. Don't act like you know what being a savant is.
---
In my country, if you don't jerk yourself off nobody will. If that doesn't speak to my poor existence what ever could.
---
Okay, I'll bite. How is that?
---
I play on a 1080p ultra-wide @60fps, this game is not a shooter, FPS is not the end all be all.
---
Pick a resolution that will allow you to run your main account at Max settings and enjoy the scenery and don't worry about FPS.
---
TL:DR. EVE is just as playable on &lt;10 fps as it is at 30 and only marginally better at &gt;60 for aiming bombs and lances.
---
I am ok if they pay me all they owe me after a 10 year eve career. and then multiply that by the number off all goons. yeah can you say bankrupt? 
---
On another side i hope your internet provider does that to you just because he does not like your face
---
Sure you could, but some of us enjoy sightseeing and hauling lets us do that
---
Who are you even talking to?
---
eve didn't go F2P.
---
they just stopped trial accounts expiring.
---
Obviously to US people
---
Is there a way to bring a sort of gambling back to the game just like our big companies find ways to pay less tax?
---
Additionally, consider running wormhole sites as a group. It's good income in short bursts, it's something different, and as a wormholer honestly I'm not likely to scan the OTHER wormholes in your system to see if you're ratting in them. This focuses down your defensive entry points to maybe 2 or 3 wormholes to throw scouts on, instead of trying to protect your whole constellation from 7 or 8 wormholes.
---
Also, yeah, standing fleets.
---
[Heres one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YmoUSPCXlzk) from 2009, including sounds from Microsoft messenger occasionally going off in the background.
---
grap a shitty instawarp frigatte and snatch loot from fights or FW. tap into zkill and a few channels to see where shit is going down and reek in those billions without doing boring PvE. i kickstart alphas that way. takes some planning to set up and some experience with where and when to look and comming up with a logistical infrastructure to sell the loot without much time investment. also pisses off plenty of people so that´s a plus.
---
At least its some real eve drama.  Not like the crap here on reddit.
---
That's a big increase in revenue, what made it happen?
---
greetings from DHSJ!
---
Now that sounds like something different and fun. You have a fit?
---
Can a legion do DED 10/10's? or the drone combat sites in the drone lands? I would go on singularity but its a very long exercise to do this. Does anyone know for sure? I see no videos showing the legion doing this-- always the tengu.
---
I'm away till tuesday but pm me your ingame character name, i will send you some fits/tipps n tricks that could help you find your own way.
---
I explore myself in a combat fit heron or scanning ceptor, they are cheap and you can replace them very fast if you get blown up.
---
PvP can happen everytime since there is no local in null/wh space :)
---
actually the top line is revenue
---
RIP Low Quality Sticker Suns
---
Man that double large shield booster tengu must be fearsome
---
Way back when, I lost my mission running typhoon because of some silly reason. I totally didn't have the funds to replace it and had to start over.  It really sucked. But this game can't be exciting without having real losses.
---
I kept that crap fitted typhoon I used to run level 4s sitting in Dodixie "just in case" for years after I moved on to better income sources.
---
BTW, level 4 missions are some of the most boring content Eve offers, but that lesson struck home.  Have multiple backup income sources.  Today I make isk through: stocking remote markets, PI, DED sites, and relic sites, but I am capable of doing a lot more if I move out of lowsec.  But that's where the fun is at =)
---
i use atrons with inertias at the very start and then switch to drams or sunesi (depending on how often i want to drop off loot). all &lt;2 sec align times. interceptors for null when omega. salvagers to salvage T2 wrecks for that sweet armor plates and stuff. takes some getting used to but can be pretty fun and rewarding. payout depends on activity and your balls. sometimes just downright luck. sometimes you will roam for an hour and just loot shitty frigates for 8-10 mil each. sometimes you hit that jackpot and watch that blingship clusterfuck which can make you a few bil in a few seconds.
---
It’s almost like you could completely avoid being ganked by being intelligent
---
I actually like your ideas.
---
Thinking Ishtar would be best right? Just drop drones set aggressive? Easy undistrubed hacking. Plus low slots for that desparately needed tank and mods for scanning mods?
---
Might actually try this for memes
---
So if zkb links below are correct, they live in Spire, which prompts very simple answers for 1 and 2:
---
1)  Drone regions are mostly abandoned and free for grabs 
---
2) No one cares enough to do it
---
I'd argue that it is actually good (compared to old status quo, where powerblocks would control 10 regions around them, while never actually needing them, like dog in the manger). Or at least better, healthier for the game. 
---
Shame there are not many groups that might fill the nullsec vacuum, and what little there is is going to be farmed to extinction
---
Nope, it's banned and not permitted to be accessed while I work at CCP :)
---
See my above comment with link. It has eve uni datacore guide
---
Thanks
---
So why not update them heckin' blurry moons and planets?
---
They’re blocking my view of Abe! How rude.
---
A fleet jumping through the wh looks awesome now. Flash flash flash and a bunch of little ripples.    
---
Cool!     
---
I do wonder how bad a system has to be to use low shaders as my integrated 2200g runs it fine on high everything but AA. Maybe Intel integrated?
---
Should the art team start iterating on Citadels?
---
https://youtu.be/rSYqChwfGB8
---
When it doesn´t affect you it is suddenly okay?
---
Fuck the guys living in NPC null, right?
---
not yours, but the other guys :)
---
man that VETO corp/alliance logo looks dope as hell
---
My suggestion is to go for passive isk sources - build up some steady income from either doing PI, market trading or reactions. PI has the lowest input to reward amount you can get - you can start doing it in just about any null alliance or if you want to stay in high/lowsec I suggest just finding a crappy C1 or C2 wh that isn't good for much else. With two chars you can easily make 2b a month if you set up right.
---
That was an awesome write up. I laughed. Lowsec sounds pretty cool!
---
Hnnng 🤤 🍆 🖐
---
People injecting into rorquals and supers.
---
An attempt was made.
---
They are NOT random. All 3 invasion today have "force withdrawing". if you look zkill you will see that exactly a week ago their activity fell in the same way.
---
These are the current frig holes. They have a max jump mass of 5 mil so only frigates, destroyers, porpoises and hics with a mass entangler can fit through.
---
Am I looking at the Amarr FAX machine?
---
Yea. Some c6 to space wormholes have a 48 hour lifespan
---
The revenue labeled Eve isnt just Eve Online. Its Eve Online, Aether Wars, and other projects CCP is licensing its IP out to. I think the big tell tale will be when Eve Echoes starts taking real money on mobile and seeing how it goes.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kt98_yJZVxU
---
buy back does not work if there is nothing to buy. Your solution to the car being out of gas is to drive to the gas station to pick up gas.
---
The whole issue is line members cant make money. Decreasing member payout and increasing taxes is the last thing someone would want to do.
---
back when  eve had the in-game web browser
---
https://imgur.com/a/pq0ax
---
are you from Texas?
---
ya I'm starting to think that as well. Might be the new meta for krabbers to pay for defense fleets as active support.
---
Isn’t this just multiple bosons
---
That’s what your supposed to do, buy plex to make CCP happy, income generation is a thing of the past now it’s generated with a credit card
---
ya not a bad idea as well. Group activity and can make isk that way
---
we have buyback, but thats the issue, they cant mine. Cant use the profits to pay for defense fleets if the buy back is running dry since line members cant get out there. Its a chicken and egg cycle that is hard to break. I've just been putting my own isk into the equation to try and break to the cycle so far.
---
Truth. We might have our gripes with the game but it sure does look pretty.
---
Made me think of this https://images.app.goo.gl/jYVqXTGKxdukcogb9
---
Art team in citadels, security gran on accounting, everyone else does skins. Obviously.
---
Used to do a C5 fleet with Battleships/Basilisks/Guardians depending on what people had on hand. It's 200 mil (ish) per site, so you do a site for every person present and it's decent iskies.
---
No, but Texas law applies as we all know.
---
ya all our experienced players have been doing that and thats what has been keeping us going. The people I'm worried about is the newer bros. Its hard to tell them they cant make money. And even when we hand them ships its not like they dont have other things that they want to buy themselves. Things like implants and explo ships and other stuff.
---
yes, the beautiful floating cathedral
---
Yeah thats what I'm pretty much turning to this thread for 
---
"hey guys we are facing challenges anyone in a similar situation have suggestions?" 
---
Instead I got maybe 10% advice and 90% "just go to high sec scrub" like its no wonder the mega blob is the only viable meta when that is 90% of peoples outlook on the game.
---
But give a ship a 7 minute invulnerability button, because it relies on others for support from a lore perspective
---
Most likely their shift to catering to whales.  Good for short term profits, terrible for the longterm health of the game.
---
Seems great
---
Only exception is ghost sites. Those will blow you up in hisec if you linger
---
Everyone in this game plays the way he wants within the frames set by the developers. Your main argument is that somehow other playstyles need you to be a fat nullsec krab because «pvpers need people to build ships wawawawa... ». This is just false. Nobody else in the game needs you in any way. They do need some krabs but there are plenty of ways to satisfy this need outside of nullblob farming paradise. So you can enjoy your new opportunities or not, nobody really cares. You can try to impress ccp with your wallet but don’t think your existence is meaningful or important for the rest of the players, if you’re not willing to interact with them you might as well not be there.
---
They need to replace their aging developer population
---
I made billions and billions of isk.  You lose on the generic auctions, but with smart play and minimizing risk you don't lose much, and after doing this for a short time you have an assload of promo tokens.  After doing this I spent 6+ months with a Somer tab open at work and only played promos.  So.  Much.  Money.
---
Looks amazing. Would love to try it out,  but CCP still owes me reparations
---
Flying Pope hat is beautiful
---
Depends, if you have an office job and kept a tab open at work you could easily play 500+ promos a week.
---
Just have some general advice for the game: no reason to feel like a failure. In my opinion this game is all about executing plans in a challenging environment that will cause many plans to fail. Either you gain the satisfaction of succeeding, or you should learn something new and apply it to your next idea. If you're trying to ween yourself off plex income make sure you consider how long it takes to replace the ships you use to generate income vs how often you're likely to lose them.
---
And if you just need a way to make solid cash, you said you're familiar with WHs, so harvesting C5 gas can be very lucrative in a ship that takes about 1 cycle of gas harvesters to replace.
---
WTF CCP, my computer running Windows 2000 and a voodoo card won't be able to run this. Why don't you support older systems?
---
Yeah, but if you were smart and played the long game, you could actually be net positive by a lot because of the way promos worked.
---
What? The Empires run thousands of planets with trillions of people on them.
---
CCP needs to understand their own lore and at least have a rudimentary understanding of the science in their own universe. Roughly understand how things works. What all the bits and bobs do. Understand what the ship is being built for. And who it was made by. Primarily the design philosophy and culture of the people who designed it. Or even the corporation who modified it. I mean the Sebiestors even designed and built portions of the Imperial Navy. It would have been cool to feel a slight sense of that Sebiestor pride amongst all that gold. Honouring the lore is the best way to get people invested and immersed into your universe.
---
And I have and still do have regular bouts of depression thank you very much  
---
I'm also a fulltime carer for my wife, who is a PTSD sufferer aswell, gaming, including a bit of EvE from time to time, is an outlet from what gets us down
---
From the lote, 1 ISK is supposedly what ea h person makes in a year.
---
That isn't accurate.
---
It fell-apart because CO2 lost their space and all their assets.
---
That's a pretty big hit for *ANY* group!
---
The re-spin failed, even with gigX present, because the members that were key to the community didn't return ... then they again lost their space.
---
The move to Fade was ill-advised, and the idea was that maybe more fights alone would make-up for the community deficit.  It didn't.
---
Requires flash.
---
Make your crabs crab the wormholes when you have them. They are an opportunity in disguise, great isk for your ratters.
---
Lol, good meme
---
Well I am only interested in pvp only, as I learned playing wow that battlegrounds was the only fun feature. Everything else pve wise, made me feel like sticking my ball sack in the blender, Eve being a slight exception. I will state all these games does have significant pve additions of industry like Eve though if you are into the pve side of eve.
---
So with the above intro, right now Camelot Unchained for FFA pvp that your faction helps take and hold forts that utilize voxels. Not a 100% eve like sandbox, but for me it will scratch the pvp itch as it is close to release as it is in beta at this point.
---
Next, Crowfall, which I won a key from a streamer and will say it is a bit rough on the edges right now. Their unique thing is that power creep you see in Eve is non existent as they go off a campaign system. Worlds open up for 6 month to a year and so full loot pvp and if you get stomped by a big entity like Goons your outfit can just leave and join another one starting soon. Not sure if if it will be released, finger crossed as it was a bit fun for pre alpha.
---
Ashes of creation which I am not sure about. But gist is player nodes and pve content unlike Eve on top of pvp. Think you can download their combat system now?
---
Chronicles of Elyria which is hardcore version of Eve with almost perma death. 99% of the people in Eve are going to avoid this because they don't want to re level a char which I heard was minor set back.
---
Then you have the most Eve like game that I am pretty damn sure a large portion of the community is sitting and watching. Dual Universe which is again voxels, and the head guy at least was a Eve player himself from what I heard. I am going to pick up a supporter pack later this year to get an idea how the game plays. 
---
Finally, which is far off in the future (but imo death nail for Eve if it is good) New World. Basically like Ashes, but differences is 1. they are backed by Amazon and 2. they are using AWS to take the load off the servers so players can do massive battles. Amazon has a lot riding on this because their games division sucks shit compared to even Epic and so this will get a lot of people to jump on to their distro.
---
There are probably more that I lost track of. But these posts of Eve going to truly die because of dev's/etc are mainly people with an agenda butt hurt over changes. The reason why this time Eve will die for sure is that there are actual competitors. Hence why I did my fail rant on another thread because we are looking at the next few years before these other titles take the headlines. 
---
Expect significant player drops I would say in 2-3 years at least. All the titles are only delayed by max 1.5 years and 2-3 by Crowfall/Chronicles of Elyria because of dev size or poor decisions on engine choice.
---
Always remember that in case of emergencies, your sp is your isk. Extract some skills that you don't use and you can make a couple of billions easy while still retaining all the skills you use regularly. 
---
Best way to start from square 1 is to extract some sp.
---
wow
---
Even if gigX returned, CO2 would never be the same again, as the members are what made CO2 what it was, not gigX alone.
---
And your argument is "bull sec makes too much money they need to play the game like I do" so where are your high sec fleets? Link your zkill to show how let you are because you obviously dont understand the market or economics
---
More like CO5 or more at this point.
---
Join the aesir and make sweet c5 isk with us (we live in a c2 with c5/ns static)
---
My brother wanted to play eve just to play EOH poker.
---
I actually saw Crowfall mentioned elsewhere and it seemed like a cool concept, I just forgot about it. As far as the others go, I'll be looking into those now to see what they're all about.
---
You beat me to it, well spotted.
---
&gt;English is my first language. I’m just an idiot.
---
Ya it’s also easier to sell “group ratting” in a WH Vs normal sites. Just a psychological thing

---
Was the trig frig attacking the freighter for 50k hp while it was being bumped or something?
---
At least they still let you gank miners with CODE.
---
Something I've always wondered about if it's viable: protection vexors that carry a flight of mining drones and mine when there is no pvp. And something else I wanted to try because my corp is moving to lowsec is doing the protection fleet with force recons, because they won't show up on dscan for approaching hostiles.
---
don't be a fearmonger; it's almost impossible to catch someone who's genuinely playing for both sides.
---
a good spy willy only be slightly easier to catch. There are guides for that too.
---
Out of curiosity I checked Edea's KB, looks like that kill [inspired him to ragequit the game.](https://zkillboard.com/character/90018480/)
---
Would recommend basing yourself somewhere near the edge of hi-sec with a connection to null a few jumps away, with preferably not too many low-sec systems in between. From there what you do is check the Map for information such as ‘ships destroyed in the last hour’, ‘pilots in the system in the last 30 minutes’, and though these are not 100% reliable given the information could change from one minute to the next, if you see a long line of systems with 0 activity, you might have just found a good path into null. In my recent experience doing exactly this, in addition to wormholes, I’ve found that null is much more reliable isk/hour, easily coming out of trips with 100-300mil, admittedly in a covert ops ship, but with otherwise 0 encounters while hacking or jumping. Wormhole scanning can take a painful amount of time and you might just be scanning down other wormholes for an hour, or finally hit 100% on a level 3 data site just for it to be a sleeper site (dangerous NPC’s). On top of being harder to be aware of your surroundings and having to worry about your entrance/exit locking you in.
---
I hit the monthly jackpot tier 1 once.... made me loose all intrest in eve though.
---
They did pay out though
---
To add to this, if you're in lowsec or nullsec and see nothing but Rogue Drone combat sites and wormholes, just leave the region. Rogue Drones are the newest faction lorewise, and thus have no exploration sites of their own since they're all supposed to be ancient ruins from the faction.
---
It’s sad how much truth gets downvoted around here.
---
1. Market-wise: Bowheads, Orcas, and Freighters mark the lower end of capital class ships. Operationally, some capsuleers might argue those three aren't quite caps because they don't have jump drives.
---
2. I can't speak for the goons, but my impression is that they just arrange fights for the sake of fighting in nullsec with likewise bored alliances. For instance, they help TEST keep their highsec keepstar safe, but in null they often kick eachother's asses.

3. I wasn't really planning on it since Paul Oosterman did such amazing work on his site. He has everything I had with more functionality and better design. [You can check it out here.](https://eve-nt.uk/designer/?fbclid=IwAR0FLWV1dNJrBuK6rEJXFHY3h6PBZo_d63yBWK1APFWEyP8Nxn-KahoPh3E)  Some of the older stuff is out of the database though, and I do think it's cool to see how everything evolved over the years. Maybe I can come back to it around the new year.

+1 for Purity of the Throne
---
Outstanding!
---
&gt; Edited to add about 7b in fitted ships (including 2 orcas) but I would rather not liquidate and I have about 65m sp
---
Extract 4m of those useless sp, this will buy a couple months of subscription - which will yield a lot of that sp back...
---
it's all the rage, means you don't really gain more skillpoints, but you  can afford the monthly sub with that 300m in your wallet. A lot of people pause like this, extract and keep their dedicated or main toons skills where they're at, extracting after each month and selling the newly trained skillpoints.

it's stackless python, how the fk you getting that on the phone m8, shit is actual spaghettis too, do u like pasta, doesn't matter it what's for dinner.

Is this still up ? What the website ?

interesting, lots of good information.  Mobile market is strong.  Eve is far from dying, positive company outlook overall.  BD is doing better then I expected.

And I guess you neanderthals don't get that it was a joke about CCP's future failed product that runs on our phones...

So I thunk that Ratting should not exist... null sec IMO should be all about raw materials which need harvesting (ABC Mining, Moon Mining, Gas Huffing, Ice and P.I) and exploration.
---
I like the idea of additional rewards been offered for “offensive actions verses pirate factions” to reward exploration (eg a buff to the Overseers Box’s) a physical item you must sell rather than instant ISK ticks!
---
Doesn't seem like there is a solution, then. Move to J space, or lowsec, or npc null, all of those have safe income sources.

I heard there are real prostitutes in Eve. Isk for a private session with a cam girl type thing. I never did see one myself.
---
I mean whenever anyone attacks anything in peoples "ratting pocket" is to drop caps/super caps sounds about as reasonable to me.

Tbh it is probably just five of you with thousands of alts

Its in Multiplayer, and thats probably a safe assumption.

I got a machariel stuck inside a sun once. Had to have a gm free it.

how would the lore explain it.   i mean consider how much the Caldari guard jita,  not to mention being the largest capsuleer hub.

Dozens of us!

Sounds like an expensive way to die
---
There is absolutely nothing wrong with what he said. For a newbie to be able to salvage 100m an hour is incredible. It was too me when I first joined Goons. 
---
But before joining a null bloc i recommend LowSec and learning to accept ship loss. Too many of my IRL friends joined Goons before learning to accept ship loss and are now severely risk adverse. Being that way limits what you are willing to do in Eve which is a disappointment. Getting SRP on a lost ship in a stratop isn't the same as taking an actual loss in a 1v1 or getting escalated on in LowSec. 
---
I think the Null blocs should require newbies join a newbro squad where you learn pvp basics in very small teams and also accept the loss of what you are flying. I think It'll really in a much better fighting force long term.
---

Someone did this a few months ago, only he started completely fresh: markestforisk.blogspot.com trading might not be your thing, but the way he does it is quite hands off, you can do other stuff while waiting for stuff to sell.
---
&gt; I would be some 16 years behind?
---
There are some things about the character skill system in Eve that are likely different than you suppose. You advance in skill points not by grinding activities in-game but by keeping your training queue updated. Skill training happens on wall-clock time whether you're logged in or not.
---
There's a huge number of skills, but all are capped at 5 levels of attainment. The number of skills that apply to *all* ships is manageably small.
---
As an exercise, after reading your post, I used an out-of-game tool (called [EveMon](https://evemondevteam.github.io/evemon/)) to create a blank character, and made a skill training plan to give that character ***perfect*** training in all of the skills that are applicable to all ships, all of the skills related to turret gunnery, the ship command skills for small (frigate) and medium (cruiser) ships of that characters race, and the weapon types most appropriate for those ships.
---
The total wall-clock time to train all of those skills for a new character (without making any of several possible efforts to speed things up) is 636 days, 19 hours, 9 minutes, and 30 seconds. That's to make a new character, flying those ships and using those weapons, every bit as effective as a pilot who has been continuously playing since 2003. In fact, because I was lazy and just hit "Plan to V" on all of them, there are some niches where this character would likely be *better* than a 16-year vet, because most people don't bother to take some of these skills to V.
---
TL;dr - you are *not* "16 years behind."
---
&gt;this may well be a game to you but to millions that play, its a career...
---
Fuck. That.
---
Also... millions? Last I heard the active playerbase was only a couple hundred thousand with less than 40k on at any one time.
---
Only if you get caught.
---
How could you have so much SP but so little isk. Do you have any alts? Do you live in null? Need questions answered
---
jesus have you ever had a unique thought all your life? you're poor attempt at redirection is at a grade school level and it's embarrassing.

I only gambled once on Eve-Bet, and out of boredom. It was time for the Super Bowl and I figured "what the Hek..."
---
So the Broncos decide to go for 2 points and that covers the spread and I end up winning big. Before that, I had only ever bet once on anything IRL and never in a video game. Have not bet since and Eve Bet is no longer a thing iirc.
---
Feel free to provide said facts, as long as they are peer-reviewed

I think this went above my head lol

well i had better idea, make npc   suicide gankers  hunting for players!!!

Do faction warfare, its fun plus making money at the same time

You aren't kidding, it's there on the source image!

Join Signal Cartel, one of the best WH explorers around.  Wealth of information by some very experienced peeps.
---
Well worth it.
---
Think about it for a few days, skillq is immensely useful - i forked a version.
---
There *is* client-side interpolation between ticks though. It would look/feel pretty sucky at 1Hz.
---
Oh I have no idea I don't go poking around in the data
---
Multiboxing. Even if maxed out eve uses 30% of resources, try to run more than 3 clients and the occasional freezing might cost you a ship.
---
I have thought about it for a week now. If anyone wants to setup their own they are more than welcome to - the code is open source.
---
When I first started playing I was able to plex my account (and then a second account) by gambling on  Esports. (Counterstrike, Starcraft, League of legends, and DOTA)  
---
It made the games a lot more exciting to watch when I had space money on the line.
---
I kind of miss it.
---
Fair, thanks for all the work you do and have done so far &lt;3
---
how bout booshing a whole fleet into the sun?
---
It was good passive isk, not great but good. Then FW LP stores got datacore, and then data sites with data cores were added. Result is that FW and explo are crashing the datacore markets.
---
In the post, it says that WHs spawn faster than we can roll them. Halfway through rolling a hole 2 more spawned. We have rolling battleships and we can't keep up.
---
IIRC there's an [SOE L3 agent](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/agent/Fynnir_Torsont) who gives a series of 3 missions that will give you such a standings boost that you can do L4s after turning in the last one. I seem to recall minimal grind to get to the point where I could do those missions, with Connections IV.
---
Some of them are moving their own stuff and have extra space in the freighter. This way they run a full load and make some money off the trip. 
---
Or they could be doing it as a way of making money that's relatively low-risk and can be done while you're working on other stuff - homework and the like.
---
1. Get an alpha alt.
---
2. Alt creates a corp and joins caldari FW and waits a couple days to be fully in.
---
3. Main joins FW corp, this starts the corp kicked out of FW after the next downtime due to standing so move quick.
---
4. Use glamourex 75.
---
5. Main runs all the L1 caldari FW missions and progresses up to L3 as fast as possible and then farm L3s using jackdaw.
---
FW missions give you State Protectorate standing and they do so really fast. Every time your State Pro standing goes up by 1 you get a FW promotion. Every time you get a FW promotion/rank for the first time, you get a significant Caldari faction standing bump (like +0.60 in standing.)
---
It takes a few hours of grinding L3s to reach 7.0 Caldari from 0.
---
I made a little bit of ISK running some local markets for a bit.
---
And also no sanctioned way to use real money to get in game gil.
---
&gt; Or is it just the collateral you get if the courier is suicided?
---
This.
---
&gt; If so how do you make a profit if you have to pay for courier contracts all the time?
---
Only pay to have stuff hauled when the sale will cover the contract plus profits.
---
Use PushX or Red Frog only when time is critical, or when cheaper methods have failed. Generally, if you want to move stuff along a trade route (between hubs say) you can still get stuff hauled for a pretty paltry reward, if your stuff is not big.
---
Put yourself in the position of a freighter pilot, who is *already* doing some trip that will be in the black but has some space in his hold. If your contract will fit, *any* reward you offer is better than flying with that space empty.
---
how do you get banned from evewho
---
but completely passive? sometimes i wish there were more incomes like that, small but passive.
---
Ehh. I've been running the same salvaged Obelisk (found it at an out of fuel POS) for years. PIRAT alone kills more freighters than gankers do.
---
I would always use their affiliate link to sub my accounts.  A whole lotta bonus gambling.

AT betting was probably the best part of the AT for me.

and take a lot more than a potato to run...

Here's hoping the new low shader models don't wreck our FPS for those of us in 24/7 potato mode.
---
I especially like the old shade model sun, what's your favorite?
---
That's a name I have not heard in a long time...
---
Ah this looks nice
---
sansha have had a pretty poor time in caldari space if the % of sansha incursions per empire is anything to go off of.
---
caldari space in general, even less luck for them, being the Caldari populace is all trained.   where it takes the gallente or amarr months to mobilize an invasion force. the caldari can do in days to weeks.  see Empyrean Age.
---
and Jita and Perimeter, being home to so many capsuleers, is probably the least likely place for an invasion to happen.  i'd sooner believe Amarr got invaded....and so far it hasn't. closest we've had is a hit and run.  emphasis on run.

Funny question from an [Initiative](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78794050/) member tbh
---
im 45days old into eve online and im having a blast in low sec.r/eve is a strange place
---
Instead of doing fuel blocks for PI do nanite repair paste. You make A LOT more ISK per m3 used, 1 paste is .01 m3 and sell for 20-25k each. So in 100 m3 that's 200m (assuming selling @ 20k each, or 250m @ 25k each)  
---
I personally use 3 accounts, 7 toons specifically for PI and making Paste. I usually pull in about 1.5-3b/week depending on how much I manage the planets. It's only like 30 minutes to move stuff from planet to customs office on all my toons, and maybe an hour from customs office to station or other offices.  
---
I also am in my own wormhole with my own customs offices so I don't have taxes, but if you find a WH with 2-5% tax on customs offices it isn't too bad.
---
I wouldn't say Eve is far from dieing. I would say pearl Abyss is doing well, but no way you can say Eve is right now.

How can you see it? All I see is it's mid-waist.

---
Yea. Sorry. Was just posting some stuff for people to look at.

Politics bullshit in a gaming sub and being hilariously wrong at that, i'd call this a retard²

I also tried really hard to be edgy when I was in 8th grade. You’ll probably grow out of it though so it’s okay
---
If exploration is what you enjoy, you might want to move to Nullsec (or just visit). Nullsec systems are mostly owned by player-run corporations and alliances (groups of corporations) and if you join one of them you'll be safer in your new home space than pretty much anywhere. Having hundreds of players ready to jump on enemies or roaming neutrals is a nice safety net. If you want to go that route, I (naturally) recommend [Dreddit](http://www.dredditisrecruiting.com), the corp I'm in. There are plenty of good newbie friendly corps though. 
---
I second the recommendation to stick to t1 exploration frigates like the [Probe](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Probe) or [Magnate](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Magnate) and docking often to save your loot in a station. Once you're more confident, an [Astero](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Astero) is the logical step up, then a CovertOps frigate like the [Anathema](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Anathema) or [Cheetah](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Cheetah) can give you a slight bonus to scanning after many days of training. The [Stratios](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Stratios) is quite expensive and the largest dedicated exploration ship. You want to look at your probe strength and virus strength when comparing these ships. 
---
If you don't already know, you can carry two (or more) sets of 8 probes in your ship. If you have more than 1 set, the launcher will automatically reload as soon as you launch, so it will be ready for use without having to manually reload in the next system. 
---
Also, if you can afford them, the Sisters Core Probes and launcher give you another slight bonus to scanning.

*Good Man.*

True. I don't multi :)
---
I did this once for a random fight in Tama last week. A SpectreFleet or something swept through and there were several dozen destroyer and battlecruiser wrecks lying around. Really easy money, even got an Intact Armor Plate off a (Taranis?) wreck. And Sunesis is best noncombat ship ever; it can pull sub-2s align, while running full hyperspats and a cargohold, and fit enough shields to resist a few smartbomb camps. Love that ship.
---
Literally unplayable
---
this is like team death match vs capture the flag. I can't stand pvp just for the sake of pvp I want objective base goals other then just killing my opponent.    
---
why would I waste time on fighting with people that I have nothing to gain from. 
---
people that fight for no other reason to fight in real life are lunatics and psychotics
---
Well, I dont think we will agree on much. Which isnt an issue in itself. But atleast we are somewhat in agreement that NS no longer has any real pull.
---
What’s the typo?
---
legacy has brought atrons and domis to fights whats your point?
---
There's plenty of room to theorycraft. Here's some ideas
---
- How you counter a fleet with lower numbers or cheaper
---
- Where you decide to stage to maximize the content you want
---
- How you make use of the local industry/market to make isk
---
- How you succesfully bait and kill an expensive ship
---
- How you smuggle something to a location without getting caught (seeding ships)
---
- How you influence people to achieve your goals (leading a group)
---
- Fitting your ships in unconventional but succesful ways
---
- Market speculation and investing
---
Most of the things listed dont have definite ways to approach them. Also the chaos era has and will change things a lot. So keep your eyes open for opportunities they give, because not all people share their discoveries.
---
You can run doom 3 tho
---
No space after “ISK.” and “This”
---
Oh. I see
---
&gt; The only problem of equipping an afterburner or micro-warpdrive is that it takes up way too much of my CPU
---
There are hardwire implants that can give you more cpu and pg.
---
Shhh!
---
OP, don't make nanite paste. Making nanite paste sucks.
---
I can neither confirm nor deny if this is what went down it got blurry after I jumped out of my Loki lol

Well... first you need to find a couple of the right people on board. Unfortunately, they're already somewhat crispy...

This.  Basically blink was open in a tab 24/7 for more than half of its life.  Alerts were easy to setup.
---
No problem was just wondering if ppl who have played fo years had it figured out already
---
Still more work than copy-pasting the WH chat code that brought us the blackout.  
---
Too bad LS FW can't be fixed that easy. :(
---
My point is that you're a fucking retard for implying they're a hunting doctrine. They're utilized to quickly hit targets everywhere because they fit through wormholes easily due to their size but that applies to literally any small ship doctrine. They are just prefered because they can stay on grid with supers.
---
Thats the wonder of eve. The ways you can fit your ships are so complex that there is no optimal.
---
That's just bots!
---
Sick burn, almost felt the need to apply lukewarm water.
---
It's the only explanation!
---
The level of burn was calibrated to the level of worthiness for a burn my man.
---
they already tried with the floating Nyx, see how that ended...
---
with they made bigger anoms with gates on them so ratting subcap fleets were a thing instead everyone fleets up in roquals and jumps their supers/fax in for defense  such is the null sec meta now.  
---
at first you have people complaining about not being able to get fights but they don't want to put in the effort or recruitment to fight blobs they just want fights with none of the hassle of owning and defending space. I bet if they started killing jump bridges and tried takeing peoples sov they would get fights. blame ccp not the nullsec players who want to build empires
---
Sure, and the gdps of systems will still be in the multiple trillions of isk
---
Well if you assume that each bot spends 8 hours a day online, then 22,000 bot bans translates to an average reduction of 22,000/3 = 7333 average users online, thus perfectly explaining the drop in player counter. If CCP banned another 66,000 bots it would reduce average players online by 22,000, perfectly explaining the PCU of 0.
---
/s
---
Yeah, but 144hz is it no benefit
---
The solution to restore numbers as evidenced this summer... Just make free daily SP for logging in a permanent feature, so our Korean overlords can remain happy.
---
You're alive!!!! \o/
---
Lol a goodie complaining about his meta getting shaken up. Harden the fuck up. Idgaf if we lose 7k risk adverse bears.
---
you would think that but people do it every day
---
Someone found out his ingame identity at some point and posted it here (some karmafleet F1 drone). After that he never posted again.
---
if you didn't steal anything run like hell the corp is a shit show. 
---
Like any corp that gets angry with you for leaving without stealing stuff isn't worth rejoining in the future anyway.
---
depends on what ships you have available, and where that 65m sp is.  t1 exploration probably isn't all that great compared to what else you can do on a 65m sp pilot, it's great for newbies but you can probably do better. Also might be worth selling one of the orcas, I haven't looked at the numbers for ice mining in a long time but I'm largely doubting it's worth it unless you want something very afk. 
---
Hateless is good, has a bunch of crazy isk making activities been doing a bunch of abyssal stuff lately, also lv4 burner missions. Has a bunch of stuff on youtube too. https://www.twitch.tv/hateless_gaming 
---
Or for super chill easy lv4 running check out  https://www.twitch.tv/tamiyacowboy
---
Probably worth grabbing a ferox and blitzing lv3s in suroken for CN standings,  and run the CN storylines  next door.  Warp speed proteus would be better but a bit over your budget.  I'd rather do that than try and run distro missions.
---
maby people don't like to pvp deathmatch style. maby they prefer object oriented pvp like fighting for space which is more meaningful
---
Pretty much. 
---
If I was a mod I'd permaban people for posting "Eve is dying" threads. No appeal, no mercy, just fuck right off back to WoW where you belong. Don't let the door hitcha where the good lord splitcha.
---
Stukas can't jump to covert cynos as the doctrine uses several non covert shiptypes....
---
HAPPY CAKE DAY CAPSULEER

they are a hunting doctrine and this whole fucking conversation is fucking retarded because who the fuck cares
---
Google "pyfa"
---
it's completely passive and exceptionally small. If it takes me an hour to collect that, in that same hour I could have been rorq mining or running ishtars or even looting field in pvp to get as much money. R&amp;D is not a money making, at best it's a convenience if you're doing invention.
---
Ah yes, Ironbank, known goon.
---
You can use https://capsuleer.app instead.
---
Oh, hey! I wasn't expecting you to actually respond to me!
---
&gt; He has everything I had with more functionality and better design. You can check it out here.
---
Yeah, I know about that site, but it doesn't show some of the old ships that were removed from the database like the Erinye, Clotho, Blade, and the like.
---
&gt; What did you like about my site?
---
I liked it because it allowed me to see the history of EvE's ships and modules, how the game evolved over the years and what CCP tried and discarded. It also serves as an excellent resource - along with Chribba's typeID list and several other sources - for what is steadily becoming an *essay* on EvE's typeIDs, what they mean, and what the story behind them is.
---
I'm particularly fascinated by how the Angel Cartel ships have evolved throughout the years since they've apparently been in the game since the very beginning and had their names changed since then. The "Tyrant" entry in [your old site](https://web.archive.org/web/20171222081749/http://gogela.com/eve/index-rem.php) that had no typeID and a Nightmare's portrait? Turns out that was the original name for the Machariel-class battleship, though I had to do some digging before I found that out: [News Article](https://www.eveonline.com/article/ushrakhan-under-assault-from-new-foe), [old NPC list](https://oldforums.eveonline.com/?a=topic&amp;threadID=70505).
---
All things considered, amazing as EvE-NT is I prefer to use it to look at ships and turrets in a 3d environment and not much more than that. Your site was a *better* resource for my historical research since it showed most/all of the old ships along with their typeIDs, and I'd love to see it again if you ever choose to recreate it!
---
Hi I'm new here. Explain the data cores thing?  Is that something you buy with LP? So gives you the best LP -&gt; ISK conversion when selling to Jita ?
---
Yeah I imagine this will really hurt people who are doing multiboxxing + low-end hardware. I don't quite have this problem anymore since I bought an actual gaming rig - but previously I would try to run 3-5 accounts on my shitty laptop to play and it barely held together.
---
With 64bit + changes like this, low-end hardware will be way more limited.
---
Yeah, noticed that a while back. Nice bit of detail
---
if you are going to compare anything to multiboxing Rorqual 0.0 mining, everything will be unworthy of a players time, but whatever.
---
&gt; I’ve seen a lot of wormholes, but I haven’t gone to any of them because I have no idea of what use they are to me. 
---
[Read this](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Wormhole#Wormhole_Identification). (In fact, bookmark [this](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main_Page).)
---
What you want are wormholes that lead directly to null sec space. That is where you will find the best relic and data sites. After you arrive in null, make note of where you are and have a look at the relevant [region map](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/), looking at the options that show activity in the various systems. You'd like to find a loop or cluster of systems with low traffic to explore in, one with enough systems to keep you occupied for 2-3 hours at a time. After you've run the sites in your chunk of space you do a safe logoff in space until the next day, whereupon you repeat the process. 
---
While you are doing the sites you want to be paying attention to [dscan](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/DScan) (note especially [this section](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/DScan#Defensive_Scanning)) to avoid being unpleasantly surprised by visitors dropping by to see how your efforts are going.
---
When you have an unimaginably valuable heap of loot, or a few hundred mil worth anyway, start scanning wormholes again looking for one to high sec. Pop through that and see how far you are from Jita, and either fly there to unload your loot or duck back into the hole you just came out of and find one that comes out closer to where you want to be.

#Goon4life
---
Just ignore that old goon insecurity. Play the game *you* want to play it.
---
Not your fault. Just an archaic and unorthodox way for a company to report its financials in most people’s opinion.
---
Data cores are used for invention, which consumes a T1 BPC, some data cores, optionally an "accelerator", and produces a T2 BPC. Data cores can be acquired from R&amp;D agents (mission agents who can also do research, then you exchange isk+research points for cores), faction warfare, and exploration. So there are a number of sources for these data cores which really limits the price, and it's only used for invention of which only so much is really necessary.
---
So they're not worth a lot of money, and is why R&amp;D is a bad mechanism to make money / source data cores outside of the fact that it's completely passive.
---
That would be interesting, diamond catalysts and thrashers hunting down freighter that get concorded
---
Just because they happen to be the best tool for the job in the current meta doesn't mean that is the purpose they were made for. Or would you say booshravens were a hunting doctrine if INIT. started dunking rorqs with them all over the place?  
---
&gt;this whole fucking conversation is fucking retarded because who the fuck cares  
---
That sentence describes this whole sub tbh vOv
---
"WHERE IS UR DATA THAT PEOPLE ARE LEAVING"
---
&lt;every wormholer ever&gt;
---
I mean if people arent allowed to speak about a problem it doesnt exist right?
---
If you ban everyone so eve shuts down or make them quit to get there
---
Then eve wont be dying anymore
---
Brilliant!
---
This is intended :)
---
- CCP
---
you do know there are hundreds of bots running concurrently in highsec alone right now, right?
---
Then i'm happy i'm at least worthy enough for a reply in under a minute lmao
---
At least in my opinion, the RnK Clarion Call videos are the best ever made. 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20F3n6wHsbA
---
Have you heard of this thing called "money" that CCP needs to run the game?
---
don't get too wound up, we all remember what happened the last time an antiganker lost his cool
---
That's not a \`fun roam\` then. If people want to go for a fun roam then they should just go out and do it. If people want to do home defense they should just go out and do it. Relying on your small group's few decent FCs for fucking roaming is rediculous, especially when \`FCing a roam\` just means posting a desto and letting people know what kinda ships you wanna fly.
---
For april fools incursions in hisec and concord instantly kills anyone with red safety because itd be funny to play a prank on people who think they have all the cards held :)
---
Or the more boring, less upside, rescuing abandoned T2 drones of mission runners with combat probes.
---
The drones will thank you, that's all that matters.
---
We don't want the "it's dying" doom n gloomers over at world of warcraft either.
---
Post saved.
---
"Risk averse" says an unspoken. The irony
---
Not really. Most of a planet's income is taxes to the corporations who own the sovereignty. Since the empire corporations dont actually pay taxes to concord via sov structures one can infer the empires dont pay any taxes to concord and therefore are the main cause of why concord is underfunded.
---
My guess is it's not gonna be a damavik 
---
Poiiiiiii
---
Empires don't pay taxes to Concord. They directly fund Concord.
---
Then who will you undock to fight? We all know you guys run away as soon as something unlocks which might kill you.
---
no offense to the co2 members but they'd never be an alliance without gigx
---
there are certain alliance (and even corps) that are built around "cult" personalities, and gigx was one such personality. 
---
I cannot judge (heh) his leadership skills since I was never in co2 but imo,  gigx was the one attracting people to the alliance
---
I seriously doubt that "most fights (are) artificial" ... I've been playing since 2007/8; other than sov/entosis fights where you literally have a timer that both sides are aware of, I've never participated in a fight that felt even close to staged. Obv with entosis timers, both sides know when and where there *may* be a fight, but even then- that's just a game mechanic to attempt to produce content. Yeah maybe your opponents are just troll toasting to get a fight out of you- but it's your choice to defend your sov or not. Even in FW lowsec where there are literally separate plexes to fight in/ I-Hubs to fight over, battles and skirmishes never felt pre-arranged. I'm sure it's possible, and I may just be naive enough to not be aware that I did, in fact, participate in a prearranged brawl- but it has certainly **never** felt that way to me.
---
Get rid of the overview already more chaos less bots
---
This is a near impossible question to answer. Like it fundamentally cannot be answered unless you provide a lot more parameters.
---
Seem to be destroyed by sansha npcs i guess
---
sad times
---
Now that i think about it....your right. :(
---
They havent catered to whales though with the blackout. Blackout caters to pvpers more than anything. Cyno changes will just be cancer.
---
I don't mind if something that might kill me unlocks tbh. Actually helps out quite a bit.
---
Yeah it sucks, especially considering I already have to restart the EVE client like every 30-60 minutes of gameplay depending on how many session changes I make, because for some reason something is triggering the EVE client and causing it to drop FPS and remain locked at 30 (and it's super sluggish) until I restart and get my 60fps back.
---
Oh look, it's the daily PCU thread
---
This is huge.
---
that isnt right...  
---
Main Problem was the Ban of gigX.  
---
Co2 isnt Co2 without gigX.  
---
And the second point ist that if you reform - goons will just deploy and play the bully card.  
---
So its fine. We are talking on the Co2 Discord servber and play together in Horde. :P
---
shaders what eve online need more than balancing game mechanics
---
&gt; Idgaf if we lose 7k risk adverse bears.
---
You say you don't give a fuck, but you do.
---
like flincher14 said, there's just no optimal way to fit anything, you can only fit something so-so for certain conditions and then it'll still suck for other conditions. In a rare instance you can make something reeeaaallly good at one thing, like in pipebombing fits, but for the most part you just fit a nice all-rounder for certain common conditions and avoid fighting in other conditions where your fit and ship won't do well (though if you fly t1 ships they're so cheap if you live in null now, that you may as well just go balls deep every time and just reship when you get podded, it'll be more interesting than fleeing).
---
It was all about gigx.
---
Eve miss that crazy sociopath
---
Still waiting for tiericide. I hope it'll happen soon.
---
You could just make 50 t1 amarr frigates and destroyers and fit them with the cheap meta modules (or even t1 since you can make 50 in a short time for nearly no cost), then go have fun. Once in a while you'll get someone with a shiny ship who made a mistake, or find a hauler with 500M in it. min/maxing is no fun.
---
uh... no?
---
Those wormholes are exactly what you want. You have to be careful -- it's a free-for-all out there, and there are many considerations for staying safe. But if you're a new explorer, doing a single pirate relic/data site in there will likely replace your whole ship and fit several times over! You want class 1, 2, and 3 wormholes (which are the ones with connections back to regular k-space). Don't do it too close to population centers, and watch for anyone trying to hunt you. If you need a more detailed guide on staying safe, from the perspective of a Wormholer who hunts other explorers when he gets the chance, just let me know.
---
You should check out EvE: Valkyrie
---
Pattern matching, my dear?
---
Humans are able to make out patterns from incomplete visuals. You don’t see the whole thing but you see part of the thing.
---
The style and color scheme are clearly Amarr. The shape is not of any of the classic capital ships although it’s a large space frame. It has some aspects of the other FAX machines, it seemed like a not-too-difficult educated guess.
---
At first I was thinking "yeah, frozen pizza? So what?"
---
But it is clearly something much worse.
---
Figure it out yourself you lazy turd
---
swing and a missssss
---
If I was a mod I'd ban anyone with a cloaked or wormholer flair. No appeal, no mercy, just fuck right off back to woe where you belong. Don't let the door hitcha where the good lord splitcha.
---
Does there need to be a reason? This is Japan.
---
We have a sort of unofficial blue standing with them... we don't tell any members they *can't* shoot at Signal Cartel, but everyone sort of agrees to leave them alone anyway. They're cool.
---
"best" and "last" are questionable, maybe. But It does suck to see an alliance that at least made an attempt to be independent just fold in to goons.
---
It is also a little ironic to see that coming from snuff, who did basically the same thing.
---
Meh
---
Wait can you use /me? I've been using /emote this entire time..
---
Y amarr frigs tho? Any particular reason?
---
can confirm that :(
---
EVE Thing was a massive, great tool for that too.
---
Thank you Squizz!
---
i like the sub, i still hop on some old corps teamspeaks, I love the game too. But i was a fan of old school sov and stuff. I am here yearning for the old days (CCP POCO SOV when?). The things like infinite resources (havens, sanctums, belts) took away that constant fighting for room / resources. If somehow that came back, I would resub immediately.
---
lazors pewpew
---
My argument is nullsec was making way to much money compared to the actual game content it represented. You can play in any way you want I don’t care. Not sure what my killboard has to do with all this but sure you can have a look: https://zkillboard.com/character/95538917/
---
Talk for yourself
---
Another alternative: https://spaceships.app
---
lol there are lvl 2,3,4 and 5 .......
---
Is it possible to setup a home in Wormhole space that has a very low mass restriction?  I really enjoyed frig/destroyer/cruiser combat and was wondering if it's ever been done before.   I haven't played in a very long time and I'm basically a noob at this point.  (Probably always was)
---
Not even a little bit my dude. I gladly take fights where I’m not going to win outright unless I pilot my fucking heart out. There’s more to this game than just anchoring on an FC and pressing buttons. You should learn about it. Cause it’s a shit ton of fun.
---
big killmail sun final and top damage
---
Normal mission agents will never stop giving missions and just cycle through a list of pregenerated ones. If you meet certain conditions, like lose enough standings with the agent/corporation/faction by failing missions (this is hard to do), they won't give you any more, but as long as you remain in good standing you will always be able to receive more.
---
OT, but WTF is up with [this guy](https://zkillboard.com/character/2114647575/)?
---
If only the app could run on my android..
---
C'mon what is the minimum requeriment? I have a phone that costed me more than my country's minimum wage. More than my income. (At the time)
---
That guy has never lost a loki.  How unfortunate.
---
To also add you might have to travel to a different station/system to find a different level agent.
---
Has he really not?
---
They were always goon pets. Now it’s official
---
So how do I make it stop giving them to me? Do I just decline them?
---
“best”, “last”, “independent” are you high ? Iron Armada has been complete trash since forever. I’m surprised goons are taking inactive corps though I thought that they had relatively high actual membership requirements.
---
Read [https://ashyin.space/category/how-2-krab/](https://ashyin.space/category/how-2-krab/)
---
I'm not sure you can run C3 anoms in a vaga, as they can put out a good amount of webs/dps. Given the Vaga's anemic number of mids, I would highly recommend keeping the relic analyzer and cargo scanner in your hold and using a mobile depot to swap them out.
---
But you're probably better off just running C3 anoms in a Rattle or running relic sites in an astero/strat/Covops frig instead of trying to do both at once.
---
That's just a fact, though. We're talking about things that everyone knows.
---
In case you're that socially inept and not just trolling, you got downvoted because of the tone of your post.
---
The only change here is the alliance ticker for iron guard. Virtually everything else will be the same.
---
But would that not drop standings and all that stuff?
---
No you can refuse a mission once every 4 hours per agent without any penalties.
---
Oh ok then. Thanks
---
Meh.
---
The game used to have peaks of 10-15k at most during its first 2-4 years and that's the years where they did most of the development for the ship classes we now have in the game.
---
Source: I started playing when the biggest ship was a battleship and the only t2 class available was interceptors, 2 years later when i stopped playing there were titans in the game. I regularly remember peaks of not more than 12k people on weekends during that time.
---
In other words, 10k online players (which translates to roughly the same number of paying accounts since there were no alpha clones back then, give or take some als/multiboxing of course) was enough to fund a sizeable dev team (salaries and what not) and still make profit for the company.
---
bye
---
You are not ‘independent’ you are the borderland meatshield of the Panfam Coalition. You have been put into shitty space with lots of wormhole connections - demand better space then. Also you are not just being harassed by wormholers we have been making occasional trips with 2-4 guys because we know we might get a chance to kill something and have a skirmish before you bring a Munnin fleet to drive us off. You have 700 alts in a PvP alliance so you should easily have numbers to defend (unless your numbers are vastly inflated by inactive) and I would have assumed having PvP delivered to your doorstep would be a great recruitment driver and help keep PvP players in the alliance, otherwise they will just leave of boredom if they are surrounded by blues.
---
And eve bet, too. I got my first millions betting on football, helped launch my JF operations that I have made billions from since.
---
This is what people want tho.  
---
They wouldn’t scream chaos if they didn’t want people to seek safety
---
&gt; It is also a little ironic to see that coming from snuff, who did basically the same thing.
---
Yeah snuff was pretty quick to get on their knees.
---
You can get a DST or Orca in, which can drop an Astrahus. You can build a Fortizar in the hole and a ship that can drop it, and use that to build dreads and faxes that can never leave the hole.
---
Frigate only holes iirc are only shattered, which you can’t really live in anyway.
---
yeah... a $2000 3d model.
---
despite the absurd price tag. a surprising number sold....even if it never delivered.
---
now. lets skip the insane price tag. and special jumble. and make it simple.
---
a 3d print.  cost $50-100.   easy to make, like the old rifter model but without usb and electronics.
---
people would buy.  
---
heck, theres model kits out there....unofficial, of EVE ship models designed to play Battlefleet Gothic.    yeah, theres interest.
---
ffs.  GW, as greedy and overpriced as they are,  would gladly sell it if CCP let them.
---
Just stop asking for a new one and move on to another agent or something else entirely.
---
Damn... Cant they make better textures for our ships... I mean... That is ugly as fuck (blurry textures, not ship)
---
The more you know!
---
Shouldn't you? It's not less targets that'll fight you ingame, but it is less money in CCP's wallet for mobile app development.
---
Kek.
---
Underrated post
---
Would it be difficult for a new player to get settled in Wormhole space?  Could I realistically find an open system to setup in and call home?
---
Not compatible with the Razer. :(
---
lmao what, we were among those who started world war bee and then leadership knew titans were the future, we had to farm our armada and it's no secret we aren't the biggest fans of panfam and do a lot of stuff with INIT it was the perfect option. 
---
After that we left the imperium and have been farming goons in delve for almost a year now, jesus whats wrong with you people
---
Quick and easy solo player ISK: Base out of highsec. Fit up a cheap explorer and a PvE ship designed to fight whichever pirate faction spawns in the space you're basing out of. A T1 exploration frigate with T1 probes with level 3 exploration skills is fully capable of scanning and hacking any sites you care about. Better skills and better equipment just speeds up the process, but does increase the risk since your ship is now worth more. I don't even bother fitting a cloak; it's not worth the cost.
---
Scan around your highsec home system and its neighbours. Look for wormholes and combat sites. Run any DED sites first, then any unrated combat sites that have a reasonable chance to drop faction loot or escalate to worthwhile escalations. An assault frigate is a cheap, easy way to run any highsec combat site, the Enyo being my personal favourite. If you want to be more efficient, go with a Gila.
---
Once you've cleared all the combat sites and dropped off your loot, pop into the ("unknown," not "dangerous unknown" or "deadly unknown") wormholes. Scan every site in each hole, bookmark every wormhole and make note of where it leads, then start hacking any hackable sites. If you collect more than say 20mil, pop out of the hole, drop off your loot, then go back in. Repeat, travelling down the chain until you reach a system with active players who would hunt you or you find the end of the chain. You'll easily make billions with practically no effort. With the time I have available to play, it takes me a month of daily L4 mission running to make less than what I can make in just a few hours of this.
---
It's frustrating for beginners, but it can be *really* hard to fit a destroyer with a full rack of weapons until you get your fitting skills up, and missile launchers have higher CPU requirements than all but the largest turrets of comparable size. LML frigates and destroyers are some of the harder ships to fit because of this, even though the hulls have more CPU than turret hulls.
---
Use a processor overclocking rig or a CPU upgrade, and fit a prop mod. And train CPU Management and Weapons Upgrades until you don't need it anymore.
---
Most people who fight semi-symmetric or asymmetrical fights don’t anchor.
---
I thought the narrative was bots are a problem because they are printing isk 23/7??
---
Someone actually pointed out - FF14.
---
I just don't think this is true...
---
I guess we’re thankful that people who deny reality aren’t mods.
---
Lol
---
My faxes look so fat in hangar I feel sorry for how fat they look, like they're so fat they cant get back out again.
---
Like where?  See /u/joeswindell and /u/ravstar52's posts.
---
I mean... I'm gonna need some examples here, because this just doesn't seem correct.
---
Ff14 has Gold saucer but no way to buy gill afaik
---
That's the joke, Hilmar and falcon and the reddit downvote brigade keep claiming that losing thousands of players in a few months is just the bots getting banned, they are ignoring the fact that the bots just moved to highsec and started running courier missions and mining in battleships because admitting all they did was drive thousands of actual paying real players out of the game would make them look stupid.
---
Sig tanking
---
Well, dislike it all you want, if CCP thinks it has to go, it will go. In fact, the longer people cling on to their safety, the more likely it is CCP will yank it right out from under their feet like a carpet, because it makes the game stale and bloats the economy.
---
I hope it will go, because frankly the current nullsec meta seems like a bunch of big softies playing pretend enemies for the most part. I have old characters with good, specialized skillsets i could easily get into any of the big blocs, but i don't even see the point. And one of the main reasons for that is that there is no consequence and no real risk anymore in null. Between the hand-holding game mechanics and the players having figured everything out and consolidating to such a high degree, it's just boring.
---
Considering ships within the same class have more or less the same signature, and if you're fitting them for max DPS and no tank (ie. no shield extenders to increase sig), then the highest damage lowest signature ship in each class would be the highest damage ship in each class.     
---
Anecdotally, I'd say     
---
Frigates: assault frigates / triglavian     
---
Destroyers: tactical destroyers / triglavian     
---
Cruiser: HACs / triglavian     
---
Battlecruiser: attack battlecruisers / triglavian     
---
Battleship: pirate battleships / triglavian     
---
there will be exceptions of course
---
Pretty legit
---
How about the next 7k we lose? Or the 7k after that? The player count is falling off a cliff and Hilmar and Falcon just keep pushing, how low do you think the player count can get before you can't anyone to shoot and call content?
---
Now that i think about it this was a poorly thought out question
---
Soli, is that you?
---
So you feel its a good thing the game is making its way back to launch numbers at a steadily increasing rate?
---
&gt; They stop being doom and gloomy in WoW because classic is growing at an insane rate,
---
as a regular i can assure you that it definitely has not even slowed down the doom n glooming. It's just not as audible over the reeing of the classic crowd.
---
In a bigger cluster, no less
---
Idk man, reading the comments here im starting to believe like 90% of the people posting in this thread think stukas were normal hotdrop bombers....
---
&lt;everyone tired of WHer BS&gt; points at eve player count graph showing the numbers falling off a cliff  
---
&lt;WHers&gt; those doesn't matter because hilmar (the guy most motivated to BS) said the opposite without providing any numbers at all.
---
This is the update we have all been waiting for.
---
Who wants to start taking bets that in the final two weeks of the window for hilmar to earn his EVE sale bonus we see a log in campaign AND an in game skill points event be released that runs right up to the last day?
---
&gt; this may well be a game to you but to millions that play, its a career...
---
Yeah, get the fuck out of there. Ew.
---
They haven't been indepent for at least 2 years now what are you even talking about?
---
Better April fools day joke, have every ns gate dump you in a random wh. Or better. Have all regional gates from ns not work or send you through a random other regional gate.
---
If your going for some fun, Mebbe include the ns kids on the fun.

He'll drop a whole rorq fleet on your ass.
---
Then you're a no-lifer nerd, who'll either shoot up a mall or stalk him in game.
---
One of those dead-end lowsec pockets nobody ever goes to.
---
I just wish there was a web alternative for EVEMon so I can calculate how much SP I'll get if I switch implants, and what's the best training plan for my current queue. I wish SkillQ did that.
---
Iirc I think once you reach a 10.0 standing with that particular agent they will not give any more missions.
---
I'd like to agree. Yeah it's true eve went through good years with low pop. But this and that aren't apples to apples. It's a different playerbase, a different decade, a shrinking pop instead of a growing one, a day and age where we already have all the things you mention as being developed during the low pops but when ccp no longer had the employees who were behind the stuff that led to 60k PCUs a few years later, etc.
---
free mid slots for tackle, decent damage application, look rather nice on high graphics, the kitey-shit will outrun you no matter what because they have t2/faction/deadspace mods, so might as well have a brick since you'll be slow.
---
Seems too obvious. I bet on the last 2 months instead of the last 2 weeks.
---
I explore with a Cheetah fit with combats, if I see drones with not ships on Dscan I scan down the drones and scoop them

*citation needed*

Fuck you. I want more people in ustz to shoot.

Just delete drones, nothing of value will be lost.

RE: /u/joeswindell's comment:

RE: FFXIV _I'm not entirely sure_, I'd need to know more about the specifics.

The main countries at play here would be the Netherlands and Belgium.
---
But note that gambling enforcement in Europe is generally up to the respective overseeing organisation. What is and isn't gambling (read: what does and doesn't need a license) has no strictly defined rules.
---
E.g.: Lootboxes are gambling, mechanically-identical MtG/YuGiOh/whatever trading card packs are not, on grounds that the former has evidence of significant harm (gambling addiction, financial ruin, etc) and the latter does not.
---
Stop blueing all of ustz then? Plenty of people to shoot
---
That's pretty neat.
---
The point is they are increasing scarcity of resources with the recent changes. They realize that the overabundance they created with all of the buffs to nullsec the past 5 years have unbalanced the economy.

Have you thought about T3D? A Hecate with no mods has a 1 second align time and holds like 600m3 IIRC. I'm sure the other ones are even better. And they're not that expensive.

Fight club? Sanction and controlled fights or just the usually "show up and hope for a fight"?

Market trading is anything but passive IMO.
---
lmao flash. what fucking year is it? who the fuck thought that would be a good idea for an official tech company release ityool 2019?
---
Logging just a couple times a year on an alpha account and going exploring for a few hours would have higher yields than this, and be more exciting. This is not at all a moneymaker especially given you need to time sink to the point that you can use enough L4 research agents.

See you on the next sov fleet, pet-fam!

If only every single Isk gambling site hadn't been a voracious RMT scheme huh?

Am I supposed to get annoyed at that?    You are dumb.
---
Definitely still worth it!  You can pretty quickly train into ships that will make other ships blow up.  Lots of fun to be had.  just might lose some ships along the way :)

Fair enough. I meant more in the "literally never work or speak with anyone" sense.
---
Big decision. Will I be attending this party?
---
What is going on with the Galente/Caldari war?  Seems like Caldari has captured almost all the systems.  Are they just more active / better or is there some meta-gaming going on here where there are advantages to being behind that I am missing
---
The period of time they said when the sale was originally announced was a year, and it sold in October, so we would already be in the event if they were going to do the last 2 months.

Yeah, you saying /emote does the same thing as /me?

How much liquid isk do you have to invest, how many alts do you have and how much sp do you have?

If you’re new, while you could technically settle in a wormhole, it probably wouldn’t be a smart idea. Look at joining a new player friendly wormhole group instead.

Other ships cameras zoom out. No one bothered fixing the FAX's.
---
Just make a market alt, get into a imperium or legacy or panfam  corp and use there in house logistics team to move shit from jita wherever they stage. You only need like 1.5b - 4b to start and you can make bank. So many items well above 25% of jita people just want shit immediately and don't give a fuck how much they pay. You can easily hit 20-30b in a month or 2 off of a few billion.

Huh. So now all the former VAF peeps are goons. Eve politics are weird sometimes.
---
inb4 "ree 2bil per jump ccp hates capitals"
---
I am wholly prepared to have the developer in charge be served Surströmming for three weeks straight.
---
&lt;*gasp*&gt; Why reward them?
---
yes
---
&gt;and the option to immediately start with them plus a button to enter full char creation if wanted.
---
Not a bad idea actually. 
---
Though, if I were CCP, I'd want to do A/B testing there: 
---
* one third get dumped directly into space,
---
* one third get to choose like you've suggested,
---
* one third keep using the current system. 
---
Then see which(if any) have notably better retention.
---
i feel like i am being trolled
---
So you were in goons, and you still get titans from goons, but independent btw.
---
sure is an option. but i like to keep it cheap and as low sig as possible. also a bit slow on grid. half of the fun comes from going balls deep with people still fighting on grid. also can´t enter novice plexes and not viable for alphas (which is all i do this with tbh to get that first plex and a alpha injectors to speed this up). on the other hand you can pretty much be completely combat capable so it might be a good thing if you want the best of both worlds or to bully people away from your precious booty.
---
They went out of their way to create a lore based excuse for no local out of thin air so it seems clear CCP thinks lore is essential.
---
we still get our titans from goons? oh that is great to hear, I will let leadership know we can get cheap delve titans again, thank you sir
---
I was in CO2, and experienced the betrayal first-hand.
---
I never should have listened to the 'move' edict, and moved nearly all my assets into the keepstar, along with everyone else.  But I did.
---
I was also in the respin of CO2, that ended in Fade.  Though it was nice to hear gigX's gruffness again in fleets, it wasn't the same without all the other people that made the fleets a great experience.
---
Example:  I'm a hardcore industrialist, and at one point I hit #2 for PvP activity in my corp (monthly ISK reward), a regularly top 5(?) alliance PvP corp, during my time in Impass.  It wasn't gigX that inspired me, either.
---
Yes, they made the lore around the change. Which is exactly what I said. Lore is still good fun and adds a layer of depth, but you're not designing the game around it. It's the other way around.
---
I've lost ~200m exploring. I've made billions. If you're learning, you're risking a &lt;10m ship, where a can can be 40m+. I've found wormholes that I cleared and made 400m+ from 14 sites.
---
Or you can go hours without finding much. But its fun.
---
Gambling in games is fun as long as you aren't paying real money to get in game currency to gamble. That's why the new casino in GTAV is banned in several countries and with you being able to buy plex with real money and then sell the plex, you're essentially buying isk thus using real money in an online casino. It's different for FF games because you're not buying in game money with rl money.
---
Its just a normal nullsec area with smaller groups, so you probably won't get 90 titans dropped on your t1 frigate. You can also join one of them, they do regular fights (with POS warfare as far as I'm aware).
---
sorry I agree with your fun roam I was referring to the last part about  his alliance as a whole isn't that fond of PVP.  I meant maby they just don't think of roams as being fun and only like to pvp when it has meaning.
---
&gt;Marauder MJD While Bastion + Able to light Cyno. (Cyno would prevent MJD while Bastion)
---
Why?
---
&gt;+ current proposals in regard to recon cyno, only if recon ship attributes adjust, bit more tank/cargo, 90% reduction in cyno duration (1 minute)
---
Reduced duration is probably one of the first "knobs" they will turn regarding iteration on the announced cyno changes. It makes the most sense, and is easiest to do.
---
&gt;Scratch the Blackops ship cyno, it already got its function in current meta
---
They bridge stukas. That's 90% of their "role." Even if you think that counts, there hasn't been a good use case presented for blops to be in cynos over recons in any scenario. They'll probably rarely use this feature except maybe on bait DED Widows?
---
&gt;JF's should be able to jump to covert cyno though, supply behind enemy lines. get more conflict.
---
No, a million times. There's not a single reason that a JF should be able to use a covert ops cyno outside of "waaah logistics is hard." Ships that fit covert cloaks use covert cynos, that's the whole thing. It was a meme work around that made it laughably safe to move JFs and was a mistake in the first place.
---
No idea what your goal is. You may want to combine small sig with good speed. Obviously small sig means MWDs are not an option. So look for ships that can fit over-sized afterburners. That way you can combine small sig with speed-tanking. But you will have to use weapons which don't suffer from your own speed. I.e. you need guns with high tracking speed or missiles.
---
What....?
---
&gt; And Sunesis is best noncombat ship ever; it can pull sub-2s align, while running full hyperspats and a cargohold, and fit enough shields to resist a few smartbomb camps. Essentially a T1 blockade runner. Love that ship.
---
yepp, and for alphas in their first weeks it´s actually somewhat viable to PvP in and make it at least somewhat competible. it´s nothing to write home about but if you get bored with making money you can just fit one up and try to produce a few wrecks yourself (honestly ends in you becoming the wreck most of the time since your support skills just aren´t there yet but it´s fun none the less).
---
Also also the casino uses a currency only exclusive to it. Sure you can buy rewards, but they are all cosmetic.
---
Thanks for info
---
Then why when I come around solo, you decide to run and hide?
---
I gave up on boring null rating and just run abysals and explore. May not always be lucrative but sometimes you hit payday.
---
Can you fill out the form where you can directly quote the official lore with page number, chapter, and verse please? Dont bother posting fan fiction either. Otherwise, you need to let my logic go.
---
Only if the sell back to the alliance at a 30% loss.
---
Agreed, a 25% drop.....
---
This is fail Cascade territory.
---
Referencing WoW
---
Having an in game system for gambling would be kinda cool tbh. Bet on stuff like abyssal pvp or what have you
---
And that he did!
---
Not sure I’d call it a reward. It’s a Swedish ‘delicacy’, not an Icelandic one.
---
Though, now that I think of it, I’m not sure a people that eats fermented shark would be squeamish about pickled herring.
---
*See, you had it in you all along.*
---
TBF you should upgrade the Voodoo 2 is a far stronger card and can be had at a good price these days
---
I'd like the idea of Marauders being able to move away from whats swarming around them.
---
We might see other meta appear, marauders that are still stuck in their cycle, possibly long range fit. acting like the gateguns we see in highsec. (deploy a few that properly trained themselves for good positioning on grid)
---
They are made to tank by themselves, fax can't or any subcap logi wont be able to rescue it, making the cyno become a priority-target. a little bit like a cyno inhib currently also is a prio-target.
---
i think i actually proposed this idea before, maybe also something along the lines of MJD jump range reduced by 50% when in bastion.
---
Now with this Cyno change i just wanted to re-ignite the idea and see what people think. Cyno on the Marauder wouldn't be a bad idea, atleast its better than placing it on the Blops, if you had to pick 1 of the 2 T2 Battleships.
---
imagine how more spreadout capitals would be if multiple marauders would cyno up.
---
Maybe went to deep into other ideas regarding upcoming cyno changes and JF's, its a wild topic in the community
---
In a way the JF could also use a cov cloak, but not as of now with current tether mechanics on the citadels.
---
Or come up with a different jumpfreighter like there are also DST and Blockade Runners.
---
Going far offtopic now though, just kinda disliked the Logistics Cyno announcement making me elaborate further past the marauder idea.
---
Kill em with kindness
---
Put your make and model number in the reddit thread, as well as the version of os.  Be useful instead of whining.
---
42 doesn't seem a lot compared to 30 sig.
---
But that's actually 40%!
---
Wow. Ref one Fort and kill a whole alliance by that. didn't see that coming
---
I’m looking forward ti the cyno changes.  Fuck super umbrellas. (Though I’d like a capital rebalance.)
---
Very funny post my guy
---
Go Bucky!
---
Eve hasnt been for the little guy for 5 years
---
What happend to garmon?
---
at least I'm battin' 1000 on ur mom AYYYY
---
Genuine question, do you use any of these ships? Your perceived meta of how it will play out with your ideas is pretty far off from how it would likely work.
---
Marauders *already* can move away from what's swarming them, that's why they have the MJD bonus. Allowing them to mjd while bastioned quite literally defeats the purpose of being able to mjd out *or* tank up and sit there.
---
No one is going to use a marauder as a "gategun" because they're terrible cost ineffective and gate camps are already better than that would be. Neither marauder or blops will be used as a cyno ship over a recon because there's not a reason to.
---
Those changes would likely involve ratters using them as they can fit a defensive cyno still, and potentially survive on grid long enough to be saved. 
---
JF can't and should not be able to use a covops cloak. They're for logistics. If you want to supply "behind enemy lines" you can use a Blockade Runner, that's their actual purpose. It's broken as fuck if you let JFs use covops cynos, and if you don't know why you likely don't use them or are trying to not admit it's broken, because it will make your life easier.
---
My guess is you like the idea of Marauders but they're kinda shit so you want a use for them
---
Cut out the middleman and sell pvp loot.
---
The one here I burn out everything :( hope you guys enjoy regardless :)
---
Tbh I wouldn't. Astero and Stratios are nice, shiny, easy kills without cloaks
---
If it means a healthier, more attractive game ecosystem in the long run i don't mind some temporary drops at all, especially since history tells us that the game can stay afloat with 10k players.
---
PCU is so hotly debated because it's the only metric visible to players, but it's also very misleading. I came back to the game after more than a decade and regularly roamed null in NPSI fleets before the blackout, it was empty as hell. I distinctly remember a 4 hour roam where all we would find was a semi-AFK VNI every 5-10 jumps. In the single case where people formed something up, they brought ships that guaranteed there would not be a fight: 2 titans and a few HAW dreads with FAX support against a kitchen sink frig/dessie fleet. They could have brought a kitchen sink cruiser fleet of their own and have some fun in cheap ships, but they decided it was better for them to jump in stuff that we couldn't kill, but that couldn't catch us either. Let's face it, that's just plain boring and it has as much of an adverse effect on the much praised PCU numbers as anything.
---
Contrast this with the early days. I also roamed null back then and despite the lower PCU there was no shortage of people to shoot even on weekdays. Instant travel was not as much of a thing, so people had to actually be out in space and patrol their routes if they wanted to do supply runs and guard their space. Which meant that even if you found nothing else, you could always count on finding a gatecamp in one of the usual nullsec entrysystems/chokepoints to try and bust it up.
---
Long story short, PCU doesn't mean much if a sizable portion of those players are AFK in a citadel waiting for pings while they play another game. What generates content and lessens boredom is the amount of people out in dangerous space willing to shoot and get shot.
---
Instead, what we get now is hyper-consolidation in null, to the point where some of the biggest groups in the game have to resort to making a big event out of ganking haulers in hisec to get their pilots a fix of pvp. It would be sad if it wasn't so ridiculous and funny.
---
I made billions off the Holly Holms vs Ronda Rousey fight. Was set for over a year in eve. Really miss sport betting.
---
quick napkin math that's -7,300 Omegas that translates into \~$147,250 USD loss this month assuming they dropped Omega status... that's like 1.7 devs - remember that.
---
no bears = no easy kills = no content for you
---
&gt;*Who wants to start taking bets*
---
I see what you did there
---
Just let us know where this snuggly cap fleet will be and we'll ensure you don't run out of torpedoes!
---
Coming from someone in Centipede Caliphate, had PANFAM given you a capitals license yet?
---
:saddowns:
---
Naglfar is really really extra bad.
---
You'd be nuts to fly an Astero without the cloak.
---
Don't do it.
---
7300 drop is a lot more than 7300 account. Because people are not always connected.
---
But it can be adjusted because some people are offline or in break and still paying sub to skill.
---
I had 25 omega account before bo (skillfarm), only 2 are active now. One will expire in 5 days and i wont pay it again now (bye bye nyx pilot ;D). 1 player lost can be a lot of omega account.
---
a lil highsec ganking to lift the spirits
---
Jamyl praised be
---
From what I understand, you get tiny little SP injectors for completing tasks. Unless you feel like diving into nullsec exploration immediately with no skills, I’d say go for it for the SP bonuses alone.
---
They were. Just NIP for sov / cloaky camping. Ftn is all imperium now.

As a member of the best alliance ingame. I can assure you we will never join any sort of blue donut group.

Come to Irmalin. goons asset safety them here all the time

Everyone thinks the Astero is an Alpha noob ship b/c it doesn't require T2 skills. Forgetting that it's a Faction ship, and Faction toys aren't for noobs. Let alone trying to make any real profit exploring w/o the ability to Cloak and especially warp Cloaked.
---
- Noob explorers use a T1 frig and stick to High Sec.
---
- Intermediate explorers use a standard Cloak so they can explore more dangerous space and have a hiding spot in case of emergency.
---
- Advanced explorers use a CovOps cloak on a T2 frig so they can actually escape when the going gets tough.
---
- Flashy explorers use an Astero b/c they like to risk 50+ mil for giggles.
---
Yes, even a returning player that has been gone for a year or more, I would also recommend doing them.
---
Uni? You from Australia?

fuckin lold.

you can do t1 explo frigs in null. gonna die a lot but a few pay for... a lot of t1 frigs. FW is also really good for flipping a few m of frigates into bn's of dollas. just takes effort tor esearch the right stuff to buy and then move the 1j to hs to pay haulers channel to move it
---
It takes some of us too long to realize this in Eve.
---
If you enjoy doing PVP, then you find an activity that will fund the level of PVP you do. If you try to PLEX your account, grind out all that ISK and then PVP... you will most likely come up short. WHs are really great for PVP and PVE while also Plexing. Simply because it is more contained, has options based on what you roll WH-wise, and you have overlap in PVP/PVE skills depending on your chosen PVP. Also of note, there is a lot of slightly passive ISK in PI in WHs, if you wanna bother with it. Even if you just sell raw mats and don't care about placement of facilities, it really takes low effort.
---
Either you wad up this huge ball of ISK... then realize you haven't been doing anything with it, or you are constantly doing repetitious PVE content to PLEX your accounts and Eve becomes your 2nd or 3rd job.
---
As for the standings repair, you can buy a glamoreaux 75 booster. Find the 3 locations that offer career agents for amarr. Travel to each of them and complete all the missions Except the last one of each agent. This took me about 6 hours in a t1 dessie on an alpha alt, should go quicker in an assault frig or Dramiel. Once you get to the last one, pop the booster then go back to each location and complete the final mission for each arc. This should only take 30 minutes or less. From here you will have 23+ hours remaining on your booster(more if you have biology trained) . Use that time to complete the sisters of eve epic arc. On the third to last or so mission make sure to choose the correct agent for the standings you want to gain. Once that's all done your amarr standings should be almost 5 points higher, more if you have the social skill trained. If you need more than that you should have enough time on your booster to start Grinding storyline missions. I find combats to be the fastest for level one, but for level 2 and 3 I think distributors missions are better if you can find a nice constellation that has 4+ agents within a couple jumps of each other. Make sure you run the storyline missions as soon as they spawn so you can reset your count (it takes 16 missions of a particular level with a particular corporation to spawn a storyline mission)
---
[*Spock eyebrow*]
---
You were a *pirate*. How could you *not* be more dangerous than them?
---
New accounts also get a 50% off a month of Omega during those opening missions.
---
One dip into a WH 4 jumps from Jita netted 40mil in Data Site loot and I even ignored the Relics (was seeing how loot changed in Data sites since last time I played you ignored Datas and only did Relics).
---
It isn't big isk, but it is easy and relatively low risk in lower class WHs. If you get caught, you probably won't lose much, and your gains should outweigh losses unless you are suuuuuper unlucky.
---
I use the Astero on my scan alt only because he doesn’t have Covops V yet. If IRC the bonus to scanning is better on the Astero unless you have Covops V, then the T2 outshines.
---
&gt;50+ mil
---
&gt;Flashy
---
not even quad warp stabbed?
---
eat a shit
---
Looks cool, but that's not enough to increase fun/hour... :(
---
whatever you do in that area just dont fight smilenwave solo/without alot backup 
---
whatever they use as bait they have 4+ times the stuff in reserve next door waiting nearly always
---
Take lunch to work (PBnJ!), skip Starbucks once or twice a week (or entirely, and buy a Nespresso/Keurig/cold-brew press), and buy your beer only at big box stores. That saves enough money for one account, and probably 2-3.
---
The above plus if you run into fights with larger numbers
---
Use a magnate if you want to do that
---
Like wagyu beef.. we must hand feed them.. massage them..  show them round the clock love,  then slaughter them
---
I found Doomchinchilla
---
Not really. They've pretty much squeezed the max that they can out of Direct3D 9. If imagine though that once they switch to DX12 that will free their artists to really go nuts on the textures of the ships.
---
Covops skill to 4 gives you better scan strength than the astero.  
---
That in addition to the t2 frigs being cheaper makes them (imo) more suited to the role of exploration/scanning.
---
That said for an alpha I'd say just use the t1 explo frigates. Astero is not worth the extra cost especially with no cloak.
---
So, I'm a newbro and have a question regarding Goonswarm's size and power. If alliances getting too big is a problem for EvE, shouldn't there be a limit on the number of corporations that they can have? I realize there are probably a lot of ways to exploit such a mechanic, but I figure I should at least ask.
---
Then why did you leave 03-?
---
If you fit a T1 Explorer and manage to make ISK off sites, it will be all gravy (data/relics that is). Because you will be out almost nothing if you die. If you do this in an Astero, you will need to be very lucky in a WH or NS/LS where this is a more profitable activity. Otherwise, you'll die before you see a good ROI.
---
03-? Never heard of her
---
There's an alternate download in WordPerfect format /s
---
You know, where lumpy deployed away from  a couple weeks after jumping all those supers in and saying that you were gonna change shit.  You couldn't even kill one astra a couple thousand km off your staging keep.
---
m8 I was never in Lumpy. This is Reddit, where the imaginary points are as useless as the flairs.
---
Nobody's ever gonna use a 2b BS rather than a 300m recon to light cynos, unless the BS gets a massive cyno cycle time reduction.  Marauders are hardly used in NS except for running DEDs, in which you can't even light a cyno so no real point making them able to use one though.
---
But being able to MJD while in bastion would be a decent buff to them, so why not.
---
Wow, I never imagined anyone would flair bait shit tier.
---
Show me where the furries touched you
---
I vaguely remember eve poker being a thing. And in game voip.
---
Nope, born and raised American
---
Can’t believe that the sun you see in low setting is a plain circle and had to launch game and check it out myself, was not disappointed
---
I second this. Lots to be learnt and support to be had including SRP while you learn.
---
&gt; i don't mind some temporary drops at all
---
Where does everyone keep coming up the with crap? Its not temporary, it hasn't been temporary since 2013,the game has been slowly losing players since that peak, but recently that slow decline has turned into an avalanche as hilmars new push to randomly and with no warning drop game changing patches on players and call it "chaos". There are plenty of new games coming out over the next few months as the winter game release cycle approaches. If you alienate your players now there is a good chance you won't be getting them back in the long run. And with an Eve related mobile game set to be released in China that will only provide further opportunities to cannibalize the current Eve population.
---
Someone show this to Tuz maybe he'll stop making all those graphs just to complain
---
thats your mom man
---
And the funniest/worst part is, you could see it coming a mile away
---
For a lot of people. My corp was super into it, it made the matches a hell of a lot more exciting, especially the early rounds where you didn't have a clue who the teams were but said, *hey, 50/50, right?*
---
Oh true, I was mistaken. Time to change ships. 
---
I agree with you on that, the price factor does make them more suited for exploration. Especially with it being not IF I lose my ship but WHEN.
---
Also yeah Alpha should stick to T1 with no cloak.
---
/cringe @ another "eve is dying" toxic thread

I never thought i'd see the day CCP comes to the subreddit asking for something.
---
Lol, thats the joke, the rolled into o3- with some other disbanded ex skillu, declared they were the law, and then failed to do jack shit, fed a bunch, couldn't even kill an astra, and finally left in disgrace.
---
In short sir, there is nowhere to point to on your doll cause they did jack shit.
---
Sure are riled up for not even being molested
---
You sure are riled up for not being lumpy.
---
I only originally referenced it to point out their failure and withdrawal from o3-.  just like most of the ex skillu joined, did jack shit, and then left.  It amused me greatly.

I tried it a month ago. You get a few free tech1 ships and about 10 million isk. But it takes quite some time. If you have a better source of income don't waste your time.
---
&gt;That's the joke, Hilmar and falcon and the reddit downvote brigade keep claiming that losing thousands of players in a few months is just the bots getting banned
---
Straw man. All I've ever seen anyone say is that 22,000 accounts being banned has had *an effect* on the PCU, in the downward direction.
---
&gt;they are ignoring the fact that the bots just moved to highsec and started running courier missions and mining in battleships
---
Speculation.
