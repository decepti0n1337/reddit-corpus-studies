Could have applications in smaller scale stuff. The marshal can fit a beastly local tank. Not saying I’d advise it or do it myself. Just saying it’s a possibility.

Leshaks are also popular in WHs, and you cut their spool with that so that's a plus

Then some poor sod at CCP would have to manually check every single submission to make sure it wasn't Adversity tier swastica spam
---
When people refer to a particular regions active time zone, especially Mon-Fri, it typically means around 5 PM - Midnight local time. People have lives.
---
Well you’re abnormal. Most people get up and go to work or school and then play when they get out around 5-6pm local time.
---
Arent those always accompanied by booshers? And logi? I dont know enough about stukas to say much but if theyre anything like gokus then I wouldnt call them blops ships. And its still hit and run tactics, its just another type of it. They are great for going after big targets which is why its a whaling doctrine but its not a fighting one in that sense. Bring some counters and they will leave pretty much instantly (or die).

If you want the REAL elite wormholer list it's one of two things depending on if you're a c5 Corp or a c2 corp.
---
C5 corp: 
---
undock slepnirs.
---
Make sure to have the optimal 2 slepnirs per 1 basi 
---
Warp to the hole
---
Wait for it to be rolled. 
---
Scan new hole, but dont scan past static
---
Reroll close to 300 times during your prime time 
---
C2 corp: 
---
Forget your c5 static exists until an actual fleet jumps in and fucks you
---
Make up some excuse about how you aren't really wormholers to justify the loss
---
Rinse and repeat
---
Yes.  Both would be fine from my point of view.
---
Have a look in the mirror pal.
---
But Brain...what would we do with a new static to Delve? NARF!
---
That's like saying the sun is intel because we can tell there's rays coming from it. Great job, very broad and generic. 
---
Is it actionable intel?  Based on previous MERs, have you done something differently?  If not, then I dunno wtf you are having concerns with.
---
I run burners and 500 is on most of my daredevils. Overload + implants.

Very nice!

Thats fine, I love killing dreads in subs.
---
Losing CCP Dr. Eyo was a mistake
---
You misunderstand, I'm perfectly aware that being a criminal in-game is a perfectly acceptable way to play. What's wrong with calling them criminals when that's the whole point of their alliance?
---
For PvP Guards are better.
---
Anything that has shot at you or your drones is a foe, missiles go after the closest valid target when they are fired
---
If you’re living in wspace and are smart you live in a hole with a wormhole static that you can both roll for logistics/pew and roll for pve when the mood arises.
---
&gt; Nah that was what we used to call wardeccing everyone in sight in highsec, and some people thought it was problematic and needed to be "fixed".
---
Oh. I don't really understand why the term is inapplicable here, then.
---
&gt; literally nobody thinks that this sort of thing is a problem.
---
I'm pretty sure that's a controversial issue, and not just because there are players who can't handle a fight. The issue is only exacerbated by how no one can seem to agree on how the wardec system should work.

---
And honestly, if you somehow have missed that they really dislike the blocs and are doing their best to mess with them then I have no idea where youre looking. Falcon has been spouting off about the umbrella aswell. Its really not news. I can probably find you tens of sources on the matter but I dont really care enough to do that.

That's not USTZ. You don't seem to understand how this works.

There were tons of options. But they are being disruptive for the sake of just being disruptive. CCP Rise admitted that there were better options but said they want to choose the nuclear option simply for the sake of chaos. Like they are being very literal with chaos era and I have no real clue as to why. Its like a middlefinger to most players honestly. 
---
But CCP has always been edgy and immature in my opinion so this doesnt really strike me as odd behaviour.
---
Took them long enough to figure out xix were pro feeders
---
Holy shit, I did not know this at all. Gonna have to try this in-game!
---
Yeah, I read those. But when I put the jar file in the directory nothing magically happened. Those sparse directions don't actually say how to execute the program.
---
Not my favourite, but it's not that bad either... I guess I've read way too many comics for it to bother me that much.
---
Noooo i like my cheap Bhaals!
---
&gt;The issue is only exacerbated by how no one can seem to agree on how the wardec system should work. 
---
Well, players who aren't wet blankets were pretty happy with the old wardec system. Whinging carebears won't be happy with any wardec system at all. Then you have CCP, who have decided that they only want wardecs to target structures, not players. Obviously nobody is happy with this except CCP.
---
Nevertheless, it is done, wardecs have been roundly and thoroughly nerfed, and nearly all wardeccers have either been put out of business or consolidated into PIRAT. Anyone who is still crying about "blanket decs" at this point, when wardecs have already almost entirely removed from the game, is obviously never going to be happy with any wardec system at all.
---
i dont rember how long ago it was but you had to have a high standing with the faction that owned the space to ancor posses but a bug in the code of a update fucked it up and ccp said it was more trouble to fix than it was worth so they left it in
---
They don't tackle fast enough anyway, especially with the fact they insta web.
---
He is likely being alpha's.
---
&gt; for playing within the games rules
---
I mean you do realize that they make the rules right? 
---
If something makes sense to do then they should do it. Empires attacking capsuleers that they hate is already in the game and common. So common they have a system in place to raise reputations swiftly.
---
Why would they let a structure that belongs to people they hate be anchored in their space? 
---
Also any nerf to anything could be considered punishment for playing within the rules. "Oh you're nerfing rorqual mining. STOP PUNISHING ME"  
---
Your logic is bad and you should feel bad
---
If youre not mining your own ore. Youre gonna have a bad day
---
You also can't close the gates.

I am trying to do the 3rd career tutorial mission in the explorer career. I cannot equip the Core Probe Launcher because I do not know Astrometrics I. I have to buy the skill for 500,000 ISK. Am I supposed to be paying 500,000 ISK to do a tutorial mission?
---
Mate i've probably played for longer than you, and if you think ecm is literally unusable then i feel bad for you
---
Since you aren't a real wormholer let me explain it. 
---
J space corps as a whole rat out of their static. Not every member has a farm hole.
---
Join goons with 2000 corps start vote. Take over n disband.
---
They're also used in for high sec escalation farming, but again not really the issue that the change will address.
---
CCP is fair
---
I know
---
You should get the skill book for free. Check yo inventory yo
---
Of course?
---
I’ll take that as a no.
---
It's a numbers game, one day you may hit it big, bit of a dice roll i think. You can make a boatload of money
---
Actually it's your logic that is terrible. A nerf is something that changes something in the game broadly for everyone. It shapes the sandbox if you will. If they changed the game in a manner that a rule like not being able to anchor a structure if theres negative standings or whatever would apply to the whole playerbase that would be perfectly fine. 
---
  
---
But arbitrarily applying rules only to particular groups for whatever reason would be a direct intervention with activities inside the sandbox which is something CCP doesn't want. 
---
(And also it would be fucking stupid. If you don't like what they do do something about it yourself. Wardec their structure holding corp for example)
---
Skip ECM and fly damps and disruptors. 
---
Damps and disruptors are always effective. ECM is rolling the dice. 
---
Disrupt a leshak and laugh at his reset spool so long as you keep it on him. 
---
You can scan res damp logistics and make them the like 20 seconds to lock a cruiser then just swap targets and have 20 seconds of rep free damage guaranteed. 
---
ECM is a meme in 80% of situations
---
It allows hunters to hunt even more silently- those people with multiple accounts who rely on wh sound to alert them, so they can dock up their pve ships... They'll be at a disadvantage
---
There isn't anything in any of those other categories. Is there somewhere else I can look?
---
Those things in the first image; yeah. They're just words. They mean nothing in the modern world.
---
I didn't consider this cuz I never seem, so thank you much
---
all i will add is that eve as long as your a paying member you can set up to 500 skills in a q and not log in for a year you will train skill as long as your subed on the free to play end you cant add more than 24 houres of skill so you have to log in ever so often 
---
my old corp took in a group of 5 real life friends and all 5 of them loved it they did end up in the end spliting up to do there own thing but far as i know they are all still friends

---
More or less would of been my response lol
---
rude, but whatever
---
Ok Mr "Highsec should be safe"
---
The trick is 2 nestors + leshaks to taste, everyone can refit easily for site / drifter and easy reps. I run 2 nestors 3 leshaks and and an eos, garrison/stronghold is ~13mins and drifter is ~10mins with 2 leshaks doing 2.1k dps ramped and 1 doing 1.8k.
---
edit - love being downvoted for pointing out a direct cause...
---
That's actually a good idea
---
Yeah it is based of the Adjusted Cost @ ME0
---
From my indy sheet these are the current 'Adjusted Cost' for 1 of each of the reaction.

Stalagg anyone?
---
Have you tried logging in more?
---
Yes.
---
&gt; a rule like not being able to anchor a structure if theres negative standings or whatever would apply to the whole playerbase that would be perfectly fine
---
&gt;applying rules only to particular groups
---
He didn't say that?
---
It effects everyone in the same way. Have a lot of nerds with low standings and you can't anchor in hi-sec.
---
&gt; Added a Buy all option in the Kill report window.
---
Small change but saves a few awkward steps of saving/simulating or whatever it was to finally find the buy all button.
---
You don't agree with removing almost completely riskless gameplay that can indefinitely tackle someone?

i would just like to add that 99% of us will give you advice if you ask but putting a bounty on the guy just give him what he wanted Salt thats why people like me do the tings we do
---
Fighting against SS are the best fights. Appreciate their hold my vodka attitude.
---
the difference is those pservers never had the support or attention wow has had on theirs. im also from daoc but im playing classic and am more excited than daoc releasing f2p or if they made a classic. because dark ages didnt age well. wow is much more fluid and in all encompassing much more fun. I miss daoc but it would take a full time dev team to remake that. probably a larger one than classic wow. cannot deny that those server were full of bugs and bad minmaxxing 8mans.
---
They moved to Curse. Sorry I forgot to include that as part of their update.
---
This.
---
The issue isn’t titans and Supers, the issue is the chain of escalation and application of damage. No one would give a single flying fuck about cynos and super umbrellas if they can’t apply damage to anything smaller than a capital.
---
never?!
---
Man you're gonna have to dumb that down a lot more for me. Recons and black ops I assume are ships. Are cynos the wormhole generators?
---
&gt; Ships will now automatically enter warp after three minutes of attempting to align and reach the required speed.
---
Does this include those NPC haulers that get stuck till downtime on some Gallente stations?
---
i was like hmm, that sounds specific to mouth trumpet, then i looked at the the person who posted....
---
I am telling you man - cracks are forming. It’s not like TEST would lose space or anything but you are RED and XiX switch away from losing the war. And now it makes no sense for them to stay in Legacy. Siberian Squads originally joined coalition to help revive Russian Drone lands idea with skill urself gone there is plenty of space and FRAT can afford to let them take C-J.  The interests of RED/XiX and Legacy are no longer aligned. 
---
I will not be shocked if RED and XiX rejoin their original coalition in the Drone Regions. It just makes sense.
---
High class space is dead. They could all have one if they wanted.
---
Um, it's Eastern Daylight Time. He's reading his watch.
---
Is anomic agent a burner mission? All I know is I had a decent T2 fit Hawk (light T2 missiles though, so maybe 200dps) with around 38k EHP / great resists... I took an anomic agent mission in Guristas space thinking “this guy is dead!”, warped in and it blew me up like I was nothing in under 25 secs... I barely had time to see how much I could damage it. Not trying that again
---
The payout is the asset safety retrieval cost. No faucet, no abuse.
---
I mean I'm usually on the grr snuff train but this bonkers.
---
Lol this issue is as old as the game. Sucked having to just read about the Colossus races while stuck at school.
---
It's always fun hearing people from superblocks rush to the defense of the little guy. Outposts didn't do that, but they locked your stuff inside. I remember weeklong hellcamps to keep things from escaping. That doesn't happen anymore.
---
Edgy. You must be good with the ladies.
---
Sure if I could re-arrange a busy null gate to an empty hsec route, and call it a way to my home...WH carebears can control the risk.
---
He didn't say it but if someone says they should be punished because they're a criminal corp and get hinted at the fact criminal corps don't exist and then someone basically says (paraphrased) "yeah but they're evil people, right?" then it sure sounds like something should be done about them despite no mechanics justifying it just because "grrrr i don't like them" and that was the point i argued from. 
---
The answer to my comment about lacking mechanics simply contained subjective perception, and how it should be possible to even apply any mechanics to groups that are just subjectively criminals without having to say "alliance x can't do this because y" is a mystery to me.  
---
Remember, empire standings and security status are not the same. Security status is what marks you as criminal in the game. A corp might have standings (or at least had), but they do not have a security status. 
---
(Despite that while im not proficient in ganking i don't think you lose standings with a faction when ganking unless you attack a player that directly belongs to that faction. I honestly doubt code as a whole has empire standings that are so bad that the empires would dislike them)

Kind of weird that it wasn't this late that last 3 years
---
You are a sick and sad fuck, that's what you like to do judging by your level of dementia. Seriously, do the world a favor and stop breathing.
---
Makes sense.
---
Force recons are a class of T2 cruisers and black ops are a class of T2 battleships. Both are known for having very weak defenses. Capital ships (very large ships that are outlawed in high sec space) are able to "jump" (instantly teleport) to these cynos, and Titans (largest ships in the game) are able to "bridge" to them (jump a fleet of non-capital ships). 
---
Before, any ship was able to fit the cyno generator and light these cynos. There was a problem where whenever you would try to get into a somewhat fair fight, the ship(s) you attacked would just light a cyno and have a bunch of capitals jump on you and sweep the floor with you. Now, only certain types of ships (that are relatively easy to kill) are able to light the cynos.
---
You’re not wrong. But he’s willing to buy one.
---
What the fuck is a pve shit doing taking bait for a fight? That is hilariously silly. And you're right, I'm not the sort to boast about venture kills. Nor any other kills tbh. I don't kill shit for the bragging rights, I do it cause I like seeing shit explode.
---
My bad but you can eject during pvp.
---
Also dont have to be like that mate. Honest error, I dont make a habit of ejecting myself lol.
---
Nope. Make ship collision do damage directly to hull, give freighters and industrials a bonus against collision damage. No more babies first f1 anchor fleets and now you have to reinforce your ships to be able to hold a target by bumbing. If it takes to long you'll just destroy your own shit. As for freighters and big miners getting stuck on structures and asteroids idk maybe use undock pings and dont try flying your rorq between asteroids.
---
holy shit look who it is.  I had no idea you still played lol
---
Lol Siberian Squad are master feeders who are they kidding
---
I own the comany. We do a LOT of time waiting for something to happen. We can't scedule when our customers are going to have something break down, burn down, or blow up. Might as well play Eve.

I've never had a problem moving stuff in that range
---
I have 10 signatures in my hole tonight. Each one is a wormhole. I have enough chaos going on thank you.
---
It's still a subjective perception and they shouldn't be limited because of that when theres no actual system in place which determines this. (I mean, ask the average code member whether he thinks what they do is criminal and then ask their victims. I'm pretty sure the answers won't match)
---
What are you talking about?
---
CCP totally knows what it's doing and iterates on the game!
---
Sounds like they wouldn't make as much money as they do by selling Skill Extractors and Injectors.
---
I'm most confused by the fact that it's mixed dmg mods.... Why...
---
Isogen was already crashing because or having to mine our belts and the imbalance in nullsec ore anoms. It's not "magically moon mining"!
---
Why wasn't he saved? Out of umbrella range?
---
Lived in wh space because I've never joined a wh corp... incursions because I didn't care
---
Adrenaline is a hell of a drug
---
It's pretty obviously either or, or both. It's not like you couldn't fix the issue with lose isogen yields OR higher isogen consumption OR both.
---
It wasnt.  It literally was moon mining...
---
the fuck is a burner mission?
---
I am dabbling on and off. You will know when I am back for real :).
---
Plenty of wormhole doctrines disagree.
---
and yea that's a whole other problem,  I have no idea the politics of the various NPC null regions, just looking at the raw isk/lp conversions.
---
Failed damage control.  It is funny how much noise you guys make when you get new allies but “forget” to mention reset :). 
---
And it is not your typical reset either - Siberian Squads will be fleeting up with Winter...
---
Nano carriers in a group are fun. Jump in, dunk, warp out. Fit it right and you’ll warp about as fast as a cruiser and align in 10seconds with a 500Mn
---
Lets HICs use cynos
---
upvotes to the left
---
not using moon landing units OMEGALUL
---
Every major group uses Guards over Nestors, Guards are much more resistant to neuting (better range control) and stronger against boosers (harder to get close to them without being scrammed).
---
Bring back BF 2142.
---
And players wonder why a group of thugs like CODE exists.
---
reset?  They showed up occasionally for fights dude.
---
thought goons were gonna raise the prices a bunch or something?
---
&gt; not using kirins and daredevils to do burners 
---
LUL
---
AOM  come through
---
You get referral bonuses, gifted skills from carrier agents, there are accelerators that make a big diffrence to low SP players given easy at every event, there is a new toon locked accelerator and 1M SP in the $5 DLC pack, for this month you get 10k SP for almost 0 effort.
---
I remember what the first while of playing was like in 2008, and last month I made a new toon and did the agents and epic arc to see how fast I could get into a cruiser and L3 missions as Alpha and no ISK injection from my main, it is all WAY better now a days.
---
Do not shoot the messenger here. That’s how they called it. It’s in Russian though - wall of text full of feelings :). I summarized the gist of it.
---
As I mention in the first sentence this will not change the way the war is going but it may give RA and XiX and excuse they may be looking for. Winter has what they want - Legacy does not.
---
Lol.  You are still just as stupid as ever.
---
Do not be salty. I did not reset you. 
---
This time.
---
&gt;pirate lp can net you as much as 1,200 ISK per LP
---
very inaccurate. guristas alone, if you do gilas/worms, will net you 1800-1900 rn, implants can net you over 2k per lp.
---
No, the correct response is: "Sure, we'll take your offer of  buy out at 1b isk.  Once you pay up we'll start the process of moving" then ignore him.
---
Lol the next time you reset me will be the first time haha.  Though I don't know where you'd find another alliance to run.
---
They need to get rid of any skills that affect the performance of a ship, weapons, mods. Everyone should just be able to fly them the same. Only thing you train for are the ships themselves. 
---
They need to remove skill loss for T3.
---
Add skill loss to super capitals. 
---
Make a titan weapon like a super doomsday, if  equipped when the titan dies the pilot dies with it. 
---
Double the speed of SP for everything else. 
---
20% bonus on top for your own racial skills.
---
You’re being a little short sighted. It’s more about macroeconomics than microeconomics.
---
More people joining the game and staying = more overall skill injectors.
---
If it's 6AM in your time zone, the event is not in your time zone. That's what I'm saying and it's pretty clear from the thread.
---
Not raiding 18 hours a day noob :3
---
I don't remember saying that they should be limited, so if I did please link the post so I can have my memory checked.
---
I'm serious, BTW. Sometimes I forget things, and it can get pretty bad.
---
Holy shit, first progod sighting since the war started
---
Only a few reasons to use ecm:
---
Jam logi
---
Jam entosis ships
---
Jam ships landing in a gat camp so no one else dies
---
you didn't but it sounds like that in the context of the comment i initially answered to. if that wasnt the intention i am sorry
---
&gt; Obviously nobody is happy with this except CCP.
---
I don't think they're happy with it either. Or maybe they're just divided on the subject like we are, it's not like a company makes everyone who works there part of a hive-mind.
---
I wish. I’ve got a dead c5 chain and delve :(
---
Leave FI.RE to go join a bunch of botters. Still wont change much.
---
I think they just need to remove the idea of selling injectors. Let us extract and reapply skills to the same character every 3 months. 
---
This way if you don't like your path or CCP nerfs something to shit, you can change your direction and not have your time and effort wasted.
---
&gt; They said xxDeathxx are shit and are constantly feeding.

C-L wasn't enough of a hint?

Eh, it's alright. I'm personally of the opinion that the system currently in place could be improved, but I'm also entirely aware of my own ignorance and therefore not inclined to voice my ideas until I get more information. At the moment they can be summed up as "find a way to implement good/bad consequences and make high/low/null security ratings intuitive without ruining what makes EVE unique."
---
Needless to say, it's unlikely I'll ever be the one to untangle *that* Gordian knot...
---
Hanzo is the most risk averse fc in the game wtf you talkin about...
---
Stop using autopilot if you are and warp to zero. The time that it takes for them to lock you and pay attention to you being there should give you enough time to warp away. If not fit inertial stabilizers in the low slots. Prop
---
woah there progod, those are some mighty big rocks to be throwing in that fine glass house you have.
---
Didn’t make one
---
Learning is for smart people.
---
Oh, don't get me wrong. I'm not in favor of Skill Injectors in any way. Not even remotely... I think it's complete horseshit. Skill Injectors in particular, but PLEX in general, are the literal embodiment of "Pay 2 Win". The harder you wave your credit card, the closer you can get your brand new character to someone who has been playing the game for a decade or more.
---
All I meant is, they will never go for it. It's too profitable for them to leave such a wide gap between noobs and vets, encouraging noobs to feel like the only way to compete is to wave that credit card harder and harder.
---
OP: shout out to YONDU (sp?), these guys are great
---
in local: blight fuck off
---
that bit had me laughing. solid video. some of your mistakes had me on the brink of pulling my hair...so kudos for airing them.
---
Why does the "issue" need to be "fixed"?
---
EVE's economy is so great precisely because there's so little government meddling.
---
TIL it was CCP Eyo and not CCP I/O
---
&gt;making the whole game faster.
---
EVE Online has already gotten too fast.
---
A special way of RMTing may be? Load the freighter in such a way so it should drop around 50% of its value(because the value is so well spread). Pretty expensive way thought, you lose the half, but another half of ISK is well laundered.
---
Not sure if you have selective memory or if you just forgot the fleet comps for that fort.
---
Let me help: You had more numbers than us in Nightmares alone. These were supported by logi, a pair of huginns, a FAX and a Rev + Naglfar.  We were flying around 12-15 Phantasms, supported by a couple of scimitars, and our own webbing huginn (I think just one?). 
---
To recap why we were there: we turned up because there was a) neutral fortizar coming out at a stupid time to whore on and b) a fight. Upon arrival we saw we were outformed - which isn't a big deal, we can usually work around that. We scouted more reinforcements too, on your side, from a range of groups (forming voltron lmao). 
---
For a fort we don't own, and don't care about much. This isn't really something we're going to suicide a fleet for the chance of 1-2 nightmare kills. It just doesn't matter &amp; is a bad trade.
---
We had a lot of cracks at killing nightmares ("spearfishing"), shooting at them from somewhere between our max lock range and your huginn web range. When we dove closer, your Huginn's would web phantasms or scimitars, and nightmares would rush in to try to score some kills - some-times successful. We were definitely punching up here against more ships, more damage, more reps. Our advantage is damage mitigation through signature and speed - which we can't leverage when we're slowed by a huginn. 
---
You're making a point that because you didn't have *even more* on field, we should've kept repeating a failed experiment to feed ships into nightmares. I'm at a loss why you think I'd regard your suggestion as anything other than dumb-fuck retarded. Which is now how I default view you. Well earned lol. Thanks for the tactical advice, I wasn't even FC, but you clearly have no idea and just want to chestbeat and prove a point on something you are both wrong on, and don't understand. Thanks for the amusement o/.

Yet, here you are ragging on this guy for something he didn't even say, while saying yourself that something that looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, and is called a duck by the people who make the duck, isn't a duck because of people's feelings about ducks.  
---
I guess people will find a way to argue about anything these days. Sheesh.
---
POCOs reinforced in system? -&gt; seed hole for easy oracle kills.
---
Eve is basically in its 16th year of beta.
---
All of last year, the feedback Kalkin and I gave to Brisc to take to the CSM was to straight up remove it from spodumain.
---
Those... are all terrible ideas.
---
- Character skills equate to performance in EVERY game out there. Whether it's proficiency points with your new dagger or sword. Or ranks in marksmanship and endurance traits. Skills are a video game staple. And in Eve, the ships we fly and the mods we equip, really ARE the characters in the game. Our meatsuits are just a brain (in a body) in a jar, serving as a vessel to hold skill points. Training to be better or worse at certain ships or mods, is what makes Eve... Eve.
---
- Skill loss for T3Cs was a gimmick. And you'll notice they haven't brought it back since. It's b/c they realized it's a dumb gimmick, and nobody likes it. But it's a fitting gimmick for those ships, b/c they're flying Swiss Army knives. If you want a HAC, it becomes a HAC. If you want a Recon, it becomes a Recon. But you better hope you don't die, or you eject in time, otherwise you'll be retraining some stuff.
---
- Like I said, it's a gimmick that hasn't been repeated since. There's no reason Supers should be penalized like that. They just became too cheap to build. Once upon a time they were so outrageously expensive, they were regarded as myths and legends. We just need to do something about the inflation.
---
- Pilots die all the time. That's what Clones are for. If you're saying the character should be completely deleted or something, that's retarded.
---
- I'm fine with Alphas gaining SP at X rate. And I'm okay with Omegas gaining at 2X rate. I think they need to scrap all the Learning Attributes nonsense, and just stick with that. X and 2X and that's it.
---
- I will admit, I would like to see some kind of focus on races. As it stands, they're utterly meaningless. It's perfectly legit to play a Gallente character, flying a Minmatar ship, with Caldari Navi fittings, fighting for the Amarr militia. That's dumb. There should be some kind of benefit to playing Amarr, flying Amarr, fitted with Amarr, fighting for Amarr.
---
I agree with your conclusion. But isogen is wonky BECAUSE of "government meddling" and a change would only be a return to the conditions we had before the patently-ridiculous rorqual mining came into being.
---
&gt;  In principle the Nergal can do any Frigate class Burner Mission 
---
Got a Nergal fit that will do the burner Dramiel?

Attribute remaps.

Make dark ochre great again

Send them to me and I'll test them in my rig.
---
a hard counter killing them doesn't really say much. That's true of any doctrine. Are you going to jump a caracal fleet into a waiting brawling fleet? fuck no.
---
The existence and use of logi and other support adds to their survivability and only reinforces their status as a fleet that can stay on grid and fight it out.
---
They can hit and run, yes. They can blops, yes. They can also stay on grid and kill shit.
---
What? People wanted to stop mining dark ochre in null before moon mining was in full swing. And that's because the price of isogen was already low and dropping further.
---
Pye+iso=lots of trit/mex would be dank

My first Eve event, after playing for 9 years, was Evesterdam 2019.  I didn't know anyone at all there.  And I had an absolutely FANTASTIC time!  Every person I met was friendly, inviting, and just all around fun to hang out with.  Having gone to several other sci-fi conventions like DragonCon in Atlanta, etc. I can say Eve nerds are the BEST nerds.  They dress nicer, **shower**, have good manners and are overall classier.  They are super friendly and inclusive to everyone who plays Eve, whether in their group or not, whether an in-game "enemy" or not.  All of the event organizers were fantastic.  CCP guys/gals were awesome.  The PVP tournament was exciting to fly in.  I had an absolute blast.
---
So I will definitively be at Eve Vegas this year and every Eve event I can make from now on.  Tickets are purchased, hotel room reserved, hype is at maximum level, just overall very much looking forward to it.  And this time I'll actually know some people before meeting them at the event!  And small confession....I've never been to Vegas before, even though I'm from the US.
---
If you go, please feel free to tap me on the shoulder and introduce yourself.  I'll be the nerd in the rattlesnake skin jacket, can't miss me.
---
o7 seeya there!
---
Salt truck.
---
Darwinism in action
---
Has that always been the case or only since all the pro-null bloc changes?
---
Company of Heroes still rocks.  Not COH2 though.
---
Did you really just write this much when you don't even understand what spearfishing is? "We had a lot of cracks at killing nightmares" Is not spear fishing using two combined booshs chained from command destroyers is.
---
By doing that with some of the times I mentioned when most of us were burned out and there was a random afk nightmare on the mino which would of been a easy spearfish he's not moving and he would of been out of range of reps and webs to stop you from killing him.
---
You don't didn't try it you have no idea what your talking about by saying you did. You wouldn't of repeated anything cause you didn't try it once. I'm glad you view me as a dumb retard because your lack of comprehension of game mechanics. (spear fishing is shooting from range lul) I'm glad your so confident on game mechanics to say I'm wrong when you don't even know what I'm talking about.
---
Thanks for the amusement o/
---
Also makes it able to cloak while still under gate cloak
---
Usually it's a hundred avatars for one jackdaw tho
---
Ah, I got my dates mixed up on the change, my bad.
---
hey guys just help me summon some water real quick...
---
It's been a thing for a while. I did that on my mage.
---
yep, go in unprepared and that's what happens.  They are mostly a fitting puzzle with pretty high skill requirements and there are a decent number of guides out there once you get them down they are nicely rewarding.
---
&gt;The titan is no more the start of the game than level 60 is.
---
Having played both games, it doesn't work that way.
---
What did I do?!
---
They too busy with trig implants to work on shield slaves and other pirate implants
---
Here's what Nestor prices have done over the last six months (and a small trend extrapolation for the next two weeks).
---
&amp;#x200B;

[Nestor Trends](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/508789252293787649/613932254787534918/the_forge-33472-1-2019_08_22.png)
---
That's all they're good for now. With the application changes, they're just good for generating fighter killmails if you're facing a reasonably competent opponent.
---
Maybe if they reversed the application changes but that would mean subs being killed by carriers again and we cant have that. 
---
Carriers have pretty much only ever been anti subcap caps. no two carriers have or will kill a dread or super. with application changes, they're not great against subs. Next month will be the final nail in the coffin.
---
The actual good part of this change is that I will be free of my caps again. Never much liked flying them anyway.
---
jump in a c1-3 and there s core probes out? the hisec static is close to a trade hub - time to export/import :))
---
i swear regular core probes are the seagulls of wh life
---
i've not always been a superblock member.
---
Their hard counter is pretty much any subcap doctrine (atleast those with range), its way wider than single hard counter.
---
Yes but the very usage of said support ships that add to their survivability is what makes them a non blops doctrine. They are fit differently and you know it, they are also used differently and you know this as well. Putting them in the same category as a regular blops bomber simply because they can take bridges but never do isnt really viable.
---
Ye not arguing against that. I dont really get where you wanna go with this? If they are not used strictly as blops ships, which they arent since the mostly (if not always) take WHs with support ships that cant be blops bridged, then they simply arent a blops doctrine. 
---
Now if you want to discuss how viable they actually are in combat sure we can do that. But you cant compare them to regular blops bombers and you know it. Which is what the discussion was, its not stuka fleets that are being used in a majority of the cases during the blackout. Its ships with cloaks, alot of the time just straight bombers that go after excavs. Saying these are there for the "good fights" is absolute bullshit. Likewise in the case of a blopsdrop. Bombers in general are there for killing high EHP targets and they excel at that but they are not mainline doctrines in that sense.
---
and their response was ?
---
Nit that I agree with his idea, the difference is in generic mmos you have to pick skills and whatever using some kind of limited resource. In eve you can be the best at everything all at once.
---
I take 25.000 plex and unsubbed Last Weekend. Time for an eve breake and switching to swtor.
---
79k optimal, 125k max.
---
&gt;Character skills equate to performance in EVERY game out there. Whether it's proficiency points with your new dagger or sword. Or ranks in marksmanship and endurance traits. Skills are a video game staple. And in Eve, the ships we fly and the mods we equip, really ARE the characters in the game. Our meatsuits are just a brain (in a body) in a jar, serving as a vessel to hold skill points. Training to be better or worse at certain ships or mods, is what makes Eve... Eve.
---
This is True more in PvE games , for PvP better to keep things equal and let personal skill and tactics prevail over who has played longer. Just cause you pair more to play longer should not be the defining factor.
---
&gt; Skill loss for T3Cs was a gimmick. And you'll notice they haven't brought it back since. 
---
Ok so we agree, remove that shit then. 
---
&gt;  b/c they're flying Swiss Army knives.  
---
Sounds like capitals , so let's apply it there. 
---
&gt; Pilots die all the time. That's what Clones are for. If you're saying the character should be completely deleted or something, that's retarded. 
---
I am suggesting an incentive for the most powerful players in the game to make a risk vs reward decision. If they want the big big gun, put their lives on the line for it.  Why not ? It's not going to be forced so let people roll the dice. It's like flying around with 1000 plex in your ship. It's a choice. 
---
&gt; I'm fine with Alphas gaining SP at X rate. And I'm okay with Omegas gaining at 2X rate. I think they need to scrap all the Learning Attributes nonsense, and just stick with that. X and 2X and that's it. 
---
We kind of on the same page so let devs work out the details, but I assure you a lot of players see the time to train and the cost and say fuck it, neither or value for money or time. This is costing us potential players. 
---
My suggestion is just to make races matter, a bonus to training ones racial line could be a start.
---
Trash guide. If you sit around WH entrance d-scanning like a twat you will get blown up by whatever cloaky T3 is camping it or some rando jumping into the system. Always make a safe BM and then scan from there.
---
dude, to each his own when it comes to playstyles but here s a few things i learned that sour the eve experience:
---
- playing alone ( that is without human interaction)
---
- trying hard to plex by playing
---
- flying what you can t afford to lose
---
- asking for instant/fast gratification
---
on times where I didn t have time for pvp, I did pve, mining, hauling, a bit of trading, PI, exploration, agency missions etc. 
---
Those you can do on your own time and if you can refrain from putting an isk/hour tag on them, can really be fun pastimes
---
On the off chance this isn't bait, in order to do that you need to be part of a group that trusts you enough to tell you about their titan movements. Otherwise, you will hotdrop someone and then someone else will hotdrop you, and you will die
---
&gt; Make ship collision do damage directly to hull
---
You'd have an entire fleet explode the moment a large group came out of warp from being near-on-top of each other. EVE's physics simulation isn't that advanced.
---
So they now wanna control the war also?
---
There is constant access to thera...
---
Yea he does. They are literally putting a gun to his head and forcing him.
---
You're an incredibly disingenuous person.
---
can't use slaves with it
---
Let the ore fight back.
---
You can but only for certain items that arent liquid. Its like having a used car dealership versus a grocery store. You'll sell more groceries more frequently but you need to only sell one car every so often to be just as, if not more profitable.
---
My 550 ISK/LP estimation also comes from selling directly to buy orders rather than setting up you own sell orders.
---
I thought I was the only one that read it that way.
---
As fast as you can run them? The Impetux boosters greatly improved the amount you can run but that gravy train ends in October? iirc.
---
Press F for my boi Btr0n, rest in spaghetti never forgetti.
---
Its an average over all the pirate factions, selling directly to buyorders. Calm your tits.
---
But did you buy bulk of it or no.
---
This post deserve some love
---
Individuals are flagged when they do something yes. This wasn't about individuals though but about the whole group.
---
And of course everything around it is blue.
---
Because retaking an ihub while loosing 5 isnt really a Victory?
---
You can't though. Each ship and fit has a purpose. If you try to make a fit that can do anything, you'll just end up being terrible at everything. 
---
Like trying to fit 1 short range gun, 1 long range gun, 1 fast drone, 1 slow drone... You think you've got every base covered. But really you've got a lot of wasted resources because only 1 thing is useful at any given time.
---
Sure, you can train for lots of things. But you have to commit to a purpose when you undock.
---
Because most Tapi line members dont really understand whats going on.
---
Later in Vanilla it did, I'm not actually sure if the version they're using is late enough for that though. That's a good point.
---
Because dreddit, the main corp of test, is literally a reddit sperglord corp.
---
The competence of eve players had always been overstated by its community
---
Good thing Eve isn't just a PvP game. The skills and stuff factor into how your ship functions. Your PvP skill factors into how you apply those functions during the fight.
---
SP loss is unique to T3Cs because they are unique. Capitals don't have subsystems, and don't become other ship classes. They do what they do. Carriers launch Fighters. Fax go around healing. Titans bridge and blow shit up. Now if there was a T3 Capital that could swap out mods and become a Fax or a Dread or a Carrier, then we could talk about SP loss.
---
1.4bil very big very wow.
---
Where will you spend all that money
---
First a local blackout, now a total hud blackout
---
The music helps
---
They're shooting a blue. Likely botting
---
The change will really fuck over my small lowsec alliance, who are planning on rebooting after summer sometime.
---
Im one of the more eager to reform but the ones who are on the fence will look at this and say "fuck that".
---
Personally, im in favour of hard hitting changes but this means no more solo suitcase, which people will say was a luxury but Ive often been online alone at night moving stuff.. what now? Ive got to join a bigger group or just fuck my audacity? Im not suggesting this is your attitude, of course but it definitely is that if some others on here.
---
Oh I did the join a huge nullsec alliance thing and a small Corp in a WH too.  It was fun but I rarely want to sit and play for hours and you just can't do much in short play sessions.  Eve's a time consuming game and I just wasn't at a time in my life where I could or wanted to put in the time.
---
The trading corp was my thing I could do with alts when not playing my main in a corp.  It ended up being most of what I did due to time constraints.  Paying by isk was just common sense once you have a few billion laying around with no plan for it.  It's a weird compulsion I kept that thing running long after retiring the main and just building up skills I never used.
---
Firing the game up after years away and just seeing the interface was a quick reminder that I don't want to commit the time Eve needs to be enjoyable.  It's a really cool game but it's just not for me, at least not now.
---
Stories like OPs sure make it tempting to try anyway though.
---
Most of the effects in eve make them look like wizzards in space..
---
All those caps will still be available locally, which will mean no fights in times where there would have before but who knows what other changes might come or just how the meta might adapt. 
---
Im not a fan of the changes but I'll still watch and see what comes of it all.
---
And if ccp got it right and caps where balanced against  subs, what happened to the small guy on the block? N+3?
---
Botters have a difficult time figuring out Reddit. That's why.
---
Thanks ... I had figured this out the hard way unfortunately, as I was auto-warping to the stargate! I starting warping to zero after this, but the next two times they got me was when I emerged from a stargate and they were waiting on the other side.
---
This is pretty clever.
---
🤔
---
Thanks, I will give this a try as well. They didn’t one-shot, but some very solid damage, that was combined with some beams that they had. I did get away with only shield damage with my micro warp drive once, which certainly got the heart racing. Do you mean to use these to just tank your way through the gate?
---
Post fiterroni dont wana spend dataroni

The vanilla wow private servers were *very* popular until blizzard clamped down on them, I think there's many more people who enjoy classic wow than you think

Hey our 1v1 :D
---
Sorry, other places in the world have different work cultures than what you're accustomed to. Hope you can be a little more open-minded next time before jumping to the kitchen drawer for tinfoil. )))
---
Glad you think so
---
Very cool about the cloaking fit. I think they are out of my ISK now, but I have wanted to try them for a while and will save up the skills. 
---
I really could have bad luck with the Triglavians ... I did want to see them, because I think their ships are cool. And I learned that they are on a whole different level than the Guristas Pirates.
---
Thanks for the mission help. I trained Connections after googling why my character couldn’t get anything beyond the Level 1 missions, but I think I still have some things to learn on the Level 1 ones for now anyway.
---
Is there no paste as plain text in the Windows world? Control-Option-Shit-V does the trick on the Mac.

That is great to know, thank you! Was worried about exactly the skill check you mentioned.
---
I have a ryzen 2600 with an MSI B450 Gaming Plus.
---
I did a lot of research when I bought it and it was pretty much the best bang per buck. 
---
As the other lad suggested, you could get the 3600 and put it into same mobo. 
---
ONE WARNING THO :
---
Make sure the motherboard can handle the 3600 out of the box. I think mine can but my friend got an ASUS and we had no choice but to swap my 2600 into his, update the BIOS and swap back... this is perfectly ok to do but you will need a friend... good luck
---
It's the catpcha of course.
---
yeah, I remember the portals, just think what an eve player could do with it though
---
Or an eve player with the lock summons, Zeppelin shenanigans
---
Nostralius had like what, 12k peak in its lifetime? And IIRC that's when they were shutting down. Even then, it was alive for like a year.  There's obviously going to be more than that when it comes out, but by the time the content is dried up, there's no reason to play it anymore. Vanilla endgame was rushed and had nothing to do when you got BiS for pvp and pve. And that won't take long with how much information players have about the game today.
---
If that were the case, it'd actually be pretty smart.  It's like a casino with the moneyline.  They try to get 50% of the money on each side and their cut is the vig.  With this, if the amount of RL money you made is dependent on random chance, you try to set it up so that you have a 50/50 shot of getting any individual drop, and if they're even, you can always expect ~50% of the ISK to drop instead of 20% and 80% there, which is subject to random bad luck.
---
You clearly don't pvp
---
Consider biomassing
---
It doesn't matter if people warp to the in cyno for a JF; it just docks.  That change is more so JF pilots don't have to have a cyno chain of recon's.  Not that it wont facilitate people trying to be sneaky with a JF, it just isn't going to impact how JF ganking.
---
you clearly don't reddit

I chuckled

Trying to get world first on a raid. Two guilds are ahead of the rest.
---
*EVE* player with no life puts an alt into rival guild. Right as they're in the last phase, does a stupid thing and wipes the raid.
---
Thank you : ) Holding the cloak and thinking through things sounds better than trying to gun it right when I see the “red icons” of the enemy ships. I haven’t tried any of the warp core stabilizers either, so will look into those.
---
I was unaware of both of these (or anything that buffed alignment by taking away structure) and have not tried rigs before, so that could be an option. Thanks!
---
If you get a new mobo , you'll want to make sure it has an m.2 slot on it. Any mobo worth buying will.
---
From there you can plug a suoer fast type of ssd directly onto the board. Just make sure to buy an NMVE drive, or its a waste of time.  They are reasonably priced these days.
---
That is a very broad statement.  I think the competence of a lot of the community is phenomenal.  Certainly that has been my experience.  But I have only been in smaller corps that were quite selective, not ever in any of the big blocs.  (They all had one flaw to their competence, they all let me in.)
---
"can net you as much" does not imply an average. that implies a maximum.
---
This seems good. What is the problem?

I think he means you can be the best *pilot* at everything. He's **not** saying your *ship* can be the best at everything.

---
Ah gotcha, makes sense then.
---
To your point about skills being a limited resource; implants *partially* take up that role. 
---
Slot 6 can improve *small* turret damage (distinct implants each for energy, hybrids, and projectiles), Slot 8 improves *medium*, and Slot 10 does *large*. Missiles are Slots 9, 7, and 6 for respective sized launchers.
---
I'm gonna have to respectfully disagree with you here.  The only way it wouldn't be in someone's timezone, is if they were asleep.
---
So even though over 85% of people in the US work 9-5, you would consider an event in the timezone if it's within most of the country's work hours? I don't understand that.
---
An event is in a specific timezone if a large percentage of people in that timezone play at that time. Just because a few people would get the chance to play at a different time, that doesn't change the average player's experience.
---
Sounds like HK doesn't know how to roll a hole.

Ah, good to know you're moving over to WoW.

Good for them, though having worked with Hanzo before I can tell you he isn't a star fc either

He can always use the free corvette to do career agents. It's how I worked my way from poverty when I logged back in a couple of months back. No idea how I got that poor thou in the first place. It's been so long ago...
---
It's a change to the core gameplay so some people are going to love it and some people are going to hate it. I don't think it's gone into effect yet so we don't know how it's going to play out.
---
That's actually what we want- more people in whs
---
Nice.

Has it always been an option to copy with formatting?  I personally really liked the change, as I can easily copy a pre-prepared fleet MOTDs [with formatting] straight from the notepad into the channel setting window.  However, if it was always possible to do this via the dropdown menu then I don't mind if it gets relegated to a non-default.
---
I did a chemical yard for the first time in 0.5 and a frigate commander spawned. I got 140,000 ISK in wiring and lost a t2 drone.  The end.
---
Now you're talking. Nuet Stratios shuts the tank down really quick and then their drone damage can chew through the rest. Torpedoes are soooo slow but they do the job eventually. Even faster if you bring friends.
---
In the Eve ecosystem, I think it's more accurate (and I am splitting hairs here) to call it "Pay 2 Race Ahead". Swiping the plastic bumps you up in the race. 
---
But it doesn't stop others from catching up organically. And it doesn't stop you from tripping over your feet, or taking a wrong turn and inadvertently backtracking. 
---
And that's what makes it appealing to CCP: Injectors don't let you finish the race. 
---
It's a problem for the contestants in the race when Injectors are almost necessary to *remain* competitive.
---
No it died. First molok death in the game!!
---
Yeah but he also makes the good point about how really powerful abilities are balanced by limiting their platform (such as bubbles) and how cynos which are a very powerful ability doesn't have this check. Whether you like it or not limiting the type of ship which can light a cyno does add another strategic element to the mix and one that all groups will have to account for.
---
He means mudflation
---
Race will only determine what hull and weapon system you get trained off the bat, and what weapons and hulls you're career agents give you. Read Eve-U's articles on the main weapon systems, each race favors a different type of damage output, tanking, ewar weapons, and ship feel.
---
If you want to know about them for character development you're [going to have to read some stuff](https://community.eveonline.com/backstory/races/).
---
Poke the QFC, dont leave them room for making isk... god bless you guys
---
Yeah, I don't look at it that way.  Sure, there may be peak times through the day where more people from a given country are online, but that doesn't necessarily make an event out of someone's timezone if it falls outside those peak hours.  
---
On the subject of timezones, I think they're a stupid concept anyway.  The world should only run on one timezone--UTC.  But that's an argument for a different thread somewhere else, lol.  
---
Anyway, I appreciate your perspective on the subject, and thank you for the conversation :)  I've gotta get to work myself now... Lol.
---
I dont mind it. I always thought it was kind of stupid you could see who was in the system with you
---
Well the space telephone is powered by isogen 24? New fuel source for T Mobile space observatorys?
---
Just warp through the system from gate to gate, make sure you use the jump key or warp to zero at gate. The extra buffer will help you to survive when you decloak after jumping into a triglavian system.
---
Welcome and see the above comment
---
oof, somebody doesn't like his dirty laundry getting aired.
---
Widow will be useful again as cyno food.
---
You have to admit that's a pretty smart change
---
&gt;They need to get rid of any skills that affect the performance of a ship, weapons, mods. Everyone should just be able to fly them the same. Only thing you train for are the ships themselves.
---
Is it weird that I think the exact *opposite* is a better idea? 
---
Screw training for access to ships and modules. Train for performance of ships of ships and modules.
---
My experience with ED is that it's fun as hell to fly your ship around *doing very very little*. The flight mechanic is insanely fun with a HOTAS and I haven't tried the VR yet but the VR looks next-level. 
---
Yes, there's some basic exploration and scanning. Yes, there's aliens you can fight and some other combat opportunities. Yes, there's mining and hauling. 
---
But really there's more content in just the tutorial and newbro epic arc missions in eve online then there is in the entirety of ED. I would say there's more content in No Mans Sky then there is in ED. 
---
For immediate chair-gripping fun I would say ED wins in very limited scenarios, basically just combat, but eve online is definitely going to be more engaging long-term.
---
I wanted more answers, when doing a research project you site multiple sources not one -_-
---
That's not true, you can choose to not warp to new static and be effectively isolated
---
&gt;The proportion of people using (and losing) their supers has never been higher, precisely because of how accessible they are.
---
Yea they get ganked alot because of course, more access = more dumb people. But that also means more groups have the crushing weight of numbers of them required to deny content. Previously you had, well, NC, PL and goons, and that was about it, subcap engagements could take place pretty much anywhere those guys weren't. And after phoebe, you could even have small capital fights wherever those guys weren't. Now it's like a nuclear deterrant to content. So many groups now have a sizeable enough supercapital fleet, it will deter them getting into any engagements with an inferior enemy because there's no chance for the other side to win, because if one side starts losing they can just dump their supercaps on grid and clean up. This was always possible save for a couple years in eve's history (and even then, you could just freely dump archons on grid to clean up as long as you had enough supercaps to protect them from escalation), but the groups with the critical mass to do it were very small in number.
---
&gt;Most people saying that it's stupid supers can dock are showing their eve-age. The biggest barrier to entry for a super had nothing to do with needing a sitter or whatever. The issue most people had was that the big groups, through their dominance, controlled who had a super 
---
It really wasn't that difficult to buy one on the open market, and moving it really wasn't that hard if you weren't a complete potato. Sure building your own was scary, but plenty of people sold them, and if you were really motivated enough it was very easy to get a few alts into goons and buy some. It was a direct result of coffining a high SP alt into the ship that there were so few. Builders had to hold them if they weren't pre-sold, stockpiles were not a thing, and you didn't have humongous masses of retards flying supercapitals with 1 or 2 accounts like you have today. Rorquals and injectors are a serious contributor, of course. But you would not see nearly as many alliances capable of fielding fleets of 50-100+ titans without the addition of keepstars, even with those changes.
---
The problem is what kind of reward to you feel after 23 days of training for a 1% difference. Not much I would think. Where 23 days for a new ship, or 2 new ships you can fly a month. At least you see the reward.
---
Outstanding!
---
Move over Jump Fatigue, the new cancer to Eve is now Pod Fatigue.
---
How do you deliver exactly? Is there an option in the contract?
---
You linked a back story?
---
Ecm is still quite good in small gang especially against brawlers. Once you’re scram webbed, you can’t really burn out to the 50-100km that jam ships operate at to kill them, also few small gang ships will have this kind of projection and dps to force them off.
---
Blackbirds are especially nasty cause they can easily jam to 100km
---
It wasn't risk free, I was very close to killing a few barghest by simply predicting their orbit with a cloaked astero and warping my dps onto it. I failed by seconds. 800m that doesn't move fast is never risk free in wormholes
---
When you outtank the dps you are also in complete safety from the rats
---
How do I save docs like this to my google drive? I prefer doing it that way to using bookmarks.
---
Well there is less sand in the sandbox now so join a large group and hit f1
---
Care to let the rest of us in, since we can't do it ourselves now?
---
Do you really need cloak and tank when your ship worth peanuts and your fleet can one-volley anything on the field?
---
Definitely high-risk shenanigans!
---
Holy shit it's almost 2020
---
&gt;I noticed in Starcraft 2 you now start out with twice as many resource gathering units at the beginning of the game making the whole game faster.
---
Yeah and it's one of many reasons why SC2 will always be trash compared to BW
---
Does Atron's description still mention that it's bad for mining?
---
*Okaaaaay now*, your issue **actually** with diminishing returns. 
---
Don't train `Large Pulse Laser Specialisation V`. Just do `III` or something like reasonable people do.
---
To use Olympic Athletes as an example. They dedicate their lives to getting that 1% difference. At the very top of the highest level of performance, that 1% *matters*. 
---
But. 
---
Less than 1% of the population cares about that enough to work that hard. The reward isn't worth it. 
---
I assume you don't want to put the effort in. That's fine. But it sounds like you want be on the same level as the best... but you want to do that by preventing others from climbing ahead of you.
---
What do you want to know, your questions are very general.
---
I hate it.
---
so a static hole to cache and etherium reach?
---
Only in Upwell structures. Right Click on the object you want to Deliver. There's a `Deliver To` option in the menu. It's not reversible by the sender, so don't send it to the wrong person.
---
Good shit guys, keep it up.
---
Doubt you can hold it, but still an achievement.
---
No webbers  were involved in the movement of these assets either
---
For real? How in the hell are you supposed to get anything in position and how are you going to haul anything from nullsec? What the fuck?
---
I fc'd a fleet where we killed the same fleet like 2 weeks ago
---
Not a lot of DPS at 400k+
---
Out of range
---
Snuffed / PL isn’t blue to TNT I don’t believe
---
Now that's an old meme.
---
So old it almost feels wrong now.
---
Super Blobs can now cyno off-grid and actually warp into a fight. 
---
All it takes is three minutes...
---
Hey dude, if you got 1.4B just lying around feel free to send it to toon AssetHang, I’ll spent it all over the galaxy.
---
Jump Freighters can now jump to covert cynos which can be lit on all the same hulls as before.
---
&gt; Skill hardly mattered you just drowned the bosses in bodies and they would eventually die.
---
Imagine that, actually relying on the strength of your character rather than on you personally playing Dance Dance Revolution with red floor.
---
What is this, an RPG?
---
&gt; I would love to have constant access to thera in delve.
---
Probably more the case that the WoW audience was more like the fortnite audience today back then.
---
I do use probes from time to time but I didn't saw them saw them warp off while scanning them
---
Yes
---
Retarded idea... We dont pay for this game to wait 30 minuts to respawn or u want more risk awerse players.
---
If u have more of this in your pocket pls change game we dont need you here.
---
Sure he would. Nothing pays him more than corps and alliances donating IDK to his cause.
---
ASK Horde about that. They are in the drone regions
---
I have 3 accounts, 3 main chars one over 120m SP, one over 100m and the other on about 75Msp .  I look at the time it took to get there and they realise it's such a disincentive to new players. Also I think you equade effort with time. SP has nothing to do with effort, in fact getting it is effortless( I liked that about eve). 
---
If no one cares about 1% then remove it. Make the focus on player  skill. If being the Best is the guy who played the longest well then it's not about skill really is it? 
---
Sometimes I just wish the Vets of eve would get off their high SP horse and realize so much about this game it not difficult for depth just difficulty for the sake of consuming time it. 
---
Eve will make more money off enguaged players then guys that take 3-4 years to get their SP anywhere near average players.
---
I just returned to EVE and brought a few friends with me who are also going to be playing classic. Add me as a friend if you want to explore in spaceships and play wizards!
---
#Amarr:
---
Religious Zealots, ruled by an Empress (who may or may not be a capsuleer, even though the Empress is supposed to be a mortal human.
---
They fly shiny armor ships, which are mostly slower and shoot lasers (though there are some drone and missile boats and some ships that do great shield).
---
#Caldari
---
Crony-Capitalism on steroids. They are a consortium of super corporations that rule instead of a real government.
---
They generally fly shield ships that tend to be slightly faster, and they are well known for using missiles, also have lots of ships that use railguns and blasters.
---
#Gallente
---
They love porn, and prostitutes, and drugs, and FREEDOM!!!! Liberal democracy gone very far. They also control the Caldari homeworld (Gallente Prime and Caldari Prime are in the same system). The Caldari hate the Gallente for this and once put a titan over Gallente prime, threathening to doomsday the planet.
---
They are well known for armor and drones, but also have blaster/railgun ships. A few ships even work well shielded.
---
Holy extra chromosomes batman. Is this a requirement to get into GOTG?
---
Throw out brisc?
---
Minmatar?
---
Love your videos, keep up the good work on the content!
---
still require a barghest or something and that cost quite a lot
---
Oh upwell structures, make sense! Thanks.
---
Triglavian invasions pushing people out of Hisec, blackout pushing people out of nullsec.
---
CCP confirmed making lowsec great again.
---
or wormholes
---
I am actually sure it is a destroyer spawn, which makes no difference in terms of what it could drop (it would still be only an astero), but yes what you experienced happens basically most of the time, that the drop is not super awesome. 
---
It can have some nice things, but it won't have that all the time, otherwise astero prices would probably range around 10M ISK or so :D
---
You just have to keep doing it ... over the time you will have good drops here and there and it adds up :)
---
Besides with possible escalations, you can keep it going for a little longer :)
---
Yesterday i was flying around in my raven with frigate scouting ahead (to know exactly what i am going to get in),  saw solo leshak two systems ahead on the gate to Vlillirier (i was 2 jumps away with raven and my alt was watching leshak from a spot)  and decided to see how long my raven lasts is going to last against him.  
---
I set my course for this lonely lesh (hoping that he has little or no friends that will turn my ship into another zkillboard record in 5 seconds) and almost took a gate to Vlillirier as my 2nd acc sees second leshak warped to first one and attempted to bait aggro. First took the gate while second never followed him and after 5 minutes first one jumps back to commence aggressive negotiations with the second one (i guess he was bored too).  
---
\*\*10-20 seconds into their fight\*\*  
---
Second leshak activates cyno and his friends in Erebus and Rorqual jump and in and proceed to kill this guy and here is killmail: [https://zkillboard.com/kill/78551906/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78551906/) 
---
On top of being a coward, someone dediced to drop a titan + rorqual to kill a lonely guy in lowsec... speaking of being risk averse!
---
They are too awesome to be described. The only one race that use firearm guns on their SPACESHIPS. Love them
---
Not necessarily claiming it's a problem, but currently a cyno can be fit and lit by literally any ship that isn't a shuttle. That means capital ships that are grinding ISK, so they can call a capital fleet to sit on anybody who attacks them. Even the free rookie ship can fit one, which means that alt accounts for pure cyno toons are quick, cheap and easy to set up, and the whole setup is cheap enough that it's expendable. (light cyno on low sec station, jump carrier in, shoot station, station kindly turns off your cyno for you, dock up, switch alts, repeat) 
---
This change will remove both of those options, and more or less force ratters to have an alt in a cloaked recon sitting with them, and will make alts for the moving of ships around, a lot more expensive. Several hundred times more expensive.
---
You have serious mental issues, I suggest you seek help
---
TY MR BLIGHT :D
---
Tbh Vanilla WoW wasn't the best IMO. Between rep grinds, rank grinds, attune grinds and 4-5 hours long 5 ppl dungeons, it was certainly not for everyone.
---
its in the vid you degenerate
---
mining barges now all fit scrams and form a scram chain at the start of every mining op    
---
occasionally some people mess up (corp w/o friendly fire, out of corp alts not initiating duel, etc) and get concorded
---
&gt; the game starts at level 1
---
it really doesn't. it starts at 60, and everything before that is just a time sink before you start begging people to boost you through attunement runs so you can access the only worth while content the game has.
---
&gt; So this is a genuine question but do you never play any other old games?
---
not for more than a day or two - that's roughly how long it takes to realise why i moved on from them to begin with.
---
Did you even read the 2nd line of the post?
---
The 3rd line is the more retarded one. Makes booshing completely useless in HS.
---
Lold
---
Lol, so russians are already splitting up again? Well, that didnt take long...
---
You got me. It's late at night and I read it as "Mining ships are now booshing in Highsec."
---
AAA Mk...15 or whatever when? Catch looks awfully disused atm.
---
And what about elite c4 corporations?
---
I like how you didn't say any of it was untrue
---
Booshing should be mostly used against war targets , not to grief random people.
---
Like I said, I don't consider an event in someone's timezone if most people in that timezone can't play. It's an event for another time zone that you happen to be able to participate in.
---
People work at all times of the day, so aren't all events technically for all time zones? Why does it matter when most people sleep, if it doesn't matter when most people work?
---
Yea you're effectively isolated if you ignore one of the major strategies used to find content, which is rage rolling your static.
---
How would these changes implode highsec wardec alliances?
---
Cant sit on gates in perfect safety in overly blinged shit anymore.
---
Get into your X doctrine copied directly from LZHX or HK or ehefkae
---
Sit on the undock with your 6 other corp mates 
---
Talk about how many dreads and faxes you need to build to make your home unassailable 
---
Scout down the chain says you're connected to "insert c5 pvp corp"
---
Dock back up until they go away
---
Ask why literally everyone else in J space laughs at you
---
Log off
---
Go play Tarkov
---
Tell me more how specs that dont work and pve that doesnt require a brain were better than todays
---
But if booshing makes you go suspect it won't be used against war targets either.
---
Who?
---
Snuff shouldn't retreated back then.
---
Everyone missed a chance to see a laaaarger CCP Fleet.
---
What site are you using to view prices from that long ago?
---
When people don´t understand the difference between a game that started 15 years ago and have been updated constantly and a game that didn´t get an update for 15 years...
---
It should be giving you enough isk to do it.
---
Part of that is it teaching you how to buy skils.
---
500,000isk is basically nothing.
---
What makes wormhole relic sites valuable is the loot from the sleeper.
---
na... idea daid no mass limit :-)
---
Well, sometimes people come in and buy so many that it wipes out multiple orders at once.
---
Like just before the cyno changes were announced, someone bought every single Panther in the Forge, regardless of the price. Same with sell orders.
---
So you don't have to always be the best order, otherwise we'd see every single item be at .01isk difference between buy and sell orders.
---
This is amazing news, glad we've been heard!!
---
It still hurts to lose a blue.
---
Logged in because I didn't believe you.  
---
&gt;The Atron is a hard nugget with an advanced power conduit system, but little space for cargo. **Although it is a good harvester when it comes to mining**, its main ability is as a combat vessel.
---
Holy shit.
---
That's not his question.
---
He means, if a bonus is 10% and another bonus is 5%, does that mean a 15% bonus or a 15.5% bonus?
---
Almost all are multiplicative.
---
Normally from highest down, with modules affecting the same state having diminishing returns EXCEPT for Rigs.
---
But anyway, at max skills, I believe a Gila drones damage modifier is like 37x
---
I personally would choose gallente. My reasons:
---
1) No matter what you do you will probably do some PVE to make isk from time to time. Gallente typically has great ships for PVE because of drones, especially at lower levels. Including the Tristan which is a great first ratting ship you could use almost immediately.
---
2) Gallente has the biggest diversity of T1 industrial ships. Specialized for PI products, or minerals, etc. So starting off with Gallente Industrial I is nice head start.
---
******
---
Reason to choose Caldari: The main trade hub in the game is Jita. If your character will focus on industry or mining or station trading etc maybe it’s convenient to start off the game in jita instead of having to make a trip there.
---
Reason to choose Minmatar: In Rust We Trust. Meme points. Maybe if your going to make ammo starting out the have a T1 hauler with ammo hold.
---
Reason to Choose Amarr: A lot of PVP doctrines seem to favor Amarr (also minmatar). So maybe you’ll save some time on your pvp train. 
---
****
---
Disclaimer: This question of what to pick first is basically just a: what lore do you like or what Faction Warfare side do you want to join. Otherwise everything above is only a time savings of less than an hour for each head start and mostly insignificant isk.
---
Depends on sec status, in a 0.2 low sec system the payout is 17700 per mission. In 0.5 it is 14000. Null in the 25k area. 10 missions per hour is realistic.
---
Please for the love of god put militia above criminal/suspect/permaflashy
---
Can you tell me more about minmitar and amarr please
---
Because reddit is mainly filled with Legacy and Imperium members, who are both on the same side
---
Winterco is Mainly CHTZ and don't use reddit  
---
Test also spam the fuck out of anything when they get a chance  
---
alsoDredditiscrecruiting
---
Check the redeem items window. Ask in the Rookie Help chat if you can't find it, someone there will know where to find it, or they'll just toss you the isk
---
Too much complaining, not enough goon killing.
---
Actually SibSquad were'nt in Russian coalition
---
RIP.  
---
 
---
paid about 1.1 for that shield booster as well.   
---
   
---
Enjoy the loot.  
---
I got seriously punished for flying very sloppy.  Drifted too close to the sleip we had tackled. Knew he had skirm links running.    
---
He did a good job of baiting it though, waited for the other ships to be in position, then lunged for the scram and I was too slow/too close to react in time.  
---
Bhall mjd'd ontop of me and capped me right after.  
---
GF.
---
Abandon all your plans and jump into a nulsec Corp.  Plenty out there that take new players.
---
Brave Newbies for example. (plenty out there but shameless plug)
---
You will learn a lot more out there, they give yiu free ships, you can participate in fleets and there is plenty of isk to be made along with skill plans to get you flying what you want to fly.
---
QFC is largely dead... [TCP](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/The_CareBear_PirateShip) died with a whimper, [SMA](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/SpaceMonkey's_Alliance) got bashed by NullSechnaya so hard they live in a wh now, [FATAL](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/FATAL_ORDER) folded, [Divinity](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/Divinity.) left for greener pastures, only [Hivemind](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/The_Hivemind_Federation_Alliance) has some vestigial presence left. 
---
On the bright side our old frenemies SR moved back in.
---
There is still Init in their krabbing pocket but we don't bridge there, tis a silly place.
---
The nergal won't ever beat the daredevil on the dramiel.
---
Yeah, I was wrong, guess it's *good* for mining!
---
If you crit every hole into your system you can easily run sites worry free basically afk unless a fleet wants to try all jump in on the same tick and risk being stuck/half a fleet lol.
---
speaking of dead things, isn't your corp kinda dead now?
---
Special type of level 4 mission with hull restrictions depending on the type of burner. They give great payouts for the time it takes to run a lot of them. 
---
Basically a fitting and skill requirement check. If you can get very efficient at running them, especially in null, it’s one of the better isk making activities in the game. 
---
They are very difficult if you go in without knowing what you’re doing or how to run them.
---
Then that peshak has a maulus friend so you get damped.
---
You can jam the maulus as much as you like he can still damp you at any time and break your lock.
---
Damps renders ecm completely useless.
---
Until you remember damps exist and perform better in every single aspect when compared to ecm.
---
It's for those times when the two surrounding regions are dead, noone probed any wormholes and you just took your stimulants.
---
Get damped. You can't so anything.
---
Burning crusade was Vanilla perfected but classic will be great
---
It's getting more and more stupid. Game have huge economic trouble and if CCP won't do anything it can be really really bad.
---
We just need to have hope for better days in EVE :)
---
It was, it still is but only if the enemy has no range damps on field.
---
A single maulus locks out any ecm ship. Even if you lock first and apply a jam you still get damped meaning you can't jam out dps, logi or other ewar ships.
---
CCP Please make that skin available would look way cool also an Avitar moves way slower than that the little guys need to get bumping.
---
 `Yeah well... Ganking mechanics have traditionally made this hard to enforce. I'm surprised there hasn't been changes to make criminal corps not able to anchor stations in highsec though.` 
---
A better approach is to make -10's unable to dock in NPC stations thus forcing them to use player owned structures and creating content by either destroying their structures or by forcing owners to stop them from docking.
---
Not even slightly. Train into gallente instead.
---
Vs logi you can reduce range forcing them closer to the main fleet or not healing or you can increase lock time giving your fleet more chance to break the tanks.
---
Enemy using ecm?... Apply a damp to ecm ship. Doesn't matter if he jams you first you can still remove them from the fight with range damps.
---
Ecm is only useful if your enemy don't have range damps and from what I've seen every fleet and small gang brings range damps with them now.
---
Until you realize the enemy has a single damp on field and that it shuts yiu down completely even if you jam it.
---
I think  extractors are sold by players, from their own skills. So people could sell more injectors.  Would probably just balance out.
---
Get damped and become useless.
---
If you look up pedantic in the dictionary it just says /u/mjedmazga
---
Damps you at 150km.
---
because noone cares about Feythabolis...
---
CCP might aswell just delete the region
---
I often just stop and admire the scenery. I also love the way everything moves while your warping and your ships shadow from the sun is changing. Can't deny even after all these years Eve is one of the best looking games. The scenery, animations, and explosions are all amazing.     
---
Considering the games age makes it even cooler.

Are you saying that Falcon doesn't know what tf he is talking about when he concocted this idea?

Cut out spaceship command entirely.
---
Instead just have the skills you need for say, REcon Ships, unlocks recon ships with no recon ship skill.
---
Maybe leave in a general skill of just Frigate, Destroyer, etc, but none of the t2 skills or racial segregation.
---
But also how it is now isn't that bad.
---
This isn't shitposting. This is badposting, as you can clearly see from the karma you got here.
---
Clearly no one knows that people in Iceland like to use these nice summer months to vacation and escape their dark [Hell hole](https://youtu.be/q5q77MQzU2Q) they live in the rest of the year.
---
&gt;What the fuck is a pve shit doing taking bait for a fight? That is hilariously silly.
---
It's exploration, astero vs explorers. You're doing pve okay but are you going to leave the site when you can fight it off and get the loot yourself? If you get in a brawl in the wrong spot, you get escalated directly and it kinda sucks.
---
you phrased something incorrectly, i pointed it out, and you for some reason cannot accept you made a mistake
---
chill out dude
---
&gt; realise it's such a disincentive to new players
---
You don't need 75m sp though to be effective in anything.
---
You can be beyond effective at the thing you want to do with less than 20m.
---
I have a "main" character with only 15m sp and she flies a near perfect HML Tengu. That's what I need her for.
---
Having a whole bunch of skills that don't affect her tengu is wasted SP.
---
But it's also just a problem that isn't solved.
---
The baseline we have now is already FASTER and with more starting SP than it was before.
---
So where does that eventually lead?
---
All skills train instantly?
---
At what point is it "fast enough"?
---
They were, or at least Fire leader said they were, although they did not participate much
---
It also is under a false argument that faster is better.
---
Some people like the slow crawl game because it's more tactical and less strategic.
---
\&gt; when winterco starts winning fight and pop test ihubs in feythabolis  
---
Probably because there was no Winter 'win'. The four ihubs which died were replaced by Legacy/Razor and the *one* TCU that FRT emplaced was taken back by Legacy so Winter &amp; Friends made zero progress despite the forty timers.

Elite Dangerous does what it does well. And after you've seen all 2 hours of content there is no point playing it again.
---
Reee
---
&gt;It is public knowledge that many of the bots have moved to FW or hisec since blackout. Looks like more alfa accounts weren't enough for them.

Speaking of citing your sources...citation needed.  And it's spelled "alpha", not alfa oh master-of-pulling-claims-out-of-your-ass.

Hey, I heard there will be a summit soon...you been practicing your coffee making skills bro?  And speaking of rational discussion regarding changes...how does it feel to be dancing around your campaign promises while pretending to have "insider" knowledge.  Yeah, bro, I got my eye real close on you...watch your step...nahnahnah nah, nahnahnah nah, hey, heey...gooood bye.

bro 😎💪
---
Where did I say there should be only one playstyle? Reading comprehesion is hard for many apparently. I just said that PVP is better for the game than PVE. The more stuff explodes the more you earn isk doing PVE. If every player did both PVE and PVP then game would be a lot more fun for everyone.
---
I like schemes and planning too.. But if you're giving no chances to your enemies, they could be npc at that point. And you're farming them, just like the vexor farming rats next door except you're schemes are more complex (or maybe not, gate camping is almost the most profitable and it's a reaction game thing)
---
getting flair bated by moose is a national pasttime
---
You do know Elite originally came out 1983-1984 originally right? (BBC Micro - C64 etc)
---
As much as I think Elite is a boring game - It isn't an Eve wannabe.
---
Yeah 2 players strat are already way more fun. Eve has one aspect is that you get way more power(however you define it)/isk and power/sp with more players. You're going to need quite a bit of SP to beat the loki alone.
---
Get cheap ships, get them destroyed and learn how other player fly. Then you'll find weaknesses you can exploit. Look up their zkill, look up loki losses in general. And then kill that loki!
---
But I'm saying, a strategy with multiple player (even just two) becomes way easier.
---
Incursions are amazing. Buy a machariel and you will easily plex
---
Yeah your setup is quite expensive. 6chars, you could have dreads at some point!
---
Acceptance: this will be good for content.
---
Use neutral bumping ships to bump of war afk war targets from their jita staging.

Last time i bumped one of the blink lokis 350km away before he noticed.

You've never been on an enyo fleet if you think crit holes matter

What's a wormhole
---
No one says NS should be like WH.....
---
Just NS could use some actual risk.
---
Dont want cynos? Great! There are none.
---
Also yup totally no cynos!
---
I need a bigger isk war chest then and a crystal ball for future market trends! Thank you for the reply.
---
 Basically, why should NS stay more like lowsec if it can be more like WH space?
---
OK any when you want to fly another ship, but need 4 x the SP of the ship itself to use guns, armor tank etc.. then what ? Start a different character so you don't waste SP. See how silly SP to play the game starts to look.  It is hindering the enjoyment of the game to force a minimum time to use it.
---
Ah yeah to be honest I have not played in wormholes since pre AF buff.
---
Trading is only really profitable for large traders, because the throughput of isk has to be really really high.
---
It is often just not worth it for small scale traders.
---
I think that is where my product choice needs refining.  I was looking for high volume number of transaction, with a high total value of isk spent.  Clearly that is where the 'active, marketeers are!
---
People ram kikis and enyos through crit holes all the time. 
---
There's actually a video of MCAV taking 2 fleets out of our already massed static. Chain crits, so we aren't done and take out enyos, most of us die to their BCs but we force most of their fleet through their also crit hole, theirs closes, so while they're trying to leave we bring more enyos out of our hole to finish them off.
---
Well if its not big deal and a hindrance to the 99% that do not use it, why leave it for the remaining 1%. Just flatten the SP or remove the insane requirements instead. So many other things to do then just that.
---
Because msot people aren't flying a bunch of totally different ships.
---
People specialize.
---
They fly Amarr ships. So they end up with loads of transferrable skills.
---
They don't NEED to be able to fly this specific gallente ship with drone, this amarr neut laser ship, this caldari ecm missile ship, and this minamattar fax.
---
Being able to do EVERYTHING should take time.
---
But people don't NEED to be able to do that.
---
&gt; force a minimum time to use it.

Enter: Skill Injectors.

[Stubbornness and autism](https://www.autismfamilypower.com/stubborn-or-inflexible-high-functioning-autism/)

better get yourself checked before you wreck yourself
---
i never said i was wrong, i just said you're autistic about it.
---
I understand that, buy generally you designee a game to encourage engagement , rather then make thing take exponential longer for the sake of gating it.
---
NS should be more dangerous for sure so that's awesome updates. But except of high risc NS should have a high profit. For now NS is quite empty cous u have no reason to take this riscs while u can make a way more profit in WH or even HS
---
Let us boosh away those augmented mining drones.
---
Want people to endure that risk?
---
Make it worth their while.
---
Why not? We already have noble gasses &gt; oxygen which is alchemy enough for me.
---
Ever play a car racing game ? How many cars you collect and try in the game. 
---
If you think good game design is having 300+ ships and saying players only use 1 or 2 I think you just arguing for the sake of making your point.  
---
&gt; Being able to do EVERYTHING should take time. 
---
It will take time to learn the ship, not 60 years to be able to do everything. Or 7k in skill injectors for a full ability character.
---
How many % of the total ISK and Minerals generated are in NS? like 80%?
---
And you talk about worth the while lmfao
---
Also you're rarely actually zoomed in on the action, so the graphics (while still really good) arent necessary for enjoyment as the mechanics are really solid
---
&gt;Make it worth their while.
---
Like, if you own SOV for a certain time you get a special ship skin?
---
Honestly my idea is that nullsec itself should be more diverse.     
---
Aka regional effects that change how stuff works in specific area.          
---
I am talking about stuff like :          
---
* No cynos      
---
* Gates not letting you use capitals      
---
* Difference in shield armor usability ^(aka -40% of shield EHP due to local phenomena)               
---
Current CCP actions are bad as they make eve more and more flat instead of more and more diverse.          
---
Those are also 'no work' changes aka database 1/0 changes ....
---
Are alpha clones accepted to incursion parties? I mean with alpha skill limits.
---
Just declare war on them if you want to fight them? Don't want to pay the War cost? Just Carry a bunch of bling in a Freighter through the Perimeter gate and make sure they see you and you'll have your war within the week.
---
Because WH space is boring and require constant scanning?       
---
If people wanted to live in such space WH space would not be so empty like it is now ?                
---
Unless you consider this farming alts scattered across WH as a population.             
---
I personalty know a guy with 12 private holes ^(thank you extractors)
---
This is Lussy Lou alt. They probably knew it and decided to bait him. That lonely guy in lowsec has a gnosis tackle/scout and very dangerous
---
Do you need much more scanning in NS with the recent changes?
---
False. The OP has found sites where the primary reward is in the "blue loot" from the enemies. The relic cans in C5 space add a significant marginal reward, but they aren't a big dice roll and you won't ever strike it rich off of them. On top of that, the items have large buy/sell gaps even in Jita and move slowly on the market.
---
I never see this, cause my screen is covered by tables, they removed chat window so i can see little more.
---
This guy skipped the EVE tutorial where you learn to fit module to your ship.
---
Sure, that's why every modern game comes with every weapon, character and level unlocked, right?
---
You can load into Skyrim and use all the spells and weapons and armor right away.
---
Well Hierarchy takes a bit longer.
---
I'd say Independence around 7min.
---
Radiance is around 10min.
---
Hierarchy will def take you 15min, as you HAVE clear first room at least the two main groups, you cannot blitz it. and you have to trigger multiple spawns in the 2nd pocket and the last rigger for the sentient spawn needs to have all former 3 battleships killed. Besides if you really only trigger everything without cleaning up at least something, you face alot of DPS, that could get you in trouble.
---
If you are targeting escalations, Radiance is the way to go if you wanna speed it up. The Independence escalation can be tricky if they suddenly end, as they won't give you a different information, but you have to check the site for yourself if it's the one with sentient spawn or not. So Independence is more the site itself that you wanna do, but you leave the escalations.
---
And Hierarchy is basically good escalation, but the site as described above takes a moment. :)
---
&gt; players only use 1 or 2 
---
Hardly.
---
Many many many ships use the same skills. Even sticking to just a few hulls will put you in a position to fly many more at comparable levels.
---
But broad scale diversification takes some time.
---
Even in your car racing game analogy, you can't immediately buy every car.
---
&gt; That's a bit of a shit introduction to the game dont you think ?
---
That's RPGs. And anything with unlockables.
---
If I've played Battlefrield 2 years longer than you, I will have more stuff, and until I have EVERYTHING, I'll continue to get more ahead of you in unlocking stuff than you will.
---
Did you ever read any kind of eve related reports where most iskies in eve are getting printed??? .... do it and come back again!
---
Of course under cyno-umbrella and with bots or guys with 30 accounts mining every rock out of space :-)
---
You should check wh page on zkb once in a while before stating, that there is no life in wh
---
delete c4 space
---
The four major empires should only be connected via low sec routes. Also CCP should have one NPC station in each empire region where if  your NPC faction ratings are high enough you can trade with zero tax costs to help promote new regional trade hubs instead of everybody congregating on Jita/Parimeter.
---
I'm pretty sure they're stretched kinda thin and EU is by far the largest time zone so...
---
Please, explain like I'm a five year old how it's a *hindrance* to people? Give specific examples. You're making it out like the last level of a `x Specialization` skill is a requirement for things.

As someone who has a high-sec mining alt, I can assure you that anyone with a barge and access to spodumain, null ice, and null moons will make more per hour than the alt makes with veldspar, moons that never have anything better than arkonor, and crappy ice. That's why I generally don't do much more than park it on a big rock and let my drones fill it up while I roam low or something.
---
I get that, but I'm looking for somewhere that has fit advice and build suggestions. Coming across wildly different builds in the past has been very inspiring.
---
Ah brilliant! I'd just recently found this actually so it's good to hear it's known!
---
I'll check that too, cheers!
---
Classic
---
Calm down. Just stockpile Isogen until it can be enriched to Isogen5 and used for a Jovian weapon of mass destruction.
---
No to the tax changes.  
---
It’s one of the major isk sinks in eve to help balance out the economy.
---
&gt;Ever play a car racing game ? How many cars you collect and try in the game.
---
Do you collect ships in Eve like cars in a racing game?
---
&gt; If you think good game design is having 300+ ships and saying players  only use 1 or 2 I think you just arguing for the sake of making your  point. 
---
You need to check that self-centred attitude. Just because *you* only use one/two ships (or your alliance only has one/two doctrines), doesn't mean every other player does the same thing as you. The other people can -- and do -- train into whatever the hell they want. 
---
So those 300+ ships *are* being used. Just not by you. 
---
Do you think it's good 'car design' when Ford makes vans, trucks, SUVs, sedans, and hatchbacks?
---
They aren't even worth 5-6b each realistically lol, that's the zkillboard inflated price for the novelty items. The only real drops were skins and plex and plenty of that stuff got taken by random neutrals
---
Here's an F for respect...
---
However not an impressive killmail as it's more of a gank than a pvp kill.
---
You'll get em next time!!
---
I don't say that there is no life in WH i only state that population is much smaller than in K space.           
---
I don't think we have more WH people ^(real people) than number of WH systems exist.
---
if i light a cybosaural field will it allow sperglords to jump to conclusions?
---
Yes.       
---
Sorry but flying in cloacked ship and constantly probe is not fun for me.              
---
I prefer to go on enemy with blasters at 0 instead of kite them.         
---
You had whole FW for this kind of kiting game play .
---
You definitely can, it was the only way I could keep my ship hangar manageable before I started using extra cap hulls as station containers
---
thats how i maintain the junk in my hangers. just deliver the stuff i have no immediate use to myself. but it becomes a piss pain if you live in a wh.
---
Cool fights.. Now I want to train minmatar cruisers again aaah..
---
Good riddance!
---
Very cool to hear it! Have a nice day! :)
---
Why do you need constant scanning in NS nowdays?
---
I also don't like to fly cloacked ships, and I rarely scan. What does kiting gameplay have to do with cynos and blackout?
---
you cant roll a NS static into HS.
---
\&gt;  you cant roll a NS static into HS. 
---
I said null sec gate as in system, not NS statics. 
---
Discussion is a comparison between null sec gates/systems, and null cannot be re-routed. The risk is more compared to a WH carebear that can shutdown busy holes.
---
I dont care so much about cyno changes but for leaving free intell on world map and removing local chat i'd say goodby sub monies.
---
Plex prices are going up, ISK income is droping, market is struggling with more bots and less items. 
---
CCP is telling us statistics are good? **If a man walks with a dog, they statistically have 3 legs.**
---
Found a good solution: [https://www.wowclassiccountdown.com/](https://www.wowclassiccountdown.com/)  2 games in one subscription.
---
Yup the direction the games taking is extremely sad
---
Thets true, but someone cant magically have a gate appear into your NS either. That happens in wormholes.
---
You're literally a goon linemember bro
---
ahhh delve, a place for braindead krabs to live among their own
---
It is worth while under your umbrella.
---
Log in 5 alts,  restart tutorial. Undock 5 alts. While warping log next 5 in. Lock rat cycle civilian gun then restart next 5 tutorials. Undock those, dock the first 5 and repeat.
---
Was grinding 24 sets of sprees in 40 minutes.
---
&gt;but someone cant magically have a gate appear into your NS either
---
Huh? WHs appear in null.
---
So yes they do magically appear and yes, there's more risk because there's static routes that cannot be hole controlled.
---
More so what does kiting gameplay have to do with fw? Most pilots fly comets or high dps destroyers which sit at 0 on the beacon.

---
Ns generates about double what whs do, atleast in the last month. And how many more players are in null then there are in whs again?
---
Now ore https://webimg.ccpgamescdn.com/7lhcm73ukv5p/3fHgvHNuatbJnxkfRglu9n/4fbc5797d8de59ea6a7fe7371d797b80/3_mining.value.by.region_bar.png
---
Plummeted also, and we dont even have wh stats (but tbf mining in whs is rare from what i can gather)
---
The argument that ns generates so much more than wh is factually wrong, in total yes but per player im quite sure the numbers are more even if not actually in whs favor.
---
Ofc a metric i would love to know is a isk lost per player in whs and null on averagw but idk where to get that from.
---
&gt; But also how it is now isn't that bad. 
---
There definitely could be worse than what we have currently. 
---
However, I didn't consider your way of looking at it. I was thinking of something different entirely: hypothetically, I can sit in a Pilgrim without the skills. But I get no ship-bonuses unless I train `Amarr Cruiser` and `Recon Ships`. And I can't train those unless I meet their respective pre-reqs. Likewise, the 1600mm plate I fit will work, but I get no improvement to it unless I train its pre-reqs too. 
---
The big consequence of this is that the skills for modules like a 1600mm plate need to be re-worked to be more like the skills for EANMs and weapons: where there is a definite improvement to the performance of the module when you train the skill.
---
&gt;If I've played Battlefrield 2 years longer than you, I will have more stuff, and until I have EVERYTHING, I'll continue to get more ahead of you in unlocking stuff than you will.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Even in your car racing game, If I've played Forca 2 months longer than you, I will ALWAYS have more cars than you as long as we are playing.
---
A better counter example against him would be;
---
&gt;'I've been in the workforce longer than you. You can do everything I do, but you'll never really catch up.'
---
NS just really isnt more risky than wormholes.
---
If you're farming wormholes, the price of a barghest is nothing.
---
&gt; From my null bear perspective CCP is doing recently a lot of bad changes
---
Good.
---
Aw I was expecting some outplay based on cyno inhib spam or something, a direct attack under the umbrella. It's fine too! Hope we get fun stuff with the cyno changes
---
&gt; If a man walks with a dog, they statistically have 3 legs.
---
wait what
---
&gt;Lol baited
---
Ahh, the ol' [I was only pretending to be retarded](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-was-only-pretending-to-be-retarded) strategy.
---
\&gt; Me:  Discussion is a comparison between null sec gates/systems, and null cannot be re-routed. The risk is more compared to a WH carebear that can shutdown busy holes. 
---
\&gt; You:  "Thets true" 
---
\&gt; You: "but someone cant magically have a gate appear into your NS either."
---
\&gt; Me:  WHs appear in null. 
---
\&gt; You:  "NS just really isnt more risky than wormholes."   
---
Am I missing something? You have more risk control in WHs, this you agreed to, after pointing out the incorrect statement that WHs can't "magically" appear in NS, you revert back to a generic statement.
---
That looks amazing. Thank you for this new wallpaper :)
---
Not in every case, please stop being that bad.
---
Totally missing the point, by miles.
---
...
---
You missed my point.The ships designs might look ‘realistics’. But thinks like shield / armor / cap logi effects, neuts / nos, fleets boosts etcetc all look like wizzards in space
---
Can we ask for feedback in test servers before its implemented?  This has been painful.
---
Sure, basically that this isn't remotely unique to EVE and is a major part of all gaming.
---
Give it to me and my alliance of at least 2 alts then! It’s not like TETS wouldn’t blue me anyways.
---
So?
---
you are aware of the fact windows keeps ram reserved for certain things if enough is available right?
---
So more like the Rig skill changes?
---
Do you know why? Finally decided to leave the dumpster up north?
---
We gated titans, yep ;)
---
If you're really a "wormhole person" and you don't have 1.4B laying around, you're doing it wrong.
---
its how they're implemented that irks me, the big blocs didnt need a  buff to their risk averse &amp; unassailable wealth by design w/ hisec hub taxing
---
and dont at me saying "hurr durr just kill the keepstar" when 3/4 of the relevant nullsec blocs agreed to not attack eachother and share the profits
---
2 legs + 4 legs = 6 legs in total.        
---
so 6/2 = 3
---
Well player owned stations already damaged that isk sink so I don’t see how having a few NPC ultra low tax stations will make much difference on that front.
---
&gt;Ns generates about double what whs do
---
What part of the graph shows that? Commodity?
---
Commodity NPC Market. As blue loot is sold to npcs to generate isk.
---
I agreed that you can spend time to lower some risks in wormholes, much like you can in null, null has the advantage that by far the most enemies will appear through known gates that can be kept watch of. Its a lot harder to have an intel network covering a chain of wormholes that are constantly shifting.
---
im aware of what 37% means. no bloody clue how what your talking about affects whats shown.
---
i have 32GB ram, when 15.5GB is used, it shows 50% used.
---
i have windows too. whats your point?
---
Ram use at 37% when your using at best 3GB. doing rough mathematics would be 50% at 4GB. and 100% at 8GB
---
this rig has 8GB.  guess maybe you have 16GB installed incorrectly so it thinks it has 8? i dunno.
---
They increased the tax on those too
---
So....I recently had to go into hospital for over a week for some pretty serious stuff, when i got released, this had been delivered to me.
---
Just want to say amongst all the salt and bullcrap, we have one of the best communities out there and my corpies are particularly awesome.
---
Fly safe all, and have fun :)
---
&gt; through known gates that can be kept watch of.
---
I don't think so. 
---
There's much more 'magic gates' in null, such as cynos that have been the reason for the most expensive battles and loss of assets in EVE.
---
&gt; You just castrated possibility of any capital baiting and capital escalation leading to huge brawl.
---
Only if you're an idiot that doesn't know how to cloak a recon.
---
As a science fiction nerd a fairytale forest with hobbits and elves is no alternative ...

Thank you so much for saying it. It is very soothing to hear it, I mean that. 
---
Ideally we would really (and I mean like REALLY) would like to have tools that would help us dealing with the lost stuff and items on our own. It's not because we don't want to reach to you guys, no-no, it's just easier to control it, when you know what exact processes involved in a decision and in, well, restoration. And if the human error happens (wrong amount of money, wrong transfer, wrong contract, you name it), noone is affected by it and it's easier to fix.
---
We are very lucky to have amazing programmers and specialists, who help us with great tools, and this is not just a boast or words, nope. As a person who deal with hacked accounts on a daily basis, I can tell you, that there is a tremendous difference between... let's say today and a year ago. And some new gadgets are always in development as well :)
---
Certainly is the most effective counter to ECM that, though in a few situations damps won't help in a fleet fight as everything's too close together
---
&gt; one NPC station
---
Why?
---
Only the broker fee goes to the market owners.
---
Nah it wouldn't make sense for them to be unable to dock in any NPC station. The pirate factions should still be cool with them along with a load of the independent NPC corps. Empire stations sure. 
---
And they need to be blown up? Nah. I don't have anything against CODE.
---
No it was not under the umbrella.. Try again.
---
But what if I want all those things in moderation with decent play and counterplay?
---
You're the one lacking basic social awareness since they needed to explain their simple point.
---
lol
---
But it's not the only commodity.
---
There's also Inertial Stabilisers but they increase your signature radius so the trigs will lock your ship faster using that. As such I'd recommend it only if using a ship with a covert ops cloak or a large ship that will be locked either way that you are hull tanking
---
They just changed jump freighters to be able to jump to covert cynos. Trade routes are now wherever you want them to be. 
---
Hopefully this breathes a bit more life into stain, if nothing else
---
Jellyfish don't have brains.  
---
Sounds like most who rush into supers &amp; titans
---
And bounty is not only generated in ns. But in both cases we can argue most of it is from wh( blue loot) and ns (bountys)
---
When was the last time a serious blow was taken under the umbrella lol ? Two years ago ? Jay's Rev ? Not too glorious frequency lol
---
How do you think a capital brawl will occur after the changes
---
CAPF best F
---
Haha check ingame market graph in jita.
---
Wow so the umbrella doesn't even cover all of delve? How very unimpressive.
---
Oi mouthy boy, talk to be about BOZI ihub, what happend?
---
We can make a conspiracy  
---
We will come up with a story linking epsteins death to ccp and the recent blackout and a large amount of isk and ships dissapearing eventually leading back to the csm the clintons and falcon
---
Your not playing during what ppl consider USTZ 
---
That's all your using an example of why YOU can catch these events vs regular 9-5 USTZ guys
---
Depends on LP shop, but 1200 ISK/LP would make me very sad. I am sitting on conversion rates of 2300-5000 ISK/LP (depending on the BPC) in Lowsec.
---
i mean, its a european company, with European work times....
---
Are you implying that a WH person who does not crab is doing WH wrong?
---
What OP doesn’t realize is goons would use this to keep a Delve hole open 24/7, bubblefuck and camp all the stations, and then stage their blops sig out of Thera.
---
Well, cynos arent really as much of a threat after the cyno changes. And even then, the cyno ships need to get in first.
---
Bro, All minerals dropped in price since 2014
---
was he lost in 2014 when this drop started?
---
I just solve within one cycle.
---
To be fair, now that abyssals exist the commodity section would be off. Go back until just before the abyssal expansion and that will give you better numbers
---
I would say Damps (Gallente ewar) is more versatile. But if ECM is your thing go for it. Whatever makes you happy. It's a game :)
---
Happy Cake Day 1darklight1! Today you are you, that is truer than true. There is no one alive who is youer than you.
---
Big mouth
---
i must be missing your point
---
10 per hour is really heavy grind (calculating some jumps inbetween, time for a drink or a smoke etc.) I would say its 6 (10 minutes per mission with travel, ship swapping, time to scratch your balls) to 10 (work that shit). 0.1 Lowsec its 19.2k LP per mission.
---
Nestor + Leshak is nice
---
I pyfa'd a 1 nestor + 2 leshak fit that could theorically do all C5 anoms + drifter and that's is compatible with CV too.
---
wow you guys are retards
---
&gt;Well, cynos arent really as much of a threat 
---
What? Have you only played one side of the game and have a singular perspective or something...    
---
You can do log off traps in the past, now you don't even need it, a covert frig can go into a carebear pocket with no local intel and light cynos all day using covert and people can hit you from multiple regions away using Blops bridges (&gt;8 LY range).  For instance, one of my favorite blops ranges in null can hit over 295 ratting systems. You don't have WH systems that can be hit by 295 different areas that can be unscouted.  
---
The cyno changes impact the carebear's ability to bring in defenders and faxes. The changes are more of a risk to the null defender than not a threat.
---
The tax on player stations now is roughly the cost of tax and broker fees on npc stations before the change.
---
i wouldn't be super stuffed up wif they removed all capitals from the game. Imo something that's an order of magnitude more expensive and more powerful just shouldn't exist.
---
What ship would you do these with? Tengu?
---
anyone who actually lives and pvp's in lowsec knows supers and titans arnt the issue. you hardly see them engaging besides the odd solo hel in faction warfare entrances. and ofc groups CTA's or w.e not roaming or fun things.
---
&gt; Just NS could use some actual risk.
---
The point of nullsec was always that players take and own the space.
---
So players did. And they created structures, both literally and figuratively, to defend their space. So now they're safe in the space that they own. Why *shouldn't* this be the case? What would be the point of alliance/empire building if it amounted to fuck all?
---
I bought Plex 2 months ago and I bought them a week ago.
---
2 months ago they were over 4m a piece.
---
With recon cynos.
---
The point is that the chart doesn't describe either.
---
Square peg round hole
---
No.
---
delve has some strange arms coming off it to the south. dumb asses don't pay enough attention to it.
---
But i needed that nanite paste! :D
---
but erm, fighting these guys, ALWAYS go for the scram and smartbomb thier pods! xD (they fly implanted all the time)
---
Dude can't even buy a wall in his own country. He's got no chance.
---
Fly a kitsune instead, jam people at 100km, and ask them in local how much the ability to target you is improving their experience.
---
I did not know that tbh. 
---
April 2018 MER: https://webimg.ccpgamescdn.com/7lhcm73ukv5p/5PUuPS3lTiMOAaq2IgQk6U/51cc95e00e4c176431f8d048128bb386/9a_sinksfaucets.png
---
18.000B commldity market compared to 23.000B today would reduce the percentage of 47% to 37.5%.
---
But id still argue that there are a manifold more people in ns compared to wh but I do not have those numbers so I may be wrong. And as long as we dont get a better brake down in the mer its all guess work
---
Recon uncloaks, tackles Super/Carrier/Rorq, (if) the tackled ship's pilot has a brain he has fitted a decent tank and not a "MAX dank ticks fit", so it calls for help nearby (if it doesn't have a Recon alt already cloaked there), subcaps arrive, a Recon lights a cyno while the fleet clears tackle around the ship to be saved and enemy capitals jump in. 
---
Now cynos continue to be lit by different side's Recons or heavily tanked Blops (which can also get there through covert cynos use by faster and more agile ships), but now have to watch their asses and think where to position to avoid getting one-shotted out of grid.
---
Not saying this is good or bad, everyone already has a formed opinion on the subject, that's just how I picture capital escalations.
---
But maybe, just maybe, people will reconsider using their big toys as a response to fucking everything and relly more on subcapital doctrines.
---
What the fuck?
---
I have mostly played as a nullseccer, about 2 years. The cyno changes add risk to both sides, its not like you cant keep recons around your systems to have an entry for fleets. And the fact that the cynos are a lot more squishy now, means you have a higher chance of nuking the cyno before too many get through. It really works for both sides, and logoff traps are a huge threat in wormholes as well, more so than null, because you dont have people 24/7 to watch every entrance.
---
People can still roll into you.  
---
Also, I dont understand people who leave holes critted and then proceed to rat. Why not roll it completely?  And not die to a confessor fleet like a lowbob.
---
i think a few months ago, olmeca made a post about it. some dude gating a titan.
---
theres still a lot off supers and titans the do die under umbrella but its just because ever there not on coms in fleet or don't pay enough attention.
---
Have you tried getting gud?
---
The difference between HS/LS/NS is suppose to be risk vs reward. The risk is virtually removed in NS if you have even 2 iq points which is why they are adding more risk.
---
It's not just empire building that's the point of lowsec.
---
i mean, they had 
---
Sleip
---
Malediction
---
Jackdaw
---
Drake Navy
---
They ALL fly with expensive pods, they pretty much ALL have expensive fits with rare occasions you dont see an abyssal somthing on there, theyre good kiting pilots, but this was not a gank. it was a small gang fight from looking at the killboards.
---
you gotta also keep in mind tho that on average a WH guy is boxing 4-5 toons to make their ISK, while in NS you just sit in standing fleet and try not to fall asleep
---
You got some salty goons replies down there haha ! love it I will use it on my steak today
---
Like 6 years ago, then my kid grew a bit and RL took over.
---
Hell why not, but this need to go one way or another.
---
Jump a cloacked recon by a gate without any one noticing it.
---
Yeah, but they dropped to 1.6-7 bil for 500, and now they're back at 1.8 bil+
---
Plex price has absolutely began to climb again.
---
Don't forget that those chaos changes are meant to damage nullsec emprires, because hisec p(l)ayers cried that their mining and missions are not profitable.
---

Recon=cloak, you cloak the recon next to the bait. In fact, the only way the attackers would even know its bait now would be a difference in tank fitting if they bothered to scan you. I’m going to need you to tilt your head at a 90 degree angle and get that spod out.
---
The point is it allows an educated guess and that educated guess strongly suggests that the 80% the guy i awnsered to are rather BS numbers, especially after blackout and im guessing cyno changes also. Now July and August MER will paint a better picture of that and tbh a change for more risk in ns is good, I just dont think the reward is there that justifys it.
---
Just to save you some time in the future. Ctrl+Shift+V removes all formatting directly.
---
Knowledge of the game would be pretty important. Experience in customer Service would also be a plus. A good attitude and being sociable helps to make work more enjoyable for everyone.
---
From my experience there is a hell of a lot of content on at the moment. I believe there was a 1+ trillion cap brawl less than 24 hrs ago.
---
Maybe the downsides of being blue to half the game are becoming evident?
---
It's been said before but Ctrl+Shift+V should solve this.
---
And a NS dude multiboxes rorqs (enough memes of that) myrm ratters, ded runners and so on. While we at it a pvp alt in standing and maybe a scout. IDK how multibox plays into the fundamwntal argument tbh.
---
Doesnt everyone? Somethings are just not meant to be on pizza.
---
&gt; The cyno changes add risk to both sides
---
It doesn't because the hunter will always be prepared more than the carebear.
---
&gt; And the fact that the cynos are a lot more squishy now 
---
Since the context is about carebears being safer in WHs vs carebears in null, imagine a scenario where you have a blops fleet drop on a carebearing Carrier. In the past it can light a cyno and faxes can save. Now, it's going to die. He's not going to have a Recon follow him around with his carrier or ratting dread. There is a prepared fleet to kill him.  There is no prepared fleet to defend him. You dont need a "tanky" cyno to drop capitals, just look at the prospect's killboard to prove a point -- capitals die despite a covert frigate lighting the cyno. This is the risk you find in null that is not controllable.   
---
For WHs, you just roll a hole if its too hot.  For null, you are going to roll &gt;8 light years (295 systems for one example) they can drop you from? The answer is no.
---
Can you please quote the part where I said they were an issue? 
---
I was actually thinking about their involvement in battles around strategic objectives like structures or escalations, which most big groups won't even go near without a couple of batphones and small-ish groups won't even engage if they know there is a supercapital fleet at the end of the cyno. Dropping Supers on small gangs is also a thing in LS.
---
If you remove supercapitals from lowsec people will still use capitals (which I agree with hy, need a nerf against subcaps), making fights more interesting and accessible for those small or growing groups that CCP supposedly want to live there.
---
And if you think I don't "actually live and pvp's in lowsec", you are either talking out of your ass or your intel gathering is so bad that you are borderline retarded.
---
Maybe ill see you here!
---
&gt;Recon uncloaks, tackles Super/Carrier/Rorq (...)  not a "MAX dank ticks fit"            
---
I am talking about **BRAWL** not a fucking care-bear hunting with this baiting.             
---
Like you know people that **want to shoot something**.         
---
The main problem i see with hour assumption is that - the winning side will one that manages to kill out enemy cyno ships faster.
---
I used to run 3 separate cloaky nulli tengus, running blitzable missions until I had 5-8 burner per account. Then you run all the burners in a row. It usually took an hour of tengus at maybe 300m an hour total, with probably 40k LP an hour per character. With Guristas at 2.5k isk / lp when I did them. The hour of burners was really high isk. Like 100k LP per character no problem. Sometimes as high 150k LP per chacter in just an hour. You would end up making close to 800-900m an hour across the three characters. Thats not including transporting the BPCs and implants tho, and sometimes you dont roll burners so its kinda based on luck. The new Social drugs help tho
---
&gt;I hope you are right about CCP banning Supers from Lowsec, it would make things way more fun
---
i was referring to this....
---
Ofcourse its Karen &lt;.&lt;
---
If only this game had more people like you, trading would be a much easier :D
---
Sure, wormhole. Problem solved.
---
But they are still down.
---
This is too real; I guess I should play wow... you have complete the cycle for me
---
The same thing applies to arrenged fights or battles over objectives, but even easier since the defending group will be properly prepared to bring their fleet.
---
And yes, killing cynos and choosing where to light them will soon become a major thing which will decide the outcome of battles (you make it sound impossible to light cynos is strategic possitions); how is that a bad thing?
---
Big battles would be even more of a slideshow
---
except maybe if you hit one of those wrekcs where you get the t3c invention loot. But you should see it on warpin
---
Tears here
---
?
---
Would you like to purchase some tinfoil with that?
---
sock sock shoe shoe....what is this sock shoe sock shoe nonsense?   
---
Allow me to go full nerd.   
---
Many cultures around the world (unknown to us Americans) leave their shoes at the door. After living here in Iceland I was surprised to find out that many nordic countries have this practice of leaving your shoes at the door, no matter what. Coming from the Us I always thought it was something tied to Asian cultures, but nei.   
---
So with this in mind, How am i expected to sock shoe sock shoe at my front door. Obviously, i put my socks on first and THEN go put my shoes on at the front door. If we were back in America (this applies to Latin America as well as i lived there for 12 years) then wearing your shoes inside your home up to and including next to your bed....THEN I could see sock shoe sock shoe working.   
---
TLDR: Gave way too long an explanation justifying sock sock shoe shoe
---
But what flavor is it?
---
I hope you are good again?
---
Hmm I can see how this becomes an issue. With the only solution being jumping more caps off grid but then you are fucked with stop bubbles or the even worse case scenario of being probed and bubbled where you jumped in.
---
There's a lot of "Depends" when it comes to making ISK from missions. That's why I lowballed it on the ISK to LP estimation - all be it using a poor choice of phrase. If you have time and patience, you can get some really good LP to ISK conversion rates, but if you're just looking to make quick cash now then you're going to have to accept lower rates.
---
This is not how it's done. Imagine having 20 gankers that are -10.   
---
Not going to work out too well.
---
Well, that first quote doesn't mean that Supers "are the problem" in any way, just that I consider them a big disincentive to fun fights as I explained before. LS problems are far more complicated and a lot of people (me included) have wrote shittons of pages about them.
---
And yes, moving Supers would of course be impossible and that kind of hunting will move to NPC Nullsec, which I don't really consider a bad thing... we can't have it all sadly.
---
Last time XIX entered into an agreement with Winter they got backstabbed and lost detorid as well as a large chunk of their super fleet. Why would they do that twice?
---
someone give him the gank calculator sheet, as im o  mobile atm :)
---
You are the one being stupid here, by first taking this post seriously and trying to explain the obvious and then rejecting the OP's claim as it was actually a meme post in the first place. Get your narrative straight.
---
Why dont you use the cap booster variant With the dmg mods ?
---
&gt; Recon uncloaks, tackles Super/Carrier/Rorq 
---
Read where i said capital brawl
---
&gt; Now cynos continue to be lit by different side's Recons or heavily tanked Blops 
---
So randomly suicide 500m and 2b ships to hopefully get your caps in system? Thats what you are suggesting
---
&gt;But maybe, just maybe, people will reconsider using their big toys as a response to fucking everything
---
This will only apply to the second cap fleet in system. The first will be able to get their whole capital in system with ease and just have to pop recons and bubble defensively for total control.
---
So you don't have tomatoes on your pizza? 
---
It was a trick question, I'm sorry.
---
What Lelouch said...but Fish. All day every day Fish. I love it. Pasta Carbonada. Bacon and Eggs in the morning.
---
in my 1.5year stint i did living in lowsec.
---
i did capital drops, small gang, 'owned' an area with a small group of like 15dudes (mostly only 5-8 online at any one time)
---
we did rorqual mining, managed to grab an R64 from some bigger local friends for a short while.
---
we did tonnes of pvp and titan bridging around blackrise, placid, had literally a carrier roam just dropping and dropping with like 4carriers fucking about seeing how far we could get away from where we started xD
---
at no point did we feel supers were an issue. only when it came to the best or better territory did a group with supers dick wave and be more powerful. BUT THAT IS FINE they are more powerful because they could house and own supers. like, why is that a problem. the weak should loose and the strong should win.
---
but everyday pvp, fun roams, gatecamping supers were never the issue.
---
People actually took this post seriously and then tried to spin it when they figured they got baited. This sub never ceases to amaze me. Bunch of fat, four-eyed neck beards trying to look smart.
---
There are also lots of miners, salvagers and pretty much a lot of anything that can be done with a decent profit. There are a lot of people playing EVE after all.
---
But if you are looking to not so common activities, of the top of my head I can think of Clone Hunting (searching LS belts for Clone Transport to get their tags and Mordu's Legion ships to get BPCs) and drugs production... this last isn't that rare since they were made legal, but it's not something you hear about every day.

Soe orca with 5 sec recloak timer and high agility, carrier sized smb and large fleet hangar, bonused for armor repairs, boosts and scanning, with the innate agility to allow mwd/cloak trick. 
---
yes pls, but eh ...
---
When I orginally posted the BR hadn't been formulated yet and could only see a sleipnir.
---
However i think my main point I was trying to formulate was more its not exactly a km worth posting on reddit about. They brought a good counter to active tanked kiters (bhaalgorns) and blobbed the shit out of them.
---
I understand they were defending their space etc etc and they may have outplayed them by catching him however it's still kinda not worth posting on reddit.
---
Hey your probably new to pvp and good on you for getting the km but its nothing special :)
---
A corp can never have enough logistic people and logi pilots!
---
yeh, i mean, rote and integ alwas fly shiney, and theyre alwasy rewarding to kill for some reason.
---
this guys post was more about the fact it dropped like 80-90% of everything good. along with a little proud of the kill too im sure.
---
and the kiters here are very used to dealing with the arazus and bhaals and the like, even with the correct ships they can still be annoying and difficult to catch.
---
Yeah and I was explaining why your picture was mis guided
---
Until they are vollyed before a cyno can open
---
Maybe salvager? Most players have their own Salvager alt, but i guess some alphas would agree to letting you salage/loot their stuff for a share of the Profits.
---
I want the 1.4B HE has laying around, more is always better.
---
I like you. Can I send you some socks.
---
And yet again (last time): I didn't say they are a problem or an issue to any of those things, which I do on a daily basis without almost never seeing a Supercapital.
---
Please read my previous answers again if you still have doubts about what I meant.
---
Really? I thought ewar was the least popular one
---
Are you talking about the guy that tried to move on his own when they were deployed?
---
What

I made my own soda stream once. You can buy kits on Amazon and use normal soda bottles. The tank of CO2, i was able to get from a local bar/pub supplier. I carbonated coffee once. was....interesting. At the time i lived in a country where you could not find soda stream at all. Plus, this ended up way cheaper in the long run.   
---
Search for:
---
*  CO2 tank regulator (maybe throw the word keg/kegerator or soda on the search too)
---
* 5/16 Gas line assembly ball lock
---
* Stainless Carbonation Cap Counter Pressure Bottle Filling With 5/16" Barb (plastic ones exist but i feel they are too weak)
---
And how do you picture capital brawls?
---
no idea i just know olmeca posted about it
---
It's one of the things you fit shiny for. Your always gonna have to fight outnumbered and what not. 
---
The fact you say they are used to countering bhaals and arazu's sort of backs my point even more as they clearly fit to take down the higher skilled pilots. Not something worth boasting about.
---
As for the drops I'd love to see the stats on that abyssal SB but still not sure why he posted in reddit about it. If he fit any cheaper the sleip wouldn't be nearly as effective and faction mods give you the edge needed over your opponents.
---
Redline hows your life outside of goonswarm ?

---
cant take it away, as much as i wish they were, they all seem to be good pilots.
---
its SUPER annoying when you see them make a mistake or you have a chance to grab but thier snake pod saves them. but thats eve. and i guess its also what makes it fun chasing or fighting them xD
---
i mean is eve in skill the piloting or the countering? knowing how to counter is a level of skill also, plenty out there that have no clue and whelp hard.
---
if these guys went toe to toe without pods and bling im pretty sure theyd trade evenly just like anyone else.
---
\&gt; 25% - when hes at 10% were going to overload  
---
\&gt; 24% - tell your fleet to overload nownownownownow
---
CapF, don't apply without Thermodynamics V.
---
I in fact do these in a tengu, yes. I think every t3 can do them, in fact you can even ship down, but tengu was my choice due to skills, and ofc of beeing nullified whilst flying through nullsec. :) Only downside is missiles if you're on a longer trip. Thatswhy you learn very quick how to most efficiently blitz them, to use the least amount of missiles :D
---
For Radiance and Independence i never refit, but use the travel variation, for hierarchy it depends, you have to kite alot if you wanna blitz it, otherwise refit to tank fit, or clear waves. Thats something you figure out over the time, how you can be pretty effective.
---
OP are you secretly Hilmar?
---
This is a nonsensical argument.
---
Cynos open and allow ships through faster than most things can lock onto them, much less apply damage.
---
Plenty of T3s open cynos and get most o fthe fleet through before they even take 15% shield damage.
---
Loads of fights posted here on YouTube don't have cynos at much risk.
---
It takes 3 seconds for a recon to decloak, light the cyno and people to already be jumping to it.
---
Show me a video of people killing a recon within 3 seconds of it decloaking.
---
I'll be waiting.
---
Logistic pilots fly logistic ships (obviously) which repair armor, repair shield, transfer cap to the ship in need, and such. Everbody wants more of them.
---
Would it be possible in a Stratios? And if not, do you have a Loki fit? I've technically trained one, but haven't used it outside of a logi-loki in fleet combat
---
Hey don't drag me into this, nothing to do with me.
---
Ah found it. [This one](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bgsges/first_titan_to_die_under_the_delve_umbrella_since/), right? Yeah that died right under the umbrella. A severe case of spodbrain, the doctors could only help him by putting an end to his suffering.
---
That structure bomb circling your subcap fleet was hilarious
---
day 3: the locals have accepted me into their flock. i am now a kikimora.
---
Carriers are already nerfed to hell and can barely kill a rifter...
---
I wish I was having this much fun.
---
That's definitely debatable considering half of them are renters and the pilot himself posted on the thread informing us of the mistake he made to get caught.
---
Its most likely they were just protecting their space. They should try FW or roam to low sec if they wanna learn pvp.
---
They can do 5 of these posts on reddit a day if they're active enough :)
---
Heard DnG are recruiting...
---
The real elite crab technique is single seiging it with 3 nags.
---
that's the one.
---
The when they JP a bunch of caps in, you decloak your recon and dic and bubble them, and jump your capitals in. Easy.
---
You might be the worst eve player of you can't figure this out.
---
Missing the point. Thats not repeatable income. You are limited by the sites you have in your home. Sure you can nomad around, dropping a small pos in each hole, but its annoying to do. Its best to run your home sites with dreads, and static sites with something else
---
Yes, but now that there is only one incursion at a time the alpha friendly group (warp to me) is getting pushed out of all the good sites by some Russians who use Leshaks, so you can't make as much is as you used to be able to
---

7. A monthly fee can be avoided by earning enough ISK (Currency in game) to buy PLEX, which buys you your subscription. That being said, reaching the state where you can do this without it being a drag is much easier if you're willing to subscribe for 2-3 months near the start of your careers. It can definitely be done without, but might go over your grind tolerance threshold.
---
The reason that most of my answers are the same is that the diverse paths the game offers means that you should be able to generate a plan that suits your exact group requirements.
---
Can I have 1 system? :(
---
That's unique I've messed around with a rorqual solo fit just cause also had the idea for what you were doing surprised I haven't seen anyone else do it.
---
are you seriously getting excited over 1.5B in drops in this day and age?
---
I'd say a stratios can most definitly do them. You have to keep an eye on your drones, as npc's might focus them and especially frigates can be mean drone killers.
---
I can't fly a loki, so i cannot really give you a fit. But a t2 fitted loki active shield fit is sufficient i think, it's comparable to the fit i use for these. Something around pith x-type large shield booster + one t2 adaptive can be already enough, if you kite around. You just have to get a feeling. :) If you put 2 adaptives and something that covers your lowest resist, you are well set. 
---
In worst case put a damage control in your lows, and if you feel comfortable, put more damage mods into the lows. :)
---
Logistics people as in moving stuff around are extremely useful, since its a pretty boring job that can easily end in a suicide gank and billions lost if you aren't careful. 
---
Logi pilots as in space healers are the most necessary role in any fleet fight. Doesn't matter how much dps you have, if you have enough logi to keep all of your ships alive then you can't lose a fight. They are usually more common numerically in fights than ewar ships, but ewar ships have a lot of stacking penalties so having too many of them becomes less useful over time, while the logi stacking penalties aren't very harsh until you get a bunch of FAXes on grid.
---
What the heck are you even talking about.
---
Yeh I made the concept when I was bored, and it happened to work. 4 full damage snakes + a rorqual is like 7500 dps. It clears sites super quickly
---
I have hundreds of millions of it just sitting around or deleted.
---
can you explain me how mining creats money ? 
---
never got any isk dropped by a rock
---
keeps the content alive. Would be no fun if they would not come to delve. There are already too many people afraid of the umbrella. Its good that here and there an idiot dies. Does make us look mortal to some degree :) Keep coming boys and girls. I am too damn lazy to move out of delve for content.
---
Well, it's not changed.. so I guess it was a no?
---
Eve has to have the highest ratio of good graphics/time spent looking at the graphics of any game ever.
---
Vnis made 45m per hour, a subcap in high sec can make almost triple that before lp.
---
Remind me which is worth doing when they're involving the same amount of effort?
---
Why is Muninn one of the most common doctrine ship in null? What makes them so good? What effect will the upcoming cyno change have on them?
---
No, 3 nags can travel together.
---
Don't even need a pos.
---
Because t3s that light cynos in big fights are brick tanked with far more ehp then a recon and now with multiple back up cynos in system.
---
I'm not sure how I would find a video of a recon being used as an in cyno for a large brawl because that would be idiotic.
---
Having an umbrella doesn't increase npc bounties.
---
It's good!
---
I am talking about real fights not small gang moving out of WH
---
No but it makes reduces their risk making it worth while.
---
You know that Cyno changes are not in effect atm?   
---
So all is working normally
---
You're making assumptions about my argument that aren't true.  
---
Either he's a krab, in which case he's definitely doing it wrong, or he's a PvPer, in which case he ought to either: (a) have a krab hole; (b) have a secondary isk stream; or (c) at least loot the wrecks of his victims.  If he doesn't have 1.4B laying around, he's doing something wrong.
---
That you can be in any of the groups if you have enough alts ^(not an issue in extractor era)
---
CAPITAL BRAWLS:
---
1. YOU BAIT
---
2. ENEMY CAP JUMP
---
3. YOU RECON DECLOAK
---
4. YOU RECON LIGHT CYNO
---
5. YOU DICTOR BUBBLE UP
---
6. YOU CAPITAL JUMP
---
Touche
---
Sure but you can't travel back. So if you have a C6-C5, or a C5-C5, you can add 20b a week easy to your income by running static sites
---
&gt;  (you make it sound impossible to light cynos is strategic possitions); how is that a bad thing?
---
Cyno inhibitors, drag bubbles and so on.         
---
Caps align slowly.
---
I've seen armor cynos not even break shields when jumping capitals onto supers.
---
And a recon can definitely be tanked better than an armor T3s shields.
---
Supers aren't applying that much damage to a cyno that quickly when already in a fight.
---
Thats true, forgot to mention that I run Burners since introduction, and have a well established setup of tag buyorders (cause you need tags for BPCs). For fast cashout options like Implants, or Faction Ammo 500-1000 ISK/LP is very reasonable ...
---
Your thread talks about changes (plural) ccp has made recently and how they have lead to “less targets in space”.
---
If you think nerds are going to let these cyno changes get in the way of dunking each other, id suggest you stop sipping the koolaid for a minute. 
---
Lots of stuff will still die. You might just need to put some effort in.
---
kek
---
1. Link tax to security status of the system for higsec and lowsec.     
---
2. Add additional NPC tax based on transaction volume           
---
... and you have multiple trade hubs.
---
You asked how to get a recon passed a gate.
---
I gave you answer.
---
You have trouble thinking in 3d don't you?
---
Thats the whole problem we are moving from eve where people need to commit to eve where you just see nano shit and bombers.
---
integretas and rote last time i saw them lived in lowsec. and happily roamed nullsec etc etc.
---
Sure because i will always have WH leading to system next door, and there again next wh leading to nearby system.
---
As a footnote, I want to thank GitHub user taleden who inspired me to rework graphs. He submitted absolutely awesome pull request ~2 years ago, which unfortunately has been left hanging in the air for a long time (as far as i understand, mostly because another Pyfa dev, Blitzmann, just reworked graphs and taleden's DPS sim graph was looking poorly within infrastructure Pyfa had at that point). I took an effort and merged both concepts, taking - hopefully - only better ideas from both.
---
Almost every other smaller feature was implemented as I was changing graphs and was discovering various things I did not like here and there.
---
I'm not stating they are nullbears, I assumed they were either low seccers or wormholers.
---
TIL eve commitment  = nano and bombers.
---
Loads of content is still happening post these new changes happening, loads more will continue post the cyno changes. 
---
Sorry you won’t be able to insta save every rorq and carrier now. Som effort will be required.
---
yeah saddly the changes coming to the game is gonna thin the numbers off the lazy and  moron
---
Oi ey brav! Imma let you fuken kno imdabest at wow ey! Foken duel me u puzzi boi!
---
You're still thinking too small and specific.
---
Oh no, stuff will take the tiniest bit of effort. Oh no!!
---
you're a wise man
---
Aren´t you still putting a dread´s worth of ISK into the site that can be tackled just as easily, but that doesn´t bring the dps of a dread? Based on my limited knowledge you either run subcaps only, so you are difficult to tackle and skip the avengers, OR you run capitals only, where you are easier to tackle but clear the site fast.
---
For C6 sites you could literally bring a solo dread and run the sites just as fast (with only a single account and probably commit a lot less ISK to the field). 
---
So I do not really see the point, EXCEPT if you have very low SP pilots, but then again C5 rattles work with around 2M SP already, so there´s that.
---
Look on the bright side, maybe now you can finally leave the kiddie pool and go do some actual PVP.
---
it's not in space though..
---
nice
---
@hey OP, wow classic is comming out on 27.08, think that game is more for you!
---
no it doesn't.
---
you're not going to use a subcap to cyno in anything from the umbrella. subcaps eat shit way too fast for a cyno to do anything.
---
autism.txt
---
Thank you for this. Care to share the fits of the rorq and rattles?
---
Hopefully not buying supers
---
No tank max dps subs eat shit before they can cyno.
---
It's not that subcaps can't it's that you don't want to tank them outside of the bare minimum to do the site.
---
fax
---
The rorq costs roughly 2.2 bil, you dont need to pimp fit it at all. You barely even need to rep with it. I literally never lost a rorq doing this over the past 2 years, where ive lost several dreads through the years. A solid PVE dread will cost 4-5b, and you are way less likely to get off if rolled into. Also solo dreading doesn't work very well, and makes way less money than this setup. Minimum you would need 2 dreads, which defeats the purpose of the setup which is farming your static.
---
The other part of course is the SP. You need 4 seperate character with minimum 30m SP each to effectively run a cap escalation hole. Not everyone has those kind of SP assets
---
Fits?
---
I would recommend avoiding warp core stabs, the penalties they give are pretty serious, plus the lost slots are a big deal. You're probably better off fitting inertial stabilizers instead which will let you get into warp faster. 
---
Download pyfa (https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/PYFA) and start playing with your fit. If you can get it to align in under two seconds then nothing will catch you outside of nullsec / wormholes.
---
Booshing is now allowed in Highsec.
---
Booshing also makes you go suspect.
---
hell yeah this would be lit and would fix the perpetual bumping without the arbitrary and harsh 3 minute timer
---
Nope, UO is better.      
---
But i will probably just end up in E:D ^(aka still spaceships)
---
You sir, are a legend
---
Not everything is about the money. You miners are always thinking about isk. So greedy.

Just edited the main post with the fits
---
According to you I’m a krab, or a PvPer who should also krab
---
What’s the difference then?  Stop trying to put players in boxes.
---
What am I according to you if I splash around huffing gas, hacking relics, and hauling PI but still refit or reship to go at everything I think I have a chance at? 
---
I’m trying to hunt a bit now, I’m trying a Astero bait/tackle followed by a Strat.
---
Thank you for updating the post with the fits &lt;8
---
I edited the main post with the fits
---
Running burners in a frigate ^(mostly guristas now), having 3 pullers.
---
CCP not interested... busy masterbating to R/EVE small gang shit talk...
---
Most of EVE's difficulty comes from getting the correct fit, finding the right opportunity and planning. Not the mechanical prowess often required in other MMOs
---
And here, ladies and gentlemen, is the thought process of the average goon.
---
Fak your capitals and F1 clown lag fieasta degenerate 50 years old shits with max 20apm.
---
I don't know if CCP is aware how small this            
---
&gt;R/EVE small gang               
---
is small in terms of actual players.
---
Fleet commander.
---
Nice catch and dunk. Keep up the good work.
---
You can probably still use cov ops to light covert cynos if you are just going for the looks
---
Great stuff, thanks!
---
What they want is easy kills. In WH they'd have to fight to keep their stuff.
---
CCP literally gave you rorquals, injectors, fighters, and more. Since b-r the rl value of a titan reduced from something like 50000 Plex to something like 10000 Plex. Yet you failed to fight your capital battles. 
---
Now at least we daily roamers are getting a few exciting changes. Stop bargaining and don't throw your shade. If you really want capital gudfites you can always 500 vs 500 at the sun, prearrange fights like wormholers do.
---
Literally everyone hates krabs, thats pretty unpopular if you just scroll down on reddit
---
rorquals leaving POS shields were a mistake.
---
also, I just hobodreaded for a while and built up a nice nest egg. this is a lot more isk but requires more accounts, and fuck that.
---
Roamer get what? They get empty systems, way more then before blackout.
---
Blackout has been the best month for most of us.
---
&gt;I was expecting [..] a direct attack under the umbralla
---
This meant "I'm disappointed this attack wasn't under the umbrella"
---
I always found hobodreading to be so much effort. I also felt super nervous having that much blue loot with me at once
---
https://zkillboard.com/group/30/losses/region/10000060/
---
I didn't want the rorquals, injectors or fighters ^(but honestly i liked fighter after the changes as it was something different).            
---
Daily roamers will still be rolled by formed up defensive fleets, but this will just kill escalations.             
---
This roamers is also pretty damn small group.            
---
I don't know if you don't see or don't want to see what is happening in eve.              
---
You are a CSM now, ask CCP how many people have quit or even bio massed chars.          
---
EvE is niche game and currently is bleeding players every day.
---
Logistics is moving stuff. Logi is healer.
---
Eve is weird.
---
I feel you on that one i figure that if i broadcast my mistakes their is more incentive  to be better next time :)
---
Cheers man will continue to do so :)
---
Yeah seems like they are pretty sensitive about the umbrella thing
---
Being the guy who has to scan down all 60 signatures in a drifter wormhole and burn 100km to jump through them all to check where they go.  Useful for groups who hunt? Yes.  Fun? Not much...
---
Yeh man the one i oh so messed up xD gf man
---
Hmm, from my knowledge a Nagl can solo Citadels in 3 siege cycles (only refit for SBs towards the end) and Bastions (more hassle with refits than a Citadel, but doable) in 4 siege cycles, which certainly isn´t bad money considering you are doing it with only one account. Not sure how exactly would the two setups stack against each other though.  
---
On the other hand I can see how it is a lot more diffiult to kill a rorqual as opposed to a dread, but then again at the end of the day doesn´t this usually depend of what **the other guy has on hand**, as opposed to what **you** can bring to bail yourself out? But I can imagine the reps being quite tough to break without the support of a significant fleet.
---
He just got preinhibbed like any other dude. Could have been anyone.
---
No worries my friend
---
Does the rorq escalate the site? (Spawn more BS rats)
---
What is this booshing?  Sounds like fun.
---
No need for a bot in this case.
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/78525215/ is fit
---
I like the part where the Recon tackles the Supercapital.
---
I still remember the paranoia some people had when we moved from 1999 to 2000 and then how i was laughing from the same people when someone explained them that 2000 was last year of XX so they panicked again on 2000 -&gt; 2001.                 
---
Do you remember the '00' code panic for the old systems.
---
Bridge it in with a Blops well in advance. Only takes three accounts to do what took one account before.
---
But how could PIRAT maintain their 3 dps to 12 logi ship ratio during fights while hugging a gate if they get booshed? You'll get half of their members banned for losing ships in 1 boosh.
---
New graphs 😲😲😲
---
Pyfa team are legends keep up the great work!
---
NO SOUP FOR YOU
---
With factions yes, but not with sec status.
---
Because they already pull shit isk/hour as max dps.  Any lower and it defeats the purpose of doing the activity. L4s in osmon become more lucrative.
---
Shots fired
---
Solo Dreads can 3 cycle / 4 cycle those sites only if you run them perfectly. It's very hard work compared to idly assigning a painter or a rep.
---
I was thinking about Cap or Rorq (also included there) when I wrote that, my bad.
---
Strategy vs tactics
---
You are snowflake of this game playin 50 or more accounts at time.
---
But i voted for you xD
---
Pretty much anyone in null whose main activity is not krabbing is happy with the changes. I might be a snowflake but I do keep in touch with my voter base.
---
Bait need to move by gates in order to be a bait.        
---
This is why smarter people cargo scan ships for LO.
---
&gt;Since b-r the rl value of a titan reduced from something like 50000 Plex to something like 10000 Plex. Yet you failed to fight your capital battles.
---
UALX. 9-4RP, X47, in addition to many other capital fights that didnt deveolve into doomsday volleys. Or is it all FAKE NEWS! in your world?
---
&gt;And how do you picture capital brawls?             
---
That is the issue - you will get HUUGE very rare battles , and ....
---
Then go do missions in osmon afking in your mrym is still less effort then L4s. That is why you run them over a torp phoon fleet with 1.4k dps or a rattle.
---
Your not doing it for the isk/effort.
---
The view from TKE is gorgeous.
---
Honestly I feel like the "avatar" is getting ready to awox with that red interior and the sharp turn at the end...
---
It does not make sense that they can dock as criminals in hisec Empire stations.     I don't actually remember seeing any pirate factino stations in hisec but your point about corps is a valid one.
---
Only reason to blow them up is to make the space lines safer.   It is amusing to me that a player who was asking for help in the AG channel was a pirate type who had no issue with CODE just like you, except until he did..
---
You're saying a solo Nag can 3 cycle a C6 Citadel?
---
It was, it's not now you have to spam dscan every 2 seconds.
---
I guess they forgot. Spod can't be that good on your memory. Spod, not even once.
---
You jump to a cyno.        
---
It need to be on spot or it will be blapped.            
---
* single dictor can warp to you and lock you out from joining the fight                
---
* same dictor can drop bubbles into cyno direction and stop you on edge of fight giving clear exit vector into opposite direction        
---
* bunch of frigates can warp in and tackle some of the caps        
---
* people will bump from each other so you will not warp as one group at the same time               
---
Add to this fact that caps are slow at aligning so you are giving plenty time to clear the tackle.               
---
On top of this add fact that you try to do it on the enemy terms ^(their home space) you have limited escalation ability while they can bring all the **cynos they need**          
---
Like in order to spawn big fight you don't drop your whole fleet at the same time - just tackle something drop 3-4 dreads and wait for the response before you jump in rest of the ships.
---
im pretty unhappy... lost 50% players. Social aspect of the game disappeared, you cant talk to anyone with no chat. You are happy? Sure im depressed and i dont give a fuck about small group of elites having fun.
---
I wont join nullsec blob or move my assets again and again and again. As long as my friends  are moving away from the game there is no reason to stay. For me this game was a place to krab and have fun i didnt move from wh to nullsec to sit in dark empty space.
---
Please stop posting. Tyvm
---
Thats not... What I want
---
You don't have to spam it. You can let NEAR 2 tell you when someones near from intel the intel is just worse now. Pretty sure some corps also have someone watch the gate in your pocket while doing krabbing activities I know several null corps who have done that.
---
Shocking though you get rewarded for playing the game instead of not playing it.
---
hey - you guys are there too, just saying
---
Umbrella was down due to the deployment. Retards gonna reet.
---
The fight isnt the part where I beat the target, the part where I catch someone who doesn't want to be caught is. There is a lot of strategy that happens before anyone points or scrams a target. If you just go out and cast your net, sure you may occasionally catch some dumb guy who is making a mistake, but go catch a competent pilot who doesn't want to be caught instead and you'll find you need to be quite creative and dynamic in your tactics.

&gt;CAPITAL BRAWLS:

&gt;1.    YOU BAIT
---
2.    ENEMY CAP JUMP
---
3.    YOU RECON DECLOAK
---
4.    YOU RECON LIGHT CYNO
---
5.    YOU DICTOR BUBBLE UP

6.    YOU CAPITAL JUMP
---
7.    ENEMY COUNTER DROPS WITH SUBCAPS       
---
8.    ENEMY DROPS BIG SHIPS ^(Your real target)         
---
9.    YOU DROP THE DREADS               
---
After cyno changes :          
---
* Recon dies to fast - you don't bring even half of your dread fleet       
---
* You cyno at safe distance - sabre warps in and bubble cyno spot, dreads are now tackled while enemy super extract or warp to safe distance to kill your dreads easily          
---
* ^(none of above happens on time but you cyno on spot) you warp in your dreads, but they land on the edge of the bubbles, they are to far to point or apply damage or even neut the target. Time that it took let enemy to kill most of the tackle and super is moving out at your position at max speed.

That's the problem. You don't get rewarded. If you did, it would be worth doing.
---
you said most unpopular and i gave that :p
---
I misunderstood what you were going for I guess, I thought your issue was specifically with bombers, not the practice of blopsing specifically
---
Because we don't speak ~~bot~~ chinese here.
---
Why the interdiction maneuvers link on the rorq?
---
Haha seen your ad in English Recruitment not so long ago... That's nice! Hope it tastes well :)
---
Reddit representative - it's shit, people always yelling, you have to deal with disorderly unstable people, no one appreciates your best works, everyone wants to argue, etc...
---
I'm not sure anyone does.
---
Oh you don't get rewarded no isk shows up in your wallet? I think you just don't find it worth the effort to play the game and rat in somethings alpha could do.
---
There's tons of more things you could do for isk like smart bomb farm 6/10s to run which will give you alot more profit then spinning a myrm in hubs. Or running 10/10s.
---
Who knew that basically entry level pve pays shit.
---
T2 prices are still out of whack
---
he totally exposed you bro.
---
Congrats!
---
You can do the cheap P4s with 5 planets. The expensive ones take alot more. 
---
Rule of thumb is generally like one planet per P2, so if a P4 requires like 8 different P2s, you need at least 9 planets (8 P2 planets + Factory planet), and that assumes no dual planet P2s. 
---
If youre in HighSec you could buy P2s and use all your planets for manufacturing P4s, null you could go end to end, WH space might as well just extract since the returns are so high
---
Thanks for proving my point, last serious blow Dec 2016 lmao, ridiculous
---
Wasn't it destroyed and then immediately replaced?
---
You'd think with the importance of PLEX sales and anything related to the store, that something this important lapsing wouldn't have happened.
---
You also have fuck all for straight teeth but ayyyy, we don't go there huh?
---
Bit wrong here.       
---
From personal experience - very often cyno dies so fast, and you land in random spot in system or wait for next cyno.           
---
You are missing the point where you need to gate or mid, usually the only way you can use a dread bomb is when enemy is sure no one is waiting for him.      
---
Dreads are on login screen and you bait.       
---
When enemy took the bait you login your dreads, mid or take 1 gate before you can jump on the enemy.            
---
^(usually the main targets operate just outside the NPC station range)      
---
Remember that we are not talking here about killing single cap with 2 dreads but something that leads to big capital brawl.
---
We are not talking about hunting ratting carriers.
---
I work in IT. I know how easy it is to have a certificate slip through the net if its obscure and not always used...but the main web page? I've never let that expire.

Ironic.
---
Winmatar is the best and most versatile faction in the game. Please stop calling then races, they are factions. 
---
The reason people dont talk much about mini stuff is cuz back in the day they were super op. Rifter glory days anyone? However they got balanced pretty hard. Like really hard. In all it made most mini ships garbage, but a few shone through as viable ships and got play. In recent years ccp has brought back some viability to mini ships but they are no where as good as they use to be.
---
Ah yes, the classic. Expired SSL Cert.
---
Piracy as a form of income. A lot of people get stuck on the notion that you should strive for "fair fights"...but if you aren't one of those types you can make a living playing as what is effectively a pirate in eve. 
---
You need three things in no particular order:
---
1. Lower your monetary expectations. You'll have less money than the sad losers sucking on rocks or shooting red boxes. For your character's age you will effectively be poor. Who gives a fuck? You only need enough money to buy your next ship and those morons sitting on their piles of money will be sharing some of it with you whether they like it or not. 
---
2. You need to be exceptionally patient. Because you're poor, you need to be efficient. You can't afford to trade 50/50 kills vs deaths because if you're losing half the time then you're looting even less often. You need to be the type of person who is comfortable with letting that bait just float on by. You need to be the type who prefers to keep their own ship alive more than get a kill and go down in a fireball for it. 
---
3. You need to be comfortable working alone or with a couple of close friends. Having to split profits too many ways makes it unsustainable. 
---
These three things rely on you having a pretty solid knowledge of pvp in the game. There is a lot more nuance to it but I think if you fit that profile it is the most entertaining way to play the game.
---
People are hunting for krabs since the beginning of eve, if there is nothing to hunt hunters will also die out.          
---
I will say this again.        
---
CCP should put actual work and make eve space more diverse rather than making it more and more flat.
---
Yeah, so the risk isn't worth the reward. Glad you understand.
---
You're too afraid to commit to 50/50 fights, even when the potential kill is greater than the potential loss.
---
hunting frigs, you'd do better fitting rockets instead
---
But i don't want to save them i want to kill them and what is coming to save them.
---
Got this like 30 minutes or so ago. Tried to submit a bug report for it and wouldn't let me.
---
You are never going to be able to boat a fragile recon through multiple bubbles on target now. So  the only thing I can think of is having cyno recons in Super SMAs that ceptor pilots can jump into and light at the center of the brawl. It’s a ghetto solution but it’s something.
---
&gt;Yes you can call me a null bear - even if last time i got a "tick" from ratting around 1-2 years ago and if i login my 'hunter' is logged in first.  
---
you don't have to start your post with lies man
---
I don't understand how the mobile micro jump saves you, you still have to disable siege so you're vulnerable for 2 to 5 minutes? I mean I don't understand how did nobody catch your rorq at least. I understand it's cheap however, and that it's way harder to kill than a simple blinged rattlesnake.
---
Aah I wish I had come up with this, I guess rorq don't spawn the avenger battleships..
---
Yes, those roaming Triglavian recons in highsec were designed to hurt nullseccers too.
---
Oh wait, highsec crabs are just nullsec alts I guess, so you're right.
---
This war seems like a bit of a clusterfuck with neither side really winning or losing. Then again most of my info comes second hand or from reddit which is...less than reliable.
---
So I don't have a video of someone trying to cyno with a recon, because that would be fucking stupid. Since you seem to think it's not, why don't you come up with a video of someone successfully using a recon cyno on field with a cap fleet.
---
I do, however [have a video](https://clips.twitch.tv/VivaciousBlatantPastaKlappa) of someone using a tanked T3C, and taking just a bit more damage then 15% shields without getting everyone in.  I would also like to point out that this was against one of the worst cap fleets I've come across.
---
So maybe don't pretend that you k ow what you are talking about
---
I'm laughing at there being not one but three separate bugfixes in this patch, all from issue reports I opened forgot about (EWar Drones in Graphs; Phoenix damage modifier; Phoenix Siege stacking). Development done right, even as I the user am being an idiot.
---
Its makes black glass implant works for relic sites.
---
Im using the lower tier integrated analyzer with the implant and i rarely lose a relic cans after that. 56 virus strenght are nasty. One shot many remains and rubble can nodes. And surprisingly good chance for the ruin cans.
---
...im doing this with lv 3 archeology skill, and im quite a newb in exploration.
---
I imagine 60 virus strenght wil annihilate even the ruin stuff.
---
The problem is the cost.
---
bees should be allowed to shoot at the worst bees :D
---
I think people hobodreading have even more accounts and will have one or two dedicated haulers
---
&gt;I've seen armor cynos not even break shields when jumping capitals onto supers.
---
Only if the superfleet decided not to shoot it.
---
Don't want to spoil but i am a pirate and i hunt for people to kill them and get their stuff.
---
Yes you will need them in system, propositioned and spare in SMA.
---
I was looking more for miners, but the frigs made for nice targets of opportunity.
---
Then I'll be the new Pablo Escobar
---
The issue is the perfect safety of being near a station
---
Blackout changes, chaos era are just sad. Low effort game balance. Backstab/cheap shot to old player base.
---
They waste time on "bringing new players", new players always based on experience of old nerds giving free lessons. It was too much to give CCP our play time to teach new people how to play.
---
CCP HILMAR sends his regards...
---
Thanks. You do Bob's work.
---
Curious: how much work have you, and do you continue, to put into Pyfa?
---
Do you get donations?
---
quality killmail whoring.
---
A good number of people will still keep krabbing under the new changes. Less oveall people krabbing is good for faucet reduction so you can't refer to it as a problem.
---
I did it with three. Two dreads &amp; one DST/Scanner. Kept the DST and the Astero in one dread, along with a small tower. If you're really frugal you could do it with just two dreads.
---
Which means that European workers also miss out on these so Im all for more USTZ stuff.
---
I love your vids but I just couldn't look at all those wasted XLASB cycles :P
---
Trump: I couldnt get Greenland so I bought the next best thing. I bought the country of Iceland.
---
Trump Aide: Sir you bought the supermarket chain Iceland not the country.
---
Trump: Shh they'll never notice.
---
This is an honest, serious question.
---
How much experience for you have in cap fleets?
---
These are actually 2 really good suggestions!
---
Basically spot on if you want to breakdown Jita as the central trading hub. Certainly a transaction volume-based tax removes Jita as the big central market.
---
StainGuy are you drunk because you're making too much sense!
---
bubbles and points still block
---
so? Wait until they go to a gategrid to kill other wartargets.
---
😂😂😂
---
You sir have earned my up vote.
---
:D. Yes I can spare two hours a day inbetween work and social life for games. Had it way too often that we traveled through half eve just to be told baddies don't show up. Well thank you. I simply can not spent 10 hours per day in that game. Had it way too often that i had to self descruct my ship because we are on the other end of eve and I had to leave.
---
Look at this tag.           
---
For him capital brawl is just tackling a ratting cap and killing it.              
---
For us is people throwing 30+ capitals at each other with subcapitals on grid that potentially escalates to more than 100 caps on grid and subcapital fleets on grid.             
---
You cannot explain this to someone who only assumes that caps are for PVE and fitted in such way.               
---
He have no idea how important is bringing dreads in proper range for capital points or neuts to have the effect.           
---
Why you have spare suicide dictors in your cap and like 2 spare cyno ships considering the fact that you will die before you use them.                    
---
People have no idea how safer umbrellas will become after those cyno changes for brick tanked ratting caps and supers.
---
It was pre blackout tho...
---
eh they ganked my 800 mil hauler the other day, which isn't much to some people sure but was incredibly inconvenient to me since I was trying to get a load of shit out to null. I have nothing against CODE at all, even if they do gank me. Fair game and it was my own fault.
---
(I'm poking for this one)
---
I've been in wspace from the start of apocropha, sounds randomly disappearing so a standard bug for ccp after patches. There was even a bug that added a sound/wiggle when players would initiate warp from another location on the map. 
---
This will be going exactly back the way it was.
---
You are definitely not the only one, and yes it is a good setup. You can however run it perfectly fine on passive regen with a less tanky rorq.
---
It can, but it's the most unfun activity in the game. It's a very very close 3 cycle so you can't make any mistakes whatsoever.
---
&lt;3
---
Sorry but what kind of lack of effort you are saying?         
---
We are talking about nullsec and committing big ships to battlefield.
---
It's only shit ISK/hr when compared to what's possible with a ratting super. I think it's fairly safe to assume that ratting income is a large driver of the Plex price. 
---
Realistically, the Plex price is a measure of;
---
1. how many hours per month the typical nerd is willing to spend ratting in the optimal ratting ship.
---
2. multiplied by the ISK/hr gained in said ship. 
---
When the meta shifts from `Hyperspatial Hels` to `Regen Myrms`, it's only point 2 that significantly changes. Once ratting supers become rare, the market will undergo a correction. Prices of things like Plex will deflate back down. 
---
That'll be the new market equilibrium.
---
Umm yes it is actionable. Maybe not immediate but it shows trends. Whether people take action is another matter.
---
Yep all you need is a recon in each system you want to travel &lt;3
---
I think I've put more than half of my spare time past 6 months. But I was quite motivated to ~do things~. Now that I implemented everything i wanted, 2.10.0 will probably be the last feature-rich release.
---
Now me and Blitz plan to switch to development of experimental fitting tool which we may or may not call pyfa 3 :P
---
As for donations - while I am not in need of anything, feel free to throw isk or two to Kadesh Priestess.
---
Idk, I don't think I would burn a deep spy alt on a world first race.
---
So far I have only lost a thrasher to gankers, and they were Russian gankers.    I know how to move my stuff safely.   
---
Rule 1 - Do not use a freighter through the main pipes.
---
Works for me...
---
So the group with better subcaps gains the advantage in dealing with and controlling those factors.
---
Instead of light jump the most caps in now you have dictors cds recons and support helping to decide the outcome. Sounds like a far more interesting gameplay design to me.
---
Goons are going to downvote this just to make sure such a brilliant idea doesn't make it out.
---
And then I landed at 0 next to you. Awkward.
---
Nobody died
---
Dude, I was using a scout monitoring everything and they still managed to get me. Sometimes shit just does't go your way. That's my only loss to CODE ever and it wasn't in their regular spaces.
---
Most of those fights were bigger than the BR itself.           
---
How long it took for BR to happen? Then all those big fights are happening more often and often.        
---
Sure CCP fucked up with rorquals and injectors but this can be fixed if CCP wants to.
---
It's shit when you compare it to l4s.
---
On a constellation level\*, cynos make Eve pretty flat. 
---
^(\*realistically it's somewhere between constellation and region, but that's too many words.)
---
I love our volunteers. They do a, often thankless, job because of their passion for EVE Online and get too little recognition for it. Them being volunteers and helping out in their free time when they could be doing something productive, like playing EVE on their mains, means that we can´t provide 24/7 help channel coverage.
---
A recent initiative the GM team has been doing is to staff the help channels with GMs when we can. Your tickets take priority though so we´re not getting 24/7 coverage either but I believe we put in the equivalent of a full time staff or two last month.
---
O7 ty sir
---
If you want to hunt miners you'd better fit a bomblauncher and targetpainters. Bombs are the best part about stealthbombers. A Hulk takes a bomb and maybe 2 salvos to kill, takes like 15-30 seconds.
---
I play with the same people for like 8? years now and practically with the same group since i started to play in eve since my 1st corp.             
---
Tbh it is getting more and more quiet on TS and discord.
---
Well some of them are pretty good players.   And there are a number that camp pipes out of the main pipes, for example there is an especially good ganker in Bagodan, he even makes me nervous.
---
All jokes aside, this is incredible footage. Really reminds you of the beauty and wonder of nature. I wonder how much the killmail is worth.
---
They are taking the CHAOS ERA to the next level: *IRL.*
---
What the fuck do you think happens now?
---
Why do you think every major cap fight has numerous subcaps fleets which usually get in system before we bring in capitals?
---
Stop talking out your ass.
---
They could have their team in Atlanta... Oh, nm.
---
You talk a big game where are your brs to show you do any of this shit because I ain't buying it.
---
Sounds fun, do you have a link to a similar fit?
---
Is that because Faction/Deadspace modules have changed in price?
---
I think its not CCP fault making people leave the game. It's problem of miniority taken over majority of EVE.
---
We will see how you enjoy the game next year.
---
Because it's reached a state of stagnation that's boring and slowly kills the game. Without some truly monumental changes the sandbox will stop being a sandbox due to a tiny minority having undisputed, unassailable control over the game.
---
I was saying I got baited big dog.
---
He’s saying you’re an idiot, because you are. Look at the graph. There was a temporary drop but they’re on track to be back above 4m each within just a few weeks at their current price increase rate.
---
No CCP mechanic makes eve flat.      
---
New Eden is big enough to introduce region variation, like WHY we don't have null regions without any capital travel, no cynos no gates locked out for caps?         
---
Why we don't have regions that have special effects promoting usage of some weapon system or tank ?           
---
Areas without any player structures, no local ... no cloacks ....         
---
            
---
... and so on.         
---
Eve can be diverse but CCP only want to make it flat.
---
You can also covert bridge them to a nullified t3c. Either directly into the brawl or somewhere in system, past all the bubbles. 
---
I think they'll have to be treated like interdictors are now, you'll need a steady stream of them on standby to keep escalations going.
---
should have used letsencrypt :)))
---
No you are wrong.           
---
Group that owns the space just got even bigger upper hand.
---
No, it's because drone boat ratting is just shit isk/hour.
---
It was never popular because it was good income. It was popular because it was low risk and required minimal input/attention. Now there's more risk and required more hassle. For the same levels of hassle or risk better isk can be made in literally other area of the game.
---
Do not sell blue loot in Jita. The whole benefit of blue loot is that CCP has auto buys setup so blue loot ALWAYS maintains value. You are selling under market value in jita to flippers who sell to auto buy.
---
You do realise there's no difference between British and American teeth health??
---
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/12054216/Americans-do-not-have-better-teeth-than-the-British-study-concludes.html
---
You just whiten yours to fuck and expect it to get rid of your cavities and missing teeth (it doesn't). Whitening your teeth does not improve the health of your teeth in the slightest, it's purely aesthetic measure, please try to understand this.
---
A lot of WH corps have a "scout gets the loot" rule, so that helps.
---
Rip incursion runners that do the hacking.  There are incursion sites that do the old mechanics and will require to be reactivated until the hack succeeds.
---
Hey again. I just replied to your ticket, hopefully to your satisfaction. If you have any further questions, comments or complaints, reply to your ticket please. I may not see further replies on here.
---
Mining ship btw
---
We might be talking about different things. I'm talking specifically about suicide gankers. Random gate camping dudes in pipe systems are a bit different and they operate very differently.
---
As before: I don't care. Subcap brawls are better than capital brawls.
---
Considering it's not illegal, you'll be more like the new Bayer.
---
Build it with isogen, need to do SOMETHING with it.
---
The Goons lost a Titan. The excitement must have been there.
---
What kind of sites can a vargur do, and at what rate?
---
Or shkreli
---
So thats the idiot that the ping was about
---
I am also talking about suicide gankers, the one in Bagodan is a Tornado specialist and takes down DTS's and T1 haulers, I assume you just did a quick haul in the first available ship and paid for it.
---
Oh come on John at least link your own video :P
---
 https://youtu.be/3kh6L4bmy24
---
Shhhhhh. I think that’s the point lol if u get my drift.
---
I think that Real Life is more important than chasing frigates.
---
something like this:
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/78510971/
---
The High and Midslots look good, but this pilot seems to have pretty low CPU/PG skills so he has a lot of modules to be able to fit bomb/cloak/torps. With decent skills you can change those mods to more Torpedo DPS.
---
The US timezone and AU timezone received zero events.
---
Of course not. Who the fuck hauls nearly a billion in gear in a T1 hauler? They had an effective decloaking plan and there were a lot of them. Would take a very decent pilot to escape that mess.
---
What about doorstopping? During evictions we usually leave a cloaked roller outside a crit hole and just decloak, prop mod on, and crush.
---
Is that a viable security tactic for ratting?
---
GET ME SOMEBODY TO FIRE!
---
Yeah imagine having a gate straight from, for instance, stain to hisec
---
Would be absurd
---
Supers and Lowsec.  Do people put them in Freeport Keepstars, or do they all have dedicated alts that log out in space?  Not talking about Snuff or the big dogs, but the people you hear about solo dropping supers.
---
You would be surprised, idiots and of course people with more ISK then they know what to do with so they don't give a flying feck.
---
How did you miss them with the scout?
---
CCP bans bots in waves so as not to give away what their detection system is, so bots operate for a while after being discovered. This could be a way to cut into their profits between getting found and getting banned
---
Chaos Era Round 3: rip our account management page
---
Why the hell are you bringing the 'krabbing' part here.        
---
It is not about krabing but about capital brawls.              
---
Like krabing will be safer than ever .... less isk generated ^(I always asked for this! ) will lead to people going full tank as they will still make waaaaaaaaay more isk than subcaps that will die now fast.              
---
Umbrella will still work, but you need a recon(s) with respective fax.     
---
Imagine yourself ratting in a HEL, you have free alts ^(extractors)     
---
So you have a shield recon and a fax undocked and waiting.   
---
^(like no one is ratting on 2 supers)      
---
Someone tackles your HEL and if you cannot do much about the tackle ^( 2 smart bombs now ) you decloak your recon, light a cyno jump in fax and start repping your cyno as rest cover jump in.        
---
But wait there are corp people in the system - they also have spare recons if needed.            
---
Damn are you trying to persuade me that it is worth to rat in a super again as i can make decent ISK in much safer way?
---
I messaged them on FB and they clearly didn't bother to check, just sent back, try a different browser or incognito mode
---
two browsers, same response and it appears OP used a different one again and got the same
---
Yep.
---
This is fine. The cert council is all out on vacation. This is totally normal for the whole department to be out and nobody to be covering because it's actually vacation season and only dumb Americans like me wouldn't understand. - /r/eve yesterday.
---
For real though it's **CHAOS ERA**.
---
Sure they are i also love them.        
---
But brawl is when both sides fight and not when one side is in kite ships.                 
---
Eve is big enough to have both things.
---
You forgot in above list: no avenger spawn and better application.
---
I don't get it?        
---
Maybe i will explain.      
---
If i fight at your home area i need to move ships by gates or jump in.   
---
The moment you kill of all tackle or all logis - you are having upper hand as you can disengage or overtake the battlefield.       
---
Pilots of those dead ships are podded out and need to move back that takes a lot of time.                 
---
If someone is attacking me in my home area whenever i die i land near or even in the same system, have all stuff needed for reshipping.         
---
I also have all the support from people around.
---
Works now: [https://i.imgur.com/NIV6sFu.png](https://i.imgur.com/NIV6sFu.png)
---
Looking at the date certificate has been issued, I'd say that either forgot to upload this new certificate issue or there was some kind of caching issue
---
You're right, and that's why my WH orgs primary doctrine is based around armor Brawling. But the problem in null is that there are two basic types of Brawling. Sub-cap brawl, and capital brawls. The cyno changes make it so that both of these are possible, whereas before a true large subcap brawl was just not possible because getting yourself tangled up in close was a one way ticket to hotdrop town.
---
The change is a good thing, because it allows, with proper planning, for smaller groups to engage with larger groups by keeping the extreme cost extreme power ships off the grid.
---
There is risk.
---
People just dont like that people work together to return that risk to hunters
---
Roaming triglavian recons can be dealt with if you do not afk for 23 hrs/day
---
just imagine the one IT guy who didn't get his vacation approved, on his knees begging the low energy phone supporter at Comodo (or wherever they get their certs) while the heavy steps of hilmar echo through the corridor, coming closer and closer.
---
Of course you like it... [taking pictures is an active experience](https://fstoppers.com/news/study-shows-taking-photos-increases-persons-enjoyment-experiences-under-certain-180355) that requires thinking about the scene. People who take pictures when traveling report much higher levels of enjoyment from travel than people who don't. 
---
You know who doesn't like taking nice screen shots? a bot. 
---
otoh 
---
&gt; This effect is less likely to occur when taking photos of an experience that is already engaging at a high level...
---
Fine then. Don't use Regen Myrms. Use a different subcap that gives higher ISK/hr. 
---
Point remains. When the meta shifts from using supers to rat, to using the next FOTM subcap to rat, people will spend the same length of time ratting. The ISK/hr changes accordingly. Then the Plex price follows afterwards.
---
This is a really good answer, loot from my solo or small gangs kills makes a decent part of my income (yes, I'm dirt poor aswell, but have more than enough to have fun playing the game).
---
It could be better, but I don't meet the criteria stated in point "2.", explosions are pretty even if it's my own ship doing it and I just can refrain from taking the bait to see what happens or engaging fights against the odds if I'm getting bored.
---
Unpopular career: Market Re-lister
---
Feat. CAPF :thinking: they literally were able to desiege dreads and get them out, pretty sure your bomber fleet was insignificant. Should be Feat. DPCI lmao
---
empty mid/low/rig slots is like putting only 3 wheels on your car. you might be able to drive but it definetly works better with 4 wheels.
---
so try to ''fill'' them up. a target painter, or even two to make sure your torps apply better would be an idea...
---
Oh no, I can't bait cruisers and drop my carrier on them any more boohoo.  If you can't fight half a dozen nano ships without dropping caps you are shit anyway.
---
1) it's more "fun" to hate those at the top. 
---
2) If wormholers REALLY believed all the bullshit they're sperging all over reddit on what mechanics they want to hunt under, they'd hunt other wormholers more than null because it has all their "desired" changes.  But... they don't.  Because they don't REALLY want the changes theyre spewing
---
Everyone wants "risk" for nullsec.  But only when the risk applies to enemies they are shooting.  They want to safely be able to roam and kill easily and freely, and anything that counters them is "unfair" and "too safe"
---
Ignore the rhetoric. Trust me you'll be happier in the long run
---
Ty logibros for repping the website.
---
A krab that eats other krabs is still a krab
---
🤯
---
It is dangerous.  People are just mad as hell that the "risk" is two ways. 
---
You want to shoot ships and them NOT to defend themselves?  Go gank hisec.
---
I'd like to see some sort of double confirmation system, or better visual indicators of the terms of a trade having changed. Really not a fan of most direct trade scams since they seem to mostly be a result of the UI rather than some kind of clever social engineering.
---
Can the 30 minutes be spent by a spirit healer with a visible countdown in the spirit realm?  
---
And you can also fly around in the ghosty spirit realm to scout for your next kill attempt?
---
It sounds like something ive seen in another game....
---
BEER IN A SODASTREAM???
---
Not going to name any groups, but small gang PVP all the way!
---
I don't think he was asking what it meant. I suspect he was exclaiming about how stupid the statement is. Or at least I hope he was because it is totally stupid.
---
Bubbles will block your ability to warp in recon to the battlefield (aka place where you light the cyno on some dread).          
---
Jumping in dreads 50KM from the target is bad ... but you will not get it closer.
---
How are your cruising missiles' precision 233m? It's a stupid question but it's bugging me, I only get 280m on the last pyfa version.
---
No, they won't use the next fotm subcap, because subcap isk/hour is shit. They will move out of null and/or to other activities.
---
He killed ratting capitals and for him those are cap brawls ........
---
Cry me a river that all these nullbears who have been krabbing for years and have made way too many rorq/Titans/supers, are now crying that the imbalance they had achieved is now being aggressively counter balanced.
---
The difficulty of modern day PvE is grossly overstated.
---
Lot's of null people have been moving to null actually. Been great!
---
This blackout is really helping people realize the fun of living in whs. Hope it continues forever.
---
Thanks again for an awesome tool
---
Not only super fleet, but also subcaps.     
---
In bigger fight a recon will not last long against subcapital fleet, especially if it try to light the cyno in a proper spot.            
---
Sure you can warp in recon and drop your dreads 50km from the targets ......   
---
At this range it is better to use carriers for better damage .....
---
Probably the safest thing u can do
---
....yeah I just walked in and I'm still confused by all the anger and downvotes. It was obviously a joke, but people are mad they didn't get the joke? Or are people mad because it's not real? I dunno but this is some of the most autistic shit I've seen on r/eve.
---
It happens to the best lol
---
That has nothing to do with this though. In fact letsencrypt's free certificates expire after 3 months whereas most other certificates are usually valid for a year or longer
---
That's BFA. WoW Classic is kind of that but you don't stand in one spot hitting a queue button.
---
Wtb WoTLK tia.

thomas lear in the flesh
---
1. If you can get 1 ship through you can get them all through. Cynos don't have lines. Your fleet can be en route before enemies lock on.
---
&gt;A corp can never have enough \[..\] logi pilots!
---
Unless it's a smalls scale pvp corp. Where you often only want 0 to 1 logis
---
Sure, so have more ships.
---
Agreed.
---
So make a point?
---
They had to leave the pos bc ccp removed on grid boosting. The excavators being multiboxable was the real error. They should have used fighter mechanics (which ccp hinted at initially).
---
but then you would be asking people at CCP to work at like 11pm - 4am? be reasonable
---
Sure.
---
And even the recent super and dread battle with sniff had cynos survove just fine.
---
You can also use multiple cynos to reduce the risk of losing your active cyno.
---
Oh no, you have to bring more than 1 ship now
---
Ok answer me on this simple question :                 
---
Why WH groups are mostly looking for fights outside of WH space?
---
Yeah, wait until they do that in their 20b isk abyssal/officer tanked ship.
---
A) Your own tank fails hilariously fast against their blistering damage output. You immediately die.
---
B) You cant break their tank and you die a bit slower.
---
C) You are slowly breaking their tank, but they hold out long enough to deagress and gate jump
---
OR
---
D) You are slowly breaking their tank, but they hold out long enough for eight of their equally blinged out gang-mates to arrive and push in your shit.
---
(At least you dont have to deal with neutral rep alts anymore.)
---
The OPs point is, allowing HS booshing removes the cowardly retreat options and forces them to actually risk those ridiculous fits rather than fighting mostly risk-free encounters.
---
The automod bot is currently a little broken and not is not updating the OP to show the modified discord link.
---
The correct discord link is: https://discord.gg/tWeMAek or you can use the perma link: animeistrash.org/eve
---
Just because GOTG decided not to shoot the in-cyno doesn't mean that someone with more experience would make that same decision.
---
How many cap fights have you been in. I don't mean ganking krab caps, I mean actual fights?
---
I honestly would love to see all that shit too. 
---
Constellations that change the effectiveness of certain module attributes. For example, cap-batteries were better but provided no neut resistance. AB's with reduced mass-addition, but higher cap consumption. 
---
Whatever weird shit you want. 
---
Hell, if you want to [turn it up to eleven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMSV4OteqBE#t=1m18s) and make constellations change the effectiveness of *skills*. Medium Autocannons need some love? Well they get it in X constellation over there where `Medium Projectile Turret` gives +6% damage per level.
---
They will happen as soon asset safety is removed from game and deplictable resources are introduced. 
---
The null empires will turn in to nomads or at least they will have to send "expeditions" to assault the neighbours garden to bring back the resources they need and want.
---
Wormhole space cannot hold the population of nullsec that would like to live in a dangerous area. also.  your taking points from everyone, some DO want supercaps but want danger, some want loot from structures but dont want the logistical annoyance of WH's?
---
And suddenly that's going to change dramatically?
---
It rarely happens now.
---
They will feed soon enough
---
Apparently more than some people here, otherwise all these people have been f1 monkeys that know nothing of how to actually play the game.
---
These changes clearly change it to how it should be.
---
It shouldn't ever have been move a solo super tanked ship in and then have your entire fleet there with no counterplay.
---
Cynos should be able to die, you should need to bring in more than 1 ship to get shit started.
---
Is it shit because it's too small, or is it shit because it was earned while flying a subcap? 
---
If it's too small, explain why it's too small.
---
Yeah, so the set up should take more effort than fly in one ship and have your whole fleet there no problem.
---
It works both ways. It's not always 'people looking for a fair fight get capitals dropped on them'. People blobbing someone can get in and get out unchallenged so no fight happens at all.
---
It's also really inconvenient requiring a pretty large character overall depending on how your alts are set up to cyno around. Most agree that cyno's were a bit too strong, but this particular way of changing them hurts some things it wasn't intended to (Things like cyno vigils as well). 
---
Giving a deployable cyno structure anyone can launch that takes time to turn on would solve this. 
---
Lot's also feel that this isn't going to fix the issues eve faces and may even hurt it considerably. Personally I think this is an extremely lazy way to fix a problem and they could have done better. A problem is fixed, sure, but it's really hodge podge.
---
This is the story of my Eve experience. I quit the game in 2013. At that time I was primarily trading in HS and LS, and the item I traded most reliably was isogen. I usually bought it at about 120ISK, and could sell it for 250 elsewhere.  I had stockpiles of it all around the cluster. When I decided to win Eve for a while, I didn't liquidate it because I figured when I came back years later, maybe it would be worth a lot more. Cut to 2018, when I returned to Eve to find out my billions in isogen were worth a few hundred million. That was the day I found out what a rorqual is, and lot of other things that have happened in the meantime.
---
But they AREN'T.
---
They are lower.
---
So why would it change?
---
I just yesterday thought about how great the universe background in EVE is looking due to them using Hubble-Observatory-Pics as inspiration for them. Went from Curse up to Venal, and the variety is stunning
---
We usually assume people abide by rules when discussing balancing, right?     
---
Enforcing those rules is a different subject.
---
So then this opens up more strategy?
---
Sounds nice.
---
Not in the business of making wormhole life easier.
---
Makes it a lot harder to get folks to do that. They really ought to just add deployable cyno's or a cyno module any ship can use that takes a minute to turn on or something. Or simply a 'firework cyno' module, display only.
---
Upon further inspection authorities found that neither the miners nor the avatar had a mining permit, which is in clear violation of the CODE. The bandits were brought to justice by law abiding agents.
---
You circumvented the alpha restrictions?
---
you cant seriously be this simple?   ITS ALWAYS A GOON lol
---
You have no freaking idea how the LP Shop items work, do you?
---
Buy a 5 run BPC and be happy. 3000 ISK per LP are easy just check https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/lpstore/
---
Why don’t you take a gander at complex reactions and t2 hulls?
---
I suppose you got those Cutting Edge achivements to back that up?
---
Gotta love that highsec ore mining is now worthless.
---
all you do is sell stuff and get isk you dont print them with mining
---
its the same as ship loss
---
moste ppl think losing a ship gets money out of the game...
---
I can, for example Imperial Navy EANM sell like hot cake just check Jita volume and they are many more similar items.
---
I personally love rolling fleets out of thera once they get into delve. 
---
“You’re locked in here with me”
---
wow, you are.
---
When asset safety is removed big blocks will farm those few small independent groups that still survived until people quit or join some block.                      
---
Infinite resources ... well they still be infinite, as game will die without them ... **so they will respawn after a day, week , month , year?** ... no year is to long, month also probably to long - CCP want people getting monthly sub and if for the next 30days they don't have any income ... well.........pvers will quit.      
---
Hell imagine yourself having it linked to DT :D this will be amusing.        
---
AUTZ  or late USTZ login ... and there is nothing left for them.         
---
But assuming a month.          
---
Resources are re spawning in a month - so you strip all resources in a system, move to next one ... basically you need enough systems just to cycle activities so in a month the 1st system will be replenished by ingame mechanics.                     
---
So you just cycle your group over some area ...
---
we want a detailled BR "Sparkly vs cake"
---
No, the one hes talking about was prior to the deployment
---
You are constantly using arguments that can apply only at this 'ratting carrier' level.
---
WH corps actually look for both. WH orgs just send out hunters through their chain, and if they find a null hole, they can poke their head out and see where they are, and check dotlan to see if there's activity nearby. The reason a WH group is more likely to fight in null than in a WH has nothing to do wth prefference and everything to do with intel. If I drop into null, I have information on everything around me and can take a fleet 15 jumps to to a fight. You can't do that un WH space, you have to scout systems one at a time.
---
"People like different things than me, I am upset."
---
Think hard... 
---
Put the correct hardener on and use short range tracking ammo and you are golden.
---
My org most WH corps actually look for both. WH orgs just send out hunters through their chain, and if they find a null hole, they can poke their head out and see where they are, and check dotlan to see if there's activity nearby. The reason a WH group is more likely to fight in null than in a WH has nothing to do wth prefference and everything to do with intel.

---
Because not everyone sucks at cap fights.
---
Look, you're clearly 1337sMaLLGanG brain, so let me break this down from a fundamental standpoint.
---
So right now, the way we get in grid with another supercap/cap fleet, is we use a nullified T3C or inty (or both, or several of each) to position a primary cyno.  That shit lights, and if we usually get a couple of dreads or faxes or something through before it gets blapped, and one of those caps light a hard cyno everyone else comes through.
---
Now there are a couple of situations where the primary cyno might live. 
---
The dudes holding my the field might want us to come in because they want a fight, so to let it live.
---
They might be stupid, and just not think to kill it
---
They might not see it because of tidi until enough shit gets through that they are more focused on killing caps, then a stupid cyno.
---
Whatever the case may be, if that cyno lives, it's only because the cap fleet didn't shoot it, if they do, it instapops, just like in the video I linked earlier.
---
Whether the initial cyno lives or not, we can still get on field because we got backup cynos on field. The change is taking those back up cynos away.
---
So basically, just because something worked once, or even twice, or fuck, even most of the time, doesn't mean you can plan on it.
---
Ya I couldn't figure out why that was happening!
---
You're right the Daredevil killtime has to be beaten yet.
---
True but to be honest, a lot of people in null will have skills to pilot a cov ops for bombers or just for moving around in null. Wouldn't think it will be that big of a problem.
---
Then again I don't really agree with the cyno changes as they way too restrictive. If you want to stop caps from cynoing fine, but at least I think other ships like T3Cs should also be able to cyno (they can cov cyno already, why not regular cyno?). But if CCP really really wants this change, I guess a firework cyno module would be nice as well.
---
Each to his own but with this fit you won't be faster than using the Wolf and that beats my intention of using the Nergal. You want a faster killtime.
---
No, it close off way more strategy then it opens.
---
What, exactly, does it open up as far as strategy goes that isn't currently possible, and pretty much proven not to work.
---
Also, how many cap fights have you been in? You clearly don't know shit about how they work.
---
Isogen was the one that got hit the worst, more than a 90% drop
---
because we don't like shitposting in reddit, its boring and useless
---
Because interacting between wormhole groups often doesn't get published on Reddit, as most wormholers have there own channels to talk to 1 and other.
---
So the idea that all they do is fight in k-space is a bit of selection bias.
---
Bring more cynos, have your ships ready to jump. Be fast.
---
None of those require a whaling situation.
---
injectors are a golden goose for ccp from a business perspective. not so much from a gameplay perspective though.
---
adam4eve, it's awesome
---
How many?
---
Link a battle report with caps and you on it.
---
i havent look in a while, but is pyerite still cheaper than tritanium?
---
would need to see all the minerals in a chart from 2014 to make a better decision,
---
So bring multiple cynos.
---
Adapt or die.
---
ratting does generate a more constant high level of income.
---
compared to Moon mining with a rorq, the rorq is WAAAY more isk/hr but not as consistant as you need good moons non stop. in anoms rorqs only earn a little less constant isk /hr.
---
Frigate Burner missions generate the most isk/hour that i know of. more than a rorqual on an r64 (infact i think theyre pretty evens depending on how fast the burner mission runner can be.)
---
Plex price isnt affected by nothing more than 1.demand and [2.how](https://2.how) much spare money ALL people have, including miners, burner missions, level 5 mission runners everyone.
---
The recent changes will see a drop in plex prices, a small amount of this will be angry pvpers who cant handle the no local risk get scared so they stop plexing accounts, or stop buying plex to pvp.
---
Another small amount of this will be super alts or carrier ratting alts etc being sold, unsubbed etc. 
---
The biggest affect on plex prices will be the 1000's of rorqual alts being sold due to extra danger. this will push plex prices down, and minerals up. eves economy is pretty large scale. so im not sure how much itll notice, but it will do that.
---
How much money is made isnt the only factor, the amount of people willing to purchase plez from CCP is huge also. if people are unhappy, less plex, price increase. the mining era was shite and many quite or took a break.
---
I just hope the irony isn't lost on you
---
Depending on the raid cycle, yes. My wife does to. She clicks her spells.
---
It brings up smaller scale engagements.
---
Because now not everything will be a 100% cap escalation.
---
&gt; Booshing is now allowed in Highsec.  
---
&gt;\[...\]  
---
&gt; How long until highsec wardec alliances implode? 
---
I think you meant to ask **how long until highsec wardec alliances inject into PVP Skiffs?**
---
Fastest I've seen a hole cleared to date are the Russians that live in the few C6 red giants. They'll drop 3-6 smartbomb rorqs onto a site and kill it in minutes and finish the rest with drones. They can krab an entire hole faster than I've ever seen, it's a sight to behold. I've only seen them even die like once or twice and o can't think of anything that could possibly match their idk per hour. Of course they're limited by site spawn but I would think one guy multiboxing could make 5b+ an hour.
---
It’s how I do it, but I keep my alts at roughly 0 with tats. So there are probably other ways. I’m also not a big name guy though
---
You really don't have much experience in this.           
---
You login in dreads waiting for someone to take the bait - some people login slower ... like you get black screen for 20s, you get this for some reason sometimes.                
---
Dreads need to mid and jump a gate as target is not within direct range and you cannot pre position dreads as enemy have eyes on you.                     
---
You jump in dreads - they need to wait the timer, regain cap and jump a gate ...            
---
Ofcourse few dreads land at each other and cannot warp as fast as they bump from each other.                        
---
You cannot cyno in those dreads at the same time you need multiple cynos as you need constant flow of them .              
---
We are also talking about simple situation where there is no one trying to tackle your dreads, you don't need to clear one of the gates.    
---
What you are saying is possible only if you jump directly from dread staging - but as people are aware of the ranges they usually are not willing to escalate at this point.
---
Use an ECM support ship at range to prevent yourself being locked.
---
Use range damps to prevent him getting locked.
---
I am off time zone so I'm not able to participate in the event unfortunately.  However, I want to thank CCP and the Devs for a new desktop wallpaper!
---
looks like you dont understabd economics and only can throw out insults ^^
---
The subs killed dics and bombed/jumped off bubbles + put like 3-4 dreads worth of dps on field.
---
if you cannot see that the saying 'printing money' refers to the fact the minerals mined have a value and can be sold for isk your as dumb as i say you are.
---
i thought you was kidding when you did not realize this.
---
im pretty sure i can guess why you think so, but PLEEASE explain why you think ship deaths does not remove money out from the games economy?
---
Did you add the script?
---
Use range damps in conjunction with long ranged Ecm to achieve similar effect.
---
Also fitting a dedicated tank ship with an ecm mod helps your polarized buddy to apply for longer.
---
Just get a bit creative!
---
Why does the way letsencrypt help you with auto renewal not have anything to do with expired certs?
---
Anyhow, letsencrypt / certbot is probably not good for companycerts. What do I know. 
---
Do you think I should have added more smileys indicate it was not a super serious post?
---
And Mexico is going to mine it!

Yep, even with implants it doesn't go that low. I know it's not important but still..

Nice bait post but.... will be irrelevant once u can’t bait with that cruiser
---
I mean if you want to make the stretch to me being a goon then go for it, it won't be the most retarded thing you've ever done :D
---
lmao

They have no experience with anything else :/
---
Since you're the living embodiment of the [Dunning-Kruger affect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) in action, let me spell it out for you:https://i.imgur.com/mahfgDY.png
---
At current rate of plex recovery, it will be back to the price it was, before the blackout began, sometime within the next 1-2 months.
---
"Danger" means "I should be able to kill you with no risk to myself."
---
That's what you hope is going to happen, but there is absolutely no reason to believe that's actually going to happen.
---
What will happen is a race to get supercaps and n grid, and whoever does, will win that timer uncontested, just like it works now if we can't get a cyno in grid.
---
Link a battle report of you dying as a cyno and your fleet not all making it through.
---
And then bring more cynos.
---
They only nerfed the range, nothing else. The only reason to complain about this patch is when your sweet Barghest-semi-AFK-Multibox is now useless ...
---
Welllllllll to combat big blocks that start to blob u gotta be able to go fast and sometimes they bring too much logi so u gotta bounce. And let’s be honest, I’m disengaging when goons drop all those caps on my 6 man cruiser gang. I’m killing your tackle if I can and I’m warping out.
---
Blackout
---
I thought we were talking about full capital brawls, not dropping a dread fleet on a tiny super group
---
Just what guided bombs do.. If your too quick they can have a hard time tracking
---
THEN MAKE AN ARGUMENT.
---
One of the few things Pyfa was lacking in: its dps graph compared to EFT's. And you mostly solved that issue, great work!
---
Sure. Cal CV 5 and Recon skills will apply to many great ships. 
---
With ecm changes. Its a pair of rare ships that still can do great supporting roles! Ignore the salt and fly what interests you the most.
---
The scavenger hunt going on today in Gallente space, how do I find loot? By scanning things in Gallente space the same way I scan down cosmic signatures?
---
It MAY, it HASN'T
---
Statement of fact: Plex are cheaper now than pre blackout.
---
Are you saying this is false?
---
When I assume there will be deplictable resources. They are that: deplictable. 
---
When you waiste a R64 moon to the ground. The next respawn will not be equivalent to a R64 again. Might be might NOT be. It will be random. The "R64 MOON CHUNK THAT YOU MINED IN DELVE" in hours could have respwanned in OASA region 30 days later. 
---
The amount of R64 will always be the same in game but the distribution across the map would be random.
---
The concept makes sense. When your are exploring an oil field. It will eventually dry up. It will not respawn. You have to go to other area to try to find more oil.
---
So it'll take a bit of effort?
---
But if you don't get elite killmails theres no point
---
Well, there was that whole thing where out dumbasses tried to cyno with an atron, and a bunch of nightmares ended up at the sun, but that wasn't caps.
---
We don't just jump supercaps into fights unless we are confident we can get everyone in. It's kinda hard to set that up, but it is what it is.
---
&gt;And then bring more cynos.
---
So N+1?
---
Also, since you don't seem to realize this, but just feeding recons is shitty gameplay.
---
money only git out by isk sinks link market tax everything else is only shifting money around
---
you cant print isk with mining you only shift existing isk into your Account thats only a minor problem ( i know rich become even nore rich and
---
 stuff like this)
---
but the real problem is inflation
---
mining only makes one guy a bit more rich but it dont have any efffect how much 1 isk is worth
---
sorry for my bad englisch
---
contract it to an alt and just forget about it. thats what i do when my assetlist gets too big
---
The ppl in WHs are usually watching more closely than the avg fleebag with extra chromies in null eating hot pockets and giggling about his dank ticks bruh. With the new blackout it’s easier to kill them if you’re willing to look for them. Also most of the cool targets are behind acceleration gates now. It’s satisfying to get the rattlesnake, macharial, or tengu doing escalations and not rly paying attention to d scan. This used to be nearly impossible because they’d start watching d scan when u came in local. Now u get to wait for them to get comfy.
---
You do understand the groups hunting in delve have 23/7 content very little formup time or moving involved. When you fight the blob you dont have to worry about finding content.
---
Why on earth would anyone outside goons mine it? Is mexico now a shitty nullsec territory where people are forced to krab at titan-point?
---
You need to invest in a travel fit for your kestrel. Nanofiber internal structure II, lots of shields, and inertial stabs. Carry your normal fit in your cargo, and switch back to it when you get where you are going. This should let you moon walk past the baddies on gate.
---
its flavor is gravel, miners favorite   
---
miner btw
---
Like... asset window, mark all, right click &amp; select "Thrash it"?
---
Or make public contracts for cheap.
---
Or ask the frogs to haul it, if it's not expensive.
---
Or donate them to a corp that owns the place. That's what I did.
---
It wil never happen.
---
Because the big guy will always doing more than the small guy.
---
N+1 rules.
---
Not sure if this is a thread I can ask for fits in but..
---
I Found myself a quiet little space of low sec with very little traffic. Looking for a good pve fit for ded 3/4’s. Preferably either stratios or legion.   Maybe I’m paranoid so I won’t list which rats I’m up against &gt;.&gt;
---
?Wat? Idk, where you need fast align time for pointing one of the least agile ships in game (freighter) that always (except on region gates) appears within range of even the cheapest meta point, even when you sit at 0 on gate. So I dont know .... maybe I should hold your vodka?
---
Is it all in one place or all over? Making firesale contracts works, takes some time but they do get bought.
---
E) bait, have friends ready to warp in
---
You are missing something.
---
&gt;So given all of this, what is "too safe"?
---
&gt;What is "danger"?
---
&gt;and what do you want to happen by changing these to your liking?
---
Keep these sentences, delete the rest.

a simple "no" would have been enough.
---
You don't really have the relevant experience to make an argument, because if you knew shit, there would be no argument. This is like trying to argue that the sky is blue to a blind person.
---
Seriously. The only people trying to defend your point are people who don't fly supercaps, aren't in cap fleets, and thing all anyone does with their caps is krab.
---
Anyone know knows shit knows this change is bad for legit, blockwar cap fights.
---
I don't understand why you are so desperately trying to nerf those. They have nothing to do with you. You aren't in them, we don't have them in your space, they literally have zero impact on your game, just like hole rolling hictors had zero impact on my game.
---
Huh, idk if OP edited their post or said it in a comment but I don't see it there? That would explain the difference though.
---
This one statement tells everything about statistics and how it works. If u are blindly looking at numbers/graphs without getting into details you will most likely fail.
---
The best part is that the Rorqs could Panic and wait out the 5 minutes that the supers had to delay at the midpoint to ride out fatigue, but a solo titan can't.
---
You clearly should work for CCP, because they also think its a good idea to hurt their player base to combat boting, only to have next to no impact on the bot's and a massive nerf to the players.
---
contract it to ~~an alt~~ **ME** and just forget about it. thats what i do when my assetlist gets too big
---
Okay, why will recons die all the time every time but right now cynos rarely die even when subcaps with no reps?
---
erm, ihubs dying is progress.
---
english is fine, i understand what you are saying, but you dont understand it completely.
---
When a ship dies. the isk spent to buy ship and modules that die is lost. this takes the isk they spend and gives it to the miners (who mined the stuff to make ship)
---
It is referred to isk printing as the miners MAKE MONEY from thier time. you are correct it does not put isk into the economy but it still can be referred to isk printing.
---
ratting, missions and insurance are the ones that actually put the isk into the game. the ones that lower the value of 1isk the more it is done.
---
Not n+1 at all, just critical mass to disrupt the ability to cyno snipe.
---
Somehow cynos live now, and they don't have orders of magnitude more who than recons.
---
Trained Dev Linguistics - V
---
Cloaked suicide gankers are apparently a thing. I warped through with the scout. Noone there. Came through with my hauler, three battle cruisers ready to gank. 
---
Was pretty clever of them and not sure how the fuck they set that up. Maybe cloaked waiting for an obvious scout? Decloaked upon seeing gate fire? That's my guess.
---
You should post this same question in the ED reddit to get a better idea of the strengths and weaknesses of each game. r/eve is obviously going to be biased towards eve.
---
Clearly you're not a stable genius who has the vision to see the value in beautiful, clean isogen.
---
This was fixed in todays patch notes. /u/murkar . 
---
* Reverting the default for copying text from a text field back to be without formatting due to player feedback. Copying with formatting is possible through a right click menu when some text is selected.
---
When do they not die, other then in the instances I pointed out in the other post?
---
I really try hard not to insult people on Reddit, but you're actually acting dumb as fuck.  I've answered every question you're asking already.
---
So you say cynos purely survive off the grace of the opposing FC?
---
Then why are recons being weaker changing anything?
---
&gt;e+iso=lots of trit/mex would be dank
---
This is the dumbest thing I think anyone has ever posted here.
---
It doesn't matter how the certificates are created/who the certificates are from if you don't set it up correctly. Which seems to be the case here otherwise we wouldn't have seen this error :p
---
So do I, the keyword regarding this issue would be "Monitoring".
---
sure, but its still absurdly not risky. In the end it was a bug though, and bugs get fixed eventually.
---
And you know he'll never freaking switch when you really need a logi.
---
Subcaps can't kill fast enough to generate the isk/hour to make it a more worthwhile activity compared to other options.
---
How is "bring more cynos" not the definition of N+1?
---
If I have N number of cynos, and I need to bring more cynos, the first step in bringing more cynos would be to bring one more cyno, at which point the number of cynos I have would be.....
---
N+1
---
You keep saying cynos don't die now. That doesn't make it true.

If there´s an easily accessible and efficient way to play in the sandbox measured against time and effort invested it will ultimately become the dominant and ubiquitous playstyle. At that point the sandbox is dead. This isn´t about safety and/or danger or how the different groups or individuals percieve such things.
---
At least we're getting there again.
---
No, my guess is they used this wildcard certificate as a short-term solution. Normally on public facing webapps/sites you don't use wildcard certs, always certs for that specific app/site/purpose.
---
Just because everyone has access to the same ships, does not make the mechanic better.
---
From a game mechanic point of view, **current** implementation of local, cloacking and instant teleportation is just not very engaging.
---
Very interesting....now can I have your stuff? Please :)
---
&gt;ull swing. And that's because the price of isogen was already low and dropping further. It's been a thing since the earlie
---
The price of heavy water in delve is good. The price of every harvestable ore or ice product in delve is good. Unless, I guess, you are the one mining it.  For people who build things though...
---
You may not realize this, but a capital ship has quite a bit more EHP then a recon, or even a blops, and actually has a chance of living long enough to get most of the fleet, or at least another hard cyno in.
---
You can't actually be this dumb. You're trolling at this point, right?
---
tbf sometimes they are
---
they only thing broken with mining its way to afk if you cant multibox rorquals it will bee ok
---
so i totaly confirm with a single person get ritch by mining but its not the biggest problem
---
isk inflation is a way bigger problem and skill injectors too
---
The thing hurts most is this was preventable, I saw manticore and astero in dscan 2 or 3 times seperately but I thought I could 1v1 a manticore or an astero. When manticore landed on grid while I was in a relic site, I got baited pretty bad and engaged. Then astero and stratios decloaked I went Afk and had a existential crisis
---
We'll see how it goes... I think the changing any minds phase is over tho
---
not the op but im assuming so its easier to get scrams on the drifter since they warpoff if you dont hold em
---
The sun
---
&gt;ove that highsec ore mining is now worthless.
---
Correct. This just in, CCP just announced they are fixing the game by turning everything into a wormhole and removing all ores from the game. No changes to industry build requirements though. 
---
This was to nerf Delve; unfortunately, our stockpiles of minerals will last at the present rate of consumption for 600 years.
---
What stupid fucking world that you live in is losing uncontested timers because someone else alarm clocked earlier then you either effort, or good?
---
Are you using a random word generator to reply? This shit doesn't even make sense.
---
Classic wow does start at level 1. Its only much later that the game started being built solely around the idea of players being max level all the time.
---
Bummer. I usually empty my hold every 100m ISK or so in any high-sec station I can find.
---
I would love it if a Recon could tackle a Supercapital.
---
Get out of the kestrel and into a destroyer you will do things much faster. Imo train into a jackdaw asap and just burn those missions down
---
CCP reinvented it and overshot.
---
Because, three reasons:
---
1. Wormholes should be the only legitimate way to play the game;
---
2. In wormholes, people tend to have friends and small gangs run into small gangs. Too risky. The goal is to make *null sec* into a no risk hunting ground where 8 bombers have enough time to gank a super;
---
3. Duh.
---
i'll pay jita buy -10% for HS and -15% Low sec, message me here if you want to take me up on it. But i am afk until tomorrow.
---
Honestly I’m happy there are still bots during the blackout. They’re so much easier to kill and u can literally do it all day with your friends pretty easily if u want to. They don’t make much money either.
---
I just manually reviewed each of the titans lost in that fight and none of them have been reimbursed.
---
I'm pretty sure the source for this claim has a fairly liberal relationship with the truth.
---
I used to carry a small secure container around with me. Anchored at a safe for when the loot piles up and I wanted to keep going.
---
Thanks to all the folks who have worked on this project. It’s an invaluable tool for the community.
---
Firesale it. Copypaste the items from assets into evepraisal, look at total value, contract the entire pile for around 80% of its price, higher or lower depending on your patience.
---
the "liquidation service" is essentially other people looking to flip your assets for their income. There's plenty of people doing that, it just depends on what, where and how much of the total value you want to recover. If it's items of some notable value and they're not absolutely insane to have transported to a hub, it'll probably get bought up.
---
Yes, I played in vanilla.
---
The first task was to hit level 60.
---
hahaha sorry mate
---
Nothing of value was lost.
---
i've tried eve twice, but i just don't get it how do i supposed to learn pvp while i have no chance and after death  i have to gather isk for new ship and fit it for all next day?
---
It is a joke, it's very demoralizing to have CCP reimurbse something like that
---
😘
---
By passive cap regen, you mean pulsing the capital booster right? I'm playing around with fits but you can't really input how much time the cap bosster will be running
---
Except this type of thing is a rarity for them.
---
Our apologies that our 20k+ strong organization actually organized and developed a defensive doctrine, such that it is too risky for *you* and your 8 man nano/bomber gang to gank whatever it finds without dying. 
---
I mean, why should your 8 man gang have to work extra hard to get kills and actually risk their ship when they wander into space claimed and controlled by 20,000 players? 
---
Clearly, null needs a balance pass to make it so its actually easier for your small gang to kill sov holder assets in their own space than it for the sov holders to defend against your 8 man gang in their space. 
---
PS. 
---
There was literally a thread yesterday where some w-holer, after talking about how everything in null sec needed a nerf, responded to a question about how null sec players are actually supposed to make money, by suggesting sov holders have no imagination, and should, instead of mining and ratting in their space, do 'wormhole day trips.'
---
The standard nullbloc doctrines are all kitey ships nowadays, kiting feroxes, muninns, bombers, macs, nightmares, etc. Literally nobody brawls.
---
But if they went to WH's they'd lose.  And that wouldn't let them pretend they are elite.
---
Sure for your playstyle.
---
What is your goal?
---
42
---
I came from Star Wars Galaxies as my first MMO and its grind to WoW when it came out.  I made it almost to 60, but by then, I was so tired of grinding by that point I had to put it down.
---

---
Not sure why the sleeper loot is not actually showing.
---
But from April, ~55% of commodities is sleeper loot, while almost 95% of bounties is from NS.
---
So a general rule of thumb is to never fly a ship you can’t afford to buy more than one of. There a mission chains that are really good for beginners that will get you plenty enough isk to buy some T1 frigs to pvp in.
---
Do you think it'd be viable to swap a torp launcher for a probe launcher, for wormhole shenanigans?
---
yes, you can have it generate enough cap to tank everything no problem. Just bring some cap refit for the drifter on a bad day.
---
Simply put "too safe" is when you can walk away from your ratter, miner, or bot and not worry about dying since you're making so much doing nothing anyway.
---
&gt; Why? 
---
I agree, though I would say the risk conditions at the outset should be proportional to the reward you get from it, and the risk to organizations owning that space, while existing in the context of the original conditions of empty sov space, proportional to the effort and work the emergent player organization puts into mitigating that original risk state.
---
So item sheet DPS (like Ogre II, 64 damage or whatever it is) is base, then multipliers are applied multiplicatively? That's actually cool.
---
Then some guy logs in, sees a massive chain and just wants to rat in the static so he says "let's roll the static" and I die a little inside after having scanned that massive chain.
---
I have a bi-yearly run through of HW and HW2.  This year I actually amended it to be Deserts of Kharak up through HW2.  Never got into the multiplayer aspect, but I never needed to.  The Campaign was always enough for me.
---
i just leave you alone now really. theres no point in talking to you. maybe you should google first what standby memory means on windows 10. i automaticly uses parts of the ram to preload data of programs and files that are commonly used to make them start and react faster if you actually start them and if you need more ram, it frees up the. its not something i come up with in my mind that i have its a windows 10 thing. its how windows 10 does things.  its a completly normal behaviour. i dont have sli either so no clue. and no my cpu is 100% not "cooked" since its delid, my cooling solution overall probably cost as much as my pc and even under full load it doesnt even touch 55degrees outside sumer wich is mor elike 60 degrees.  but whatever. dont even answer anymore. i ll block you know because your annoy me as fck and the discussion youre forcing here has NO relation to issues eve clients currently have.
---
Yeah, thats what I'd do normally but this time I got pretty lucky and I've found  intact plates almost in every relic site. Trying to empty each time I did a relic site would've been really tidious/dangereous in Stain
---
wow thats really impressive killed 2 dictors (except it wasnt even PH on the top 3 of those kills) features CAPF btw
---
Congratulations on flying a bomber well.
---
There's a war? Because I keep seeing people use that word over the last year or so and it's not happened in game yet.
---
Last time i checked we were warping at 0 into enemy fleet that was bubbling themself.           
---
You simply cannot ignore your gun range.
---
Eve's design has always been that null has more risk and reward than hs (or ls).
---
Very little risk in dropping supers on a couple of hunters in your home constellation. Very little risk in Rorqual mining before chaos era. If you get tackled, all you need is to cyno, PANIC and you're pretty much guaranteed to survive. If you can be as safe as high-sec, but getting that much more rewards, they should either lower the rewards or up the risk. There's a reason hs dropped in population, everybody went to null as soon as it was safe, for more rewards.
---
\&gt; learn pvp 
---
Find a corp that does the type of PVP you think you'll like, join them, and get some practice while having support, makes things a lot easier.
---
I don't mean join a huge null sec corp necessarily, like literally anyone that has an active killboard will likely be of benefit to you. Bonus if they do a type of PVP where you think for yourself, but any experience with some safety net will help ya.
---
Wrong, august are the begining of winter here.  Because the night starts to come again so the cold come with it too.
---
Almost not joking :D 
---
Good month are June / july, and this year in iceland June / july were fucking good !!
---
Not at current moon mechanics also you assume all moons towered and in use - what is not happening.
---
I figured that was my best bet, thanks
---
It's moreso "Logi is more in demand"; there's always someone clamoring "need another logi" and much more rarely someone saying "need another \[jammer/disruptor/damper\]". You're right though, EWar ships and dedicated EWar pilots are the least populous (partly because it's harder to multibox, partly because their life expectancy in a fight is "lol no", partly because EWar gets no respect compared to DPS and logi because they're not doing things that visibly either make enemies die or make your guys live). 
---
(Well, not doing anything to make your guys live except for that one time that I was tackled at 20% hull by 2 Tengus, in an Orthrus with no Damage Control, my buddy in the Falcon hit two jams on them, and I warped out alive. Best day ever to have a friend who flies a Falcon.)
---
I've noticed NSers have been really good about locating our entrance WHs.  If your bearing in NS space it is a good idea to know every entrance to your system.
---
The answer is 42 as we all know. But I think the actual question was never unveiled in the book, am I wrong?
---
It's been a while though and I have no reverence. 
---
I'm 42 btw
---
im glad someone was around for that OLD eve forum post
---
one request
---
add a button to zero out movement in graphs? 
---
(also dark mode rip)
---
This sounds fun, but you will be surprised what you can do with Nestors in C6 Cataclysmic. You are running 5 accounts and how much of ISK value in ships - 5b? 5 Nestors total cost 3b will beat that ISK per hour rate for sure.
---
Get better at baiting. There are still plenty of ways to drop caps you just don’t want to think of new ways to do it.
---
I was thinking about calling it a day but blackout is to blame, it gave me a false sense of safety /s
---
Indeed. 
---
I don't krab though. Like literally ever. 
---
I market PVP and make far more iskies that way than my poor fellow goons who grind those combat anoms.
---
Killing an ihub is a win. Resets the ADM/strat index, which turns off any ihub upgrades (such as ansibles/jammers which take 2 months to regain the required Strat index for), and allows structures to online in 2 days instead of 6.
---
"My dad got cancer and then evil blob took all my stuff" is PR that CCP doesn't need, in order to provide an incentive that you already have but are not using.
---
(Take a look at all those high-sec ECs and Refineries that are terrible spam....and would drop billions of materials if you'd attack them.  But you don't, despite this incentive.)
---
&gt;If a kill mail was generated where lost items were attributed to the character who owned the items, instead of the owner of the citadel, then a GM could quite easily check last log in date and see the extended leave of absence from the game. If a player files a ticket that explains the situation and links the killmail, The GMs now also have a list of all your stuff and can pop it back into existence in the closest low sec system.
---
So we only need to change killmails, load up the GM team with even more work, and then endure the bitching about not being considered "extended" by a handful of days.
---
For an incentive you already have but are not using.
---
&gt;Let's not say things are impossible because they might possibly negatively effect us in the future.
---
Let's not pretend lack of drops are the issue.  There were zero drops from conquerable stations and outposts.  And 99.9999999% of POSes had nothing of value stored in them.  Yet all of those got shot.
---
Yea I used chain them in null with mission pullers. I haven't done it since the Nergal came out though. If you're multiboxing its better to just have that account do a separate mission instead of all heading to the same mission.
---
Inertial stabilisers do not affect sig radius. I think you're thinking of a different module?
---
Yeah man... If I have the luxury of being able to spend all day mining, my 4x Hulks and 2x Orcas bring in just under a billion ISK/day in compressed ore - and that's mining Spodumain, Gneiss, and ABC.
---
AFK Orca's are not pulling that much in, especially if they're AFK too long and pop the rocks their drones are on.
---
The latter
---
You mean like the time a tiny minority paid others to evict the biggest coalition in the game? Thats strange, could have sworn that happened before all of this started. Could it be that stagnation was always a part of the game and everyone have just forgotten about it?
---
&gt;Sure for your playstyle.
---
No, that has nothing to do with my playstyle. Not even eve specific. 
---
An open world MMO where the game presents all the player names near you is not a fun mechanic. I rather want something similar to d-scan .. but not d-scan. Something where the play has to work to get intelligence. Not get a simple list, without any user input.
---
Another example are offgrid boosters. I benefited greatly from them, yet they where shitty from a game mechanic point of view. I was glad when they got removed.
---
For me it's not about making live in 0.0 harder or easier. But replacing that shitty mechanic.
---
I left eve over a year ago, started playing wow again about 6 weeks ago, and am really looking forward to the classic relaunch.   I guess i am way ahead
---
You already seem to have a point of view on the subject, so why ask? Reading the numerous posts for and against recent or coming changes wasn't enough?
---
I doubt this is even worth it, but let's get some negative karma just for the sake of it. In any ecosystem you have different forms of life coexisting, from predators to parasites and everything in between, who all depend on a delicate balance to thrive; when that balance is fucked with for any reason, favouring one of those forms of life in excess or the opposite, the whole ecosystem risks destruction.
---
With all the limits that comparison has with human interaction in a videogame (and there are plenty), I think it still works to explain the essence of this debate. The concept that this is a "PVE vs PVP" conflict is completely wrong, and is only being pushed by major blocks to try to divert attention from the real debate: Risk vs Reward. And no, it's far from the same.
---
Me and others that are in favour of this changes (with our own critics about them, most significant one being that they are just band-aids that don't adress the core issues) consider that said balance has been broken in all regions of the game: 
---
1. HS seemed balanced, but the "risk" factor was being carried by old and broken mechanics that actually got people to quit the game, so those needed to be modified: enter War changes, nerf to bumping undefinitely and roaming nasty Triglavians that kill people generating resources afk.
---
2. LS is inbalanced in favour of the risk, the inability to effectively control systems or regions and the abundance of blood thirsty groups big and small mainly focused on PVP, added to the fact that the rewards are scarce and demand certain dominance of an area (L5 missions), deep knowledge of the game (burner pirate missions as an example) and/or are utterly broken and inherently dangerous (FW), greatly refrain people from living there. There's just no real incentive to people to settle there, least of all newbros. And least of all if you have the opposite right next door. Enter... well, nothing really, still waiting for CCP to do *something* about Lowsec.
---
3. NS is/was the opposite. The ability to actually control space and defend it (bubbles and no natural places for the enemy to dock up and stage from, at least without creating one), while providing greater rewards than the previous two (more and better ores, more and better anomalies, more and better DED sites, more and better exploration sites, and lets not forget for even a second the big one, the ability to build Supercapitals), made it the perfect place to live in and movilized human's most basic instincts that lead them to look for safety in numbers. Intel channels, intel tools like NEAR2, massive structures to keep your ships and resources in perfect safety (assets safety), while exerting home advantage dropping everything on anything even remotely dangerous that wasn't a real invasion of the region (which noone really has a real reason to do and is a completely different problem that CCP needs to solve asap) by mostly just pushing a button, made the massive rewards avaiable without any real or serious risk as long as you are part of a massive group (which nowadays is 99% of nullsecs population if you include renters). Enter blackout, cyno changes and whatever it is CCP is planning next if anything. Will this solve the issue? Did CCP went too far in the opposite direction? Noone can tell yet, but I'm happy they are at least trying... if they went too far well, we can always tone it down, after all this has happened for several years, so a little recesion doesn't sound really that bad.
---
(NPC-Null falls somewhere in between LS and NS, not gonna get into specific but it probably has the worst of both worlds).
---
4. WH seem somewhat balanced, maybe slightly favouring rewards over resources, but noone can deny that even if you can make lots of isk the risk there is very very real. I'm sure that's why CCP is taking some ideas form there, like removing local (and no, people claiming that they are making NS into WH space is just really ignorant about WH mechanics; hint: it's far more than not having local chat).
---
And I made a fucking wall of text... sorry about that.
---
Not gonna go much further, just going to point that this isn't an attack to PVE or to "human interaction", that's just koolaid. The consequences of the imbalance are there to be seen for anyone that gives a fuck: inflation, massive isk and resources entering the game with most of it failing to leave it, stagnation and all the shit everyone has been complaining about for years. 
---
CCP has finally decided to do something about it, I'm for once willing to wait how it plays out and what more there is to come, hoping the once somewhat healthy balance of the sandbox is restaured (to some degree at least).
---

---
Have you ever thought of becoming a journalist reporting on things nobody else cares about but you? I bet there is a market there...  
---
You seem to have a investigative tools and the drive, now you just need the audience. kek
---
We don't even receive abyssal pvp (not that I really want it) and that doesn't require CCP to staff it.
---
CAP F BEST F!
---
How many times is it normally spammed to make it true?
---
Why cap booster on rattle? You have passive tank no?
---
Because everyone else’s point of view doesn’t make sense, it’s why i’m asking
---
Further proves how broken Rorqs are.  A mining ship can withstand a fleet better than the most powerful PvP ship in the game.
---
It's not about the size of the umbrella.  It's how you use it!
---
Train up to tech II haulers quickly. It'll be expensive but in a tech 1 hauler if you're carrying more than like 70 mill in value then you're a target for suicide ganking. In a DST you won't be a target until like 300-500 mill because the ships can be super tanky. If you're ballsy you can move even more stuff in them pretty safely. Just don't expect to do much with the T1 haulers and for the love of God don't fit a T1 hauler for max storage and then carry all of your assets in it. you will get ganked .
---
I don't really shine on pvp because of that I usually do pve/exploration. When I get sparable Isk, I hop on a pvp fitted ship and die in 5 minutes without killing anything but each time I get really close to killing something and that makes it going. And I always say go big or go home and proceed to spend half of my money, I guess I'm not the one to take suggestions from. But I always get some adrenaline rush everytime I hear the target locking sound.  I say ISK well spent.
---
It feels like, a little lame to do that. If he seemed interested I planned on PMing him with it.
---
Sounds really fun, but it would kill HiCs.
---
how about, smoke some more crack. that empires separated by low sec, no. that would damage the game. don't be a fool
---
What are you even talking about? Do you even NS? And how you are even trying to gloss over the fact that 2-3% of eves population including alts are making half of what NS does with about 40% of the pop with alts is truly mindboggling.
---
That means that if WHs had 6% of the games population they would be making as much as 40% of the games population that engage in "no risk free isk". If that isnt broken then I have no idea what broken is.
---
Vnis are 60m fitted and you can do that 45-60m/hr essentially AFK (pre-chaos era). You could easily do 4-6 VNIs at once.
---
* Regular mission running nets about the same as VNI ratting 45-60m/hr. They're really not as easy to multi-box as VNI ratting is.
---
* L4 Missions can be blitzed in a 1 bil Machariel for roughly 90m/hr and are very input intensive.
---
* You can blitz burners missions and make 100-200m isk/hr, with a 300-500 mil ship, but are very hard and very input intensive.
---
* Incursions can be done for 100-200m isk/hr, but again, you're in a 1bil ship that's pretty input intensive. You could maybe multibox 2-3, but it's very hard and not all incursion groups will accept multiboxers.
---
Rorquals can mine for the same amount as doing incursions and are basically 100% safe if you have a cyno, PANIC and half a brain. They are also very multi-boxable.
---
There's a reason every casual pveer moved to null and why hisec is really not as populous as it used to be. It's about as safe with bigger rewards, so why would you ever stay in hisec?
---
Bait portals are ancient.
---
Good old "Click portal to summon"
---
Well, there you got my answer... but asking something already having decided that the arguments against your point of view "don't make sense" is just a big sing of stupidity. Just saying.
---
Why are you missing 2 mids? Target painters would help you apply your damage better to frigs.
---
Mention retail and see which REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEs like a motherfucker.
---
That's not why neutral logi was nerfed.  You spun it pretty hard contributing it to being favorable to freighter pilots.
---
You might be surprised, but nullsec is also full of people wanting to fight.
---
Here's a common occurrence:
---
- you form a roaming gang
---
- you roam to your nearest hostile (frenemy?) entity
---
- you look to fight anyone in your path
---
- anyone in 5 jumps radius of you current position is docking up
---
- you look to poke the enemy in any way to force a reaction
---
- ccp removed all ways of disrupting your enemy without a 5 day timer
---
- you realize you wasted your time and go back home
---
- optionally, a friendly enemy FC pms you, ask you to stick around till he forms something of equal value (yey meaningless arranged fights)
---
There are three modules that use cap in a fit that’s used against neut heavy rats. One of the modules fills a GTOF NOW role.
---
Damps are definitely my second favorite form of ewar.
---
Aight ty
---
&gt;I'd try looking through some dude's holes
---
Legit lol.
---
Honestly, because I'm still figuring this stuff out, and balancing my cap/fit stuff is still something I'm not great at
---
ExzookiZ used to meme about gas huffing in tengus, now we know why.
---
Because you don't run multiple accounts in parallel.
---
High sec PvP is unpopular and will most likely make you unpopular. Whether its ganking, war deccing or suspect baiting, they all can be very profitable but some people will get angry at you. (which is funny most of the time)
---
If you mean the eviction of Goonswarm/CFC from the north, that's not stagnation. That was conflict, actual war. We haven't had an actual major war since then, at least not one with major changes in nullsec empire borders or any shift in the balance of power. I was in the CFC back then, they were a major force but by no means could they take on the rest of eve like Goons can now.
---
Oh? I failed to see how neutral logi is more game breaking vs ganking. I also find it ridiculously hard to go after neutral logi while allowing ganking to be a thing in HS. There are counters to neut logi yet what counters is there to ganking? I know one, neut logi but its a spun debate in your eyes. Pfft, get real.
---
Put it all in a charon and fly it through Niarja.
---
You're breathtaking!
---
3 dictors and jokes on you, we were part of the horde fleet.
---
You managed to ... replace the strat index that had been the goal the whole time?
---
I agree, this is probably a workaround until they can get the proper certs signed.
---
You know what I want a lot more than easy kills? Actual fights. Null had plenty of actual fights before it became a ratting paradise. Once null started becoming focused on ratting, the best way to protect your space is to deny all content. By denying all content, you're guaranteeing that every corp that used to roam in your space will stop and living in your space becomes much safer. There used to be a lot of corps living in NPC null, roaming alliance space for good fights. Those are all basically gone now, because of content denying supers.
---
Whaling is a creation that came about because those are the only kills that you can get in big bloc null.
---
If I'm complaining about a super dropped on me, it's not because I want to kill that worthless ratter or miner and it denied me the kill, it's because if it had been a fleet of 40-50 subcaps (as it used to be in the past), I can actually fight that with my 5-man gang. I can get actual content. Idgaf about that VNI, or that Rorq, they are defenseless and worthless. I want to fight outnumbered, actually need to use my brain to fight.
---
Way better options to use on a steak, 3/10 line
---
Dude, you are wrong. Ore isnt faucets as it doesnt create isk, it just transfers when its sold. 
---
And ship deaths are a mixture of faucet and isk sink since insurance adds money. Faucets are things that create pure isk out of nothing, bounties are faucets, blue loot is faucets, insurance is faucets (partly isk sink). Ore is not since it holds no inherent value and is only valued at what you can sell it for, its a commodity that only transfers isk, doesnt create it.
---
Or just remove NPC markets. Not sure why they still exist, other than for skill books which could be moved to LP stores.
---
Ehm... You just called great success that CCP made people to stop the game?
---
You know the point is that not the player's job to deal with bots. We are the ones, who play for the game. It's the company's job to be able to deal with it. Blackout not a solution. It works only, if the players go to bothunt. And honestly, I not want to play for a company to let me hunt bots...

There is a mirrored test server you can practice PvP on if you want.

Buy a bunch of LSI first too...

Have you ever considered moving into a wormhole?

I feel your pain, my 1 is scan a chain out took an age so go for a bio and some one has decided to roll. Then the next guy get on asking for a hs....
---
While PixelSoda's post is a bit over the top, miniluv dudes in gs_isk (Imperium jabber channel) have been talking about doing exactly this and then biomassing as some kind of protest. They also mention that you can potentially have a biomass reversed, so they're not all that committed to quitting.
---
It'd have been more interesting but as we have seen with botting supers it doesn't fundamentally solve the issue of the explosion of minerals because it can still be multiboxed.
---
The only way to solve both of those issues is forced scarcity - no longer can you have infinitely spawning ratting sites, or infinitely respawning asteroid clusters (I know they've done some work for this but it's not enough).
---
Force people to move and/or leave their safety and fewer will do so
---
It's not in the item description but if you dig in the attributes you'll see an 11% signature radius modifier on Inertial Stabilizers II
---
How many ISK/hr is worthwhile? 
---
More importantly, what's the reasoning behind that number?
---
Sounds good to me
---
Wow, you're still playing? I had no idea. I thought you were in prison.
---
Multiboxing is not an issue, it's just very hard to do in hisec using any of the isk-generating methods (besides maybe mining, but you need 4-5 accounts to equal 1 Rorqual). Pre-chaos era, I can get 5 VNIs running at once for pretty good ISK/hr. Only need 300mil to start and the accounts (which I'm skill-farming to sub for free). Try to reach that in hisec, it's basically impossible.
---
More than another activity. So I can spend as little time and/or energy doing it.
---
It happens to people worse then the best more often though.
---
&gt;optionally, a friendly enemy FC pms you, ask you to stick around till he forms something of equal value (yey meaningless arranged fights)
---
A lot of FCs do this without telling their fleet mates.  FC's just pre-arrange to get battles and while it's meaningless to some it is helpful training.
---
Tldr: whining that he cant 1v1 all of delve because supers
---
What are you fucking talking about.
---
Cap booster would help if you're worried about capacitor. And make sure you train all the core skills. I know sometimes you really want to train that shiny new weapon skill or ship skill, but core skills are super important because they actually allow you to fit the modules you want and not run out of cap using them.
---
Check out some of these links below. They have some good skill plans. Obviously you can remove some of the skills that don't support your play style, like if you're just want to concentrate on your bomber you don't really need the skill that reduces capacitor for hybrid and laser guns. But they're still good to train at some point since I'm sure you'll want to fly other ships at some point.

The monument is at the harbourfront, close to the Harpa convention center, not at CCP HQ
---
The amount of griefing on undocks and gates would be unreal. Also I don't feel this would affect war deccers at all.
---
afaik booshing is already a criminal activity.
---
Sure, a whole section of gameplay disappears and I'm just whining. Great response.
---
wow what an epic burn XDDDDD
---
I agree completely. The game was balanced better before they existed as well as CCP was able to control the mineral flows. Great point w/ the botting supers.
---
When people praise bob, what does that mean? Who, or what, is bob?
---
That’s easy, all you have to do is stay in a starter system and warp to the rogue cloning facility each day. Feeble rats, but they still give you the rewards.
---
I mean, I guess it's better than taking your sorry roam back home.
---
Fun fact, that structure bomb killed the bubble tackling me right before my siege was done.
---
It's not that it's bad practice, it's just that there's no more (or very little) organic content. Especially compared to what null used to be like a few years ago.
---
&gt; More than another activity. So I can spend as little time and/or energy doing it. 
---
A true politician. Doesn't answer questions.
---
Now I'm curious. Come forward please.
---
Are you, by chance, working on a C# fitting library?
---
Seems like the web equivalent of forgetting to pay the sov bill.
---
Nope. It's either JS to have benefit of web or C++.
---
I think you get it man, but just to completely clarify my point; since eve is a game the people playing it should strive to do what they enjoy. So as long as you're having fun at it you're doing it right. 
---
For sure the playstyle I described isn't for everyone. I'm only being hyperbolic to emphasize my opinion when I call the miners or pve'ers sad losers. The people who are losing are the players who mine for days, disliking it the whole time, just to buy and fit some pvp ships which they promptly lose. Or the guys who get stuck in a progress trap of mission treadmills until they find themselves in some expensive faction battleship with a big pile of money and nothing to spend it on because they are too uninformed or afraid of anywhere outside of highsec. 
---
People who like to mine should mine. People who enjoy the mission should run them. People should reject grinding for the sake of a number in a bank account when it comes to a game. And way more people, especially new guys, should be told that they don't have to do things they dislike in the game in order to do fun things later, because too often, later never comes.
---
Why would you contact someone Facebook for technical support in the first place...
---
Sure, when I used to roam null with my 5-10 man gang back in the day, and then the owners of that space showed up to fight in 40-50 subcaps (which was awesome, I can fight that), I just wanted to kill those 40-50 subcaps without risking my ships. Sure.
---
Oops, there's a super. I guess my only choice is to leave now, I can't fight that. That's a great mechanic /s.

You can scroll down with mouse while holding cursor over target vector, if I understood correctly your request.

---
While I agree with what your sentiment I learned a long time ago that not everyone is teachable. Some are simply immune to logic and this sub is filled with way too many of those. Many who have been against this shitty age of chaos have already presented what we believe these changes will do, now with the passing of time even data backs us up yet the goalposts keep getting moved.
---
Remember, "uh its only bots leaving", "uh CCP is saying MAU/DAU are up", "uh bots are dead", "uh bots cant scan", "uh we only want good fights, thats why we bomb excavs", "uh we only want good fights that why we bring cloaky ships" and so on. Every time their BS has been disproven they counter with "uh no you are wrong, we never said any of it".
---
Its rather clear that this is all narrative and even if the game dies because of these changes they will still blame everyone else. Thats how weak people work, always someone elses fault. They couldnt find content so its our fault, they couldnt keep up with the economic changes so its our fault, they are bad at hunting its our fault and so on.
---
They only want more crutches whilst believing they are "hardcore". Which is a joke, no real hardcore player would ever bitch like they do. They would adapt as the real content creators have and guess what, theyre not the ones who were crying for years until CCP decided to give out handicaps simply because a small group couldnt keep up. 
---
But nothing will change the fact that the game is objectively worse today than before all of this began. Every change has been a reduction instead of addition which is literally the worst way to develop a game. But its cheaper and as long as idiots keep hailing these changes CCP will continue this route instead of actually fking adding new content so that everyone gets what they want.
---
And CCP, stop fking trying to balance small gang with big gang. That Eve died years ago, nothing you can do today will bring it back without killing most of the games population. Instead focus on a future where small gang fights small gang and big gangs fight big gangs.
---
Neut logi was abused massively in every form of HS PVP.  Freighters using it to avoid ganks was a drop in the bucket.
---
Rise called them "cute little gangs". I like that term.

”o o f ing permission requested”
---
Alts probably freeports can be bait.
---
GotB members should go back to what they're good at. Cucking and botting and spare us the cringe.
---
Really? Thats why Rise said they will have to adjust things upwards because the faucet situation actually isnt in a good long term spot atm.
---
I am pretty sure the changes will only reduce the amount of *poor* capital pilots, the amount of *dumb* capital pilots will not change that much
---
When, exactly, was null not a ratting paradise where you could easily find "actual fights" (by that i assume you mean GFs and/or ratters that didnt fight back)?
---
The closest thing i can think of is back when PH was an actual newbro corp and you could just sit in O1Y fighting the T1 frigs they/we threw at everything.
---
Flair Checks out
---
I mean a support ticketing system would be a good way to contact them, but shit the issue prevented me from getting in. 
---
Raise the issue another way maybe, like FB. I understand the concepts are likely difficult for you
---
Oof
---
They chose to be in a 24/7/365 business.  I don't think it's unreasonable to have very occasional events cover one of your largest chunks of the playerbase's TZs.
---
Completely agree, I lived myself that mission running loophole my first time in the game back in '09, which made me take several breaks during a couple of years before quitting for good for like three years.
---
Luckily I decided to come back with a new mentality in 2015 and here I am still, enjoying the game and trying to spread the "have fun" way of life around.
---
Any big enough fight will create TIDI. If you think theory survives contact with TIDI or thousands of players in one system under god knows how many flags then you are naive at best.
---
And interesting isnt the same as tedious. It never was.
---
What you are trying to solve for is that everyone has now moved on to Supers and Rorqs. You can't put the genie back in the bottle and put everyone back in cruisers. The issue you are having isnt that null has become more safe due to gameplay changes (it has some with citadels, but that is a problem everywhere), it is that injectors and time have led to an environment where huge high EHP ships can be thrown around by just about anyone.

Hey guys, I'm curious as to the pricing on the items. I switched to the new evepraisal source (thanks!) but it is still very inaccurate with certain items. An example, a fit I'm currently working on uses  a Pith X-Type X-Large Shield Booster, which Pyfa lists as 132 M, but evepraisal lists it as 416 Sell / 380 Buy on the website? 
---
How do I get more accurate pricing info, anything I'm missing? 
---
Thanks for the awesome tool btw! u/FluorescentFlux
---
If you want to turn nullsec the high risk/high reward environment it's supposed to be then you first increase the risk and cut the out of control faucets, then think about how you can increase the reward (isk/hr - yield). The same approach is in my campaign document.
---
Maybe they just need to redo the plans and remove that pesky exhaust port.
---
No u
---
Command destroyers can fit a micro jump field thing that makes everything in range (~6km) that isn't scrammed jump 100km in the direction the destroyer is pointed. 
---
Booshing is the act of offensively using this by scramming undesirable ships to drag the desirable (logi, excavators etc) ones out of range to be dealt with easier
---
I cringe every time someone mentions pre-arranged fights in a sandbox game. 
---
Yes, you *can* do that, but it just feels like it's a lobby or match-making service like Call of Duty.
---
C++ can be wrapped for C# so that would be just as good.
---
Roughly before citadels, around 2011-2014.
---
They had some algorithm for procedural generation of the universe, and they used 42 as the seed for what we live in now
---
Since the last moon change turned out to be so great we just fuck it up further and its bound to work this time?
---
Do you have any knowledge of industry? Cause if you do anything even remotely close to this then welcome massive inflation on a scale you never knew was possible. It would most likely kill the game within months.
---
Oh... Woooosh I guess then :)
---
It depends on what statics do you have, and which one can be used to rat.
---
But yeah, right in the feels, fierce krabs ruin my beautiful pathfinder chains ;-;
---
the tax should also apply to citadels right? not just NPC stations
---
And ganking isnt being abused daily? Yet one has a counter while the other doesn’t. But lets focus on the one with a counter lol. Logic here is unreal.
---
Neut logi doesn’t bother the person who isn’t in a corp. on top on that, neut logi went suspect. You could invite all of eve to come kill it. Neut logi was never a broken mechanic so to cry about it baffles me.
---
Now ganking and lack of new player retention because of ganking is definitely something that needed to be looked at prior to neut logi. I can’t imagine that new guy who spent weeks mining in HS just to save enough isk to buy a mining barge. Some nullsec people who dont have anything to do who sits on fat stacks of cash trains his alt to fly max dps catalyst. See noob guy mining (permit or not) and goes to gank him. Best thing about this broken mechanic is the same guy can gank him over and over again as long as he is “role playing”. Even if he gets told to stop, doesn’t stop someone else to go gank said player. No matter what you do, you will never be able to counter them. Except that one group that isn’t around anymore who saved freights with neut logi. It was so effective neut logi was removed a month later. Wow.....yeah that happened. I was there. Anyway please keep telling me how neut logi was broken.
---
When it comes down to it and however you want to say it, The players who think neut logi was broken didn’t have the knowledge, know where to look, did ask questions because of pride, or was just lazy in planning and execution. In no way does it make neut logi OP. Now thats on the table, whats your answer to ganking?
---
&gt;Nobody’s gonna fly capitals
---
That's where you're wrong, kiddo. [fingerguns]
---
Wow. Why not go play My Little Pony since Eve is too challenging for you.
---
&gt; Why the hell are you bringing the 'krabbing' part here.
---
&gt; It is not about krabing but about capital brawls.
---
No. The change doesn't significantly impair capital fights. The people who are disturbed by it are typically the people who are invested in the risk free krabbing the pre-blackout null offered, trying to use the capital fights angle as a counter-argument. It doesn't work. People will easily adapt and still escalate capitals.
---
&gt; Like krabing will be safer than ever
---
No it wont.
---
&gt; Umbrella will still work
---
Living under an umbrella will involve a significant minimum level of risk. None of this is about completely destroying umbrellas.
---
&gt; So you have a shield recon and a fax undocked and waiting.
---
1) No. Not every super will be constantly accompanied by a recon. Most of the time they will be bridged from the home system to a cyno beacon etc, and the roamers will have a chance to prevent them from warping to the grid.
---
2) Even if all null capitals will now have accompanying recons, at least the roamers will be able to kill the recons. That alone will suffice an entire night's content for the hunting side and a good compromise.
---
That's true (especially the injectors, god the injectors).
---
That's why I think the changes should focus around nerfing the projection of the umbrella. The cyno changes are a part of it, but what if (for examples) you nerfed fighter application so that they don't really project well on subcaps and remove/nerf ewar fighters? You couldn't just drop a super that forces a small gang to leave the grid. I can fight around 40-50 subcaps. Heck, I can even fight around carriers if I pilot properly (although it is much harder). Supers are basically impossible to fight on the same grid as a small gang.
---
Which doesnt mean much if people arent actually using the faucets. Its all assumptions. Besides, Rise said that the blackout isnt even needed to control the faucets since that could be handled in other ways. The faucet situation wasnt bad enough to warrant this change and upping the reward wont yield what you think it will.
---
Very unfortunate. Asteros are very tanky and I think you would've had a fair chance even in a 2 vs 1 fight. Too bad about the Stratios lol. Better luck next time.
---
Never flown either in a L5, but I'd hazard a guess it's the smaller sig, and extra launcher. I imagine L5s are a fantastic way to get your Geckos killed by rats too.
---
\[EDIT\] *And* missile damage bonus that isn't K+T locked.
---
I love CapF and love that they're part of PanFam. &lt;3 you guys, 1 0 0 %

Or I just prefer using proper channels for communication like E-Mail instead of a social media website so the report doesn't end up in the marketing department.
---
Don't let it bother you.  Go out and do it again.
---
I have lost a bill in exploration.  I don't return until the hold is full.  it isn't the lost stuffs that hurts, it is buying another Zeugma and Blackglass implant.
---
Prends mon haut vote !
---
Lol nevermind. It turns out that you have to press the "Optimize Fit Price" (Ctrl+D) for it to find the right pricing. No amount of settings shuffling, restarting pyfa, or making new fits changed the price until I did that.
---
No I mean that a tiny minority paid for the war, i.e., they controlled the game. According to you thats stagnation and a game that wasnt a sandbox anymore. Yet you are arguing here that it was a sandbox game and not stagnation.
---
So Im not sure what you are presenting as the main reason behind this? Is it bad for a tiny minority to have control over the game or not? And if yes then why wasnt it an issue back then.
---
And thats an assumption. Goons can become as big as they want but the rest of the game will still stomp them. You just need a different approach.
---
&gt;reduce the amount of *poor* capital pilots
---
In the early game they tell you not to rush past Frigates into Cruisers and Battleships because "a bigger ship isn't always better"; and because if you try launching and losing a Battleship, a week into the game, without the skill to fly it or the money to replace it, you're gonna have a bad time. (All of which is true, in the subcapital arena.)
---
Ironic how we've been having *capital ship* pilots complaining about the cost of cruisers
---
If you can afford a carrier but can't afford a cruiser, could you really afford that carrier?
---
"CCP SRP" is a joke in my group and ive heard a few others say it. I think it stems from some rediculous reimbursements. 
---
Like a common one is "the sun was in my eyes" - reimbursed 
---
"My ship was spinning in circles " - reimbursed, however I think that's an actual bug with manual flight gettig turned on
---
I wish it wasn't a joke unless it's an obvious bug or server fault no reimbursement ))) abusing a system is bad, but if I think people feel if they don't then they're missing out.
---
It's a playerbase made deity, originated in wormholes and that allegedly likes corpses being given as a sacrifice to it.
---
Not really sure how or when this religion came to be, but here it is.
---
im a new player and i learned to pvp by asking question to my corporation, not reddit ;)
---
&gt; Anyhow, letsencrypt / certbot is probably not good for companycerts.
---
PKI manager here - you're correct.
---
I had someone threaten to rape my mother after I ganked their burner frigate, lol. 
---
If you enjoy your salt, definitely fight in high sec.
---
I had a mobile depot, and I use it. I died when I was planning leave the system.  I do quick  runs on Stain since the blackout , I scan the system, do the relic site if theres any and ignore others and move to the other system asap. After I scanned the systems I planned to scan, I leave the stain via wormhole I already scanned. No docking/dropping the loot because I don't plan staying at Stain, I want to sell my loot or store at my home system. Thats why I think its tidious for me, getting back the loot from a station or scooping the mobile depot I dropped godknows how many jumps ago slows me down a lot and doesn't fit with my playstyle which is proven to be working for me after so many hours and Isks I made without losing much
---
Oh god Shkreli would make such a top tier capsuleer wtf
---
i learn with Dis he say jump, low sec corp, they are really bunch of nice dudes,  and good at pvp, sometimes lol
---
a 'will not appear in local' module would be good as long as it's easy to fit
---
Those can be scanned down can't they. A secure container in a safe would be better? (I think??)
---
I’ve been killed by then many times, sometimes ;)
---
Same as the hunter gets the loot, doesn't make it less tedious.
---
Fuck, is that what y’all do? I’ve been... I don’t even want to tell y’all what I’ve been doing this whole time.
---
This is not a serious suggestion lol. Fuck it. Make it use .1 powerfrid and .1 cpu
---
This is the kind of stuff that always hurts the soul but at the same time - maybe we all hope for that danger a little bit. If there wasn't any source of conflict or lost, it would just be a terrible single player game.
---
yet here you are posting
---
Ye  all the way the  to the end it is correct. I went FF14 OVER WOW lol
---
&gt; Which doesnt mean much if people arent actually using the faucets. Its all assumptions.
---
Idk what this is supposed to mean. 
---
&gt; Besides, Rise said that the blackout isnt even needed to control the faucets since that could be handled in other ways
---
No he didn't. You're confusing cyno changes with blackout.
---
&gt; The faucet situation wasnt bad enough 
---
It was really bad for past 3-4 years. It looked like it was trending back at the exact moment before blackout but that was because Goons and North were at war (nobody was farming in neither Delve nor the North).
---
&gt; upping the reward wont yield what you think it will.
---
It will make nullsec a high risk/high reward place. Those who are too scared can move their moneymaking activities elsewhere. It's good for the game's macroeconomy that they don't farm null anomalies. Those who are willing to take the risk will still make good money. At the end, it will yield a balanced game with meaningful risk/reward. I have no other claim like "it will yield more kills" as I am fully aware less people will farm. But it will convert more of the farm to the kills, which is the meaningful statistic in my eye.
---
The guy was talking about blopsing. About how blopsers want fights, my argument is that since they are rather shitty it doesnt make sense for them to actually take fights. They are not built for it.
---
But stukas and doctrines like it can ofc take fights. However they are not blops doctrines, rather something in between. And they excel at taking fights against defense capitals so they want escalations.
---
Strongly agree with this.  Solo moving caps should not require you to risk feeding multiple recons, that's way too high a barrier.  A spoolup cyno is a fair compromise that prevents the instant hotdrop but still allows the utility to move your ships.
---
I think we thinking of two different DHSJ
---
Thats exactly how I feel about the opposing side, which is why I asked for logic.  The only logic I've seen is "Quit if you dont like it", "null is too safe" with no explanation whatsoever or rationale, or just general bitching for wanting their "playstyle" to be easier.  
---
Hate me, call me studpid, I honestly don't care. The lack of logical rational and edgy "Give me ur stuff and biomass" attitude is a poison that's going to destroy this community, or what will be left of it soon
---
I'm not as passionate about these changes as you apparently are.  I also don't mine and hardly haul.  The only advice I have is what you've probably heard a thousand times but don't agree with.  Don't mine AFK.  Fit tank to your miner.  Set low standings for CODE so you can identify them in local.  Don't haul over certain amounts depending on what ship type you have. I'm sorry you've been so negatively affected by these things.  I really hope you find a way to overcome these obstacles.
---
Change sec status of all current trade hubs, make Jita, perimeter .5
---
The guess I would hazard is that because the Barghest is fast as *fuck* by battleship standards, it can kite out, outrun, and avoid much of the incoming damage, while the Rattlesnake is forced to just sit there and take it. So even though the Rattlesnake can apply greater DPS, it's harder to keep itself alive to deal it.
---
What is "risk"?  
---
Dropping capitals is putting them out to die if out escalated or baited.  
---
Is "risk" just lacking the ability to fight back to you...?
---
Is "safety" just the ability to actually live in fights?  
---
You got to understand, your point of view is based on nonsensical buzzwords with no gameplay balance or logical backing
---
Prearreange fights? lool  relly? haha.
---
Why dont you prearrange your fights then?
---
If people arent farming then it doesnt matter if the isk is upped. Learn to read perhaps?
---
Minute 16 on the TIS. Here you go  [https://www.talkinginstations.com/2019/08/ccp-rise-speaks-on-chaos-and-cynos/](https://www.talkinginstations.com/2019/08/ccp-rise-speaks-on-chaos-and-cynos/). 
---
Could have been handled in other ways just like Rise is saying. 
---
Which again, means nothing if people arent actually farming. You are only assuming that they will.
---
I think you could have just nerfed Cap damage application on subcaps (smaller than BC/BS level)  and left cynos the way they were. That way you could still cyno in your super, but you wouldnt apply to that jackdaw gang with it anyway.
---
If I was the only person in the office because everyone else got leave and I didn't, you can guarantee that I'd get even less done than usual.
---
It's literally in the name.
---
Your imagination its awsome, i like how you talk thinging you talk for everyone.
---
You can't prearrange non-consensual pvp.
---
My point is, there is so much crocodile tears over how people wanted precious capital fights and escalations, while these people are in fact only upset about umbrella/riskless krabbing implications of cyno changes. While if you really wanted capital gudfites, nothing is holding you from having them one way or another.
---
Then he should say that. I dont know enough about mudflation to talk about it so I wont respond as to what he meant. But my response is to his words and not his intention.
---
Edit: By reading a bit on what mudflation is it seems that the main component is isk losing value. Which is happening more now than before. So it would be wrong even from that perspective. How big the moneybase is isnt that strongly linked to purchasing power, atleast not in Eve. If prices go down then your value goes up, not down. You are losing purchasing power as we speak, not gaining it. The entire idea is based on irl economic theory but its far more complex than simple this will do that.
---
yes yes we’re all elite and everyone not ourselves are shit ya? move along plz
---
It's clear that alot of people who like to mine and rat risk free hate the blackout. FIFY
---
i did answer your question.
---
it's relative - it just has to be better isk than other alternatives for the time/energy invested.
---
i just want max return for minimal investment - it's pve content.
---
From a T2 cruiser? Yeah that's not bad.
---
&gt; This war seems like a bit of a clusterfuck with neither side really winning or losing.
---
And that's why this is my all time favorite war.
---
I gave you what I think is a pretty logical answer, which of course you can and surely will disagree with, and all I got in return is you sperging like a moron about the lack of answers. I didn't say a single of those things in my post, and yet you keep and keep bitching about something I didn't do.
---
You don't want logic, you just want to scream that you are right and pissed about people not praising you for that and repeating the ever present "EVE is gonna die!!!". So sorry, but I won't indulge a selfentitled manchild anymore.
---
Have fun.
---
Yeah, I think I could've won if it was 1v2 or at least make one of them disengage. My fit is capable of it with double reps and cap booster plus I have high drone skills
---
It's amusing how zkillboard lists these as ganks.
---
I represent people who want to kill stuff in nullsec. I got voted in defending their interests, with very successful election results, and have kept touch with my base since then. If anyone can talk about what hunters want, it's me. Sorry.
---
multiboxing is not an issue - yet it's the only way you can explain how to get more isk/hour than somebody in high sec. ok.
---
Oof big woosh man
---
Being mobile in low sec is also good for staying alive if your mission gets unwanted guests.

few years ago anoms rate refresh was better, local in null and cynos. are you saying blackout is diminishing organic content?
---
a long with everyone who doesn't like to mine/rat and want to spend as little time having to do so as possible.
---
Can confirm as a daily roamer we get rolled all the time by the elite defensive gangs from the null blocs.
---
People are, I feel understandably, upset that a style of gameplay they liked (using capital ships outside of organized alliance level ops or high effort multi-account play) is essentially getting deleted from the game.
---
Newbro here, what is "the way of Bob"/"praise Bob" that I keep seeing

Good write up of your eve career, glad you found your vocation.

Serious question: Is the horrid interface lag ever going to be addressed?
---
It's thrilling to explore with a cargo worth 10x times of your ship. What hurts me is losing my loot because of really bad decisions I make time to time when I shouldn't most
---
Personally i have mined and ratted in blackout. It was fun cause i had to adjust my fit in case i got tackled. Also its brought more people to coms and given us more reasons to coordinate. 
---
I like black out. If it makes people happy put a module for specific structures to show local on a tic to tic basis. Something like that
---
I disagree that your answer and logical, and i am hardly pissed or screaming.  I feel your answer is moronic something, but that’s just because it isn’t rational.
---
and on your own words, i won’t indulge such a self-entitled child anymore
---
You must have me confused with KiLoAlPhA
---
Dont you guys get it. CCP doesnt like extra work lol.. How do we fix local in null: no local.. how we fix cynos: bam no nore cynos on 95% of ships 😂😂
---
yep
---
You're right

I definitely haven't been hazing your ustz in fountain kek

It seems that people would rather not play then play with risk

I use a Jackdaw for Angel DED 3 (avg completion time 15m) and 4 (avg completion time 10m). Less shiny, and this fit has an align time &lt; 2s with max navigation skills, so you can easily GTFO or bypass gatecamps.

&gt; "taxes increased by 50%"
---
they already increased them by way more than that lol
---
That doesn't invalidate his point though. You still choose to be a goon linemember. That groups are more accessible today has nothing to do with that.
---
What he is saying is it not worth taking the fight because if you cant gurantee your forces getting into system it better to write off the losses rather than increasing your losses.
---
Yes the prices of ships would sky rocket. Losing ships would hurt. Losing assets would hurt. A Lot.
---
Now add to that, removal of asset safety and you would see people really commiting to defend their homes and their goods or risking losing everything.
---
TBH I find it way more appealing then dropping caps for the lol's, watching titans being sold at 30B, or watching "defenders" just leaving everything behind without a fight.

THIS SEASON ON AMERICAN GREED
---
When I started playing I once asked in local whether anybody needed a logo pilot. Hauling corp tried to recruit me on the spot.
---
Can i have your stuff then? Ill find a use for them in the new system.
---
um you forgot there were some plex sales in there that actually drove the drop also
---
Of course they did. 😁
---
Given that now it's pretty dumb to be out in a capital engaging in PvE content, the *only* capital pilots you're going to find will be in that category.
---
Next I think CCP need to nerf capital use in WH space.
---
So if you’re okay with accepting that, then how can you not accept
---
Have a neut falcon or arazu/lachis with damps
---
Research wardec history and reach out to previous WT
---
Ask people around you for help along with previous WT
---
Keep your logi in corp, have everyone fit ecm drones
---
Done, neut logi solved and best thing, its not a lame solution like the ganking advice everyone recommends.
---
Bring neut logi back and remove ganking from HS. Problem solved.
---
Blackout is a good thing.
---
make the tax scale logarithmic and i'm all for it.
---
The reason is, hubs are good business, for both the buyer and the seller, their importance comes out of the velocity at which transactions happen (ie: often), but it should be taxed accordingly. A broad distribution of hubs makes niche opportunities available in different locations, but at some point the tax should even out, so overcrowded hubs behave similarly everywhere.
---
I really like the idea of there being no direct highsec to highsec routes between the empires; it makes sense in the lore, it makes the geography of Empire space more interesting, and it encourages the creation and growth of local economies.  BUT there's a problem - it would kill certain playstyles; incursion running, highsec ganking, and highsec courier logistics jump to mind.
---
So add a bunch of lowsec between the empires, but also add a handful of empire-run ansiblex jumpgates connecting the highsec edges of the empires to one another too.  Usage of the empire jumpgates would cost a moderate amount of ISK based on ship tonnage and also some percentage tariff of the value of goods in the ship's cargohold (say like 5% or 10%).  This adds player choice instead of eliminating it as well as adding another ISK sink to the game.
---
Same
---
Yayayayayay..... 1 question though is there a dark mode anywhere I really struggle going from the darkness of eve to the stark white of pyfa. I dont mean to ask for it I'm just wondering if I've missed it and it already exists.
---
Well, this is what I enjoy and earns me the isk which I'm okay with losing as long as my net gain is higher. And It's many times higher. I dont give a crap about having high isk/hour or making the perfect/most efficient/safest thing, If I can spend my isk on something I want without going bankrupt then It's all good for me
---
&gt;It is not the fault of ccp that people are leaving the game
---
:thonking:
---
Actually its the perfect reason. Quit right before it sucks you in and then later on CCP anal-probes your feelings with “balancing changes” 😂
---
OP this is the real answer if you want to kill it and not run.
---
Barghests are used because they have a range bonus and more *missile* dps than any other battleship in the game. Blitzing L5s with BS is done by MJDing to a range where the NPCs can't apply (much) damage and sniping triggers/mission objectives. A rattlesnake would be useless because the need to work at great range means it wouldn't be able to use its drones, and its lack of a range bonus means it'd be unable to shoot fury missiles to the necessary ranges.
---
Blackout and the cyno changes are both good for EvE.
---
Listen dude. Being disruptive towards a group means just that. I didnt make up the words or told Rise to use them did I? No matter the feelings on the subject they are specifically nerfing super umbrellas and they are going after NS.
---
The post that I replied to is a guy who is saying that CCP never said anything about nerfing umbrellas. Which is wrong.
---
Now the response to your post. Making things more tedious is an awesome way of making people stop doing things. I dont mind strategy, in fact I like that the most in every game. But this isnt strategy in that sense, its just tedious and just requires a higher skilled alt by your side. It will just make things uncomfortable and thats another way to make people quit that specific activity and even the game. 
---
And they do hate the blocs. I mean its between the lines. Listen to how they are saying things and not just what theyre saying. 90% of communication is non-verbal after all. Besides, you cant just go after one playstyle and then say, ye its nothing against you guys. NS is public enemy nr 1, thats a fact. CCP Rise even admits on that pod that they could have gone other ways but have chosen the nuclear option just because it was the nuclear option. And you somehow think they did this because they have no hate towards NS?
---
The meta isnt gonna change. Which is the main issue my friend. I have personally been advocating to change the meta for years since its shit but none of these changes will actually do that. The way it seems atm is that were gonna get a ton of changes but no relevant ones so in a years time we will be sitting there with more broken things and no changes that we actually needed. In such a scenario I can pretty much promise you that you lost massive amounts of players for no reason other than disruption for the sake of disruption.
---
if you want a regional trading hub, make one. the Tools are there.
---
If you want to liquidate assets then just undock, either your asset will be liquidated or the from another player, I would call that win-win.
---
Solo? Basically none.
---
Solo C5 marauder used to be possible, about 50 minutes per site and earning 300m for the effort, but now that you can't refit with a weapons timer (and bastion gives you one, even if you're not shooting players, wtf ccp), it's really, really bad. You need 2-3 smartbombs to reliably and quickly kill frigates, while also needing 2-3 Noses to keep cap up under the battleship heavy waves, and you just don't have enough high slots for that. Used to be able to just refit between them as needed.
---
I've yet to find a marauder fit that tanks 2200 DPS, has a positive cap regen of +72/sec, has 2-3 smartbombs, and does enough DPS to break through sleeper logi. Check off all four of those and you can solo C5s at 45-50 minutes per site, though.
---
Petition CCP. We had someone in Waffles (unless you're them?) just resub after 3+ years in the exact same situation. I haven't kept up to hear what their resolution was, but if it's happening to multiple people after prolonged absences I'd imagine it's something on CCP's end.
---
I agree. Which is why nerfing things based on the guy is a stupid way of developing a game.
---
How the heck do you even get negative isk?
---
One thing I am upset with about blackout is not seeing friends and allies!! Space is so lonely now...
---
Sure I spend time on comms with friends all night but waving at a neutral, seeing random reds who also happen to be old buddies, you miss out on some of the social aspect.
---
Oh man that sounds like a bittervet problem, and not like a gameplay problem. In those 8 years that your group has played you never had to change up what you were doing? If you are too complacent to try new things you need a break from eve.
---
Wait, humans are risk averse!? This is totally new information...
---
If you want people to rat with risk, you need to increase rewards and make it more of an interesting team activity. Right now it's solo grinding for less money with an almost certain level of loss.
---
Send in a support ticket to CCP.
---
Also set up Two Factor Authentication for ALL your accounts so something like this is less likely to happen in the future.
---
The only way negwalleting usually happens on an individual is due to buying rmt or from time to time people will buy rmt firesales on accident and CCP will slap them assuming it was intentional. I haven't personally heard of a single person getting it for anything else.
---
I literally have no idea. This is a first for me. But I've been out of the game for a long time and just starting to get my bearings again.
---
If CCP think you bought isk/items, then they will often take it back and then some.
---
Yeah, I've opened up a ticket. Gonna see what they say.
---
Well I hate to break it to you but due to over fishing and deforestation by CCP Corporation the local Retard Krab species has become a rarity even in Delve.
---
Well in a legitimate RMT situation, it's done by CCP removing the ISK. Say you have a wallet of 0 ISK, then buy 2b via RMT, and then you spend all of it. You're now back at 0 ISK. CCP catches your RMT transaction and removes 2b from your wallet, so you're now at -2b.

---
Legend!! Thanks for your continued work.
---
&gt; then they will often take it back and then some
---
They don't take it back and then some, they just take away the RMT'd quantity. If you had spent a bunch of that ISK, when they take it away you go negative ISK. If you buy 10b via RMT, don't spend any of it, and get caught, CCP just removes the 10b and gives you a spicy warning.
---
Sure, if we want to use that kind of an interpretation, fine. It's N+1. If you want to field a massive super fleet onto a hostile grid you should need to bring more than 1 cyno.
---
&gt; You keep saying cynos don't die now. That doesn't make it true.
---
It totally does. Lots of cynos live even when dropping onto a heavily hostile grid.
---
Who is talking about capital cynos?
---
We've been talking about hics, and dics, and interceptors, and cruisers, and t3s.
---
Well, yeah, stripping all the context away any minority having absolute control is horrible for the health of the game. You definitely remember that even back then the blue donut was a thing, and that the few major wars we've had were short breaks from stagnation, the exception being (from what I heard, I was too young to be playing at the time) the early era of nullsec with the fragmented, small alliances everywhere. We've all heard the epic story of BoB and we remember things were happening on a whole different scale back then.
---
And if you actually take context into account, what do the major alliance leaderships want nowadays? Certainly they don't like meaningful conflict or shifting borders, otherwise the last war in the north wouldn't have ended with some citadels being traded and a NIP being signed. Years ago, we'd be fighting for space, but I didn't see anyone moving into Pure Blind or Fade(I think? the one north of Fountain) after goons burnt it down last summer. Just some INIT renters and some nobodies that were allowed to exist there as a buffer. We didn't fight to take space, we just kicked over some citadels and dunked some ratters and rorqs. NC still live in Branch, GOTG are still more or less in the same place as a couple years ago.
---
I never said the game used to be healthy, don't put words into my mouth or put up straw men. What I did say is that nullsec is gettng more and more stale and it desperately needs to be shaken up, big time. I'm not even in nullsec largely because of this, I just kept the flair because there's some friends of mine in Bastion I actually really enjoyed playing with, and for the occasional funny response.
---
Hmm as i know each member of the CSM was a representation of all the people of the game not just what that person wants..
---
Which would kill the economy quicker than you might think and only result in people not actually fighting.
---
Right now there is already a an aspect without asset safety, industrial complexes. But do you see posts after posts about how people are rushing to kill them? No, which means that we already have somewhat of proof that removing asset safety wont actually create more fights.
---
And you are missing another point with that. What happens with the losers? You think just because you want to defend your home you will be able to? So what happens if you lose everything. Youre gonna stay in the game? It will kill off so many players so fast.
---
Titans dont cost 30b to build. Just because someone maybe does it doesnt mean that its viable. I see people gifting them away, does that mean titans are free?
---
who knows but I am OUTRAGED BY THIS LOSS
---
Wtf you scan just as much hunting in null as you did before. Blackout didn't change that. WHs suck when it comes to scanning cus you also have to roll the holes that suck.
---
Indeed. The awareness of you could lose everything in a matter of time after you undock makes it enjoyable for me. If there was no losing it would get boring pretty soon
---
But the reddit narrative about supers being unkillable....
---
Do you still have all your skills? It's possible the account was hacked and extracted then used for rmt.
---
It's not interface lag, it's complex issue of various backend delays:
---
- stat calculation is not really efficient
---
- commits to database take significant time
---
I do not think it will be fixed in current incarnation of Pyfa. We will take care of that in rewrite, though - but it will take at least a year to put something out.
---
Wait, I thought we were talking in a world where people actually try to strategize? Not one where people just try to complain louder?
---
Nothing is really changing with the ability to overall get onto hostile grids.
---
You just have to put in a tiny bit of effort now.
---
"...in the thousands of C5 holes ive rolled over the last few years..."
---
Given that there are only 2600 WH in the game... and only a portion of that are C5s. sticking your face into the same WHs over and over hardly counts as being different each time.
---
For my 1.6b/hr static subcap krabbing I used:
---
3 tinker rattlesnakes
---
1 drifter tanking passive rattlesnake
---
5 purifiers
---
1 salvager
---
You do the drifter (from the previous site) at one side (the rattle tanks, purifiers DPS but you can also use any other non-BS dps ship like oracles etc), and do the next site at the other side with the tinker Rattles. It's pretty nice sustainable money. Low mass. And since you don't need the Rorqual you can do it from a C2 C5/null.
---
my playstyle is to hunt the hunters and this makes it much more challenging and fun while simultaneously not giving my prey a heads up in advance... I don't know whre you are getting this "hate blackout" thing from
---
It's a little more complex than that. All prices are cached to not overload price services with request. Default cache expiry time is 24 hours. When you switch price source - old prices are still valid. You can clean them up manually though (preferences - database - delete all prices).
---
Price optimization enforces 2 hour validity on items, i.e. every price older than 2 hours used in currently open fit will be refreshed. So you're encouraged to use it every time before you're going to buy a ship.
---
Give it a 1-2hr timer. Enough time to allow a response fleet to form but short enough a fleet could reasonably stick around to camp and destroy it.
---
It adapts to OS theme - so no in general, yes if you can set dark theme to your OS. For example, it's quite easy to do in Linux.
---
You talked specifically about stagnation linking it to how a minority shouldnt have that much power, I didnt do that. And you presented it as a new thing. I just checked you on it because stagnation has always been a thing and it doesnt really matter who holds isk or not.
---
The reason why Im even doing this is because there are no simple solutions. Who holds isk or power isnt all that relevant, its the lack of reasons to fight that matters. And none of the changes made will change that.
---
I.e., stagnation isnt because of what players have done, its because of lack of incentive to do otherwise. Its a CCP issue but none of the changes will achieve anything in that sense.
---
It can get confusing, since as you apply mods and skills the drone always says the same amount of damage, but that damage multiplier changes.
---
Not sure why they implemented it that way, but I assume it's so across multiple damage types it has to do less calculations.
---
&gt; Hmm as i know each member of the CSM was a representation of all the people
---
Your knowledge is false. There are conflicting interests among playstyles (cyno changes case in point), so nobody can represent everyone. I got elected explicitly saying that I won't be representing the null mega empire linemember. You have 7 other representatives of your playstyle.
---
hehhhhhhhhh
---
God no, I have 20 omega accounts and 1 alpha. There are 3 name placeholders on extra slots. Alpha was done before logging everything else in end masse
---
&gt; other than for skill books
---
you can "buy and inject" every skillbook that is sold by NPC orders directly from your character sheet, up to and including the titan skillbooks
---
can we get an f in chat, folks?
---
But, according to everyone here, right now you can't guarantee your forces will get into system because cynos can be insta blapped by supers, but aren't, for some reason.
---
So it sounds like nothing is changing.
---
PKI developer here, you're incorrect.
---
Yea I said that wrong, ty for correction 👌
---
Does that change the fact to no longer be true?
---
That makes sense, thanks! I actually didn't know that function even existed, it's super useful
---
Yeah and all what we see from your part is how much you want easy kills with 0 effort, you want to kill everything in the game with your small ships just becuse its what you like. The mainly diference of eve vs other games are the big battles with the big toys, if ccp remove that i hardly belive this game will get new blood, and if i wanted only small gangs for kill things this will be my last choise of a game lol there is alot of other pvp games for that.
---
I would try out wormholes again, but the problem is, they're not Black Rise, so I just can't.
---
Person who doesn't know what PKI stands for here.
---
you need a friend to pilot ewar with. that way you guys can alternate jamming on damps and other targets, you would need to stop trying to jam someone thats attacking you and let your buddy do the cycles until he gets the jam in, and then you would need to start up. best thing for that is to right click the module and set it to auto repeat off. fill the high slots with defender missiles smart bombs or other tactically sound utility for the given fleet comp/ship you are piloting. and for the ones saying you can't jam out enemy ships, well...... drone link augmentors (3x) and hornet/vespa ec 300/600's will be very worthwhile. use the drone speed mid slot or rigs for utility for those drones, and your kinda golden there. however that does require a very good rng prayer, but it's worthwhile. if your fleet all has drone bays, then consider being the only ewar pilot on the field with the fleet comp all including ecm drones to back you up and keep you safe from damps or long range hitters. also consider the ecm burst modules (dont know if they have a cruiser sized one) but they can be quite effective at removing any tackle that somehow manages to get on top of you. ewar isn't the kind of piloting that most of these people do, so they dont know some of the more intricate tricks to using it. they were all old school mechanically challenged ewar pilots that just set it on and forget it style of play. those that do know this stuff probably just forgot to say it or i didn't read their comments. however, considering im going for the most negative karma on reddit, please downvote this comment even if you found any of this advice worthwhile.
---
Makes sense - if you check the drone window, it has a damage modifier in green. I checked and my lights II were like double the overall damage mod if some random medium Is based on my skills and bonuses.
---
The more you learn...
---
I very much doubt it, as it would probably require a significant rewrite. I tried to profile it once, and the conclusion i came was: it does a db query on almost every action, and ORM that is used is slow af.
---
Thank you for all your hard work on this dude. I do have a feature request for pyfa3 tho. I want to be able to theorycraft fits on my phone while I’m poopin at work. Can u help me with this?

Would be curious to hear your rebuttal to his response, rather than you just calling irrational
---
&gt;Next I think CCP need to nerf capital use in WH space.
---
They did. Now stop being a salty nullbear and throwing a tantrum.
---
Amen.

Then you could go for the end game and quit like ccp has convinced more than a few peope to do.

---
&gt;Sure, if we want to use that kind of an interpretation, fine. It's N+1. If you want to field a massive super fleet onto a hostile grid you should need to bring more than 1 cyno.

So what, exactly, in your mind does N+1 mean?
---
It's not an interpretation. It means to bring more of something.
---
&gt;It totally does. Lots of cynos live even when dropping onto a heavily hostile grid.
---
You don't fly caps, or you would be trying to force this. They don't. They might accidentally survive, but you can't plan on it.
---
Tell me this: if caps aren't really good at killing subcaps, which is exactly what you are implying by suggesting that subcaps cynos don't die on capital grids, why exactly do you want capitals nerfed so bad?
---
Your who argument is not based in facts or logic. It's pretty much degraded to "no u" at this point.
---
I'm honestly leaning toward StainGuy on this one. The cyno change is going to fuck with hunting supers. Yes, I know there's a workaround, but it adds time/opportunity for the super to escape and that's lame. We'll see though.
---
I feel you.  When all these l33t hunters dont have shit left to kill,  they'll be asking ccp for more capital targets.
---
Barghest has longer range without the increase in damage delay.
---
Weird request but yeah, was useful, earned a downvote, thanks for the advice
---
Nay thee
---
&gt;Wait, I thought we were talking in a world where people actually try to strategize? Not one where people just try to complain louder?
---
No, you're talking about a world that makes things needlessly more difficult and breaks something that isn't broken. Literally no one complains about block war cap fights.  I'm trying to save my favorite play style, because I know how hard it is already to get a supercap fight, and this just makes it harder.

---
Learning Pvp also includes learning how to avoid fights that you are likely to lose and not get baited as op did here
---
Wonder how many of them are goon sock puppets.
---
&gt; So what, exactly, in your mind does N+1 mean?
---
N+1 in EVE parlance is normally referred to large scale strategy simply requiring the winning side to bring n+1 of the current top capital. Like ust bringing more titans decides the fight.
---
Bringing more of different strategic assets doesn't fall into the EVE usage of N+1.
---
And by that count, avoids the problems that EVE has with N+1. 
---
&gt; They don't
---
oh...yikes....
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyazOaxDtIo&amp;t=832s
---
&gt; what you are implying by suggesting that subcaps cynos don't die on capital grids
---
My point was actually not that they don't ever die, or that caps and supers can't kill subcaps. My point was that subcap cynos have little issue surviving long enough to get the fleet it, at which point killing the cyno does little since the fleet is now the threat.
---
&gt; why exactly do you want capitals nerfed so bad?
---
Citation needed.
---
Where do I mention wanting capitals nerfed?
---
I'm not complaining about the cost of cruisers, I'm complaining about the inability of them to replace the ships they are supposed to replace.
---
I don't care about the super umbrellas. Nerf the fuck out of them. I don't care about moving ships, I use recons to move myself anyway because it's faster.
---
But FFS, leave the honest to God, supercap on supercap blockwar fights alone.
---
This can't be understated enough. The wormhole community keeps to itself a lot more than null/lowsec does. Hundreds of spicy fights happen every year and only the big nasty 30b+ brawls and a few evictions ever seem to hit Reddit. The majority of wormhole discourse and shit talking seems to happen in the wormhole discords. People like hunting in null/lowsec but many high class groups might not leave the c5/c6 highway for days.
---
A real spodbrain...
---
I mean if he's a good boy maybe he'll get internet privileges in prison and we can lure him this way.
---
Goons would intentionally blap a KS, bubble the wh, and stage titans around with DD's.
---
&gt; needlessly
---
So totally uncounterable mass teleportation of an entire supercap fleet of unlimited size to anybody anywhere with no considerations is good?
---
I would say this added difficult is needed.
---
&gt; breaks something that isn't broken. 
---
I would say it only breaks the broken parts of the way things were. Others agree.
---
&gt; Literally no one complains about block war cap fights.
---
Those aren't the primary use of cynos or capitals.
---
&gt; I'm trying to save my favorite play style
---
Cool, your favorite play style isn't particularly affected.
---
[This site](https://eve-offline.net/?server=tranquility) is way better.
---
you didnt know? We own those also.
---
lol you aren't even trying anymore
---
---   People will easily adapt and still escalate capitals.
---
I love how you make your claims beliving that theyr are facts.
---
---  It never leads to capital vs capital fights and is cancerous way for capitals to oppress subcapitals. 
---
Again, you claim in your imagination that never leads to capital vs capital, and why is cancerus? becuse its not your playstile?.
---
---  Part of the point in this change is now subcap pilots know which ships can actually drop capitals, and can avoid them.
---
So you also want to kill that content, becuse the people who likes to drop capitals on other things its not your playstile.
---
----  Not every super will be constantly accompanied by a recon. Most of the time they will be bridged from the home system to a cyno beacon etc, and the roamers will have a chance to prevent them from warping to the grid.
---
So again, all need to be super safe for roamers but not for the capitals becuse  its not your playstile.
---
---  Even if all null capitals will now have accompanying recons, at least the roamers will be able to kill the recons. That alone will suffice an entire night's content for the hunting side and a good compromise.
---
Omg so again your idea here is my gang needs to kill things easy.
---
Every post of you its i want to kill things easy with alot more value that what i bring, and the funny part is you claim that "this is good for the game" lool.
---
make a reddit thread about it and tag CCP Falcon and possibly a GM.
---
Logged in every day of the event
---
Definitely alts. It use to be most people would have a "sitter" that you swap to your main before you use them. At this point with injectors most people have turned their "sitters" into their main super pilot for more convenience.
---
Public-private key infrastructure?
---
&gt; Yep, even with implants it doesn't go that low. I know it's not important but still..
---
Crash booster.
---
Hell yeah, glad to hear it.
---
Keep in mind, factions hate each other. Caldari and Gallente, in lore, aren't trading much.
---
probably not as many of the " hi i started playing 3 days ago and this is why the blackout is a good change" sock puppets
---
but i though supers in delve were unkilalble because umbrella?
---
If we were realistic, Concord wouldn't have super ships. They would fly the same stuff as everyone else.
---
We love you too  
---
When are you applying
---
There are many who believe going for targets under the umbrella is a waste of time
---
CCP and the desert makers don't care about PVE.  They are still trying to squeeze the nul sec carebears out of their lethargy to actually do some PVP.  And don't forget all the money they are loosing from those Trillions of ISK that they are using to fund their accounts.  That also has to stop.
---
I think CCP (before the desert makers) fell into a great hi sec pve game by accident; but it was great fun while it lasted. :)
---
All that requires is enough of you to want to do it.
---
Yes, they don't like the risk. Some people (most) prefer ganks to high risk assaults.
---
Absolutely. I use the Rook frequently. The advanced electronic warfare frigates are also great.
---
There was a comment about using Damps over ECM. They definitely have different applications and damping your opponent especially in a fleet situation is definitely more powerful. But ECM has its place in the fleet as well and I pretty much use it quite a bit with our fleets because it really does well against enemies logies.
---
we MUST create nature preserves! it's an endangered species!
---
&gt; N+1 in EVE parlance is normally referred to large scale strategy simply requiring the winning side to bring n+1 of the current top capital. Like ust bringing more titans decides the fight.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Bringing more of different strategic assets doesn't fall into the EVE usage of N+1.
---
I mean, if you want to redefine N+1 to specifically mean whatever the fuck the "top capital" is, go ahead. you're on your own.  As long as I've been playing it's always meant to bring more of something.

 It's on a cap for all i can tell.

you really haven't responded to that except to repeat your same bullshit over and over like that makes it true.
---
Also, you never responded to [this](https://clips.twitch.tv/VivaciousBlatantPastaKlappa) which is way, waaaay the fuck more common.  How many caps could have you jumped through to that cyno?
---
&gt;Where do I mention wanting capitals nerfed?
---
since you're either a complete fucking idiot, or pretending to be one, I'll be as clear as possible:
---
A nerf to cynos is a nerf to caps.
---
die
---
Please tell us, in which way they nerfed capitals in J-space?
---
The nerf was obviously targeted at the ability of capitals to cyno in capital reinforcements, which mostly means umbrellas. 
---
If they were actually making an INTELLIGENT change and trying to reduce the ability of hotdroppers to ruin subcapital battles with caps, the changes would have been targeted more towards capital ESCALATION.  
---
In the latter scenario, they could have restricted the use of cynos to frigates and capitals, added a delay to the arrival of ships jumping to a cyno, and/or imposed a timer which briefly prevents ships from activating weapon systems immediately after a jump.
---
CCP being CCP, though, they probably consider hotdropping to be a wonderful "feature" of their game which should be encouraged and facilitated. After all, it certainly is "chaotic" to have what would otherwise have been an actual fight suddenly turn into a one-sided slaughter because herp derp caps...and who cares about such trivial matters as "fun", "balance", or "challenge" when you can have CHAOS.
---
I'm beginning to appreciate the efforts of the inquisition in 40k...I never realized how big of a threat chaos actually was until CCP showed us just how retarded it could be.
---
Make them drop male dancers.

only one group actively organizes r/eve disinfo campaigns, hope this helps

If all they ever did was tether when a neutral entered local before the blackout and then they stopped playing after it started then nothing of value was lost. When an npc I cant kill stops spawning does it really matter that it ever existed?

What would be the best way to go about that?

Goons would defend their space by any means necessary and make it very dangerous to go there.  FTFY
---
&gt; (They all had one flaw to their competence, they all let me in.)
---
Just for that, you get an upvote.
---
Capital escalations
---
is it whatever side isn't mine?
---
It can be done, bargest is just better at it. Just to get to 100km with drones you are giving up a missile launcher, and rattlesnake sentries have poor application at longer range. Ideally you would like to be well over 100.  Also most missions are a fair bit nastier than 10/10s. Comparable dps perhaps, just with lots of neut towers added in and better damage projection.
---
You can also go negative in your wallet by having contraband onboard and getting caught &amp; fined a few times. That's the only legit ingame way for this to happen.
---
Other than that there's a GM taking it from you as others have already mentioned, and it might not have been you personally but if your corp or alliance had been naughty and as a group had been fined you would also be affected (think AHARM).
---
Oh look it's a new pseudo-intellectual angle on 'gif local back reee'.
---
"Too safe" is when you can PVE in high reward space or sites, or otherwise generate large amounts of wealth, with very little risk of dying, even without a significant effort being put into looking for trouble. And "danger" is a threat to your ship or other assets.
---
High sec is okay because it's very safe but also low reward (though some rewards in high sec are, imo, too high).
---
Market PVP is ok because while you can make a lot off it, you're risking all the ISK you put in.
---
There is an argument that being able to bridge bomber gangs is not ok because the risk is quite low and the reward (in dropped cargo and in tears) is quite high. Cloaking in general is okay because while the risk of dying is very low, the reward is zero.
---
Local in null was not okay because it reduces the level of effort to reduce the risk to negligible to almost nothing (looking at a list of characters and being able to press 'warp' within a minute).
---
It is! With less catastrophic consequences. No one will drop an Avatar on your unpaid website. 
---
Or will they...
---
Swipe that card
---
He was out of range of the umbrella lmao dude was at like 40% armor by the time everyone midded so it turned into "yea you're dead" on comms
---
What do you mean by that? Did they changed wh mass and size restrictions?
---
That actually happened with some privately-run "pre-Sony" EverQuest servers that emulated gameplay from the earlier years. A few months in the rose-tinted glasses had fallen off and everyone realized that a lot of the so-called "features" they enjoyed back in the day were actually just barely tolerated because there simply wasn't anything more convenient at the time.
---
Just make Isogen-9. It's a weapon of mass destruction.
---
Since they removed the drugs from being "contraband" what would constitute that anymore?
---
Carrying slaves in minmatar space?
---
Not carrying slaves in Amarr?
---
&gt;-BBTB2, HPIC
---
Head Pussy In Charge? Trying to figure it out based on your post history sry
---
Wormholes are great. But that doesn't mean that null should still be allowed to be completely unbalanced risk/reward wise as it used to be.
---
The whole of Eve should be fun and balanced, not just wormholes and highsec.
---
no u
---
Well even static’s go to random holes of a given class
---
Yeah, no.
---
Why *do* people go for the pod, anyway? What's the point?
---
Back then it was a bit different. Could have been some of the narcotics.
---
🤣🤣🤪🤔😗😙😘😜✋✋👌🤞👊🖕😤
---
😂🔥💨🙌
---
Then define risk.
---
I'll look into that thank you.
---
&gt; And they created structures, both literally and figuratively, to defend their space. So now they're safe in the space that they own.
---
Being safe because you build and maintain stuff is fine (though that stuff is currently rather too easy to build and hard to destroy, but that's a different argument). Being safe because the game literally tells you the second a potential threat enters your system has nothing to do with that.
---
&gt; Space shouldn't have risk "just because", it should have risk proportional to the reward you get from it.
---
Yes quite. And with local, the risk in null is essentially zero.
---
Yeh lol
---
A small chance for an expensive killmail? That's what I was hoping for.
---
&gt; What you are trying to solve for is that everyone has now moved on to Supers and Rorqs. You can't put the genie back in the bottle and put everyone back in cruisers
---
Well you can actually do a lot about people using capital ships for anomaly PVE, and being able to drop them at will on a fight 5 jumps away.
---
That's not the right graph btw, the website is bugged. This is the subreddit data, that shows an increase in subscribers and active users post blackout.
---
https://mmo-population.com/r/eve/table
---
I'm not sure, but notice how they didn't kill the enemy cy is either.
---
The change to cynos is a nerf to Projection. Projection needed nerfing. More effort needed.
---
So your argument is that right now people choose not to shoot cynos, otherwise all cynos would die super quickly?
---
wait. you don't even know what they used to cyno?
---
they prob didn't kill it because it's a cap. you're actually a dumbass.
---
Damn. Away from the PC and none of the apps I have show it in the attributes. Found it somewhere online though. Thanks for the correction!
---
If people are looking for a fight and their FCs get them one, then is it really meaningless? It sounds like the EVE equivalent of a pick-up football game.
---
Shit. Windows dark theme still is too strange for me. Wish you could specify what apps it applies too. Thanks for the response.
---
What do you look for in an eve jobs posting?
---
I’m a new player rapidly approaching the point where I’ll need to join my first Corp to progress any further. So I popped on over to eve jobs and I then proceeded to thoughtfully type out a forty page biography of an LFG before realizing: yeah, probably don’t need all of that. I’m sorta bad at stuff like this....
---
So, what’s the stuff I should definitely include and what’s the fat that can be trimmed? What constitutes useful information? My time zone? Spoken language? PVP or PVE preference? 
---
What makes a good eve Resume?
---
We legit can't at all go for Delve Rorquals at belts even though we can go for supers and titans.
---
High sec should be safe, that's pretty much literally what 'high security' means.
---
JS is our future.
---
The only problem is that this future is terrible.
---
P.S. It's worth saying that even C++ is an awesome language, it's our past.
---
&gt; they have a range bonus 
---
The Barghest has range bonus (2x speed = 2x range) AND range penalty (½ flight time = ½ range).   
---
The end result is that its has same range as unbonused hull but the missiles reach their target faster (some rounding can happen to complicate things).
---
So damps or ECM, your advise?
---
You don't even consider PvP in your loot ship.
---
People in EVE don't fight you unless they think they can win. You had 700mil to lose vs 40mil in an engagement where your opponent behaved in a way where he believed he would win. He knows what ships you are both in. That should be enough to not just dissuade you from a fight but also convince you that there is a clear asymmetry of information.
---
Not really sure how that has anything to do with removing the sounds on a scouted (and therefore not closed) hole.
---
You can go a long way towards closing nullsec gates with a bubble camp. But yes, wormholes and nullsec are different.
---
Wingspan has a delivery/pickup form that you can fill out. They will be happy to liquidate your assets for you. Just contact a friendly delivery agent today and they will come to you.
---
There is so much wrong packed into these two sentences that even \*I\* am not willing to go to the effort of spelling it all out.
---
I'll give you a few hints, though, so you can devote some brain power to it and figure these things out for yourself.
---
First, EVE is supposed to be a sandbox game and any time you find yourself justifying something based on the idea that it "isn't the way it's supposed to be" should raise a mental red flag for you. Consider what ACTUALLY matters in a video game, and one that sells itself as a sandbox in particular.
---
Second, consider what state content will be in after having its risk:reward ratio reduced to an unacceptable level. Consider what short- and long-term effects this will have on the overall game, and compare the likely difficulty of balancing content in such a state to that of balancing content that experienced its balance changes the other way around. Look at the current situation if you need an example.
---
Finally, recall again the fact that this is a game. Consider the goals that should logically drive design decisions in a game.
---
&gt; "danger" is a threat to your ship or other assets
---
Also reading your responses in the subthread above I don't think it's worth trying to talk to you tbh
---
What's language of your choice for performance-critical modules?
---
As long as they save my 4 dreads on grid they can claim any credit they want lol
---
TIL sleips are t2 cruisers
---
&gt;100% safe
---
If this was true, no one would lose a ship. How are ships lost then?
---
Olmeca represents my playstyle. He got my vote.
---
Amazon
---
I don’t care what you think tbh.
---
of danger is a “threat” then the ability to be shot without consequence beyond self defense is truly danger. Only limited by the people trying to shoot you and their ability/effort to do so.
---
:) yeh man defenitly worth it as rupture is neat to
---
Why not just make it so that pods can't dscan - I'd think that's something that should be tied to the ships electronics?
---
No I mean to his wall of text that seemed like a reasonable opinion to me
---
&gt; EVE is supposed to be a sandbox game 
---
You don't know what a sandbox game means. A sandbox doesn't mean a completely unmaintained game relying on random mechanics which do not depend on balanced principles. You can't just throw in the word sandbox and expect it to be a counter-argument to against proposal for game balance.
---
&gt; Second, consider what state content will be in after having its risk:reward ratio reduced to an unacceptable level. 
---
Rise himself said if the risk is too high then they will consider upping the rewards. That's how you maintain a risk/reward balance. Umbrella nullsec being safer than hisec was -the- unacceptable status quo of risk/reward.
---
There wasn't just one cyno in that video.
---
How many did you see die?
---
I was thinking the main one was a hoc though, or hac.
---
So first of mechanics are not equal because players are not equal and groups are not equal. 
---
So any mechanic that makes it easier for an FC to take on more tasks of the fleet will likely favor groups with a high % of newbro's while any mechanic that forces members to do independent decisions will generally favor folks that are generally favoring groups that have more experienced players.
---
Now at it's core eve has the following problem: there is literally no reason not to field to most SP intensive doctrine as the barrier between that doctrine and any other is just isk. 
---
historically corps had to choice between having all there members in fleet or having less guy's but in more effective ships this is what made SP a good balance factor, today not so much. (yes skill injectors massively fucked the game up). 
---
But given there CCPs license to print money there unlikely to get fixed. 
---
So all other changes are working around this inherently shit mechanic trying to minimize the impact. 
---
So when you see grind removal in null it's not just about risk, it's also about catch up mechanics, there is almost no path to success for new groups.
---
Like the reason a lot of people are advocating for more content for smaller groups if i can't field a 100 in fleet right now well i might as well not bother going anywhere, this means those groups never really get to establish themselves, keeping a shrinking number of alliances as the sov holders.
---
Now all of this inherently comes from you get the most benefits from joining the team that is winning right now, this means everyone will sign up the winning team creating a winning feedback loop.
---
Now F1 racing is a great example of how this plays out ( if winning feeds back in more winning ) from 2013 on nobody outside of the top 3 has won a Race. 
---
Making ratting more risky and friends less effective is a way to limit this feedback loop, so that people that are on the winning team don't sprint forward to hard it allows smaller groups to give there line members some fun so they can grow over time.
---
It likely also makes the nano doctrines less common as right now the popularity of nano has to do more with the inability to use anything else then with it being the best fleet concept.
---
If you don't know what capital escalations are I don't think you're allowed to call for changes to wormhole mechanics, seeing as you're unaware of what they actually are.
---
Capital use in wormholes is already a pain in the ass, you have to build them in C4 and below (which has its own pains), you have mass limits for moving between C5s and C6s, and there's no cynos to make positioning easy as hell. That's on top of capital escalations making it a pain to use capitals to farm.
---
Cool, take a look over at r/fittings too.
---
(irl ofc)
---
dont like capboosters. and forgot put it in cargo=)
---
So your saying there is a chance null sec space will be freeing up? See ya bye.
---
The bots would just use plex my dude
---
this is so sad, but true
---
CCP is also reworking this kind of station wreck for some reason .... so stay tuned ^^
---
I dislike it. As someone who frequents(ed?) other people's space, I liked being seen. Made it take less time for a brawl to go down and I wouldn't have to tackle/kill dumb PVE ships and invite capital escalations.
---
What kind of things are those? I couldn't do them myself because I use to stand loud in the crowd so I'm easily recognisable. But just for the shake of knowledge....
---
* How much SP you have
---
* How you make your isk
---
* When you are available to play (your timezone)
---
* If you have a working microphone (this is a big one, recruiters want someone who can speak up on comms rather than a ghost)
---
* Your favourite ships to fly maybe
---
If you get those down then you should be good to go, overall some recruiters will take their job way more seriously than others so don't be put off if some dude wants to know your blood type before you can join his space guild
---
Good luck with that ticket, see you in a year!
---
because I don't like them. and I'm not very smart and forget to put it=)
---
ganker
---
and this for taloses https://pastebin.com/7zDhdWAm
---
that's not true, it has more range than an unbonused hull
---
it gets triple the missile velocity of an unbonused hull, not just double (it's a 200% bonus in traits, not 100%)
---
Or if they are undoing fraudulent transfers.
---
His account may have been used as an intermediary in a hacking.
---
That's not how bonuses work in eve - a 200% bonus means "base value + 200%", not "2x base value". The barghest's missiles move 3x faster than normal and have half the normal flight time, for a net 50% increase in range. You can confirm this by comparing them to a missile battleship with no bonuses that affect range, such as the typhoon fleet issue or the navy scorpion - a barghest with T2 cruise launchers and no other mods fitted will shoot fury missiles to 167 km, whereas a navy scorp or floon fit the same way will only shoot to 111 km.

Delet capitalism

Congratulations on winning the internet. Your distinction between "cruiser" and "battlecruiser" may well have redeemed a sinful humanity in the eyes of God.

Yeh man wasnt great lol my multi tasking skills are not quite on point yet we will get their thought.

---
Don't get snippy just because you were wrong. You have no one to blame but yourself.
---
Destructible NPC stations?
---
What are you talking about? I think u misunderstood my comment. I wasn’t complaining about anything.
---
All of their dead hictors had cynos fit, but [this one](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78533649/) and [this one](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78532988/) didn't have ozone, so they might have been the initial cyno, or they might have forgotten ozone. Sunffed is usually pretty good though, so I doubt they forgot.  Note that they both died.
---
About 1/4th of their dreads, and all of their apostles had cynos fit, but [this](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78533208/) dread and [this](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78533153/) Apostle didn't have ozone, and this [other](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78533282/0 Apostle only had 150 ozone, so I would guess that one, or all of those also lit cynos during that fight.  The thing with the 150 ozone, is 500 is the amount you need to light a cyno with cyno 1, so it's a common amount of ozone to include in contracted ships, but 350 is the amount you need with cyno 4, so for the dude to have 150 left over makes sense.  Most of their caps had 300 ozone, meaning they have cyno 5, and that's pretty impressive.  I'm guessing it's a required skill for their fax pilots.
---
edit: I'm probably off on my cyno skill level ozone requirement levels.
---
Too much ehp, infinite ore from moons, rorquals, sotiyos giving an infinite amount of industry slots per system with the upgrade.

Yeah, as much as I want to hate on snuff sometimes, this is a symptom not the cause. I'm with you entirely.

"We can't use capitals to invade many Wormhole systems but the people that own the Hole can use theirs to defend it, this is completely unfair! No one in Wormholes should have Capitals at all!"  
---
Like that? Cry some more...

That would be awesome

This is a question best suited to our [No stupid questions thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/ctx62l/weekly_reve_no_question_is_stupid_thread_august/)
---
The VNI you pay for is only 60m vs 1bil+ in hisec. If you spent 1bil+ on a ratting ship, you'd surpass hisec and if someone in sec spent 60m, they might at most get 20m/hr.
---
/u/lockly35 long awnser short.
---
It is between 180 and 300 mil in null.   
---
46 and 77 mil in highsec.
---
You generally need to be a lot further out than 100 km for L5s.
---
You don't know what the concept of sandbox means. A sandbox game doesn't mean a completely unmaintained game relying on random mechanics and not balanced principles yielding interesting choices. You can choose what you want to do in a sandbox, but a good sandbox game maintains a balance so there are different equally meaningful and rewarding choices. You can't just throw in the magic word sandbox and expect it to be a counter-argument against any proposal for game balance. A sandbox game still has to maintain a balance between playstyles.
---
One really inherent mechanic in how Eve maintains meaningful options is the risk/reward balance between different kinds of space and activities. The game motivates krabs to krab for money. The riskier the region/activity is, the more rewarding it is. Krabs in turn take risks for money, then die to players. This is how Eve ecosystem works and how everyone has a reason to play and subscribe Eve. Krabs krab. Hunters hunt krabs. Other people hunt the hunters. The food chain goes on. Eve has to maintain this balance, which means maintaining a minimal risk even in the most "organized" regions. 
---
We argue that nullsec faming should be riskier. Because so far, particularly capital farming under a supercap umbrella, has been this really low-risk activity that is distinctly out of balance option compared to other options. This meant the hunters didn't have enough content, and this meant the unchecked sheer farm in nullsec negatively affected the game's macroeconomy (faucets). The higher risk balances null farming back to a reasonable level, and transfers a more meaningful ratio of nullsec farm to explosions, kill and Eve content.
---
Just because we argue for a risk/reward balance, it doesn't mean we have to argue every activity should be riskier. Cloaking, safelogging etc is fine because cloakers and safeloggers typically aren't being rewarded by money and do not cause faucets. Mechanics like blops and cloaking actually ensures nullsec is risky for the farmers who do earn the money. Now, the real sandbox is in you having the choice to make cloakie lives harder. You can always choose to bait them, AWOX them, DD them, and so on.
---
PS: Here is the definition of krabbing risk btw - The amount you lose while farming / the amount you farm. There is already [data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1goutrhQADKczT9MLzA47Crdf3JwsVu5PNDHKN_qIvTs/edit#gid=92221620) on how it's low.
---
If you've got a C1 with a static High, that only means it always leads to some random High. It doesn't mean it's always guaranteed to lead to Jita.
---
Sure, that could work too.
---
Whole lotta dipshits here concerned about the corp ticker in the title of the video.

Thanks baws

did you know that working at amazon is great!
---
It doesnt seem to adjust in windows though. I run windows dark mode for a while now. Both windows and app mode set to dark.
---
Because FRT can't win and there fully aware of this, the only reason there not losing harder is because Test wants the content more then there space.
---
The reality is it's a stale mate and it will keep being one unless FRT becomes a real danger to test at that point you will see them quickly removed from that space.

I'm currently in Pandemic Horde and always try to go on 100% content fleets. Currently getting ready to go back to University so not logging on all the time anymore :(

Well done. You should be proud. And now we all know exactly what happens when something with actual teeth shows up on grid with you.

A scoreboard to be proud of!

Just go ice mining. You will get 1-2 wardecs within hours.

I'm not sure about C6s but isn't the mass limit on most C5s 3 million tons? 3 dreads in aren't coming back.
---
Jita was never in Yulai.
---
That's a really good idea actually. I was doing mobile depots, but secured containers sound better since they can't (easily) be scanned and I can store shit in it while I'm moving around.
---
You're right. Deep in my mind I know what I should or shouldn't do but when I'm out there flying a ship I just lose information I should keep track of, like autopilotting I don't really pay attention to things I should. I don't mean not to know what is going around me, I usually do, it's more of a not having a proactive thought process
---
&gt;Dropping capitals is putting them out to die if out escalated or baited.
---
Dang, that's so true. Brb, going to out-escalate Delve in their home turf.
---
&gt;What is "risk"?
---
Risk is the measure of the chance you have of losing your ship when you do an activity (which includes both pvp and pve). So a pve ship having high risk means that the pveer will lose it during their activities. Throwing a number out there, let's say that a high risk pveer loses 15% of their money in dieing (so for every 100mil they make, they lose 15m of ship), a medium risk has 7.5% and a low risk has 1-2%. For pvp, it's just the percentage of chance a mistake will make you lose your ship. Fighting outnumbered increases risk, blobbing decreases the risk.
---
&gt;Is "risk" just lacking the ability to fight back to you...?
---
Dude, I don't give a fuck about that VNI or any ratters for that matter. They're worthless to me, I want things that fight back. The only way a VNI could be useful to me is if I can fight the response fleet that comes back. 
---
&gt;Is "safety" just the ability to actually live in fights?
---
Not live, but stay on-grid without dieing regardless of my piloting. So, for example, I can't stay on-grid with my 5-10 small gang with a super, they will kill me everytime, even if I try to kite the fighters but I can stay on grid with a 40-50 subcaps, or maybe if there's a carrier (although it's probably the riskiest grid I'd stay on). If I'm fighting 5-50 subcaps, for example, and then someone drops a super, I have to leave the grid or die.
---
Staying on grid also doesn't mean winning the fight, just that I can get a good amount of kills with proper piloting. It's not like there's no chance I will lose my ship either, I might have a bil+ ship and a 1-2bil pod, but a wrong move and I'm webbed down and die.
---
Tried fitting a cloaky logi loki and it was reducing the large armor reps in PG incorrectly.

Have you ever scanned all of the Thera sigs?!?  This is a horrible idea. Like a really bad idea. I get keepstars are kinda the last special structures. But this idea really is bad.

Does an economist still work at CCP? Older articles mention Eyjolfur Eyjo Gudmundsson. I also recall CCP Quant existing, were they they same person / does CCP Quant still work there?
---
Galaxy's edge?
---
Except if you look at the rest of my scoreboard, I was one of those harmless explorers of 90% of my playtime. Either dying to rats or cloaky hunters. It's part of the fun of diving into J/null space is not knowing who could kill you. Also if all explorers made their way back, and all that sweet loot made it home and was cheap, then exploring wouldn't be worth doing isk wise.
---
Osrs, which has 5x the concurrent pcu of eve.

Check your assets and [personal contract history](http://prntscr.com/ow88on)

You'll probably find all your assets are gone, &amp; your character may have a private contract to another individual that explains where they went.
---
Yep, it's new bug for this release - has been reported on russian forums and [fixed](https://github.com/pyfa-org/Pyfa/issues/2026) already. Will be included in next release.
---
I always figured that when CCP created thousands of systems they envisioned more than 2 or 3 groups of nerds huddling up for safety.
---
the moment you nerf application all the super ratters will start screaming about there ratting ticks, there is also the whole dread/titan application thing that needs to be nerfed into the ground then as well. 
---
It would effectively mean isolating ships with jump drives to only apply on ships with jump drives. ( and maybe battleships )

The second time I got out in 2% hull. I was clenching

---
Problem with your whole interpretation of "nullsec is too safe" is that nullsec is not rewarding the risk, wormholes are.
---
The whole problem with CCP's latest changes are not the "make nullsec harder", it's the "let's do random changes without thinking".
---
Is local too powerful ? Probably so. Is removing local without any kind of balance a good thing ? Absolutely not.
---
Are supercap umbrellas too effective ? Pretty sure they are. Is, for the sake of the random small gangs, removing cyno from 99.9% of Eve ships, giving it to paper tanked ones, and never thinking about balancing it vs the rest of eve mechanics, a good thing ? Absolutely not.
---
CCP is never thinking about long term when they make theses changes (and I argue it's the same exact thing that happened with rorquals, anomalies, etc...), probably because they either lack knowledge of their own game's mechanics or either because they don't get the necessary time to do so (both?).
---
Most of nullsec people would tell you risk is fine if rewards are there. Most supercapital FCs would tell you it's fine to remove cyno from most ships as long as we have a replacement for capital engagement and travel.
---
But noooo, CCP had to do this "eRA oF chAoS" thing and throw thinking out of the window. You don't incrementally implement changes "to test the waters" on this scale, you think about it before and you hatch a plan.
---
The last 10 years have favored the null blocs. While nerfing covert ops and that type of play style.
---
yeah I mean the act of it being the main trade hub in eve... something something before they made gate changes the main hub was yulai.
---
I feel personally insulted.
---
&gt; I don’t care what you think tbh.
---
why write a wall of text to ask that question then?
---
ED is fun for 40 hours.

---
"Without significant effort"---see this is where I personally believe folks outside looking in get it wrong. What is effort? From an individual perspective, is it hard to Warp to a haven then go AFK? Assuredly not. But from a macro level, is it effort to:
---
-	Invade space
---
-	Secure space
---
-	Recruit, gain, train and employ members to be in your space
---
-	Build up space (infrastructure and logistic maintenance)
---
-	Encourage crabbing to build wealth and prosperity
---
-	Implement intel channels (and moderate them), programs, and solutions to ensure Karbs have ample warning of threats
---
-	Encourage mining and to build an industrial base to build ships and modules
---
-	Maintain fleets with rules of engagement, enforce discipline (e.g “Just don’t feed!”, “Don’t YOLO supers”), and readiness to respond
---
-	Have FC's ready to respond to imminent threats, small or large, quickly and decisively and in your favor
---
Etc etc I could go on. I think assuredly it is work—a lot of it. 
---
Point being, Null Sec didn’t become safe out of nowhere, it became safe because people made it that way. Individually, maybe the effort was small, or maybe even significant, but on the whole, as a team, signicant effort was made to achieve the result--security and prosperity. Which in my mind is what the sand box is all about—people doing things to create the content/environment they want. 
---
If sec status is a metric to determine the level of security of a given piece of space, then I would argue it’s not “Null Sec” in certain places, its “GOON-Sec”, or “TEST-Sec”, or “PANFAM-Sec”. And if you, in the pejorative sense, believe that those entities shouldn’t be able to protect their own space to maximum extent possible, as violently as possible, then we, again in the pejorative sense,  are going to be at an impasse.
---
It's more you can't remove multiboxing without making the game absolutely horrible to play. 
---
Like there are way to many roles in a fleet that take next to no input and are well not you fighting but are very much needed, so while multiboxing absolutely plays a apart in the power of NS income removing it well means the game is gonna suck for everyone, so you have to balance the game around it.
---
If only the bounty system wasn't useless 🤔
---
No, it's an event hosted by the GMs. But it's already over for today
---
dont be silly, ofc he wont do that..
---
Grrr why dont you feed into my hundred super/titans under fax reps like a real man.
---
&gt; They should have used fighter mechanics (which ccp hinted at initially).
---
I’ve heard a few people allude to this, but never saw a source. What would have been the ingame mechanic for this, just having to manually click on the mining laser module on excavs each cycle, similar to guns on fighters?
---
Blackout killing explorers hunting for relic sites!!1!1 REEEEEEEEEEE
---
Well then you're out of luck. It's up to wxwidgets to follow these settings and if they do not follow as advertised, then we can't do anything.

There's some chance that our hackish code somehow prevents it from doing so.
---
F

I think so ya. Who knows what other changes are coming too.
---
Ok calm down.
---
Dirty Jobs: Eve Edition
---
they were only able to make it so safe as a result of the mechanics provided to them. the end result is not in line with the vision of nullsec that many players, the devs and the wider public in general have of eve. Thus the mechanics that provide this safety are being revised so that the end result if more in line with the original vision.
---
So bring more cynos.
---
N+1.
---
Wormhole to stain*
---
A pleasure, an easy detail to miss
---
I care about what I asked, but your opinion of me and my stance is irrelevant to that point. 
---
I could have clarified that better.  Feel free to discuss/debate danger and risk and safety, but i have no interest in debating how horrible /stupid/whatever you need to call me type of person i am :p
---
I think it's 5million. At least I've read that people sometimes jump 2 dreads out and back for static farming and many statics are listed as 5m mass on the charts.
---
Hence, travel together.
---
You assume they need to come back.
---
Hopefully it's 5, since I want to do nomad wormhole stuff with 3 nags and a chimera plus other subcap pilots.
---
&gt; nullsec is not rewarding the risk, wormholes are.
---
No. Reward doesn't merely mean isk/hr. It includes many other factors:
---
- Afkability: Can you earn your money and yet attend a fleet?
---
- Scalability: Can you get more accounts and scale up your isk/hr?
---
- Sustainability: Can you farm as much money as you can if you kept farming 10+ hours every day?
---
- Accessibility: Can you merely join an alliance to access the farm, or will you need your own setup?
---
- Investment: How much prior investment do you need to start farming?
---
- Dedication: Do you need to dedicate your accounts to PvE to access the farming, or can you attend fleets? 
---
- Ship Safety: Are people able to come interfere with your farming?
---
- Infrastructure Safety: What is the possibility of you losing the access to the infrastructure that enables your farm?
---
All this taken into account, Rorqual mining in an umbrella alliance is the most rewarding activity by far. 
---
PS: I am not saying some of the above factors are not making it harder for Rorquals. For example 5b investment for 100m/hr return is quite high compared to other activities. But all of these bullet points taken together, Rorquals are the most rewarding.
---
&gt; We have a replacement for capital engagement and travel.
---
Capital engagement and travel is very much still possible. I have 7 dreadnought accounts that I regularly move. If anything, the non-mega empire people like me will lose more recons than anybody else, but we're not complaining.
---
&gt; CCP is never thinking about long term when they make theses change. You think about it before and you hatch a plan.
---
I think the long term plan is there, and CCP is thinking sufficiently on these changes. They just aren't opening changes up to conversation too much, because null mega empire linemembers always dominate the majority of the conversation although you are actually not the majority in this game. That's where the new "talk less do more" attitude comes from. It's because linemembers like you dominate the talk as many of you are interested in the social aspect of this game, while hunters like me are typically less interested in talking and the social aspect of the game (except me which is why I ran for CSM). So we are just skipping a lot of one-sided talk.
---
This is indeed an issue of resource distribution more than anything, but the blue donut is the end all be all to  basically every pvp sandbox ever
---
The only thing that gets in the way is ego, because working together provides more longevity, and in a game where you can lose literally everything longevity has far more appeal than ego almost always
---
Pick the race/character based on aestetical appeal to you. 
---
Nothing else really matters after maybe the first few days of training.
---
Drifters destroying Jita? That would be within the theme of the Chaos Era!
---
How long and how much does this take to set up?
---
Yeah, I get nagios alerts at a month, 2 weeks, 1 week, 5 days, 4 days, 3 days, 2 days, 1 day, 12 hours, 6 hours, 5 hours... and so on.
---
Also Plex tank failed yet again :)
---
The CCP tweet talked about a space elevator. Is that visible here?
---
Lol no. Very very few of them got shot. In fact, for the longest time people complained that Provi was not worth taking because of how many outposts there were and how little the payoff was to do it. Outposts and conquerable stations were all about strategic objectives, otherwise no one bothered. POS's were usually defanged and then left unless the moon was needed for strategic value or for moon goo. The number of sticks just left floating was ridiculous because there was no reason to remove them.
---
We now have a situation where everything is as boring to pop with the same payout as going around popping sticks. No one did it, just as no one does it. 
---
As far as talking about incentives, it is less of an incentive to maybe get loot than it is to have your stuff lost. Losing items for the defenders is where asset safety messes with things. You are correct that very very few will shoot structures to get the loot pinata however many timers later. They will however do so to deny their opponents access to their stuff. Just as outposts and conquerable stations were strategic objectives before this enables them to be again. Structures are a dime a dozen to the individual player. Their stuff that is in them isn't, because it is theirs and allows them to function. The current penalty of 5 days is laughable at best. It requires no work from the player and is more of a minor inconvenience than an incentive to do anything.
---
IIRC high-sec EC and refineries have asset safety on them. They don't drop anything. So I'm confused by your statement?
---
Changes to killmails are long over due. They are meant to show a player's losses and defeats. This would be a loss to players and provide extra utility. Killmails would have to change if structures dropped things anyways. I am saying that the change could be used to solve this issue as well, not "the entire thing hinges on this being changed." Two birds, one stone.
---
You are correct about potentially overloading GMs though, I will give you that. This being said, I am sure that anytime a feature is released they see a huge uptick in ticket. However this isn't some radical new idea, there is precedence here. Many players receive teleports from GMs after extended leaves. From my understanding, it is only one ship and anything inside it. I am taking this system, applying it to a smaller subset of people (only those whose stuff got completely destroyed) and saying this is a way to help deal with these edge cases. It is no more abusable or anything less to bitch about than the system that was already in place.
---
Updated station graphics. Chequezy!
---
I agree with this so hard. Any arranged stuff is just nonsense.
---
This was part of the GM roam FC’d and streamed by Bjorn Bee. It was pretty fun to watch. Poor Reddit thread title about it though, you kinda sound salty. Hope you aren’t ;)
---
&gt; something something before they made gate changes the main hub was yulai
---
Yulai used to be the most convenient, centrally-located system in high-sec, with gates leading to each of the other major regions. Hence it was very much the main hub until CCP re-arranged high-sec and Jita became the place.
---
Know your engagement profile. If you only do 5-600 dps you can’t kill ships with more than 1 logi on grid. 
---
Run smartbomb a if you have a second utility high to clear drone dps and scare little guys. 
---
Reduce transversal. Matching direction with the guy your shooting at will increase your application.
---
Know enemy ships. If they have lots of neuts DON’T bring active reps. If they have lots of faction/T2 cruisers know the squishy ones to clear dps as fast as possible. 
---
Use drugs and heat. They are your best friend for Eeking out a tiny advantage over your opponents.
---
Train your skills up. There is a huge difference between lvl 3 and V in most skills. Fly as close to optimally as you can.
---
My take on the usefulness of the word sandbox in balance discussions is that it should be looked at in the context of how much sand is inside, that is, how many different options and styles of play are viable, even if some aren't optimal.
---
Most changes are really, really hard do define as a positive or negative impact on the sandbox even AFTER they occur. Blackout made some playstyles much stronger (Blops drops), some PvP options that were not viable better (more small gang roams and brawling), and made activities less viable (baiting cloaky campers in system, single account solo pvp, some forms of PvE such as smartbombing battleships). At the end of the day, there's a ton of variables that changes.
---
A smaller change like the one to combat ceptors is one where it's easier to see clear damage to the sandbox. While the removal of 50 man arty claw fleets made some forms of entosis more interesting in terms of the fleet options you could bring, the idea of a combat interceptor is pretty much dead in the water as a fast, nullified, but heavier tackle option than a fleet ceptor. Combat interceptor hulls are obnoxiously cheap because people who had stocks of them from before the nerf still can't sell off those hulls, because they are truly useless in the modern era. A nerf that had removed arty claws as a viable entosis war tool (perhaps nerfing the align time of the combat ceptors overall or changing all weapon bonuses to ones for short range, missile, or drone platforms), but kept combat ceptors in something of a niche by virtue of their nullification, would have removed less sand from the sandbox in order to accomplish that particular objective.
---
You want local back? 
---
CCP (i.e. PA) will gladly charge you 50 PLEX per day to reactivate local.
---
as a new player, i have got to say, the amount of crying over this change is fucking pathetic. i thought EVE was meant to be a hardcore game; difficult and treacherous. it seems though that this was just EVE players stroking their own dicks. turns out a good bunch of you are bitches of the highest order.
---
Read again who was posting each post. I weren't calling for nerfs in usage of caps in wh space, I simply asked if there was any nerfs to usage of caps in WH.

---
Eve needs station design like in X: Rebirth or X4
---
&gt; My take on the usefulness of the word sandbox in balance discussions is that it should be looked at in the context of how much sand is inside, that is, how many different options and styles of play are viable, even if some aren't optimal.
---
I agree strongly with this analysis of the concept of the "sandbox".
---
&gt; Blackout made some playstyles much stronger (Blops drops), some PvP options that were not viable better. ... At the end of the day, there's a ton of variables that changes.
---
Blackout and cyno changes are reactions to the status quo under which offensive, selectively recruiting, nomadic playstyles were invalidated and defensive, non-selectively recruiting, large umbrella blobs were validated. Thus the changes do adhere to your principle above of "maintaining as much valid playstyle as you can".
---
I agree that these changes are really high impact and there will be unforeseen consequences, but CCP can always reiterate if it becomes too oppressive. Trashtalking them before they take effect, without offering any other viable alternative (aka the generic null linemember reaction these days) to solve the above problem of invalidation of certain playstyles, achieves nothing.

indeed burn jita get rid of those regional gates and only allow access to other people via low sec.

There’s nothing CCP is doing to hinder their efforts, merely changing the mechanics of the game.

Uhhuh

Ah man I feel so pathetic for the fact that I have died 30 minutes before you.  [https://zkillboard.com/kill/78565869/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78565869/)  and that players like you steal my relic sites and then die with the loot in the end.
---
I did this for... four days? for Waffles and I wanted to die. It only takes about 90 minutes if you ignore all the EOLs, low-secs, and high-secs that aren't blue (aka Caldari space near Jita). The first day it took me nearly 4 hours because I wasn't in the groove of it and elected to check every single WH that wasn't EOL, even the shitty high-sec and low-sec holes.
---
Fortunately we got a lot of good content out of it and enough people saw the benefit to pick up the torch and keep it going.
---
The problem now is that we'll get an entrance close to our own WH and then someone will scream about "rolling the static," at which point the next closest entrance is like 15 jumps away and nobody is willing to burn that far to stage out of the Drifter hole for the night.

Funny, I think they forget the kind of state the game was in, and just want their :feels: back.
---
&gt;But nothing will change the fact that the game is objectively worse today
---
everything about games and gaming is subjective. fun is subjective. you are invoking your opinion as fact, and then claiming its objective. 
---
your assertions regarding addition being better than subtraction are equally stupid. first of all, the removal of one thing is not absolute - in the case of Local, the reduction in perfect intel leads to the addition of something aking to 'fog of war'. what, at a basic level looks like removal, actually results in addition at many other levels.
---
these are my subjective opinions, and at no point would i ever try and claim that they represent some objective cosmic wisdom like you do.
---
All these orientations are player definitions for directions of the corp. Literally none of these orientations have an ingame system that specifies them as a corp that does these things.
---
As mentioned, going negative while you have been away only happens if you did something naughty.
---
I read that all you did was 'mined and sold stuff'  So you might of been accused of botting before you left eve and a gm finished an investigation, took your isk and gave you a ban (which you would not of noticed, though there might be an e-mail)
---
Or you real money traded, as in you bought isk from someone other then ccp and got caught.
---
All you can do is, as mentioned, petsion to see what happened.  You will then need to start doing activities to reduce your - number.  Selling off old crap might work.
---
Now if you did not do any of the above (sadly i don;t tend to give posters of this type a benefit of a doubt as in my 13 years here if i had a dollar for everyone one of these "i did nothing wrong!" threads that turned out to be they did something wrong, i'd be rich.)  Then you might of been hacked, check you assets, contracts, check your wallet logs to see if anything odd happened after you left and before you came back.
---
Good luck.

&gt;Point being, Null Sec didn’t become safe out of nowhere, it became safe because people made it that way. Individually, maybe the effort was small, or maybe even significant, but on the whole, as a team, signicant effort was made to achieve the result--security and prosperity. Which in my mind is what the sand box is all about—people doing things to create the content/environment they want.
---
This is a very important point, and I want to state up front that I agree with you this far: nullsec became safe due to significant efforts of significant numbers of people.
---
However.
---
When CCP balances, it's not enough to balance around the things people can do easily. They also have to balance around the things that people can do with effort. And because this is EVE, CCP will often have to do that balancing retroactively. We EVE players are the *best* at breaking systems with concerted effort.
---
For a small example, consider AHARM's C6 magnetar doctrine, made famous by [Rooks &amp; Kings Clarion Call 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrYe_4vHzgE). Until AHARM discovered how to underflow the tracking numbers, the magnetar effect did not need changes. It took AHARM significant amounts of research to discover the trick, significant effort to amass the resources to exploit it properly, and at least some pilot training to get their pilots used to a decidedly non-standard fleet doctrine. This is a laudable effort on their part. However, once the mechanic had been broken, CCP had to fix it.
---
The state of nullsec prior to the blackout was like this. Nullsec empires--particularly Goons--had done impressive and laudable work securing their space. But at the end of the day, their success broke the system, and CCP was forced to make changes to restore balance.
---
Sidenote: You may believe that nullsec was not "too safe" before the blackout. That's a coherent position for you to hold, and while I disagree, I can respect it.
---
Stop RMTING
---
modular stations that click together on specific hard points ?  (aside from the lag) hell why not
---
The idea been for a while. Make the sec status linked to players actions. If you farm toomany pirates on the missions in Curse it will became hisec eventually. Same with hisec. No farm no sec status. Then link the tax to it. 
---
That will bring real chaos :D
---
Someone that did buy isk must have gave you a large amount of it
---
Frankly I think both should die unsupported under these circumstances, but if CCP wants one to be able to tank, it should be the combat ship!
---
More events at 23:00-03:00 Eve time 
---
Even if they are scripted or clones from Early events from the day
---
But yeha, having a MMO its a 24/7 service
---
No bringing back local for the scared and terrified just quit Eve.
---
I've happened to .01 ISK someone by pure chance like 5 minutes after they've updated their own order and I know they hate me and think I'm a bot
---
The other night I logged on my trading alt and found someone had .01'd me on Bhaalgorns literally 30 seconds prior, poor guy
---
Yes you can go after one playstyle without any animosity If that playstyle is being propped up on broken and/or unbalanced mechanics and gameplay. If someone wants that crazy level of safety then I guess they’ll need to train a force recon alt but they could just pay more attention and use d scan and thry really won’t need an alt. You could also use lower skilled alts if that’s something you really want and just have them sit on the gates cloaked. That’s what I’ve been doing. Haven’t gotten banked yet. People staying docked are just babies who want a guaranteed out while they make isk pretty much afk
---
cap-chained rattles where one has a laser pointer to send the gecko's is also a great way to do it as all toons can be alpha's. "Tinker rattles"  
---
2 or 3 dreads is also a good one.
---
You can't sell the PLEX without having enough money for the broker and taxes. Only in-game solution (assuming CCP doesn't fix his account) is to get 787m isk somehow.
---
I still don't get it. But then I'm not the type of person who likes ganking people anyway, so it's probably just a matter of personal taste.
---
High-sec is definitely the place where people get *very* emotional about EVE, probably because they are new and get attached to their ships. I started out my PvP career by doing high-sec decs and can flipping in 2007-2008, and boy did those people get legitimately upset. People threatening me, my family, saying they had friends in BoB who would never let me leave high-sec again, etc.
---
Start "the only legitimate isk doubling service in new eden"
---
B-But the ore I mine is free, I don't understand this
---
I don;t think your suggestion will actually matter.
---
Jita became the hub due to route changes in the jump gates, that made it more or less center of the universe.  The players then chose to do all there trading and crap there.  Even messing with taxes won;t really make then shift away from it.  As the players decided Jita is where they want to trade.
---
humans are lazy.  People go to jita, because they know they can find what they want for the cheapest price.  Its why humans will shop on amazon, wait 1-5 days for the item to arrive, because they can find what they want for the cheapest price.  Its much easier to drive to your local best buy and buy stuff, but meh.  Same with Jita, everything is there.  no need to go region to region finding items.
---
&gt; but the blue donut is the end all be all to basically every pvp sandbox ever
---
true, sandboxes are vulnerable to n+1 mechanics. that´s why you gotta shit fury and thunder all over the people who promote and participate in that kind of lazy playstyle if you want to keep your sandbox running without going for periodic resets. one way or the other. i´m not saying CCP does it the right way but for the first time in years they at least acknowledge this basic issue and are testing the waters.
---
I didn't even think of that, I always overlook the fees
---
That’ll get him to -670m at best.
---
Unless he trade sold the rorqual and didn’t get scammed.
---
finders keepers, losers weepers but sometimes finders also weepers
---
I'm not sure if those are the same person. CCP's in-house economist left a while back. There had been another member of their team sending out the MER and stuff like that, but they may have been reassigned to other duties recently.
---
Since the introduction of citadels this is no longer a viable tactic and likely never will be again, so I'll share.
---
I used to run a racket where I'd blitz through high-sec probing down wormholes that had active corps (with POSes) in them. I then had an alt that only flew 100mn bumping Stabbers, with which I would convo anyone in the corp that was online (using contact list, which doesn't work anymore either). I'd basically lie and say "hey, it's me, &lt;guy who used to be in corp, name found on EVEWho&gt;, I'm back to the game with a fresh account!" This sounds like it might be against the EULA, but as long as your character name doesn't impersonate them, there is nothing that says you can't literally claim to be another person. I confirmed this with a GM back in the day, since I didn't want my main to get banned for profiting from this.
---
As soon as I got into corp, I would wait until there was nobody around and I'd start ejecting ships from hangars and bumping them out to my main. The benefit of my search method is that I already had a high-sec exit from the hole, and it's far less suspicious to try joining a corp you've already located, than to start blindly trying to join WH corps through their extensive recruiting process. Way faster turn-around between heists. Plus, I'd end up getting a lot of corps that weren't even based out of wormholes, it was just one or two guys in the corp with a WH operation, so they never suspected a thing.
---
There were a few days where I successfully robbed 3 corps in a 12 hour period. If it was an expensive faction POS fit, I'd sometimes try to say "Hey remember that old manufacturing POS setup I had in &lt;random system&gt;? I'm trying to set it up again but I don't have roles to anchor." They'd give me roles and I'd just tear down the entire WH pos when I was done looting, set up bubbles where it was, and then camp them with my main when they logged in later.
---
OP, you are the asshole....... wait, wrong sub

Get well soon and see you soon back in game.  your missed

Eve is gonna be real fuckin rough for you
---
Burn Jita YC122: this time its final
---
The damage rig is better, due a good shot can pierce a SAAR  tank till the hull. has less dps but only  2 or 3 units. It's better the extra alpha, with hail you even can pierce a double armor rep tank if your target is not orbiting.
---
I've used a similar fit but with a nosf, there is a variant also with an small armor rep and the nosf, which is cap stable, but I felt was better the SAAR version.
---
The armor fit with neut + td comes with a 200mm armor plate just to do not get alphad while you got the right distance, effective but very critical to use, it doesn't allow any failure. Nowdays less efective due neut range was nerfed from the old days.
---
For the MSE + neut fit you need to drop the tracking disruptor and lower the weapons to 125mm, that's my favorite slasher fit.
---

Welcome to the club mate.  Congrats on your victory.

You did read what I wrote yes?

Dunno, the only reason I wrote that is because it worked. You can hit cloak and still get an mwd cycle off after you hit the cloak.

you mean that time they were joining legacy and test didn't jump in their minnows to help?

Eve is a dictatorship, emphasis on being a dick.

id love booshing in highsec. going suspect would be interesting, would'nt you get gateguns for booshing in lowsec as a knockon?
---
both of u r dumb
---
the outer ring around the station in some of the images - could this mean npc stations to get tethering?
---
AmazingJay provided a good response about what information about your assets is good to share. You should also describe what you're looking for in a corp.
---
* Do you have a preference for type of space?
---
* What is your preferred day-to-day activity?
---
* Are there cultural elements you're looking for? (e.g. Maybe you have children around when you're playing, and want family-friendly comms. Or maybe you like to swear and want to make sure the comms *aren't* family-friendly.)
---
* How often do you want to get pinged?
---
Any sane corp wants that information because they want to find out if you'll be happy with them *now*. They don't want to find you you aren't happy two months in after you've moved all your shit. A good recruiter will draw this out of you and may even be able to suggest other corps that they know that might be a better fit.
---
next time suck up to him and get director then rob the corp of everything it owns, transfer its citadels to an alt corp, kick everyone, and contract the ceo a bookmark called "sensitivity training"
---
Actually WebAssembly is the future, and you can use any language you want.
---
&gt; Like there are way to many roles in a fleet that take next to no input and are well not you fighting but are very much needed
---
startlingly similar description to how you'd describe pve.
---
next to no input, and very much needed.
---
Let me.guess, highsec corp?
---
They're all shit.
---
Source: CEO'd a highsec corp.
---
Your point on good leadership is definitely appropriate. You didn't seem to even be that "sensitive" about it. He certainly was though.
---
Seeing the amount of trade happening there, I am amazed that a little upgrade didn't happen years ago
---
except you wouldn't because if you spent 1bn on a ratting ship in null it'd be a cap, because it's safer and better in literally every way.
---
you can also earn as much as a 1bn isk battleship in high sec with a 300m cruiser - doing the exact same content.
---
Only if your corp is shit. 
---
We love our logibros.

Not so much botting as bots tend not to loot. But depressed carebearing in general.

No man. It’s about the ~~cruiser~~ Force recon never surviving long enough to lite a cyno man. Back when I flee with MCAV we used  cyno Talwars in fleet battles to hotdrop a dread out to 0.0 for a fight. Cyno ships go down man. They go down fast. And force recons are paper tanks man.  You’re gonna need a few bil in recons per engagement bruh. 
---
I think only the major alliances will really fuck with it. Now if it were HACs. That’d be different. I feel more comfortable in their survivability and they’re assault cruisers. It makes more sense than cloaky ships.
---
What was the policy?
---
Funny...  
---
Total WH ISK Generated in Feb 2019:  11.5 T  
---
Total WH Losses on ZKill in Feb 2019:  138 B  
---
Total WH Risk Factor for 2019 including ALL KILLS and ignoring mining output: **1.2% RISK**
---
Since this is significantly lower than both LS and NS, we should make wormholes more dangerous right?
---
Yea but the sig bloom still applies and if they land the lock before the cloaking finishes then you never actually cloak. 
---
That is how you mwd trick with a dst but it can backfire pretty easily and I don’t recommend it if you’re not in a hauler.
---
&gt;he bought the dip
---
60 isk/unit still better than 15 tho, especially considering inflation
---
Yea I had quite a few nice conversations with neuts roaming around while in my rorqs
---
I agree and I have suggestions on increasing wh risk. Wormholers interestingly aren't nearly as whiney as nullseccers about the idea of more farm ships dying.
---
Still really strong against logis and still useful in "falcon punches" but now the ECM'er is lockable so you have to have range control and you can't just decloak 40 off, jam, and then just ignore the client. If you decloak 100 off, jam, align and remember to warp off if someone burns for you, you're probably OK.
---
"Solo" fit where jammer was dps as well are dead (i.e.: griffin navy basically.)
---
Only 50?
---
the other option is plex. Selling $5 of plex will get you a hell of a lot of t1 frigates to blow up.
---
I'm not sure, why?
---
While i do in a way get where you coming from, given you joined that corp like 2/3 day's before this convo happen, it seems a really unreasonable position to take.
---
Like generally in small groups there is no formal authority, other then some degree of opsec, so you often will get informal interaction. 
---
This means if you expect people in a leadership position to behave as if there professionally trained not to offend your gonna have a really really bad time.
---
Like honestly i would tell you to go try of sound mind as a corp but really i suspect your to sensitive for them.
---
Nah, gotta make it use negative CPU and powergrid
---
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
---
MAKEOVER!
---
I believe "we don't like" is different to "we don't", "posting" is different to "shitposting", isn't it?
---
&gt; The graph shows that something happened that threw the equilibrium price of isogen off
---
Yep, it was a deliberate change in mechanics. You want to mine mexallon, but the only way to get a new ore anomaly to spawn is to fully mine the current one, which means chomping up shitloads of isogen and pyerite that you don't really want/need. The entire idea of combining minerals in ores is a recipe for disaster, because you tank the prices of all the others trying to get the one that is in demand and profitable.
---
Pve has a ton of input compared to my exit cyno ( it presses one button all fleet ).
---
I've always wanted the 4 empires to be less well connected and for it to be dangerous to move between them. Also wanted their ship types to use special materials that can only really be found in their local space.
---
MAKE EVE BIG AGIAN.
---
This is why i don't do explo in stain even before the blackout. People aggressively and actively hunt explorers.
---
Osrs?
---
Probes have 2 turret hardpoints so that's not impossible. They can also deploy 3 drones at once as well.
---
the literal reason for the VNI change proves you wrong.
---
I have no idea, it was never implemented. When the Rorq changes were first announced CCP stated that they would be able to use "new fighter-sized mining drones". I believe that is what people are alluding to.
---
The transmission is getting an overhaul
---
There is another legit way... RMT...
---
If they catch your account doing RMT they will remove the ISK they traced down, which can lead to a negative wallet.
---
I'm used to blackout now. It's kind of hard to remember how it was before
---
Too right.
---
&gt; because it's safer and better in literally every way. 
---
So you do agree with me? That 1b cap surpasses any highsec income, even with that 1b battleship
---
&gt;you can also earn as much as a 1bn isk battleship in high sec with a 300m cruiser - doing the exact same content.
---
Please do tell me what magic cruiser can do as much as that 1bil battleship.
---
Obligatory HTFU meme &lt;enter here&gt;
---
No, but they sure whine hard when you talk about fixing their game-ruining advantages.
---
Also tell CCP to fix the last 4 fucking MERs where they 0'd out wh faucets.
---
Can't you sell to buy orders?
---
In all honesty the majority of the gamer base doesn't know much about the game. They are quick to want to nerf that which they do not understand.
---
[For Example if capitals are so OP, How do 3 Nightmares, two phantasms, and a couple of jump dessys take our three thannys in a C4?](https://zkillboard.com/related/31001663/201810130500/)
---
\- The people complaining about never killing capitals are the same folk who don't bother to learn about signature tanking or more advanced aspects of the game. They were always easy to kill...
---
\- This is not a fault with the game, but it's a two pronged problem. On one side CCP doesn't do much to explain the intricacies of sig tanking, let alone battleships.
---
\- The second problem, which I like to call the Hard Knocks Phenomenon. Is that once eve online players think they know how an outcome will go, they do not engage. Its the train of thought that says we can't undock because they'll kill us. People are scared of engaging capitals and they put them on the fucking pedestal.
---
Furthermore, I've gotten all these [Kills before any capital changes.](https://zkillboard.com/kill/73046814/)
---
I'm Pissed because I've just now, after fucking 13 years am getting into capitals. only to have them virtually rendered useless because nobody is good at this game and everyone would rather throw a fit than learn to get better.

Overly bureaucratic corporations probably run more normal people out of the game than the blackout ever could. Just dip out and find something better.

yeah to be honest, I felt I went a bit overboard with appealing to his authority. But I guess I was just trying to make a point.

matter of fact is, I don't like people being dicks and deminishing other people.

too tight.

Eh, I was mostly talking about the stunning aesthetics. X:R stations feel so alive!

Log in on an alt that doesn't have negative balance, sell plex, transfer isk?

It really isn't a big deal.

---
Some people just love to make a scene. You're both idiots.
---
&gt; That 1b cap surpasses any highsec income
---
no, because it doesn't. unless people were vastly understating carrier ratting income - it doesn't surpass high sec income at all.
---
&gt;Please do tell me what magic cruiser can do as much as that 1bil battleship.
---
i'll give you another post to think about it - if they are earning the same by doing the same activity - which activity can be done by both a battleship costing 1bn and a cruiser costing 300m with equal effectiveness?
---
VNI's have to press F once every 5 minutes or so. 
---
Exit cyno presses f1 like once after 3 hours, relatively 1 actions per 5 minutes is a lot higher then 1 action per 3 hours.
---
we don't care about capital targets, we want to fight subcaps. Capitals are boring.
---
personal contract history disappears after a while; which is ridiculous.
---
Thank for you logical and well thought out response. I will think about it.  I can appreciate this far more than "lawl git gud and adapt carebear". 
---
Balance is interesting to me because implies we know where the balance is, and as I am finding, everyone thinks it means different things vis a vi what is good for the game. But in the Sandbox, I wonder if that’s a product of mechanics, or the players. If, the players, were not so risk adverse, that we were having super-cap fights daily, that production/supply, couldn’t keep up with losses, would we even be having this conversation? In otherwords, is stagnation, umbrellas, too much ISK, and “super to the face” a function of balance and mechanics, or players unwilling to do accept risk and make content on a large scale?
---
For the record: Correct, I never thought Null was too safe. I damn near lost (as in within 1 second) a 9B rorqual to a Stukka fleet. I damn near lost a Nyx to a great dread bomb (in which other supers/titans did die). I've seen many many carriers, fax's, HAW dreads and like die due to a dedicated and competent enemy. I damn near lost a carrier in fleet combat because... well we just lost the engagement. Ratters in all flavors have been dying under the umbrella, pre and post blackout. So my personal anecdote is that no, Null has never been "too safe". I just required work, and yes, sometimes accepting that the super is going to get dropped on you when you’re ass deep in enemy territory.  But as indicated, with all things during these debates, its jut my personal annecdote.
---
Finally, if I accept things are out of balance, I would first address the methods thus far or getting things back into balance, Cyno and Blackout, as terrible ways to fix it. If Mechanic X causes massive proliferation, then why change Mechanic Y (which existed BEFORE mechanic X)? Wouldn’t it make more sense to systematically look at mechanic X, Y, and Z to determine how to achieve the desired balance effect? In other words, it’s not the changes per se, it’s the lack of thinking them through that I find distasteful.
---
looks like some one didn't know which way up the maulus went, and tried to make a video about it.
---
&gt; VNI's have to press F once every 5 minutes or so.
---
why would you ever press F in a VNI?
---
That’ll near-certainly be a Dreadnought btw~ There’s gonna be a new shipyard soon(tm) with all of those ships in the picture under construction

No I don't quit the game unlike most attention whores. I just leave and come back. This just means my phoenix is gonna stay docked indefinitely. Probably just fly nightmares for a while. Or just keep on krabbing on through the semester. Bruh. I literally just finished capital jump drive calibration IV. Glad I never injected it but smh.

I think you still need to pay taxes on it, even when selling to buy orders? I think that's what happened.

I disagree in part. I would agrue, that Rorqual and Citadel mechanics are principally at play here. If so, why not go back, as many have suggested, and fix THOSE mechanics. The rest are people organizing both in and out of game to create systems to optomize thier space--there is no nerf for "OP Teamwork".

If you look at the new Jita 4-4 station models showing the "renovations," you can see that they're using the same style of scaffolding to convey that construction is in progress.

You can find a preview image of that Triglavian asset on Hoboleaks, and the file is categorized as:

There are also numerous files that seem to show additional layers of scaffolding being added.

If Jita 4-4 blows up and all my assets are blown up/ejected into cans. CCP Just took away my cost sunk fallacy reason to keep playing. Please do :D
---
About time Jita 4-4 got a unique station tbh.
---
Have the Gallente upgraded to flying fortizars into Caldari stations now?
---
&gt; Also tell CCP to fix the last 4 fucking MERs where they 0'd out wh faucets.

I'll actually ask why they removed the faucets breakdown graph.
---
Also where did you get the WH losses data? It seems wrong.

Compared to a year ago the numbers are much lower

r/eve is dying! /s

I would agrue the Cyno changes do exactly that. Mechanics that directly effect saftey and security owned space. From Logistics, to Rorq saves, to Cap Escalations.

However, there are already a 1000 posts debating that topic, and since the changes arent live, its hard to assess whether the sky is falling or not.

The only way out of a negative wallet is a GM setting it to &gt;=0.00 ISK or transferring money from a different char that'll just get swallowed into the void until the negative balance is satisfied.
---
&gt; It's not that it's bad practice, it's just that there's no more (or very little) organic content.
---
I mean, is a semi-arranged fight so bad? Is the end result not the same, or even better? A fight is had, and your group didn't undock with the goal of anything but finding one. 
---
'Organic' content tends to be the ones that people bitch about the most, as that's when people undock something that tells you 'fuck off' like a hard-counter, caps/supers, or a fleet many times larger. Then instead of a fight, you either get to run away or get slaughtered.

&gt;no matter what the situation is. If somebody has an issue (wheter it's founded or not), invalidating how they feel is not a healthy behaviour.

You're one of those people that had to go to "cuddle therapy" after Trump got elected, aren't you? Cancel your account please.
---
It’s gonna turn into cloaky fleets hunting cloaky fleets tryna drop capitals on each other.
---
 But nobody will notice they’re even in the same system as each other. 
---
It’s actually gonna evolve into something boring. If they did it to any other class of non-cloaky ship. It’d be a lot better. Now everyone is gonna be a cloaky afk hunter. Main looks for shit it can kill easy (mining fleets and botters, the lowest form of content).
---
It’s not Yulai, it’s a new tower structure in the trig style - I’d be happy if something happened in yulai though lol

It’s crying that got the changes
---
If you think only eve could breed evil players you're just wrong. Wow breeds a truly different type of evil player: the player who is evil just because. This is because unlike in eve, in wow being evil gets you no benefit.
---
How ?
---
It would destroy roaming bomber fleets, it would destroy group activities.  The more organized would just organize solo play in a parallel manner...
---
It’s easy to claim the world is broken, but the fixes people are suggesting would not help
---
strategy and tactics vs execution
---
&gt;designed to never be in large engagements
---
Force recons were designed to never be in large engagements? Like, that's the role of the force recon... to never be in large engagements?
---
5 nestors do 7.5k dps? yeah sure buddy

---
if you find a non-seeded c6 RG pls pm me and i'll make sure to stuff a few caps in there
---
Step 1: Make a new acc.     
---
Step 2: swipe that card on the new acc.     
---
Step 3: Transfer the isk to your main.     
---
Step 4: ?????     
---
Profit!
---
It's always been this way. Eve has always had a lower execution skill cap than any action oriented mmo. This is a result of eve being mainly focused on strategy.
---
If you can manually pilot a ship under pressure and both activate and overheat modules the rest is just knowing when to do those things rather than the act of simply doing them.
---
&gt;steal my relic sites
---
I didn't see your name on them, nerd
---
Precisely. Ships should be used in similar manner as ammo. After losing one, you should reship and if possible join fight again. No point of crying after lost ones, and only things that you should be somehow cautious with, are strategic assets. And in Eve today, only Titans and whole Dread/Fax caches could be considered as such. Simply losing a dread or a carrier shouldn't be anything to sweat about.
---
TBH, I don't think most people that are risk averse are so just because of caps worth or about being unable to replace it. They simply don't want to get killed, and have that kill appear on their board on zkill.
---
Both then?
---
oh my sweet summer child. if only it was 5 million
---
Que all the people who haven't undocked in years heading out to fight them.
---
&gt; Hit me with your logic
---
&gt; Anyone who doesn't agree with me is dumb
---
Why even make this post?
---
Yep NC jf where moving today to jita like stupid
---
I think I just got a private text with an invitation to the corp. it's a high sec mining corp. they have a bunch of moons with a ore buyback system.
---
What is the strategy for tanking with those reps ?
---
all marauders can pretty comfortably tank upwards of 2k dps and the neuts with even less bling than a rattle. reason why no one does c5s in them is cuz their dps is garbage, and you are dead if someone rolls in while you're in bastion (which is all the time)
---
That little dino title card at the start is pretty dope
---
Let me guess the buyback is not jita price is it ?
---
luckily i don't live in a third world country and haven't been subjected to the ravings of that orange buffoon you call president.
---
That’s actually just a triglavian hair dryer. Made it into the logs by mistake. Never mind.
---
Our H296 (I believe that's the number) is 3 mill. A dread in and out with the mwd trick closes it. 3 dreads out without prop closes it for sure.
---
What's a baffon?

If walking in station project hasn't been axed recently, i'd say those look like prototype station interiors. v0v

And remarkably of the three different ways I did communicate with them, a GM responded first via Facebook.

Just because you don’t have the mental scope to understand Facebook isn’t just a marketing tool, doesn’t mean the companies that use it don’t
---
If you sell implants for isk, you better hope people lose their pods with implants often enough to buy more
---
\[LORE\]: in what station / which stations are the trials held where aspiring new pod pilots undergo the tests to determine fitness for the capsuleer life?
---
typo, I meant bufoon. thanks for pointing that out
---
Costs more than buying the skill book from an npc. Not that that's a bad thing though since they should be an isk sink.
---
You're being way too sensitive about this, OP.
---
emphasis on "stupid", judging from that killboard
---
Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do. I've looked into the history of the character  and what was going on, and it turns out I received isk as part of a corp giveaway. The guy doing it was buying it with real money so CCP took it away, that's the reply I was given from the support anyways, and it follows with what I've found by looking it up.
---
And then airing it out on Reddit to try to get other people to validate their feelings.
---
Lol
---
Turns out I received isk from a corp buddy some time ago that was bought with real money.
---
It's 3.3 my dude
---
I believe CCP Quant left as well. Quant wasn't an economist just someone who was interested in data analysis afaik
---
For me it screams FAX
---
yes! because we stop playing and start chilling here :-P :-D ;-)  win for reddit :-D
---
Only other caps do that according to the OP
---
organic fights are either not possible or not desirable in the age of supercap proliferation. to threaten anything of value and force people to undock, you need to use supercaps. but apparently no one wants to hit f1 every hour in a tidi-clusterfucked supercap brawl so there isn't desirable organic content in bloc vs bloc wars. supercapital mechanics literally make for more boring pvp compared to subcap fleets that at least involve constant repositioning.
---
Turns out I received isk from a corp buddy some time ago that was bought with real money. I didn't buy shit with real money tbh. I'd mine stuff and zone out to podcasts mostly so didn't event think about that.
---
That was gonna be my guess.
---
Yikes. Hard to get around that and you may not get it revoked.
---
Maybe time for a wallet alt :( to buy stuff for you
---
Server permanently fails to boot grid.
---
No chat and no deployables
---
Other than the cyno not showing on the overview how does this open more trade routes for jump freightering?
---
my desired playstyle is to undock, afk mine in peace for a couple hours while watching netflix, then go to bed. i'll occasionally drop a couple supers here and there, and gladly sit through a 10-hour tidi-clusterfuck every couple of years. its disgusting that ccp is nerfing this.
---
Can't sell due to taxes although that would help me real fast.
---
Hacs in general are picked over other options for a few reasons. Generally, they have better mobility than battleships and 
---
battlecruisers while having better/comparable damage projection. They also have better survivability due to smaller sigs, adc's, and again mobility, especially in the capital heavy meta of null right now. They are reasonably cheap and realativy low sp, giving them an advantage over faction battleahips and t3 cruisers (also no skill point loss). Munnins in partiular are the best mwd hac doctrine. The other viable options for mwd hac comps are Cerberus and Ishtars (most other hacs have major problems trying to fit guns, tank, and mwd) The main advantages munnins have over other mwd hacs are application and speed. Munnins are the fastest fleet hacs, and mobility plays a significant role in the survivability of any mwd fleep comp. In terms of damage, while cerbs and Ishtars both have great damage projection on paper, they have to deal with mitigating factors when put into action. Heavy missiles have application issues against unwebbed targets. They also do reduced dps when burning away from their target, which is a problem when your fleet comp is partially built around the ability to burn away. Ishtars dps is tied to drones (generally sentries), which similarly adds a cost to the mobility of the doctrine. Munnins, on the other hand, do not suffer from such draw backs. The have very good alpha, and can track cruisers and up pretty well at mid to long range even without web support. Their raw dps at long range is moderately lacking compared to other hacs, however the alpha makes up for it. Target transversal is also a concern, but it can be mitigated by good anchoring or by pulling range.
---
The up coming cyno changes will probably have relatively little effect on munnin fleets themselves, other than rapiers as support rather than huggins. The update may make munnins even more popular, as it is one of the best doctrines for volleying cruisers, something that is going to be a significant factor in dictating escalations in fights. Over the long term we may see the meta get a bit less restricted by heavy capital use, which might bring some larger hulls back into popularity, but I suspect that it will take some actual nerfs from ccp to reduce munnin usage.
---
tl;dr Hacs are low cost low sp ships with good tank and mobility. Munnins are very high mobility with decent projection, good application, and high alpha. Their high alpha may make them even more popular with the incoming cyno changes, as this will allow them to control escalation.
---
Cant log in with multi alpha though unless you wanna buy a couple laptops.
---
Tbf, if titans and supers were allowed in hs... imagine how many would be accidently concorded
---
Yes we all know the rules and some of us actually have that availability. Cough cough.
---
yeah please. there are like 20 large-medium sized pvp groups in wormhole space total. we literally can't traverse enough systems to kill krabs
---
Yeah, no contract history but I've got messages from the dreaded giveaway. Feeling salty for getting burned like that but whatever. Gonna make an alt and buy plex.
---
Those lights already exist on NPC stations.
---
It’s true I have seens it happens
---
&gt;game-ruining advantages
---
weird. last i checked we don't have supercap umbrellas in wormholes
---
&gt;Thats how weak people work, always someone elses fault  
---
Some are simply immune to logic
---
Examine your own biases.
---
My desired playstyle is to log in, cloak, and shoot defenseless ships inbetween afking for hours in enemy space. 
---
It’s amazing that ccp is buffing this
---
They didn't do that to have more isk in their accounts. Most of them did it to buy ships and shit. For many of them this has just become unprofitable. It's not so much avoiding the risk. It's just pointless to rat 2 hours, make 120m per day and lose a ratting ship worth 150m every other day. They don't stop because you frighten them. They stop because it's not sustainable.

Rancer-style camping replaces it
---
&gt;and highsec courier logistics jump to mind.
---
Lot more interesting if the couriers need to be good enough or smart enough pilots to get through lowsec.
---
Then why do you cream your panties over bubbling my rorqs?
---
Should note that before i quit, i had 6 sub cap pvp pilots for 6 different regions. Thats the opportunity cost, by making me not want to play with my 12 pve toons, new eden has also lost 6 pvp pilots. Some were f1 monkeys, some were small gang, some were hunters. Just whatever i felt like. And sometimes I felt like pve. Sometimes i felt like doing logistics or turbo crabbing. 
---
There's a reason i crabbed in so many caps, i could fuel my poor pvp skills and welp sub caps without caring. I also made thousands of sub caps in various regions below market for fleets to take out amd welp, thus making sub caps cheaper for hundreds of sub cap pilots. 
---
When you drive crab pilots away, you also drive pvp pilots away.
---
sorry you're afk while ratting so you get caught by cloaky ships that take 5+ seconds to lock anything.
---
ccp needs to really nerf the shit out of cloaking modules
---
They always denied they were
---
Who knew that actually playing the game was a thing?
---
What implants do you use on that simulated rorqual? Without it doesn't fit and it doesn't get all the same stats.
---
So you are saying you just have to anchor a Keepstar, then blow it up on the anchoring timer. That seems awfully cheap for a permanent wh connection, not to mention that you can suddenly deploy everywhere from everywhere and if you can defend them, logistics routes to trade hubs would be no longer an issue.
---
there are 20-ish
---
Spending money on bonus laptops to not spend money on subs is ridiculous. Cough
---
I mean, my 1 bil pacifier is a nice km ~~if~~ when I fuck up.

I typically don't empty my cargo till it's full or I dock
---
"Thinking about the Angels capitals"........... "furiously balls fists"
---
You just don't get it. Plus people could already have the laptops. No one said you had to. Smh let people play the game how they want to play it. If you're upset because someone else has this ability then keep it to yourself.
---
120k EHP from a hobo t2 fit Falcon? I think we need to redefine "paper tank" man.
---
It's determined by the cloak itself (it's a stat) and what level of `Cloaking` you have trained.
---
&gt;  it's more of a not having a proactive thought process 
---
Well, most veteran players are scared shitless of undocking and doing something solo, because they know that what happened to you, will happen to them. Most of us have been there, done that, both sides.
---
Just keep doing what you are doing, have fun and don't worry about it.

---
Dude you're arguing with eve online's Ben Shapiro. This guy is clearly a moron.
---
I've seen Drifters in Highsec since the raids began, but I haven't seen them attack. Considering they use the Autoscythians as scouts, a Drifter siege on Jita 4-4 wouldn't be outside the realm of possibility. Don't they like collecting Capsuleer biomass? That station probably has the highest concentration of it out of anywhere in Highsec. It would be the perfect place to attack.
---
Of course, if they're playing the long game and have a keen eye for our economics, they wouldn't though. While they could grab a whole lot of biomass all in one go by assaulting Jita, they would probably cripple the Capsuleer economy for months to years by doing so. Bad economy means fewer people venturing out into Nullsec where they can be continually harvested.
---
Easily the best reply here, fights in eve are 90% intelligence and 10% execution. Sometimes the 10% makes the difference but most days it doesn't.
---
Also to the same dude all three times... lul
---
Yeah I linked the pic in my original comment but it redirected to immediately download the file so I deleted it to not scare anyone lol

Add a ➕ sign to the front
---
The "hardcore" playerbase left a long time ago
---
It signifies the docking radius, nothing to do with tethering
---
For a line member a semi arranged fight is good, it keeps them going.
---
For the FC, even if you win, arranged combat can be exhausting. It's just not the same as winning a spontaneous fight where neither party has all the intell.
---
That being said, a brawl challenge in J-Space has got to be some of my favorite fights. But in that case it is more about winning a really tough game of chess where the board might disintegrate at any moment than winning in a normally pre-arranged fight.
---
To top that off, wormhole challenges are more often given by the formed fleet to the potential victims than by the guys who are forming in response.
---
Cloak module delay + cloaking skill bonus + hull bonus.
---
So without a hull effect like bombers, a regular cov-op cloaking device II is 10sec -50% with cloaking V.
---
It’s 3m mass. You can jump three dreads out or two out one back etc
---
Oh right yea, I think i just pulled a single region by mistake now that I think about it heh, good eye.
---
You mean you can't just watch netflix and lazily rat to support yourself now, whatever will you do?!?!?! /s
---
Holy shit I never knew that's what that did.  So I didn't have to go 40 jumps to get a skillbook I could have just paid a little extra
---
Hey he undocked. Gotta give him that
---
what would nc know though right ? :)
---
Also remember that non-covert cloaks nerf scan resolution, so be careful with your instalocking setups.
---
I kinda hope Frontier makes it happen in Elite soon. Maybe that or Star Citizen turns out to not be vaporware after all. Either or both would probably give CCP a nudge to try doing it again.
---
But that reminds me: Lore-wise, Capsuleers aren't locked inside their capsules, right? They just can't have their latest memories transferred to a new clone if they're not in their capsule when they die?

on some random cloaky (coverops cloak) logi-loki fitt i have saved in pyfa i get 6s whit cloaking lvl4 and 5s whit cloaking lvl5
---
No, you have closeable, instanced space, with player-caps, and an invincible hub station with teleport gates to all parts of the universe, and your teleport is almost nu-predictable and, and is impossible to counter the first-strike.  
---
But yess, please continue to whine that some pvpers stopped your free afk vni killing.  See you at 20,000 pcu.
---
Also thanks for proving my point.
---
Yes comrade such capitalistic display of wealth is not welcomed in North Korea.
---
A perfect example of someone being salty after losing an argument on the internet is shown in the comment above. Enjoy.
---
Of C6 only or C5 and C6?
---
No you wait and burn it on the legendary drop
---
because bubbling your rorq makes you people undock/login and actually fight. Otherwise you stay docked shit talking from tether. We don't actually want to kill the rorq, we just want people to actually show up to fight. If no one brings anything, then we'll escalate to kill the rorq, but its not our #1 goal.
---
Also, don't confuse every small gang to be the same that froths at the mouth to kill capitals. A good portion just want subcap fights, but almost all of us will engage a capital if it means we get people to actually undock and fight instead of hiding in their fort because we interrupted their ratting time.
---
This is why you don’t align after cynoing in, and just dock.

And despite the orange buffoon we're saddled with at the moment, our economy is still the largest in the world, almost twice the GDP of China in second place.
---
Our coast guard *alone* would make the 12th largest navy in the world, if it were a branch of the military.
---
Our air force is 300% larger than the second closest in the world. ~3900 vs ~13,000 and with the exception of a very low number of more advanced than average planes Russia and China have, we've outstripped the rest of the world in terms of R&amp;D by orders of magnitude. With few exceptions, most of the rest of the world is flying around in model T's compared to the US, Russia or China. We have squadrons of fighters that are 1000% larger than most 3rd world countries entire air force combined. If they can even afford a single fighter.
---
Supplying just fuel for *one* branch of our military for a year could bankrupt many countries around the world.
---
So yeah, our president is shit. But us being a 3rd would country? Nah. We could afford to buy and sell whatever country you're from twice over and still have fuck you money.
---
Ah yes, social justice warrior speak.

Found another one for Pantsufan
---
Guess what. If you have enough time to get 1 dread in, you have enough time to get 100 dreads in, if your fleet mates actually can manage to push the right thing at the right time. If you only get in 2 of those 100 its cause your fleetmates suck and thats your punishment.
---
Adrenaline will do that to a brain! It's probably why Eve can be so addictive at times.
---
One simple solution to your problem is to train some reflexes, make them habits and soon you'll even forget that you're doing it. You learn those reflexes by running around in a cheap-fit T1 frigate, engaging everything and dying a lot. Happy hunting!
---
Use d-scan, learn to locate ships accurately, spend some time in a system/constellation, check Zkill for the general area. Use the information to move around and choose your fights wisely.

Not everyone is a fucking bot, mate. Even if you click dscan every 2 seconds or whatever the cycle time of that is there is a high chance you never see anything coming until it decloaks next to you. If you are a roamer you know this. It has nothing to do with afk'ing. There is just no defense except using a pvp-fit for ratting and survive maybe 20% of the attacks, while also gimping the income. You can't be so dense to not understand that.
---
I think this is where Eve is not typical. sometimes getting away means you won. once you learn that that game is way more fun.
---
There was an argument?  Someone lost something? I just made a statement about the video game and you got super shitty. Not a whole lot to see.

---
At first glance, what you said might appear true, but the problem is that CCP wants the game to be played a certain way and isn't shy about enforcing their ideas of how the sandbox should be used. It's a sandbox where you can play however you want...as long as you want to play the CCP-approved way. If you don't play CCP's way, well...they've designed the game to ensure that you won't have a pleasant experience.
---
When players found a way to carve out corners of the sandbox where they could actually play the way they want, CCP came and kicked over their sandcastles, then ~~salted the earth~~ changed the rules to ensure that players would never again be able to use that corner of the sandbox "incorrectly". Sadly, this is nothing new (aside from the scale); this game has plenty of silly "features" that exist solely to cement the supremacy of the CCP-approved playstyle: ganks, ganks, and more ganks, with a side of ganks. 
---
You'd think they'd have just made a movie, instead of an online game, if they wanted to dictate all of the characters' actions.

DS9 had a permanent hole and nerds loved that.
---
Please explain why killing an onlined keep and having the anchored hole exist is bad.
---
they probably will change those mechanics at some point as well. 
---
nothing is stopping teamwork and organisation, id say they are actually going be them all the more important after all the changes. all the things you list will still be there and possible, they will just require more effort. less automation when it comes to intel gathering as a result of the fact that gathering reliable intel requires you to get eyes on ships now instead of scraping and less ubiquitous escalation to supers because of its relative ease.
---
Im the same way. Never given a single fuck about killmails or pods. also hate achievements being put into every single game on earth.
---
I'm meaning becoming criminal via ganking.
---
i mean you can't smartbomb rat in c5 rgs so i only counted c6
---
Considering the volume of traffic and amount of players; it should be 10x the size of a keepstar.
---
because all of them required actual social interaction to work. you know, the very core of an mmo. in retail nothing except mythic raids forces you to communicate with another player in the slightest. Imagine eve where you never had to talk to another player to win, thats retail wow.
---
Viva la Gallente Repulic!

Was the years of crying before these changes equally as pathetic, or was that just "constructive feedback" since you agree with them?
---
The discord invite link in the op doesnt work.
---
no one in wormhole space cares about killing vnis. most of the time we hold vnis hostage and see if yall care enough to form a fleet to defend your ratters. most of the time thats either a no or 20 supercaps. if you afk rat then you deserve to die.
---
you also seem to not understand how wormholes work. no one lives in thera. we can't teleport places.
---
My perspective: 
---
 I sit a little more on the empire building side, I’ve enjoyed blackout though, it’s brought a good feel back to null. But for me it feels like null is turning more into a pvp arena where you go to fight, and the ability to build a home in null is not as worth it. You can now safely make much more isk in hi sec. Why live in null (the hours it takes to try and set up a home is ridiculous) if it is just a pvp arena?
---
Gosh you really don't get it, people don't blap cynos now because they are at least 200k ehp brick tanks. And if at least one cap makes it they have a hard cyno to bring everyone else is.
---
When the cyno is a 90k ehp recon there is no reason not to insta blap it.
---
Thank you! The tip about engagement profile definitely helps!
---
That's a good strawman that totally replies to what I've said. Imagine writing that much for a argument that's not there.

What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.

---
Glad he kicked you out, you probably would’ve caused more problems.

I think what you’re saying is that it’s not worth building a home if you have to sustain any risk at all. Hard to agree with that.

---
You are attempting to equate millions of man hours of work with dozens of man hours exploiting an edge case.
---
Also, you're attempting to justify the "fix" of that millions of man hours being of equal value to 5 drunk guys in an NPC station saying "let's go roam!!" one night.
---
This would be the gigantic problem with these changes:  CCP's rewarding the lazy and unprepared.
---
The only 'difficult part is that you need to iterate the state a few passes with the ones I use, since I didn't want to try to derive a true function.
---
One of the driving values is the 'catch up distance', or the distance gap that happens during the MWD off cycle:
---
    CatchUpDistance = ChaseMaxDistance + ChaseDelay(1.0s) * (TargetSpeed - DroneOrbitSpeed) - FlyRange
---
Then you have to find how many MWD cycles it will take to 'catch up'.  This is the part where you have to self-iterate to keep it 'simple'.  
---
    MWDcycles = 1 + ( [ TrueCatchUpDistance / (DroneMWDSpeed - TargetSpeed) ] - ChaseDur(2.5s) ) / ChaseDur(2.5)  
---
    TrueCatchUpDistance = CatchUpDistance + INT(MWDcycles) * (DroneMWDSpeed - TargetSpeed)  
---
Then from there you can derive the states of the drone by calculating how much time it spends in each state.  
---
    OrbitTime = ChaseDelay(1.0s) + (ChaseMaxDistance + FlyRange) / (TargetSpeed - DroneVelocity)  
---
    MWDorbitTime = [ RoundUp(MWDcycles) * ChaseDuration(2.5s) + Int(MWDcycles) * ChaseDelay(1.0s) ] - CatchUpTime  
---
    CatchUpTime = Max(0 , MWDcycles * ChaseDuration(2.5s) + Int(MWDcycles-1) * ChaseDelay(1.0s)  
---
Add those up, find % time in each state, apply the tracking values from those states, average according to ratio.
---
&gt;nothing is stopping teamwork and organisation,
---
Except for the direct nerfs to them.
---
There's an awful lot of players here with delusions of grandeur.
---
There's shitposting and then there's stainguy shitposting. 
---
I hear WOW Classic is coming soon.
---
I love the change. No more win button cap drops on cruiser and frig gangs. Could not be happier. Evens the playing field.
---
Just in time to become irrelevant due to tax changes and citadels
---
Holy shit how fucking risk averse are you guys that you're cargo scanning before engaging.
---
Capital brawls don't exist
---
Just make an alt and do a few career agent hub missions. Not to hard to make that back in a few days. If you don't mind fitting a t1 explorer frig and taking a few risks you can make that in a day or 2 doing wormhole sites.
---
Feelings are useless and over rated. Get over them and you'll go alot further in life and eve.
---
I dunno about anyone else, but what I most enjoyed about having a home in null was having to actually go and defend it. The fights I had and the wars I participated in were what made null in any way meaningful. This concept of "empire building" sounds really good while you're doing it, but eventually you have your empire and nothing to do with it.        
---
Everything has to build to something. There's no point in building a giant nullsec sandcastle just for the sake of having a giant nullsec sandcastle.
---
We're not lol
---
When over 10% of isk dies in wh small gang without a single super and very few capitals, we kill a *lot* of shit. 
---
Hell, NJED has maybe thirty actual humans who play and we still consistently blow up more than 15b every month *in wh space alone*. 
---
Never not take a fight.
---
I appreciate your voice of clarity.
---
IMO people that bitch that they cant find shit need to look better and people that complain about less safety need to organize more. Having fun is easy as long as your not lazy.
---
So, because people who don't want to talk got their easymode they can run without talking, the game is bad despite the good old versions that require communications still existing?
---
Remember when they sold those sabre skins for the eu portion of the day then sold out ustz? Man CCP is big retard
---
Yup seeing it more and more everyday
---
Eve is war, regardless of security status
---
Wait, really? So if they start a lock on you AFTER you press the cloak button you're still not safe?
---
Because in the situation I was, if I didn't MWD + Cloak I would've been de-cloaked. In a sabre bubble with some frigs running around and I was in a nano Astero.
---
Guess Bob was with me on that day
---
I guess it makes wormhole space dangerous, can’t have that.
---
How is that different from literally any other jump.
---
For me it was the end goal of eve. A sandbox world where you go into null and everything is run by players, borders moving, teaming up with your friends to claim your space. 
---
I lived in lowsec for long time when I first started, but it always had the pirate that patrols a particular section of space feel. Not a bad thing, but very different to making your own home
---
Just lol. Using station and be OS like a noob.
---
Great idea. There are so many items with no description of what it does which seems awful for new players to have to go into attributes and try to gleam the relevant info.
---
Instead of bitching that the proposed system is bad... 
---
# Go propose a better system that achieves the same* goals.
---
^(\*or better)
---
If you have multiple routers for coverage it may be the different routers trying to give you a new ip adress, changing it so only one router assigns these instead of all of them could be the problem as i had a similar problem.
---
He was right to kick you. You're being an asshole.
---
&gt;Like the reason a lot of people are advocating for more content for smaller groups if i can't field a 100 in fleet right now well i might as well not bother going anywhere
---
Hi.  I've been involved in killing people trying to roam in Eso.
---
The problem was not that there's no way for a "small gang" to get any kills.  The problem was small gangs that weren't flown all that well or decided "our 5 frigates can totally kill that carrier!!!".
---
For example, sutonia comes by solo and attacks my hulks.  My rorq repairs them, and he leaves when the dps drones come out.  He then goes on to kill a few VNIs during that trip.
---
OTOH, I had two frigates tackle my ratting Ishtar and I killed one of them and its pod....with only me being tackled.
---
As for this:
---
&gt;so that people that are on the winning team don't sprint forward to hard it allows smaller groups to give there line members some fun so they can grow over time
---
you are extremely wrong.  No local and cyno changes hurts us big blocs.....But we've got plenty of people to  park some faxes and blops next to every cluster of rorquals if we need to.
---
Smaller groups?  You don't.  Which means no "catching up".
---
True enough, but at the same time if the only way to have fun is to spend 20+ hours a week doing the boring stuff just so you can do the fun stuff. Then maybe there are some things that could be changed? Regardless which side you are on
---
There are two competing theories you mention above are being tested in Null now and one will win in the end either some or all of the empires will shrink/collapse or alternatively some will grow stronger and in the end succeed in dealing with the insecurity and uncertainty. To borrow from Nietzsche what does not kill me makes me stronger. I for one will be interested in seeing how it plays out, interesting times for null.
---
if "the easymode" is 99% the game, its not an mmo anymore. Imagine if in eve the only thing that required you to talk to another player was supercap brawls, would you still try and use that logic to defend the lack of communication?
---
It depends on the ship. A covert ops ship can start locking inmediately after pressing the decloack button.
---
⬆️ RMT
---
The only thing in eve you can't do without communication is fleet fights and even the listening is enough.
---
So 99% of the game is pretty much stuff you can do without ever talking.
---
OP admitted he screwed up. You'll have a cloaking device (as long as you aren't alpha), he even saw them on dscan and knew they were there. In that situation, you can warp to a safe and cloak and your 100% safe. Or just leave and take your millions in booty home.     
---
Most of the time we get blown up we know we're doing something risky. And that's fine. It's what makes things exciting and how you learn. Just always follow that doctrine, don't fly what you can't replace.    
---
My t2 fit heron costs like, 5mil (4 of which is the cloak II and 2x nano II's). You can literally loot that from one can in a wh site. Sometimes you'll come across 30jmil cans at relics.     
---
On the other side you can fit a t1 PvP frig and go into low/null/wormholes and pop those 80 million asteros' easily if you catch them off guard uncloaked. With a &lt;5mil ship and fit. Web, scream, some tank, speed, few drones maybe. Every race has at least one t1 frig that is extremely annoying in pvp vs far more expensive targets.     
---
Make a friend and have one of you fly an ewar frig and the other in a DPS one and you can actually take down ships/fits in the billions in little &lt;5m frigate fits. Lose and die? You can die a hundred times and still not lose as much a careless person losing one fancy ship.
---
I could care less about the black out, but this cyno change is crap, now all the capitals are just giant paperweights no one will use cause it’s too much trouble. End of large scare capital fights, have to watch them on YouTube
---
The main purpose of null (and wh) is that it is player controlled.
---
&gt;You are attempting to equate millions of man hours of work with dozens of man hours exploiting an edge case.
---
I guess? For the health of the game, there exist some things that you shouldn't be able to do, no matter how much effort you put in. The AHARM analogy felt obvious to me, but we can set that aside. There is some measure of safety in nullsec that CCP thinks is too much regardless of effort. I don't know what it is. It's probably not the same measure you'd use, or I'd use, but I bet from all the "chaos era" talk that we passed it.
---
&gt;Also, you're attempting to justify the "fix" of that millions of man hours being of equal value to 5 drunk guys in an NPC station saying "let's go roam!!" one night.  
---
&gt;This would be the gigantic problem with these changes: CCP's rewarding the lazy and unprepared.
---
yes. new certificate has been issued by the Nigerian Prince. All funds should go directly to him
---
Not at all, risk is fine. That’s part of living in null. If there was the ability to own space in hisec it would be boring. I’m saying part of building any empire in real world history is being bale to reduces those risks as much as possible. 
---
Here is an imaginary situation that might help explain what i mean. If humans went and made a settlement in a jungle surrounded by tigers the first thing they would do would be set up defenses and try not to die. There would still be risk, but as long as there was something worth having in the jungle they would stay. But if they weren’t allowed to defend themselves in anyway no one would live there. People might made trips into the jungle for resources, but it wouldn’t be worth living there.
---
can fit a censer med cap battery with a t2 MAPC  that should let you fit at least one damage mod.  
---
also might be able to do a 2x small battery fit that lets you get 1-2 damage mods, need to do the cap recharge math, also might help to roll a few cap batteries with mutaplasmids for extra neut resists/cap, last I looked small cap battery mutas were pretty cheap.
---
&gt;Force people to move and/or leave their safety and fewer will do so
---
No, they'll just move their safety with them.
---
It's not like it's hard for the blocs to put up more keepstars and move the home defense supers.
---
As an added bonus, the blocs now take up a lot more space, and we can finally get rid of the idea that a small group could venture out into null.
---
So, are you leading a corp right now and trying to build an empire up?
---
There is another issue with computers coming up in mid ~2030s. Basically we decided it would be a great idea to start a count in seconds from 1970s and that number continues to grow. It will exceed the maximum integer value for 64bit sometime in 2030. As a software engineer it will be interesting to see how this one pans out.
---
1) They just made logistics far, far easier 
---
2) They made rorq saves? Take another ship if you want to dogpile in
---
3) This is an excuse of a joke, you've heard everyone say they'll swap to recons for cyno-ing in.
---
Only if the text below the logo didn't look like something from 2005... :/
---
Kinda subtracted a bit from the good animation.
---
Bruv we got rolled so hard we're in highsec now.
---
Would it be possible to get a option of an exponential x-axis on warp time? The linear one only feels useful for longer warp distances.
---
What’s the point of wars in null if isn’t worth having something to fight for in the first place?
---
Should we all make isk in hi sec, then once a month get in our ships and fight to the death in null for no reason. Then next month rinse and repeat?
---
Loss of extremley short term memory may be a sign of a stroke or tumour, you should  see your doctor.
---
i agree
---
Strangely enough, the guided bombs can miss if a ship is small and fast. When that happens, the bomb starts to orbit because it doesn't have the ability to slow down to reduce orbit distance, and thus just kinda hangs out.
---
I agree with this. But what happens when there is no reason to control it anymore? What does it turn into then?
---
So you made a reddit post about taking sov no one wants?
---
Yes, I would agree it is better but your “test” was bias with past knowledge of the game. There are still many new players that literally can’t even figure out what to train let alone finding out every little in and out that exists for bonus SP.
---
Shit idea, no local is great.
---
TBH I don't have enough experience with the scene to know if a drop or a WF title would be worth more. But burning an alt on a wipe would be kinda iffy since it doesn't guarantee your group still succeeding.
---
I subconsciously read this in Chance's voice...
---
Not so sure about the cyno, but excited to find out. Beacons, and camping them, just got a substantial boost.
---
I thought about that but ended up not doing it because
---
1) It's needed only on warp graph and only on its leftmost part
---
2) My expectation was that normal use-case for warp time graph is people figuring out how long does it take to travel normal-ish distance, i.e. 20-30 AU
---
3) As a workaround for short distances you can set distance range to desired low values (i did some theorycrafting a while back with short on-grid warps and it was alright)
---
4) Logarithmic scales often confuse casual users because they are too used to linear scales
---
If there're more graph types which would benefit from it - sure I can add it. But for now I do not see need to put effort into this part.
---
Type in local.
---
&gt; Huh?
---
- Bloc spends millions of man hours building up their space so it's secure.
---
- 5 guys in an NPC station say "let's go roam!"
---
Before changes: 5 guys die horribly, 'cause they were lazy and unprepared.  They didn't know what they were getting into, they didn't try to figure out who, where or when to go after.  They didn't bother figuring out what they could do safely, 'cause they're drunk, and rammed straight into a defense fleet with a shitty kitchen-sink-ish fleet.
---
After changes: 5 guys get some Myrm kills, head home, talk about how awesome they are at Eve and everyone else sucks 'cause they're elite.  Ignoring that the only reason they survived is no local cloaked them, and cyno changes limited response to them.
---
That's a problem.  It's rewarding the people who made the least effort.
---
They're all empty though...
---
I wanna suicide gank Martin Shkreli for a freighter full of shit he RMT'd for
---
crap
---
Use them in a way that keeps your armor and hull hp above 0.
---
You're about 2 months and a few injectors away from end game super ratting
---
Badly-executed RMT?
---
https://br.evetools.org/related/30004878/201908211400
---
Good video. I liked your editing. 
---
That said, the "We won the timer" Feels a bit like propaganda with having nearly 50% more losses while fighting on your forts. And lumping in NC and Panfam, when they only had a handful of ships present.
---
Edit: There should be a war. I miss the blatant, in your face wartime propaganda.
---
It's not just about them being able to take more space. But a super umrella can only reach so far. It's pretty stupid that an alliance the size of goons can consolidate under 1 super umbrella. And they are not even close to capped. More then half their systems are unused. An alliance that size should need at least 4 regions for their pve needs. Right now all of eves nullsec alliances could probably fit in 3-4 regions.
---
wow that just proves you are real bad at the game. are you new? try having literally any wh corp without talking to or having any corpmates, cant be done. try having an impact in FW without grouping with other players at some point, cannot be done. try holding any nullsec space without having friends, cannot be done. even having an industry corp that you run entirely solo puts you significantly behind groups that help eachother.
---
You don't think people would just move somewhere else for the trade market?
---
&gt;Upcoming cyno changes: great if you want to roam into null for fights without getting dropped as much.
---
That's where you're wrong, kiddo
---
I'm so dumb. I didn't entirely too long trying to open the links (on mobile). Poor dude though, what exactly was he attempting?
---
Null should be high risk high reward. Empires will be built and empires will crumble. If you can’t defend your space there are areas concord will help. It is not becoming a PvP arena, it always was a PvP arena. It just became safer and safer as the game has aged thanks in part due to the success of the larger empires and the smaller ones bending the knee. This resulted in people who don’t want to fight moving there as the isk was better then high sec. These people should not be earning the rewards with little risk. 
---
The rorqual changes were due to economics. The value of isk has been diminishing rapidly these last few years and without intervention the game would have had multiple issues arise (some of which were already evident). CCP are finally fixing the game and although many are complaining in time it will just be the new norm and nullsec will be a place worth fighting for.
---
Lmao kys
---
yeah.  So, the process for verifying certs for Lets Encrypt has huge visibility, follows an RFC like process and they're pretty darn good about fixing things as they find them. They also have mandatory CT support so you can verify the state of your domains etc.    
---
An internal CA will barely have an understood process for verifying things that need signing, will probably be ADCS based and have broken (misconfigured) support for OCSP/CRLs etc and has very little chance of having something like CT.  Don't even get me started on the average storage gaffs for an internal CA etc.  
---
You may be able to occasionaly get a cert through letsencrypt that you shouldn't -- but in theory you can use the same/similar process with another (currently unregistered) public CA and issue a similar certificate.  
---
Like you can  attack BGP and become the mail handler for a domain and register certs on behalf of other folks.  Find an arbitrary file include on an already operating webserver in a domain you want and you can register a new certificate. DNS takeover and register the appropriate text record, subdomain takeover and register specifically for that sub domain etc.  
---
None of those vectors apply specifically to LetsEncrypt.
---
It's safe space for the autistic. Where the facade is contrived as to appear to be a violent, scary place.. when in reality the space is negotiated, battles and wars are put together in TS3/Mumble/Discord channels by the very few. Your space is given up when one person accepts ISK from another person, and you see none of it but are forced to move your assets to the other side of New Eden.
---
Where 99% are nothing but useful fodder in a chess game between half a dozen total-assholes who don't, and never will give a flying fuck about any of you. And you take it, dry, up the ass willingly with a smile.
---
Let's not forget how Alex got where he is. He fucked over an entire alliance (with more help than he has ever admitted).
---
Now is the time for a dozen betrayals to happen. Become famous... from there you can decide if you want to spend the next 10 years as a schlep who was handed everything by CCP via corruption, or you can forge the future of Eve.
---
It super tight. Ive hit 4 cycles when I focus hard on min maxing
---
No it doesn't
---
Webs for the cruisers and scrams on the drifter. Makes a huge difference in damage application
---
LoL
---
It allows you to get out of site even with frigs pointing you. Not sure how i never died. I got caught once, but it was through a frig hole, and it was wingspannt, so I just fragged all of their bombers lol
---
    So I was not kidding when I say we flew damn near around the whole galaxy. Here is a map of our journey: https://i.imgur.com/tcWyrSK.png
---
Has any major miner/industry character (or corporation as a whole) quit doing what they are doing or quit the game and caused a significant impact on the market or Eve as a whole?
---
Someone has to do the mundane crap, but what if they stop?
---
&gt;But a super umrella can only reach so far.
---
A super umbrella can move.
---
&gt;It's pretty stupid that an alliance the size of goons can consolidate under 1 super umbrella.
---
Good news!  Their umbrella is large enough they could split it in 3rds/4ths and cover 3/4 regions with 3/4 standing fleets.
---
But that brings the problem that Goons now occupy three or four regions instead of one.
---
&gt;Right now all of eves nullsec alliances could probably fit in 3-4 regions.
---
And my point is *that's a good thing.*
---
You need the blocs to be dense so that there's space for other people to get into null.  Otherwise you're left with just the blocs in null because there's no room for anyone else.
---
Look at the land rush going on in places like Vale and Tribute.  That's what we want to be happening if you want a vibrant game.  More people in null so there's more friction and thus more wars.
---
I don't even use the cap boosters. Its just for bad days. You only need to pulse the booster when drifter is on field. Ive never seen anybody else doing this. Wouldnt surprise me if somebody else was doing it
---
&gt; You don't know what a sandbox game means. A sandbox doesn't mean a  completely unmaintained game relying on random mechanics which do not  depend on balanced principles. You can't just throw in the word sandbox  and expect it to be a counter-argument to against proposal for game  balance. 
---
I agree that if I thought that a sandbox was "a completely unmaintained game relying on random mechanics which do not depend on balanced principles", I wouldn't know what a sandbox was. Fortunately for me, though, that is not the case!
---
Believe it or not, there is plenty of room between "completely unmaintained" and "defining player goals for them". Dictating that players must use nullsec for your and CCP's idea of "high risk, high reward", which apparently means relatively high isk/hour coupled with frequent and virtually unavoidable deaths to gankers, constitutes the latter, not the former.
---
&gt;Rise himself said if the risk is too high then they will consider upping  the rewards. That's how you maintain a risk/reward balance. Umbrella  nullsec being safer than hisec was -the- unacceptable status quo of  risk/reward. 
---
Come on....did you even TRY to figure this out on your own, like I tried to help you do?
---
Do you ACTUALLY think that people are just going to sit there happily being farmed to death, and paying $15 a month for the privilege, while patiently waiting for some...individuals of questionable intelligence to eventually decide to that they deserve a few extra space-pixels as compensation for the constant indignity and frustration of being forced into the role of a human pinata?
---
If nullsec pve becomes unprofitable, or just not profitable enough to justify the frustration and lossmails associated with your idea of "risk", people will move on - either to other areas of EVE, or away from EVE entirely.  So then you get a period of nullsec being dead, while the would-be killmail farmers cry and demand that CCP do something about the fact that the former pvers who are docked up, logged off, and unsubbed are "too safe" and that gankers should be able to "interact" with them.
---
Eventually, one of the...."geniuses" at CCP finally realizes that no matter what stupid changes they make to game mechanics, they can't force the pvers to feed kills when there aren't any pvers left. So, they "consider upping the rewards" and hope that they have enough players left who are willing to take on the role of killmail-dispensers. Even in the best case scenario, they've lost a (probably large) number of players at this point - both pvers who got tired of being treated like shit by both the devs and the community, and would-be killmail farmers who went too long without any free kills.
---
So try any actual endgame and you need to communicate.
---
Sounds familiar
---
Lol no it won't. 5 nestors do maybe 3500 dps with perfect skills. That's less than half the isk/hour
---
well if what we are planning on doing is anything to go by, gonna have a lot less small groups of rorqs and just shitloads in a few places to make having cynos ready easier
---
Ah thanks for the info I was told there were a lot less
---
Genoa, 5% PG and a faction mindlink
---
Fort sympathique !
---
I miss the days when ransoming was a thing. Now nobody cares if they lose their pod, given the clone changes. Sometimes you could even ransom a blingy ship, but most people fly "already replaced," ships and really just roll over and die if caught.
---
Only bombers get that. Other covops do not.
---
Understandable
---
&gt;yeah. So, the process for verifying certs for Lets Encrypt has huge visibility, follows an RFC like process and they're pretty darn good about fixing things as they find them. They also have mandatory CT support so you can verify the state of your domains etc.
---
I literally made a typo and got a cert.  So, no, there actually is a problem.
---
&gt;but in theory you can use the same/similar process with another (currently unregistered) public CA and issue a similar certificate.
---
The expensive folks like Verisign require additional documentation before issuing their first cert to you.  My typo would have not gone through.
---
This is what some parts of eve null sec was for some period, in what some people herald as 'the golden era'.  A high sec, level 4 mission farming alt was considered standard affair, since it was neutral and essentially unassailable other than ganks.
---
All it took were some blue crabs and a bit of elbow grease. Once goons find a new set of neckbeards to implant into the region, we'll be back. God Bless Darwinism and God Bless Texas
---
Thanks, and likewise. :-)
---
I would say balance is a product [both of mechanics and players](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_design). Player risk aversion is definitely a thing, and CCP has traditionally tried to contest this by making riskier activities generally more lucrative. At least for PVE. They're in an awkward spot with regards to PVP because they want to make victories meaningful (losses particularly for the losing side) and at the same time encourage people to commit when they aren't sure they're going to win.
---
Sidenote: Citadels do one thing brilliantly well, which is allow *both* sides in an engagement to claim victory. One can win the isk war, and the other the timer.
---
&gt;Cyno and Blackout, as terrible ways to fix it. If Mechanic X causes massive proliferation, then why change Mechanic Y (which existed BEFORE mechanic X)? Wouldn’t it make more sense to systematically look at mechanic X, Y, and Z to determine how to achieve the desired balance effect? In other words, it’s not the changes per se, it’s the lack of thinking them through that I find distasteful.
---
I'm actually a fan of rapid iterations in development, so that may be in part why I like the chaos era that CCP is working on. I have many thoughts about the cyno changes and the blackout, but just so I'm clear, what are you thinking of as Mechanic X and Mechanic Y?
---
A wasteland, but null is atm the only place that can support a large population with a hardcore/casual mix of players that want the player controlled aspect of the game (and that is the only draw eve has on me). Going wh, low or hisec is not a viable option for any of the nullblocks.
---
And blops
---
Because they want to teleport into null like Chad McShip and dunk some fools while flying away like cool guys not looking at explosions.
---
Fucking suitonia complains that he cannot assault and reinforce/kill a jump bridge next to a keepstar without loosing a ship to the DD.
---
Imagine wanting to kill alliance level infrastructure, with 5 people and demand to take no losses from an active, gunned, 300bn isk structure.
---
How has noone mentioned "the guy who has to refuel all the corp's structures?"
---
How is your analogy even remotely relevant? There’s nothing stopping you from defending yourself in this new world.
---
That's awesome. Do more things like this CCP
---
Noone looks at local anymore since it doesnt matter
---
I sincerely don't understand what you are asking or what it has to do with my answer to OP... are you sure you replied to the right comment?
---
Triggering wormholers is too easy.
---
I agree, entry to Eve is still daunting, I tried to only use information presented to me via the tutorials to do things, it would be. Confusing, the whole NPE needs work.
---
There needs to be a skill tree like the ship tree to help people out as well,
---
Dig through the channel menus. Join Constellation and Region chat.
---
Congratulations, well done for getting out there.
---

7.The first 3 times you die in this fit send me a zkill link in game and I will send you isk to replace it.

Have fun, make eve dangerous
---
🇺🇸 Hell yeah brother 🇺🇸
---
In fact that is very likely the reason why this will not happen. CCP might have crazy ideas and there are in fact no limits what they might do, but they know that ppl take long breaks and would never come back if they basically start at 0 with nothing.
---
I can't deny, if jita would blow up and i would lose everything that i have stored there, i might not have the will to come online, as 95% of what i own would be lost over night.
---
Three times in a row?
---
Wait whoever said that lmao
---
If you are spending 20 hrs a week to have fun you are doing something seriously wrong
---
Ahhhhh this is why they don't want me jita ganking. Blue is only a colour right?
---
It never is. Last time i checked one that was claiming to be offering 80% (in highsec, we get higher than that in wormhole space) was actually offering closer to 47% if you evepraisaled the stuff yourself.
---
Go roam in lowsec. Still has Local, and people that like fighting, so it sounds like it's the right playground for you.
---
P. S no do not drop a torp launcher for a probe launcher. The aim of the game is deeeeeps. Train covops as high as possible this will increase the deeps
---
Any questions message me.
---
Yup, if I didn’t know what I do now I would simply get destroyed over and over. Following storyline will show you some things you need to know but without interacting with experienced players you are practically screwed when it comes to the more niche mechanics of this game.
---
I try to talk to new players regularly and it's honestly astonishing how many get sucked into shitty hisec mining corps, and what's even more irritating is that it's incredibly tough to get them to try something else.
---
Makes my head hurt, very frustrating.
---
It's called Perimeter
---
If by additional documentation you mean, any of the vectors I describe above (BGP hijacking, DNS/Subdomain takeover, DNS TXT update, Email compromise etc.) yeah... they certainly require all of the same exact things specified in the CABF that LetsEncrypt complies with.
---
If you wanna educate yourself on the latest it's here: [https://cabforum.org/baseline-requirements-documents/](https://cabforum.org/baseline-requirements-documents/) Every CA needs to comply with the Baseline Requirements to stay in browsers.
---
&gt; Dictating that players must use nullsec for your and CCP's idea of "high risk, high reward
---
The risk/reward balance (and consequently null being a high risk/high reward place) is not a player choice. If it was, then we wouldn't have mechanics like CONCORD, gate guns, and so on. The risk/reward is actively enforced by CCP and the game design. It is advertised by game trailers. It is a very essential Eve mechanic yields an interesting game, and has been here since Eve's creation. Yes, it is pretty much dictated. Making null safer than hisec shouldn't be a choice in a well-designed Eve.
---
&gt; Do you ACTUALLY think that people are just going to sit there happily being farmed to death
---
I believe many people won't take the new deal involving higher risk. But that's also a good development. It means less faucets and a more sustainable Eve macroeconomy. Ofc some farmers will quit. But also many from the offending side are more active with blackout than ever.
---
&gt; If nullsec pve becomes unprofitable
---
None of this is about nullsec being unprofitable or nullseccers being "farmed to death". It is merely a taxation problem. In taxation problems you try to reach to an optimal number which won't be too oppressive to the tax payer (so he keeps his activities), yet high enough to match the needs of the overall system (healthcare et al in real life, content in Eve). Average null farmer loses something like 5% of his farm to hunters (3% in umbrella regions). I argue that 15% is a better ratio for the health of this game; so the risk is not too oppressive yet creates sufficient content. If it ever becomes higher than that, you will see me arguing that the risk in null is just too high. 
---
So think of this as a tax you need to pay from your null farm for the very game to work. It's no different than hisec transaction taxes etc.
---
&gt; "geniuses" at CCP finally realizes that no matter what stupid changes they make to game mechanics, they can't force the pvers to feed kills when there aren't any pvers left. So, they "consider upping the rewards"
---
They already lost a great number from the hunting, content-seeking players due to the current stagnation and safety in the last few years. The changes are attempts to address that stagnation and safety. You'll have to trust CCP on whether which balance is more profitable for them. 
---
They are not stupid. They are far more on top of what's happening than you and the other disgruntled nullsec linemembers.
---

---
" This makes pvp the main goal for anyone going into null, if you can complete other goals on the side that’s fine.  "   
---
False, the main goal is to allow player based empire building, PVP is a component of that, but not the be all end all of nullsec.
---
Shitposter, it's a dirty job but someone has to do it
---
Imagine logging into eve in 2019
---
" Upcoming cyno changes: great if you want to roam into null for fights without getting dropped as much "   
---
Wrong, super and titan drops are going to be replaced with recon and covert ops drops. Instead of having 20 carriers dropped on you, you will get 30 or 40 stratios and a pile of bombers instead.
---
So you always have the ability to MJD if you need to.
---
I think theres room for both playstyles, personally i liked the empire side better. I liked the us vs them large scale conflict side. Being on campaign in a good active war against the other blocks. All the big brawls and all the drama that goes with it. IMO thats what the focus of null should be. The ability of null blocks to wage war on eachother should not be impeded at all. With all the timers and cyno jammers no wonder null seems so safe. The dangerous side of whalers vs krabbs is perfectly valid but to me its just a sideshow, something you would do on a Thursday afternoon when theres no big objectives to go for. It shouldnt be the focus of changes to null. Fozziesov needs major adjustments so do citadel mechanics and cynojammers. Blackout is cool but it shouldnt just be a carbon copy of wormhole space, null needs a local tuned to null mechanics. there is a thousand ways  they  can do local, we shouldnt have the exact same mechanics as wormhole space or highsec/lowsec.
---
Bro What are you talking about.
---
Stealth bomber/ Combat scanner (Frigate) cynos in a black ops which bridges in force recons (cruisers) and cyno in capitals. This pretty much religates cynos onto frigs and cruisers exclusively, and it is a further consolidation of power with the major groups.
---
Souns about like me, been playing for 2 months and i was ready to plex my main on the second month, just plexed my 3rd and now i'm basically printing isk with a rattlesnake running c5 with my buddies.
---
Yeh i had a ton of characters. Like 5 accounts, 3 characters each, almost all of them 30-40m so, with my 3 main characters each having 100-150m SP
---
Actually, don't need to keep it alive even, just get it anchored.
---
It will then save a few billion of JF and cargo while it lives.
---
In his analogy you can defend the walls (i.e. your sov structures) but you can't defend the people trying to make a living (i.e. the ratters/miners). In the real world this doesn't work. And if people don't find a solution in eve it won't work there either.
---
Its 3.3m, +/- 10%. You can do a maximum of 3 capital jumps unless you are super lucky
---
You can sell to buy orders without a problem
---
I don't know what you're talking about I've got more content on a single mining run than 5x the average gate camp.
---
&gt;If by additional documentation you mean, any of the vectors I describe above 
---
Nope, I don't.  Because the actual "additional documentation" requires real-world steps, not just electronic ones.
---
&gt;If you wanna educate yourself
---
If you wanna educate yourself, you'd find what the difference between identify verification and encryption are.  'Cause encryption alone doesn't provide identity verification.
---
A Let's Encrypt DV certificate provides encryption....and that's about it.  But they're fantastic for phishing attacks since there's plenty of people out there who think a padlock in the address bar means identity verification.
---
I use standard Crash boosters when the cruisers are being an issue. Honestly the drone swarm almost instant vollies cruisers. The super low sig radius is just for when I'm ratting in magnetars
---

---
&gt; Nope.
---
&gt; He can't pay broker fees.
---
If you quick sell, do you still get broker fees? I thought fees were for setting up orders.
---
Okay I’ll give you that point. But why not on combat cruisers instead. I’ve thought about this more. I don’t like how you can cyno in a BO to bridge in the force recons on field which can cyno in the other dudes. 
---
But fucking ships you don’t see is a little annoying. There’s gonna be too many cloaky gangs and nobody’s gonna ecm on their falcon.
---
So it's like how some players go after miners and haulers to keep the price of ore and minerals up?
---
Contract old stuff to alt and sell with alt
---
Main issue is having a C6 RG. My last C6 was an RG, and we got attacked all the time. Russians are like cockroaches, that only like living in The RGs.

---
Not quite sure how you get that anoms in null are keen to pve...

Yes, thats what combat recon ships are for yo.
---
If it takes 20 hours to find content you're doing it wrong. https://timerboard.net/ go to your closest system here and start looking for shit with your boyz.
---
Go to Jita 4-4 and look through the buy orders. Or contract them all to a public area and just have a “skins sale”. Depending on the rarity of the skins, and for what ships, you can get quite a lot of ISK.
---
I wonder if CCP has the stats on how much isk asset wise actually sits in 4-4 and if it were to die without asset safety what the raw damage would be.
---
I'll admit that when I looked at my character's profile on Zkill I was pretty unhappy about it, but I think that means I just need to stay away from the site. I don't want to feel pressured into getting my score up and burning out on it...

---
No Concord
---
Which we usually did.
---
I don’t understand the opposition of arranging a fight.  As ling as the outcome is not predetermined, what’s the downsite?  Players got a fight, which is the thing they were looking for.  
---
The fight is meaningless?  Arranged wars where bith sides agree to not do too much damage to each other is meaningless, that I understand.  But roaming gangs (normally) aren’t out evicting sov or burning structures.  Wouldn’t an organically arising fight between roaming gangs where the FCs never conversed be meaningless by this metric?
---
I’m genuinely looking to understand this dislike of finding an arranged fight when roaming.
---
No :c
---
Bro man. Let me start off by saying that you’re wrong. You’re getting a fraction of isk that it used to be from before the capital escalation nerf. You should be eternally salty at how poor you are right now.
---
You gotta not be smug about that right now. The 0.0 dudes are really salty they can’t plex accounts dude. Don’t give them a reason to destroy the last honest way of making isk.

Yes, but it doesn't change the drive of the post.  Just swap “tax” with “brokers fees” and his point still stands.

I can't help but think that would lead to some unpleasant consequences for everyone who participated. From a lore perspective, CCP can't really let capsuleers blow up the Caldari's main trade station without the State responding in force...

Why can’t you defend the ratters and miners? It seems to me that you indeed can but it’s just more work than It used to be. And riskier.
---
Purifiers on the drifters are really easy. You set them up and forget until it dies (one reload, but you can use laser ships or drakevacs etc instead). Once you figure out a way to manage your monitor space ([mine is here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpiYxq3mpD8)) I'm sure it's not more apm intensive than having to use missiles on your individual rattles.

u scout the citadel and not much going on there but you keep am eye there as this is usually bait then you engange the bait with a sizeable fleet and suddenly 30-40 ppl log in which previosly logged out aroumd the bait

sometimes they also log off half their fleet at the wh and so on

Concord can't even defend people in hisec. And they have a lot more tools than any player alliance. What are you even talking about?

---
Ah yes.
---
Word
---
Please explain how these changes (I assume you’re referring to cynos but maybe not) make it impossible to defend ratters and miners, and how pre change mechanics make it possible.
---
Yup, we might be getting a Trig dread.
---
controversial opinion its not a payer flown ship
---
That would be a nice way to reintroduce player-owned stations that *aren't* citadels; reuse the current POS assets for a build-your-own-station mechanic, maybe even let us build our own complexes like what you can find in deadspace sites.
---
Oohhhh thats why they raised the fucking taxes....
---
This is why corps fail: undue focus on the trivial and the inane.
---
Trig POS?=)
---
Fuck me, that would be amazing to see, and the rage...oh god, the rage.
---
Ah, I see. Interestingly, I've run a few impromptu 5-person kitchen sink roams, and participated in quite a few more. I can't remember the last time I've seen a defense fleet though. We would attack ratters because they were the only things in space, and then they'd either cyno up for a capital drop or die quietly.
---
And let's be clear, we'd attack ratters even if they weren't the only things in space, because we'd attack *everything* that we had the faintest hope of killing.
---
I have seen the occasional defense fleet when I deliberately crash into someone's staging and hang out. And yeah, when 5 of us set up a gate camp in Brave staging, we die horribly. That's still true now. It's also still fun.
---
If I understand correctly, you don't mind risk in your PVE, but it bothers you that 5 drunks in kitchen sink ships with no elaborate setup get to be the ones killing you. That's fair, but it seems to me that if it really is 5 drunks in kitchen sink ships with no setup... shouldn't they be even more vulnerable to your defense fleet now than they were before? You just have to undock it.
---
Wait, that was actually a thing at some point?
---
Have seen this type of behavior on occasion but did not know it was a common Russian thing, Good to know.
---
Keepstars get blown up, not often but they do die.

Then you realize, over at zkill 40 has been destroyed.

Do you always roll all the holes in the static, and you roll with the rorq? I don't know its mass but it feels like this need a bit of logistic

---
I use a blaster, a-type ab, a-type armor rep into enyo or wolf(autocannon). Especially works in highsec. It may run slower than some other fits, but the speed is really helpful if you find a site that a Gila is halfway through and you want to snatch the loot
---
Correct, they can walk around just fine in their body.
---
Wow, that looks fun.
---
So... all that talk about phasing out POS and replacing them with Citadels... and now the Trig are setting up POS towers and floating structures like the good old days?
---
Here I went in wormholes with 6 accounts for a total of 34m haha. The rorq thing seems really fun, it doesn't cost that much but getting the rorq could be annoying, and rolling things alone has never been fun
---
You acted like a retard in a corp you had just joined. You then ask if the corp is for you and he gave you a clear answer. Not exactly a graceful answer but honestly it saves everyone time at the end of the day. Somehow I highly doubt this was the only instance of you causing problems in the corp.

HG ascendancy? judging by the number of LP - High sec? I spend a lot of time on the road to burner and back for agent. usually 4 jumps in one direction, sometimes 6. given that I'm in Amarr space there big warps 40+- a.e.  i cant do more than 5 in hour with roll missions and travel/ 2 mins to fight and 5 to travel =) i use 1 window without ascendancy. any advice?
---
It's certainly vertical enough.
---
&gt; The most important thing about null is that it is dangerous.
---
the most important thing is that there is no NPC police to save you, and there are none of the "rules" that govern lowsec and highsec, that doesn't necessarily mean it is dangerous.
---
&gt; (yey meaningless arranged fights)
---
How does that make them meaningless? That sounds like a solution to Goonswarm's issues with boredom because it means the sides are relatively equal and the fight could go either way instead of it being a one-sided slaughter.

Tbf, according to lore regular titans are basically a more efficient version of the Iapetan titans, as in they are built around their doomsday weapon and require way less power for these weapons. The reason Iapetan titans are so scary is that warping one near a planet seriously fucks with the gravity of said planet since it just got a new moon in terms of mass. So expect earthquakes, vulcano eruptions and the like. Just the presence of a Iapetan Titan will royally fuck up planets.  
---
In terms of firepower a few capsuleer-piloted Titans will outclass a Iapetan Titan though.
---
Trigs, wat r u doin letting capsuleers into your construction sites? Do you *want* them to get blown up?

Sooo, you do you hate yourself or what?

you forgot the mandatory comissair of white paper violators

---
Blobs of cloaked bullshit is boring too though.
---
Also there were so many people here crying that capital application needed nerfing, that I don't think ""we don't care about capital targets" is a valid representation of self proclaimed hunters.
---
Hell there were people here getting tons of upvotes for saying "capitals shouldn't be able to apply damage to subcaps" which is a ludicrous idea, and comes from a desire to get easy kills on the most powerful ships in the game.

&gt; If I understand correctly, you don't mind risk in your PVE, but it bothers you that 5 drunks in kitchen sink ships with no elaborate setup get to be the ones killing you
---
Nope, that’s not it at all.  Preparation and effort should have some connection with success.  Almost-zero-effort should do horrible when it runs straight into massive preparation.
---
And these changes do the opposite.
---
&gt; shouldn't they be even more vulnerable to your defense fleet now than they were before?
---
No local means that fleet can’t find the drunks.
---
good
---
Looks like something you'd use against Sansha incursions and their omni damage. Or maybe it's something that will make frigates durable enough to fight in cap battles, at least for a little while?
---
I took the screen not CCP and the Devs...
---
Let’s encrypt “verifies” with the equivalent of a pinky-swear and an email.  That’s why they’re handing out DV certificates.
---
The others require things like actually verifying your physical address.  And that your company actually exists.  Which is why they’re handing out EV certificates.
---
not really, they are still only going to drop on people they know they can insta delete and then leave, they are still only going to use this style of fight to gank targets. there will be no resulting "gud fights" because if the gank doesn't go their way they just warp out and clock up.

I wonder if they'll all 3 be in the same Group. Since it says only 1 of this Group allowed. Could you toss either or both onto a HAC along with an ADC?

Right, sorry.
---
Supers and titans are main issue if you own some structures at lowsec and if you have some will to protect them against group like snuff.
---
The only counterplay is like dock and play other games.

Sure It’s not problem to small group that can throwaway all stuffs and dock tbh

Small Trig Citadel? If so, Upwell Small Citadels can be expected. In any case, it looks very interesting.

Dunno, I'm not a mobile developer.

A lot of people would. EVEdroid got a lot of bad reviews when their fitting tool broke

They fly already replaced because too many people have too much money. That's on CCP but maybe they're working to fix that.

Danger: Risk isn’t worth the reward
---
Too safe: Reward doesn’t carry enough risk
---
Rewards might be ISK, fame or any number ways people have fun in EVE.
---
ISK the most discussed and impactful example.  Many ways to make it but too many ways good ISK can be made with little player effort, let alone botting.  Not just in null, but most null space had and probably still has better risk/reward ratio in the Age of Chaos.  Blackout certainly upped the risk but with so many alts in any given alliance, setting up cloaked gate sentries mitigates some of the risk if you’re not afk ratting/mining.
---
There also isn’t enough reward to battle over sov, probably less so for the bigger groups. Give them a reason to undertake the effort.  I’m sure we all can list a variety of ways to reduce the complications or increase the rewards for taking sov.
---
Hauling bot needs an update
---
AFAIK legacy doesn't have a cit in the lowsec around podion, which means that all of their JFs going that way would have to use stations.
---
I cant tell you why to fight, there are a lot of reasons that have nothing to do with increased risk for PvE farming in capital ships to fight and kill nerds. Something tells me you arent one that's real quick to get your ass into fleet anyway so I dont know why I bother
