The issue at hand, if we consider the small gang playstyle, is that nothing nerfed it, only buffer the other one. That's the whole of the issue : small gang space of choice was always lowsec more than nullsec, but lowsec is dead or filled with the same supercapital drop shit as nullsec.
---

---
I agree with you that buffing reward while increasing risk is the way to go, but it needs to be done elsewhere too : If hunters HAVE to be in nullsec to have content, then the risk will never outweigth the rewards unless it is stupidly high.
---
As for the "get a dreadbomb" part, it is purely satirical : I know most people are not the basic half retarded bunch of reddit smallganger we find here. There are obviously not many things you can do in a solo fashion, I myself was a fan of MrHyde/bigmiker and those things will be sorely missed, but you cannot expect a coordinated empire to let you kill their krabs in peace, even if it's too easy for them.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
WHer spent their time here saying they can kill more people now and WH krabbing is better. They have to understand one thing : Today nobody in nullsec, except INIT once, cares about them. If it comes to a more risky nullsec, Wormholes will be the prime tool used to hunt people doing PvE. 
---
What do you think will happen to wormholes entities not based in Thera that will bother, I don't know, Goons tranquility ? They will get blobbed to the death and evicted from their home by an angry bunch of F1 monkeys.
---
I'm not fond of that, but I believe it will happen regardless, and the HK thing proved that nobody can do anything against it.
---
---
---
Never been 99% safe. If you think about, now also more risky for the gankers for sometimes they can't run as a chickens when the pve people do a counter attack. Before they know how many people we have inside the systems and engage or not. Now can appear 2 titans before you start targeting someone. You don't know if its a bait, if its a real pve player... 
---
And about the SRP not all the alliances have that, it need pve players and if you only think there are like 5 alliances, maybe you don't know so much about the game. And also i don't think you want have a 2-3-4-5 alliances on null, and all the others on high.
---
Caldari should have an ice hauler called the Penguin.
---
Spying on your own corp for no other reason than killmails. This is peak Eve gameplay.
---
Bob's work my friend!
---
I fully expect all excavator hunters will just be happy bombing Miner IIs then.  
---
Nope.,.enjoy your excavator mining in your ‘abandoned’ regions while you can.  If you just get bombed out every week or two you will find the economics of it not in your favor.  
---
Ride the dead meta to its conclusion mate.
---
Removing the bounties is a fine start, printing ISK was never a good thing.
---
As it stands with the nerf, combat anomalies spawn are already nerfed to oblivion, but the problem was never combat, it was ore anomalies.
---
Wanna fix the ISK making potential of Ore anoms ? Remove the afk part of every (and I mean every) mining ship. Make it so it requires user input, it won't prevent bot but it will alleviate the multiboxing problem that rorquals, and barges in a near future,  are.
---
We have already all the data.
---
They are split.
---
So i ask CCP to regroup everything in the MER.
---
It's not be salty, it's not drama. It's just a thing about data, read my historic of conversation with falcon when i ask if the have data scientist, he saif they could share information if we know what we want. First step is maybe to have a single source for all data. 
---
You understand or you are to stupid ?
---
how long until most of the responses are from nullbloc tards?
---
ill give it 2 hours
---
It's all ogre, literally only Horde, Goons and Tapi left in nullsec, the rert died :(
---
You're mom have keep mine. Can you go to search it ?Thank
---
Any serious krabber would notice that on the first tick, warp to you, screen shot and you'd get dumped for blue fucking.
---
AND...if pve/mining/etc is more dangerous prices go up for everything
---
No kill mail for T2. 
---
Without proof of your leet PvP skill with a kill mail, I expect most people will actually look for other things to do.

This
---
I mean I dont know where I said that. Do you?
---
I have run Oneiros with Remote Sebos. Overheat scram on Maulus Navy, ezpz. Range bonus plus bonus to scram strength, not a promise to instalock, but whatever you do lock up isn't going anywhere fast, not even with warp core stabs :D
---
I feel like you go through cycles of insightful meaningful posts followed by long droughts of brain dead coolaid consumption.
---
Depend of what kind of group you look.
---
If you look small pvp only alliance, they just hunt (and find so few target outside ubrella so ...).
---
If you speack of small alliance who try to play collective to build something, they are dead, beacause when you haven't the firepower to stop 200 bomber with no local, you are just food.
---
The problem is depending on the space small alliances don’t get the numbers to even unsafely and smartly make much isk. It does however seem to be having a good impact on non jita markets
---
&gt;and it comes with shakes!
---
Like... Banana? Vanilla? Whatever, I'm in.
---
i can say the exact same thing, why i should be penalize cause i haven't shipspin for 2 year ? 
---
i understand that but the only other solution is "delete SP" i don't known if this would be a good idea

GOTG working with PH against GOTG renters/botters?
---
I'm kinda confused
---
I tend to agree with Goon in this thread. Just add more shitfit rorquals, back to square one.
---
Almost on my region, the players with more income are the explorers with quite zero risk and now they can keep doing exploration. They are not taxed, they only have to do an minesweeper mini-game and they can get really good reward and they are mostly cloak. 
---
Without the taxes, the small alliances won't be able to support their infrastructure and with 4-5 shitty gankers who come and run as a chickens you can't pay the concord bills. CCP its trying to make us all go to the huge alliances and forget the most of the map just for someone can try to catch a easy kill sometimes?
---
SLYCE isn't in gotg anymore after this [incident](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bmncxn/slyce_kicked_from_gotg_to_protect_chinese_renting/.
---
find a mining op, flash combat probes, watch them scurry, roll in with a prospect and steal some goo
---
If any fight back they will run as a chickens. Crying everywhere. 
---
\- They have too many bubbles and we can't run when they counter attack
---
\- They defend themselves, we want only easy kills
---
\- We are losing luxury ships for **maybe**  catch a solitaire rorqual-carrier-vni
---
I think some are not bully in real life, they bully people and just extand this on internet .
---
I know some very good pvp player (you know some guys who don't ask for super easy kill... i know one in assault frigate alone he could make a super run away if super pilot make a mistake). And guess what they like PVE people and do'nt flame they. 
---
The actual grrr pve is due to plex price i think for a good part. People think it's due to PVE plex price skyrocket, so they wan tmassive PVE nerf. They just forget something call parity of buy power.
---
For most of us we don't truly dislike you. EVE is an RPG, so every single one of us is RPing on some level. Since PVEers are targets, and we shoot at you everyday, we RP like you're the enemy. 
---
The immersion in this RP is enhanced by the way many PVEers react when you blow them up - instead of a sportsmanlike "gf", they frequently seem to rant and rave, froth at the mouth, and go straight for racist or homophobic slurs. 
---
To add to that, the forums are always cluttered with demands by PVEers to make the game more safe for them by hobbling PVPers in one way or another. We tend to resent this a bit precisely because CCP pays attention. In my ten years or so I've seen hundreds of nerfs intended to make PVEers more safe, and only exactly one change (the nullsec blackout) to make things more dangerous.
---
So yeah, it is very easy to RP that you're the hated enemy. That said, some of you are cool - those who buy a mining permit and obey the Code, mostly.
---
Clubbing seals that will soon go extinct
---
They can be pretty nasty fit correctly, just be careful
---
He does not appear to be saying exactly that.
---
&gt;500k - Core skills, cruiser and below to 5 BC/BS to 4 small weapons to 5 med large to 4 
---
My interpretation is that you would be able to inject destroyers using the full 500k SP regardless of your current SP.
---
&gt;This does two things, **removes the barrier of using injectors from long term players** and **reduces the efficiency of injecting cap toons**, it also allows people to get into the mainline doc ships without feer of the SP penalty hitting them after the 5m SP point. 
---
Anything that makes it more "difficult" to inject capitals is good for the game, but this seems like another proposal that assumes the reason CCP arent fixing this is because they dont know how to do it.
---
It would be easier to cap injection at say 25m (this is enough for 1-2 "professions" at reasonable skill levels) and restrict cap skills completely. This meets the requirement of helping new players while also protecting the integrity of the mid/late game content.
---
Cuz they suck at DSCAN?
---
Do it for 1 tick, and then move like 3 jumps over and do the same thing. Then repeat. No one will ever know it's you if you keep moving, unless the corp sets up a bot to read the tax logs for similar values.
---
Oh man I'd fit smartbombs and farm so many atrons :3
---
If you look the zkill gankers are losing a LOT of ships 
---
They are killing less easy kills than before the BO
---
PVE players are counter attacking much more than before the BO 
---
Less PVE active playing, its killing the small alliances, and the big alliances keep doing the same as before the BO. 
---
Did you think its that good for the easy kill/no ability pilots?
---
If a Rifter can kill his Rorqual, he must be a Darkness player.
---
Only alliance where I have killed their Rorqs, fit with only a bunch of LARGE shield extenders and one of those asteroid scanners.
---
I know that guy! He is pretty cool tbh.
---
Ok, I laughed at this. Thank you.
---
Inside whormole you can't cyno... and covert cyno. For people who don't know covert cyno are NOT on overview if you are not in field.
---
So you move an alt somewhere you go to a point impossible in theory to reach. (some people have explain how to make point in impossible position with abyssal site in this reddit when blackout start) 
---
Now you covert cyno you're friend with dscan immunity or cloack. and you leav system the guys see you leave he think he is alone. 
---
Inside WH you see the guys leave it's overt he can't have bring his friend. So stop compare 0.0 and WH mechanic. They are different. 
---
And if the post creator said 4 account are not enought to be in security in 0.0... if he is not in capital or super and under umbrella, yes he will die very fast.
---
And none of that matters at all if nothing is destroyed. Pvpers and pvers are dependent on eachother.
---
&gt;deepsafe
---
&gt;they can see you on dscan
---
ok
---
That was always the case, this just makes it easier for us to kill more of them
---
I was in Delve a couple hours ago and saw plenty of Excavator drones.
---
Frat has been fitting quad warp core stabs to their VNI's. Probably will fit stabs to myrms/domis now that the VNI is dead.
---
No, literally, you need to find a better translation program, because you are making no sense.  
---
As to what you are asking, a single source for data is just you being too fucking lazy to grab the data yourself like everyone else does.  Get a better IT guy, it will make your life much easier.
---
Some line members were a bit worried when our CEO said that you had to get a super, rorq, or freighter on your main's killboard each week or be kicked. Fortunately, their fears were misplaced; living next to Deklein has allowed us to preserve our entire membership without undue hassle for anyone. All small null groups may not so have been so lucky, I'm afraid.  
---
(Seriously, though, the blackout has been fantastic.)
---
Add a skill loss when you lose a cap/super, just like T3Cs and we might just start seeing the end of rorquals online...
---
God if your flair isn’t ironic on this mate
---
&gt;well before 10m SP, which is the "lossless" zone for injectors
---
I thought the DR started at 5m, not 10m.
---
Eve Online's backbone is in it's player-run economy. PvE players are bound to make very little income in highsec unless they are willing to multibox, grind or take part in incursions. I think that these individuals who have played other games and have been incubated in highsec feel as though they should be able have access to the same commodities that make a fair amount of ISK in the lower security spaces without the increased risk. Some of these players find themselves in null or lowsec eventually as a means to begrudgling create wealth for themselves.  
---
The trouble with these sentiments is that when vocalised they can seem threatening. Giving *even* easier access to nullsec/lowsec commodities would cause the in-game economy to spiral and this makes people uncomfortable for good reason.
---
Every time I lose a ship worth more then 300mil I come away with a major rush. It's because, for me at least, losing a ship is like losing my irl car. All the work that went into making isk to buy it, the couple hours to fit it, and then the tens of hours flying it it's like you bond with that ship. Then in an instant it's gone. All that work. All the time. Mind you I do fly a few ships that are worth a bill plus. But it's the feeling of 'i made this' and then it's all taken away. As soon as the structure buzzer starts going its what I imagine an athlete feels right at the finish line, or more appropriate when a ship an engineer/scientist feels when it goes dark.
---
What size monitors do all of you use for Eve? I’m a bit torn between 2 x 24” or 27” and ultra wide. I’m keen to get a monitor that works with AMD Freesync and is 1440p. Any recommendations would be great.
---
I wonder what their logger is worth.
---
Good kill - we had some fun brawls over that Rorq earlier in the evening.
---
Good job! We've been killing this dudes freighters and trying to get that rorqual for the past week but we always got outgunned when they brung in the response fleet.
---
This is not Black Desert though, you retard :D

Not even remotely true.

Spell. Check.

not really, I remember your name. the thing is, when you're the most retarded player a game can offer, people recognize you
---
Not even close. Thanks for trying.
---
Just average them 😂
---
No, Hell No
---
How was it "safer than highsec"?  Did you have Concord to protect you from everything except wardecs?  Did you have all of your space cynojammed?  Were the rats all but impotent?  Did you have safe and easy access to unlimited level 4 missions?  Did your space have a route to the greatest market hub in the game guarded by Concord?
---
Or was it the efforts of your alliance-mates and allies, both in and out of game, that offered some level of safety?
---
I find it interesting that the few small groups that can't be assed to put in the work, organization and effort that others have can make such a stink and want to tear down and nullify the work that others have built over years/decades.
---
I used to do a lot of tackle for my corp when hunting in wormholes
---
The pressure of not fucking up and thus wasting hours of hunting combined with the amount of build up before the maybe two minutes of action would have my hands shaking so bad i could barely hit the right key on the key board.
---
small alliances doesn't ror

Escort carriers - can launch one light or ss fighter squad.  No support.

Fleetboss can see all bounty payouts. Just ask the Fleetboss to look real quick.
---
And most of them, yes. 
---
Of course some of them are super good on pvp but go to kill a VNI with 30 Black Ops are not really a good pvp move. Looks like that video of the CEO of goons making fun of a mail from a miner with really bad life moment and asking to all the theater assistants to send mails to the player for make him decide about suicide.
---

The point of the PLEX with high price its good. I can't understand why people think its bad.  If i spend 20€ on a PLEX i want get so much ISK as its possible. If you make down the price of the PLEX, for sure it will contract the offer and the price will stay at the same value. 
---
At the end, EVE its an libertarian economy game. All works will offer-demand system. You can learn more about economics on one year playing this than in the most part of the college hours in economics subjects, for this game show you the rules of the unaltered markets on practice. 
---
Try to explain that in non my mother language take me some time and effort.  
---
People chose the products depending the value they think it have. If CCP try to do an alteration of the price of the plex, some people, most of them, will chose non buying plex(s) or buying them on RTM... and more when that 1B now have really less value on the market than before the BO. If before the BO a item from null pve cost 500M now they cost 600-700M for that, the players with interest of buying some plex for skill injectors or use a carrier or just use a pvp ship will prefer save their money and will less offer of plex in the market, the price will keep at 2-2.5B like been before the BO. 
---
For that, the plex price can't be an excuse for give all the advantage to the lovely bunny predator or to the big alliances, like its happening with goons (or other big alliances) who just switch excavators for T2 Miner drones and keep doing tons of isk per hour and they keep 24h mining/ratting.
---
To see if you're worth killing and to see if you have a combat recon with you.
---
Why are titans scared of combat probes :thinking:
---
That's the correct mindset. I don't mind changes that make Hisec slightly safer, especially for new players, since the risk there should always be relatively low. Obviously complete safety should never be a consideration since Eve is a semi-sandbox. The problem comes in when players want access to the most lucrative PvE risk/reward ratio activity in the game and threaten to leave when the risk is slightly increased.
---
Consider this - nothing in the last month fundamentally changed about the game's core mechanics. Local wasn't even removed from 3/4 of space security levels. You hear a lot of null PvE players saying it will kill null activity. Strange, if null is so dead now, why aren't they out mining and ratting? Why don't they cut the risk slightly and relocate to lowsec, where they can have much faster and more accurate enemy intel? It's very obvious, even to a casual observer, that these are entrenched, entitled individuals with no concern for balance. That's why people have a problem with the mindset.
---
stop posting about shit you know nothing about, you haven't been in a small scale fight in years. 
---
Why do you have to be this retarded
---
Then you should have no problem coordinating real time intel, with such an expansive network established.
---
Yikes

now that this is top upvoted, /u/CCP_Falcon plz ill love you forever

Good riddance to this fuck.

No
---
Ikr. If you can lose your rorqual (WHICH IS A LITERAL CAPITAL WITH AN “OH SHIT” BUTTON THAT LASTS 4 MINUTES BASE) to drifter subcaps you have far FAR bigger problems
---
The other side of the coin though is that EvE online is the only place that you can truly build an empire, or be a market mogul, or spy with some actual weight. A spy in a WoW guild or faction is near useless. Want to build the largest stations or ships, you can. Want to lead groups of 100s of pilots against another massive fleet you can. In EvE you have so many options which is where EvE stands far above the rest of MMO sand boxes. Now things can come crashing down if you are back stabbed or ganged up on. There are real consequences for your actions and the risks you do or do not take. That is what makes EvE dangerous.
---
no but fcan youi explain the meme. i remember dat one guy yelling ARMOORRRR HAAAACSSSSS!? in a video but idk why
---
I feel you, I totally messed up a tackle, I learned and my corp is positive and chill so it was ok, but I felt bad.

Battle Helios is always scary. My vicious drone will eat your heart out. :)

If you dock in a citadel they remain out too

Im mostly confused by this "now the vni is pvp ship" post increase.

Im glad it got its nerf for afk annom farming, but the vni has been a mobile sledgehammer for small gang forever.
---
This is shitting you pants  in line at lunch so you can have extra pudding
---
God dammit, this is why we should have dropped a third bomb.
---
&gt; How was it "safer than highsec"?
---
because more things die in high sec?
---
Yeah that will be awesome, strap all the MWDs to a Keepstar and go on tour.
---
&gt; I'm a pvper, and my experience is that you want maximum safety for yourself, and minimum safety for the target
---
Then you're not, i want maximum risk for everybody involved, thats what somebody who likes to PVP wants.  You're a risk averse bully.
---
I’m sorry?
---
so this is what peak salt looks like, but it sounds like TEXAS LAW
---
if you knew you had a good bookmark, you could have done the warp in, bomb and then cloak.
---
It's funny that you point to this devolution being something that enhances your RP experience but then I remember the most hateful stuff I've heard online outside of angry people in FPS is in null-sec and low-sec corporations as they dick around in standing fleets.
---
You’re not a “veteran pilot” if there are frigs you can’t fly, my dude.
---
Because deep deep down they know that the PvE players are the main reason the game is still alive and they resent both the PvE players and CCP for catering to that aspect of the game.
---
All the skills already have a training time multiplyer, would a possible good solution be to make it exponential when applying free sp?
---
there was
---
the decade i've been playing, and my caldari frigate 4 disagree?
---
I haven't played in a while.  What VNI changes?
---
I wasn’t positive if it would have worked all the time. We thought they were going to move around. 
---
Though that’s a good plan for the future, thank you.
---
Blame Cable for rushing me whilst I was also our out cyno etc. :(
---
Let them create their strawman lmao.
---
You see, the criticism isn't even focused on pve or hisec specifically - both are just common signs of another issue. EVE gameplay happens a lot around people interacting with each other - be it cooperation or competition - and a lot of the criticism goes to that. The issue people have with certain playstyles is that said playstyles are oriented at reducing/removing amount of possible interaction with other players as much as possible. Looking at hisec specifically, note how a lot of people don't really mind incursions while they shit on people who just run L4 missions - both are comparable in terms of making ISK, but incursions due to their nature require some level of cooperation and virtually disallow "singleplayer playstyle".
---
In fact, I've seen repeated statements made by "hardcore pvpers" about people who do pve nowadays - they miss times when, after they got ratting/mining ship tackled - they could hold it tackled and wait a bit until he called friends and get them to save him in whatever kitchensink subcap fleet they could muster, to get a fight or even just few kills for either side. But now? Now they complain about  people warping off immediately, VNIs/Myrmidons that nobody minds dying from time to time, mining capitals and people dropping superblobs to cut the interaction down as fast as possible and let everyone go to playing the game on their own.
---
Of course, there are exceptions and people who will go far in their opinions/statements, but those will always be there. But in general, as long as you try to get involved with other players randomly (even via smallgang pvp you mention - without pushing yourself hard, just trying once in a while and maybe getting used to it, to reduce amount of stress it causes), you'll seem fine for most. Or stop caring about what some random people on the internet think about you and play the game the way you like.
---
True, but that assumes the person only logs in long enough for the sp. I'll stay on a bit, move a few things, chat with some friends and help on a gate camp since I'm already on but it doesn't mean I'm a fan of the blackout. I mean, it's interesting as a temporary event but eventually I'll have to pay for more ships and then where will I be? I just think the statements are very generalized here.
---
I would assume that it doesn't scale that directly. It is much easier yo justify grinding out 60-70b for a cheap titan than 100-120b for one pre-rorqs.
---
I respect this.
---
It's just a superiority complex.  
---
Don't take it personally or care too much..
---
So, basically, add a region without strategic, economic or logistics significance? We already have Stain.
---
I'll check that out, thanks!
---
If you want to do exploration all you need is a cov-op frig or a Astero.
---
What do you want mct for? You can use them as industry and/or PI alts.
---
You could have gotten all of MERs from the last three years if you just went and collected them instead of wasting time making this shit post.
---
Sure, that would be one way of going about it, the benefit of a secondary multiplier attribute is you can balance them independently.
---
Idk what industry or PI is? And dont I need multi character training to train skills on two characters at once? And alright so the best ship u can use is an astero?
---
Since ccp mentioned many times that they want more conflict in the game, then they should start to fix the current cap and sub cap meta at the same time.
---
Blinkingguy.gif
---
Why mining drone 2’s? I’m so confused
---
I live in the midwest and I swear the farmers around here haven't heard of crop rotation.  All they do is plant season after season of corn/soy beans/wheat...every year.
---
I've been reinforcing some low-power citadels in my lowsec stomping grounds, and I can't help but wonder why people run around and kill citadels in hisec (I'm new to structure bashing.) Do these people attack these citadels for profit? the citadels do drop modules, fuel (etc) but I didn't know if this was enough to become a form of income. I was wondering if anyone who knew what that is about could let me know, so I could obtain a potentially profitable form of PVP.
---
I don't see any reason to train caldari frigate 5 in my current place in the game.
---
Industry is where you build things, you can run a certain number of jobs with each toon, but they run in real time, so you set your jobs and only login to start new ones.
---
PI or PP, is planetary production, it is a way to farm resources from planets, it can be lucrative if you set it up and spend some time with it, the alts doing PI can stay wherever you want them while your main flys around exploring.
---
With multi char training you can train up all three chars on a account, but you can never fly them at the same time.
---
if it's based on the skill multiplier itself, doesn't seem like its that hard to understand.
---
I can totally understand wanting CPU Management, Power Grid Management, Warp drive Operation, Capacitor Management, and Capacitor Systems operation removed.  The other skills on the list impact some fits much more than others, but these five don't care if you're armor fit, shield fit, speed tanked or what not.  Honestly instead of removing them, I'd like to see their bonuses removed but have them be required for the same modules.  
---
Working with newer players is a constant frustration in large part because of the different fitting values for ships.  A player saying "I don't have access to that" is very different from saying, "I can use all of this, but not at the same time".  Getting pulled out of warp during a fleet warp because of your skills is just another stupid punishment for not having started earlier.  I as an FC want to be able to say "Here's a meta fit ship, if you can't use these ewar modules, here's the skill books" and then be able to expect that person to not have the game prevent them from keeping up.  The player having a weaker tank is fairly irrelevant in terms of my ability to include them in fleets, but not being able to stay with the fleet is a huge issue.  The agility skills would be an issue, but new players start off with smaller faster ships anyways so I'm not worried about those.
---
So should I have one for PI and one for industry? Then my main doing exploration with an astero, is there a certain fit I should use? And is there certain places where I should put my toon for PI?
---
I was doing just that but I got bored trying to keep up with market changes, plus I'm on holiday now. Still I managed to sell several dozen ventures at 2mil prices :P
---
Reducing injected skill points for sub cap skills kind of makes sense. I can't disagree with that at all.
---
Bots? You must be mistaken, friend. 
---
We're 110% sure that the blackout drove all botters away from EVE, with absolutely no negative side effects.
---
100% agree
---
As for the Astero, it is the ship I use the most, I fly a 130m very quick Frostline setup, but cov-op frigs have the same hacking g bonus and are half the price for the hull.
---
The big Strat is the cruiser size Astero, and it is good for catches and ghost sites, as it can survive if you screw up, I do not recommend using it as a roaming explorer though, you will get  caught.
---
Great write up dude
---
They're already quite good, issue is with price and SP requirements - it's easier to get 100 bomber pilots waiting on a bridge than 30 blops pilots usually, and with bombers you're less scared to drop on sketchy targets (because 100 bombers have total cost similar to **one** nicely fit Marshal).
---
"Yes, finally, some good fucking food." - FC Ramsay
---
What are cov op frigs? I believe I have gallente frigates maxed although idk if that's the same, so which loadout should I use and fit should I use do you think? I got money to blow and I just want to use all 3 chars and my omega time to the best of my ability.
---
Rorqual rifter,Rifter rorqual
---
 Dosen't the Rorqual have like uber drones,IJS .
---
Literally a double whammy to the supply and demand curves.
---
Idk. I’m not a rorqual pilot or even a miner. My point is even if its a sitting duck with 0 offensive capabilities it shouldnt have issues with rifters
---
The difference would be that we're talking a K-space region internally connected with gates and cynos, but as an island isolated from the rest of K-space except through a disproportionate number of K-to-K wormholes. Some consequences:
---
• NS combat without supers, as they can't fit through wormholes and there's no local sov. Nullbloc neighbours can't roflstomp the inhabitants with supers (they could still bring more bodies in smaller ships, of course, but see Simple Farmers for an example of how hard dislodging an entrenched group from NPC null can be) 
---
• Decent local NS pvp without wormholes: no titans means no subcap hotdrops, NPC null means you can live in the same system as your enemies and clash as timezones change over 
---
• Lots of WH access to null = good raiding opportunities, particularly in combination with the blackout.
---
Byeeee
---
LOL yeah, the bots also just add [faction stabs](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77944741/) to warp off.
---
That is crop rotation.
---
It‘s terrible, we can‘t rorq mine in AAM anymore because PH stages bomber fleets from HLW.  How are we supposed to build jump gates, supers and keepstars now?
---
This is meme has been worn thru like your grandmas carpet
---
Nope, pretty much everyone values content - people killing other people is what makes the EVE universe go round.
---
My point is that the better balanced an instance of content is, the more satisfying it is likely to be for all involved. Imbalanced and unwanted (by one party) fights tend to provide less satisfaction overall and can easily have a negative effect on players.
---
This isn't to say that you shouldn't be able to have imbalanced or "forced" fights, only that the development focus should be on shifting content further towards the "consentual and balanced" ends of the spectrums. 
---
If it's a choice between imbalanced and nonconsentual content or no content, the former is obviously preferable. However, CCP can and should shift their focus from facilitating and rewarding the initiation of imbalanced fights towards providing opportunities for relatively balanced battles.
---
You should but your PI toons in a safe null or WH corp, or, you can run factory only planets in HS, but you will pay upwards of 10% tax to whoever won the POCO fight in that system.
---
All 6 of my toons live in a WH where they all do PI, my two mains can huff gas perfectly, can kinda fly barges, and can scout hunt with strats and bombers.
---
My preferred Astero fit is sisters probe launcher, cloak, Frostline combo analyzer, MWD, scram, dual I-stabs, ancellery armor rep, DCU, and T2 emission scope rig. Along with a blackglass hacking and 8% warp speed implants.
---
Fly a cloaked blops, you should be fast enough to get out of decloak range once the fatass turns around properly.
---
Pirate frigates would be a good reason.
---
How is it good for small alliances with half a brain? How can you defend your sov and have a good Intel in a small alliance and safely farm? How does it benefit small alliances?
---
Aren't most of the wormhole explo sites full of sleepers? I imagine you'd have a rough time trying to do that in an exploration frigate.
---
Okay ima look for a bull or WH corp then.
---
Just wants a grieving mechanic
---
Gallente cov-op is the Helios, same as the Astero, sisters/T2 probe launcher, cloak, best scanner/combo scanner you can use, MWD, matching T2 data or relic rig, i-stabs or nanofiber. Fill the rest with scanning mods, don’t worry about tank, you die if something locks you.
---
Fair, but thats why i have it at 4.
---
Make sabre bubbles decloak anything in their radius when deployed.
---
Make a microwarpdrive that can be used while cloaked.
---
Deinjecting skills is definitely reverting people's progress in the past
---
You don't know what MAU and DAU are r am I right?
---
I think I misread your post.
---
&gt;If I'm only training racial destroyer to 5 and not carriers 1 should I still have a skill point disadvantage and not get the full 500,000 skill points?
---
I think you should have that "disadvantage". For that to not be the case, the stated goal of injectors needs to change.
---
Spend 5 minutes in rookie help or help and tell me that wouldn't be confusing, for relatively new players at least.
---
Do you know if theres any good guides or youtubers out there for up to date exploration?
---
I’m not with them anymore, but Einstein-Rosen Brigade are cool people that will give you a safe system to run PI and a great base to explore jspace and wherever Bob takes you.
---
Expect to have to be on voice if you are active and they require ESI and will pick your brain a bit to make sure you are legit.
---
Unless you for the fleet ;) anyone can be a fleet boss
---
Apologies.  I understood the slash (/) to represent the word "or" so my intent was to say that farmers around only plant corn *or* soy beans *or* wheat every year.
---
Always have a plan. CCP missed that day of school apparently.
---
Yes there are many, search YouTube, and Eve-University wiki.
---
They do. They just alternate between the corn and soybeans. With wheat tossed in the further west you go as it gets dryer.
---
Bombers.
---
&gt;solo
---
The most common structure bashes happen in wormholes because there is no asset safety (you get everything that drops), so you can get a lot of loot. You can also knock out a citadel in a wormhole in a weekend because the reinforcement timers are so short.
---
Hisec bashes are doubly not fun because it takes a minimum of 11 days in-between the first bash and the last bash. You can certainly try it. If you wanted to make money, I think it would probably go through you ransoming the structure instead of destroying and looting the modules. Also consider that it costs 100mil per week of wardec, so it will cost you 200mil just to bash it to completion, plus whatever ammo and ships that might cost you.
---
I haven't really heard of people knocking down citadels in hisec, aside from Perimeter, where there are markets worth billions of isk that nullsec alliances own. It's probably not a great idea.
---
Your mums chicken noodle soup is amazing.
---
Git gud
---
It's cheaper to buy super toons than to inject them, so this is kinda moot at this point.
---
There have been a lot fewer bots out since blackout, and better responses/fights from the GOTG guys, too. It's been good all around.
---
how about.... YOU change&gt;?
---
there is this thing called lowsec where local still works, perhaps you could try that.
---
Also bombs cost like 3 mil right?  Literally nobody is going to nolife bombing miner IIs.  No killmail and isk negative on ammo wew.
---
They limit the overall time spent isk printing yes, but for south Deklein and Tenal where we've been roaming around look at 10:00-16:00, you'll find them.
---
I believe CCP is reading what they "want" to see in the numbers and as they have done many times in the past - Use "their" interpretation of data gathered to justify what they do.
---
Simply the fact certain major groups in the game are not commenting should be data enough to show - Blackout will not go close to addressing stagnancy in Nulsec\\
---
Well, what would you be using your other character for? Also, don't forget that you won't be able to use them at the same time. I'd say do it if you find a use for it (personally, I have a rarely used freighter alt in another slot).
---
If you can't find another use for your character, you're better off focusing on 1 character.
---
Well I have the option to be able to train up to 3 no? So I was thinking of doing 1 indy, 1 PI, and my main for WH or NS exploration. I'm just not sure how to get started currently training up to use an astero.
---
&gt;mortal engines
---
I’d play that game, if it existed
---
They are too much risk for way too little reward. Why would I put 2.5 bill worth of drones on the field that can get bombed and I have to chance of saving them?
---
Yes, heavy water is very cheap.
---
Yea we’ve been picking fights around that rorq and he is clearly botting 30 procs. We have killed 5 of his freighters and about 5 fax’s and other ships trying to protect him but unfortunately they have a decent response fleet the few times we have dropped
---
The isk cost for 1 cycle of a indy core II is like 400k/5 minutes. 
---
That's like 4-5 pieces of compressed dark ochre (the worst ore in 0.0 anoms)
---
That mining amount is roughly 8000 m3 (16 m3 X 100 X 5).
---
That's roughly 35% of your yield needed to fuel the rorq, using the WORST possible ore.
---
T2 mining drones mine roughly 22,000 m3 per cycle (compared to the 45,000 m3 that excavators do).
---
They are also much faster, and less likely to die to booshers/bombers (they are much less of a target, and I just carry like 50 in my rorq now).
---
bombers hunt domis and myrms better than strats
---
In lower class wormholes you can find pirate faction sites as well as sleeper sites . This is why in my comment i said to look for the pirate faction sites. These have no sleepers in them .
---
bruh
---
Bad for NRDS too.
---
But it is not on the same level as, for example, resetting the server. Are you against salt?
---
Im not entitled to my safe zone, we built and earned our area and work to make it the way it is. Don't bitch about it
---
I am not against salt, if done properly. I would rather have cap skills reduced when killed same as T3s.
---
&gt;Best
---
Oh boy are we going to have words about this... but I have to admit, I like the touch about the face mask. Old Sebiestor character creator had something like that.
---
How do you fight them in a bomber without getting shredded by their drones or instantly neuted out?
---
career agents just teach you how to do it. They don't give you good rewards.
---
Use a Sin
---
Dual Target painters and the right rigs and they will apply super well. You shouldn't have to worry about neuts from 20km+ out
---
Okay so is it worth it for me to buy multi char training atm? Or not until I know what I will be doing with the other two?
---
fit properly
---
use damps
---
ratters have always had the advantage against solo hunters, ya already require the ratter to be retarded
---
Congrats! The only way to learn is to try. I'd rather watch your video than read all the people asking how to do stuff in here.
---
Because EVE pve is about the worst pve experience of any game.
---
Don't see why a stratios wouldn't work with a modified fit.
---
I dont care about probes, like, finding my ships isn't that hard. Please come try to kill me
---
rifters makes this way funner though lol
---
Not all crop cause the issues that crop rotation fix.
---
Some crop don't harm the soil.
---
There is no other side of the coin. What you just described there is various forms of PvP. Sitting in a crab ship 24/7 does none of this.
---
What would you do with the second character?
---
You haven't answered that yet.
---
I wanted to do industry on one character and PI on the other one so that's 2 and then exploration on my main one. Dont you have omega time for 3 chars on the same acc and with multi char training csnt u train 3 at once?
---
nothing
---
everything
---
Where's that fit?
---
Current blackout state of Detroid:  [https://zkillboard.com/kill/78054293/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78054293/)
---
each MCT only unlocks one more characters training.
---
But yes.
---
You can MCT 2 characters to get them to doing PI.
---
PI fucking sucks, but that is an option.
---
I haven't had this much fun in years.
---
Well idk what else to do with another char or to just focus on my one character and do exploration for cash since I heard it's really good, I like high risk high reward type things.
---
Really is what makes reddit terrible tbh
---
CCP Falcon must be feeling home sick, 
---
" 14:15 - **Falcon**: Eve if up to me, would be a very harsh dark dystopian place where bad stuff happens, eve should be an absolute hellscape of terribleness."
---
 He wants to make Eve like Newcastle, FTM (Smiley-Face) o7
---
Damn. Imagine having this much of a persecution complex
---
4 characters and you cant make scrip come on man there are lots of ways to make money other than if you are running 3 hulks and a roriqual for boost, i can understand why you are upset. but m3 per hour is not the only way. watching Intel and making money might not be so great now under the super umbrella as a before but you have to find another way. local was a plague because of bots and they were taxing you because everything you could do they could do 23.75 hours a day and that was a tax on you and everything you build by lowering prices that you could sell what you made for. it might take a while to balance out but unless they are making real money i cant see them botting to a level that they were before.  
---
your risk will become worth it when prices rise as inventory dries up for the risk you take. 
---
start building hulks
---
Safer than highsec because you could see stuff coming on intel from 5 systems away and everyone in local was either blue or hostile, there were no unknown quantities to worry about. If you could afk your VNIs whilst watching netflix waiting for an alert (or more likely afk them whilst carrier ratting on a main) then you have to consider the space fairly safe.
---
Even as a small group in wormholes you can be incredibly safe unless you're using bastion/siege because you're scanning for new holes opening whilst doing your sites. 
---
The most fun PvE I had in null was running 10/10 escalations in hostile space that no-one else wanted to take. 
---
And yes groups have built up tools over the years and *won* nullsec, that's why it's absolutely stagnant and too safe.
---
Not an Epic game move. No bottom text at all.
---
The only difference i noticed was local doesnt work anymore.
---
The only three I think should be removed are;
---
* `CPU Management`
---
* `Power Grid Management`
---
* `Mechanics`
---
The first two -- fitting skills -- synergise way too much with all the `x Upgrades` skills. Those skills could be removed instead, but I think it takes too much nuance away from ship fitting. The `x Upgrades` skills aren't part of the The Magic 14, so training `Shield Upgrades` is a dumb idea if you fly nothing but armour, but it's perfectly smart if you fly Merlins or something.
---
`Mechanics` is for hull tanking, and gating-off the `Assault Frigates` skill. An extra 5% hull will rarely save a newbie. It's a pointless train. 
---
I wouldn't be upset if the next two skills went away, but I don't think it's entirely necessary;
---
* `Capacitor Management`
---
* `Capacitor Systems Operation`
---
Training both to V from their starting skills will give a ship +35% better cap regen. When you couple that will skills like `Controlled Bursts`, `Afterburner`, or `Shield Compensation` (or any other cap-reducing skill), the cap stability of a ship scales out nicely. The only cap-reducing skill in The Magic 14 is `Warp Drive Operation`. People have to choose between improving the cap of every module, or improving specific modules *more*. Seems like a meaningful choice to me.  
---
My real bugbear is `Shield Management` and `Shield Operation`. Training those to V from starting levels gives between +59% (or +52% for Caldari) better shield regen. I kinda' feel like this gives a high SP pilot an easy advantage over a low SP pilot without having to put thought or effort into manual piloting. This really only applies to solo/small gang though, so YMMV. 
---
v0v
---
What really give me the shits in `Advanced Spaceship Command`. There is no module or ship that benefits from the skill, but doesn't have it as a level V pre-req.
---
You only need killmails if you're trying to prove you're a leet PvPer when you're not
---
Ha.
---
Hahahahah.
---
Haha.
---
Wew.
---
I guess, most of ratters switch their VNI to Ishtars. And, of course, any solo hunters, exclude t3 cruiser, cannot do anything, because speed of berserks on Ishtar with dron navigation computer in most of cases bigger than frig speed on mvd.
---
Shake you say? I have a special EVE PvP emergency kit in my office with an anti-perspirant deo as main component. It also contains talcum powder for moist hands, a packed bowl for immediate heart rate reduction and a 6pack in the mini fridge... just in case.
---
EvEn PlAnTs lIke MiÑeRaL$
---
Don’t forget my sweet smelling boy alfalfa.
---
Was there some retarded John Oliver or NPR segment on soil erosion recently? Suddenly people are convinced nobody rotates crops and we’re due a nationwide dust bowl.
---
Proteus if you have the balls
---
Pros: a little bit more scram range, interdiction nullified, can fit combat probes and faster warp speed
---
Cons: 2 less mid slots, wayyyyy worse agility, bit more expensive, and of course, good old skillpoint loss
---
Instead of trying do do everything solo, find a good group of people that are active in your timezone and hop on comms regularly.  You will be hooked forever.
---
Can I have your skill points?
---
Jokes on you guys... heh... I was merely *pretending* to be retarded.
---
Vni was broken af, it got an insane ROI. You covered your costs after just 2h. For t5 abyssals its about 17h, carrier like 12h, super 45h, rorqual 45h
---
Same. It would incentivize older players to max out some lower level skills through ISK or PLEX rather than wanting to spend the training time on that one racial ship or certain skills CCP added to the game later after vets had already trained past them. Take Mining Frigates for example. I can fly max level Hulks. Until 2 months ago, I couldn't fly a Venture. Why? Because who the hell needs to bother with a Venture when you can fly Hulks and Rorqs?
---
Because null bears want you to feel guilty (like you do now) and have chance to make you become one of them.
---
What they can get: a pilot to make them look strong and another taxable people to feed their wallet
---
What they need to do: KEYBOARD WARRIOR FTW
---
This game are Foxhole do logistics really well.
---
Oh let's victimise someone because they dont like pvp.  You guys should be ashamed of yourselves
---
Ooh! I never thought of the recon angle!
---
This.
---
Becauae most small alliances arent turbo krabs so like to hunt and have some challenges. So the extra pvp, roaming gangs, and general content has been fun. Also have good intel by having an intel channel and using comms aka half a brain
---
I'm familiar with the skills required to daytrip wormholes, but i've never been an actual resident. I don't think i'd really be capable of rolling and hole control and stuff like that. I'm tripleboxing, too, so I can't really deal with an active defense. Are there any low power or unmanned citadels left in wormhole space? maybe in lower levels like c1s and c2s?
---
I don't know about you guys but I am actually enjoying PvP'ing in my Rorq.... 4 killmarks and counting.
---
uwu
---
I wouldn't remove them, but maybe bump down the training time by 1 or something (ie. x6 training time becomes x5, and so on) just to reduce the wall it feels like you get thrown against when creating a character.
---
lol... highsec isn't safe. Let's not pretend that concord actively prevents pvp, but rather actively respond to pvp that has already finished.
---
its stainguy chillout lol
---
Am I like the only one that's ever rolled a sebo'd lachesis when the fleet knows bombers are around?
---
Light drones will destroy a rifter so easily
---
I did cancel my subs. I also did the math and This July has 1000 less kills on average so far compare to the last 2 Julys.  So much "vibrancy".
---
I only disagree with the second part because that’s part of the decision in armor vs shield
---
Guess you'll have to adapt like everyone else. So far what I've seen is that this is a great change and I hope it, or something like it, stays.
---
I think you miss the point, a lot have. I can make isk currently. It just takes far longer for me to do so. And really were I am it is not any more dangerous than before. Just more TIME consuming. I am more of a hunter than a pve person, most of my isk comes from market speculation and PI. occasionally from Mining. Also you will find that as more people Leave game, go to high sec, move to umbrellas, your targets will dry up. and CCP will be making less money long term. Just saying
---
For someone not sure if they can kill ishtars/domi/myrm solo, the solution is not to jump to using a 2b+ ship and alt.
---
Drone prot is shit, and the worst T3.
---
What decision? Armor can't self rep for as much, gets slower and gives up damage output. What does shield get? Slightly lower overall resists and more sig.
---
and rob them once your alt get higher position in said corp
---
Then the Myrm mjd's out. He said solo, which would be tough in a bomber.
---
Jokes aside, Living in nul is  not safe. The threat is ever present and unrelenting  24/7. It takes a lot of player participation to try and keep players safe from the constant threat of small/large roaming fleets. Providing an umbrella takes a lot of commitment, work, organisation and more importantly time from RL to  build and maintain. The risk is very real with or without the blackout. 
---
I'm all for losing asset safety, use it, move it or lose it. Is how it should be.
---
 EVE is meant to be the apex of true sandbox games. CCP can't keep taking away the sand and changing it, because they don't like how we play. If they do that, it will spoil what sets this game apart from the rest.
---
God my graphics card sucks
---
Don't tell mister blops truck that somebody somewhere would eventually realize he's farming "content" and blap him in a corm or something. Or God forbid catch him in a bubble.
---
The long point is useful sometimes, but considering hes worried about MJD'ers it wont do much to help with that. NOS doesn't leave you with a way to shut off a ratter's tank, and even with a max DPS fit Im not sure you'll break a domi tank before getting beat up pretty bad.
---
I'm comparing it with a Stratios
---
And secondly, good luck catch anything with mjd in a loki
---
Single client or multi-boxing?
---
It isn't always required but gives you a lot of flexibility. Can orbit outside his web range while you kill drones, then if he spools his MJD you heat the faction point and burn in, then return to longer orbit. That's just one scenario. 
---
Your drones should be hitting their resist hole, they'll break eventually. You don't need much cap after you've killed their drones.
---
The Proteus is still worse than a Stratios, especially if you want to factor in price/sp loss
---
Sorry - should have included that. Running two clients - hence the decision to have 2 x monitors vs ultra wide.
---
Noticed a lot of issues like this over the past few week. I just hope they are visual glichs and nothing is wrong with the real maths.
---
You're right, they should use a Marshal.
---
The performance is comparable depends on how much you value interdiction nullification
---
But if you want definite effectiveness/isk, stratios is probably the better choice, especially if you have a ceptor alt for scouting
---
Yeah, I agree there's definitely a scenario for it. Domis are actually pretty spooky especially neut fit vs solo. 375m3 of drones is aot to chew through too
---
Can I have your stuff.
---
Exactly. The lack of experience needs to be compensated for with ISK, as is tradition.
---
I suppose so. It's just the last thing I'd ever use to try and fight a BS fit with many more drones and neuts
---
People should care why?
---
But without scram you cannot catch a ratting BS
---
So that's the dilemma
---
The social aspect is what keeps making me want to come back, but I got wayyyy too obsessed and ended up just spending half the day on eve
---
It's really the neuts that make it an issue to fight. Killing a ratting BS isnt nearly as hard if youre not going to be capped quickly
---
The VNI nerf is having a devastating impact on badposting in /r/Eve
---
One of the best assholes I've ever had the privilege to know.
---
kinda like test post-fountain amirite?
---
how cute, you are postinjg
---
It was the fastest way to make lowsec more active.
---
It’s domis or myrms, Ishtar is too expensive for most cases
---
Spoken like a pvper that doesn't understand why their industry players keep dying. But at least you can still find and kill ratting vexors without getting capitals dropped on you.
---
app'd
---
People keep ganking the excavators.
---
&gt;The eve ecosystem has to contribute to me
---
no problem at all with wanting to build shit, but why do you expect it handed to you?
---
They tend to whine a lot.
---
You can’t, not solo. Bombers are good in groups, but if you are getting close enough for tackle there’s literally nothing you can do against a proper fit dominix. You’ll get neuted dry at 20km, shredded by heavy drones after your prop mod turns off, and even if you can kite out of neut range, he’ll just MJD. 
---
Basically, make some friends (or alts), and fit a cyno
---
Probably another Bergmann recruiting effort.
---
unban me you pussy
---
nothing wrong with wanting to hisec pve at all. the reason the guy in op was leaving was because his 98% safe way of doing things has been slightly nerfed (near2 can still scrape intel im p sure)  
---
  
---
the only douchebag is the terminal spodbrain trying to leverage some pathetic financial contribution to a multi million dollar game development company because they dont give a fuck about his entitlement. its literally the same thing as going into a mcdonalds and saying "if u dont reduce the price of the double cheeseburger back to a dollar i'm fucking never eating here again, i've been coming here for 20 years!!!!" hopefully he just fucks off forever, just like everyone else who has that mentality.

help police ive been victimized on reddit by some fellows that laughed at me
---
Allowing supers to warp to anomalies was the biggest mistake CCP ever made.
---
CCP listening to vocal small groups who want their style of play to be the preeminent style. Screw everybody else, as we change the styler of play to suit 2% of eve players. Some things need to be changed, and this is great but there were other ways to this more effectively. Will be joining colleagues and joining the unsub  group that will continue grow as they are truly screwing this game. No matter how you try to make people log in to boost numbers, to try and drive an image of eve is not dying, people can see through that shit.
---
God forbid you have any risk.
---
Glad you find it funny..
---
I feel you, I usually hunt for pirates and wh'ers so for me this is like Christmas.it sucks that the bait is leaving the game but it was pretty safe for far too long. glad to see them change something that shakes things up and keeps the soul of what is eve alive. sometimes it is not about money, i just hope that those of us keeping the lights on can be here to light the path if the general population ever finds us. a dystopian hellscape  is not the hello kitty world that most people want to play in but the people i find in the void tend to be the kind of people i want to enjoy it with. o7 good luck out there.
---
Watched the video and its nice man, if you ever want to do some small gang bombing with me let me know.  Always cool to hang out with laid back people.
---
You might be in the wrong corp if this is true.
---
High sec bumpers would be happy regardless, because they would just figure out how to get afk haulers Concorded.
---
Absolutely.  Fought real good PvP people...they knew it.  I knew it.  A good time was had by all.  
---
I have also had random dudes set up bad bomb runs on my drones.  They may have thought they were pretty neat...but the truth was there for all to see. :-)
---
It’s basically an unlimited length free trial. If you play long term you’ll want to have omega, but it allows you to try the game without spending anything and you can do quite a bit without it.
---
I'd say its personal preference. There are benefits to ultra wide (or the newer ultra-ultra wide as well as two separate monitors.
---
It also depends on what you'll be doing in game. Mining requires far less space than ratting or pvp for example.
---
People who fit nanofibers and fly kiting ships are the PvP definition of risk averse, and you'll notice that there's a lot of them out there.
---
"But if I fit scram and brawl (like a man), they light a cyno!" the 'elite pvper' says.
---
Well yeah. That's what a risk is.
---
Killing a human player's ratting VNI (pre-dronebay cut) with a beam Retribution for example is similarly as risk-averse as the guy flying the ratting Thanatos with a cyno. But you'll notice the people complaining about the Thanatos lighting a cyno on them aren't exactly eager to see their beam Retributions less able to gank the VNI.
---
I'm not necessarily on either side here, my point is that /u/Xibyr is absolutely correct in his claim.
---
And PvPers don't? This is Reddit we're talking about.
---
If you can earn $100k with your level of intelligence I’d like to move to where you’re living.
---
Mostly salt base flavored shakes.
---
Probably 50/50 in terms of mining and ratting. 
---
Thinking minimum 100 hertz and less than 5ms response. Can get that in the UWs at the moment.
---
I had this guy telling me the other day, "miners rise DOWN." I tried explaning his obvious misspeak, but he wouldn't listen, he kep on oppressing miners. God, it pissed me off. I don't know whether the dude was trolling, but if he was that 's some adept levels of trolling mastery, because it FUCKING TILTED ME. I eventually snapped and started yelling at the moron, he deserved it really but I'm the one who got kicked from the mumble. Seriously? Imbecile was oppressing us miners and I get banned? Fuck dude.
---
This is going to depend a LOT on the specific corp you want to join. For some, having been part of the 'enemy' recently is a non-negotiable red flag, while others will take into account how you communicate with them, the things you do in game etc. Just depends on how risk adverse they are.
---
Spoken like someone not in a small null alliance. We dont have any pure indy people. Also have personally lost ratting ships during blackout already. It could use tweaks but enjoying it.
---
Hows the koolaid?
---
&gt; Just better Intel than no Intel.
---
CCP Agreed, you have a directional scanner.
---
I know because post, but this should be a hic script
---
Id go for the bump moduals
---
Interupt a mjfg
---
Well then it doesn't sound like it's your concern anymore. 
---
Forgive me for not automatically throwing support behind your "math". For starters, you don't have access to every registered kill in the game. At best you have access to zkill, which only pulls kills from those who have authorized it to scrape their data. Care to indulge us on your methods for determining the claims you made along with something to prove you're not just making up shit?
---
You were not cut out for it.
---
So if a corp is reluctant to recruit former Goons, would Karmafleet be less of a red flag than Goonwaffe?
---
Sorry, our HOA kind of has standards
---
News flash, I'd rather fight people shooting back. AFK VNI's are only 1 step down from smart bombing pods in lowsec for KDR.
---
My 2 cents as a player who just returned a year ago. I play in NPC null and I am not part of a Sov holding block. I do not mind Blackout with one exception. I'm tired of  ratting or mining for a few hours in a ship some cruiser hiding off dscan can't kill easy and without risk and then the second I decide to move PI it another popped hauler. SO in my view I personally don't mind delayed local but make it delayed not totally unusable. I know HTFU and all but if they really wanted PVP they would at least take some risks as well. As it is I'm about ready to just go to Sov Null and get a Super and be done with it.
---
Hold up, what?
---
In 2010, I think, I first tried Eve. When I was doing the shitty tutorial stuff I had a GM convo me to see if I had any questions or needed help. It was pretty cool.
---
HS actually has good moon mining. There is a group I've been mining with recently, and the moon belts have 5-6m m3 of +15% arkanor, gneiss, spodumain etc (depending on the moon). It's a little nuts how little difference there is in the mining profitability between HS and null now, espescially with how much lower risk HS is.
---
Sounds like fun. 
---
I have more respect for people that actually undock and try to do something than those that try to rationalize not doing anything.
---
It's way more shrill. You can generally tell a PvPer to HTFU and they'll understand.
---
Or or or... We could strap them all together and call it a "warp drive"!
---
Good Job man
---
As a SP farmer, i can guarantee that we only farm the login SP.
---
No, i am not going to undock one pilot for 3 mins to farm 10k SP. Not goind to do it 600 times per day.
---
Cargo fit sunesis can hold a bit more than 2600m3
---
All activities lead to PVP. Even the isk you make from bounties and spend on whatever you are engaging in some small way in PVP against another player interested in having those same resources.
---
People have been using cloaky ships to blow up excavators, which are a bit expensive. T2 mining drones are super cheap, and may cost even less than the ammo used on them. 
---
The t2s cost less and a rorq can have a ton of them. A hunter can kill them easily, but they risk being jumped on themselves going for such a shit target.
---
So there just sacrificeing island per hour to save there drones
---
OK not to be an ass but BS. If I'm "crabbing" I'm still doing a form of PVP. Mining I'm racing to get my mins/ores to Market before someone else at a better price if they are slower than me. Or I'm trying to build more faster to sell more faster than the next guy. If I'm ratting I'm trying to beat the other guy to the sites to make more isk maybe to buy a better ship for PVP or to Improve the MODS on a ship so it doesn't get blown up faster than the other guys.
---
 Its a different kind of PVP but its still PVP.
---
This is why everyone hates weebs, they always need to drag everything down to their level.

I'm going to address the second paragraph. I generally talk to my killers. Usually its a comment like good kill to bad I was empty this time or Ive been dodging you guys for weeks finally caught me and most of the ones I see on the regular are cool people. However there is another group of PVP "leet" out there the ones that see you out it a ship for hours and won't even attempt it because its a risk but the second you drop ship to an easy kill they uncloak or warp to you in a ship that can't be scanned and pop you no good fight or friendly banter. Those are the ones that annoy me because they aren't looking for PVP just free and easy ganks and salt if you give it to them.
---
lmao
---
IMO, high-sec SHOULD be safer... at least the consequences for 'illegal' aggression should be FAR higher, with the rewards lower concord protecting the loot perhaps which should reduce the amount of ganking.
---
Pretty much. Like others have said, they'll still outmine/outindie any other corp. Goons don't have to completely optimize everything right now. They just have to outmine everyone else. And the blackout has been helping them. I'm sure the recruiting officers for the big blocs have gotten a considerable boost in apps now that being a renter is pretty much a thing of the past.
---
Is that like, 150 man fleets?
---
ganking is fine
---
No I am not
---
Its fine if it takes a lot of effort and manpower to build up. Its just lame if its given out for free. Although I think with how eve is going, they do need content for everyone.
---
Ty for the explanation. This makes sense and helps a lot.
---
Shame shame shame
---
And more profitable.
---
OH YES HEL-CLASS ABYSSAL GO!
---
I don’t really know? I haven’t played eve in years.
---
Still relevant :D
---
You're in TEST not Jimmy Dean's Spaceship Crew of Friends That Play On Weekends. Light a cyno and all that liquid ozone magically transforms into angry nerds ready to defend you.

---
PVE, industry lazy players have been buffed time and time again over the last decade. Your cloaking idea is again one born out of laziness.
---
Damn your box is small. Let me help you think outside. Nano ships let you fight and survive against groups bigger than you.  That's the why most smaller, higher skilled groups fly them. True nano ships are fast, but are paper thin. It makes eve more than just a math problem. If you know so little about how pvp works that you can't figure out how to counter nano ships, I feel sorry for you. Enjoy your stratops.
---
People like to be dicks on the internet.  There's a safety from being anonymous.   Everybody has internet muscles for flexing.  In a sandbox game, people get pissed when they don't get to do what they want.  PVE likes to mine, build, mission run.  PVP likes to get kill stuff and get killboard stats.  When they don't get what they want, they make louder noise because of the anonymous safety.
---
Pretty much this.  
---
Because....Eve.  Pretty much every conversation about Eve  on the forums or Reddit degenerates into 30-50 year olds acting like high school kids chest beating and dick waving and not actually trying to understand that lots of people play the game, and almost none of them are looking for the same thing.
---
&gt;You can learn more about economics on one year playing this than in the most part of the college hours in economics subjects
---
Wait you actually believe this?
---
Id like to see the rorqual be an absolute beast at boosting... It already kind of is, but I want fleet support to be it's primary roll, still have it be decent enough at mining to be worth a player actually flying... But imo the rorqual as is makes the rest of the ore ship stack irrelevant.... Best producer, best booster, best capacity, best tank, why ever bother undocking an orca or hulk outside high sec?
---
I like PvP in FW but first I need funds for pvp ships and this is when BO become wrong. The fits at least for capture novice  sites cost about 12m isk, I know that many corps have free fit for FW and they also have fleets. However, I have to run FW solo because no corps allow me to set my alts in another NS corps for farming while main account on LS FW. And NS before BO have no slots for frig-frig pvp like FW. Everyone fly T3C and supercapitals that require months of skill learning. My NS is small corp rent 2 systems and we are in big troubles, not only lack of manpower to maintain two systems but also landlords looks like BO make them abandon their renting lands for another alliances to do whatever they want. This is a disaster for the one who try to maintain my omega with ded and funds for FW
---
Did I miss the part where you cant make isk right now?
---
This is why I PVP, this kind of salt is just too golden.
---
But we'll still have bananas.
---
Don't need bees for bananas.
---
Can confirm. Have lost Astero to rocket bomber.
---
no
---
high sec is not a no pvp zone. Ever heard of suicide ganking and wardecs?
---
Yes its still very possible to solo hunt ratters. You can use a battlecruiser of your own - a myrmidon, brutix, or hurricane work fine against them.
---
Fighting a domi you can go about it one of two ways - use a bombing bomber and finish them off with torps (hounds work exceptionally well due to an explosive dmg bonus), or you can use a decently tanked battlecruiser to break them. Canes and drakes work well due to not needing capacitor to fire guns, having selective damage, and being able to tank real well. Use your small drones to kill off a few heavies and suddenly yoi have a lot of staying power.
---
that is a good question. I don't know. Thanks to ccp i don't play mmos anymore. Eve online was the only mmo i ever played. I quit WOW after 13 hours because i couldn't progress alone anymore like in diablo 2. That was in 2006/07. Never tried wow since then again.
---
It's more the 24-7 VNI stuff that has stopped. The MER in Fade is going to be roughly zero, and Dek should be way down. The ratting (and botting) is more contained to CN/AUTZ.
---
&gt;Did you have Concord to protect you from everything except wardecs?
---
[:Thinking:](https://zkillboard.com/system/30002768/page/3/) 
---
Concord didn't protect those freighters that died.
---
well then it is a good thing i'm leaving isn't it?
---
Oh yes I'll be sure to tackle a 3kms Orthrus using a Rupture, or better yet with a Stiletto against RLML, neut in the utility high, and light drones. But when I bring a Lachesis to force them to engage closer, suddenly local is full of moaning about my ship choice.
---
Funny how you assume that because I argue against nano that I must be in a bloc. I'm independent, I haven't gone on a stratop in a long time. I also think that everyone and their mom flying kiting ships for pvp and complaining when people don't feed them free kills and decide to disengage instead is just as bullshit as when the tankless hulk gets ganked by two catalysts in 0.5 and complains concord should be preventative. Both instances involve a person who has no earthly idea how video game interactions work, complaining they aren't fed the exact experience they want.
---
I'm not arguing against the concept of PvP. Not even the slightest. But bruh, "Nano ships let you fight and survive against groups bigger than you" is just shorthand for "nano ships are less risk to fly than ships with scramweb".
---
This is actually a really good idea!
---
Ccp, please hire this guy!
---
Don't you have to touch them every month for this to work?
---
It's not exiting. Just my body reacts funny. My mind is so bored that i rather watch grass grow.
---
no that looks even more boring than eve online. I hate work. Eve online is work. Farming simulator is work. I want fun.
---
Ahhh no i wanted you to know and thanks to this post i know you know now.
---
What makes this game so special? Why does it exist for 16 years? I don't get it. And i played for 5 years.
---
If a threat comes into your system in Nullsec, you can go shoot it away before it can bother you.
---
Not quite so simple in highsec.
---
pretty good. To read the response to my salt is more enterraining than 5 years of eve online.
---
Have you tried using a dominix? I hear they have excellent DPS, the ability to stay and fight back, and with insurance cost less to lose than the old VNI........
---
Perhaps if you actually took such a ship out into hostile space and tried to get fights yourself, you'd realize there's a lot more nuance to the subject than you originally thought.
---
Attempting to speak in absolutes when you've only experienced one side of the coin just makes you look incredibly stupid.
---
only if the game goes back to the state it was in before the drifter attacked and the blackout started. Oh and the vni can launch 5 heavy drones again.
---
I do actually take ships into hostile space and try to get fights. I kill, I die, I fight. I don't complain when I'm dropped or blobbed, I suck it up and go get my replacement ship.
---
Your assumption is just as stupid.
---
Would be better without the anime shit.
---
I recommend it. You get a basic sense of the game. I started playing a year ago after a decade of wanting to play it. I started mining and made isk slowly but surely. I bought one of the bundles that went on sale. It had subscription time on it. Then I had heard of aomething called ratting. Decided that was a better way and skilled into a Prophecy. After making ok isk, I got a drop from one of the sentient rats in a drone anom. It was an implant that sold for 300mil isk. Heart sweaty with moms spaghetti, I flew to Amarr to sell. I was sure someone would shoot me down but nope. 
---
Then I started looking into nullsec and joined a newbro corp. The second day I joined, one of the recruiters told me there would be a fleet going out to kill something big. I started saying I can't fly the ships they needed and he instantly gave me 10 fully tackle fit atrons. We blew up a fort. I was hooked.
---
Id rather they buff your mining barge to be a threat.  Its supposed to be operating in deep dark dangerous space, who the fuck sends a truck out there that can't defend itself.
---
Also if local is gone some kind of "once every 4 hours or so pulse" that decloaks people isnt out of the realm of reasonable, non afk people will be just fine, afk campers get fucked.  
---
Supers aren't any safer btw, they die as well, your best offense is still coordinating with a few friends.  Whatever you use at that point will be safer.
---
no u
---
Your body reacts with the sympathetic nervous system...which is excitement.
---
the ones poorly fitted that aren't able to get on com, light a cyno,have the correct fit, have the cyno inhib on their overview deserve to die
---
Dynamic DED sites. The enemies and rewards inside are based on what you are warping in with instead of a fixed table.
---
Also, make the sites, particularly the lower tier ones more interesting than "destroy 500 frigates and move on".
---
Why do airheads like this even think we care why they’re leaving, just feck off and let us continue having a blast.
---
If you have people earring in Titans, they should be ready to counter drop anyone that comes in the area.
---
Somewhat ironically, your post itself is a great example of why there's such a divide between PvE and PvP players in EVE.
---
Just as many PvP players hate on PvE players without understanding why they might find it enjoyable, many PvE players (such as yourself) do the same, claiming 'PvP players just want to pick on people, they just want one-sided 'fights' so they can feel better about themselves'.  While this could possibly be true in some crazy edge cases within the hisec wardeccer or chronic gatecamper communities, making those kind of grandiose pseudo-psychological statements only serves to increase the divide the OP is describing.
---
14 years...shakes, (music volume lowered quickly), mess up overheat or leave mwd on at 0km, ohshit cyno rapier...every fight I get in, other than bot killing, has a different element.
---
You know that will get detected and fucked quite fast right?
---
It is incredibly easy to tank your ship and make it ungankable.
---
Unless you are in a freighter or Orca, it's easy to MWD out of range of blaster ganks.
---
Tornado ganks do roughly 10k EHP per Tornado @ around 100mil per T2 fit nado. All you have to do to make yourself unprofitable to gank is have less than 200m in droppable loot for every 10,000 EHP.
---
And get stucked there for years because you underestimate the locals...
---
-make structures that can keep a wormhole open permanently, allowing for scalability
---
-allow cynos into said wormholes
---
-no aggressor timers for jumping in null
---
-no local at all in game
---
-all structures can decay if not used
---
-titans can't dock anywhere
---
-fortz can move within their systems by warping, but can never be packed up once put down
---
You can shoot every war target that comes into high sec. Fitting your ship to be not suicide gankable is trivially easy.
---
This thread is asking how small alliances are handling it. I would take the opinion of someone with an unspoken tag over someone who likely a goon or tapi. 
---
As a small gang roamer myself I have absolutely loved this blackout. It has provided 5x the content per hour than prior to blackout.
---
Do it, that will be so fun to travel through the galaxy every week to defend them
---
wew lad
---
Could you name a few examples of these type of people you're describing?
---
Could you link your killboard then please?
---
Well you will show to everyone in the next mer if you are not impacted
---
“This game sucks now that I have to play it”
---
Man are you telling to a goons to take a little bit or risk? You have faith in them
---
&gt; Strange, if null is so dead now, why aren't they out mining and ratting?
---
Well, they aren't.

Everyone with caps has retreated to umbrella range, everyone without a cap has stopped ratting.

Guess what, being close to 10times bigger than a lot of other groups translate in bigger income, shocking
---
You know that by having cloked alt on gates, proper intel, and choosibg the size of the rock you go you can avoid to loose escavator or is it too complicated for you to do/understand, oh it's not afk, sorry for asking too much...
---
&gt;and pvp is so boring in this game.
---
Wait...what part of the game isn't boring then?
---
same bro I maxed gallente frigs and minmatar, don't really care for the rest
---
That’s a lie.
---
I'd rather they make PI goods tiny so you can fit a weeks worth of PI in like 150 M3 (too big for ceptors), but the export process from POCO to can in space takes a while so you have to stay at the Poco. Grab your PI loot in a T3C or a Battlecruiser or whatever.
---
Probably more cost effective to create a second account alt with your referral link. Then your alt gets 775k SP. You can also grab that $5 DLC once per account for another 1mil SP. I did MCT before I thought to create a second account with referral and regret it, MCT seems overpriced.
---
Well just remove rorquals
---
Trust me, it was not just PL who went anywhere extremely fast thanks to Wormholes and hyperdunked people.
---
Ugh I'm just lost idk what to do with my account I have all this money and I'm just training what I think I should be training which is the requirements to fly an astero so I can do exploration since I heard it's the best for it.
---
Check your PMs. I prefer to keep my Reddit and Eve identities separate when possible.
---
I'm sure the tiananmen square victim family are really happy that you use this name to laugh....
---
Honestly I think amarr frigates are in an amazing place right now.
---
There's a gigantic fucking difference between 'risking something' and 'taking on the maximum amount of risk possible (to the point where you're basically just committing suicide)', the latter being more or less what someone is doing when they roam in a solo brawling ship that can't easily disengage.
---
Regardless of the narrative you're trying to push, kiting does come with significant risks.  There's the obvious risk that you get caught, either by messing up or by being outplayed.  This happens regularly, even to very strong pilots.  There's also the risk that the small amount of tank you can fit is overwhelmed by captial ships or ships with strong projection.  
---
These risks have only increased over time, as caps have become more prominent in the meta, and ships like the Jaguar have been buffed.
---
Look, I've been on both sides of this fight: as the interceptor pilot catching kiting ships for the null blob I was a part of, and as the solo/small gang pilot trying to isolate and kill something while outnumbered 10 to 1.  There is a hell of a lot of give and take in these situations, and whenever I hear people speak in absolutes on the subject - as you are in this thread - it's obvious they simply have no clue what they're talking about.
---
Fair enough, I respect that.
---
Astero is great for exploration. I've made close to a billion in the last two weeks doing just that in an Astero in my spare time. 1-2 hrs a night. A decent fit will run you 80mil+. You can try the Heron instead for a cheaper fit to see if you like the exploration gameplay.
---
I mean, for things like CPU management and Power Grid management, if you don't have them at 5 you don't have a "ship".
---
Other fitting skills are the difference between being able to fit Tech 2 or downgrading certain parts to "compact" meta, not having CPU management 5 or Power Grid management 5 can mean things like "not being able to fit a properly sized shield extender at all", "can't fit a MWD at all". Cap Management/capacitor operations 5 can affect this to a lesser degree, where you have cases where a new player completely caps themselves just running hardeners, or running out out before the MWD even has time to accelerate them to full speed.
---
At the very least, CPU management, Power Grid Management, Capacitor Management, and Capacitor Operations should be made baseline.
---
That doesn't sound like pvp, that sounds like ganking.
---
You don’t have any hope for the new structures?
---
I was trying to find a guide or what modules to put on an astero but couldnt find any, yeah money is not an issue atm got about 5billion ISK I just lack the drive I guess to get out there and do something like my character is just docked in jita training skills, I'll have the ability to fly an astero by tomorrow night.
---
Eve is a sandbox bro, you do you.
---
Calm down miner
---
Uh... because it's Bergmann Empire. How have you not heard of them? Best recruitment ads.
---
&gt; overwhelmed by captial ships
---
This is the part that I am in complete agreement with the pvpers on, including the nano pilots. Capital ship application against subcaps is nonsensical and busted beyond belief. The consequence of that is that people who don't fly capitals tend to sit and watch their opponents MWDing as far away as possible taking potshots and complaining a fight isn't happening.
---
I'll be the first to admit this evidence is anecdotal. I'm not in a bloc. I don't drop caps on roamers, and I'm also occasionally that guy who roams in solo brawling ships. I do lots of silly PvP stuff, because I find it fun and my killboard isn't tied to my self-worth as a human being. It means my experience is less common than most players, but so what?
---
And if I die, I don't make a fuss about it on Reddit, I get in my replacement ship and look forward to the next fight.
---
Ogres have layers donkey!
---
yea but
---
E N Y O
---
we'll just keep alts in supers
---
Well you should find a corp somewhere maybe in wh and have some fun , playibg eve solo is boring
---
?
---
Yea but change it up, put lots of cap on your strat and you can kill domis, stupid ones might eve. neut themselves out, one did this to me the other day when I only had him long pointed and couldn’t MJD it seems..
---
Other suggestions of ships from me would be ham/drone legion, AC or ham loki, or one of the trig cruisers. Tengu can actually fit in here nicely, doing a little less damage but less stress of the survival side of things. A Gila does very nice but you’re unlikely to catch anything without eyes on the target before you jump in (so not solo). Maybe an arazu if they have a bit NPC spawn on them when you strike. 
---
The only frigs I could see having a chance is a tricked out Cruor or maybe a damavik, but your timing of modules and killing of drones would have to be spot on.
---
Eve University is a good place to start. They have a very in depth wiki and many ship pages include basic starter fittings. Beyond that, if you join a corp they'll likely be able to help you with fittings. [Astero](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Astero) and [Astero fittings](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Astero/Fittings)
---
As far as drive, EVE is what you make it. Me, I do exploration, ratting, and industry stuff, and enjoy it. But those are all a means to an end of solo or small gang PvP.
---
you know what would have protected him? fitting a bulkhead because the cargo did not require 3 expanders.
---
preset scrap piles as navigation points for drones for 100% tracking
---
Why do some people bot realize that not mining is seen as problem. The way the Rorqual works is.
---
This is a violation of the New Halaima Code of Conduct. Let us honor the sacrifices (mostly of ships, but  occasionally of other things) made by the brave allegiants and defenders of the Code. Praise James.
---
There might be one and it might add nteresting tactical options, but CCP hasn't said anything about them so I don't think they'll be implemented any time soon.
---
thats the point - if there's nobody out in nullsec, why aren't they out mining and ratting? should be safe dude
---
That space is safe, through PVP....  Its completely different then a noob system where ganking isn't allowed.
---
They aren't allowed to think, smile, or laugh about it at all. It is a crime against humanity and it should be remembered as such. Any individual against spreading the news about this is uneducated or a cruel human being.
---
Tbh my main goal is to do PvP but I want to make alot of cash so I can have the flashiest and fanciest ships and just have a blast. I want to do WH &amp; NS content but need to join a corp for that.
---
why are bombs so expensive in delve? /s
---
What? Next locust is in Tribute? fuuuuck that dude
---
Yeah, I think both your experience and resulting mentality are not held by very many people.  Not that it makes them incorrect, by any means, just that it's quite difficult to understand your perspective.
---
I can't speak for everyone, but most solo and small gang pilots I know - the players that most often fly nano - are looking to pit themselves against other players in a competitive sense.  Being able to avoid situations where you die without being able to test your skills against others is paramount, and so we don't fly many ships that brawl unless they have an AB of some sort fitted.
---
Even if killboards don't mean anything (outside of showing what type of activity someone enjoys and has experience doing), there's still the idea that a kill in EVE can.  Fighting outnumbered and coming out ahead is one of the few ways competitive players can actually feel a sense of accomplishment, especially nowadays with the tournament scene completely gutted.
---
Didn't you know that there's a cloaky proteus on every anom?
---
I know. That's what I said

Rather than give massive amounts of sp to start or the starting skills, the tutorial and subsequent agent missions should give relevant skill points as part of the mission reward. If you enjoy explo, your scanning skills should increase as you run missions by a small amount. 
---
Create agent missions that teach navigation, power cpu and capacitor, and the other essentials in a way that will add value to the skill by having you see why you need them.
---
I'd also like to see a respec option for isk. 500 isk per skill point and let anyone do it. New players that put points in PI only to realize they don't enjoy that activity can cheaply refocus, while the rich can sink billions into cleaning up years of manic plan changes.
---
woooooosh
---
If someone wants you dead in Highsec, you're going to die if you undock.
---
If someone engages you, you might survive depending on sec status.
---
Right, and that's fine. That's what high security zones are for. They are secure - mostly.
---
The issue is when people want the rewards of lower-security zones without the risk.
---
255 rifters and a megathron?

^^So ^^they ^^wont ^^have ^^to ^^travel, ^^because ^^the ^^the ^^alts ^^will ^^already ^^be ^^there ^^with ^^super ^^carriers 
---
*he whispers to catch /u/touf25 up*
---
Thanks, much appreciated!
---
&gt;Safer than highsec because you could see stuff coming on intel from 5 systems away
---
Organize a group of 2-3k people in Hisec, populate a region and you can do the same
---
Imagine putting the PL logo on this and uploading it...
---
No see that's a lie. Maybe a half truth at best. If you are crabbing to earn money for PvP or better this or that fine. But 99% of the time you are crabbing for more crabbing ships or toons, and that my friend is fucking bullshit.
---
No, opinions are not facts, you do not get to chose them; you do less damage in isk attrition than they make ignoring you, making your perspective irrelevant.
---
Np my dude, and always remember that each targets strengths can be abused to become their weakness ✌️
---
Perfect saftey and perfect intel imply no one ever died in nullsec, i believe your spin to be a lie.
---
That’s not count for the number of combat drones you can carry, the bomber will die before they drop enough bombs to kill half of the minin drones Ii that fit 1 excavator
---
I extracted about 100m SP last year (80m on main, 20m on an alt), gave them away and then biomassed..... well what can i say, even that doesn't always work.
---
Halves (debatable) the yield but cuts the risk by 300%^^1. Just think about that, the EV for mining just increased 300%^^1 on a risk vs reward scale making the cost insignificant.
---
300% reflects living in fortress delve and using drones that are 350 times cheaper while still taking the blackout into account.
---
&gt; Fighting outnumbered and coming out ahead is one of the few ways competitive players can actually feel a sense of accomplishment, especially nowadays with the tournament scene completely gutted.
---
I'm not arguing against this at all, though I do think the game being a sandbox means it doesn't truly support this and it tends to mean that these players project their requirements for what they consider a good fight onto everyone else.
---
Personally, if it were up to me, I'd reinstate a dedicated tournament scene and try to convert abyssal pvp arenas into a form of ladder using the site loot as rewards but also potentially having tournament entry tickets among the loot drops or something like that. If the PLEX buy-in was replaced with needing x of these tickets, and the main way to get them was abyssal pvp, you could incentivize the tourneys and the ladder at the same time. A long digression for an unreviewed thought, but hopefully the sentiment is understood if nothing else.
---
A sandbox like the Eve of today just isn't particularly conducive to that kind of competitive experience.
---
&gt; Yeah, I think both your experience and resulting mentality are not held by very many people. Not that it makes them incorrect, by any means, just that it's quite difficult to understand your perspective.
---
This is the part that makes it difficult to argue certain points sometimes. It's a very strange side life from the blocs or the nano roamers. I can see into both perspectives reasonably well. But in the end, it's a video game, and the purpose is to enjoy it, so sometimes I feel like people are advocating for removal of quality of life that trades the fun of playing a video game for "muh killboard" or "muh ticks".
---
It's really hard to play when that's the only thing people care about and it's so much easier to just try to have a good time doing everything - ratting, roaming, mining/industry, blopsing, whatever you personally like doing - rather than treat people like they're subhuman for enjoying something you don't.
---
Enjoying things is great, but only so long as that something isn't oppressing people out of the game, like super umbrellas or renter landlording, in which case the playstyle should probably go for overall betterment.
---
I completely agree. If you rat in a VNI  (RIP) you make around 45 millions an hour. Let's say that is the normal income. That is 44 hours of ratting just to gather 2b for the plex. Even if you find something that gives you 3 times that isk, let's say you got lucky with the drops, that is 16 hours doing that thing. The suscription is just 15 usd, 1 usd per hour at best. I can't understand why people say it's expensive, for the entertainment it gives, 15 usd a month is almost free.
---
&gt; why not just get rid of "training time" or prereqs alltogether?
---
🤔
---
I mean, its an option.  A pretty goddamn radical one, but an option all the same.  Progression is a pretty integral part of MMO's afterall.
---
Use it or you lose it
---
&gt;People who fit nanofibers and fly kiting ships are the PvP definition of risk averse, and you'll notice that there's a lot of them out there.  
---
I've never quite understood this perspective, that somehow plunking down and brawling is the only "honest" pvp. Like, the ships and tools are in the game, it's just a different approach to pvp, people have different preferences in the tools they use.
---
Afaic, it's like the difference between playing the greatsword or dual blades in Monster Hunter. Or maybe wrestling vs. boxing, or jiu jitsu or whatever.
---
To be completely fair if hes living in a nullbloc where he can multibox rorquals like that, the changes have not affected his ability to do it at all, he should just get good and stop AFK'ing so he can recall drones  if need be.. or just use t2 that works to. hes just being childish. There is no excuse for being unable to adapt other than being a crybaby
---
Best way to invest $$$ is avoid gaming :D
---
Electricity costs more than that, lol. Might as well mine bitcoins.
---
It's not dishonorable, per se, it's just avoiding risk. Avoiding risk isn't inherently bad as a concept, but the follow up is the dishonor - when the roamers complain that their targets won't feed them free kills, when the hulks complain they still got ganked, etc.
---
You can avoid risk, but you still need to accept that there is still risk. My point with the whole nano thing is that the situation cuts both ways - it's not just the PvE players complaining.
---
I didn't know aryth was a person and still don't know who they are.
---
I heared Waffles is bleeding their miners by the hundreds
---
I see.  So you're just stating the obvious for the new players that don't know, in order to fly ships you have to buy them with isk.
---
Spend 2k $ (or more?) on a rig that can support 50 accounts, run it non-stop and use up shitloads of electricity. All this to get one free month of EVE for your main account. #logic
---
This is literally 100x worse than being a spodbrain.
---
Naw Ganking is a balance against people that think they can freely [take 21b freighters around](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78074656/)
---
I won Eve 5 years ago. My first shop goal was a Nemesis.
---
This makes me want to come back.
---
High PLEX prices mean ISK is devalued. While this can be good for people who fund their play though PLEX, it also means that players who are spending time to earn ISK instead of cash are getting less value for their time spent working. In the current case, this is a result of very easy access to large amounts of ISK (for the game as a hole, not necessarily an individual player). This means that players who don't spend large amounts of time earning ISK, particularly those players who get their wealth from the game instead of other players (mining, ratting, ect.) are having their time and current wealth devalued. This in turn forces the to either turbo crab to keep up with inflation. The problem with this is that many players don't enjoy or can't afford to setup 10 rorque accounts, or don't want to spend hours a day running incursions. Essentially what this means is that high PLEX prices hurt casual players who don't spend cash on ISK.
---
Looks like he hurt your feeling with that. The PvP players that only do PvP are children throwing throwing tantrums that PvE players are risk adverse because when working together the PvP players are denied what they want to do for fun. It is the same in every region of space. The constant "CCP made it too easy for groups of players to organize. CCP made it too easy for other players to work together. So CCP is killing the game."
---
Like I said if your looking for real solo skill pvp ,play halo , where everything is set even, no one has an advantage, just skills is what matters.
---
But thats not what I’m looking for when I play eve.
---
Don’t see where the hatred toward pve is coming from , just because people are making isk you want to hate ? 
---
Human beings as species will group together and gravitate towards safety in numbers , 
---
So unless you disable fleet forming as a mechanic, your pvp will always be unbalanced.
---
And ones you do that might as well offline eve.
---
Don’t get me wrong I’m loving the blackout, I’m killing mofo,s left and right , but I’m starting to get tired of just pvp , 
---
The best thing  from the blackout is killing all these ffing bots.
---
Tbh though the little guys are feeling the pain the most , you keep squeezing  , the bigger alliances will only get bigger and yes we will have our major wars trillions of isk will eventually go up in flames , it’s just CCP is greedy too , that’s the part you won’t hear about.
---
They want money now and quickly just like all corporations in the world.
---
Can’t wait for the alliances to get too big and blow up in flames .... no patience.
---
Fraternity the botters alliance of eve it ain’t no secret , they are getting massacred , do you know how much isk has been burned down ? For CCP makes money of those plexes that folks buy with plexes to pay for there accounts.
---
All plexes in game are money that CCP already pocketed , 
---
Love how this lets burn pve strategy, supposedly because you care for oh small Corp over there that get monkey stomped by huge alliances whenever they go in there space.
---
Bah , same greed at work as all human greed  is , it being isk or CCP profits.
---
Sorry but I read trough the smoke your blowing CCP.
---
What I always wished to see in Eve was smaller battles (relatively speaking) where tactics needed to be used. I always liked the idea of Cyno but wished that there wasn’t more fighting in and around them in order to get your main fleet in. I liked the idea there being a decision made by the FC over whether to send his or her smaller ships in to protect the Cyno and establish a “beach head” or to try and bullrush the caps in and risk them being scattered and vulnerable. I also liked the idea of the defenders, if they are ready,  having some time to react to a Cyno being lit and to have some fun defensive options. Hope this makes sense it’s 3am here.
---
Idea 1: Cynosaural field rules change- Cyno field now have mass limits and in order to use a Cyno field ships sensors must lock onto the Cyno in order to successfully reach the target system (requires target lock). Standard Cyno fields have a signature radius of “x” (frigate or cruiser). Signature can be modified by meta of Cyno (now meta Cyno will be added) and/ or ship bonuses. 
---
Idea 2 Cyno Jacker- when used on a hostile cyno the module allows all purples to use the field. This would allow cross jumping and potentially catching the attacking fleet in a vulnerable position. Module keeps the field open even if cyno ship is destroyed u til deactivated or fuel runs out. Lastly, the field temporarily scrambles IFF on  static structures for “x” amount of time, causing structures to temporarily be unable to lock incoming fleet. Requires fuel.
---
Idea 3: Cyno Disrupter- weakens Cyno making ships unable to use Cyno. Module and Cyno have “x” strength. Takes at least 2 disrupters to disrupt 1 Cyno. 
---
Idea 4: Cyno Stabilzer-adds “x” signal strength to Cyno field.
---
Idea 5: Cyno Scrambler- module has “x” strength, if the modules strength exceeds that of the Cyno the incoming fleet is scattered on the grid or even the system. Degree of scattering would depend on to what degree the strength of the Cyno was exceeded.
---
Idea 6: Cyno booster: module increases allowable mass of Cyno field or signal strength (script)
---
Idea 7: Cyno diffuser- weakens Cyno mass or signal strength (script)
---
X=whatever is best for balance
---
System wide cyno jammers absolutely need a nerf, but they still need to exist.
---
Nah, no killmails.
---
I mean slyce procurers are still some of the scariest ships to drop on for me.
---
Also it says those are high sec exploration fits I'm looking for a nullsec or Wh exploration fit. Is there a search function on the site?
---
Checking ADM's on Dotlan should answer your question, ADM's have nosedived with the exception of Delve and parts of a couple other regions.
---
I wonder if that is just the result of the mastery not taking into account implants.
---
Cap boosters
---
That's fair! There is a good deal of salt from a lot of pvp players about kite-y bullshit.
---
That is an apt summary of my emotional response.
---
I legit scared off a proteus in one once. Scanned down a site, found a Proteus partway through, was empty so I figured I'd throw a couple rocks at him to see what he did.
---
Dude warped out as soon as I told the drone to attack. Probably never even looked at the overview to see what was shooting at him.
---
Bitch.
---
Pretty sure you're spending more isk on the bombs than the T2 miners are worth, not to mention they're fast enough to pull back.  When I rorq mined, I lol'd when I trolled someone into bombing my T2 miners cuz not only were they isk negative, they had to put in a bunch of effort for nothing, while I was still watching Pornhub.
---
Exactly my point and for what ? To make CCP profits they don’t give a rats ass about you dude , be it a pvp or pve player. No they just care if that money income is growing that’s it.
---
I prefer you just tell me the real reason then some bs smoke.
---
All about the money ese!
---
If you are going to accuse someone of not being able to understand something "complicated", at least do it with proper spelling and grammar.
---
10/10
---
So Fucking True !
---
CCP cant make heads or tails of their data that much is obvious.
---
Over a year down the road and they still havent done it. So when are they going to remove old Legacy code rather than give out free SP?
---
Except there's no reward, only risk.   Most of you mouthbreathers don't seem to understand that if the risk heavily outweighs the reward, people aren't going to do it.  Then you get all :surprisedpikachu: when people stop doing it and adapt in another way, whining that they're "risk averse".
---
Who?
---
Always loved their videos. 
---
My mining lasers are over heating, need permission to let them cool down... DENIED!
---
Yeah its all fun and games until youre the guy left out to dry cause you cant fly a Rorq.
---
Rick the spin master at work. Solid post.
---
Deleted/Reposted because I came up with a better title.
---
Basically taking less isk per hour to remove nearly all risk.  With T2 you can shitfit the rorq and mine 24/7 on the cheap, and the only threat is a large fleet big enough to threaten the rorq itself.  Since the big boys mine under a super umbrella, this is basically no risk since there are no longer expensive drones to kill.  Even if you fuck up and don't get saved, you're out a couple bil while wasting a hundred enemy dudes' time.  Worth.
---
What if you could only jump/bridge to in-corp cynos?
---
For bigger fights, you'd need an in-cyno for each attending corp, or you'd have to bridge in those for other attending corps you want to keep unknown. And FCs could potentially prioritise which corps' ships to destroy to deny reinforcements during critical escalation moments.
---
For smaller scale situations, you'd know more from in-game data of whether someone is bait for notorious droppers or not.
---
Bigger picture, cyno alts would need to move to in-corp, it'd make logistic routes more visible to those scouting about to harass them, and also increase demand for higher corp-related SP, and better reflect a corp's projection potential through member count.
---
It'd still probably want to be combo'd with a spool-up delay, but I don't think it outright breaks any other playstyles or is trivially circumventable other than very fast bridging-&gt;light more cynos.
---
Weeb pokemon?
---
&gt; The requirements for PVE are quite exact about their minimums. You only need enough buffer that you won't get alphaed in between rep cycles and any more than that is completely wasted.
---
I'm fairly sure I recall some Incursion waves having significant alpha, but once the various different NPC weapon cycle timers take effect, as well as some get killed/EWARd, you don't need to rep the victim to full in 1 cycle else they then break to the 2nd volley. So that'd be a case where EHP is greater than rep dps.
---
I did say MAR+SAR, fitting an A-type small (~100mil) for 6PG more is a viable option, between the cap demand and cost of 2 MAR, and the resist option. P sure the small can at least do better than an A-type non-energised NM at similar cost (the typical step up from faction EANM, before deadspace ones).
---
Been saying it for a long time. The biggest thing going for Eve is a lot of players have too much time and money invested in the game to walk away from it. The biggest thing going for it. That's not good.
---
Sounds like you need to play with people you like
---
Wrong about why, specifically?
---
This guy said the exact shit Im trying to say.
---
I Salute you !
---
The picture being that panfam could be out escalated by Volta on their one doorstep?
---
Peak REEEEEEEEEE confirmed.
---
goes for rl too
---
Modern Problems require modern solutions.
---
What ? No I’m stating that massively disturbing pve ain’t creating better pvp environments !
---
Actually doing the opposite.
---
Dude stop smoking that crack and get on track lol 😂
---
You are the prime example of what nullsec players shouldnt have become, but sadly did. Pack up your shit, hope you are clever enough to find the door yourself.
---
The mechanics of pvp on eve are awful. However the consequences make it one of the most exciting pvp experiences out there. This guy obviously plays for the grind.
---
Weak
---
Well if you make your money with ratting or mining you'are fucked, moon mining still interesting, otherwise i think the blackout is great personally even if it hurt some of us, probably a good thing for Eve but they need to implement other "big change" to balance that making Eve dangerous again it's not a problem but the Risk/reward is very very small right now  
---
they can remove asset safety, making the ressource deplete (don't care that impact the big bloc) bring back the drifters / triglav , delay the API... but the risk/reward need to change aswell (even if i would prefer a entire rework of the PvE in NS, but meh, probably not gonna happen)
---
Turn carebears into drifters. Remove all single player missions, replace with scaled incursions. Completion of a max-level incursion opens a wormhole  to a random keepstar in 0.0 and grants a temporary buff of some kind to the fleet.
---
So you were afraid of a ratter in your curse so you dropped a cyno. Eve 2019
---
Pic reminds me of Brave vs point defense https://i.imgur.com/zy8OtpB.png
---
It's because you have a booster active, which is only applied to the time in the sheet for the time that it'll be active. The total time does less complex math and just assumes it'll be active for the entire time the skill is training, and the listing in the mastery sheet doesn't apply it at all.
---
Join the wormlife freeports alliance discord. Lots of nice people and freeported stations you can stage out of.
---
You can make huge amounts of isk in FW. Just don't convert the LP into stuff that doesn't sell. It's not fuzz-co fault if you try to sell stuff that nobody wants to buy.
---
What about the missions themselves? I thought it might be because you got to shoot empire rats a lot
---
T2 tier3 bs that can fit dread guns.
---
No the biggest mistake were Skill Injectors.
---
You know, I've been away for some time, slowly coming back. I was afraid to go back to mining now with all the bombers going nuts on the excavators. This thread makes me feel a lot safer using Mining II's than I've ever felt using excavators.
---
Ratting in a subcap is the most dangerous pve atm, crazy risk, shit reward
---
1 module then Scripts for ecm. Racial scripts, burst script, multispectral script, unscripted they jam everyone, scripted they are more power but the jam ship can be locked.
---

---
Blopsing a ratting ship is bad now? Or taking advantage of bloated megacoalitions?
---
Bah , all you have to do with a hel is neut it’s cap and buh by tank.
---
A nyx on the other hand keeps it tank even without cap 
---
Oh an nyx is the best looking super lol 😆
---
hard to find pvp if most of players is pve carebears, thats why
---
PI is awesome semi passive isk,terrible to set up but easily 1b+ per month using three characters on your account.
---
Also, carriers are great for making decent isk in null.
---
hmm, I have honnestly no idea
---
What you will see is a lot of people who declare that the carebears as they put it want to make totally safe spaces, and this is in fact them believing their own propaganda not the reality of the situation.   In fact the majority of people in hisec accept that there should be risk, there are very few people that ask for 100% secure play, but that is what is thrown at people like me when we suggest that certain mechanics are unbalanced. 
---
So for example I will say freighter bumping is a poor mechanic which enables risk free PvP by allowing the bumper to hold someone from warping until he gets bored.   I will instantly get accused of wanting a 100% safe space, as if I wanted to end ganking.      
---
That is what you are dealing with, a strident group who frame everything in absolutes.
---
ccp will likely milk the blackout and lack of local for as long as possible. they like to do things like this as "tests" for future patches and to see where to take the lore.
---
Ok, so...?
---
I need a “true” pvper that does 0% pve to speak up and explain to me how they get isk to buy there ships. Other then mom credit card.
---
I must confess that I didn't read what I wrote before posting, I should have yes.
---
I'm not a native english speaker so I will gladly accept your remarks on my spelling and grammar if you tell me.
---
It would have been much better if I had answered in french but you would probably not have been able to that nice comment. ;)
---
Do you live under a rock?!
---
Yup, not playing becomes more isk/hr than actually undocking and getting dicked over again. Fuck i even fit a pvp ishtar and got fucked, risk/reward is fucked in null, when you can be doing instanced pve while risking basically nothing.
---
sorry who's pandemic?
---
Woah woah.
---
You are wrong no one one is doing that.
---
Im right btw.
---
we have seriously been ratting and making isk non-stop since the blackout started. it didnt make it harder to rat, it made it easier. chances are high of being dropped, but most of the time people that get dropped are saved almost immediately. so isk making was slowed down, but we are still making isk
---
I mean we do, with like 8 dudes, and no blues

For years CCP has let the game slowly trend toward safer. The players will naturally take advantage of this and make themselves as safe as possible. In the current mechanics that means everyone went to supercap umbrellas, which are stupidly hard for others to deal with, to the point that it almost never happens. Obviously this means things are not well balanced, at least its obvious if you're not completely biased by it benefiting you anyway. Then there are obviously OP mechanics like infinite chain panics and so forth. The carebears that benefit from this think being almost untouchable is fine, and that pvpers need to "learn to adapt". Now the shoe is on the other foot and the carebears are crying for mommy ccp. Ur turn to learn to adapt bitch.

&gt;Over the last year, every change to the game has been anti-PvE players.

Lmao what, all changes the last decade have been buffing pve
---
&gt;Looks like he hurt your feeling with that. The PvE players that only do PvE are children throwing tantrums that PvP players want to introduce risk because when not working together the PvE players are denied what they want to do for fun. It is the same in every region of space. The constant "CCP made it too easy for hunters to hunt. CCP made it too easy for other players to kill my 20 multiboxed barge farm. So CCP is killing the game."

He is right though

Eve online is just a game like any other no different

The game is what people make of it if noobies want to live in null sec than that's their decision, changing the rules mid game( blackout asset safety removal) and forcing players to move to high sec or leave the game will be a very bad decision

Ask Blizzard how removing the RPG elements from an RPG is working out.
---
According to that logic there are no real PVE guys out there, right? Even mining is competing against other players, right? So why are miners and industrialists being called PVEers then?
---
Rorqs are typically sold with a lot of profit. My sheet says around 1,5b to build with maybe 2 week old JBV prices. But Delve doesnt follow JBV (especially since they broke it) in that sense, 1dq is a strong market.
---
Minerals will go down and prices will go up. The MER will show a massive drop but thats more to do with people just sitting it out. I am however seeing large amount of people selling off fitted rorqs, like alot alot. And others stuff as well actually, feels like many are leaving (just a drop in comparison tho but higher than usual).
---
But it will rebound rather fast I think, dont think blackout is permanent.
---
Madlad
---
So if i understood you correctly, you want the pvp'ers to shoot at someone else, not you. Justified by saying there are millions of things for them to do.  
---
That is exactly the point u/JanusGregorian makes though. If you don't like having unexpected interactions &amp; encounters then eve is not for you. Or atleast you should realise that you are complaining against one of the fundamental principales of the game.
---
None of these "disadvantages" is likely going to make a difference VS a new player's inexperience.  If we're talking 2 pros of equal skill against each other, than nearly EVERY skill relevant to a ship gives an unfair advantage, so following this logic you have to give every noob their ship and turret skills to 5 too, or they have a disadvantage!!
---
For practical purposes a new player can use a meta ship fit without these skills and be about as effective as if they had them, because the limiting factor is generally player skill at that point.
---
possibly dumb opinion, i love flying punisher, im pretty sure its not great, and my newbie little alpha ass is still working up to a t2, but its so much fun to just fly about in null, ratting inbetween exploration runs, and its a good looking ship too
---
i love my punishers, cheap and fuckin effective for what i do
---
So,   
---
You mean that NPCs should go on deployments and invade space from their home NPC regions to try and expand their space. The only way to rat would then be to attack NPC space.   
---
People who run missions for NPCs would band together to defend their timers where they would get LP payouts based on defending them.
---
better question: what made you go back for the venture skill
---
It's almost as if you get out of Eve what you put into it
---
The Game needs to be balanced for both PVE and PVP, it is a shit show if after sorting out a small gang roam into Null to have a load of titans drop and boson you before you can even engage. I accept that PVE is an aspect of the game that many gravitate towards for different reasons and in a sandbox that should be fine but again an element of risk is needed and perhaps the blackout has moved the risk continuum to far the wrong way. CCP appear to be throwing crap at a blanket and seeing what sticks at the moment and  there is an element of panic in the air about that. I suspect there is an element of truth in the whole missing targets Pearl abyss not happy riff.
---
If you're new, I promise you most of your deaths will be to making mistakes/lack of experience, not to a 5% here or there.  It is overblown.
---
You really want to fuck with nullsec alliances? then get them all banned from reddit, if you can't shitpost whats even the point of playing
---
Use the Omega ones you found and replace T2 modules with meta4 if necessary, done.
---
Pretty much.  Moves like this turn this into a completely different game, and if you remove all complexity, the gameplay itself isn't good enough to survive as a mainstream faceroll game.
---
All I mean is take the main isk source from one blue and put it in the other blue's space. Eventually they will turn on eachother.
---
So basically the 1000 goon titan alts would be unassailable because who could afford to inject titan alts at 3 times the current cost? The current cost of injecting a pilot is already twice the cost of the hull. OR you can always train it manually and wait for two years while you put plex or money into that account subscription.
---
They should have had that limitation from the start. It would have mitigated the sideeffects by a lot. Kinda surprised that theres still no limitation.
---
&gt;If I'm ratting I'm trying to beat the other guy to the sites to make more isk [...]
---
I generally agree with you. PVE has a pvp component due to player driven markets. I find it hard to call "let me turn on the bounty isk faucet on in my sea of blues while protected by super pilots i've never even talked to" hardly pvp though.  
---
The pvp you describe is based on maximising interactions between players, not reducing them to the bare minimum.
---
Because they hate themselves...... o.O
---
can i have it, im new?
---
Hmm interesting.
---
Well, normal?
---
i grew up in Azer, fuck yea
---
How many foreign languages do you speak well enough to get a point across?
---
*and use them to pay for injectors
---
Regarding the cash grab: that will be very short term. I've noticed that especially since the interview with Hilmar and Falcon, people have started to leave null or even the game in earnest. At the least they are reducing accounts. Many had hopes it would be temporary but it now appears it won't be. That kills a lot of people's play style, not just bots.
---
So when there were outposts you had everything in a pos?
---
Lets see: In null you have your super umbrella that will jump on any t1 frig that is coming into your space. In highsec you fly by hundreds of neutrals that all could gank you. I don't know why null is a safer place than high.
---
&gt;endgame  
---
you're doing something fundamentally wrong
---
This. If you don't have the numbers, keeping intel up reliably is impossible, leaving the indy and pve members not daring to do the stuff they were doing. So they leave or quit.
---
True
---
Brilliant I like it.
---

I went to high-sec while I wait out my accounts to unsub. Mining in high sec sucks ass. I wanna beat the shit out of whoever thought about the blackout.

---
&gt;People who fit nanofibers and fly kiting ships are the PvP definition of risk averse, and you'll notice that there's a lot of them out there.
---
"Brawl like a man, you nanofag" he said while the nullblocs wiped his brawling battleship of their supercap windshields.
---
&gt;"But if I fit scram and brawl (like a man), they light a cyno!" the 'elite pvper' says.
---
Because short ending a roam because you get a 50/50 chance of a cyno being lit is gambling. Not pvp.
---
&gt;Killing a human player's ratting VNI (pre-dronebay cut) with a beam Retribution for example is similarly as risk-averse as the guy flying the ratting Thanatos with a cyno. But you'll notice the people complaining about the Thanatos lighting a cyno on them aren't exactly eager to see their beam Retributions less able to gank the VNI
---
If you listened to the guys that invented the nano beam retri, you will find that they were highly critical of it's strenght.   
---
You don't use a dull knife to cut tomatoes. That's why people bring the retri/thanatos. Not because they want to be risk adverse.
---
Everybody criticizing the hel pilot, but what the fuck were their dictors doing? How hard is it to bubblefuck a 700m/s super with no smartbombs and his fighters in.
---
shitfit
---
You need to look at market value, not only isk/lp ratio.
---
Some of the higest rated stuff doeasnt sell at all.  But you can generaly find stuff that sells well, you just wont get as high ratio.
---
Stuff that sells well and fast is often ammo.
---
&gt;TL;DR All players who don't form massive blobs of tens of thousands of players where the individual player is just a number should be ignored by CCP and i hate CCP for doing something that doesn't benefit my personal playstyle  
---
FTFY
---
Thanks for advice, maybe I will try with Caldari Navy Antimatter. I see a bunch of High-Grade Talon Omega so I decided to buy 1, luckily I don't buy so much
---
about half of vni's i have shot didn't have any light drones
---
&gt;Thats utter bullshit.
---
Supers and ratters weren't using local as an intel tool to dock up instantly the moment a neutral entered system?
---
\#Newsflash, you are the bad narrative. What u/Meglomaniac stated is much a fact as gravity. Please stop spinning your lies.
---
I’ve seen the same thing myself with neutral attributes and no implants/boosters running, think it’s a bug
---
I mean, ye pretty much.
---
The problem people dont seem to get is organisation, thats whats "killing" Eve. No mechanic NS is using for defense would work if they didnt work together in some way. They only way to inflict any real damage is by other organised groups and outside of the odd NPSI fleet thats other NS groups. Any change that will help the small guy will help these groups even more and they dont really need the help in that sense, they are still accomplishing goals atm.
---
The main issue I see is the want to balance small gang with big gang, like the "good ole days". But that Eve is gone, NS is too rich, too much SP, too much manpower, too organised and too many big toys. All the nerfs people want are directed at these things but realistically you can only nerf some of these things but manpower and organisation are really hard to nerf. Atleast without shattering the game completely. 
---
Eve needs another direction, it needs to balance small gang with small gang and promote content there. The current path isnt gonna give anyone what they want in the end, its just gonna piss off NS and in the end small gangs are not gonna be able to outblob the blob, no matter what ships they use.
---
What are the eve shakes?
---
That would technically be a fat rifter
---
Plan ahead, the game doesn’t stop moving just because you go away. Move the big, important stuff out to a station like we all did before.
---
This is peak level retardness.
---
Still lurk the community though...
---
To be a bit gentle with the guy I'm pretty sure he wanted to say Drifter not Rifter :P
---
i thought the Stratios could be a small Domi.... gigX didn't agree :(
---
Thats abit more meddling than CCP should engage in. I sense you dont have a stake in null since you're so cavalier with other peoples relationships, time and effort.
---
Lived there for years now. All anyone in null tries to do is Diplo themselves out of fights.
---
He play this game to have his kind of fun \[you know, EvE is video game made for entertainment\], and he is paying CCP his money for what he is considering fun. 
---
Now he will not play game, because its no fun for him, CCP will have less money, and hunters will have -1 potential target.   
---
I guess that's win for all .... right?
---
A New player would still have the option to buy a capital pilot alt which doesn't increase the amount of capitals in eve online but just shifts it from one player to the next.
---
I\`m sorry I dont think you play your own game.
---
Yea I would love to see capital fuel prices sky rocket so that its not worth dropping a super on a t1 cruiser looking for some pvp.
---
Sounds like the Khanid Purge lol
---
Join Rvb you can have alt in other corps/ally we don't give a shit. We have everyday FW fleets between 15 and 25 ppl
---
And. Alot of fun on comms
---
That's brilliant, would you push your luck by using a dscanable ship ? :p
---
An industrialist certainly isn’t a PvE player - their prices and profitability are directly dictated by market demand and supply, and they compete with other sellers by undercutting or selling elsewhere. This neglects all the gameplay around investment and return management.
---
The stereotypical PvE player is the one who just runs missions, or anomalies, whose only meaningful contribution to the economy and game in a broader sense (if PvE is all they do) is selling faction/complex loot, and dying at the hands of other players.
---
I think we didn't read the same story
---
I accidentally set materials efficient research to 10% instead of five percent and let it run for a few days.
---
If i cancel now, do I still get the \~7% I would have gotten in this time?
---
Didn't of that, can you develop? :)
---
dont give them ideas!
---
So all of a sudden, the space owned by Blue #4716 is twice as valuable because it has twice as many ISK sources? Okay, so Blue #3515 just moves in with Blue #4716. 
---
# Twice as many people to defend the space from neutrals. 
---
What increased tensions? I think '15 and '16 would *love this shit*. 
---
Or do you think CCP should just *delete* the ISK sources from #3515's space and not migrate it at all? 
---
I really am struggling to understand your post. I think you should talk with less metaphor, and more with plain statements and assertions.
---
To be fair... is that wrong?
---
I think all skills should simply be made into optional skills that improve your ship maybe 10-15% at level 5. If you make tons of isk then you should be encouraged to fly the most expensive ships you possibly can, instead of being stuck behind a skill-point wall. 
---
To compensate for titan alts no longer requiring twice the hull cost in skill points, the hull cost can now be more expensive, same for all the other ships where the hull cost is entirely laughable (carriers, dreads, supers, t1 subcaps, faxes). 
---
When you say goons have 1000 titans what you're really saying is that goons have 1000 titan characters, each worth roughly 80-120bn depending on how perfect its skills are. The hull cost is half that. Even if you managed to perform the greatest victory of all times and kill 250 goon titans in one fell swoop, you'd only kill 8.3% of the titan assets because the SP is such a big portion of the titan assets, so the alliance must only SRP a very small amount when fielding titans. 
---
So when I fly two faxes and two titans, I have nearly 300bn isk in SP, if I were to inject these pilots, and about 140bn in hulls and fits (and that's with 6bn isk faxes). If there is 10% game speed and we have a 10 hour real time fight where 1 hour game time occurs, and we kill 50 titans and the enemy kills 50 titans (Out of 1000), then I have a 1 in 20 chance of losing one titan, 1 in 400 chance of losing both. That means on average I lose about 8bn per X47 fight. But alliance provides SRP assuming I use the correct fits, so risk is zero in stratops, and very low in umbrella defense. Given that these X47 scale fights take place maybe once a year on average, that's a daily loss of 19M isk or so, so effectively I'll lose more isk by flying subcaps than a titan (I have to pay the platinum insurance cost, AFAIK SRP does not cover that, I haven't bothered with subcap SRP in two years so I wouldn't know). 
---
The fact that SP is a commodity worth isk, a commodity that you HAVE TO HAVE to be allowed to risk assets on the battlefield, makes the risk/reward ratio out of whack. The SP can't be touched, but you have to earn the isk for it, so when you reach the point where you fly a carrier, super or titan, the cost of the hulls are completely besides the point because the SP cost is massive. The hull cost of a carrier is practically like gasoline cost for a Ferrari, because the SP cost is so massive and the hull cost so tiny. If you can afford the SP, you can afford to fling carriers and supers and titans around willy nilly with zero regard for risk, because even if you lose the ship your 65-95% of your true wealth is secure in SP.
---
Look, it's retarded.

Fantastic suggestion, when I was with FA in Fountain we had to actively patrol our POS because of the locals. I would love something like this again
---
ORE BPOs, but that's about it.

Cruiser sized boosher akin to a HIC with a scriptable targeted boosh to boosh tethered assets and capitals off.

Yeah, this is easier for developer to execute than the idea on the post even though they are about the same thing

Resource deplition.  Krab drama kills alliances
---
What about an industrialist in a Wormhole who doesn´t compete with anyone and simply offers a service (building stuff for his corp)?
---
And there is plenty of players out there who just enjoy producing stuff, who would make more money by selling the mats directly, but they don´t care about max profit.
---
Not everything necessarily leads to PVP. The will to shoot stuff is what is leading to PVP or having a competetive mindset in general.
---
 \&gt;using meme arrows unironically on reddit
---
\&gt; still doing it wrong
---
epic
---
lol you have zero industry guys? So basically you buy everything in jita and think that's a price close to the build cost? You are doomed. 
---
PS: There are no "pure" industry people, industry is just a low-click way of turning X isk into X+% isk, which then becomes (X+%)+% isk, which then becomes ((X+%)+%)+% isk, etc.
---
Plex is not FREE, it requires a lot of work in game (aka many hours) or a hour of overtime in RL.          
---
Want to work in game - try running triglavian sites.
---
You are a constant attempt to kill the game.
---
And this is why I mine in procs. 50k ehp is nice
---
Nofearion, besides if you have 4 accounts there are ways of making isk  outside of null, that dont take much more time.
---
You just got comfortable in null, it was easy and you had it all figured out. You can go to lowsec, or wh's and do well there.
---
You could just put one char and run regular hisec incursions. 
---
Point is there are other options
---
I am willing to put a lot of hours into the game, how much will it cost for PLEX to get a month of omega time?
---
I actually got the feeling that it was never going to be permanent. I listened to it tho but when I just read the notes I felt it was going to be permanent. The impression I got from listenting is that it was never even meant to be permanent, just a test.
---
AAR?
---
That's not human nature. The coalitions get along because they can easily segregate who is entitled to rat where. If you force them to share space then it won't be long before there is a blue on blue. Enough blue on blues will cause an all out war.
---
Oh yeah, there are plenty of inactive corps in wormholes in all kinds of Cs (even found some in C4-6, but C5-6 are a bit rarer because it's easier to drop caps to bash on them). I just knocked down an inactive Raitaru solo and got around 1bil of loot actually. You don't need to maintain hole control when a corp is inactive. You can check inactivity through zkillboard, evewho and checking the number of signatures in system. Most wormhole dwellers will clear most of their signatures, so if they have a dozen or more, it's usually a sign of an inactive corp. It's also not a perfect method of checking inactivity because systems where there are a lot of daytrippers (C1-3 with HS static) will also have fewer signatures and you might not see killboard activity if they're not registered on zkillboard or if they're good at evading hunters.
---
If you want to attempt a solo eviction, you can make it a bit safer by dropping a POS (since they only take 15 mins to anchor, vs 24hrs for Citadels), which let's you bring in more ships, ammo and refits and gives you a safer place to retreat to if the wormhole is more active than you thought. Watch out though, a reinforced citadel and unmanned ships behind a POS is a clear sign that an eviction is happening, so you might attract attention from a third party trying to get a few kills. Ammo and refits are probably fine since most people will simply think your POS is a dead stick that nobody bothered to remove.
---
Alternatively, there are corps who specialize in evictions (Holesale comes to mind) where they also have a loot sharing program. This allows you to hit stronger active targets and maintain hole control.
---
You decloak as you boosh. It's a really bullshit exploity bug that shouldn't work, and is nearly impossible to counter in most circumstances.
---
Subs that used to be afk docked up? Supers can dock in everything now I guess?
---
Fking blatant lies. You and him think bots are players.
---
Don´t even try or the game will become a second job and you will burn out fast.
---
Some people might comment and tell you how much ISK you can make by doing exploration, but I wouldn´t recommend that at all, unless you can fly a cloaky ship (which requires Omega).
---
Just spend $15 and play the game for fun.
---
This is such a bad post. Why not just wait for the fight to finish and then someone can post a full BR (with an AAR preferably).
---
Dude, whatever you're smoking, it's making you retarded.
---
20$ but if you are just to buy sub from ccp you can get like 12$ per month
---
Nobody with a brain posts here anymore. It’s all wormholersbtw.
---
If it wasn't for that bullshit you would barely have been able to gate your booshers without dying to me.
---
He does not deserve staingate!!!!!!!123
---
You can do that in lowsec, running fw missions, runing level 5, or just  running combat anomalies and level 5.
---
Or in hisec running incursions, or running burners, or abyssal.
---
Some of those require some setup (getting standings mostly), but after that, you login and do it for 30 min, and then logout its perfectly fine.
---
Get a job irl and if you need plex.   It’s much easier to work 1-2 hours irl than grind 20hrs for plex
---
The lightning bolt clearly shows that your skill queue is being boosted. like with the free extenders just given out?
---
This fight would not have happened if it wasn’t for blackout .  CCP is making EVE dangerous again and it’s awesome
---
The miners were blowing up, bough for some weird reason there was one fraternity venture that we killed as well...
---
come back ;)
---
wre not dead yet u know
---
I have no idea why you decided to post to reddit?
---
Couldn't have happened to a nicer bunch of bots.
---
Youre funny. But you dont know what youre talking about. Just spinning a narrative.
---
Good riddance
---
Yep, you can train up to 3 but can't multibox on the same account (so you can't mine with 1 character while you're exploring with the other)
---
To get started, you need to get a multiple character training certificate either with ISK from the market, $ from the account management section or PLEX through the PLEX store. Then, activate it on your account. This will let you activate another skill queue on the same account, that you can then use to train whatever skills you want. That character will have the clone state of the account, so it will be omega if you are omega and alpha if you are alpha..
---
Note that creating the characters is free, you just won't be able to start the skill queue without getting a MCT. Alternatively, you can pause training on your main character to train another character.
---
Da’fuq are you smoking?  I tried to read this but im sober and it made my brain ache
---
You shoot at people
---
No, you only get an improved blueprint if you finish the research. If you cancel the research, it will have 0% material efficiency.
---
This is the best suggestion I've seen on how to handle injectors short of deleting them (which sadly isn't going to happen)
---
Eve has good pvp system. 
---
Problem is mostly people in big alliances. They have their systems, and then they have their blues or renters and you need 10+ jumps just to get to a system where you might potentialy find some targets.
---
But if you are in ls, on wh, or even in small npc null corp, content is right there on your undock, or within 5j of it.
---
And the only fight you find if you are in a blob, is a gank, or another blob.
---
PVP in eve is fun when you are in up to 15-20 people fleets
---
Are you actually surprised that hunting groups specifically target the largest groups?
---
Yes!
---
Pick a side and join either the npc FW corp or a player corp that does FW.
---
This is mainly PVP, so you might not get rich with LP stuff. Do it for fun, not for profit.
---
We found OP
---
You should buy game time from CCP for the first year at least before trying to grind plex in game.
---
Don't do this to yourself, you will hate the game before you can enjoy it.
---
If you really HAVE to Plex your account then exploration can give you good isk for low risk. It's really luck dependant though.
---
Wages aren't the same in different countries you know. Though, the prices are regional too, like in Steam, but for me at least, my country gets the European pricing despite the average salary being like 3x less than most of Europe. Oh well, just gotta hustle more.
---
So work 3 hours IRL, its still faster to make plex with a part time job than to grind in game.   I hate the "we have a bad economy" excuse for being a lazy person
---
[removed]
---
I'm my entire career I've come across only a handful of nullsec PVPers (and most lowsec for that matter too) that want 'fair' engagements. I'm not a noble paladin out for a contest of skill in Eve nor am I a bully, I'm a pirate trying to fuck someone up to take their shit.
---
If they bring a good fight good on them. If they escalate, fair play, I'll do the same. This is a violent space sim and null PvP has no rules. Play how you want. If you get pissy because someone didn't follow your made up ruleset, fuck you.
---
So it’s the Excavators which are the problem? I do agree, if you look in Delve at the mo, they have all swapped to Mining Drones II which solves the problem
---
If your RL wallet allows it I would recommend just   paying for the sub. If not, play the game as an alpha for a while, it takes time to have the ingame skills and knowhow to plex your accounts from ingame means. Good starter sources for isk is nullsec mining, wormhole huffing, abyssals and  exploration (wormholes).
---
That's already in the game and it's called "Trainig Time Multiplier".
---
A single pve player mostly does pve solo and creates meaningful content only for him/herself. 
---
A single pvp player creates content for everyone he fights against and with. You can't do pvp alone. You always need at least someone to fight against (unless you call shooting your own alts pvp). Also every ship/module he loses or kills has to be replaced so it creates pve content for industrialists/miners.
---
Purely doing pve creates stagnation in economy and creates problems in a game where most of the content is player made.
---
It's alright, as a pve player myself I unsubbed two accounts. Two less targets in space. Hurts CCP's earnings even if minimal. Op success.
---
I am Ron Burgundy?
---
Eve is full of players and devs, who despite the advertising, want/expect you to play in specific ways. If you fall outside this classification you're just an 'idiot' or 'newb' or 'care bear'.
---
It's actually closer to 6 hours for me, and I can make much more space monies in that time.  
---
But I do pay for sub with money if there are good discount deals, and buy the DLC packs once in a while, just saying that there are people unable to work, or can't find a job, and for them grinding ingame is the only option.
---
I don't think kitey pvp ships are bullshit. They are a viable strategy just like brawling and have a counter just like anything else. Get a friend/ alt, tackle, scram warp to and fist hard with your brawler. Why people think they're should only be 'honourable' 1v1 PvP with brawler fits I don't know. That's just not smart.
---
I think snuffed out would be a good fit for you, why dont you join an entity that plays the game like you want it played instead? You get the gameplay you want and snuffed out gets another player they can use to make things happen

you’re going against the circlejerk tho

 Well, I could be wrong, but I believe diversity is an old, old wooden ship that was used during the Civil War era.
---
You pompously ousted us out of Deklein, and now it is a spawning pool of bots.
---
You satisfied?
---
&gt; What he's suggesting wouldn't penalize an industry veteran with a boatload of manufacture and research and PI and trade SP from getting into FW frigate PvP for fun though.
---
Yeah, and that's actually a bad thing. This change will benefit veterans with lots of ISK more than newbies. Just adjust the training time multiplier instead.
---
At the end of the day we all play games to have fun. If he gets that from mining/PVE, then so be it.
---
My point was that you seem to draw a straight line between highsec newbies and nullsec (preferably large blocks) end-gamers, and I disagree with that view.  
---
Most of the people who do not currently live in  nullsec know about it and have chosen not to live there. Most of the highseccers who are afraid of jumping to nullsec are scared on general principles, the blackout doesn't change much from that perspective.  
---
Nor is nullsec space the only place where you will die doing things in space.  
---
I absolutely agree that risk vs reward should be the order of the day. That it has been grossly skewed toward riskless reward in a lot of nullsec is another fact, which CCP is (clumsily, as usual) trying to address.
---
The only reason this is not landing on my next t-shirt is it's just too long.
---
if you cannot find a minimum wage job, you probably shouldn't be mining or ratting on a gaming rig in EVE
---
You know you don’t have to go to nullsec right?  You don’t have to leave krab wormholes or hisec or even lowsec, you don’t *have* to go to nullsec and thus you don’t need to bitch at ccp begging for nerfs so you can go to it on your terms only
---
I full d-scan and probe retooling would be a sweet followup to the local changes. Moving the game a bit further towards submarine warfare.
---
A separate Cyno for supers and Titan's that required 30x the fuel cost, to stop people from dropping supers on a single af roaming their space make it not worth the cost.
---
And you don't have to reply to Reddit posts you disagree with, but here we are.

Join a group and make EVE what YOU want    
---
Nullsec is more alive than ever before. The bots are finally silent
---
In my small gang we most often fly kitchen sink fleets, so there will be gankers and kiters in the group, as well as fast tackle and hard second tackle. First tackle on grid first, kiters/ second tackle second, then the brawlers because it makes sense. 
---
Funny how a mixed fleet of ships give you a broader engagement profile.
---
upvoted you because it’s sadly true.  But against the “i’m elite” circlejerk of “pvp” krab hunters
---
Ah yes Dracarys. Those idiots paid us 20b to get us to stop cloaky camping their bot supers and we just used the money to make more alts lol.
---
AAR: SNUFF catches a Nyx ratting, Dragon Empire bait crew goes in to get an escalation. 5 Titans and 6ish supers drop, INIT rushes to secure tackle from a w-hole a few jumps away. We hold tackle for 7mins while SNUFF mids dreads. Titans start dying. LONG LIVE THE BLACKOUT.
---
.... So don’t try and fight giant alliances with titan blobs with a “small gang roam”?
---
Novel concept, but no other game has players who think they should bring less people, less gear, but should beat bigger more organized groups. You can’t bring underleveled gear and half the max player group to a raid in ANY other game.  You can’t join a pvp zone with underleveled, undergeared players against a max gear pvp fit team and expect to win
---
If you know they have a titan and super umbrella and hunt their anyway, it is the epitome of ignorance to assume they won’t be used to hand you a participation trophy win because you 1) refuse to match what they have and 2) want to fight them anyways
---
Getting enough isk to PLEX your subscription is certainly doable, but it gets much easier with more skills, better equipment and more experience. If PLEXing is your goal as a new player, you'll have a hard time, and your only achievement is to be able to keep playing. Alpha restrictions are good enough to let you experience most of the game, and don't limit you much when you're just starting. If you feel you like the game and want to go omega, you'll have a better experience when you start with a subscription. Otherwise you'll spend so much time grinding the required isk, that you'll likely stop enjoying it, and it's a game after all.
---
This legit has to be bait, noone can be such a sook.
---
*to imperium 
---
There was more init there than snuff
---
Not in the imperium btw
---
Hunting people in space that hundreds if not thousands of said rafters allies are in is not safe but is possible.
---
It never will be safe , despite the cries of the hunters
---
He is 4x and strategy games youtuber/streemer
---
Let me please clear a few things up. First and foremost, I do not solo play, I am in a great corp with a lot of really cool guys and a rather large alliance with a lot of chill people. I know how to make isk, I can do it in Null, Low, or High. I am not asking to b e comfortable in Null, quite the opposite. 
---
Message in a nutshell. 
---
Intel needs to be balanced both ways.  - There are large Empty areas of Null sec - if things do not change it will get worse. 
---
The many who do not speak up and do not have time are the ones who actually pay the bills,
---
Botting in Bad, blue doughnuts are worse. This will make the Big blue stronger larger and more out of control.
---
I mean, you laugh but this game will be at an all time low player count within the year because you retards screech until CCP does the most retarded shit.
---
Anyways, go ahead and !remind yourself to come back to this post in a year so I can laugh at you.
---
Are they reeeally sure the user numbers aren't because they are handing out free skill points like candy lately?
---
Hellmar ?
---
No.
---
Snuff dreads killed the titans
---
Eve PvP tends to cause you to shake in a combination of fear and excitement. This tends to occur with more intensity the more you have on the line. A lot of players tend to chase that feeling.
---
Lol I was in that fleet, I saw one of you uncloak and noped the fuck outta there.
---
/r/gatekeeping
---
Wow, everything you said is wrong!
---
Snuff brought 40 dreadnoughts and 8 carrier on that related. We brought a good number of stukas. On top of that it was originally a snuff operation as far as I understood it. So OP is right imho.
---
Cui honorem, honorem.
---
the real problem is the size of the fields some of the corporate farms are pushing 1500 acres+ which when turned over in the fall lose tons of topsoil.
---
some people actually join this game for pve, and everyone goes mad when such player is unhappy to be forced to pvp
---
You asked a lot of question. My advice is just log in and play this awesome game and stop asking so many questions on Reddit
---
Yeah thanks. Not really what I was asking though. 😉
---
dont call init imperium its an offense
---
call them snuff friends :)
---
PVP is the end point of all that industry. You mine (or PVE) for industrialists to build (or sell directly to PVPers) shit to feed what should be a never ending war machine. Without constant loss, you cause drastic ballooning currency inflation and a drop in commodity prices until all your efforts in industry and mining are completely pointless. 
---
The risk in PVE is marginal at best once you know what you're doing so that doesn't fix anything in any meaningful way. The only way to ensure a healthy economy is to ensure PVP and loss continues to happen. The blackout is meant to help exactly that to create an economy course correction. 
---
TL;DR: your PVE efforts would be pointless without PVP.
---
Ima go ahead and say that the 62 Snuff dreads prolly did more of the work than the 74 INIT bombers.
---
&gt;claiming 'PvP players just want to pick on people, they just want one-sided 'fights' so they can feel better about themselves'
---
But that is absolutely true. Outside of large alliance fights which are actually aimed at achieving some greater objective, **literally all** PvP in EVE is done by people who want to prove their superiority by beating other people.
---
good to see titans dying, doesn't matter who they belong to, good shit
---
I'm amazed no one saw this coming when Iron Crown threw titans/supers around so freely in Cache, out of range of most of their friends in FRT - it was the ideal target for a large dreadbomb 
---
props to Dragon Empire, they really got the ball rolling
---
And you are bitching because it's not as safe as before. And you're scared it could be made even more at risk. What are you if not entitled to it?
---
But the Nyx got out, right?
---
Have you ever wondered why EVE is the only successful sandbox on the MMORPG market? When the likes of Mortal, Darkfall, or recently Albion failed?
---
I'll give you a hint: it's all *because* of highsec.
---
Always
---
Your question is so dumb.  Log in and play the f’ing game and get off Reddit
---
Oh drop the bullshit. Market competition is not PvP, or every MMORPG ever made is a PvP game.
---
How do I get this blue alliance flair after my name?
---
They are literally staging their titans out of a Goon KS in their own staging system.
---
If 74.75EUR is of no value to you can you give it to me
---
Punisher isn't bad, sand retri is awesome.
---
Damage dealth should be calculated based on the inertia of the ship, i.e a lightning fast destroyer will do the same damage as a medium-fast BC
---
this could make for interesting anti-titan dreadbombs, just jump to cyno 10km away from target krab titan and overheat you 50k mn MWD, hit siege to massively increase mass, hilarity ensues
---
Alternatively, Rorquals
---
They don't react to other ventures, we've been having a field day farming them.
---
What do you mean? Eve actually exists? I thought this was a roleplay subreddit.
---
Stop being a cunt and get off Reddit.
---
Good to know, thanks :)
---
Nice work
---
The dragon ball rolling? :sunglasses:
---
Depends on the region.
---
Great Wildlands is pretty active for content. Lot of low/null refugees went there about a year ago. Fighting there is pretty good, living there might not be so easy.
---
Syndicate can be pretty good for both living and fighting, but there's some strong groups there so setting up a realistic shop is unlikely unless you have a lot of friends.
---
Outer Ring is totally dead, Initiative have turned it into a moon mining farm and they don't like people too close to their krabs. Pretty fucked up for a sov bloc to oppress NPC null regions in addition to what blocs do to sov null, but it is what it is.
---
Venal is extremely active near the mission running hubs and occasionally the MTO2 gate, especially in Russian timezones. It's pretty empty once you move away from there.
---
Curse has lots of Fraternity mission runners, but nobody really lives there as their main home. You can still get fights pretty easily and they usually will fight you one or two times on more realistic terms before they blob you.
---
Stain is pretty active and there's always the relic site runners to fight/compete with, plus intra-regional skirmishes and the occasional brawl with Test/Legacy.
---
some of these titan pilot names sound awfully suspicious
---
It's a legitimate question and your response is pretty garbage tier.
---
If you buy bling ships now you will die horribly and make people like me very happy. Buy t1 frigs and cruisers, join small roams and learn your way up the ladder. If you try to skip steps you'll only fall harder.
---
Friend. If you have the Point to Leave the game so you cant deal with anything in the game. it is your path to leave! you cant tell me the thing is the wast of game. the point is you love the game and you love to play the game but you are not happy about the changes. you need to play your own mind game: leave the game or play and deal with the changes, that and only this is the trueth.
---
Ok thank you for the awesome advice. 
---
I’ll go back to enjoying my awesome life, playing eve, and everything in between.   I’m happy with my life, how about you???  I sense some frustrations
---
I've had no issues with my reactor in a low traffic low sec system. 
---
Depending on how much you're investing it can pay itself off in a week. With vulnerability timers you can time your jobs so even if it's bashed you have time to complete the job.
---
No, is that where you live?
---
You know, some alliances have a rule that you must have a fax in order to have a super or titan.
---
Seems like a good rule.
---
now we just need anti titan subcap platforms so people don't just throw them out like they're old socks without a support fleet.
---
Thanks
---
Lol k
---
Oo, thank you!
---
Not really, there are 200 posts on Reddit over the past week about the state of NS.  This is either a troll post or the author doesn’t know how to read
---
it doesn't look like the FAXes helped them much
---
Yes and no. Cap alts still took time to train and supply was limited. Injectors are sold by the warehouse.
---
I still think that for the most part people are slow-training into Rorqs/caps with just one or two injectors to speed up critical skills. It really only takes like 6 months to get a JDC5 dread with t1 guns and 6-7k dps. A rorqual or fax takes about the same amount of time and the JDC5 skill transfers seamlessly between each after you've attained the first one.
---
Injectors aren't ideal, but the issue is more that capitals are so powerful and everyone has alts now that there's no reason not to spam their usage, whereas before there was only so much of an incentive.
---
Same with your comment?
---
Any reason you dont like this ship?
---
He specified *NPC* null. Maybe you're the one who has problems reading.
---
I think you mean "a super umbrella that **might** jump on any **gang** that comes in your space **if** you're on comms, in the standing fleet, in range **and** you have a cyno fit **and** you survive long enough for it to make a difference... as opposed to HS where an unkillable force of NPC police kill any non-wardec who attacks you".
---
@your SP lvl I would suggest trying either incursions, null/wh exploration, faction warfare or Abyss sides. Any of those yield you more then 10 mil/h.
---
about extracting and reinjecting: it doesn't matter whether you buy them with isk or with plex the price is the pretty much the same in comparison between the ingame market and New Eden Store.
---
about fits: [zkillboard.com](https://zkillboard.com) if you check for specific type of ships being destroyed in high sec and you are able to differ pvp/pve, good or bad fit - you're well set. Or you can simply ask the community on reddit for a certain fit in a new thread.
---
Ohhh thank you for clarifying. It’s my first day on Reddit and i didn’t realize that.
---
Thank you for this excellent reply!
---
New combat mechanic's:
---
Missiles:  
---
Current ship velocity gets added to missiles, missiles loose velocity while turning.  
---
Drone formations:
---
1: high orbit speed, lower damage drones remote repair each other slowly.
---
2: normal orbit speed, normal damage.
---
3: Drones don't orbit they hover and deal increased damage.
---
AAR, please?
---
They do see increased player log ins for the short period, those who unsubscribed are still playing coz they still have Omega time left and those who came back its new stuff until they get bored. Lets look at the numbers next month or month after, you should see a sharp decline in number. But that’s only my opinion
---
400 IQ bait just got baited by single digit IQ bait.
---
Why start over with a new toon, extractors are $5 or 500m isk a pop,
---
I'm inclined to believe that there are a lot of things you don't realize.
---
Be sure to swap hardeners and drones for the rats your shooting.
---
That wouldn't work, people struggle so hard to not shoot a valid target. Imagine the headache if people had to be responsible for setting all their coalitions blues.
---
Cone still doing God’s work! 
---
I still remember being the FC for the group saving you guys from being evicted in that C2. You guys have gotten big and done a lot more since then.
---
When we landed on grid there were 4 titans, 'JinChen' was originally in a Revelation which was killed and he jumped back into the fight later with a fifth Avatar as we were extracting, but all 4 initially tackled titans were killed.
---
Ok. But the ones on the list are suitable for lvl 3 missions?
---
I agree that other games have such bars to raiding or PVP zones etc however they are not sandbox games, so for example in WOW players grind lower instances for gear before trying the latest raids and you used to need the latest PVP season gear to be totally competitive in arena or battlegrounds. EVE less structured with no level or gear caps etc. I suggest it should be totally possible for a small gang to drop into Null and do some hit and run not killing the big toys but getting a kill or two before they need to extract and the risk reward element is that you get it right you get out stay to long well its boson time.
---
Why don’t you spend some of that energy tying a synopsis of NS for this guy then???  Or perhaps you are just a troll too.
---
Except we can see there aren't more people logged in, that information is public facing.
---
I can't reasonably say that I have read or have seen much lobbying from highsec carebears and the isk / hr equation is clearly against high sec pve'ers. Are you actually referring to Null sec pve here? OP says highsec pve. OP is not challenging Low- (sec under low) pve.
---
Maybe I'm wrong, maybe there is a strong highsec pve carebear lobby but I admit, here on Reddit, I really don't see it - again the isk equation is quite clearly against highsec pve - mining and missions (with the exception of maybe level 4 burners?)
---
To the OP, yep play the game how you want. I find many of the opinions and arguments about high vs null, pve vs pvp to be largely prosaic and based on taste (while pretending to be otherwise).
---
Side note: all genuine kills, no alt whoring or stuff like that. Took me about 3 years.
---
I literally already did that and the OP thanked me for doing so, but your brain appears borderline nonfunctional so I get why you might not have used your full body function which includes things like your eyeballs.
---
I don't even know, I got one for free years ago, and it just sits where I parked it since then. https://zkillboard.com/kill/48430615/  
---
There's just always much better options available for whatever I'm doing at that time.
---
Every single newbro I come across asking for advice in explo/ pve/ mining my first question to them is 'what is your end goal?'. Making isk is pointless unless there's a grander plan. If the plan is to use the isk to make more isk I'm much less inclined to help than if it's 'building liquid capital to fund nabbing a section of null and building out our own mini-empire to fight other groups'. Or even 'to buy ships so I can find other people to shoot'. 
---
Let's take, for example, the eve casino dude. He used his immense wealth to bankroll a war which was an excellent use of his isk making efforts. Mega industrialists have always funded wars. 
---
The issue with a huge industrialist funded empire in eve, ala goons, is that there is no other superpower that can resist their hegemony. Significant problem when shooty shit is basically the only valuable thing within an economy.
---
This is awesome even though I don’t get the girl reference.
---
Pearl Abyss approves
---
They almost saved the 3rd avatar, it was at 25% armor, jumped up to 33%, INIT had to OH our torps :D
---
Not sure why people downvote this, he has valid points. This is a very stupid event even if it seems generous at first glance.
---
Omg you are right.  I am so sorry for my opinion.  Retract everything I said. I just realized you won Reddit and I’m dumb and you win.  My life is better now , thank you
---
lolol gotg renters what do you expect
---
Jesus.  Is 999 the max you can get?
---
Haha, yeah OP is just a normal reasonable person!
---
Some highsec players just want to play a space game and do some different shit, mine some shit, engage their brain, or maybe not, sometimes AFK, maybe build some shit or even fantasise about what a "Wetware Mainframe" might be capable of and build a space factory or some such thing... They are not thinking about other players other than as an aside ("wow what an interesting name that guy has! Hmm, what was I doing?")
---
Each to their own, if they give no thought to the "community" because they are knockin around solo, I have no issue with that.
---
I also apologize for having given you a reason to vomit more words, each with a complete lack of merit, onto this website and into the world.
---
Blackout is also a barrier for hunters and campers. My Corp is a small group in our own sov in null and we are surviving. We've had setbacks sure, but it doesn't stop us keeping up the good fight. Roaming goons fucked us first time around because of a 200 man blob that was deployed in our area. Shit happens. 
---
Anyone working null industry will need to work out how to protect themselves. I don't see that being an issue. With greater risk comes greater reward.
---
The risk comes from PvP, not from PvE though. As to crazy risk, low reward, the amount of time to turn a profit is extremely small, you can pay for your ship VERY quickly. That shows that the reward far exceeds the risk.
---
Eve is a sandbox. It allows all playstyles. Don't mind what the loudest minority are saying about your style. You will find there are many more advocating your playstyle who don't need to shout about it on reddit. Have fun with what you enjoy doing.
---
That's correct. The smallest symbol counts for 1, then 10, then 100, to the limit of 999.
---
You're patter's shite.
---
I’ve learned not to argue with the less intelligent, they drag you down and beat you with experience
---
just as a side note, parasitic legion live in curse (unless they moved and I missed it) and they are pretty chill dudes
---
neat
---
Got to the site before it despawned, sadly despawned while clearing last pocket.
---
Trigs never showed up, in pocket or on 1 AU D-scan.  System was a perimeter, level 3 invasion system.  A few in local combat probing trigs, so unsure if confirmed they don't warp into pockets or were elsewise engaged.
---
Yea I haven’t done missions in a while, but I feel that should smash lev3s, read up on the missions, go for speed and max LP rewards.
---
I wonder if CCP can increase the limit.
---
I'd it was dragon ball Z-tier patter.
---
There was a guy a couple of years back who did a full guide on WH solo'ing. He goes deep into all that's required including ratting, mining, hole control and builds and ships and POS'es. Can't remember his name but Im sure his guide is still around.
---
Your impotent fury pleases us though. So thank you &lt;3
---
You didn't read what he said, its all there in plain English for you to refer back to.
---
Impressive
---
That's why goons was crying when drifters came because only a handful of people was able to defend the empire.
---
Can you please show where the kill marks are, I can't find them.
---
[https://zkillboard.com/character/407278691/](https://zkillboard.com/character/407278691/)  
---
999 shit fits lol - Congrats anyway, not like I wouldnt kill them either.
---
Exactly. I'm also a pvper but I like to dabble in other areas of eve when I'm in the mood to chill. I'm seeing numbers down in alliance and corp when fleets are not running.
---
I mean, you were in a curse. Did you really need backup lmao
---
Link your zkill as proof lol
---
Awesome, wish I was there for that.
---
Fit? :)
---
command destroyers can not fit or use a MJD.
---
You seemed surprised you didn't kill anything, but it's rather normal. The majority of the ships there were procurers; they are cruiser sized ships so your bombs won't apply as well. They're also rather tanky when fit correctly. Around 80k ehp - so you would've had to apply well over double the total damage to kill them.
---
Additionally, bombs IIRC don't do uniform damage. They do more damage near the center, less as you travel outwards. There were quite a lot of ventures and because of size + placement, even some of those survived.
---
There is a reason when you hear about bombing it's always a fleet... if you want to hit targets like the one you went after, you kind of need 4-6 minimum, and even then you might need more than one run.
---
About your plan. Your original plan was to go and shoot all of the attackers. You found out we were contractually obligated to shoot it (which includes Init), you only wanted to change to "we just won't shoot you guys, and will kill it, but won't shoot Snuff or V0lta". This puts the operation at risk, and your leadership knows it.
---
You guys are neutral to both Snuff and V0lta, unless your leadership lied about resetting Snuff, which is entirely possible at this point.
---
The TTT treaty was signed off by Sister Bliss, so it isn't like you guys didn't know, just you guys pick and choose what you are going to honor from one week to the next.
---
Honestly, were lucky that they don't all vanish when you get kill 1000 - cuz CCP things
---
is factional warfare alive or as dead as many say it is? also do you make enough isk to support the pvp?
---
Praise Sansha Kuvakei!
---
500 plex will cost 2 billion isk a month. It took me 1.5 years to PLEX comfortably from Isk and I'm largely a highsec'er.
---
The easiest activity to make substantial isk - in high sec - is market trading.
---
they could if they added a new symbol for 1000
---
Great reply,  thank you for the feedback
---
That sounds like a lot of ships for a small gang.
---
What do all your hard tackle and brawling ships do when you're outnumbered or out-escalated?  Stay out of the fight or go in and die?  Seems like that would decrease rather than increase your engagement profile.
---
How is it fit?
---
You see, his ships are top tier
---
There's three vertical columns of small green thingies right in the middle of the ship.
---
&gt;*" I've already heard from friends who have had to leave that they felt it  was complete bullshit to get back after Christmas, only to find out that  they'd basically missed the SP to get JDC5. "*  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Oh look. Another "Someone else did something I didn't, CCP NERF this please its not fair" post.  
---
&gt;What the fuck is next? Do we all have to stop playing because you went afk?
---
Then you need to stop playing.
---
Ms. Gigx?
---
Nice one! Though Kinda wish we’d see Titans dying more often in the context of strategic engagements as well.
---
Congratulations. That’s a feat and a half
---
Get back to the Capella!
---
Personally I think that when that does happen there will end up being multiple baselines instead.   But it'll be split between those that use gunnery/missiles/drones and other major systems.
---
So instead of a just "everything" baseline, it's instead someone choosing what subset of skills their character would be speccing into.   Which seems a little healthier in my opinion.
---
Who is "Iron Crown"?
---
Not being sarcastic but qctually curious, never seen them anywhere before.
---
&gt;**literally all**
---
Message unclear, upvoted assuming well-constructed sarcasm.
---
so, logins are up but the amount of people online simultaniously are down.
---
this means one thing. people are logging in, then logging out very shortly thereafter - aka they aren't actually doing much/anything once they log in.
---
It looks like they had 11 fax for 16 supers, and I hear half of those came late.
---
https://fleetcom.space/battlereport/Lq3SXja6vSpEkMEeh
---
That is an impressive feat! Congratulations!
---
Fine. Then turn lowsec into small gangland, leave nullsec for the F1-pressing cesspool coalitions and prevent wormhole-space from turning into the new nullsec.
---
Market PVP is decidedly a thing. And just because a lot of MMORPGs contain it doesn't make PVP their main focus.
---
Bro you could've answered OP's question rather than type all these replies.
---
He's not in the US, minimum wage is much lower. Did you even read what he said?
---
Eh, people Will just get more rorqs with the money they would use for excavators
---
fitting skills? yes.
---
ehp/capacitor skills? no.
---
navigation skills? no.
---
you want better stats - train for it.
---
however, i don't think you should have to train just to be able to fill all the slots on a goddamn ship.
---
That’s literally the point. They aren’t worth it.
---
I got 40+ kills this month and I barely play and only run solo these days
---
You mean "A super umbrella that WILL jump on any gang that comes in your space even IF you only write in alli chat  while BEING in the standing fleet ANYWAY, BE in range for atleast 50 dudes  AND you allways have a cyno fit" as oppsosed to "hs police that comes after you are dead"
---
Maybe, but as i said, im alpha and still pretty new to the game. Also if u dont want the drake, id be more than happy to take it off your hands ;)
---
this kind of trash talk says nothing
---
MMORPGS are time consuming games that reward time spent in game with ease of receiving reward, that is the machine that keeps you playing, without such an element 99% of people loose interest.
---
Thats why they advertise you carriers supers and titans ( or Latest Tier gear in other games ) nobody is interested in having second best or playing on hours on end for risky 10k Isk.
---
&gt; I'm fairly sure I recall some Incursion waves (maybe also Sleepers) having significant alpha, but once the various different NPC weapon cycle timers take effect, as well as some get killed/EWARd, you don't need to rep the victim to full in 1 cycle else they then break to the 2nd volley. So that'd be a case where EHP is greater than rep dps.
---
&gt; Also the other way can apply, full rep power may take more than 2 NPC shot cycles (or portions of initial alpha stike from different weapon systems, i.e. they may land 2 lasers shots and 1 missile volley in between) to land for armour, so you need extra EHP, again unlike shield.
---
You aren't contradicting what i said. You actually confirm it. 
---
&gt;I did say MAR+SAR,
---
Ancil reppers don't work for pve because you need sustained reps not burst reps.
---
reason is asking is I've played in null most of my eve history, tried wormholes but never liked it. now that the blackout seems like it will become the new norm I'm looking for alternatives. Null is boring as hell with the new changes
---
https://puu.sh/DYmOq/5acba75968.jpg
---
&gt;current state of delve
---
&gt;exactly as we fucking said it would be.
---
so, how is this news?
---
I've spent a few days in Syndicate after the Blackout. The Orvolle / PF-346 is still hellcamped, as usual. Beyond that, it looks pretty quiet. The ice miners and mission runners that I typically see in the backpockets have disappeared. But there are a few explorers running around and hacking sites. The isk from relic hacking is quite decent, about 150m/hr for an experienced explorer.
---
Superb!
---
Personally I lack the skill-set to achieve such a feat, very impressed.
---
Not played eve for years and didn’t know this was a thing! Is this player kills?
---
FW is great, especially if you like solo or small gang stuff in smaller ships, frigs and destroyers especially.    It is a great way to improve your PvP skills without breaking the bank.
---
Sounds like something a spy would say.
---
Different name ... same bot :D good you dunked them into the ground :)
---
Who is the "we" who were contractually obligated?
---
Well, you were talking about the data on logins. If you were already logging in, chatting with people and getting active in space then nothing really changed for you; you were active before and active after. That doesn't really tell CCP anything.
---
For the people who didn't log in, or logged in but didn't undock, or logged in but stayed only a brief time in the game, there's probably a lot more useful data to be had from login and playtime data.
---
Well done
---
Sports car? Uh. I've now got this hog here.
---
Heh, I have been wanting to meme fit it and end its misery for the longest time, but it seems I won't. What's your ingame name so I can contract it to you? It is somewhere in Lowsec though, I thing Uemon, so getting it out of there will be interesting for you. In worst case you'll get the insurance money so that's still a win :3
---
After I maxed my explo skills I realized that Sisters Core Probes were overkill for most things, as everything just got scanned down at the 1au or 0.5au marks. Since then I almost exclusively use Sisters Combat Probes for explo, and it feels strangely satisfying to watch PvE ships, miners, and gas huffers dock up when my unarmed Cheetah shows up.
---
&gt; What about an industrialist in a Wormhole who doesn´t compete with anyone and simply offers a service (building stuff for his corp)?
---
They do compete with someone. If their prices are too high people will just import the stuff or start making it themselves. 
---
&gt;And there is plenty of players out there who just enjoy producing stuff, who would make more money by selling the mats directly, but they don´t care about max profit.
---
It doesn't matter if you are wringing maximum profit out of it. What you are saying here is the same as if someone flew frigates in fw and wasn't very good but didn't care if they died that wasn't pvp. How hard you try to win or how much you actually win doesn't factor in to if something is pvping or not.
---
&gt;Not everything necessarily leads to PVP. The will to shoot stuff is what is leading to PVP or having a competetive mindset in general.
---
Unless you do something with no competition from other players (IE you mine a belt in hisec with no one else there and do nothing with the ore) you are competing directly with other players for resources. Just because a battle is decided with words and money instead of bullets doesn't mean that it wasn't a battle. It just wasn't *your* preferred kind of battle.
---
Just remove the ability to use injectors for cap skills at all. Job done.
---
Is that why I'm getting dumber reading your posts?
---
Link your killboard so we can see how elite you are then.
---
Who hurted you??
---
Congrats dude that's hot
---
tbh what he's describing sounds a lot more like what pvp players do _way_ more often.
---
Can you still fit a normal cloaking device with alpha?
---
If so then exploration isn't the worst idea. Just cant warp cloaked.
---
Yeah my curse with a medium shield booster, no tackle, no resists against anything except just enough to tank the npc damage type in a low incoming dps anom?
---
Yeah I can't imagine anything going wrong there...
---
Good luck finding a group that big in hisec.
---
Try ganking anything cap+ in Delve and see how many you manage to kill. The answer is 0, you'll just get super dropped and you'll end up dead.
---
Uh, because they don't know if there is danger in the system?
---
I'm sure you don't think those people were saying nulls is literally empty of all threats, right?
---
So tiny.
---
No you cannot fit any cloak as alpha.
---
Okay but when people are lobbying for things like needing cynos or massively buffing inhibs or making blops cloaky, thru are lobbying for ganking being safer.
---
Its not that we're not impacted.
---
Its that, so far, we still managed to be less impacted that other alliances.
---
No, I meant what I said.
---
Wow does that name ring a bell. I think you're right my dude
---
I mean it increases our engagement profile as in allows for engagement of a greater array of targets. If people escalate before all our DPS is on grid, we would definitely disengage. If we thought we could take them on, we commit everything. 
---
We hit all the intelligence channels we can to work out if we've found a potential engagement to decide whether we hit it or not. We keep the majority of our gang out of dscan range initially. Good scouting is incredibly important. 
---
I'd call 4-6 ships a small gang.
---
And what percentage of those kills are noob mission runners? ;)
---
It's dangerous for your health to keep reading. Should put a quarantine warning up.
---
Even better - a special skin locked to ships with x number of kills
---
Yea. This guy is the best phantasm pilot in eve lol.
---
EVE has a shitload of paths you can go, everyone has his own goals. There is no defined endgame in EVE, you haven't won the game when you own a Titan. And yes, people who can't see a goal for themselves lose interest, what do you think why the player retention is so low?  
---
So take your WoW comparisons and fuck off, your dreams aren't other peoples dreams.
---
that's a lot of dedication mate. i can't keep myself from killing my phantasm once they reach 10!
---
Oh shit now that's a killboard worth jacking off to &lt;3  
---
I would however suggest using a stunt double phantasm for a while, since a bunch of people will attempt to bait it now.
---
I haven't been out there solo hunting for quite some time because last time I did I couldn't find anything but shit fits to fight either looking for hours I mostly stick to flying links and logistics these days.
---
Where the hell you find so many half fitted ships to kill?
---
get a work, working to get isk for plex suck you won't like the game
---
i just see a bunch of dead FAX, one of them died 20 minutes before the first titan, 4 right after. And if i read the comment by the other guy right 6 additional FAX would at best have saved one titan. so would a few more FAX have made a difference? yes. would they have tipped the scaled? dont think so.
---
unfortunately, it would be easily exploitable
---
They aren't really any different from Minmatar missions. Whack amarr, kick Caldari, that kinda thing.
---
You can always choose to decline those.
---
Man up and get going.
---
EVE is the darkest, most unforgiving universe you will ever walk through. This isn't some world of alliance/horde characters running around in wheat fields waiting for you to get half health and then ganking you, or playing school yard capture the flag in an arena the size of my bathtub. This isn't a world of open pvpers killing you and getting NO reward other than just killing you. This isn't a world where you have your hand held, guided on a wire, or spoon fed all of your equipment and skill.
---
This is EVE, a universe of cold, hard working, and merciless players. This is their world outside of the real, they are a mimic of the War Profiteers and Black Market monsters that effect everyone in real life today. They profit off of your misery, they make advancements by stealing yours, and they take your merciful attitudes, chew it up, and spit it out. But here is the best part: you will most likely mistake them for someone who cares.
---
Very nice!  I do love the Sansha ship line.  I was going to suggest you upgraded to a Fiend, although I see from the killboard you did that already, how many killmarks did the Fiend have when it went down?
---
Props for having a covert cyno on your ratting curse!
---
nerf /u/judas_II
---
If you're asking this many questions about it but now trying it out then maybe it's time to just jump in and give our a try.
---
It's alive and kicking, bit don't take my word, grab a few frigates and try it out
---
&gt; Props for having a covert cyno on your ratting curse!
---
&gt; burn a covert cyno up
---
why does nobody on this website know how to read?
---
Everyone I go out solo I come across ships that are the exact thing that will kill me..
---
Wouldn't even need a skin. Probably just a set of small generic overlays placed on each ship. Unsure what they'd have to do if damage appeared in that area of the ship though.
---
Can you tell me some other options? Domi ratting sucks and I don't have more than 1b isk for station trading.
---
He is based around a small lowsec area close to Jita that newbies tend to wander into randomly/by accident/due to a mission or similar. Makes it fairly simple, that way.
---
Kubinen/Enderailen/etc.
---
unless you plan on living in a single system all your life you will eventually have to take a gate, and even if you land on one safely after all the dscanning and warping to bookmarks you can skitt get 1 shot after you decloak on the other side...
---
Another dozen fax at the start of the fight would have given Iron Crown the advantage.  
---
Snuff probably could have escalated further, but as it was they didn't have to.
---
You only get a mark if you get the final blow
---
It's going to cost you a lot to extract all of that SP, then you will lost a lot of that when re-injecting. It's 500k SP to make an injector, but once you're over 5m SP you only get 400k SP back when using an injector.
---
It's final blows in PvP. 
---
https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/206403789-Killmarks-
---
It's a fun little mechanic that CCP should expand on (ie. include it in killmails for both final blow ship + victim ship). It doesn't really mean much, but it's the kind of thing that gets you more invested in your ships - it can really hurt losing that 1-200+ killmark ship that you had a special 'connection' to.
---
Downvoted for telling the truth lol.  
---
I probably wouldn´t brag on reddit about farming 10m isk shitfit caracals tho.
---
i mean, according to the AAR not all supers were on field from the start either
---
this guy gets it, but hey lets shit on OP because "CCPs dick is just too tasty"
---
Learning about these skills and their impacts on your ship is part of the learning in itself, so no. Direct players to these skills and get them to mix them in with fun skills. That way they learn the effects that the Magic 14 have, whilst learning other aspects of the game/skills
---
Oh I thought you like multi purpose fit it. Rats dont do much dmg in low level sites. You can probably do a neut pvp fit with a few adjustments and get away with ratting in their space and blowing up whoever lands on you.
---
I didn't mean to be toxic, just pointing it out, finding these dudes 999 times still is kind of impressive tho and tbh last time I went out frig sized I only found one of these 4 faction frigs I couldn't engage and shit fits either so there is that. I didn't roam in quite some time.
---
Okay thanks, I got and Idea now then :) Thanks for your answers.
---
I really do see the point in extracting your toon. 
---
If you REALLY need to reallocate some sp then chose carefully as you will only receive 80% of the sp you extract since you're about 5 mill sp.
---
Might be worth looking on the character bazaar to see if it's worth selling your toon and buying a new one if you really don't want to keep him.
---
Bomb damage depends on signature of the target - not "where" the bomb hits. As long as you're within 15km of the bomb, you'll take damage. The damage calculation is as follows:
---
Dmg=BaseDmg * MIN(signature/Explosion Radius, 1)
---
A corvert cyno on a curse..., well I never...
---
Is it against that ship you killed them with or against your character?
---
its called too many virginic wankers trying to look tuff on the internet. Its okay  there pvp paradise will come when its just them left to jack off to each other and CCP KILL THE GAME THE WAY FALCON IS GOING
---
I don't mean to be rude, but are you just one guy with a lot of alts saying the same thing?
---
&gt;get my blops, burn a covert cyno up
---
The covert cyno is on an alt, not on the Curse.
---
Real men hull tank their pods.
---
It's not easy to multipurpose fit the ship past the existing multipurpose. Has to be cap stable (and shield boosters are huge cap sinks), able to tank the rats, and have an escape if it gets discovered. That covers all the midslots. It has neuts, but no tackle and minimal tank. All the lows are ddas because without them the isk made doing this entire thing is horrendous.
---
Some time I wonder why people like PVP don't go to play other games, like battle royal stuff.  PVP of EVE: hard to engage, most time out numbered or waiting to out number others or nothing or killing people don't want to fight and shitting them on reddit after.
---
? when people throw them out with a support fleet people take notice and then they die like this, it's good
---
Its on the ship with which you recieved the killmail (killing blow), not counting shuttles and noobships.
---
i've got some good news for you then, the DAU can easily be higher while the game is absolutely empty since everyone is logging in boosting the imaginary number just to click "claim reward" then logging off since there is nothing else to do... keep sucking on that CCP dick while your game becomes extinct and you slowly realize how all those fancy stats they post mean jack fucking shit...
---
hs border close to school system
---
join the winning side and you can make 600+ mil an hour running FW missions 
---
i do one run in morning every other day which finances omega for 3 accounts and ships more than i need
---
Derp, I read that as burning a covert cyno, sorry.
---
Quoting Twain does not make you smarter.
---
That's ok. If the mistake is consistent among readers, it's my job to clarify it.
---
These rub out, and almost always before you can cap out a BS
---
Nah bro, the rorqual rebalance was definitely a PvP buff /s
---
It is impressive from a perseverance point of view.  
---
I would rather end myself then spend 3 years shooting shit fit mission runners that probably don´t even see me on the overview.  
---
He lost 13 ships **in the last 2 years**, and that tells everyone plenty about his play style. I guess some people find it fun the same way some people find running lvl4s or mining in HS fun. All those activities have the same risk factor anyway. 
---
Also, I think he used to do it in a Fiend but got dunked.  Guess he downgraded after that.
---
There are implants for scanning and hacking,..depending on your skill, especially in scanning, you may want to look at the lower cost implants.  Explorers die and their pods with them so keep the implant cost down ... risk vs reward.
---
Only 700ms? Bloody slow boi.
---
He isn´t wrong though ;)
---
Look I am in a small alliance the lives in null and we are not big carbing outside of mining the moons in the pocket. It has actually become safer to mine in the pocket there is no way for people to know we are there unless they check ADM. Hunters dont really bother with more normally empty areas anymore because there is no way to know if there is some one there without local.
---
Tears infused caramel... My favorite!
---
3, why?
---
I agree with you. The problem is people can do what I did, which is join a bloc, enjoy near unlimited protection and resources and in reality little work in return.
---
I'm an importer for my bloc. Its 90% of what I do. Import, refine, list locally.  My way of feeding the war machine.
---
Back when I was in a tiny lowsec Corp in Molden Heath we had to bust our ass just to get the POS up. That was the real fun. Problem is the super powers are so large and control so much that doing what I did then isnt competitive and at the time was being diluted by botting.
---
They did this before the blackout they will do it after. This isn't a CCP thing, just the alliance likes to use supers/titans as first level of escalation.
---
I never said people using mining drones were risk averse, I think it's the natural way to adapt.
---
Can I jump in on this and ask what a good dualboxing set-up would be? 
---
I used to use 2 strats but I was thinking cloaky ham Loki and neut strat
---
Damn you always use Beams! Did you ever use pulse?
---
Except of course you can save them. You can have scouts on your gates, you can spam d-scan, you can be alert and scoop them if any bombers decloak, you can fit drone navs to make it harder to bomb them, there's lots of recourse for you, it's just that none of them are 100% foolproof, and that's what you're not used to.
---
People would just farm it.
---
I wish the KMs were significantly larger
---
Or even cloaky ship outside of dscan range :)
---
Loki
---
the vast majority of his kills are newbros ;_; the poor vedmak with 1 hybrid rig and only 2 ABs in mids ;_;
---
If you're in a proteus, and a helios starts shooting you, he 100% absolutely has backup (either currently warping in or waiting to jump through a cyno). Pretty sure I would've booked it too, haha
---
That's really impressive man.
---
Yes, I checked a few of his last kills. That's why I'm asking.
---
r/eve 2019 unironically wanting to buff injectors for veterans
---
Now we've truly hit rock bottom.
---
Do you have slaves in?
---
Exactly. In my books the first thing to go should be character attributes. They're annoying even for my old characters, but new characters that have to train all types of skills are even more affected.
---
You go after afk ratters not paying attention.
---
How does this affect shared spaces like Delve?
---
Idk I feel like no matter how many shitfits you're fighting something will go wrong eventually. 999 is still impressive
---
https://zkillboard.com/character/1575035318/
---
Praise the lord that's awesome
---
Loki has range issues with hams, at least in c3 space anyways.
---
Laser Legion can kill the webbers that like to sit at 30k.
---
So you're telling me that you got 1000 kills in a row? Seems legit.
---
Damn turncoats!
---
War is not fought for profits, but for ideologies and territories! If you fight a war for profit, then know, all that ISK was earned with the blood of innocents. How can you join the "god said slaves are our right to take" side with a clean conscience?
---
You enslave our people, we free them. No matter, what the "winning side" is, we'll come for our people.
---
YOU on the other hand, are nothing more than an honorless mercenary that would sell his grandmothers soul to the devil if the LP to ISK conversion is high enough.
---
(Just to make sure, this is not about you personally, I'm trying to be in-character here.) ♡
---
dead titans
---
I don't know how are your colleges. Here all full theory and you only learn basics. You can't understand really anything with some theory of perfect market rules examples.
---
With the knowledge here, in Jita or other big markets you can really see REAL market, REAL offer-demand interaction, real econometric...  and no low scale easy to calculate data as you learn (here) in college.
---
Proteus can´t even kill pods....CCPlease :(
---
Now people will certainly start baiting him lol
---
it depends how fast you wanna earn your first roughly 2 bil ISK (yesterday 1,875 bil ISK), however your math is always actual plex price plus 30% so you have always some room for price spikes. A month, two or three months? If you do only mining: solo gas huffing in C4/C5/C6 WH's - doable, however finding such a wh as alpha in short period of time every day...the average income due time spend and actual grinding is low - so it's more likely to be opportunistic than actual non stop grinding.
---
Joining an wh corp who are doing moon mining with rorqual boost every single day. Here are the issues: finding such a corp and playing in their timezone, being invited to join them, you bind yourself to do pvp i.e. to defend your corp, and you need step up to a whole new lvl from ore mining venture to ore mining Rokh(roughly 220 mil ISK investment). Staying alive when s.o. tackles you in your Rokh.
---
Exploration - running relic and data sites, awesome yield to investment ratio, you don't need to kneel to anyone and there's plenty of quiet space to farm those especially in Renter regions of big powerblocks. Your yield is determined mainly by your skills + luck of hacking a container + staying alive.
---
You can also combine your earnings if you are already in a wh-corp. Mine gas + ore and do exploration. So at any given time you can simply switch from one activity to another.
---
Running triglavian sides is good isk, you can do lvl 1 either solo in a T2 fitted standard and faction cruisers or as a group of three in T2 fitted standard and faction frigates. The yield is good but you need some skills upfront. 
---
Ninja looting is opportunistic but brings you closer to your goal.
---
Salvaging after a carrier/supercarrier/titan pilot doing some farming - skill time is pretty quick the earning are a steady income, however you will be bound by a corp that also means you should be ready to do pvp.
---
Grinding by one activity is tiresome, spreading your income for diversion also described with the saying: "jacks of all trades and master of none" and contradicts what new players should do. In order to get high yield in one of activities you should concentrate yourself on a single activity, instead of getting diversify and have just average or even low numbers yield - at that point you will burn out and it will become a second job. With times skills and knowledge comes by, then you can and should diversify by doing other things.
---
TL:DR- I recommend to speak with recruiters of new player friendly corps(no SP requirements) who are not declined to accept alpha pilots(some will accept you if you have been playing for at least 30 days so you need to show some ingame activity i.e. try and error on zkillboard is a good point, not just only create an account and login after 30 days ). See what they are offering (free starting ships for pve/pvp ships, skillbooks, information, pve group contents, free of charge corp internal services, any other help), conditions of joining(pups= aka pvp participation, what are the limits what you can and can't do in given corp, taxes).
---
Upfront of joining I also recommend to create an new acc via friend invite link from one of the corp members you're joining. Since it gives you free 750 k SP.
---
Like the Seinfeld episode where the one character brags about how great he is in his martial arts class, then his friends find out he's fighting against small children...
---
Every time I try to get into FW space, I get killed by gate campers on my way there...
---
D
---
Those titans died just fine with the need of a anti-Titan rifter.
---
Nice job, but mmm... next time warp to a ping that in-line with your ship, not the opposite also make a multiple bookmark to make target guessing where you gonna pop up :)
---
Yes, plus perfect time to mess those statistics.
---
Seems like it might explain a few things...
---
My Merlin be locked by a BS at the speed faster than Drifters lock into BS, then I got one-shot
---
Oh, those guys, lol
---
:D
---
nope i dont use them anymore. Selfdestruct or podexpress is faster for reship
---
I was flying a crappy 200mm Auto Cannon Rifter fit because I'm kind of just trying to learn to PvP using FW. But the time I've attempted to even get into FW, its just locked down, I kind of hate it. Might just roam solo in my Loki, might be better off. Or fit up a decent cruiser instead of using Frigs.
---
Like i said before. If the ISK value of the PLEX its really low, the offer will be low. 
---
If before of the BO i was able to fit a NICE carrier, a nice Rattlesnake, nice pvp ship and now i can't get the hull for 20€ the offer of the plex will be low to zero and the price will keep high or maybe get higher than before. Just some people will left the game, some people will start paying real money for the monthly or other will find a way to earn enough isk to keep buying the plex with more playing time.   
---
You don't need 10 rorq accounts. Don't be so dramatic. A simple alpha explorer can do 200M per hour quite easy (one day will do 50M and the other 700M)
---
Ah, i thought both mattered. Makes placement less of an issue, at least.
---
I think the reason the ship looks like this is based on the IXS Enterprise, I.e. Alcubiere Warp Drive
---
Sounds like a bunch of free proteus kills then.
---
Congratz judas!
---
Aar
---
They're not here complaining because they're actually busy playing the game.
---
funny thing is, these are winter co titans and these days snuff is blue-ish to frat. Or at least they have access to winter co citadels.
---
I'm still pretty confused here.  What can you engage that you wouldn't be able to with a standard nano gang?
---
Blue donuts is bad ; botting is worst.
---
Yeah fun fact if you have HG slaves you have to bomb with 2x medium emp first and then 2x large proton, anything else and it doesn’t work cus of the resists
---
Not sarcasm, sorry buddy boyo.
---
Literall all.
---
Well when you live in a tiny player housing instance zone, with little to no reason for external tools, or communication channels, you have to spout your bullshit somewhere, and that somewhere is /r/eve for the wormholers and other irrelevant shits.
---
As everyone has said, it'll be such a chore you'll wonder why bother playing and quit eventually.
---
Having said that, join karmafleet. Go to the heaviest ratting systems with a salvager and bookmark every single anomaly. When the anomaly goes off the scanner, warp to it, drop MTU and salvage everything.
---
Industrial Fertilizer removes the need for crop rotations
---
That is amazing...as well as your dedication to being on every day...EVE autism spectrum at it’s finest and I personally am jealous.
---
Though I would normally not condone his actions he performs a vital role in the eve ecosystem, like a 16 foot crocodile that waits for the zebras at the river crossing the strong survive and the weak serve as a lesson. I am sure he has not caught everything that tries to pass.
---
Just keep in mind that the enemy has the same limitations. So a couple neuts would tip their shit over and you could always warp off if you need to. Also why do you need all your mids to tank low level sites? With a large battery and medium booster you should be golden.
---
The Salvare.
---
999 is pretty damn impressive regardless of shit fits or not.
---
But yeah, maybe not true "bringing solo back"! :-/
---
Could they make kill marks any smaller....
---
How many phantasm you lose on the way to this? Congrats on it
---
Eh he killed some much shootier shit too. He killed a Gila with it, which isn't too shabby.
---
Sadly, that appears to be a low estimate...
---
It was that, bear in mind it was when plexing an account was 800m / month
---
Medium Armour Rep, Small Armour Rep, no AARs mentioned.
---
Well observed
---
Mega LUL  [https://zkillboard.com/kill/77916687/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77916687/)
---
Bought plex two days ago... Fml. Would have been able to get so much more.
---
Oh I see what you're getting at, apologies. Basically anything that is a typical counter to kitey ships, we can still take on. If they have fast tackle up the wazoo coupled with brawlers we will still fight. A nano gang typically avoids those situations.
---
Tasty bait on a new alt coming up to kill said Phantasm with 999 KMS.
---

Solo PvP
---
The Aeon is beautiful how it is! Stop hull shaming.
---
Surely you can get a job, any job, clean a car once a week or whatever.  That'll earn you enough for a sub!  It's one hour minimum wage.
---
current missions have only included Gurristas and Gallente NPC-s.   
---
i guess its about time i read up on how to use drones lol
---
It's not about PvP vs PvE, most people do a bit of both. How do you think the mainly PvP players fund their losses? They don't live in megablocs that provice SRP. They probably have an incursion alt or a trader alt or an industry alt to make them isk and buy new ships to lose.
---
It's not even about "i live in nullesec" vs "i live somewhere else". It's that the richest area in the game has become the place with the smallest amount of risk. And that's killing both the game's economy and the content.
---
As for "why should they kill my big stuff with their small stuff", well, in order to keep things dynamic and interesting, in a rock-paper-scissors kind of way. Also, it's a multiplayer game. You're not supposed to be able to do every single thing by yourself.
---
Same as in the real world really. You don't see battleships or aircraft carriers sailing alone, they have a ton of escorts around to support them. You don't see armor pushing into cities alone because they will get wrecked by man portable anti-tank rockets, they have supporting infantry with them to spot threats and guard them. Even in other games (both computer and tabletop), you don't have "one size fits all" solutions, because it's simply bad game design for games that you are supposed to play with others. You don't see wizards rushing into combat by themselves, they sit back and cast their magic spells while a fighter/tank protects them and a healer is on standby. If one class can do everything, then everyone will only play that class and the game becomes too boring to play.
---
The majority of games (both fantasy-based and those that try to emulate real situations) have some variation of this asymmetric gameplay, because it's simply good game design. If you don't have that, everyone plays the same way and the only way to win is to +1 (bring more people) and it's boring. If you have asymmetric counters though, you can just bring different stuff instead of having to bring more of the exact same stuff to a fight.
---
So no, EvE is not the only game where people like to bring smaller stuff and expect it to have an effect, it happens in loads of games. But EvE has become (during the last few years) the only game where certain people think they should be untouchable because they injected into the biggest ships available. Well, that's contrary to basic game design principles, it makes games boring to play and it kills the playerbase. Sure, some people will unsub because of the changes. But some others will resub thanks to them. Overall, if the shakeup makes the game's foundation better in the long term (even if there is an initial adjustment period and drops in activity), i'm all for it. People who dislike this will leave, people who like it will come back and we'll be more or less at the same activity levels. So, we might have the same amount of players, but with an important difference( if they succeed): we won't have so much of a broken economy anymore and we will be able to use more ships in more ways, than just using the biggest (slowest and most boring) ones every single time we want to accomplish something. That's a win in my book even if some people move to other games, as long as others come back to replace them and/or it makes it possible to retain new guys with a bit more success.
---
Hey HellerN, you up for some docking action? ;)
---
insurance money case is a good one still. worst case scenario is me dying on route to it lol
---
HURT THEM WHERE IT REALLY HURTS SO THAT THEY GET KILLED TO DEATH
---
That was pretty close to the fit I used a while back for level 3s when I was a mission runner, and I had zero issues. It won't handle a level 4 without warping out a few times, but on a level 3 it won't even break a sweat. I was alpha at the time also, so meta 4 the turrets and drones. (If I remember right, I don't even think I had rigs)
---
What would be the recommended price for each wash?
---
Needs more red arrows.
---
1. Lowsec near starter system
---
2. Spring out from under your bridge when you hear newbros trip-trapping on d-scan
---
3. club them into killmarks
---
...and that is how i got to 113 kills with a Reaper. By 'skill set' you probably meant 'character flaws'.
---
I doubt they ever accounted for anybody ever getting that many with a single ship..
---
Docking request accepted ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

All pve makes you pvp content so look how terribly wrong that post is.
---
Or just introduce skill loss to every ship in eve not just t3c this would help reduce highsec ganking also
---
Oh yeah, look at it with the Fiend.

Wormhole space people have being risking this for years with less reliable logistic chains for years with no crying
---
PVE in Eve is an illusion. 
---
Players who consider themselves a "PVE player" in Eve are mistaken.  Sticking to high sec only reduces the chance of engaging in PVP, it does not eliminate it.  So, there's a certain degree of contempt for players who fail to recognize this.  
---
These "PVE only" players cargo-hold-tank their industrial or mining ships.  Or autopilot in something expensive.  Or take freighters with multiple billions in cargo from Jita to Amarr without a webbing alt.  Or make any number of other mistakes based on their false assumption.
---
These players are not only simply "wrong" but often have no interest in learning or taking the steps necessary to protect themselves.  Many view these players as stupid for failing to see reality and too intellectually lazy to educate themselves.   
---
They want the game to be "fixed" to more closely resemble what they thought Eve was before someone dropped a hammer on them and left them with a severe case of cognitive dissonance.  
---
Any decent PVP player can easily and safely engage in PVE because they understand the mechanics behind the PVP it would take to kill them.  "PVE only" players, even the ones who "look up" how to do their chosen PVE safely, will simply be less competent at surviving in Eve.  
---
If, for example, you are serious about shipping cargo in freighters, it would be wise to seriously engage in freighter ganking so that you will understand, first hand, what goes through the mind of gankers as they decide who will be their next victim.  Reading about it in the Eve Uni Wiki or taking forum advice will not give you the same level of competence.
---
ok get this, what about, a naga with CAPITAL GUNS so u can mow down those blobbers
---
not sure how to balance it tho
---
You're a weird fucking dude
---
Sorry i got MAAR and MAR mixed up. That still doesn't change the fact that undersized reppers don't make up for the lack of repping power. And still consume low slots. How was that supposed to even make sense? 2 reppers don't out pace a single oversized repper so add undersized reppers to compensate what kind of logic is that?
---
Seems like they for the first time in years know what they are doing
---
So even ex long time provi members just want to shoot provi.
---
Wait, people are flying Rifters again? And they kill Rorqs?!? That's great! Eve is moving the right direction!
---
Nice job!, what is your fit?
---
&gt;  some people actually join this game for pve,
---
I'm actually fine with guys who only want to PVE. What bugs me is when they move to dangerous space and complain it's not safe. Concord freaking warns us that is the case as soon as you jump through the first null/LS gate. It's those guys I dislike.
---
&gt; mean, you laugh but this game will be at an all time low player count within the year
---
I would honestly rather see the game shut down than become a land of safe PVE. I get it that some people neither want the risk or the PVP experience. There are games for those playstyles.
---
Eve wasn't one of those games and should not be.
---
Thanks, Bud!
---
Contract's up. Just travel there in a corvette, they're free, just spam the warp button so that you don't get podded if you get caught. Or get a shuttle. Bring a couple of warp core or inertia stabilizers so that you can travel fit the ships you want to get out.  
---
Also, do not warp small ships directly gate to gate in lowsec if you aren't alone in local, smartbombers might be waiting, and learn to use dscan.
---
&gt; What VNI changes?
---
No more five heavy droned but now they get gun and rep bonus. Basically, they're not efficient at AFK (because they'll still be find if you're active).
---
HM Loki or laser legion are all pretty ammo efficient
---
Use [http://evemaps.dotlan.net](http://evemaps.dotlan.net) to find backdoor routes with little or no kills. NPC nullsec is quite easy to to get to.  
---
Alternatively, you can use [https://www.eve-scout.com](https://www.eve-scout.com) to find a wormhole to Thera, and then travel from Thera to null sec.
---
Good, remember to swipe the white goo after showing off your elite pvp donk
---
PVE is boring, too. Why bother playing at all?
---
Risk. Unlike most other games, you actually feel the risk in this game. You don't respawn and pay a vendor pennies to repair your stuff, you might lose everything and have to start all over again. It's that blood pumping feeling that keeps me here. No other game I've played gives me the adrenal rush of this boring ass game.
---
Huh... second dread-drop in under a week, and both of my lost dreads were insured... usually my insurance expires. I do like this new development.
---
&gt;It's almost like excavators are now some type of risk vs. reward system, wtf
---

Virginity secured :sunglasses:
---
Except for the derogatory tone, yes. I dont think WHs can become NS so that shouldnt be an issue but lowsec is in terrible need of an overhaul. So is HS as well honestly and I would start there because thats the most important place in the game. Its the starting zone and its really crap, no guidance and too much complexity. 
---
Then fix LS, make it viable for groups to live there and give them a reason to fight. But forcing LS and WH to go to NS for content, that worked a couple of years ago. Today its gonna be uphill no matter what.
---
Can you draw cap from an opponent's drone with a nosferatu?
---
What can rise down even mean?  I am getting so mad thinking about this.
---
15% more!
---
I think you got that backwards, the fun and games start when someone lights a cyno.
---
TLDR: Frat+botters get dunked by #1 lowsec droppers
---
For the ham loki to work you’ll have to use javelin missile for some rats that orbits at 30km
---
If you wouldn't just kill newbs I would be impressed.
---
I think it's great, but I HIGHLY RECOMMEND you join a player-owner fw Corp.
---
solo pvp is dead subcap ratting is dead people without umbrella either go to wh or get broke
---
So about 5 years into EVE I started making "10 Year Plans" (hardy har har Communism joke) because I was out of things I wanted to train. I could fly all the ships I wanted, all the weapons I wanted, etc. At this point I'm just being a completionist and I had spec'd my stats to that type of skill to Level 5 all non-Titan ships.  
---
TL;DR: I was bored.
---
Oh, I am not saying it’s impossible to have a chance, only that it’s my guess that most multibox Rorqual players will either opt out if excavators or feed them like a mad man till they either learn or leave.  They are drawn to a low APM gameplay that revolves around having a low chance of getting the excavators lost.  
---
Time will prove my view right or wrong.
---
Walking in stations.
---
They should have made 100 just make your ship turn into a fuckin flashing beacon of killmarks
---
Easiest and most efficient way to omega (if you're not poor) is to go to eveonline.com, go to account management, and subscribe the account. Even at minimum wage, its about 2hrs worth of "work", as opposed to the next-best alpha option of exploration, which would still be deep into double-digit hours
---
Ok
---
Man Im so glad there are people like you with so much insight into CCPs data collection. You are the watchdog our community needs.
---
Sadly this is out Intel channel.

---
Imagine PIRAT coming on here smugging about their kb and raking in upvotes like this choob...
---
Farewell sweet sides
---
A bit closer to 3h probably, assuming your cyno doesn't get podded all the way home along the way :/ And you'll use about 50m worth of fuel. So yeah, if you aren't that short on cash, just jump it to the most populated nearby system and put it on contracts for a fair price.
---
T2 Attack Battlecruisers could be cool maybe
---
* No siege requirement, Anti-Cap gun bonus only. Has siege bonus built into the hull but only 1 turret hardpoint each so they deal 1/3rd of the DPS of a Dreadnought.  
---
* Low sig and mass for a BC to help them evade heavy capital DPS, but also little/no T2 resists (similar or worse to dictors at most). Same HP as base attack BC and same slot layout So other subcaps rip them apart no problem. The idea is it's pretty hard to clear them with anti-cap titans/dreads. 
---
* 400m a pop for the hulls, slightly less than a CS hull in build requirements but that's to count for the cost of the anti-cap weapon. Generally this means that 3 T2ABCs cost about and do the same DPS as a Dread, so they aren't more cost efficient and are less pilot efficient, but the ability to use them with stukas/wormholes gives them good application for surprise ganks and traps that dreads can't.
---
Well at least the afterburner**s** are the right size.
---
haha look at me im doing the greentext im so cool right leddit haha
---
You are not a smart man.
---
3 different SP daily events, 3 month free MCT with sub, and now 15% of PLEX.  Someone really wants metrics to look successful, hmmm.
---
Seems to be a common pattern with Init.
---
Aeon is best ship
---
Buying PLEX is only worth it when you're already spacerich.  Trying to chase the mythical "free sub", especially as a new player, will leave you with no time to actually play the game and you'll hate it.
---
Fuck, this cuts deep.
---
Brags about the legitimacy of his kb, within about 5 minutes people start linking some of the shittiest fits this sub has ever seen.

It's shitfit to all hell use a shield boosted one
---
You can do a WH solo but I it is never recommended.
---
A WH with HS gates always gets you visitors in. Plenty of them. You also want to make sure to keep your supply up. You NEVER go alone (as with just one toon) or you can lose everything. You always leave a scanner alt logged off in there in case your main is toast and you have to find the way back.
---
So, a blob of nagas with cap guns... O\_o'
---
Pretty low hanging fruit you pick, from what your kill board says..
---
Shame on you
---
Yes =\]
---
The comparison is MAR+resists vs MAR+SAR vs MAR+proposed-lowslot-probably-as-strong-as-an-aux-nano-pump. MAR+SAR is a currently available thing, that is a way to use a low slot and give more effective rep power than resists (if you're min-maxing for that and not also EHP).  
---
How would the proposed slot really differ than an undersized repper, other than using a little less cap &amp; maybe less PG but more CPU? AKA have you explored all the currently available tools for such fits before suggesting this new module?
---
To be fair, it was 50/50 as to whether local would be working before the blackout...
---
&gt;  I sense some frustrations
---
stop projecting.
---
 The noctis is pretty useless. Give it the ability to scan wrecks and give it a much needed buff.
---
Yes, give CCP your credit card info.
---
Is that sarcasm?
---
But you didn't get any bad spawns whilst running 100 T5. Seems pretty low risk to me.
---
Whatever the names, they were counter-dropped onto pvp setup seemingly attempting to gank a ratting super (no comment on that super, though). As in they were cught PvPing, not farming =\]
---
What exactly was not possible without Blackout in this story?
---
Its more like you set an fps cap so the clients dont all try to get the max fps possible
---
this is the reason why people laugh about nullbloc players.
---
Nothing, they just like to falsely claim this is only happening due to no local. Anyone with a brain knows it to be not true.
---
How about no
---
Wowsers. I'm genuinely confused as to how somebody can go through all the effort and time to fly a vedmak but not know how to fit a ship...
---
Because of an opinion on a game? My salary says otherwise you absolute neckbeard.
---
Where your addrenaline super spikes during some eve pvp engagements.
---
Yea. And if you succeed CCP will will start nerfing your play style. Sandbox!
---
Yes
---
I'll reply to this post but I think it's the top voted.
---
I can't put a number on it, but yes a great number are crappy kills. No point denying it. 
---
But eventually I just wanted to get max killmarks and stopped caring about "quality" kills. I encourage everyone to set the same goal for themselves and see how far they get. I've reached my goal and I can now put this ship to rest.
---
A lot of T2 ships and modules like cynosural fields are locked behind the magic 14 as well. I am all for ways to get new players the magic 14 a bit faster, but only through ways that require them to actually play the game (like a new storyline arc or something).  
---
What EVE doesn't need is new characters that can use interceptors and cyno fields the minute they are created.
---
Why are you lying to OP about bomb mechanics?
---
what type of category did you use? stuck character?
---
What's the problem with the Rorqual now? Losing the expensive drones?
---
That means even less risk and therefore more profit for multiboxing fleets.
---
The trend goes away from afk ISK towards actually working for profits, so I guess this will remain a dream.
---
i'm not sure i know of an organization called "pandemic" could you please explain what you mean
---
NO
---
Why the fuck would it being in dscan range matter if it’s cloaky
---
Or just bring both? Did you inject all your sp or something
---
What problem are you even pretending to solve here?

---
Yeah maybe I need to just home out of LS, the issue is, I'm usually play out of a WH to do PI then go an roam around in LS/NS to look for fights.  
---
But after I finished winning EVE for about 6 months, and just recently came back I decided to play, I decided I wanted to get into FW. I might just have to make a FW alt and only sit in LS and have my main in WH making money and hunting in WHs idk. I do have a toon working on a tengu/caldari cruiser/frigate setup but it's alpha so I don't really wanna sub it right now, but I just might.
---
a few signs that this will be a fun thread:
---
op is in warped intentions
---
op barely has 400 kills
---
thread starts with the word theory craft
---
How about just add captcha to an alpha login and force logout at 12 hour session.
---
Doesn’t solve the alpha mass bot problem completely but I’ll bet it makes a huge dent.
---
You mean give her a special place in your heart where a georgeous ship like this belongs?
---

I'm surprised that there aren't more seboed long points or cloaky t3s out after I've been bombing active ops

Mate..."crappy kills"? You spent the entirety of this "achievement" skulking the fringes of starter systems ambushing newbros who stumbled through the wrong gate. You knew EXACTLY what you were doing.
---
I could ride down the road with my mouth open and I'm sure within a year or two I'd catch 999 bugs in it. The real question is why the fuck would I go on the internet to brag about that.
---
No. If you try and get Omega for free you will only burn yourself out and become another statistic.
---
I'll shoot whatever if I'm getting paid.
---
Man someone give that guy a medal. If you see Avatars dying and still jump in yours you are a true hero
---
Wew these comments are vicious. I dont agree with these proposed changes either but damn lol
---
Why are alliances afraid to fight when everyone is richer than ever?
---
Pandemic Horde / Pandemic Legion. I forget which one :p
---
Who the heck cares. Where is your 999 kill mark phantasm?
---
No you couldn't. 
---
How do you stop neutrals flying through in highsec? Bubbles? Shoot them? 
---
lmao.
---
wow how do you think this would work into BLACKOUT??

His kb is not only not "worth jacking off to", it's an absolute fucking disgrace.

What I got from tryng pvp in FW is a bad experience. You either get blown because the other guy has a 200m faction frigate, or he was a bait for their gang members to come. I would join in FW with a corp and go around in a small gang, not solo.
---
Did someone piss in your coffee this morning?
---
hey, usually i'm strictly against this test policy to just call all chinese players (on TQ) botters, but a name like "After Changed" that was clearly generated by some kind of random generator makes my eye twitch a little
---
What ever you take, take less from it or share some of it.
---
So you are against salt if you dont like it. This is consistent with something.

It's a fucking mmorpg, it requires active subscription, it has a vanity shop, it's THE SAME SHIT!

2 Large reppers with 4 enams 582.

2 Large reppers with 3 enams and a medium repper 677.

2 Large Reppers with 4 enams and a nano pump 699.
---
2 Large reppers with 3 enams, a medium repper and a nano pump 812.
---
I think this makes a sufficient demonstration of the power of amping the repping power vs just adding more repping power. That's not even counting the fact that 2 large faction reppers, 1 medium faction repper and a large nano pump are 22x more expensive than the 1 faction X-L shield booster, 2 shield boost amps and 2 adaptive invulns. AND THE SHIELD DOESN'T TAKE UP ANY OF THE DAMAGE MOD SLOTS.

He's jealous he doesn't have a 999 killmarks ship
---
&gt; I could ride down the road with my mouth open and I'm sure within a year or two I'd catch 999 bugs in it. The real question is why the fuck would I go on the internet to brag about that.
---
Because this is reddit. I've set an objective and I've reach my objective. As I said, I encourage everyone to try the same. Pick a ship and I'll see you in one year, ok?
---
How about a super capital sized version on a rorq, but the panic module turns the thing into Voltron and it starts smashing enemies with a giant sword for the duration.
---
Sounds WAY more fun!
---
My dude if you caught a thousand bugs in a basket hanging from your driver's side window r/cursedimages would probably trade you 10k karma for a photo of it.
---
Is there a favored fitting for a Legion? I love that boat and are slowly making my way back to EVE
---
Yep that's it. I don't intend on undocking it often anymore though :-)
---
Yeah there are people who are confident and using them.
---
Agreed on the HAM Loki issue. Laser Legion sounds intriguing, do you have a fit?
---
Whaa you are so lame buddy, are you a miner? If yes please calm down.
---
Well can you link a good one then? Let's not waste this half a chub I got from all those shitfits.
---
Imo yeah. Dual rep dual neut ham legion is pretty fucking silly for ganking in wpsace. It's pretty "full commit" with only 3 mids (mwd, cap booster, scram) but it can take silly amount with some bling, and do ~800dps heated. Imagine a brawl strat that's better on every level by like, two times.
---
I do bring both, level 5 signatures still require core probes, and while not *necessary* for level 4s, they still speed things up a lot.
---
For level 3s and lower I haven't noticed a meaningful difference between combat and core probes with my ship fitting and sp.
---
Pick a spot near the accessory activity you intend to pursue.  One asteroid type is about the same anywhere.  If you're not a nomad, then you might as well start getting improving some blueprint.   The rank of the blueprint isn't shown, but it strongly affects the research, copying and invention time. [[more info](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Research#How_long_does_research_take.3F)]  You may immediately notice that mining crystal blueprints are quick upgrades.
---
In general, tech one just doesn't sell unless there are no alternatives, and the margin will be awful.  To get into invention, you'll want your production operations to be nearish to a market hub.  Every hub except Jita is in decline because :ccp: is too lazy to take their finger off the scale, so base a tolerable distance from there. 
---
People buy goods based on the availability of complementary goods, so again, a hub is going to be the best place to flog hulls or anything.
---
The best places to refine, research and build are going to be in player built structures, so you'll have to spend some time in the structure browser to see what's nearby.
---
Nothing in EVE is really a solo activity, so join a social group.  Public mining fleets might be a good option.
---
Be aware that mining is some of the worst isk in the game, both for a new player or an experienced one.  It doesn't scale like other activities, it doesn't offer any windfalls, and the SP doesn't translate into anything useful in conflicts later on.
---
Sure thing. I should punch out a thousand toddlers then chestbeat about my undefeated fight record. What a proud proud accomplishment...
---
The premise in your first paragraph is so wrong and stupid that I stopped reading there.
---
Go die in a hole or something (in game).
---
Yeah all those ideas don’t work as well as you think and imma need you to just sit down.
---
1. Scouts on gates don’t work, they cyno in from a cloaky alt that’s been in delve for months.
---
2. DScan does not show the cloaked bombers flying towards you
---
3. Excavators are slow and unless you are on a small rock, the bombs will land before you can scoop them, even with drone navs. 
---
If people want to use excavators, that’s fine and it’s on them but it’s far easier to just set the miner 2s and then go focus on your super ratting
---
Your "objective" apparently to be a PIRAT- grade cancer on the game. Congrats, you did it! You'll excuse me if I set loftier goals.
---
or a *Trottel*
---
Yesterday I saw a bunch of Svipuls orbiting rorqs named "fuck your bombs" probably sniper and defender missile fit.
---
The minute people started using 3rd party tools to parse information from ingame is the minute they should have shut that down. They don't allow 3rd party modifications to the client, but you can use a 3rd party tool to scrape data from multiple clients and create a regional intel network to ping people when danger is close. It's a mistake they should have never allowed and now they are correcting it.
---
how many pizza pockets does 999 killmarks take
---
HS mining group?
---
Can i have more info? I have done null ratting, lv4running, PI. Id like trying another stuff. The last mining ship i have use are retriever... 5 years ago.
---
Cause you all sound like brats mad that someone else has a fun toy and daddy won’t buy it for you. The rorqual works the way it does because the excavators that are unique to it cost a fortune
---
Neither. Fly a battleship for C3’s or C4’s, and tinker battleships or leshak’s/Nestor’s or dreads for C5/C6. C2 and below not really worth doing
---
I am still mad you killed my blinged out [myrmidon](https://zkillboard.com/kill/33172600/) in 2013. I was brand new. You monster. (congrats on the 999 though)
---
Or maybe he tried google translating an actual phrase from Chinese and the result just sucked?
---
Yeah but those noobs can’t rat in a super or Titan so it’s fine.
---
The double-AB-no-tank fit really is the height of Vedmak fitting.
---
So your idea is to take the nigh-invincible, OP mining ship, and make it better by removing what little vulnerability it does have?
---
TBH they seem a lot tamer than this idea deserves.
---
So let me get this right, you want a change to the Rorq where it can still mine like the current  Rorq, has the dmg output of a dread, AND can use a module that gives it invulnerability? Are you smoking crack?
---
a lot of paths that require different levels of time or isk
---
who said anything about a Titan ? there is industry, trading, hauling, that require a lot of time patience and stability.
---
Other paths require far less time or isk even doing PVP
---
Talking about owning a Titan just proves your ignorance, it's people like you that are a plague to the comunity, that think they know what other's desire or what it is best for them.
---
Move in Highsec Testie and prove me wrong, go and try for yourself what you preach to others while you sit in your safe pocket farming in a super for the next T3 roam.
---
This is excellent advice OP
---
People always say that shit for decades. And so what.
---
cool keep us posted!
---
&gt;calling 2.5b a fortune  
---
i wonder who of us really has issues affording this "fun toy"
---
Then you have nothing to complain about
---
cuz everyone is a bitter vet
---
upgrade to a cap, that won't get shit on by roaming gang because your answer will be "here's a cyno, which has a whole fleet of titans ont he other side - eat a dick".
---
alternatively, fit that cyno on a rorq
---
alternatively, run abyssal sites.
---
alternatively, run incursions.
---
alternatively, start setting up passive income sources like SP farms, reactions, production, etc.
---
Yeah most of those ways don’t really work in delve, the size of the rock is really the only determining factor on if you can use excavators or not. 
---
The yield is not worth the sheer amount of effort to 100% being vigilant on multiple screens and relying on others to also be 100% awake as well. It’s easier to relax with miner 2s and just have fun talking with people in theta or in corp.
---
yeah im definitely going to fit an astero and mess around with some exploration missions
---
I'm not arguing that what you're saying won't happen, I just think that's ok. The hegemony of supers remains with or without the blackout, so it's better to have the black out since more people are enjoying the game and resubbing because of it. The game is alive again, my man!
---
appreciate the advice
---
&gt;Thats why they advertise you carriers supers and titans ( or Latest Tier gear in other games ) nobody is interested in having second best
---
literally what you said you fucking moron. also get flairbaited.
---
Ur bad and u should feel bad

Which Voltron? The 5 Lions one or the 35 cars one?
---
Whoa this guy is one dumb plantpot

What are you doing? I kept trying low sec anoms and while fun to run the rewards were abysmal.
---
So you just want to make them useless? I mean that’s fine I guess but if rorquals disappear, I expect many people would truly quit after watching all their hard work patched away.
---
because we are missing useful attack tools like:  
---
- scoopable + stacktable inhibitors  
---
- system wide offensive cynojammers (aka command ship, jamming module in style ESS)  
---
- no possibility to raid enemy space and get any good reward  
---
- even attack module which disable local is gonna be much better fun (and with KM)  
---
- some more things can encurage attakers and create some fun, but CCP capability is just turn off local...  
---
- anticapital focused bombs, antifighters ECM burst or many kind of new fun modules can be created...
---
Want me to write everything you can do in the game so you can find out ?
---
Just making sure and no to the alts question.   Not trying to be a smart ass and I was speed reading it.   :P
---
dude how fucking stupid are you, you would literally prove my point with that.
---
Nothing, but it certainly feels easier to make this stuff to happen. With local around it felt like anyone ratting would just insta dock if a neut came in the system.
---
Life must suck for you
---
Well considering most patches/nerfs are directed towards us, yes we do believe ccp is out to get us. Hell, ccp ignores obviously broken ships like Kiki’s and Muninns that every other alliance uses for small gangs and doctrines. Now that we are gonna use them, the nerf bat will follow shortly after. It’s happened multiple times before.
---
PL were abusing a jump clone mechanic to be able to go from the home system to npc delve in minutes without timers to be able to drop delve all the time. We reported this but the response was “working as intended.” This went on for about a year before we decided to just do it back to them. The mechanic was patched out of the game after about 1 month of goons using it.
---
The drones cost less you retard
---
Totally new and original thread.
---
Think about what you said- you have an example of a non paying user, as your argument for why ccp should care about those players... *Because* they don't pay with money.
---
/Facepalm
---
I'm going to make the radical argument here that ccp needs paying subscribers more and that they rightly don't give a shit about carebears who are "always ratting for PvP"
---
Already done , and i think i have already explained it . But it's more to people who speack about some stats and ask me where i find history to make some graph. And link to people more of 30 link is boring.
---
So they both buy Plex and rat to make money, eh?
---
Sounds like a retarded person tbh. Typical nullbears excuse.
---
Gotta link?
---
https://i.imgur.com/FHVsqGP.jpg Maybe we could do an exchange
---
You do'nt know what about you are speacking.
---
You just troll .
---
Middle of the cluster? Do you know what anoms look like? No one sits in the middle, you park next to the rock you like and moving doesn’t really take long. When we talk about travel time we mean cycle time for the drone to mine and drop off the ore to the ship. Excavators are slow but bring in a lot, miner 2s are fast but bring in less. It’s about 50% on average of an excavator in the long run
---
Rifters already solo kill Rorquals, didn't you read the other thread? 😅
---
I have a nemesis I like to use with full sebos + auto targeting, etc mods on it. To lock fleets of bombers up so they can’t cloak. While the rest of the fleet does the tackling. Quite fun
---
I can't be the most retarded of this game beacause you are here and you are unable to read.
---
People who said spell check just use it ase ultimate argumentation in this reddit.
---
It avoid they to find fact, proof and other.
---
it's almost like this happens every time there's a sale.
---
Really? Then why does my Alliance have no issues getting the data?
---
When you undock in low wh or null you create content, people can shoot you. Hi sec carebears do not provide content their shitty afk playstyle is not contributing anything to the sandbox. On top of that they live in the risk free easiest region in the sanbox keep crying and asking for nerfs to bumping and ganking and pvp in general. They make the game boring and stale and should be extermined.
---
wow that is amazing!. congrats!!!. :3 whats the fit on that baby?
---
Only proves that you lurk this sub and shitpost a lot...
---
Just because you don't have anything better to do than post all day does not mean you are right for everyone else.
---
The middle of a cluster of asteroids if you can. 
---
I know what travel time is.
---
So you agree with my estimate of 50% of the yield of Excavators.
---
What was the point of your post?
---
It's very common for chinese people to just throw in a random phrase they found on some packages/webpage, or to just use poorly translated phrase. What would you do if you had to name your character with a different alphabet? Probably the same.
---
4 EANMs is never going to happen, you'd have 4 specific hardeners, and/or a RAH and DC2 for how they stack.
---
As for armour tank balance, they get webs, painters, scriptable TCs without giving up tank, which I'd say is better than stacking another damage mod in a low.
---
&gt; As for armour tank balance, they get webs, painters, scriptable TCs without giving up tank, which I'd say is better than stacking another damage mod in a low.
---
Not for PVE its not.
---
You forgot Delve!!
---
I can't for the life of me understand why you're so coy about which alliance you're in.
---
I don't said it's impossible. Really learn to read. I ask CCP to merge in one source to avoid to spend time to go to all source.  It's all so it permit to people who want exploit data to don't ask and just go to the unique source.  Yes i have all data myself, not hard, just a shitons of link. It's why i think could be cool if CCP in MER raw data make a page to resume all. 
---
So yes you proof again you haven't understand the purpoise of the post.
---
Only they didn't dock up. Killboards prove that.
---
Something something it's legacy code tied to corp bookmarks ammount...
---
Oh get out of here.
---
&gt;starts off by the bait guys catching a Nyx ratting
---
Unless they blue tackled it, this is basically impossible without the blackout assuming the nyx ratter has an IQ above water temperature.
---
Love it, almost like a haiku.
---
How many cynos?
---
How do I break away from highsec?
---
Unless CCP decides to kill your gameplay because they have to sell plex more than have players online...
---
So will WH space actually be made more dangerous too? Will HS be reduced in value or is it totally fine to bot away into the trillions with market alts? Will LS have its value reduced or also be included in the destabilization? This seems way more like Hilmar knee-jerking to the realization he did literally nothing for 10 years than it does a company actually making a good game.
---
Me too, but the best thing would have been to sell then and buy injectors or whatever  next week after a drop
---
friend of mine got banned 3 years ago for using a ratting bot on his Nyx while he was not actively playing. 
---
he also used it to hotdrop renters together with Marshy in the dronelands while he was actily playing ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Thanks so much for the info! I'm gonna start dipping my toes in this activity. I always considered isk making through PVP very inconsistent, yet potentially very profitable. I'll go and try my luck on some derelict citadels. Maybe it'll become worthwhile enough to be a gateway to delving deeper into wormholes!
---
A tengu then.
---
All of Darkness?
---
Game play -&gt; game play -&gt; general questions.
---
CCP just use a LOKTA VOLTERA curve (google it if you don't know what it is)  to optimise for some weeks the amount of cash flow and palyer who paid. 
---
So with blackout CCP just release the movement of decrease of the 'target' curve, and make massive increase of predator curve. 
---
Soon predator curve will be at a maximum and start to shut down drastically. 
---
But during a few time they will have more people, so enought to try to make PA happy.
---
Thank you :). I was considering SP Farms but I read you need -a lot- of accounts to make it worthwhile.
---
And aye I have neuts and a cyno now, won't be dying anytime soon (I hope).. Training for T2 heavies as we speak.
---
"I said solo, I never said I couldn't use an alt"
---
IF you happen to find yourself in a rookie-ship or don't want to warp to a sig/anom/belt/whatever  just activate or re-activate the tutorial to get some easy to kill npcs in your current system. The location often makes a good save spot too. 
---
And I am quite sure the chance for higher sp rewards in the daily event scales with your last login. Because all the pilots I logged in the day before got 10k (20 logins so far without more sp) but my old pilots I haven't logged in for weeks got 25k or 50k more often than not.
---
I never have anything to complain about, its just more fun if I do:)
---
dude i'm literally arguing against the people here that think their playstyle is the only true endgame and tell them theres more views of the game than just theirs. thats the exact opposite of what you say i'm doing.  
---
and about posting quantity: maybe *you* should at least use a few braincells before hitting that Save-button or go back to posting as much as you did yesterday.
---
Relevant because?
---
This, as long as you're a paying sub -- your opinion matters.
---
this ^ 100%. When undocking, the thought process should be "what is the value, what are contingency plans, what can I engage, what should I look for."
---
&gt;fuck OP because i suck dick at this game
---
999 kill marks though
---
He even doomsdayed somebody
---
People call things glitches because they can't understand the root cause of the bug
---
&gt; Also it's a Titan char, not a throwaway VNI bot . . .
---
about as relevant as this then
---
A kill is a kill, imo.
---
At least you’re making your own content.
---
All the people nitpicking you about the type of kills are probably F1 monkeys that can only pvp with an anchor or can’t even multi task hitting F1 plus a scram lol.
---
Of course its a video game and its not a perfect market, but its really more real market than the usual theoretical examples from classes. 
---
I just said its quite easy to explain the market rules with examples of the game and watch how the rules of the market works. 
---
Don't get it so literally.
---
???
---
No, I pissed in my coffee this morning.
---
It's sterile and I like the taste.
---
That Hel looks like a cannon on that girls shoulder
---
You forgot that 10% of the PvPers were not able to kill this ship before 999 killmarks. I am pretty sure that not many people in this game can handle this.
---
*buzzer sounds*
---
I'm sorry, u/xxmeatloverxx, but that is **incorrect**.
---
Skill injectors
---
buy plex now and resell when sale is over
---
Lowsec could be great the day CCP decide to change it. Actually in Ls you take more risk than 0.0/WH and HS for ... less money (in pve/mining).
---
If you 're group is enought powerfull he just go to 0.0 to make more money. If you 're group is little he goes to WH and cry after bad boys in 0.0 for pve/ mining (i don't speack pvp alliance/corp, just pve/mining).  LS have no interest with this configuration so ...
---
Hey mate, there are a lot of people shitting on you for gaming newbro kills, but you made a goal and achieved it, and I think regardless of how it was done the fact you accomplished it is commendable.
---
So big props to ya.
---
5 Lions is the true Voltron, the rest is bullshit.
---
must be a weird bug
---
Gotta take what you can get
---
Or alts in rookie ships.
---
Downvoted because its Bryg.
---
Well you know dropping dreads on battleships isn't exactly high risk.
---
Yep, the best thing to do is to get a fast shippy, and steal loot / salvage. Find a battle ship or someone tanking the damage, and salvage their kills. If the Triglavian Target you just warp right off.
---
Pls keep killing caps
---
You can do whatever you can. Be careful not to get blown up.
---
That's a legit great idea. Create a specialty kill mark skin, single use, that gets created and applied to any ship that breaks 999.
---
I first noticed it without a booster. Just happened to take the screenshot when the booster was active.
---
Surprised pikachu
---
Yeah, for me that show that the true problem is the rorqual itself, way too easy to multibox to make isk even with t2drone, you can use shitfit an with insurance you can mine even longer. That just take your more time
---
This guy salts
---
You can use local and zkillboard to see who the real asshats are, utilize the resources. Two to avoid are Casper24 in the south, and Destropia in the north. Don't bother fighting them, they run around with several billion worth of shit
---
Don't go to Tama
---
I prefer mining to PVP any day. He is 100% correct and some people feel this way.
---
you have 999 problems, but the lack of bloodshed aint one
---
It would be more badass and intimidating if we could display our collection of corpses all over our ships..it would be fun as hell chasing after someone with all these popsicles chained and impaled to your ship haha..come on ccp. :D
---
When I was waiting for the game to come out, I imagined that pro mechanic abilities would allow a player to make improvements to other people's ships that they could then use without needing to specialize in that themselves.  
---
I was very naive.
---
All the global skills are just CCP shooting themselves in the foot over player retention.  They comprise a cynical gamble on sunk cost addiction for the tiny percent that take the bait.
---
I mean, how much sense could it possibly make to require players to have drones at V before using a logistics drone?
---
skill farming... no... if it's profitable on 1 account, it's profitable on 100. all the accounts are doing the same thing, if it works on 100, it works on 1 and vice versa.
---
looking at jita prices from goonometrics in a spreadsheet i knocked up at last week you're looking at -26m per month for a character that requires 500 plex per month to subscribe, then you earn 217m per month for each character you have training with MCTs (MCTs are cheaper than the 485 plex for multiple char training). that means an account is worth ~400m per month per account. that's using jita prices, with no trade skills, and no standings.
---
if you plug 1dq1 prices, and good trade skills in, and the profit is kinda hilarious.
---
Look who you reply to.
---
"highest pilot activity in months"
---
well nice way to fake stats, the same time you announced blackout you announced a free skill point week. if you want to analyze the impact of the blackout, don't do anything to try to bring those who cancelled their subs back.
---
Are you retarded?
---
Free mct? Does that still exist? I just resubbed 2 accs and would've loved to have that...
---
Updoot for dodgeball ref.
---
I read this title and thought you meant mining drones. Like miner IIs.
---
:|
---
I'm retarded.
---
absolutely, i dont see a reason why you shouldnt be able to. of the T1 ships every battlecruiser or battleship can easily survive even the harder sites. cruisers might be a bit dangerous with the skill limitations though tankwise.
---
You’ll still get kicked pretty quickly. Even if you avoid getting killed, which wouldn’t be easy (a bomber could warp to you at 0, decloak, and kill you pretty easily. And if you’re awake enough to be dodging that, then you could probably be making better isk doing something else), you’d have a hard time making a decent amount of isk. And of course, if you ever want to join that alliance or one of its allies in the future, you’re probably not going to be allowed to.
---
Dude as long as we can use them to punch other pilots I am up for it, can you imagine getting a wrecking shot on a bomber it should spin uncontrollably into all the other bombers and then explode taking all the others with it.
---
Buy 3 months omega and you can get a mct for one dollar. But it’s not a tradeable mct, it just activates on your account immediately after you purchase it
---
when r u getting a new fiend
---
Dude, he’s using that ship to kill new players that wander into that system due to a low level mission. Any moron that has played Eve for a month could get those kills, probably in a noob ship to boot.
---
For a few yes... 
---
And others the vision of forming a new alliance and striking out into sov.. is dead.
---
17.6% more.
---
Link fit
---
What's the purpose to your comment, other then to be a dick? Are about to tell me the root cause of the bug?
---
You can always mine in hi sec or wormhole, seems it s where you belong.
---
Hello, _SeventyNine
---
I'm sorry I don't don't anything about missions, but like the other guy said you should be in Incursions probably. 
---
As far as ratting goes, the Vexor Navy Issue cruiser was just nerfed, and most people are moving to the Myrmidon and Dominix. Drones semi-AFK is the current meta, at least in nullsec. I was getting about 20M/hr with my bad drone skills. YMMV of course. 
---
I haven't seen anyone in a Drake, but maybe they still have a place in highsec. 
---
I agree totally with the other people: extracting and then injecting between two of your characters is a waste of SP and money/PLEX unless there's more we don't know. 
---
Are you looking to join a corp or alliance? I'm in Dreddit [B0rt] which is the big Reddit corp. With our alliance TEST Alliance, we run the bottom right corner of the map. 
---
We've got safe space in which to make money, and groups (with comms and Discord) around different activities. You could find your place and make some friends! 
---
Dreddit and TEST are PVP organisations, currently in a war on enemy turf. There are lots of fleets every day to join, all different kinds. The Dreddit ones, especially, are often fun. Drunk fleets and fleets where you can bring whatever you want. If you want to FC your own fleet, we'll help you get people to join, and give out SRP for most fleets. (Ship Replacement Program, we pay for any ships that get lost on fleets)
---
We're a fun bunch if you want to hang out, make money, and go on fleets to kill bad guys. 
---
Check www.DredditIsRecruiting.com for the application process and public HR Discord link. (Yes, there's HR in space)
---
I read comment somewhere saying that its all fun and games till someone lit the cyno... But personally I would agree with different opinion, that its fun and games when someone lit the cyno.
---
Realistically, players might as well be allowed to go a little beyond fitting caps, but with penalties.  ~10% might be reasonable, or 2% per mechanic level.  lol
---
Overfit your PG and then you have reduced capacitor storage, reduced shield hp, slower speed and active modules use more capacitor.
---
Overfit your CPU and then you have a sig penalty, capacitor and shield regen penalty, agility reduction, resistance reductions and eh.. longer warp time.
---
Conversely, underfitting a ship could come with bonuses to shield and cap regen or other benefits.
---
Perhaps if CCP could implement the ability to use a wii more or some other motion tracking controller it could work. We could also use them to bridge ships without a cyno, but you have to aim it well or you're gonna wind up wildly off course.
---
He got a 1000 kills with that ship, without losing it. He did that by killing noobs that wandered into a low sec system for a low level mission so the only aspect that is a feat, is his perseverance.
---
mostly a question of organization and effort. You can't control everything, but if you're organized in a big group people like CODE or the most wardecking pirate corps had way less chance to gank miners in your area.
---
A well organized group can make hisec much safer than it is by nature.
---
I do know that - since we *mostly* drop on supers or other caps. Simply because non-HAW dreads are not that great against battleships.
---
Well, then Goons do everything right to protect their territory. They worked hard for this, as well as other organized big groups - why should some small gang pvp-nerds be able to disrupt it?
---
Thanks.
---
i mean... it's still better than the last rorqual theorycraft
---
Yep. It'll take some one else with guys and innovation to do it.
---
You think complaining is fun? You must be fun at parties
---
Oh ok I didn’t notice that
---
lmao this guy
---
Suicide ganking - tank your ship and avoid Burn Jita once a year, it's so close to PVP-less as to be near indistinguishable.
---
Wardecs - join an NPC corp if you're that desperate to avoid risk.
---
This could be the VR minigame breakthrough ccp has been chasing for years
---
It’s all good. Just letting you know.
---
I am asking for your opinion, I stated mine as I am in a small alliance myself.
---
I was headed to amamake. I probably shouldnt always use the suggested route from "set destination" but i learned my lesson.
---
Faction warfare is a good start cheap frig pvp and gets you into using d-scan and you get the feel for what kills what
---
Probably had more to do with politics of Init and goons being on opposite sides than anything else. No idea why that would stop the whole fight but it’s the only explanation I can think of
---
Best solution is to stop participating in r/eve
---
This sub is only run by the worst of players.
---
And why tf would anyone do that? The argument isn't that highsec isn't safe enough.
---
It's that null is too safe.
---
Come back, thanks to blackout bombing runs are actually great again
---
It's not about finding content but more about surviving as it's harder to rat and protect our few sovs.
---
I fully understand! You are lazy and want it all on one link. I'm telling you that having it on one link is not needed if you knew what you were doing. Which obviously you don't.
---
Downvoted by the fat no friends stuck in a room lonely trolls.  Hilarious.
---
Coy? You haven't asked. I'm in GSF.
---
holy shit, dude! i just finished the 27 jump route there and its so much more than i expected! THANK YOU SOOOO MUCH! :D
---
Here's my 2 euros. Pretty self explanatory I think.  
---
https://imgur.com/EYsNnqw
---
I dont think that's still available? Think it was just for 2 days
---
So lasers are instant and have perfect mining. Excavs have travel time, a easy point of weakness to be bombed and a high cost. You have removed almost 3 bill from the cost of a fitted rorq, made them safer and removed travel time from changing rocks. 
---
So they will earn a lot more and are safer doing it. With the only loss being having one tube of fighter vs many flights of drones.
---
Rule number 1 in eve: never take a fair fight, if everyone has the same amount of resources most luckily no need to fight a war
---
I love this.
---
Not hard to do if you're sitting on a hi-sec gate in low-sec with eyes on the other side. I doubt this guy would risk losing his ship to a real pvper after about 100-200 killmarks.
---
Yeah, I used to fight him all the time. We had a battle of whose alt could pin whose alt down first most days. Dude was exceptionally good I learned a lot from him.
---
It’s been almost a decade since I ran missions so I don’t remember the specifics but each race of NPC deals a certain type of damage (this is what you tank against) and are weak against a certain type of damage (this is what ammo you use).
---
Plenty of guides a quick google away to tell you what rat does what. You can refit before each mission to ensure you are going in with the right hardeners and ammo.
---
I'm ok with Capitol mining lazors, as using excas in blackout is no bueno uwu
---
I am new, give me a break.

Whomar?

Where?
---
After so heavily monetizing the skill training system? They'd be lynched.
---
&gt; Buy 3 months omega and you can get a mct for one dollar.
---
As someone who buys annually, I feel like I'm getting fucked in the wrong way here.
---
Pirates don't care brotha
---
So I got an automatic 3 month resub going... where's my MCT?
---
Normies... didnt suspect you of being an emo hi school child.
---
I'm starting a new FW Corp if you want in p.m. me
---
One more, if you have a annual sub to Eve, you get all non-discount based promos that occur during your sub.
---
So if a "Buy game time and get free/discounted MCT" happens again, the annual sub gets the discounted MCT offer without having to buy more game time.
---
Oh for sure I get it just got to keep those memes up
---
then here's some advice for ever new thing you encounter.
---
stop, and observe. or in internet slang 'lurk more'.
---
it's generally a good idea try and get a feel of the situation before you jump in with 2 feet and a blindfold.
---
Venal is pretty active. Chinese GOTG are there as are OOS (russians). Can get a decent fight probably.
---
Destroyers aren't immune to bubbles, but there are ways to see them coming. Dotlan can help you see how the pipe looks, and when you're in a system don't warp directly to the gate. Find something like a planet or a moon that's within DScan range of your gate and dscan it from there to see if it's clear. No way to know if it's bubbled on the other side, but at least you can check your out gate.
---
That said, don't take a destroyer to null to rat. You won't be able to, the rats will kill you.
---
&gt; The nature of the hard core L33t players
---
* The nature of people with valid credit cards
---
Fixed because it seemed like you didn't understand anyone who has a credit card does the least pve possible
---
How is entrenching those who did it a problem?I did not and will not, and I don't see how that's an issue at all.
---
Problem is not pve players in themselves but those who advocate for changes that makes the game easier or less risky for them. It's what led to the name carebears I guess.
---
You may be a truer eve player if you are a pve player accepting the risks to lose your ship than some "pvp" players that do not tolerate it in their "pvp" activities.
---
that's a lot of kill marks for such a terrible, terrible, terrible ship
---
FHC EVE subforum has been 90% dead for a while now. General discussion is where it is at
---
Lol I'm being sarcastic.
---
I most of the time use gecko, but they are kinda expensive... sentrys also not bad for when something spawns too far
---
shout out to all my bros still winning this game and so done with this bs
---
but you don't have zero intel... Utilize your alliance mates or park one of your alts on a gate and use DSCAN
---
Yea i've multiboxed a few games I wasn't supposed to with them.
---
Am I the only one too stupid to run here?
---
Wow thanks for my first Reddit silver!
---
Just launch probes and relog. Probes out dont return to your ship
---
Who hates pve players? Just because people blow them up? By that logic PvP players loathe themselves haha.
---
People Do hate botters, and strongly dislike afkers though.
---
Just use faction they are better anyway
---
At least use navy drones
---
Agree we should have got the option
---
Oh, so the ADM's, people in space, number of jumps, rets killed, ships killed etc will dissapear from Dotlan and the ingame map too?
---
About 15% more
---
Good, you wanna buyback 200 excavators from me?
---
I'll give you 98% discount
---
People don't automate character creation on accounts that don't frequently get banned. Safe to say a titan char isn't banned monthly.
---
It's arguable that null is the richest area of the game, WH are much more rich... BTW, let's assume this is true and it's the safest area of the game.
---
Why? Or better how it became this supposed safest area of the game?
---
Because of supercap umbrella?
---
Ok, so what's the relation between supercap umbrella and local blackout?
---
What's the meaning of this move?
---
As many have noticed this literally erased small null groups and pushed null people to concentrate into the biggest alliances, isn't that the exact opposite of the so called CCP objective?
---
And let's think about how it was possible to create such an invincible supercap umbrella, why we didn't have this problem in past?
---
Supers and titans were available since ages, why nobody in past think to use them as defensive asset?
---
The answer is simple and anyone of us know it: injectors.
---
In past it was almost impossible to train such a huge amount of titan and super pilots, the limit were not the resources needed to build then, but the limited number of pilots available.
---
Also Keepstars are a factor in this catastrophic equation, you can quickly and easily train your titan and super toon, and you're not stuck in the ship like in past, the circle is complete and it's insane...
---
Who created injectors and Keepstars? Who is responsible for this disaster?
---
Simple, CCP.
---
Now CCP is trying to move the hide this disaster
---
* huge sp offer to limit the dramatic statistics on player losses
---
* pushing the "risk adverse players base" narrative
---
And now plex discount, what a coincidence uh?
---
Greatly reduce the opportunity for players (mainly small groups, newbies and pve subcaps) to get isks form the game to push them to buy plex.
---
Honestly I'm disgusted from this...
---
Thanks that is what I was wondering and I acually want to be able to get state lp so that is good news
---
Good advice!  Thanks!  What should I take to null to Rat?  Could I do it in a cruiser?  (I don't really like to fly anything bigger than a cruiser, but I do have BC skill).
---
This literally has nothing do this with this change
---
Man I did buy a 3month sub and didn't see any of that. Could I trouble you for a link?
---
There is skill based intel right now!???!
---
Fully agreed
---
Myrmidons are probably the smallest thing you can rat in these days. There might be some sites in some corners of space you can partially clear with a very blingy cruiser, but at that point you'd be better off bringing a 100m ISK Myrmidon down there with you. But those are very squishy, and honestly ratting in nullsec without being part of a corp that lives there might prove kind of challenging and not worth the effort.
---
Have you considered skilling into an Astero? They can be multipurposed for both PvP and exploration. Explo can be good money, and you can bully the people trying to do it in Buzzards and Herons and the like.
---
“The Blackout” didn’t do shit.  But good to see pvpers deciding to take risks to kill titans instead of crying on the forums for nerfs to supers
---
Heh, seen this coming a mile away. I had already worked my way up to 10 recruits via RAF'ing my own alts and paying the $15 DLC. This gave 460 plex, 2 accelerators and an extractor - essentially covering the cost of that alt. It's always been better value to do this (especially with the $50 packs on sale) then to buy straight PLEX. 
---
When this news hit I RAF'd 10 accounts for $165 and got over 30 billion (20 recruits gets you 2000 plex) - you can't buy that much  PLEX for $165. 
---
This seems like a change purely intended to make them more money, and diminishes the value of the RAF rewards. That being said - it doesn't seem unfair :p
---
No based on the fact that you say dumb shit, thats not a opinion thats a fact,   
---
Making a ad hominem attack where you shoot compleatly in the dark just helped  solidifying my statement.  
---
oh and FYI. Multiple alliances and coalitions use Shared space already and it works wonders and thus compleatly killed your entire concept, it's all a question of coordinating.
---
If you can sell the stuff
---
Dont laugh of the guy, it's almost sad that he so easily can make a fool of himself and not even want to realise it.
---
To be fair even if 90% are shit fit noobs it’s still a great tally as long as he hasn’t padded his kill board with alts.
---
noone is banned monthly. look, there have been made some very valid points, and i never claimed these are bots, just that the names sound like out of a generator.  
---
theres no point in throwing arguments at me now that have much less substance than the ones that were already made
---
Like what?
---
The T1 ?
---
How to get started at EVE online? I find the 'player is a ship' kinda wierd at first but the economy driven by players, the giant sandbox and the battles seems all pretty interesting to get into.
---
If they are T1 its ok
---
Faction the ones with names like caldari or navy etc
---
The faction drones, green.

---
Use T2 drones. Yes, that requires omega. That is the point.
---
Yes, as a wreck on the overview...
---
Yeah, even if we got completely dunked on, its not like we lose much iskwise.
---
I've popped in the last few days and can't help but notice the accuracy of what you're saying.
---
Hope you're doing well though bud.
---
If they are T1 they are shit, which is as designed.
---
Source on that?
---
To complicate matters slightly, I sometimes fly brawlers and sometimes fly kiters. There are fights that I simply won't take with a brawler because the threat of escalation makes it not worth it. I will take those fights with a kiter because I might be able to evade the escalation if and when it happens. I'm still learning. Last time I did this I got a titan and 3 supercaps dropped on me and I died. To sum up, I'm not sure I buy that flying kiting or nano ships is the definition of risk averse. It's a counter to cyno escalations that allows a solo or small gang player to engage without straight feeding.
---
rage harder spodbrain
---
If people didn't have that attitude why did we see record number of excavator kills once the blackout hit? Those are clearly things that don't fight back at all.
---
oh man, i got no clue what data they collect, and I'm pretty confident that neither does CCP
---
Always upvote people actively hunting and killing botters - GJ!

No, they’re pussies. Kill the tackle and leave if backup shows up on dscan
---
tank may be sterile but the pipes sure aint.
---
don't worry the big surprise is coming soon^TM
---
I think the main reason is that PVE players have been, historically, very loud whiners and done the most large scale actions to hurt the game. All the safety, all the lobbying ccp for more safety, the blues, the botting, all of that is the work of people who want to make isk without actually interacting with players or participating in the game.
---
Hisec? I got nothin against hisec tbh. Praise James for keeping the miners lives interesting, but if you wanna live in hisec that's your thing. A healthy hisec funds a healthy game.

what option do they have? they either:

2. Get dunked in a titan and posted all over r/Eve as "lol noob cant fly a titan" or "idiot loses titan in X"

The argument is that the information is already readily available to anyone who wants it. You are either too lazy or too stupid to understand that. CCP provides this information, not because they are obligated to, but because they know folks are interested in it. To sit there and cry because you can't figure out how to manipulate data sets or import from a website just sounds like you are stomping your feet just for the attention. 
---
I have not backed down from that position from the start. You are seriously misunderstanding me if you believe that, in which case I would direct you to a better translator than the one you are using now.

Send ccp a message. If you bought them a couple days before they might be able to do something.

We have kept alphas alive in well fit T1 cruisers, BCs and BSs. Our fleet also has a Praxis fit designed for day one alphas that fill a key role in our fleets (hitting targets over 70km). We also had an alpha who ran a myrmidon and was the drone controller for the fleet. Lots of options to help. 
---
In addition to this you can still strap salvager I's on a destroyer and run salvage. 
---
Contact me in game if you need more information, or are interested in checking out our public fleets.

---
sounds like a fleet to warp smart bombers into.....
---
I think there's already been discussion about the amount of intel that is available and whether or not it is good for the game. 
---
One thing I would like to address is the parallel you're trying to draw between a tool like the in game map and a tool like Near2 for example. 
---
One is an in game tool that a person has to actually open and individually view data for the areas to get the information. The 3rd party tool automatically parses the information and feeds the information to a player without them having to do anything. So they can receive intel updates based on the system they're in without actually having to do anything other than run a program in the background. I honestly don't see why that hasn't been marked as automating.
---
Spending time with marketing and customer engagement is such a disaster I know.
---
&gt;impenetrable fortress
---
So, where's yours? If it's impenetrable, you should have no problem disclosing its location. You DO have one, right? Being so impenetrable, there's really no excuse for not having one.
---
If the Nyx ratter in this situation had an IQ above water temperature they would not have tackled it. Check mate.
---
The reason is obviously because there are a lot of people that are using the blackout as an opportunity to finally try and do some small amount of meaningful damage to large null empires after all this time.
---
But besides that, there are the obvious facts that a) Rorquals very much do fight back (they're still one of the best combat ships in the game), and b) killing excavators and harassing miners often provokes the locals into actually bringing combat ships to fight you ([this one](https://zkillboard.com/related/30002616/201907170100/) for example was started by killing an excavator).
---

OMG you have spent 5 years clubbing babies in Kubinen. I mean we've all engaged in this style of gameplay to some extent, but 5 freaking YEARS!

You can use an ESI endpoint to get the full list. I'm sure others have done this too. I would check to see if Fuzzworks has a list handy--I think he might.

Ok, thanks

Im omega but still have some days to skill them
---
Oh God why would you do that?!?!

At LEAST do combat sigs.
---
But in my case it's missions.

Funny because, plenty of people are still using them. Compare to previously, everyone took the "risk" because it was not actually risky. That is not balanced.

If we claim there is an issue with injected capitals at all, how can you not see a problem with the idea that people could not ever catch up to those that were able to inject capitals?
---
A large part of being successful in eve pvp is learning to pick your engagements. FW is one of the best places to do this. Forget about your killboard. Find 3 frigates/destroyers you like and buy many of them-go loose them and learn.
---
This is a copy / pasted message, but fell free to answer it if you have any questions.
---
First of all, take the time to do the career agent missions. It will show you many things in the game (exploration, mining, industry, hauling, etc).
---
Then, well Eve is a sandbox, so you will need to figure out what you want to do. As a new player, you are not strictly limited, but what ever you do, Eve can be dull and boring, mechanics are complex at first because of the amount of informations you need to learn but once you understand them it's generally a lot easier. What ever you want to do, try to have fun or enjoy the complex interactions mechanics are creating, so basically don't grind isk for the sake of grinding isk.
---
- Want to explore the stars alone ? Buy an exploration frigate, a cloaking device and go around the stars looking for data and relic sties. Maybe join a wormhole corp and enjoy space where frontiers change everyday, and need scanning on a daily basis. There are some newbie friendly wormhole corps that can teach you the way of Bob.
---
- Want to join one of the large nullsec empire ? Join TEST, Pandemic Horde, Karmafleet or Brave. They are all well known newbie friendly corporation/alliance and they will give you free ships, a place in fleet, and people are generally willing to teach you. They also offer good opportunities for new players to make isk (exploration and salvaging mainly).
---
- Overwhelmed by large organizations but still want to join an active PvP corp ? Try and look for a small faction warfare corp or alliance, there are plenty of them and they will also guide you, get you a place in fleet and you will enjoy endless content.
---
- Want to settle in a bit more in "security" ? Run some combat mission in HS. But try not to do that, really.
---
- Want to become the space Rockefeller ? Look into market, region trading, and all the shit. You won't blow space ships but if you enjoy raw data, data analysis (like, real data analysis) this is your thing. Isk revenue is potentially infinite.
---
- Want to mine rocks and turn them into modules, ships, ammunition ? Start mining and industry. Pro tip, don't do it alone in HS you don't have a single chance, join Goons (= Karmafleet), nullsec have way more valuable ore and Goons are basically the safest most organized industry in the game. You can also join some renter corp but that's up to you.
---
- Want to build your own corp ? Build it with some friends, maybe to do industry, or PvE, or PvP. My 5 isk : FW is a really good way to make isk and have some fight for new players. Low class WH can also be interesting.
---
A short list of advice :
---
- [This is your bible](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main_Page)
---
- Right clic EVERYTHING.
---
- Eve is a sand box, figure out what you want to have fun doing and don't bother what other thinks. There is no right way to play Eve.
---
- Faction do not matter. Pick one you feels seems cool and then ignore it for ever since you can fly any ship of any faction without any difference.
---
- Eve is also a dangerous game. Don't use ships you can't afford to loose. Both players and NPCs can wreck you quite fast, even later in the game when you will fly big expensive ships.
---
- People will kill you. No matter where you are, people can and will kill you, even in high security space. HS is actually the worst place to be, because you think everyone is friendly when it's really not the case. Outside, it's a lot more easier, everyone is your enemy.
---
- The very same people that will kill you can also be the same people that will explain to you why you died if you ask them. People in the game are generally friendly and don't mind teaching new players.
---
- Don't get attached to your ships.
---
- Eve shine when played with other people. Don't be afraid of recruitment policies, knock at the door, join a corp, have fun with others.
---
- Learn of your mistakes, don't get angry. If you died, it's your fault.
---
- r/evenewbies it's a good place to ask stupid question. r/evejobs it's a good place to look for a corp.
---

To start with it ***not*** free as you already stated  " You pay 15% of the value if it's automagic to a new safer system. If you pick another upwell in the same system the price is *0.5%*" This might need an adjustment but I wouldn't know how much that would be.
---
Keepstars are not impenetrable [https://zkillboard.com/ship/35834/losses/](https://zkillboard.com/ship/35834/losses/) as you can see here many have died since they been added to the game.
---
"Never understood free unlimited insurance coverage with upwell structures." This was brought over from npc stations. Also insurance on Supers at best is 3bil while other capitals are down to 850mil ish.
---
smash that pay to win button and crash gate \^_^
---

---
Try running a locator agent on yourself.
---
Join a faction warfare corp! They'll teach you!
---
The issue has been that basically none of those really will outdo the defenders inherent advantages.
---
The blackout haa helped make it possible for the skilled to catch the unprepared, at least closing the gap a bit.
---
But defender Intel networks and defensive asset availability will always surpass the attackers.
---
Plenty do, leave an MTU, come back in a salvage ship later
---
Thank you for taking risk aversion to the next level. Well done.
---
I don't believe you can't use Mining Barges on an Alpha account
---
I'm sure this will receive a hate boner but here a thought to this.
---
Capital mining lasers that give the equivalent to current excavators and cost about the same as said excavators. This would use 5 of the highslots on the rorqual.
---
Querns_GSF if I kill YOUR keepstar, it gets moved to that other keepstar in 1DQ1. If its not supers there are another 40 faction forts or whatever it can move through, am I supposed to bubble fuck 40 faction forts?
---
Funny.
---
Much of eve doesn't have 2 keepstars in one system.
---
But THICCer than I'd think but still nice painting
---
Awox me once shame on you
---
Awox me twice shame on me
---
Awox me thrice and you're probably in snuff
---

---
It's not shameful though, he's literally playing the game as it was supposed to be played 
---
No different from killing afk ratters in null
---
Any post killing bots is a good post to me. Good job, RiotRick.
---
&lt;3 I hope you get some of it out.
---
Because they're insecure shitlords with fragile egos.
---
&gt; Also insurance on Supers at best is 3bil
---
It's actually 100 million in 1dQ where you asset safety to another keepstar. 100m for your 20b fit  super back in pristine condition. That's dumb as hell if true right?
---
I have done this and never find much spend most of your time scanning down gas sites
---
 Sure if you’re hunting ratters.
---
Perhaps your targets need to change
---
&gt; not free 
---
The insurance is free. The coverage. You pay after the accident, not before. Free unlimited coverage and your rates are 15% if you don't have another structure, 0.5% if you do.
---
So far for me, mission running is okay because I haven't seen all the scenarios yet. But I probably wouldn't be doing it if not for the LP stuff I have my eye on. Highsec mining ... meh. I enjoy it when I just got finished with some excitement and have something I want to manufacture, but I doubt I'd want to do it all the time. The most fun I had mining was the first time I decided to build a cruiser without any help. Diving into Lowsec and Nullsec solo in a Venture and making it back out alive is a thrilling experience ... Doing it twenty times to bring back enough ore for the ship because my reprocessing skill was shit, not so much.
---
That's it's role though? It's a tackling frigate, that's how it was designed.
---
So you want to big blocks to steam roll all groups in nullsec, lowsec and higsec so they can get **all your stuff** ?            
---
Dumb, stupid or newbie without slightest idea how the game works?
---
Fucking awesome. Congratulations. You set a goal and made it happen by any means you saw fit, and you didn't let anyone else's standards get in the way. This is what EVE is often about. Besides, \[rationalizing\] CCP found years ago that newbies who get exploded are more likely to stay. And this fits EVE lore depicting Capsuleers as [uncaring gods beyond ethics and morality](https://community.eveonline.com/backstory/chronicles/xenocracy/).
---
This is also a whole new level in badass villainy. You baptized this sword in the blood of 999 innocent lives just because you could.

Be *proud* that you've caused some to go full salt. When making any claim to anything, there will always be the ... gatekeepers -- the ones who say that something isn't "real" or you "don't deserve something" unless X, Y, Z goal posts have been met. For instance, people accusing others of faking an illness because it doesn't match their personal experience with it. These goalposts are always a moving target -- there are always going to be other people who believe differently. 
---
Fuck 'em. It was *your* goal all along, not theirs. Enjoy your Phantasm.

? Stainguy? I asked that an isk-sink be added like insurance has in game where you pay for coverage. I also noted 0.5% is dumb because upwell structure proliferation.

Where did you get this make all of eve wormhole space bullshit from? It's like querns coming out of his industry/mining stuff out the gate with guns blazing.

Why not all 3? Don't limit yourself fam 😎
---
100% win idea.
---
True, it's very RNG. I've had several sites in a row give me over 100m each. And I've also had several duds in a row barely breaking 10m.
---
Then kill all 3 Keepstars and quit whining.
---
Or better yet, kill even 1. I dare ya.

Yes. Please never post or comment here again.

#THE BLACKOUT IS A MASSIVE SUCCESS
---
Welcome to Eve. Jumping straight in instead of waiting will honestly prove to be very costly.
---
I'm not the one with a problem here.
---
Risk averse kiting?
---
I don't want asset safety removed - there are good reasons for it. I want iteration upon the concept because you don't pay 15%, but instead 0.5%, because you have another structure in the same system. Unlimited coverage for 0.5% when previously titans couldn't dock. It seems like a great opportunity for iteration considering there is too much ISK in our economy by Hilmar and CCPs accounting. (hence why they target anomalies, make zero sum events and have abyss (no bounties, many ships lost)
---
Wow yeah, that Helios is sure going to hold me down long enough for his buddies to arrive, assuming they are arriving in the next ten milliseconds.
---
You couldn't kill them before either if they stayed in NPC corps
---
Now try the same thing in Black Rise...
---
Tip 1: Big ships aren't fun to fly. The main source of enjoyment from something big comes from flying it with your friends. They're just too slow.
---
Tip 2: Exploration is a great source of income. Go with support skills relevant to the Sisters of EVE ship line. Capacitor is the least important of the Magic 14 for this line until you're flying a Stratios (since those have energy turrets). The armor, navigation, and engineering (especially CPU for Sisters) should be the top priorities. Mix that in with scanning and drone skills (getting Drones V is of utmost important for using an exploration ship in combat).  [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/The\_Magic\_14](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/The_Magic_14)
---
Tip 3: Train into expedition frigates. You know the cheap mining frigate, the Venture that you get in the tutorial missions? There's only one way to make enough ISK for it to be worth your time using outside of shared can operations where you get an equal share to everyone else based on time spent mining. That way is a great fit for alongside exploration. Stick a probe scanner and two gas harvesters onto it (an expensive skillbook but worthwhile). You can use it for wormhole exploration now. You're not going to be able to scan stuff as easily, but you're going for gas sites and gas sites aren't hard to scan. Wormhole gas is really good money. Expedition frigates are like the Venture but better. In this case, you'd want the Prospect, which is basically twice as good at mining as the Venture, while being a lot harder to kill and able to fit a cloak.
---
Tip 4: Join a good corp. Signal Cartel is excellent and has an extremely good reputation for exploration. I quite like them. However, if you're interested in PVP, you'd need to do that on a different character since they have a standing rule that nobody is allowed to shoot unless shot at first. I recommend E-Uni for any new player, not just because I am a member (which is usually the reason why people recommend KarmaFleet or Dreddit for new players, it's not unusual to move on from E-Uni to those, but E-Uni is neutral to in-game politics so you don't have to commit to something without learning more about it and while a bit underwhelming on the PVP side of things, gives you exposure to pretty much everything, we're the corp which runs the wiki that I linked to and we specialize in helping new people).
---
Tip 5: Don't get too attached to your ships. The wormhole that you will be tanking exploration ships into have unfriendly locals. Some of the sites will destroy your ship if you fail the minigame. You'll be able to bring in enough revenue from what you bring home that it will bee worth it. The most important ship, the only one that you should absolutely never lose, is friendship.

mjd-sniper-raven only works if you are omega, since alphas are not being able to use MJD alphas will have a hard time to keep distance to sleepers due cap management. The issue with the rattle mentioned below is the distance to warpins, unless you pre-bookmark your warpins you are a sitting duck ready for pvp. If you can't figure out how to utilize this fit and equipment or you don't have skills to run any of those modules without downgrading stay out of a C3 you're simply not ready. Preferably Omega, with 2 acc or chars(Rattle pilot and scanner/salvager pilot), but you could work with only 1 out if daytripping from k-space staging(if switching ships...means less income) or alpha being member of a wh corp. Salvager instead of Drone Link Augmentor is a risky move...if someone sneaks up, while you being on grid salvaging, well I hope he is a solo pvp noob or you'll die. So most of the time just not worth trouble salvaging with your main ISK printing machine. A dedicated salvaging-pilot is a whole new story. Gecko is optional, faction T1 drones aren't.

---
Aww too bad. How long ago was it?
---
Have you ever perma tanked by a dual prop dramiel in a larger ship?
---
Mm, I see.  So ratting is probably out for me then as an isk source.  Good to know nonetheless!
---
I have considered moving to the Astero, and while I am skilled to fly it, I have 0 drone skills, because I really hate them.  I dislike that one skill covers electronic warfare, combat, mining, remote repairs, etc.  A very poor development decision imo, so I take a strong stance against them.  If I *must* do it in to be successful, then I will, but are there any other options?
---
1. Omeca gold would start frothing at the mouth over this.
---
2. Not a bad idea from a large alliance perspective. The lasers would need to cost the same as excavators or more. Limit to 5 per rorqual.
---
3. Drone should stay but reduction of the bays.
---
4. Not a fighter fan to begin with but that me. Also as a non mining platform I think someone could abuse the mechanic on this. example Heavy tackle rorqual with a group of SS fighters could put a Super in a very bad spot quickly.
---
With recent black out there has been a massive increase to excavator killmails but I don't think this will be sustainable as people will switch to t2 mining drones instead meaning the over all price of rorquals km will drop.
---
Hmm... Would need indy core + boost to get the maximum return out of them. This could limit them to using 4 mining lasers or less... or there not sitting in a standing fleet.
---
If your putting 50 in a belt then the people attacking need to pony up an equal amount of assets to take those out.
---
People will bitch about no plex sales for months then when ccp does a plex sale they will begin to bitch that it's just for the metrics. Fucking wild.
---
No is arguing it's dps and autos in general are trash. But that's an issue with the weapon system not the frigate. It's role and ship bonuses very clearly emulate tackling frigates, not brawlers.
---
NaCl
---
Elite pvp
---
Stratios really.
---
It's within the sandbox
---
Catalyst could yield highest income in invasion area
---
Maybe so, but worth showboating on reddit?
---
I’m doing alright dude. Hope everything is good with you, too.
---
Entosis warfare is a huge bore, for new and old players, many people avoid entosis interactions due to the nature of the mechanic itself, but at the same time it is a baseline system for capture that could be fallen back on. Maybe rather then screaming nerf we look into things that could use a buff. The bastion and siege modules could use a buff.
---
We could make it so that if you are willing to risk a bit more then t1 frigates, you could get more rewards! Allow the bastion and siege modules to allow weapons to penetrate ihub and tcu hardening. While a bastion or siege module is active, you can directly damage them and bypass entosis entirely, for both timers. Also allow these modules to allow for exceeding the damage cap on citadels without removing it entirely. Allow super sluggish movement, and even super slow align/warp while disabling activation of prop mod, im talking super slow like a 90 second warp while module is active. With the siege module the trade off could be that capacitor regans slow enough so that it would be very difficult to jump out immediately after exiting siege, and the ability to self rep is lost entirely. Bastion module gets a bigger damage buff, and would still allow cap recharge and self reps. You would see more escalations as people try to bypass entosis, bigger, more expensive things would be risked. But if you don’t want to risk then you can always fall back to the baseline. People will risk more, people will lose more, supers will die to elaborate setups thanks to blackout and subpar intel, things will burn, and there could be a lot more fun involved!
---
Disallow doomsdays and heavy fighter torpedo abilities in lowsec, and remove HAWS and long range fighters from the game entirely, or gut their tracking against subcaps. This wouldn’t be too drastic but still be an effective nerf. But in the end I think buffing less used stuff rather then nerfing things into irrelevance is the more correct move.
---
Kill asset safety because it keeps memorable moments from occurring in this game. It is too easy to cop out, but find a way to make it so that there is a way to keep these items from being destroyed entirely, allow them to be recovered like back in the day when they were only locked in a station but not destroyed, but for the love of eve stop them from teleporting everything to the nearest safe space. I don’t know the answer here. Maybe jettison everything down to a planet in system if a structure is lost, allowing for recovery from a Poco should your force hold the system’s ihub/poco again in the future, or you join their group down the road with a spy or otherwise. 📷
---
Resource depletion is an excellent idea, also it would be great to add unique value to certain areas besides faction battleship blueprints, some regions should hold more value to counteract places with high value in regional layout alone. Make geopolitics rise once again!
---
i am sure you are a nice guy with a lot of strengths. reading comprehension however is not one of them.
---
&gt; Keep in mind that all type of additional or extra insurance and costs will be in most of the cases applied to people that are unable to login
---
No, people who don't log in pay 15% right, its auto teleport ed in 20 days. In 5 days if you're active player you have it teleported for 0.5% to another structure of your choice in the same system. AFK already get the 15% penalty.
---
I want that 0.5% to be changed or have payment for the coverage. If you don't pay you get the 15% rate standard, not an option to transfer your super for 0.5% to the next keepstar over.
---
he is happy that he met a personal goal in a sandbox. 
---
you could be happy for him as well, that he accomplished a personal goal that is objectively difficult, or you could be like many others in the thread shitting on him for how he did it. 
---
in my mind, as long as he didnt just eject a shit ton of frigates and pop them all to farm killmarks it's worth a reddit post
---
there are certainly far worse posts out there
---
Yeah you are right
---
The reason PvE players are called carebears and often hated are because some of them continuously ask for changes to the game that would make them safer and isolate them from the rest of the sandbox.
---
He came in on a ping after the tide had turned
---
as Bob intended
---
Looked into the 'issue'. Don't know how you got the link but the fitting is not published publicly. So if you ware not the user who created it you won't be able to view the fitting.
---
When the user who added the fitting wil make it publicly you will be able to view it.
---
&gt;Iron Crown
---
  lol
---
Why make a new character? Just use the same ones.
---
Get the fuck to the top
---
Reddit automatically removes quickmeme.com. This is good because your post is terrible.
---
&gt; oh man, i got no clue 
---
Yeah, pretty much
---
What do you mean by one skill covering all that? There are separate skills for repair and a few different kinds of harvesting drones, as well as fighters and subsets thereof. Also sentry drones are separate. Do you mean you're upset that it requires so many skillpoints to use drones effectively?
---
I hate to break it to you, but drones are a huge part of this game and you'll need them to be successful. Not every ship uses them, but oftentimes the best course of action for a given task is to fly something that uses drones. Even if they're not the focus of the build like they are for an Astero or ratting Myrmidon, they can be very useful.
---
Another thing you can consider is fitting a fancy Tengu or Loki and hitting wormhole combat sites. There are pros and cons to this. The main downside is that the income is not bounty-based like it is for nullsec ratting. This means you have to get out with your loot alive to make anything. The main upside, however, is that the loot takes up very little volume so you won't need to bring something to haul for you if you don't want. Check out [Rykki's Guide](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17cNu8hxqJKqkkPnhDlIuJY-IT6ps7kTNCd3BEz0Bvqs/edit#gid=0) to get an idea of how much you'd need to be able to tank and how much loot you'll get out of each kind of site in each class of wormhole.
---
this is not something that only the dramiel can do though. plenty of other ships can sig tank a larger ship while still bringing more dps.
---
Any post relating to MuH EmPiRe BuIlDiNg never disappoints in bringing querns posting
---
This is no longer a thing, that offer ended a week ago man
---
Always disliked its design, but never tried it as a result. Mind sending me your fit? I love the cursor. This might be just as fun
---
If there was a paired reduction in income, perhaps. All missions, exploration, Incursions, etc would all need maybe a 35% nerf.
---
Or better yet, we could just leave it as is.
---
I feel like you've never been in a coalition.
---
Because it's not fair that a super is better than my cloaky Loki! I want the best ship. 
---
I gank noobs in ventures in a squad no smaller than 12. That's fine.
---
But if someone drops a cap or two and kills us, that's wrong and the game is broken and CCP need to nerf everything that isn't my favourite ship to the ground, so everything, even caps, are defenceless against my favourite ship.
---
Except when there is still more than enough for everybody.
---
The curse of black rise: i get 30 kmks... I’m 100% gonna die in next 30 mins. Lol
---
999 noobs on the wall
---
Looks amazing, great job.
---
Stratios :D
---
Anyone with a brain would know an alt seeing SNUFF spiking in a local chat, in a system in range of a ratting Nyx would result in shit not undocking.
---
I pay the .5% to move items from one structure to another so I don't have to freight it myself.
---
its speed doesn't really do it much good though, once tackled.
---
No wonder why Goons were able to rise to fame so quickly- They started out in rifters
---
Right, it still doesn't warp fast enough.
---
Base line insurance is free. This applies to all ships as done by ccp. A titan base line return is about a bil.
---
Current cost and pay out on a Titan [https://i.imgur.com/WvHIywO.png](https://i.imgur.com/WvHIywO.png).
---
And I can whole hearty say you get jack shit on return investment.
---
Accurate. This guy is the epitome of the passive, risk-averse, deck stacking "PvPer".
---
lmao thats great
---
$20 this guy doesn’t play eve.
---
&gt; that is objectively difficult
---
  The only difficult thing here is not to die of boredom doing it for 3 years. Most of those hulls and fits *I* could kill solo- And I fucking suck at solo PvP. Really speaks for itself.
---
A single keepstar constitutes empire building? What sort of trash standards do you subhumans have?
---
Dramiel is overpowered in the right hands and a top tier decloker. Love that ship
---
your missing the point
---
its original role and what it is now are two different things, it was a very popular monster that has been nerfed.
---
True. It just allows them to avoid taxes now.
---
Math way off. At 20bil even going to another citadel in system that going to be 1bil isk on return cost.
---
Next time use a calculator. Also eviction generally going to cost more as most of the time once someone is going through the eviction everything going to lowsec or it been moved before hand.
---
Dog, in the same system? Word? With a 5 day delay?
---
How hell camped is your home system? Poster refers to the option to activate asset safety whenever, but 0.5% rate is to the same system. So although you can have asset safety without a building blowing up, it seemed pretty situational.
---
People who try to diminished your effort obviously have no idea what belt hunting in lowsec is about. I would have made it to my tenth kill before springing a trap 👍😂
---
nothing gets reported to anyone unless an active player posts in the proper chat. the log file is then read.
---
You might want to know what you are talking about, before you actually speak. There is nothing automatic about the way these tools work. It requires player input every time.
---
Then we can call the tour "Warped Tour" I'll see if The Aquabats! will be willing to tag along
---
Afk salvaging an algos with salvage drones and mtu does well. More active Noctis.
---
Ratting try a myrm best isk for the risk.
---
honestly i dont think any of them should, in reality i would rather see other pirate faction ships nerfed down to the dramiels level but i dont see that happening. CCP loves introducing new overpowered ships that basically make everything else useless
---
Why are you so mad that `chinaman = bot` isn't a valid argument?
---
What matters most is tank, if you are able to tank enough dps for the site, then no matter how low your DPS is, You will finish the site(Unless it's like 150 dps). More DPS=Faster site clear time=More isk/h. For C3 Ratting, Rattlesnake is the best because it can talk every site and no matter your skills you can still get ok dps
---
What will this change you think? If someone starts loosing strucures they are already om backfoot, the game is healthier if someone can quickly recover from their loss and have at it again.
---
0.5% of 20 billion is 100 million. I'm not sure how the 'borrowing' math or whatever they teach today handles this - but 100 million isk is 0.5% of 20 billion. 
---
&gt; Next time use a calculator
---
For math that simple?
---
it can easily be killed as is by navy faction frigs. would you like it to be on tier with t1s?
---
It got parsed out here a few days ago, but it's always been that way.
---
Could go to a nullsec corp also. GSF, Test, pH are the more known ones. Less so is Provi block or Gotg. I'm sure there more but that most of the major and minor powers that I find attractive for newer people.
---
I got things wrong because of how long it's been since i used them, that's different from lying, you can note the other comment corrected me already.
---
The taranis is a got and cheap option
---
&gt;*" If you know they have a titan and super umbrella and hunt their anyway,  it is the epitome of ignorance to assume they won’t be used to hand you a  participation trophy win because you 1) refuse to match what they have  and 2) want to fight them anyways "*
---
Thr funny part, is that they complain about how easy it is to acquire supercaps and 'proliferation', yet can't be bothered to acquire supercaps themselves....
---
The truth is, EVE is about getting out there and doing stuff.  The only cancer comes from apathy and grenade throwers who belittle those who 'do'.
---
HINT: It's you, you are the cancer.  You.  Yourself.  Not him.  (happy to draw a diagram)
---
I was recently in a corp who had a bot in Discord that would comment into a specific channel when ice belts depleted and respawned. I've been searching for a bot that performs this function, to no avail. Any assistance in my endeavor would be greatly appreciated
---
Making blood cloaks fits the line of ships, like covert ops frigates and recons.
---
Buffing cyno inhibits isnt about buffing hanking, it's a side effect of nerfing things with a jump drive.
---
Has anybody ever told you that you have a victim complex?
---
Cause they'd be trash-tier headshot fodder most likely.
---
They've spent years training up T3C's to drop on ventures and get guaranteed kills, so why would they do anything that evens the playing field?
---
are you dumb or just completely consumed by the flairbait?
---
Probably the most expensive skin that isn't limited edition. One billion in t1 frigates plus hours of grinding...
---
nope, winning eve is not playing eve. its ok, a lot of people get confused about that, happens all the time.
---
I feel like the only one who got pissy was you, getting called a risk averse bully seems to have struck a nerve.
---
small and medium autos do suck
---
Wow SA goons are dead, it's an inclusive environment now, please check your tox
---
Sorry he didn't play Eve the way you wanted him to.  Guess we're all in your sandbox?
---
One thing not yet mentioned by others here: Different C3 sites are very different. Check the name before you warp to it. If you're having trouble with one site, you may not be having trouble with all of the sites.
---
... someone is so super salty, they have apparently gone through and systematically downvoted every single positive post in the thread
---
hey i didnt say it was skill-intensive. tedium is still difficult, just a different kind of it.
---
Daaamn dude! looks dope! 
---
Suppose someone wanted to commission something, would you be up for it?
---
The market thanks you for your service.
---
Wtf can i do against mines?
---
There aren't any, so... nothing?
---
Compared to a dread, that would be squishier, less mobile, more expensive, less insurance, and a higher skill requirement.
---
Theyd almost never be used.
---
No, you must click jump on your selected target or hold D and click. 
---
You can obviously auto pilot which will land you 10k or so off the gate and generally take a bit longer and/ or get you killed depending on where you are or what you are flying.
---
Nah, I think I'll stay.
---
Nice try though. Sorry that you're one of them.
---
Miss read the point though it was 5% I need to get glasses.
---
The advantage of the dramiel isn't supposed to be its dps. The dramiel is the fastest ship in the game. It can literally run down anything else on grid. If you use it to pick off interceptors and provide warpins for fleet members onto enemy ships and fleets it's absolutely in its element. Not every single ship is really a solo hunter, even if you can get kills with any ship.
---
&gt; What will this change you think?
---
It will remove ISK from the system, which has too much isk. 
---
&gt; he game is healthier if someone can quickly recover from their loss and have at it again.
---
Not trying to take this feature away, you can recover pretty quickly at 1% cost to do this as well. There is room for tweaking this or developing the feature.
---
when spouting buzzwords you should generally be able to spell them and know what they mean
---
This, pretty much. It's a sandbox. Anything is valid. That he set and met a personal goal is *admirable* regardless of the content of it or how easy it was to do. We define for ourselves what is satisfactory. I sometimes can get satisfaction in EVE just from jumping and scanning wormholes.
---
It depends on what's keeping you in highsec. If it's fear of losing your ship, then a "suicide" roam where you intentionally go and get blown up could be the key. When I was learning how to manage local reps, I suicided battleships into Provi (insured!) until I felt good about how I was handling myself.
---
I think you have a misconception about wh live. Our only cloaky ships are normally scouts and sabres.
---
Cause #ccp #gamemechanics #corecode
---
I got killed by some kind of bomb/mine at a gate in nullsec, if i member right.
---
The dramiel still excels at it's role. In it's niche, it is strong.
---
so its time for the hourly "hey guys my idea is really good, check it out!"
---
Not gonna lie you kinda get boring after awhile when will you switch it up to saying current iteration of empire building is lame (would make your posting more interesting since you're in the biggest empire)
---
You can scrape every log file of every chat room, including local
---
Well, *someone's* gotta teach them that EVE is dangerous, I suppose...
---
Yep, sitting cloaked on a wh listening for the sound of someone coming through so that you can safely disengage from your PvE activities.
---
It probably was either a smartbomb, which are usually fitted to large ships, or a guided bomb, launched by a stealth bomber. The former you just have to be careful when jumping gates, and not get too close to the smartbomber. The guided bombs, you have a couple seconds while the bomb coasts about 30km, where you can either shoot it (it won’t blow up that way) or warp off.
---
I guess we can't really complain as it's still free sp, but yeah that's definitely frustrating
---
its not obsolete
---
&gt; Base line insurance is free.
---
nono, the discussion is asset safety, what it does in effect is act as insurance.
---
You pay 0.5% to have your fully fit shit handed back to you, not to be confused with your ship blew up and you get a fraction of it's value and need to go buy/make it again. These are 2 different things. Perhaps insurance wasn't the best terminology.
---
&gt;&gt;Curse has lots of Fraternity mission runners, but nobody really lives there as their main home
---
Correction: plenty of smaller (many Russian) groups based in there. Also, many Chinese actually live there and consider OSY as their home, not O3-
---
Lol, another one of these "you'll do what i say or you're a liar" guys. 
---
The world doesn't really work the way you want it to
---
Yeah nothing to loss worst they say is no
---
Calling the heathens that deny gods will 'innocent' is a really odd way to look at it. Learn your place.
---
(also please bring out more cheap punishers to fight our cheap punishers; those fights are really fun)
---
i do 2x50 2x 25k
---
Hey man, a kill is a kill. This is eve!
---
I don't do pve. Most of us don't do pve tbh. We normally scout for targets
---
I don't mind have your daily if you think they are crap
---
why do you hate chinese so much?
---
I don't do pve and most of my corp isn't interested either. We scout for targets and content. 
---
On another note, please link the km doing pve and unfair people came along to kill you.
---
&gt; Not gonna lie you kinda get boring after awhile
---
then don't read my posts
---
problem solved
---
Dunno Man in Delve you have shittons of guys ratting (in full pvp tank fit) so backout didnt change much.
---
You need to get as much ehp so you can survive the minute a cyno inhib needs to anchor. Usually you have Theta respond before that (and afterwards you're dead anyways) so everyone should fit accordingly to tank a bunch of Dreads for a Minute at least... 40mil ehp+, also Burst Projector etc.
---
I guess Delve is no space you want to drop hostile Supers and Titans in and the blackout definitly does not change that.
---
no ppl will just set a macro to hit D every 30s insted of autopilot
---
I was just referring to the randomizer. I like the free SP, but not all that fair if some people are getting 3x to 5x as much as me.
---
Why are you so fucking retarded?
---
Not every ship is a 1 vs 1 solo boat dude - the Dram is used in fleet ops as the fastest ship in the game
---
Reminder that a CSM member kicked human players corps to make space for botting renters.
---
&gt; This will definitely make space more dangerous
---
Probably not as dangerous as blops existing. See you want danger for the evil boogeyman who's cloaked looking for intel, specifically for kills. That seems disingenuous. 
---
How about spending your time thinking of changes that is dangerous for everyone and doesn't have a scenario where it's no longer scary for you personally to undock.
---
Have you reported this guy to Sort Dragon? Ex CSM member
---
my changes
---
1 - new extractors small (100k) and med (225k)
---
2 - new injector Med 
---
3 - lock the injector to the imput type I.E extract caldari frigate you get a caldari frigate injector in the size that you extracted
---
underrated comment of the year.
---
2x 25k and 2x10k :/
---
It's a little ridiculous, should be escalating based on the last day's performance. If you only kill a few asteroid belt rats when you mine in HS, and only get 10k, that should continue. However, if you're someone that rats or runs missions and are killing hundreds of rats, you should get 10k day 1, 25k day 2, and 50k day 3 and onward as long as you upkeep that killing rate.
---
It makes no sense to request someone who only does PvE is forced to go and get tons of kills to meet those requirements while simultaneously telling people who primarily PvE that they'll only be rewarded for a single kill.
---
*looks at virtue clone*
---
How is there not a problem then with not being able to catch up with people who started in 2003 instead of 2010?
---
yeah it is pretty shit we dont get more free handouts, cccp sux
---
I don't do PvE at all.  But nice deflection.  "Scout for targets and content"...lol, too funny, you don't need to be cloaked for that if you were any good at it.
---
The issue with injected capitals vs traditonially trained is that to train caps normally takes several years - which means that they have to keep the account plexed, skill queue maintained etc for several years, without deviating from that plan.
---
With injectors, they can just throw money at the problem meaning that everyone with a whim can have a cap alt.
---
Who didn't buy a plex and spend your 300-500m on faction fit hurricanes only to lose it at the first high to low-sec gate. That's how you learn p2w mechanics of eve. You pay, they win.
---
I don't say that this is wrong ... but we need isk sinks that players want to use every day - because they will remove much more isk without penalizing player actions or stuff that is happening ingame.       
---
Look, you can use T1 ammo or pay more for Faction (you buy them from LP store using isk and LP).          
---
Players are **happy** because they can use better ammo.              
---
Player 'home' was burned down when he was away, for example in hospital or on deployment (**lets be honest if you are online you will move your stuff before structure dies**) now when he is back to game **first thing he need to do is pay ISK in order to be able to recover assets**.
---
Do corvettes count for killmarks? Otherwise you could get 1000 frigates for less than 500m easily.
---
There's gonna be an "edit flair" option in the sidebar. If you're on mobile, I have no idea if you can do it there.
---
Wow, you took this waaay to personally..
---
They have cents in Europe too you know
---
If there's a prerequisite you have to do, it isn't free. Even if it's as mundane as warping to 2-3 asteroid belts and killing 5 frigates, some people aren't willing to do that. And while that's on them for being lazy fucks, I still think having these prereqs being a bit more suitable for people with different playstyles makes more sense than it being random.
---
I think someone is tired of having their excavators booshed off while the afk netflix
---
Didnt knew killmarks stop at 999.
---
This is why noobs play for a week and leave.
---
No matter what quality the kills, is a rare achievement.  Congrats!
---
Yes, depending on stuff
---
Smartbomb Phantasm vs. a blob of skinny t1 explo frigs
---
Ok, so how about cloaks make ships like the combat recon class. Cannot be seen on d-scan when active. Combat recons get the module baked in. No more 2k cloak deactivation. No more warping your fleet away and back because a bug decloaked everyone putting your fleet on dscan. Your BS would not be flapping in the breeze as much. You give up being invisible on grid. Sure your warp in would effect reaction time but it does already.
---
How much did you invest when it cost over 4 mln?
---
Flair checks out
---
you are not paying money, it is free
---
Lets say you were only mostly afk, you didn't get the 15% rate, showed up within a week and choose the 0.5%, you're telling me if that was 1% it would break the bank? How about if the rate was 0.5% but you paid for the privilege via a small monthly fee if your assets were over 40B in that single structure for instance?
---
0.5% is token at best. Why not 0.25%? Why not 1%? Why not a negligible isk sink for this service, which adds up when 10,000 people pay it.
---
How exactly you want to get your isk sink is on you, I'm just noting a reasonable spot to place one so long as we're overly concerned with the isk delta.
---
It isn't insurance it is a courier service, sure it is a magical service but hell eve has a ton of these, let me put this 3000 m3 countainer here and get 3900 m3. 
---
is the cost to low yes IMO 
---
local move 15% nearest low sec 25%-45% choice of drop off (I would like to add, low sec only again) 75-150%
---
&gt; Perhaps if CCP could implement the ability to use a wii mote or some other motion tracking controller it could work. 
---

I see where you get confused. That’s entirely the wrong kind of more dangerous. Unlimited cloaks are fair and balanced because everyone can use them while creating great content.
---
Are we still in the bargaining stage? I thought people had moved on to the depression stage at this point. At this rate it's still going to be a while before we have acceptance of the fact that local is not coming back. 
---
The false dichotomy at the end is pretty transparent. 
---
Get gud Scrub.
---
That’s a shame because I want it removed.  Bring loot piñatas to nullsec,maybe then People would fight for their structures.
---
Nobody is saying it's a bad thing, just that it doesn't make sense to have it randomly giving away things. Anything that is given freely and randomly is always going to have people feeling cheated, regardless of whether or not they are actually losing anything.
---
This is only going to make the Rorqual even more stupidly overpowered. One of the main counters to Rorquals is destroying or stealing the excavators, allowing you to defang its mining capabilities. By building its mining capability into the ship itself you eliminate the possibility for solo or small-group hunters to interdict a Rorqual's mining capability without blowing it up, a time-consuming process that almost always gets interrupted by significant reinforcements.
---
Cloak is dumb, don't get me wrong. I think most players have an issue with cloaking in it's current iteration. People come up with structures that decloak when they reach max energy then recharge or cloak requiring more energy to keep active to limit it to specific cloak-oriented ships.
---
I was merely pointing out the 'gut reaction' the the OPs thread is going to be -&gt; but you really just want eve safer for you - not more dangerous for you and you're shoehorning this with the guise of "lets make eve dangerous" 
---
I doubt the place to discuss specifics is this thread, that started; "everyone screeching unless they agree with me." OP probably just gets made fun of because of how he presented the issue.
---
Next you’ll ask to remove i-stabs and nanofiber because they let things warp too fast.
---
id love to see a module thats like a reverse nos, sending some of your heat to a targeted ship, not heat-damage mind you, just the heat level
---
glitch isn't the proper word.  that is all

But that's the problem, it's not a fact.

OP gets made fun of because he is an entitled little cunt.

It’s in the sidebar. Select your alliance (or someone else’s alliance) and post to your heart’s content.

fuck the wii mote, i forgot about the power glove. CCP use that
---
give it 2 bomb launchers aswell, Bombathon
---
&gt;YOU on the other hand, are nothing more than an honorless mercenary that would sell his grandmothers soul to the devil if the LP to ISK conversion is high enough.
---
i wanna say that this is true but im stuck with amarr since sev years no matter the tier or LP gain so i guess  i have alot more integrity than i thought i have
---
They just need to HTFU!  /s
---
It's a very obtuse game.  Even if they don't get ganked in their first week, there's still the massive market, confusing UI, and realization that they'll never be able to "catch up" to the "higher level" players.  And it's not an instant gratification type game, which is what most "play for a week and quit" players are looking for in any game.
---
You must have missed the TIS interview. It doesn't sound like they're keen on bringing it back. It sounds like they're pleased with the results.
---
my 600mil value is after conversion into shit to sell at current /isk/lp values
---
tier 5 LP multiplier + Level 4 FW missions = more LP than i know what to do with 
---
its a extreemly retarded system and should be straight up deleted (the FW missions)

Yeah... There's a farmer that lives by my grandparents that has planted his field with soy for five years now and never changed what's there. And honestly I don't think he even cares about his yield, it floods over every year and I don't think he's even successfully harvested it
---
Wrong sub. Industry is uncool and only pussies should do it in highest.
---
well ramming damage would not apply inside a citadel/station grid (tether range/ 10km from one) or to fleet members, problem solved
---
Only krabs? You mean the people who create content, and pay for the game. You realize how much of a contradiction that is.
---
Lol he doesn’t care..... he replies to us with “there are no bots in my alliance”.... he won’t acknowledge another group in the coalition that’s botting it seems....
---
Weird way to cope with being a badposter
---
"initially" - I see what you did there!
---
not gonna lie but im pretty sure that would make it less dangerous....
---
make the NPC station have a cynojammer effect (on 24/7 and indestructible)
---
T3 BS that can fit a single XL gun (like the old abbadon)
---
I want timers removed, the ultimate in safety, but than people can't wake their 40 year old asses up to fight for it because they have work and lives right. It's unfair for afk (read sleeping or working) people so we have timers.
---
Some such logic is also used for being told its safe and afking for a year only to lose all your stuff and quit the game. It's hard to walk that stuff back. Asset safety is a thing, as long as this is a thing - lets consider balancing it.
---
It's not that I don't agree, it's that the playerbase won't go for that. But they might be open to further development or balancing of asset safety.
---
Please show us on your rorqual where the bombers touched you
---
Shhh - let these idiots keep thinking we cant tell
---
Laser Legion. You need 600-650 ehp/s omni tank and around +20GJ capacitor with a battery to safely rat all C3 sites(except some relics).
---
Its pretty slow still and wont give amazing results. But you can still do it. 
---
Refitting will be tight but doable. You have to really min max the storage you have avaible.
---
But you get a cool Netflix documentary out of it...  If you don't, Netflix won't have content.

You can still buy it, it will add 3 months of omega on top of your yearly sub

Why don’t you just start a free account and try out the tutorials?
---
There is almost this same exact thread every other day, why don’t you look through the last month of top posts.
---
show me where on the doll the mean man touched you.
---
&gt; If you see Avatars dying and still jump in yours you are a true hero
---
I think you're not spelling idiot correctly :P
---
I was obviously very wrong. Pleasantly wrong =D 
---
I also love CCPs reaction to all of this.
---
Cloaks aren't dumb. With the exception of T3Cs, covops cloaking ships have glaring weaknesses that balance them out. Bombers are glass cannons, blops are extremely expensive glass cannons, recons have niche roles but get pwned in any other situation, and SOE ships generally have to choose between dealing damage or having tank. And most of them are expensive (sometimes absurdly so).
---
Blops, as a playstyle, requires much more effort and prep than anything else I've seen. One thing goes wrong and you wipe out the whole fleet. Threads like this are just a result of the butthurt we generate when we do it right. Suck it up, buttercup. Or gtfo.
---
https://lmgtfy.com/?q=starting+eve+in+2019
---
Or it could be different people bitching :P
---
Bots getting less use would drop plex price. That is generally considered a success :P
---
No brainer. Nullsec was safer than any 1.0 system, it was a bit of a joke really. "Eve, the hardcore space game where losses are meaningful and space is dangerous.... But isk is everywhere and you get free instant intel in the most dangerous space!"
---
This show's how little you know about the rorq. A bomber will only uncloak once it launches it's bombs. Even on a small rock it takes about 15 secs to retrieve your drones. Bombs detonate at 12. Even a vigilant pilot as nearly no chance of saving them. Much rather launch t2's and go watch Netflix.
---
No-one does this.
---
Everyone rolls the holes and doesn't pop the new ones, then uses the sig window to see new connections.
---
Cloaks are used on scouts and that's it.
---
Or just launch T2's?
---
I’d like to wholeheartedly approve this message. Well summarized.
---
Literally unplayable
---
Do some FW, it's decent money and you can learn to pvp.
---
But before that I would recommend doing starter missions
---
Great argument! I'm glad we had this intelligent discussion. 👍
---
Spoken like someone has never spent any time in wormhole space at all.
---
First of all, good wormholers dont PVE with active wormholes in their system. They roll every hole (including the static) and then PVE.
---
Secondly, removing cloaks would only hurt scouts in your situation. Whats the difference between parking a cloaked ship 50km off a hole and parking an inty 500km off a hole? Either way, you can just 'look at' the hole and dock when you hear an activation.
---
Interesting
---
YOU are uncool!
---
Make sure to get referred. You wouldn't wanna miss the free 750k sp. Also Quill18 started doing tutorials for beginners. Just search in YouTube for him and the videos will pop right up. The referral link is in his bio below the video.
---
Oh!  A friend said that the "drones" skill covers all of that, so I thought it was ridiculous that you could just train drones and have access to all the different types of drones for many purposes.  Guess I should have investigated further.
---
Thank you so much for the advice!  I think I will work towards the Astero and do exploration/PvP since they are the things I enjoy the most.
---
Good content - 10/10 recommend.
---
I want to come back to EVE, it's a beautiful game, full of wonders and frightening moments.
---
"combat clones"     
---
--Removed Skill Training     
---
--Added Combat bonuses (similar to implants)
---
But the old Bois are logging back in (concurrent players down)
---
Everyone will be undocking for dank PvP (PvP is starting to dry up as evidenced by the multiple posts this week, since the "hunters" want easy kills not fights)
---
Bots are all gone! (Bots are still working, that's how people are killing them. It's likely a matter of time before they're updated)
---
Whatever you personally consider a success, CCP are going out of their way to get people to log in and play with these Plex offers, 3 season of skills events, MCT for $1 etc. If the blackout was as successful as Reddit want it to be, they wouldn't need to do any of that.
---
Wear that name with HONOR Bro! Or his Ghost will come back and get ya!
---
thats not how that works but okay
---
Well done.
---
Most underrated comment, new title “Escalation gone wrong but I want free blackout karma so I put it in the title.”  FTFY
---
Water temp in celcius for us yanks.
---
&gt; Cloaks aren't dumb
---
They're pretty dumb dude. They need to be balanced.
---
&gt; lists hips balanced around cloaking
---
But those aren't the only ships that can cloak and why should cloak last 23 hours with no opportunity to interact with the cloaked pilot? 
---
You think T1 cloak is balanced at the pricepoint of 1 million isk for unlimited uptime with no way to stop it without manually piloting into where a cloaker might be? Give your best excuse as to why we shouldn't change cloak mechanics.
---
&gt; Suck it up, buttercup. Or gtfo.
---
goons beat you again or CCP or whoever's victim you are. Nobody cares. But learn to take your advice lol. I can't be the one crying when the thinktank also wants cloaking changed, it's your ass getting left by the curbside lol.
---
Meh. I love the dram, it's one of my favorite ships. A tiny dps boost wouldn't break it but I don't think it's 100% necessary either. Its strength is its speed. It would have trouble with other pirate frigs without really clever flying, but it can dunk on "meta" shit like Retris.
---
Awesome work as per usual Geo!
---
I hate that excuse so much... When I say we need EVE 2, I basically want the exact game we have except coded in modern standards so this legacy shit is gone
---
Wow how dare you applying your unrealistic beauty standards to this beautiful ship. That's male fantasy right there.
---
While a valid point in general, we only started moving out of low-sec once INIT secured the titans. Hence them waiting for 7 minutes to let us mid our dreads.
---
old clip i have of me and Syn messing around he was a pretty entertaining streamer from some clips i have seen.  
---
this video is prob from around beginning of the year.
---
There’s gratification in this game? I thought only masochists played Eve.
---
No, you being retarded is entirely unrelated to where you're from, what color your skin is or whatever. It's related to the dumb shit you say.
---
&gt; Old Sebiestor character creator had something like that.
---
I miss all the options we had back then. The crazy headgear, the masks, and the wide range of facial expression.
---
Pleasure! Check out the drone skill tree, there’s lots of different skills in there... There is one master skill called “Drones” that you’ll need to 5 but there’s a couple dozen others that are necessary.
---
Seconded. Way to many people here and in game just want to shit all over everything. Or 1up the achievement. 
---
Recently in game a new bro mentioned they finally broke 50million isk. A milestone they were proud of. The next comment was "lol, I just hot 3 billion". I do say gents, I was taken aback. So I sent the new bro a little welcoming gift.
---
Anyway, good on you, i think it is neat.
---
Bruh momento, Thanks Rick for giving me the opportunity to FC this
---
Someone asking for dram buffs... What a time to be alive
---
There's a huge mounting of information you'll have to figure out, but the best part of the game comes when you find a corp and members you can play with. I think if you get a referral you start out with more skill points, and there may be a starter pack you can buy as well that will lump you some more skillpoints. That's a good start to get you up and running. I'd run the career agents and do some missions before looking for a corp.
---
I'd just give cloaks fuel or have them run like the command bursts. They definitely shouldn't be an infinite mod.
---
Yes it's still a good day to start! You can definitely play it as casual and have fun, even/especially as an alpha (=free account). 
---
The game isn't hard, it's *deep* : there are a lot of different mechanis for a lot of different gameplay and possibilities. 
---
You don't need to learn everything day 1, the more you will be familiar with basics, the more you will want/need to learn new stuffs. 
---
Don't hesitate to ask ingame (there is a new player channel), or here in the no stupid question post or in the sub r/evenewbies. Google a lot, youtube and [Eve University](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main_Page) will be your friends. 
---
There are also a lot of noob friendly corporation to join, they will help you to find what you like and how to do it.
---
Get in a Corp as soon as possible, since there is the blackout i would actually suggest some highsec corp with at least occasional pvp in the beginning. If you don't like it there, just move forward to the next corp. Eve gets far easier if you learn it with/from other people. PVP can also be done outside the corp with public fleets like Spectre, Bombersbar and several more.
---
There is some Learning Corps outside like EVE University, but its a pain in the ass to wait as a newbie for their application process. Also several Null corps will accept you basically instant, and provide the same service more or less if you want directly to see the big fleet battles.
---
/r/evejobs , official forum recruitment or ig channel recruitment can be helpful to get some overview.
---
I think it should be removed and replaced by something entirely different. If you lose a citadel, your stuff gets emergency jettisoned to the nearest planet. In order to recover it, you need to be apart of the group that owns the Ihub and a poco on the planet. This way stuff isn't lost forever, and can be recovered by taking the space back, joining a spy, or joining them outright. There would be no cost involved and it would be similar to how it used to be when stations would flip. People would fight hard to defend their stuff instead of pressing a button and moonwalking out before any kind of memorable event or battle could occur. This would also encourage guerilla warfare after the war and actually trying to retake space lost.
---
If you enlist in faction warfare you see the "enemy of" message. There are also standings that you may have towards a race that can be good or bad that are affected by running missions and such, if you have standings lower than a certain level you'll see the "known criminal" message.
---
Dude read all my conversation ith falcon i have 2: One i explain to him he doesn't know super capital (and he said himself YES he doesn't know). 
---
Second about data share by CCP , and he said if one day you have improvement to propose, post they. 
---
So i just post my idea. If falcon see it nice, other case not a big deal.  
---
You just proof (again) you have no valid argument and you don't know about what you are speacking CONGRATS.
---
Faction warfare? What is that?
---
Bring it to Delve my old friend!  Congrats too BTW
---
I’m really excited for the future of EvE.  Obviously, it might go to complete s***, but at least trying to shake things up is literally the only smart option they have right now - if nothing changed, the stagnation of the game and the declining player base would otherwise just endure a slow, painful death.
---
The comments about not making an EVE classic really struck a chord.  That really would be a cop out - make it BETTER!
---
Side note: I read that (really) long article by a guy from Goons about why the Blackout was appeasing solo and small gang PVP’ers and how people just didn’t understand nullsec, on the basis that large corps are motivated by the goal of owning their bits of space.  I mean, crikey, maybe that’s true of the leadership groups in these nullblocks who are playing war games. And probably true of their line-members at a conceptual level.  But surely the current meta of alliance pvp is not going to keep people interested long-term? It’s dull as dishwater!
---
Anyhoo - was exciting to hear about potential changes to resources and sov that might make things spicy!
---
in character/lore, the factions are opposed to one another, but in game, unless you participate in faction warfare or shoot NPCs that belong to the major empire factions, your standings with them will not fall low enough for them to shoot you. 
---
race/faction means nothing otherwise, since anyone can fly anything given enough time. 
---
the messages you are seeing are a result of someone having -5 or lower standing with the faction, which causes the police to shoot them
---
D:
---
Big true
---
While I recommend fw for newbros, I think exploration for isk, and fw for frigate explosions is the way to go.
---
Imho while fw makes money, newbros should separate pve/pvp
---
Thsi subredit have a majority of player who want to hunt safely and you want remove a magic button who make they can't die and have perfect intel ?
---
You can enlist with the militia of the races and do faction warfare missions or other fw activities. Amarr and Caldari are allies and Minmatar and Gallente are allies. Most of the fw stuff happens in low security space, but even in high sec, you can shoot players who are members of an enemy faction and Concord won't shoot you (I think). Someone else who knows more about fw can probably give you more details.
---
Okay so there is a lot of lore that shouldn't be ignored, so here's some info on my view of this topic.
---
Each faction has an ally. Gallente allied with Minmatar and Caldari allied with Amarr.
---
Each faction has an enemy. Gallente fight Caldari and Minmatar fights Amarr (and vice versa). Their allies of enemies are considered enemies as well.
---
That message with the "enemy of the state" or whatever means, they either are criminals or are involved in the opposing factions's war.
---
Ships of many manufacturers exist. Check the ship tree for full info ingame.
---
Why would one refuse service to someone in a "vehicle make" or "brand" you don't like?
---
What would you call people who go after defenseless ships?  Why do you think they're doing it?  Why do you think it's so common?  The vast majority of engagements in Eve Online are one-sided stomps where someone or a small group of people get caught out and overwhelmed.  I tried FW solo pvp and all I got from it were a bunch of baits where someone would have a buddy or 10+ in the next system and as soon as he had me pointed they would come through and pad their KB.  The PVP in this game is only appealing to people who get a kick out of ruining other players' experiences.  If I want a PVP experience I'll play a game where there is a reasonable expectation of balance/expression of skill, which is not Eve 99% of the time.
---
why are people scared of probes when all it takes is dscan to find someone
---
When I kill a new bro, I instantly feel absolutely filthy and send them a load of compensation and an apology.  
---
That you have carried out this callous act at least 999 fucking times is, frankly, worrying.  Could you please share some insight into your personal circumstances and state of mind?  What sort of monster are you?!
---
Amarr Freighters - with the right skin (and there are some deeply sexy ones)  every time you put your Provi or Ark into warp, you can shout 'First Transport Away!"
---
Crop Rotation, when space won't be enough for the big coalitions goodbye small ones they will take your space for crop rotation :)
---
as always things hit the small guys not the big guys...
---
I agree with the Blackout being a "cash grab".
---
&gt;But this is an extremely small niche, and something that it could still do perfectly fine if it had a bit more dps. Give it two more drones and it would be fine.  
---
&gt;I guess it just seems like most of the ships I want to fly, are horribly outclassed in 1 v 1
---
The blackout changes aren't really good for me. If they banned caps in anoms, undid rorqs, and a lot of other economic balancing I'd be happy. In terms of player count the game was a lot healthier imo around 2004-2008, some dropping counts some good to me ;p Prob not good for CCP though.
---
exactly but funfact THE GOONSWARM will be like devouring swarm from stellaris, will be hilarious times hehehe.
---
IMO, if a citadel blows up, all the stuff inside it should aswell?
---
Or maby this is terrible for some reason idk.
---
Not sure how to take this from a guy with "nerf cyno" pom-poms. Go yell at someone until they give up on you and stop talking. You know, the usual man-child stuff you do.
---
Think they are buffing it to a million SP - saw that somewhere
---

---
omfg I just realised I've been subscribed to this dude without even knowing it and wondered why he sounded so familiar in this eve series
---
Yes that is right any Wartarget is free to be shot at in High Sec without CONCORD interference! ;)
---
There is faction Police though which will shoot opposing Factions in High Sec (they are quite easy to deal with since they aren´t godlike like Concord). If you enlist for Amarr/Caldari FW and enter Gallente/Minmatar Space they will try to kill you.
---
I returned after 6 years away and was in a station in 0.0 that used to belong to my alliance ASCN. I messaged the Corp Commander and asked if they wanted an old vet in their Corp but they weren't accepting members, but he did say I could leave their space with my stuff.   
---
Then they blew up my freighter when I was leaving. There's PvP, there's banking, and then there's just being a douche.
---
The C4 sites actually properly remote rep now. Not sure if the C3s do.
---
Alpha's can't do PI
---
Indeed. And the different bloodline gave you very, very different appearances/feels to your characters.
---
Wow people in this thread are giving you a lot of shit for not being super mega ultra elite skill everything but still trying to Wormholer^(btw).
---
Thoughts on Rattlesnakes, Wormholes, and Drones:
---
* There are actually 3 variants of every drone: T1, T2, and Navy (or 'Faction'). The Navy drones have slightly less damage than the T2 drones, but don't require T2 skills and are much more durable, so if your drones get shot ever (which they do in C3 sites), they can survive and you can pull them home.
---
* T2 Heavy Drone training takes a while. I've been living in JSpace for the last year, and I still don't have T2 Heavy drones. Never stopped me from doing anything. (T2 Mediums though, get those.)
---
* The Rattlesnake in particular works best when paired with a single special drone, the Gecko. The Gecko is a double-size Heavy drone, with T1 skill requirements but more damage and HP than any two Heavy drones combined, and the flight speed of a Medium drone. They cost about 100mil, but because the Snek only has a 50Mbit drone bandwith, it can only fly one of them to begin with so it only needs one. Failing that though, Caldari Navy Wasps are pretty sweet little things.
---
* Trying to solo C3 sites in a Gila or Rattlesnake is entirely doable. However, the Rattlesnake required to do it gets pretty expensive pretty fast; the Gila's smaller size means it can dodge some of the incoming damage, while the Rattlesnake *needs* to facetank everything coming at it. If you want to continue your current playstyle, I would recommend actually sticking with the Gila and just upgrading the fit and your skills to reduce the danger margin.
---
* Moving on to C4 sites solo really isn't a thing; there's a large jump in the DPS and Neutralizer pressure between C3 and C4 combat sites, and while you can build Snek fits that can handle C4 sites, those fits are easily priced in the billions. And because pretty much all C4 sites have enemies that warp disrupt you, once you're in you're probably not getting out without killing the site. I say 'solo' because there's a common strategy of using groups of either 2 Rattlesnakes or 3 Nestors, all fitted with Remote Capacitor Transmitters, to run C4 and C5 combat sites. (However, this does require 2-3 pilots, and the Sneks are quite a bit more expensive than your Gila. Totally worth it though.)
---
* Spam DScan harder
---
* Ignore anyone who says you don't belong in a wormhole
---

Hey someone needs to teach noobs what lowsec and 0.0 mean. Especially when you just fly in with a shit fit. 
---
Thats EvE. There is no shame in that. He isn't claiming to be a pvp god. Hes happy he hit 999 killmarks. And he still could have ran into someone more dangerous then him and managed not to. So his prey may not have been a threat but the environment and other players still would have been. 
---
The only shame would have been had he put mining lasers on this thing.

I am taking a break, my two accounts are alpha and sitting on enough plex to start back up when I want to. All 6 chars on them have IV/IV PI skills and make more than 4B a month, 
---
I am seeing what the early progression of a new player is like for the next two weeks,  I want to see what it’s like, because my original character was started in 2007, and my alt account got started with all the DLC packs under galaxy, so I never got the new player experience.

Pve shakes?

You can still do sites in a classic 100mn vexor.

/u/ccp_falcon Hilmar needs to see this ASAP. This is the change he's been looking for. This will usher Eve into a new golden age.
---
That was one time and it cleared up yesterday.
---
Sounds a bit like some of the effects of rigging.
---
This will fit the narrative of making eve dangerous again.
---
But it goes against the circlejerk of the VERY vocal minority who would scream so loud you’d hear them across the world if they did this.
---
The argument for wormholes has *always* been “buh no perfect intel huehuehruehue” because of no local.  Now it’ll be a new excuse.  
---
The scariest part is ccp falcon will listen to them...
---
After undocking from a lowsec station to a lowsec citadel, I was suddenly unable to dock because my fitting stopped recognising the 3x Expanded cargoholds I had equipped, bringing my cargo down from 330k\~ to 162k. As a result I was unable to dock my jump freighter and had to utilise the cargo deposit feature to dock before I was tackled. It doesn't stop there, once docked I was unable to change ship, and add or remove modules to the fitting. Even after relogging it was impossible to reship and fitting window would stay black.

I'll defer to your experience.
---
God damnit
---
Wasn't this what racial lines did in character selection originally (correct me if I'm wrong, I think this was removed before I started playing)?
---
Lololol
---
spend 5 minutes in rookie help and you'll be shocked that anyone understands how to turn on their computer, my dude.
---
and promptly get banned (src - old corp logi guy got banned for this)
---
Hey man , thank you for your response.
---
I really wish that people would be more like you. Im a new player and its normal that i dont have everything skilled to perfection.
---
I will continue using a gila and bought a rattlesnake because heck..its a new ship and its fun to have new ships.
---
Will follow your advices :)
---
They are quite vocal on the eve-o forum, and they are singing the same tune they did ten years ago. 
---
But it seems things are changing at CCP, probably  caused by pressure from their owner and Hilmars ideas of where to take the game; better tech, better new player experience and making the game scary again.
---
Half an hour... not disappointed or surprised. Good work tho
---
if you lost a vni to a rifter you should leave
---
Yeah I managed to escape to my pod after relogging, but even though the inventory window shows I have entered the ship, I cannot access the fitting and the visuals still show me in the pod. 
---
A little later I logged back in and I can get in the JF but the cargo expanders are offline and cannot be removed or onlined.
---
Both of those where done as explained in the post above. I logged in again and the expanders cannot be onlined or removed on the jf.
---
Considering how many people are telling you that your ideas fucking retarded, you might want to reflect on what that makes you. Regardless of your salary :)
---
Integrating it into what?
---
Having been on an endless number of INIT whaling fleets, I can speak to their effectiveness, if not any of the other ones you mentioned. 
---
Stukas were a big success at first because they could take advantage of wormhole shortcuts even with massive numbers, and were thought to be extremely tough to fight or defend against. As it turns out, the answer to Stukas is just to bring 30, 40 carriers with FAX support, which every sizeable alliance now is capable of. Then, heavy stukas were introduced (Nagas), and while they deliver more damage, they are also *extremely* difficult to get into position, requiring a friendly titan to infiltrate deep into enemy territory and provide bridging services, because they can't fit through wormholes. And again, the answer is just bringing more caps to the fight. INIT is an alliance that combines massive numbers with good overall skill, so if even they can't reliably score kills in hostile territory, then nobody can be expected to.

RIP w-space
---
dont let people pick your play style me personally i under stand with out the miners i wouldn't have ships to get blowed up as for the pvp stressing you out i used to feel that way i dont even get the shakes now days
---
Today, we salute you, Mr. Thousand-Minus-One-Killmark Phantasm Guy
---
Not taking the bait! I'm impressed! 👍
---
the so and so is a enemy go away is because there sec status is to low like mine tends to run around -3 so i see it a lot
---
Into spreadsheets. Cereles is fine and good. But I didn't find a way to bring that data in for further work. Granted, I'm no dev.
---
&gt;i
---
Then choose a different ship?  as mentioned its not built as a 1 vs 1 monster.
---
Can you repackage the JF?
---
And the first thing he teaches new player is to disable wheel menu... Do NOT disable wheel menu! It's much more convenient and intuitive than right click and scroll through tiny tabs. I avoided wheel menu like a plague before I went away from the game a few years, now I'm back and my prejudice are gone I can't imagine myself play without the quick wheel menu. It just makes everything much much easier. Have to right click everything is definitely a turn down for new players.
---
Just tried it and it seemed to work!
---
What's that ship even good for
---
Good at sorry**
---
How big is that? A4?
---
To be fair, Unspoken isn't very small when they generally fly with 3 to 4 other medium/small alliances like Centipede and Rote. I don't disagree with the assessmentz but the source is leaving out some key info.
---
Defending sov is easier with a lot of friends on speed dial.
---
&gt; Hello - I’m beta testing a game similar to eve on mobile (it’s called Second Galaxy) 
---
Nice Ad, do you think anyone will notice?
---
Man, that would scare the crap outta me if I couldn't dock my JF.
---
best place would be market i would think but im going to guess and say eve unie would have a good list to start with https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Blueprints
---
It's a great game op, if you're looking for people to fly with and a great newbie environment with lots to do then you should come join brave. We have fun roams and strategic fleets along with great exploration space for newbies and safe krabbing space (krabbing is just killing NPCs for ISK) we also do wormhole day trips if you'd prefer that and have a wormhole Corp if you'd like to move into one later.

o/ Volunteering for the position of mentor.
---
I'll gladly fly with you for a few hours, guiding you and answering any questions you might have. I have a few things I like taking all newbros through, but I'll mostly just help you do whatever you want.
---
You should probably repackage so you don't accidentally undock in it!
---
lol thats the sprit all tho most good wh groups wont do that its a broadcast that some one is in system that needs to be killed
---
&gt; I could ride down the road with my mouth open and I'm sure within a year or two I'd catch 999 bugs in it.
---
Classic!
---
Don't let the haters get ya down.
---
&gt; In Second Galaxy, for example, if I was a free to play (besides the $4 monthly fee)
---
&gt; There's a currency only available with real money. You can use it to advance your pilot's skills. It would take a lot of real money to completely do this, rather then play and skill up. There is a starter pack pass that looks like it may retail for $10.00. There are loot boxes
---
&gt; They need to work on the English translations
---
&gt; Hope the developer tries to grow the playerbase and avoid pay
---
Game sounds like shit dude. Like an even worse EVE with no reprieve from the cancer. Eve at least has some redeeming qualities.
---
Oy hes, it's mapped to my MMB with no delay, I use it all the time, so great.
---
Huh, I always thought all watercolours were dull, lifeless and generic but you proved me wrong.
---
Did you purchase a hauling permit?
---
The rorq is fine.
---
The ability to have hundreds of the most powerful ship in the game instantaneously teleport to your location is not fine.
---
die in a fire please
---
What are you trying to do? There's ton's of tools out there already pre-built. If you're more specific on what you're looking for someone could point to you one.

Funny, we are good :)
---
Engineering rigs don't have drawbacks, sometimes not even stacking penalties.
---
Does that matter? People boast about killing ratters regardless of if they are in VNI's, Domi, Myrmidons, Carriers, Supers or Rorqs. Every day someone is asking for a fit that let's them go ratter hunting, I don't think hunting mission runners any different.
---
My man, nice job. I made it through the first gate and got podded warping into the second. My dumbass learned random celestials the hard way
---
Good stuff.
---
WarGames - The only winning move is not to play.
---
Join eve university Corp or pandemic horde
---
Because nullsec is supposed to be a high risk, high reward place. Making it safer than hisec means that either it should have hisec's rewards or that it should be riskier.
---
Personally, I'm asking that CCP does something about capital application to subcaps so that sending a super to fight off cruisers is simply not a good idea for the same reason that you'd never send a battleship or 2 to fight off a frigate gang and expect to win. This has been part of the game's balance since the beginning and cap+ completely wrecked this balance, which was fine when they were rare, but they're so common now that it's having a true impact.

Shots fired! 😮
---
Do you even know what game this is?
---
What he said, and watch youtube videos you can learn the basics of the game from pvp to indy by just watching a few vids. The game is best played with a group if you do end up playing join one of those two groups anyways.
---
But it's not fair that my VNI was ganked by a single cloaky Loki. I want that CONCORD be deployed to nullsec and they blap off every neutral that enter in system so that I can make the dankest ticks safely. Also, buff anomalies so that I make billions of ISK per hour with 0 risk, so that I can jerk off at my huge pile of Titans that I never use.
---
See, I can do it do.
---
Add me on Discord. I'd be happy to help you, without blowing you up to boot:.  Proxy#9493
---
And how did we resolve this issue? *(Hint: it involved our large trust network)*
---
Yeah, there's a certain irony there. Engineering rigs are what you'd intuitively think is the closest to your idea, but some of the turret rigs trade cap-usage for fitting cost.
---
Hello - I’m beta testing my post (on this thread) please help me understand why the fuck I should care about your ~~low key~~ advertising
---
Who are you again?
---
And yet if I were to post about how I met MY goal of mining and building my nyx myself, I would undoubtedly get many people who would give the usual "lol krab so hard mining in delve". Just like you can have an opinion on his goals, so can I.
---
No, excavators can be killed. This even if you can't kill a rorqual you can still punish them.
---
"if it only brings a small improvement"
---
Ah, yes, the concept that makes an eve player happily pay an extra 10x the cost for a 1-2% improvement.
---
It sounds like this is already in the works. The”wormhole-ification” of 0.0.
---
Already moved my BPOs and am working on the rest of my valuables.
