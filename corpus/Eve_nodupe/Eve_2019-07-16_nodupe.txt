I've been wondering about how many arty lokis you need to alpha a ratting carrier.

The weird thing about covert cynos is... despite everything else, they actually feel, y'know, covert now, and I like that.  This is different from them only having a duration advantage over regular cynos, because people will know when you arrive anyway.
---
---
---
HTFU is the perfect phrase for this. It doesn't require much more thought or effort into it. The game changes. You have to adapt. Eve has been notorious for it's epic skill curve and not one to hold your hand. As an avid wormholer/current nullsec player of 10 years, I can honestly say I haven't had this much fun in years.
---
That's an opinion. The game is a sandbox which means we make of it what we want. And we MADE it safe.
---
For one, its harder to keep sov. Secondly I wasnt talking about sov in that sense, I was asking whos gonna live there in the end? Cause very few are hardcore enough to maintain everything on their own. A lot of it is done by krabbers you know?
---
Enough stabs can counter 2-3 tacklers. You can also add ECM drones or module for 1-2 more.
---
Remove stabs and you go from 3-5 to 1-2 and that is if you are lucky with ECM drones.
---
Stabs are fine, they are the only thing that allows people who just want to travel to do just that, PVPers should and can fit to counter it if they really want the kill.
---
If I wanted to get peoples attention I'd write a post about the RMTing GSF Director or the TEST strat FC who sells INTEL to goons in return for PLEX.

But were just trying to  have some wholesome fun with a silly vendetta lossmail VoV
---
\&gt;  We said this was temporary 
---
"Indefinite" includes both "temporary" and "permanent."
---
If I was you I would move into an astero, make sure probes are set up to show on dscan, orbit the can at 2500 and check dscan often. I would also make sure after scanning the system down to pull your probes, the blackout means that while you don‚Äôt know if someone is around, they also don‚Äôt know you are - all this along with being quick to escape gives you the advantage over the hunter.
---
I know my "real life" has been doing much better without EVE sucking up all my time and energy.  It smells suspiciously like freedom.
---
Nullsec is supposed to be dangerous is a fact. That‚Äôs why local is blacked out. The next step is removing asset recovery from nullsec.
---
Your post is riddled with opinions and assumptions. What players are not logging in? what were they doing? I do not believe for a moment you have even the slightest clue as to factual information to answer these questions. Your opinions based on assumptive answers to these questions are particularily useless.
---
I can't tell if this is a humblebrag or not can you just put it in your next AAR?
---
They shouldn't see them unless they're blue. The fact anyone can come along and tag into sov structure upgrades had always been dumb in my opinion.
---
You don't see those anoms until the right stuff is plugged into ihub, so non blues shouldn't see them.
---
I told a goon weeb what kind of anime Asher was looking for and he gave me 400m. Still trying to figure out a business model to exploit this.
---
No no ofc, I dont think people will kill eachother irl because of what happens ingame (even if scary shit happens at times). But ingame it feels like people want to wipe out other playstyles, like hate with a passion. It doesnt work, there has to be mutual respect for eachother and the willingness to atleast talk to eachother and accept that certain things might not work. Compromises. Otherwise it becomes ingame genocide if you know what I mean, more players will leave and we all get fked. Thats just sad.
---
If they won't give us the 30 seconds, at least give us until we uncloak.
---
Sounds like a bug.
---
join horde
---
Aka the biggest mistake in eve
---
You will save EVE!

What are these out of game tools that report hostiles 3 regions out?  Are they the same ones I've been hearing about in the gaming press that provide intel out of the local channel?  Because I'm pretty sure that the only ones in use that are not TOS violations are things like NEAR2 that scrape your intel chat and provide an extra warning if hostiles are reported within a certain number of jumps to your location.  This is just convenience, people seeing you reported 3 regions away is a function of intel channels and blue donuts.  Which are all in game issues.
---
I can write a sonnet about it if you want
---
&gt; 14 supercarriers and 1 titan have died in the 3 days since the blackout,
---
Thats actually not at all unusual, 12 died on the 5th through the 7th (the previous) weekend.  A 2 ship difference is fundamentaly insignificant.  In other words its a terrible example, you make it sound unusual, its not.
---
Well, don't forget that covert cynos can also pierce cyno jamming. That's a big part of their utility, too.
---
Good, at least those wannabe supercap hunters will get their T3 lost SP back.
---
Not really, you can still move them, you just can't cyno them in wherever and whenever you want.
---
Blitzing burners can be fun and lucrative compared to many other PVE activities.
---
So krabber should have a get out of jail free card and bot protection? As a krabber not we shouldn't it is null sec, it shouldn't ever be that safe to just farm to our content in null sec. 
---
No local != harder to keep sov no local = need to do more scouting, intel gathering, be more aware than just waiting for a loud noise to let you know local has increased by +1
---
Wwhhhhyyyy!?
---
No probs. Remove cloaks and recon from the game and d-scan will work so no worries. Willing to accept that?
---
I wouldn't say "very long" all my friends and Corp mates and allot of others I play with have quit until it's lifted. 
---
I almost have no reason to play anymore because you took away the aspect that was fun to me, my friends.
---
So at least give us some estimate of how long we are looking at time wise.
---
&gt;You can afk bot in carriers and even supers just as easily as you can in a VNI
---
Do you even play the game?  Do you have any idea how much micro is required to run 3 squads of fighters in an anom, much less 5 on a super?  The craziest multiboxers I know can run two carriers on two screens, and they lose more fighters and get less then 2x ticks.  It's also mentally exhausting.
---
The only way you can afk rat a capital is to use an actual bot program.  And that's straight up cheating and needs to be killed with fire.
---
"Pleeeease. We have families to feed."
---
Null bears do not ruin the game. They just ruin YOUR game.
---
Yeah, I'm all about the story, and this story is wrecked.
---
If it's anything like your AAR please
---
i used some google-translation for those hatemails, those seem juicy!
---
literally how i've been getting fights and brawls up until this gay event
---
I used to rat in subs because 10 ishtars was less korean level adhd then carrier or super ratting. Titan ratting was the least effort but a missed boson fucked your ticks up. I sure as fuck not going to undock 8 rorquals where I had moons to mine without any form of verifying its semi safe to even begin to start cycling. I also still paid sub time and occasionally bought bulk plex packs to supplement income/ not make it where I had to live on eve making isk.
---
The starter pack costs ¬£1 and you get 7 days omega, 250k sp, an accelerator, I think 4 skins and two pieces of clothing, so sp wise your getting about 750k sp so that's about 700m isk for ¬£1, you can get as many codes as you like, the discount is 75% only shows up on final checkout screen. It might be over by the time you read this.
---
Oh right, for some reason I keep thinking capitals (outside of freighters and industrials) can't use Stargates.
---
Schrodinger's forever?
---
Did you cry about losing your free intel from zkill?
---
This time, i agree with every single word.
---
About exhumers, i always had an idea, take this free laugh for you:
---
What if exhumers were "modular" hulls like T3's are, and we could plug stuff on it, like subsystems. Those "subsystems" would be related to yield, tanking, speed, drone capacity.
---
I say this because the perfect exhumer is something more tanky than mackinaw and carry more than Skiff.
---
(:
---
Well yeah, it's an ecosystem isn't it? We needs wolves, and sheep, and sheepdogs and whatever else doesn't fit into this metaphor. Maybe people are a bit snippy, and the PvPers definitely need to have the others in game to keep the population up and to have folk to feed on/protect respectively. I wouldn't expect the hunters to ever really get on well with the others, there is always going to be some contention between them.  
---
Anyway, in generally I think we actually agree more than we disagree. That's rare enough that I just wanted to say, thanks for not being a dick. Hah! o7
---
I can usually find a way to monetize my occasional drunken jita rants. Once staged a public suicide in hek for an audience, questioned a man's devotion to milk and made a piddling amount of cash off the ensuing strange argument. People want to be entertained, hit enough people in the funny bone and donations can and do come in. Sort of like being a busker or something.
---
All the bots logged off and real players resubbed
---
Exactly, people pay for bots, and there are bots to solve all kinds of issues, there is no quick fix to bots.
---
The very fact that wormhole space is essentially dead should be a big tell. When the shine wears off this, people will realise it does not fix the real and serious issues facing Eve right now. Removing local does nothing but make people put more effort into a game that already requires an insane amount of effort to play compared to many others. It needs to be reversed.
---
Me too üòÅ
---
vOv
---
Oh, wasn't it?
---
Yes, they made a successful MMO that has lasted 16 years.
---
Please dont label super twinkey as S2N, he was a D00M FC Tri mk1/2/3.
---
&gt;It is like, motherfuckers, you could have been doing this for years. Local had nothing to do with it.  
---
  
---
To be fair, they could take a gang out to go roam.... but they would get reported once they entered *XxxX* space on intel channels, someone would wake up and dscan them (probably by accident looking for rocks) and then a couple titans would sit on a gate on their likely route until **delet delet**.    
---
I agree that the anecdotes of people roaming are very much played up.
---
I'm never going to sell those Multiple Pilot Training Certificates they suckered me into getting, am I?
---
You think your camp wouldn‚Äôt be obliterated by an umbrella if you started to make an annoyance of yourselves? :rolleyes:
---
Like what's happening right now?
---
Actually, if OP only has 6 months of sub (averaging a month subbed out of every 18), and DnDstuffs has 3 years consistently (wild guess), that means that DnD's sub has a higher financial value to CCP as a client. Multiply as required for alts.
---
Seems weird with rewards for login during the blackout. Will it not will make it harder to measure the effect?
---
Would move some of that Plex I hear everyone saying is to much of in game.
---
Kiss goodbye to the game with that idea. There are already some nails going in the coffin, making it harder for people to make isk will destroy the game.
---
Don‚Äôt forget, Eve already requires more effort than almost any other MMO out there. Whether it be time invested, playing or learning.
---
If your daddy is the right person you can get a job creating peace in the middle east.  No qualifications required!
---
MIC DROP
---
This is not a very effective way to communicate this.
---
Sure make anyone involved in logistics hate you
---
Nope.  Again I'll say that I'm not good enough at words because my point didn't come across.
---
Null needed a shakeup.  The whole game needs....something.  I had a few ideas about some minor tweaks here and there, like removing aggressive mode from ships with drone damage bonuses and making excavator drones more like fighters that have to be micro managed, but honestly I can't be arsed to write about them anymore because I don't care enough anymore.
---
But speaking as a long time EVE player that plays ALL aspects of the game, pve and pvp, what they've done is manifestly unfair.  There was a balance of risk, and with capitals with overwatch fleets being the new meta the risk was balanced the wrong way.  But just removing local and leaving all the other statistics that lets people see what you are doing anywhere in null within 15 minutes is just not fair.  And the "HTFU, it's your turn beaaatch!" flack coming from both the squeaky wheels in the community AND the devs says EVE is now headed in a direction I don't want to go, where every pilot is judged only by his killboard and "carebears" need not apply.  EVE was already like that in it's early years and when it broke out of that rut is arguably when it had its greatest popularity.  I feel like the "hardcore" faction got together and got their buddy at CCP to throw all the nullsec PvE people into the shark pool, after spending years getting them to move out of highsec and into null.
---
To make matters worse, none of this will have a positive effect on the real problems the game has.
---
By making a sandbox and letting players create engaging content for each other, not by being good at planning.
---
No.
---
People keep screaming about concurrent players being down. I guarantee HUNDREDS of those accounts are bot accounts because their scripts dont work. 
---
Looks like null actually became dangerous again instead of being krabbing safe havens and players are gonna have to rely on each other for intel and actually be using dscan actively playing the game.
---
Blackout is literally countered by being active while playing. The only downside to this is excavators are gonna die easier so if we keep the blackout maybe buff their speed or tank.
---
you're painfully stupid and i pity you
---
Ah. Okay.
---
On a related but separate note: I think people acting like blackout "fixes" all the problems of pvp in null are delusional.
---
I just spent a few hours in nullsec and didn't find a single fight until I warped to the other side of a gate into a bubble, got bumped and then full ecm/disrupted while I just watched my tank go away.
---
Which I would hesitate to call a "fight" tbh. There was very little counterplay on my part. All I could do is try and mwd and cloak to get through it and they just bumped me and that's the end of that story. Now, I'm not saying gate camping is "bad" or "toxic" or anything stupid like that, but I feel like Blackout hasn't really changed the dynamic of null pvp in any meaningful way. It's still super feast or famine. You're either helpless or you're dominating. There's no middle ground for a good fight.
---
On day 2 of the blackout, some tapi dinobrains master baited and dunked on a 1.5 billion isk WH proteus and 800 mill worth of Odins call ships, including a Zealot, an Otherus and a Stiletto. 
---
Us nullbears should live in fear of deadly Wormholers, who will hunt and slaughter krabbing ships mercilessly while we keep on doing what we have always done without changing tactics at all.
---
If you enjoyed this so much. Why aren't you in Wormhole space doing this to your hearts content?  I feel the lack of people in wormhole space speaks volumes to the fact that null will also end up empty due to this change. There is a reason why different locations have different properties of safety. At some point if mining in null is almost impossible except in super umbrellas then there won't be any ships and modules to fly around to kill because the price of them will be to expensive for anyone to afford. Just my 2 cents.
---
It literally looked exactly like that
---
Do the ship kills also include ships killed by rats? Or is that strictly ships killed by players?
---
Np o7.
---
He was exceptional, but spent most of his time following xangelx from one star system to the next trying to sex her up in RL, in fact I think he did.
---
Dude I laughed out loud when you went to loot the bomber wreck with hammers on your ass. Nice vid!
---
That‚Äôd be bold of them.
---
Before assets were stuck in a station.  You either sat on it for very long time until your folks moved back into that area or you fire sale.  You shouldn't lose all your shit.  They should increase ISK cost of asset safety.  I personally use WHs and Covert Ops cynos to empire.  You get valuable space.  Most of the loot from structures would get used in an alliances srp fund anyway.
---
Read the announcement news. It literally says temporary.
---
You're not 100% safe. You can always pop up a bubble.
---
I just said deal with it if they decide to do it. I mean, yeah, for sure: if a nullsec krab/pvp-pilot or FC has to deal with it why should the other big bloc of pvp-players/krabs FCs not deal with that? I didnt explain why it should be changed... but i also see no argument why it should stay as it is... camps/baits and so on is no 'FW' only thing... so thats for sure not a better argument than my 'deal with it if it happens'. I mean the krabs that unsubbed said the same shit before the blackout XD so why the hell not? If it is shit... okay... but why not test something that was 'succesfull' (not 100% but hey... nobody is perfect) in a similar area of the game?
---
No local is not the ultimate solution but it could be the beginning.
---
And last but not least: what exactly is the big argument against 'no local'? more D-scanning while you are plexing? Not to see how many players are currently in a system? The need to play with others?
---
FW itself wont be really affected. PvP in lowsec for sure.... but plexes? As i said before: new limits for access... maybe exclude covops. Make the plex itself better for the FW bros.
---
And everything else? I mean it works in WHs, it works in null... why not in low? I lived there for 5 years... im in nullsec since 3 years. And i love the blackout and think it could bring the same amount of fun and risk to a (in my opinion) static area of the game. Even hunters have to care about what could enter their system....
---
And yeah different areas have different residents and so on.... you are right. But as you said: sometimes changes are needed even if it is aimed at your playstyle.
---
Better rewards, harder plex limits for FW, no local... more teamplay instead of alibi FW-corps. Maybe this is exactly what makes new players stay with FW instead of joining the next big nullsec or WH corp.
---
We need a short life JF cyno that mitigates jump fatigue that can be lit anywhere , vs capital / general cynos. Could help start to filter what can jump where
---
You‚Äôre only betting on bringing in returning players.  Keeping current players especially new players is gonna be a headwind.
---
Anti-camping AND a decloak mechanism. i'm a fan of the local blackout especially in regards to the #1 point of SNR. 
---
I do absolutely hate the concept of cloaky camping as a valid tactic for a few players though to shutdown a system without a valid counter-attack.
---
Oh thank Bob
---
You no longer need to keep cloaky campers logged in all day.  It's pointless.
---
Looks like they solved that problem.
---
[gotme](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/strawman)
---
Then don't go into a pvp environment if pvp is not for you.
---
Who said that?  Test didn‚Äôt
---
You can have PvP at any time. Just have to wait for the other person to nut up and bring it.
---
ON a serious note, you're just being stupid now
---
Wait until minerals dry up and your rorqual time is worth double what it is now.
---
[removed]
---
&gt;and it's more likely that both sides will think they  have a hidden asset to turn the fight.
---
Or they will both assume the other side has another ace up their sleeves and do not engage because they think it will be an unwinnable encounter once it gets rolling.
---
You had that before but now even less.  It‚Äôs literally you played with 80 of 100 people.  The 20 you despise are gone and you‚Äôre left with the 80.  
---
But some of that 20 helped keep adms up and minerals on the market.  
---
Have fun playing with fewer people.
---
And if low sec were even a fraction of the rewards you‚Äôd find content you‚Äôre selling there.
---
Fair is not the same as net zero, so no, it's not the same thing at all.
---
Removing perfect intel on system activity along with local chat is not net zero. Null still gets more dangerous.  And I stand by calling it unfair without making changes elsewhere.
---
I guess we'll just see. Personally I think they're just trying to give it time to sink in while you're all just writhing about and sperging.
---
Its sad really. Eve has always been a complicated thing allowing everyone to find their own place. A fresh of air in a gaming world that pretty much always restricts players.
---
Now these guys want more restrictions, making Eve into a battle royale game.
---
Wormhole space is far from dead. You can log in any night and find someone in your chain to shoot.
---
I prefer to keep it at a 5 degree angle ;D
---
Aww now Im sad. Meanie with stupid comments on the internet said mean things:(
---
&gt;Do you have any idea how much micro is required to run 3 squads of fighters in an anom, much less 5 on a super?
---
Sure don't, but your point is taken. I'm not insinuating that someone can just as easily afk rat in a VNI as they can a super without assistance from a script.  What I am saying, is that scripts are available for supers to those who are determined to make isk without actively managing the accounts.
---
meat popsicles.
---
Plot twist- Structure restores local only for owning sov alliance. üòà
---
Eve isn't dying fast enough drive the stake deeper
---
It still has to land on grid, get in range, and lock you.
---
Would say that there honestly isnt any fix. And people should just stop bitching about it and pretending like everyone should accept a change like no local by using an argument as its bad for bots. All games have bots, no one has managed to fix it. CCP wont either.
---
Ewww  hell no lol.
---
Past 2 days been clicking that stupid dscan and its boring as hell, its like pushing a button for move a leg, so if you want to move...  so no thats a relly stupid mecanic.
---
But hey  if you guys like it,   have fun o7
---
Your oblivious to how many bots were being used, 5k is a conservative estimate. I hope the Krabs come back. Just want the bots gone for good.
---
I don't see a denial. I see some tactful diplomacy to calm the mob
---
Possible. There's a lot of unique content in lowsec depending on what PvE people want to do. 
---
I lived in low when I first played Eve, hated it. Probably down to the group I was with, mainly I just don't like gate guns
---
DEAR GOD, MAKE IT SO
---
Scouts on gates mang, guards or people looking to fight running patrols. proper intel. 
---
Seriously you think d-scan is the only defense to no local? Man I am starting to think you don't know how playing the game works outside of krabbing and watching local.
---
Never said it wasn't unfair before.  I did specifically say that I thought the game was getting stale and needed changes.  I just think the way this has been done was "full retard" in the other direction.
---
As far as still using Dotlan and zkill, 15 minute delayed information on jumps and ship kills is not very useful to me unless I'm living in deep null, because with all this information visible the system I'm in shines like a great big beacon that says "PvE stuff to kill here". 
---
People seem to miss that the main argument seems to be, "oh, there's an easy counter to this, just make sure you are under your cap umbrella" when consolidation and cap proliferation is literally the biggest complaint out there and *this change only forces people to play that way*. Or just quit.
---
As EVE has gotten safer over time, have the player counts gone up, or down?
---
There's no shortage of safe PvE MMO's on the market that EVE has to compete with.  Maybe it should go back to being a niche MMO with a PvP focus.
---
Well when they made rorqs insanely hard to kill and able to ‚Äúinvincible ‚Äú a mining fleet it felt like they were favoring one side. 
---
When they boosted nul-sec anoms it felt like they were favoring one side.
---
When they nerfed t3c align time it felt like they were favoring one side.
---
When they re-did the moon mining mechanics, it felt like they were favoring one side.
---
When they made skill injectors a thing, it felt like they were favoring one side.
---
I mean the list can go on for a long time describing changes that grossly favored sides EXCEPT small-mid size pvp/hunting. The way the game is played now is literally forcing the people that made this game great out of the type of gameplay that is engaging. Aka something besides anchor and f1. 
---
I know most people probably don‚Äôt care about my opinion, but when you have people who multi-box supers, mining fleets, SB BS to rat at the same time because it is literally so safe they don‚Äôt have to pay attention (as someone said earlier in this thread). Well then my friend 0.0 is beyond to safe. 
---
Some of the most dangerous things in eve have become the safest, and it has to change.
---
doesn't sound like it from todays news.  sounds like its old iteration is officially dead.
---
I like either of those options
---
Running trig filaments has mostly replaced mission running for me.
---
&gt;  We cant say we dislike something so they should get bent.
---
I can and I will. If this makes Rorqual mining unprofitable, all the better for the game.
---
Seems like an idea that would lead to Imperium, Legacy and PanFam smashing the little guys loot pinatas.
---
I'm coming home!
---
Something else happened at the same time that had a much bigger effect. 
---
Here is a hint: [https://youtu.be/1pp3U8BDK-c?t=205](https://youtu.be/1pp3U8BDK-c?t=205)
---
Inb4 perimeter gets hit and y'all are crying
---
&gt; It makes people who live in null who's primary focus is PvE think that the devs have decided the game doesn't need or want them.
---
I built a 1.5b barghest to rat in. Every single module on it was made with a clear goal in mind - to make a ratting ship that you could never catch. It worked extremely well. Even without local, I believe it would hold up.
---
It hasn't left the station in weeks though, since I do not feel like losing it to instalocking, instapointing and instagibbing rats with no prior warning. My sub is has lapsed today.
---
Yes. See [https://youtu.be/1pp3U8BDK-c?t=205](https://youtu.be/1pp3U8BDK-c?t=205)
---
&gt; Never seems to last. Two years ago it was goons and PLNC. Why does NC. have the dot? What happened to BoB? Where's PL?
---
Notice how it always involved goons though.
---
Yup, quick look at eve-offline shows it to be true.
---
IMO it is a dumb time for CCP to test it though. Summer historically has lower player counts and people are probably looking for a reason to go out and not do eve, so this pushes people who were not yet stopping for the summer to stop.
---
A winter test would have been better.
---
You're right, people who've been logging in have fun.
---
I personally do not log in.
---
OwO what's this?
---
And you know they're predicting it accurately how? Do you have 2020 vision or can I borrow your precognition spectacles?
---
I don't doubt that eventually bots will be running again but for now they are mostly docked up. It's common knowledge that they rely on local and they were still killable then (with a little persistence), dscan spamming gives way less warning and does nothing against cov ops cloak.
---
Wouldn't you say that IS planning though?
---
You can? Buy PLEX, sell PLEX, buy injectors.
---
I don't understand the mental gymnastics being performed where people think SP farms are somehow inherently not the same thing as CCP just selling the SP directly.
---
&gt; and it's more likely that both sides will think they have a hidden asset to turn the fight.
---
Literally nobody has "hidden assets" in a fight, small gangs can't afford to leave ships behind to pull a Disney plot move.
---
Pretty sure they're still living in the north and the imperium aren't? Whats your point?
---
Fined for goodposting :japanese_goblin:
---
Learn to PVP? The point of Eve.....
---
Naaaahhhh.
---
Let's not add yet another mechanic that favours alliances with tens of thousands of players. 
---
The fact of the matter is that those alliances of which the health of the game would be improved most by them suffering blackouts, are also the ones which can throw so many ships / pilots at any such problem as to make it immediately irrelevant.
---
can *I* have your stuff?
---
&gt; We said this was temporary in our messaging, and we said this was a test.
---
If people want to get assmad about that, it's on them.
---
Personally, I hope that at some point after the test it becomes permanent, with other changes for nullsec local too, but we'll see.
---
I‚Äôll play until local comes back in any shape or form. Then I unsubscribe again. Playing against automation is not my cup of tea.
---
I won‚Äôt be assmad. Just disappointed.
---
75 upvotes. 214 comments. Sooooo...  not all that popular.
---
But it still would have an effect. Between the time it occurs, and the time takes to clear it, it opens an opportunity to hit those large alliances. 
---
A small window. But a window none the less
---
i can get a frying pan delivered to my door in 24h
---
can't beat that
---
Your friends took themselves away from you. Literally nothing is stopping you all playing together apart from your (apparent) fear of interacting with another player.
---
Damn, that was a cool read.
---
I know many people in my corp have not logged their krabbing alts on, although their mains are still logged on and are participating in pvp of one sort or another. I imagine this will continue for a few more days at least before people feel comfortable enough to log their krab alts back in without having a few dudes cloaked on grid waiting for someone to take the bait.
---
Sweet, you'll be able to get out and get some sun.  The rest of us will be here sitting "in the dark".
---
Don't give them a choice.  Plenty fights like that
---
Someone asked before you. Sorry.
---
My 2 cents - there should be a cost to having blues across an alliance.... don‚Äôt know how it would work but ffs as a group grows there are more and more ‚Äòfriends‚Äô, must be to protect the bears mining and you end up having to go to the middle of nowhere to find a fight.
---
Sucks roaming your local lowsec area and 90% of possible targets are blue to alliance etc..
---
Are we getting those more players long term though?
---
The differences between Null and Wormhole space are huge, and just because the chats currently work the same way doesn't alter the fact that the space and mechanics are utterly different.
---
Mining in null is far from impossible, it's just not the current 95% risk free activity it was. 
---
We've already run into a couple of groups fitting a scram to their procs, with a couple of pvp ships on hand to fight.

RemindMe! 140 days best AAR 2019?
---
The existence or use of cheating methods should not be a basis for balance changes in the game.  Cheating should be killed with fire, full stop.  Nerfing capital ratting because there is too much isk generated by capital ratting when a decent percentage is coming from botting is also something CCP has done, and is also another example of punishing widely to solve a problem caused by a specific problem, because nerfing just requires changing a few database numbers and removing bots is *work*.
---
This posting is the equivalent of the OP's /r/eve-orgasm.
---
I am -10.
---
&gt; Between the time it occurs, and the time takes to clear it, it opens an opportunity to hit those large alliances.
---
It doesn't alter their ability to cyno in a bunch of titans to cast Delete Grid III.
---
how are people this dumb like holy shit, the phoenix is the best HAW dread by a decent margin
---
Don‚Äôt be in nullsec if you want to relax...
---
Every item you get during the career agents you get to keep, although most of them are pretty worthless. Anything with Civilian in the name is a worst version (and sometimes useless) of a very cheap item (ex: Instead of a Civilian Afterburner, you should buy a 1MN Afterburner for a pretty cheap price to go about twice as fast). Most ships that you get are pretty good and some modules are good to keep early on too. Once you're done the career agents though, anything with "Civilian" in the name should be replaced if you plan on actually doing the activity.
---
Me and my small group are salivating at the thought of this change being permanent. We're all waiting with baited breath to see if this is CCP growing a third and righteous testicle. I'd resub if they keep this up, and I won't be the only 15+ year vet to do it.
---
:D
---
Congrats bro!!!
---
Some-ONE- 
---
Indeed.
---
If your freighter gets caught in your home constellation by a logoff bubble you're an absolute buffoon. And your comment about safety just lends more to how strong jump freighters are..... so don't know the point of that comment lol.
---
We won‚Äôt if people know they just have to sit out for a month before coming back. Botters will gladly sit out for a month to skew the numbers if they know this is only temporary.
---
dw, CCP sees this and blackout will probably never be a permanent thing.
---
It‚Äôs great for hunters, but once the prey start to dry up the hunters will start complaining too.
---
Null sec was perfectly fine 5, 6, 7 years ago with no local removal. Let‚Äôs look back to then to see what worked yeah?
---
Now consider the long term ramifications of being unable to set up logistics in nullsec as a small group without powerful allies.
---
You cannot see gangs coming. You cannot see hostiles coming out of a wormhole. You cannot protect each other because you lack the ability to catapult a dozen Titans on top of anything in your turf. You cannot prevent Entosis gangs from taking out your stuff.
---
Unless your plan is to hang out in NPC Null and get Bosoned upon being spotted intruding into Conquerable Null.
---
where is this data from??? how did you do this omg
---
And yet people were praising gate camping. They have to understand that now, reality is somehow different.
---
Now people are going to set up a gate camp, not to get flights but to deny entrance to system. Fun composition could be as well gonne. Those who can afford it, and are in range of their umbrella will go with bosons. Some will go with chemo. Some with go with other combinations.
---
People who aren't living in a totally remote regions will have in harder. People who cannot afford most effective methods of area denial will have it much, much harder.
---
This means that big null blocks can somehow mittigate most of the nerfs. Smaller entities, not so much.
---
super ratting nerf? or was that in summer? i dont remember
---
I certainly didn't think that the current, just-voted-on CSM would be the ones to have any input on this, if indeed there was any CSM input.  The timing is obviously not right.
---
That's assuming that this was a planned feature of the Triglavian Invasion all along, and not a knee jerk reaction to falling player numbers.  The way CCP is acting, I'm not willing to give them the benefit of the doubt.
---
I'm oddly okay with carriers being 'decent' anti support capitals. Mostly because fighters can be jammed &amp; destroyed fairly easily, and then the carrier is largely helpless. 
---
But I would like to see support fighters nerfed pretty damn hard to force carriers to make real choices about tank vs application in their fitting rather than just their loadout.
---
can i have some issk please bby? im about a week new and need isk desperately
---
send to ---&gt; Mas0ny1 P

Leopard cracks 32.4 AU/s with Ascendencies, Pacifier hits 30.4 AU/s with Ascendencies (with two Prototype accelerators, and two faction istabs for a 3sec align). 
---
1.09 LY = 68932.77 AU. 68932.77 AU divided by 32.4 AU/s is 2127.55s, or about 35.46 minutes.
---
Why missiles specifically? Most T1 missiles are pretty easy to manufacture, all you really need is the BPO which is pretty cheap, and the minerals to make it (refined ore). Anyone can make them off the bat, you might just need a few levels of Industry, but nothing too long. 
---
If you want to make ISK though, make sure you're not better just selling the ore. By making the missiles/modules, you'd be competing with people that have maximum industry skills, maxed out BPOs to use the least amount of minerals, making the items in citadels for maximum efficiency. Basically, unless you have access to all of that, you will probably make more money by selling the ore directly in Jita.
---
That's not to say that all T1 items are bad, it's just that you have to do your research and find the item with the biggest profit margin. It will probably be a T2 module of some sort, but you'll have to do your own research to find the items that are worthwhile with your skill set. For T2 though, you'd also need to do invention to get a T2 BPC and they usually have components other than minerals, so the process is longer and more complicated, but there's a better chance that you will actually make profit.
---
Greatest AAR of all times LOL
---
Who are you and why are you posting this?
---
&gt;And you know they're predicting it accurately how? Do you have 2020 vision or can I borrow your precognition spectacles?
---
apparently context is hard, i'm telling him that his assertion is 'reddit gets it wrong' is wrong, because citing ONE time a stupid redditor said, or a literal-who redditor said something wrong doesn't negate the vast majority or 'educated' redditors opinions.
---
reddit isn't wrong, individuals are
---
Lmao whine some more pls
---
LOL YOU ARE THE BEST
---
How can i follow your posts, lol
---
In all in on changes to fw and ls. But I can't see how delayed local is a good change for what lowsec and fleet warfare have been and are.
---
I agree and hate them being used for this purpose, but I think that this is a FW mechanic issue, rather than the stabs themselves.
---
Generally speaking for the rest of the game, fitting these gimps you hard for a lot of other fits.
---
If we could prevent the spam of these affecting the FW outcome separately to a WCS balance, I think that would be preferable.
---
Don't you mean Omni Tracking? Makes sense to have those.
---
*checks fit on zkill*

Ah fuck that. My one remaining account is subbed for years, but I don't get shit except a long skill queue that I'll never put to use unless you guys do a lot more than delay nullsec local.
---
Prove me wrong. Please. I'd prefer to shirk my RL responsibilities for Eve.
---
Haha. Gotta get that faction mse :D
---
You don't get any transferable certificates from this deal. You get two 3 month character training queues on the one account (ie your main and another slot both train for the three months).
---
I'd rather a lower player count and have a higher ratio of people who ACTIVELY play the game.
---
+1 for space piracy being more viable. It's why I originally wanted to play
---
I'm just going to roll my eyes now.
---
Live in safety, go to null. Hilarious really
---
Don't get me wrong, no local forever is dumb, but as something to shake it up, it's not bad for a bit. Once they move on tot he new observatories, I hope it's nerfed local, then the krabs will get used to it and its business a usual, in a slightly more dangerous null
---
You can use Pathfinder or Tripwire to map out the wormholes that you visit to more easily get around.
---
implying anyhone without an umbrella wasnt fucked anyways...
---
yes but one person managed to kill an atron on a gate somewhere so this makes it ok
---
Pretty much sums up every internet forum there :/
---
Ye exactly. And every ecosystem is fragile and one shouldnt push it too far. Within limits so that everything keeps spinning. 
---
Oh most def, we want the same things, just have different opinions. Which is good since I honestly am often wrong and need to learn from smarter people.
---
Pleasure was all mine, o7.
---
Sweet thanks I was always wondering why it did that
---
It's a good way to measure who is paying attention, but not logging into the game. 
---
3 groups of customer
---
1. Not logged in
---
2. Logged in not playing
---
3. Playing
---
This will help measure # 2
---
Alright, at $5.99 usd per platinum reward, that's 69 more platinums to go just to give you my monthly sub cost instead of to CCP.
---
On an unrelated note, holy fuck, I've been spending $400/mo on EVE?! Jesus, not factor in every alt on all 21 accounts is kept up on with MPTC purchased purely in-game.
---
Ha, fucking CCP. What this guy said is correct. At $20 usd per 500 plex, and $20usd per each MPTC, that's *$1,260 per month* gone once I start winning eve.
---
What does the industry call it? Whales?
---
Almost as deleted as the delve gate camping vendetta
---
Just  say the word! blackout is forever!  so many of us can finally move to other games with a good excuse!!
---
With that attitude all youre gonna get is strife instead of real change. Besides rorqs are in a decent place now.
---
This video is terrible. Click approach, mixed guns, reps not staggered correctly. bad form bad form.
---
If they 1/2 the number of skill points to do everything it would help. Really years and years to learn skills in a game is not as applicable anymore. Guarantee they lose a lot of customers due to the time to skill.
---
Game is much more enjoyable with skilled pilots.
---
I literally started playing on my day off yesterday. I just want to say thanks to all those on the rookie chat being very nice. Just figuring out how to set destinations and jump through gates was great.
---
Ah cool, thanks!
---
Well, I purchased a 3 month sub and posted a screenshot of my order confirmation to the subreddit r/eve, so that means it has to last 3 months or you've literally robbed me
---
Yes please !!
---
For the low price of 10000 Plex you can unlock local! Get an edge on the competition!
---
Im gonna reply even though I already consider you to be ignorant. 
---
Are you stupid enough to think that people wont log off in system before hand? Which they can do for a undisclosed amount of time before opening a cyno that buttfucks your entire system.
---
You dont know what youre talking about. Just spouting ignorant shit. Most likely a WHer.
---
Yeah but the undock button was clearly hidden behind local. Now that CCP removed local, everyone found the undock button again!  Thank god this wasnt a psychological thing and truly the result of that undock button being located.
---
Insert resubbing 59 accounts meme here.
---
I only get "mad" when a super or titan is dropped on a 5 person gang. You were never supposed to be dropping those, they were meant as a ship used in major battles or strategic asset assaults/defense. 
---
If you think Supers/Titans are currently well balanced, I don't know what to tell you.
---
Good guys win again
---
Well, people aren't logging in their 50 rorqual alts and are being more careful about PVE, so concurrent players is down.
---
It's really not that complicated.
---
omg concurrent login totally matters when all the numbers are just bots
---
You forget, one must be in null to make supers, one must have supers to be in null.
---
oh look another bad mechanic \~idea\~ thread
---
Which cant track shit anymore. People are like broken clocks, keep on rehashing shit even after changes.
---
As an industrialist, I can agree that there really is no place for a industrialist anymore.
---
Even my best Eve-friend since 2009, a mega-industrialist, has stepped away from the game.
---
It appears our superiority has led to some controversy.
---
"Didn't want to hunt those pve-ers anyway. I don't want them in my game!"
---
The Phoenix needs a range and reload time buff imo. It has less range than other haw dreads other than a Moros, and the reload time is just a little too long.
---
the one in Snuff now?
---
Saying eve requires more effort is not always quite true. Many activities can be done mostly afk and sp accumulates no matter if you play or not
---
We tried to warn you what would happen, but you were too excited at the prospect of killing marginally more stupid Goons than usual to listen.
---
It's an interesting change, but I think any pilot with 2 isk to rub together that isn't just spodflakes or NPC debris will agree it's not a whole fix. You point out the huge amount of intel still available. Sure, that's a big problem that hopefully CCP will resolve soon. Killmails being put on a few hour delay or something would help, too, but I'm never going to be on board with complete removal of KM's as KM's are integral to Eve's history and structure. Either way, as has been pointed out on other threads recently, these delays are something CCP has to do with the code and not try to leave to the 3PD's to do of their own volition. 
---
Structure spam... I mean... it was kinda a foregone conclusion. Ever put up a tower in the old days? How many moons had dead sticks or partial towers still on them? One of the core problems in Eve's design is there is no penalty for me to put 2000(hyperbole) of anything in space if I can afford the initial investment. Sure someone will come along and shoot them eventually, but towers used to sit on moons for years because they weren't worth the trouble to blow up.
---
Really, what needs to happen is a whole list of small changes to rebalance/rebuild the environment. It's waaaayyy too easy to build almost anything in New Eden anymore, even structures. And there is no penalty really for having piles of stuff sitting around. This aspect needs to be changed for Eve to really be brought back into balance, but doing all these small changes is going to make a lot of people angry over the course of doing it. I wouldn't have a couple super carriers just sitting on a pilot I use once every 3 or so months if I had to pay for those ships to be maintained every week, for a quick and easy example.
---
The one ray of light is that Hilmar seems to be aware of more of this these days than he let on in the past, and more willing to make the hard changes that need to be made. Falcon also seems to be taking a bit of a harder line. So, maybe... there's a bit of hope.
---
you seem upset
---
Very intersting, it seem the null and umbrella have a correllation. 
---
But for empire i disagree . Beacause a lot of empuire ressource come from other part of space.
---
who would have thought, just like always Goons Were Right
---
There was a dude who took newbs into lowsec. Him and his friends made them mine, mission, and run combat sites. He tricked them into making the station their home and some never figured out how to fix that. Everytime one of them tried to leave they would kill them and pretty much tell them to get back to work. 
---
Eve slavery at it's finest.
---
I've made isk in some ways that I think are probably fairly unique. 
---

Most of the money I have in the game came from ransoms in lowsec and collecting loot from dead ships in nullsec. I have otherwise just been as opportunistic as possible and as efficient as I can be in order to remain solvent. I have far less money than most characters as old as mine, but I bet I had more fun getting it than the sad fucks shooting boxes in their carrier or sucking rocks in their rorquals.
---
Who are you talking about? Goons definitely did not. Horde and Co. got the green light from Gobbins to drop whatever.
---
&gt; ambiguous
---
Uhh ... ambivalent.
---
but so is the extractor price.  it is a rough estimate anyway, but should be around that amount depending on if you remap, use +5's etc.
---
**What am I seeing here?**
---
Mining and ratting kill values from zkillboard divided by regional mining and bounty incomes. The question at stake is what percentage of income do people lose in the form of ships directly lost. Ratting losses data includes Ishtars, VNIs, Gilas, Rattlesnakes, Marauders, and Supercarriers and Carriers fit in a certain way (that indicates a ratter ship). Mining losses data is more dependable because mining ships are discernible by type. Umbrella regions include Delve, Esoteria, Fountain, Branch, Vale, Tribute, Tenal.
---

Overall, the graph shows that the game has become safer overtime
---
Why don‚Äôt you grow one and support Eve for a month of blackout instead of just playing reddit pvp?
---
lol i love you as well ;)
---
They sound great to me
---
Underrated comment
---
"Null" includes "umbrella" and umbrella is where most of the gains/losses happen so it's normal that they correlate.
---
Here gons hat gons
---
uhh no they won't, one of the defining characteristics of bots is that they never sleep and never get tired.
---
reported for botting enjoy your ban
---
Training question, if I did the 3 months of MCT, except for maxing my alts PI, and industry skills, what‚Äôs the point?
---
I will not be able to get enough SP on the alts to extract at the end, and I really only want to fly my two mains, the alts alts only undock once a week to collect PI.
---
What else can I do with 3 months of training on 4 alts?
---
Sensor booster for capital, Boson, HAW and FAXes destroy what I heard and inspired to come to EVE: the fleet made from small ships can defeat a supercapital if we have right tactics and good teamworks.
---
So they give us structures to reenable local. Great. Who can afford to defend such structures? Large null alliances. Who is responsible for the district lack of content? Large null alliances.
---
The small groups that can't afford to defend structures like that are the ones who had content even before local was removed, so where's the benefit there?
---
Can you post one with "null without umbrella" ? I was thinking it was you're null line.
---
I played eve for years. Then the game was "unfairly changed" to a risk averse pve empire building theme park.  I used to be the type of player the game appealed to..not pussies who cry for asset safety and live under umbrellas in skill injected accounts.
---
I called it at the time...skill injectors and alphas would ruin eve. And there is no going back from that (at least skill injectors)
---
&gt; I want to feel like my 14 years playing this game wasn't a wasted investment
---
Eve Online:  time, well ... wasted.
---
Do it! Otherwise you don't have a hair on your ass!
---
While I can try and see why this would enrage you, the how you quote it " in-your-face screw-your-playstyle-and-the-horse-it-rode-in-on, just-go-away-scrub-and-good-ridda" is what has happend to most smallgang and to an extend larger scale PvP Playstyles. 
---
Blackops is pretty much dead outside of a couple specific cases, the hunters of old whos youtube videos inspired many to do the same mostly quit the game since the release of Citadels.
---
Battleships, especially brawling, are not to be seen anymore or more as a meme. And instead the "kiting" meta evolved which many carebears describe as cowerdly, though is the only way you can stay alive in a smaller gang (Triglavian shacked this a bit up, and thankefully broke the 100mn meta which i think most people hated)
---
Even just casually roaming has become harder, and harder and harder. Carebears over the last few years have been given countless buffs to their security, to a point where hunters need to rely on the target being afk, really stupid or extremly extremly unlucky. 
---
While blackout wont fix any of the problems, it is the first time a change has actully been made in favor of pvp, rather then afk or semi afk pve. (disregarding trigs which are kind of part of this but aimed at a diffrent problem)
---
Wrong. Quite the opposite. Extractor price will increase due to higher demand. Also the SP farming estimate is already assuming max training speed.
---
Maybe regular local only in npc null?
---
Nah hes in KF.
---
 when they made rorqs insanely hard to kill and able to ‚Äúinvincible ‚Äú a mining fleet it felt like they were favoring one side
---
I'll grant you a deployed Rorqual is difficult to kill (although it's recently been nerfed) but not counting the PANIC button it's a similar mechanic to how a dread works.  Stick it in place for 5 minutes but it gets a rep bonus.  Not earth shattering, IMO.  Being able to protect an unlimited number of accompanying ships is a little OP but I have only rarely seen that used to do anything but delay the inevitable.  There seems to be a lot of tears about Rorquals, but looking at it from the other side, without spending isk for injectors it takes literally years to skill into one and it's the top level ship for industrial pilots.  They are more expensive to build and fit than your average carrier or dread, and with the excavators (before the nerf crashed the value) on board they could easily approach 50% of the value of a super.  Do you think it would have been fair to make such a ship overly vulnerable to a 10 man nano cruiser gang?  When I see these complaints all I can hear is "we wanted easy kills but we got fights instead".  Please show me in the TOS where you are guaranteed a certain number of kills and certain type of encounter within a certain number of jumps on every login.  Go on, I'll wait.
---
 When they boosted nul-sec anoms it felt like they were favoring one side. 
---
When was this?  Was this before or after they nerfed the spawns of faction ships and 10/10 drops in the top level sites?  It hasn't been all one way mate, although it seems you've conveniently forgotten anything that doesn't fit your narrative.
---
 When they nerfed t3c align time it felt like they were favoring one side. 
---
So changing a cloaked and nullified cyno hunter from 3 seconds and change align time to closer to 5 so that an interceptor might possibly have time to fly out and decloak it before it can warp was an unfair change?  T3c were stifling the meta all the way around and were way overdue for a little bit of pullback.  I thought the changes CCP made there and to HACs were spot on.  I've always thought that CCP has generally been brilliant at balancing subcap hulls, especially considering all the different ways they can be fit and used.  
---
 When they re-did the moon mining mechanics, it felt like they were favoring one side. 
---
How did this favor a "side" unless you are talking about putting isk directly in the hands of players instead of passive income streams directly to the heads of the most powerful null blocks?  And passive moon mining was super, duper, ultra safe.  Now there are actual mining ships out there on a fairly easy to predict schedule, creating potential for content.  How was this a bad thing?
---
 When they made skill injectors a thing, it felt like they were favoring one side. 
---
Again, what side were you referring to?  If it was veteran players vs newer players, then yeah, but skill injectors benefit any analysis of PvE vs PvP equally.  I don't understand how this can even belong on a list of complaints about things CCP has done that benefited one style of play over another. 
---
And multiboxing supers?  That's *crazy*.  It's not even all that efficient, because you start losing fighters and the isk for each hull drops considerably.  And that's just with two.  There's no way without cheating to do three, and I'd say anybody that does two for very long is probably using a script.  Cheating should not be used as a basis for game balance, it should be killed with fire.
---
Some things we can agree on:
---
Smart bombing anoms is bullsh\*t.  PvE gameplay should be more engaging and less predictable, so that these types of shortcuts just don't work.  This isn't new though, it's been around since the rock Havens first appeared, circa 2009.
---
Rorquals are too easy to use.  Just sit and run for hours with minimal attention and occasionally compress the ore or change targets?  Nope.  Excavators should work like fighters and need constant micro to work.  Panic button shouldn't cover the entire fleet, only the ship that's deployed. 
---
AFK ratting ships should not be possible.  Remove the aggressive drone option for any ship with a drone damage bonus, make droneboats lock up targets and direct traffic just like a turret or missile ship. 
---
And null shouldn't be safe enough that you literally don't have to pay attention, although I would argue it's really not *that* safe.  I see the semi AFK guys get caught in their VNIs or T1 mining barges all the time while they are playing in the background while at work or doing other things on their computer.   It's just the ships are disposable.  The risk/reward balance is certainly off there, but part of that is making all gameplay more engaging and less able to be done with minimal input.  Null probably needs to be more dangerous, but please bear in mind I didn't suggest that local should not be turned off, just that the way it has been done without blacking out the other information systems is *unfair.*
---
Looks like you need some new friends.
---
implying you have the braincells to construct a sonnet
---
Ahahah, good one.
---
Im trying to look At this in bigger scale, and bots getting Rich while your averge joe gets a lot poorer doesnt sound good for the game.

(opinion of a person Who doesnt krab)
---
Speak for yourself, nerd
---
But Olmeca, the undock button was clearly hidden behind local. With local no longer obscuring that button, all our problems are solved.
---
Don't need data to tell me that. 
---
Insert resub meme here.
---
You've successfully called my bluff. I know it's a poem or something. I just wanted to sound smarter than I am :(
---
I'm away on vacation in a week for three weeks. I think I'll look for a corp when I get back.. Don't want to be afk right when I join
---
yep, no more magic money splooge.
---
baby steps, baby steps.
---
Goons are just home from war. Welcome to normal Delve, lol.
---
Hopefully CCP keeps quiet and keeps this up for a while at least, to get some good ideas.
---
Ya'll are crazy keeping the full window exposed. I used to keep Local all the way on the right, then cover the chat portion with my overview.
---
Why would bots stop logging in when this is just a minor inconvenience for them?
---
Why not? You don't think Amazon keeps track of how much money it makes?
---
or i can search "Asset safety"
---
Why do I need to do this?
---
you dont need to subcap rat in nullsec for money though ?
---
Because asset safety containers just shows the containers, not the contents
---
They all did, whether directly or indirectly through isk. That pvp players cant get this fact through their peanut sized brains baffles me. A production player who undocks who uses 500 plex a month is the same as a small gang elite pvper who uses 500 plex a month. Both help CCP's bottom like to the exact same rate.
---
Therefore if removing local causes pvp to go up 10% but 10-20% less people to play the game, then removing local is bad for the game as a whole.
---
So, what's different now exactle?
---
Yeah, this is more just a spectacular representation of the problems that existed before.
---
While in active wars with a bunch of other alliances?  You're joking right?
---
I mean, why search "Misc"? Other things are in the Miscellaneous group
---
How is this being derived?
---
Nah, just 900k SP.
---
Stop being the prey and become the predator, simple.
---
A good chunk of us don't use zkill for intel. We use it so we can easily laugh at the fits we see.
---
The Umbrella line actually finishes higher than it started on the right side chart.
---
But you know, there are hundreds if not thousands of bots in null, because when a hostile enters the system they warp out of their anomoly and get safe.  Not at all what a real human would do, real humans just sit and wait for the cyno to go up and die in a ball of fire.
---
You are not alone. I agree with you so much.
---
There are many of us.
---
Two questions:
---
1) How do I report a bot? There's no right-click menu item that I can see.
---
2) Is there a way to pay off a bounty on my toon so he doesn't have one anymore?
---
Thanks!
---
Can't do anything to make the hunters have trouble finding content, except removing local, but they got fooled into thinking it was a good idea. It's been quite funny actually.
---
We could speack of reduction of content if you give us for null outside umbrella. 
---
And if you count the defensive ship loose. 
---
Said " no enought loss" don't proof lack of content.
---
A lot of goons are assholes on reddit and say stupid and dumb shit and seem to get off on pissing people off.
---
Oh man looks like goon citizen #4384324b is feeling relevant today.
---
When I've counted the good posts you have made,
---
I don't even have to take my socks off.
---
I said on day one when this was announced that all it would do would be push all the null sec pilots that don't want to get farmed continuously under those very capital fleet umbrellas that everybody says is killing the game. At first I honestly thought CCP was running a stealth troll by showing how making this change would only make things worse.  Once I started seeing some of the dev posts going around I realized they were absolutely serious.
---
Breaking news: roaming to delve gets you bosoned.
---
Stay tuned for our planned programming at 11 - Skill injectors and rorquals?  Could this lead to an uptick in mining?
---
:place holder until I‚Äôm back at my computer to properly respond:
---
Well when unchecked player activity continues for a long period of time... 
---
Not saying something should be done about existing issues, but if you've got data that shows, say massive amounts of mining happening, and instead of addressing the source of that activity (the rocks/respawn rate itself) you try and apply little patches to resolve issues... You get the mess we are in.
---
No this is a bad idea. Bots can dock up just on local number increasing.
---
Thank goodness, don't let the door hit you on the way out!
---
Isn‚Äôt it ultimately required for someone to do it for BPC that only come from LP stores?
---
or sechs
---
And they did this even though NS themselves were saying dont.
---
Ots was last seen being dragged into the outback by a pack of Dingos
---
" I know, I know, good riddance and all of that....but when your game is attracting fewer paying customers than it has in over 10 years how many of your player base can you afford to run off before there's no game anymore for anybody to play? "   
---
That's a really good question.
---
You have already made it clear that you dont want arguments, your rhetoric is screaming of it. There is no point in discussing it with you.
---
Tracking computers on carriers effect fighters, it makes it easier for supers to hit frigate/destroyer rats
---
Post your main
---
&gt;Just looking at concurrent players, ESPECIALLY in the first few days is a very poor metric though.
---
But as time has moved on the numbers have gotten worse. We have seen a continued downward trend says day one, its not like there was a dip and then it stopped, each day there is less to work with then the day before.
---
This. So much of this.
---
I tried to hunt in null, found some shit on d-scan, never found it again. Then did a lot of jumps, got memed two times in two different gatecamps.
---
And in the end of the last trip, without finding anything, i got memed again in another gatecamp in lowsec border to null.
---
This was my experience.
---
Maybe you're collateral damage like everyone else is on occasion
---
in other words, change your gameplay to completely different or join a megablock?
---
Recently, actually paying for the sub on my skill farm was the only way I had it active. PLEX was way too high for me to risk the small margin I MIGHT get from trying to play that market.
---
There's no point i having it logged in there is no one to camp they all logged off too.
---
Doing this tells the person being invited that you're checking if they're online. Watch list and convo were removed because both worked without informing the mark.
---
Not botting
---
It still shouldn‚Äôt be in the game.
---
If it wasn‚Äôt for asset safety I‚Äôd never have started playing again, tbh. 90% of the reason I didn‚Äôt resub sooner is because I didn‚Äôt want to fuck around with assets in areas of space that were held by different people after 4 years had passed. Finding out about asset safety was a big factor in deciding to play again.
---
I might want to take another break at some point. The last thing I want to deal with or worry about when I‚Äôm starting to get burned out on a game is dealing with moving things for 2 weeks just in case I want to play again. It‚Äôs like a double whammy of fuck this.
---
&gt;I‚Äôm pretty sure CCP would rather have a couple dozen players paying a small amount compared to one player with the same number of accounts subscribed. 
---
They want money, they don't care who pays them, if they get 2 dozen people to bring back one account each and 4 people quit who are each running 12 they are still losing 24 accounts worth of PAYING people per month. In the business world money talks everything else takes a backseat to money.
---
Falcon came to Canada and adopted Bud. Its glorious!.  
---
Thanks for shaking things up bud!
---
Yeah I'd agree with you there. I still think the distonction is important.
---
But I'm unsubbed so who cares what I think
---
No. Communication. Whatsoever.
---
Except for CCP Falcon's Reddit post where doubles down as he discusses "wish I could do lowsec too" and happy to "go back to the old days".  Which he has since deleted.
---
Etherium Reach is where we don‚Äôt hotdrop now. TKE is free reign for anyone with a cap
---
CCP cares about the next 15 minutes, they have a nice long documented history of not seeing past the the end of the week.
---
LMAO
---
Either this 400IQ bait or he should go back to highsec
---
oh hey dude I remember that name.. yea I haven't played much in a long time I never got over the BC nerf  TBH.. when low sec turned into Frigs online I kinda got lost..  I've played off and on but man I just can't get into flying frigs/dessie so I never end up sticking around long 8(
---
Bro I've made billions hacking during the blackout.
---
Kill right farming.  Made an alt that was a pretty girl named Bambi and had her take long trips around LS in a velator.  Then I sold the kill rights.  Made about 500M before getting tired of it.
---
Its ok, I resubbed close to 300 scout alts to blanket over your space anyway.
---
Atleast we are relevant.
---
Regional kill values mined from zkill. Regional incomes come from MERs.
---
I can second this simply by observing Esoteria space. Systems which used to have 30 guys logged in ( 1-2 guys with 10 windows each) are now down to...
---
You guessed it - 2 guys. Still crabbing but now with super + FAX. Multi boxing Rorquals is more or less over and the ‚Äúindustrial‚Äù crew is on strike :). 
---
We see significantly depressed numbers for Entosis response and anything PvP related, however the number of gate camps, WH people and low sec visitors has skyrocketed.  Most of those 3-6 month old characters who got talked into joining 0.0 alliance should be back to where they are progression and skill wise: empire, lowsec and Provi. 
---
Long live the Blackout.
---
thanks for the write up from WW pov.   
---
I'd managed to drink through my hangover ;)
---
Another legendary moment in eve online how it shows you just never really know how things will play out in the end and how fast things will escalate o7
---
i begin with a 1v3 which escalates into another squad coming and then the Minmitar militia after them.
---
i pull range from the beacon inside the Plex and try to force the two parties to fight while i third party in the end   
---
if you are new to the game remember never to panic and just keep thinking over and over and in every situation there is always hope at-least this is my Eve Online Belief as a SOLO Player.  
---
i Thank all of you for the love and support time and time again Truly means alot
---
 See you all in the next one !
---
Okay buddy.
---
Not as big a mistake as small pos
---
Are they maxed on PI skills?
---
Get them into a scanner.
---
Get them into a DST.
---
Have them trained ceptor and cyno
---
There hasn't even been a week.
---
Like...that's not a statistically significant amount of time.
---
It takes time for big shakeups to settle. Both on the hunting and the krabbing.
---
Really, with all the hype for hunting, it would.be retarded to krab this weekend, even if the changes in the long run wouldn't dramatically affect the safety.
---
If that was true, I'd wager they wouldn't have done the blackout.
---
Because in the 15 minute range, it's a stupid fucking decision no matter what. It's only long term that such a gamble could pay off.
---
I didn't realize this post was political, it's been downvoted so much you'd think people were trying to rewrite the truth or something.
---
Interesting.
---
Thank you
---
I dont think he does either
---
Hard disagree. They're just no longer hilariously fucked.
---
The imperium is relevant.  As a member of the largest entity in the game, you personally however, could not be more inconsequential.
---
As a person who primarily does pvp hunting, I'd be totally cool with blacking out all that intel as well.
---
Delete this!
---
No one has seen the drifters, so I don't know what rats you're referring to.
---
That was one of my complaints, if blackout is caused by drifters, where are they?
---
Til that hitting d-scan on occasion and talking with your buds is the equivalent of having to constantly scan down chains and roll holes. Every. Fucking. Day. With no asset safety, no capital umbrella to save your dumb ass, and no convenient respawn mechanic.
---
That which is dead may never die
---
True. Ratting chart is less dependable (e.g. it would count some sov warfare super killmails) so I take mining a bit more seriously. Also there has been a 6t reduction in umbrella ratting between Jan and March (5t coming from Delve, Querious and Fountain) and no reduction in lossmails (coincidentally these are the same times DPCI began to be active in those regions).
---
Krabs.
---
um hi its 2019? and we were not expecting armchair data scientists for another 18 months. 
---
time to fire the data scientist
---
Did every single one of those Abaddons have abyssal gyro's on them? Must be cheap?
---
Then you managed to piss off a lot of people and probably deserve your 500-(wo)man gangbang
---
Empire conversion rate took a dive at the same time as null.  
---
Interesting.  
---
Maybe it's not the umbrella at blame after all?
---
I think it would probably have been even more warmly received then - because it's those people that have gotten comfortable in their super umbrellas that seem to be most upset at this change from what I've seen.
---
&gt;like some sort of sandbox game
---
lmao
---
a way to scew the event statistics. Unfortunately, we'll lose a lot of people but EVE survived much worse (Fozzie SOV)...
---
That was the first ting that came to my mind a week ago...
---
Hoping you'll have quit by then ...King Meow Meow
---
 Goons deployed to Pure Blind, PanFam started raking in kills in Delve so goons found it very difficult to krab. FTFY
---
Blackout is the most powerful tool that NGSA has
---
I haven't played since 2012ish but I would consider coming back if it wasn't so boring. MAKE LOW SEC WITHOUT LOCAL!!!
---
Nooo you see hes done so much for them he's had a massive impact with all that ore and f1.
---
Good, now get out of the sub while you're at it.
---
&gt; and I won't pay to be someone else's content
---
  welcome to every PvP based MMO since forever...
---
Maybe the drop in login was due to ratting bots breaking as a result of local? That's a good thing.
---
To put the skills into perspective, I have a brand new apt that does 200 dps t1 for.  My main in t2 modules get 600 dps.  Skills are everything.  https://secure.eveonline.com/dlc/
---
There‚Äôs one that five dollars for a million skill points.  Get that and get your guns and ship skills
---
Up
---
If a ship is fit exclusively to run away, why do you think you are entitled to kill them with a sub-standard fit?
---
You need to have a specialized fitting to gank the people who fit specifically against you.
---
Dont forget the free 1mil SP for logging in over the next week,  and double SP weekend two weeks after that
---
I didn't forget it at all? What's your comment got to do with my super awesome idea to fix lowsex #133742069?
---
someone with 12 accounts isn't paying, they're plexing. That's the big reason concurrent playercount in Eve is meaningless; only concurrent paid-Omega matters, and only CCP knows that number.
---
Woohoo!
---
Literally THATS THE JOKE.JPG
---
I'd rather less krabs to hunt- but with a realist chance at catching them
---
Already beat you too it, it's exactly what they havr announced
---
We don't need to dock up the big toys,  some small gang of bombers is not going to affect it
---
i guess you're the expert
---
Lets face it whats really ruining the game and causing inflation is skill injectors. There was a reason stuff was timegated in the past, but now you can get an account first day, drop a few hundred dollars and boom your able to fly a titan with absolutely zero knowledge of what makes a good fleet member, corp member, much less titan pilot. That being said, ain't no way in hell they will nix that because they are rolling in money off of it.
---
They've been amplified in the official CCP forums as well, because people are flagging anti-blackout posts as obscene, etc... Which gets them pulled...   Complete B.S.
---
See? Even more reason this is bullshit.
---
You literally can still do this.. No local has not changed their gameplay in the slightest
---
someone with 47 accounts is **not paying money**. I don't understand how people don't get that people plexing adds no value to CCP.
---
This is one of the points I've been trying to make.
---
I think this is a wonderful idea.
---
I'd like to see what the lore nerds could do.
---
This. It just introduces far more work into the most work-infused MMO on the planet. I still like EVE, but the only fun I've been having is chasing people down in the standing fleet lately...I'm not enjoying pretty much every aspect of the game I normally play.
---
No matter how you break it down, the vast majority of people are null players, and a good portion of those people aren't happy with the changes. "Shake things up", sure, but you still have to care about what your playerbase wants and is willing to pay for.
---
People who post ideas here in most case don't think them though very thoroughly. And I now I suspect they are simply getting ideas from here, don't think them through, and then they put them in live server.
---
If they want to address these issues they would have to change the reward/risk/availability side of things. 
---
People become much more concerned not because they want to, but because it's much more efficient than spreading out. Holding lots of sov often brings little gains, but it's a pain to maintain. Small densly populated regions are much better at it.
---
&gt; The problem is that i will never now which of those alts are my exit route because, well, could be a 50+ gang on that system and i have no idea.
---
what, just bounce and check dscan mate, unless you really think there is a 50 man fleet on standby in either cloaky shit, dscan immune or in a deep safe waiting for your cyno, and if you think that there is i'm sorry to say but your super isn't worth even close to how much you think it is.
---
&gt; I just dont want to lose this ship for a fleet of F1 monkeys with their dreads/super blob. Kill it by doing better stuff than i could do, not by just a bunch of F1 monkeys.
---
Repeating this same argument in many different posts doesn't either, I keep seeing that dude's rhetoric everywhere.
---
What would a goon know about that? Go punch old ladies at the bus stop.
---
/u/summer_vonsturm that is a stupid point of view. If I played an online game to play with my RL friends (which is 90% of the reason I play video games at all) and my friends quit playing...I will too. I'm playing to play with them, not the countless people I don't know. Telling him his friends walked away from him and it's only fear preventing him from enjoying the game is ridiculous.
---
I don't understand your point :-(
---
I'm not taking about PvE-ers. I'm talking about people generally who afk 'play' OR getting rid of as many bots as possible.
---
For downvoting my post I subbed 100 more
---
Don't worry. If you believe this sub, ship kills should spike up drastically for this month and the foreseeable future.
---
The blackout fixed everything.
---
1) https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000249125-Reporting-suspected-bot-users
---
2) Bounties mean basically nothing, you can just ignore it or go welp some ships to get rid of it.
---
You are seeing it all from one \*very\* specific point of view. I'm always in fleet with 100-200 people and a great majority aren't happy with the changes.
---
how about you shut the fuck up dreader? (or pay for my inevitable loss)
---
Hey, would you have a guide or contact on how I can get into Alpha incursions?
---
Yeah, and the 2017 july/august dip seems to coincide with our Hakonen deployment.
---
And if you cannot be bothered with it - Empire is for you. There is absolutely nothing wrong with sticking to empire space if you cannot handle blackout.
---
You t1 fit pirate ships and caps?
---
Why? Because a change came with no notice to a large swath of the playerbase who didnt opt-in to the wormhole style of play.  This is not a complicated thing regardless of how you feel about the game mechanic that existed for 16 years prior in 0.0 space.
---
Almost like we have been saying this from the start ü§î no local? Join a major bloc,  get in a rorq or super, fit a cyno and you're safe wow amazing content!
---
What about skill injectors?
---
Of that number you referenced how many logged in were bots that now could not run their scripts?
---
Got one for wormhole space?
---
only if you want to do fleet stuff.  if you want to do solo, joining a big newbro corp isn't that helpful.  you have to learn how to play pilot your ship and how to fight other ships.  you're not going to do that anchoring to an fc and shooting what they tell you to.
---
faction warfare is still the best thing for new players
---
Incorrect. Saying an activity strike against a change is "toxic" is exactly the same as politicians saying "people striking a change we're making are toxic". No, it's not toxic. It's the best way to show support for a side.
---
Their inaction is to make a point -- they're not happy with the change. I see why CCP did it and I support wanting to test out changes, but I'd disagree that it's a toxic minority. This type of change only benefits people in two situations: internally wealthy, and in a group that has strong support.
---
This type of change prevents people from playing this game in null solo or in small groups. It's not like WH space where a size limit will prevent that person/group from getting railroaded...small-time miners (and I'm including groups of 10 Rorqs) at this point have no defense against the super umbrellas that are all around null. Proliferation has made sure that super groups have endless resources now...so you can't just "undo it" by making things harder. It's not harder for the big 3 groups, it's harder for everyone else.
---
Despite reddit ree facts are not supporting the narrative it seems
---
I actually didn't up or down vote you any because I assume all my crab systems are now camped, but that's ok, I'm still not undocking my crabs until shit goes back to normal. Thanks for buying my plex, TTT and my market alts thank you.
---
Let me just key in on the major point it appears you're making here:
---
&gt; It makes people who live in null who's primary focus is PvE think that the devs have decided the game doesn't need or want them  
---
You want to talk about a particularly out of touch point of view, this is it. How massively entitled do you have to be to just conclude that because a developer attempts to reduce the effectiveness of uninteractive player tools like local intel scrapers that they've somehow "turned against you".  
---
You mention being able to see PvE levels on Dotlan. I'd love it if you couldn't see any of that information in space, and I'd love it even more if you more wormholes would spawn throughout Lowsec to allow players to be more interactive with Nullsec residents in a fun and content-oriented fashion.
---
Also, this isn't intended to make Nullsec like wormholes. In that regard you're also way off base. You shouldn't be able to control access to Nullsec in that way, it's precisely because of the unpredictability of wormholes that the ability to reduce mass on wormholes that the mechanic exists. You literally never know what system you're going to roll into. Nullsec routes are well established. Creating those mechanics would in essence turn remote Null into even more of a fortress than it already is by essentially no effort on the part of the people living there. That's an extremely poor change that once again, limits interaction between players.  
---
Personally I think it's absolutely amazing you have the audacity to quote concurrent player numbers when the game's been slipping deeper and deeper into the shitter for years by the very design you're tearfully advocating in your Blades of Grass tier post. You want to talk about objective numbers, read your own asinine words:
---
&gt;Opinions are like a-holes, everybody has one, but player participation is the only objective measurement that I know of, and the player participation numbers over the last couple of weeks stink and they are getting worse.
---
&gt;I know, I know, good riddance and all of that....but when your game is attracting fewer paying customers than it has in over 10 years how many of your player base can you afford to run off before there's no game anymore for anybody to play?
---
How do you think we got here? Blackout's been out like a week. Side note nobody cares what you've done in this game at any time. If you're not relevant now (with very few exceptions) then you were never relevant.
---
It does. Paying for a subscription CCP gets $13    If you pay for it with plex, CCP made $19 off the plex sell. CCP makes more money from plex than subscriptions.
---
I 'member this. Was a hell of a feelios ride reading that. 
---
Got a pretty wicked justice boner from it too. A beautiful piece of eve history
---
Blackout "gets rid of" real human players more than bots who can dscan non stop. You're full of shit.
---
It means more to me than you know friend. Keep it up.
---
It amazes me how many people that play eve are illiterate or don't do reading comprehension if there isn't a tldr. Pvp pilots are sticking around to kill any non Legacy targets, crabs are retired.
---
&gt; Wormholes which are basically safer than null
---
safer is not the same thing as perfectly safe. The only perfectly safe activity in eve that I know of is staying docked in an NPC station.
---
Less concurrent players or less alts?
---
What I've experienced logging less is afk ratters, which usually are second accounts and IMO a pest for gameplay.
---
It's impossible to calculate players subs by these raw data, only CCP has full statistics.
---
Blackout is popular, I love it, there will be time needed to adapt.
---
you are apparently not aware what plexing is. Plexing is not "buying plex with cash, then using the plex to buy gametime", plexing is using ISK to buy plex, and then using the plex to buy gametime. No cash is given to CCP when plexing.
---
Oh yeah I need to take away that stupid f1 monkey flare, my bad.
---
And under that logic, mmos would not exist at all in the first place, so it's just a matter of meeting some new friends in a new corp... the entitlement of  "The game is not the way I like, so I quit" is basically just mediocre thinking.   
---
Funny how people still refuse to adapt after centuries of evolution.
---
marco
---
why would anyone in the temporary-blackout area undock? Unless the blackout lasts several days, it's not like they can actually destroy their citadels or anything...
---
And that's what ruines EVE. Needing afk activity or alts. +1 for your idea.
---
That was garbage too.
---
Unless you sold Plex about 8 years ago I don't think I bought from you
---
Nah I can't catch the bots, at least I couldn't pre blackout
---
A bot put a bounty on me some time after I killed him. Having a bounty is a "state" so I figure he did that so that I would register on an avoid list? Or am I overthinking it?
---
Lol you might have then.
---
damn dude u died in nullsec thats crazy how could this happen how u supposed to get ur moneys??
---
I'd rather the game die in a tama thunderdome then the day the last bot VNI logs off.
---
how does ur gameplay change exactly?
---
U stop being shit at the game and can kill some fucking bombers?
---
damn brother dont get crazy with ur ideas now
---
No. With local one still has a chance to warp out and switch to pvp ships to take the fight. 
---
Without local you'd be an idiot to still rat without an umbrella. 
---
Nice try muddying the water though. "It was the same in the past anyways..." Get fucked.
---
Currious if you could convert this graph into isk values of ships
---
have yall given some more thought to delaying DB where Zkill and others pull from? To further the blackout, but to not have Squizz undercut if he were to do it on his own?
---
&gt;Space already feels emptier, and may yet become even more empty, but when encounters happen, at least for me so far, they have been far more meaningful and memorable‚Ä¶ because they‚Äôre not flown by fucking scripts
---
This is probably the most important unintended consequence of the changes. You have people running tall right now under concentrated regional umbrellas but what an immense power vacuum it's created on the outskirts in terms of day to day activity (because sov is legitimately worthless, still).
---
At least an important intermediate point before further iterations take place. Hopefully in order to increase sprawl due to scarcity.
---
Man, what you are stating right here is one of the absolutely biggest arguments against no local and any structures or bla bla to imitate it. This will 100% hurt the smaller groups and in turn the same people screaming for more content.
---
Which does nothing for literally 90% of the people that gank...there is literally no defense and no preparation for these. The right one can drop in a fleet on you before you even see a thing on DScan, no matter how quickly you're refreshing it.
---
I don't disagree that something needs to change, but with Local the way it is there's literally no defense against multiple ship types and multiple ship fits. Not everyone can be bait or have a big corp willing to bankroll when they lose their ships all the time.
---
There are a huge number of people that play this game to relax and do background stuff (krabbing, ratting, mining, PI, etc...) and this change screws over their entire playstyle. How \*you\* feel about that is irrelevant...how they do is all that matters. If those people aren't willing to keep paying CCP to do it then the change was bad.
---
Huh?
---
Looks like your mom should have swallowed.
---
Blackout effects human players more than bots who can spam dscan nonstop. 
---
oh no, someone who's brain dead is spewing speculated bs again.
---
My bad, you're complaining to get something fixed that doesn't affect you.  got it.
---
So your point is that eve online is just a massive fluke and the ONLY reason it exists today is you,the player's, valiant effort against CCP s incompetence? Daamn man. I hear mittens might be recruiting another narrative spinner.
---
bad change, nullsec should be more dangerous than lowsec
---
if u wanna make lowsec more dangerous, remove gate guns and make station guns stronger and do all that cool fw shit people have been suggesting for ages
---
and bring back plex sliding fuck u loki campers
---
And then everyone clapped.
---
Admittedly I was one of the biggest advocates against it. But, the more I thought about it and actually took advantage of it. I fell in love with it. I mean, really diving into what null sec really is it completely makes sense. But I do think it should be citadel content in order to bring back the local to as what we know now
---
People haven't adapted at all, still hateful and stupid as always. What adaptation are you talking about? Any new features? Scales? Gills?
---
What's this adaptation you speak of?
---
Yes
---
This coming from the alliance that flat gave up?
---
That PLEX didn‚Äôt appear out of nothing though. Someone had to purchase that PLEX from CCP to begin with, and then it was sold on the market by the original purchaser. It doesn‚Äôt matter that you bought it with ISK; PLEX is the digital representation of cash that was paid to CCP at some point, and when you use PLEX for game time you‚Äôre taking that digital ‚Äútoken‚Äù out of circulation.
---
I think it's a bit weird that the fastest or otherwise evasive ships, those which can most easily get out of bubbles, are also the one's which are usually nullified.
---
If your the kind of jackass I get to look forward to, I'll pass, no one needs friends like you.
---
So being active isnt really a counter you say? Because no matter how active you are, how skilled you are, how much knowledge you have, how much isk you spend, you cant see what isnt possible to see. I.e, cloaky and d-scan immune ships. You can covert cyno in all of Eve without anyone knowing.
---
The issue therefore isnt a blackout, the issue is that we cant counter the risk. Because people will sure as shit go for cloak and d-scan immunity, why prices on curse hit 1b.
---
So no worries, keep the blackout. Remove cloaks and d-scan immunity to outweigh the risk. No worries for the small gang right? They just want gfs against gatecamps and they dont really care about killing VNIs and such.
---
But I bet you 150% that no one will go for that. Because they want aaaaaaaall the advantages.
---
this is like the 6th goon to post this on reddit today, are yall actually trying to make this a meme
---
better idea, unfuck local. Delete supercapitals. this way you actually take the edge off of nullblocs without making everyone but gankers and null blocs stronger.
---
I just use /r/eve and it gives me stuff to read.
---
One of the most concise explanation I've seen.
---
That's a huge assumption, at one point I ran 6 accounts, Paid for all of them with a credit card because I didn't want grind isk to turn into a job, currently I'm down to 2. it takes 6 people with 1 account joining to make up for a player my size leaving.
---
Who says? You? The sheeple like you?   The game in 2007 said it was about exploration and conquest, and gaining power. The video is still up on Eve online's YouTube channel if you need proof
---
You are a daft. No matter when or who pays for the plex, CCP still got $6 more than just subbing for a month. Plex is like beer tickets. When I buy a beer ticket today, It is worth one beer. I go to redeem that beer ticket a year later, it is still worth one beer. Did the bar loose money? No, I paid for it a year ago. That is how Plex works. You buy it now for a premium so it can be redeemed when ever it is convenient. CCP already made the money off the Plex and has calculated that into the finances. You use the Plex to buy a skin instead? You just gave the bartender your beer ticket for an empty glass and did it gleefully.
---
lol
---
&gt;it's a stupid fucking decision no matter what
---
Have you kept track of how many times CCP made a decision that could be described as "fucking stupid"?
---
please no, this would be worse than cancer
---
Most of the market/logistics types would welcome anything that created more volatility and movement of goods.
---
The important changes are the ones which make investments tangible.
---
Yeah no, you guys jsut keep wardeccing peope till they stop logging in and ruin EVE
---
I mean in reality did you like the current state of the game? You have to admit that there was just stagnation, and if nothing was done the game would spiral down and die. The game was super healthy around the Halloween war, when it was focused on PvP. A lot of people are just excited for changes that help focus on making other play styles viable.
---
Can we see these per region?
---
Yeah you're right. How many of the concurrent players pre blackout were bots though? It could be that the number of real players that were actually playing the game was higher than it has been. Seems impossible to tell really. I think I'll choose to remain optimistic though, the subreddit has actually been like 80% positive for the past week, pretty insane really.
---
jesus you're so pathetic
---
can't you stop political posting for one minute and enjoy reddit
---
The only thing the bounty will do for him is let him know when someone kills you.
---
oh no
---
Like it or not krabs pay the bills, even if they are plexing. They also give people targets to hunt.
---
If the krabs are winning Eve then it's just downwards cycle from here as the PvPers get bored and stop logging in as well.
---

The law, in its majestic equality, forbids the rich as well as the poor to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal bread.
---
How can a ratter use the NPC/24 map to make themselves safer? Going to rat in a less common system is going to spike the NPC killed stat for that system, which hunters can use to see that someone is ratting there if you have a "habit" (ex, come home from work, eat dinner, and mayber play eve for a couple hours before bed). Dotland makes that patter quite easy to figure out.
---
Why did you waste everyones times posting this
---
I cant even play right now and just subbed hoping it stays like that when i come back months later
---
Like im not even playing the game im paying for.
---
So though anecdotal, very popular??
---
Put pirate NPC station/citadels in lowsec and use the diamond npc logic subroutines.
---
I wonder if its more of an attempt to get people who are not logging in because of blackout, to log in and potentially give it a shot. I remember when it started, I was just shit scared and didn't want to undock, didn't want to risk anything and just jump cloned to low sec and did FW. 
---
But when I actually went to the effort of getting out there in NS, I had an absolute blast. People were actually fighting! Fleets went from toasters and feroxes to all this small gang space pirate shit and I love it.
---
By the way you type, I'm not sure you'd understand my post even if I explained it.
---
Yeah too true. If this gets people playing the game I'm all for it. I'm sure that if they're putting out this kind of promotion, then there is surely no way they're going to be using logins as a metric for player satisfaction. That's way too transparent
---
One alliance owed me some isk they destroyed a POS and other infrastructure while I was gone and we had a NIP. I cloaky camped them for a couple months, they paid the bill with interest, fed me caps, and also were relegated to repairing POS mods.
---
If it stops all activity until you leave, can't you fuck a whole system of bots by cloaking up and sitting there?
---
Or structures that preserve npc nullsec local and not player local since those are all the official nullsec factions. We literally can't predict and CCP refuses to say anything unless specifically attacked.
---
Yeah no game will ever have deflation, and devs are know to intervene to prevent deflation.
---
Deflation means existing isk is worth more by just sitting there, which causes the economy to go whack and entrenches the advantage of older players.
---
For what reason?
---
Cap blobs is a human nature issue not CCP. No matter how you want to change the mechanics, people want to form communities and pay for the server. Every time CCP does something to ‚Äúequalize‚Äù the game, they only hurt smaller groups.
---
No where did it say null sec was supposed to be dangerous, or that it was a PVP only game, stop trying to push that rhetoric.
---
My man, Ive done all of that. And do you want my honest opinion as a nullseccer? Shit is a lot easier in HS. I usually burn out in NS cause its a lot of shit that goes on. Granted, I take on too much at times but still.
---
NS is boring most of the time, its barely any content. Roaming is hard cause we have to roam to other NS areas, people keep forgetting that we probably stand for the absolute majority of PvP in Eve, but ours isnt respected since we are just f1 monkeys and not elite. Its PAPs, regulations this and that.
---
The only really good thing about NS was that you could sometimes do some mindnumbing PvE to relax but even then whilst being somewhat vigilant. The paranoia of missing something is always in the back of ones head. And its honestly rarely about the isk, its mostly about having something to do.
---
Also, I have never seen one of these magical game tools man. People keep knocking them but its players that report. And let me tell you something else that no one talks about, they only really work in Delve. I havent seen any other region that holds enough numbers to cover enough systems for total coverage. Not even close. People slip by the net more times a day than I can count, its just another myth that people that dont live in NS keep selling as truth.
---
So you understand, things in NS arent as people keep saying it is. Its a lot of BS, the reality is quite different and if you understand that you will get why people dont want local to disappear. Then the only activity that repaid all your other work and boredom disappears and with that your will to live in NS. And Im not alone in this thinking. So whos gonna live in null when a lot of average null players decide to leave?
---
You're wrong wrong. Here's why.
---
&gt;You can crit or roll most wormholes as a method of access control to a wormhole.
---
I keep hearing null sec saying this. It literally means absolutely nothing. Crit holes you can still pour ships through. If you get a scanner into a rolled hole it's easy AF to find a connection to that hole from somewhere else. It's a moot point. Every wormholer knows this. Stop trying to make this a thing. If you close one wormhole another one opens if it's a static. Every hole has a static. Therefore there is a WH open to your WH AT ALL TIMES NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO.
---
&gt;No cynos in wormholes. Do I really need to explain how a lack of knowledge of who is in system at any given time combined with cyno mechanics now makes null infinitely more dangerous than it was before? I really shouldn't have to, given all the "experts" in this Reddit.
---
It makes it more blobby maybe. But it also makes people less likely to try anything out of fear. So it basically gives you a Mexican stand off situation that is boring and shitty.
---
&gt;Local has gone but all of the tools used by hunters remain.
---
Are you really getting a game mechanic and story line confused? You sound like one of those dudes at a comic Con sitting in the front row asking if the key in dungeon 58 clearly plays a note wrong on the third frame.
---
Don't be that high level of an autist. No one is impressed.
---
&gt;A sense of fairness is ingrained into our behavior, and removing local without removing all the other statistics isn't fair. It makes people who live in null who's primary focus is PvE think that the devs have decided the game doesn't need or want them.
---
Fair and fairness. Fair and fairness. 
---
Ya no listen. You guys in null held all the fucking cards for years. You have no right at all to bitch and moan. You abused the system for so long that you feel entitled.
---
Well, shits done changed and yes. You as a null sec idiot that contributed to the giant mess that is eve are entirely responsible. So shut it. It's time for everyone else to have some fun.

Oh shit we‚Äôre both retarded
---
it was just a heated gaming moment
---
makes you thonk
---
Plexing just means someone else is paying, at a premium too. It's strange how some people in here are totally ignorant of how Plex works and just assume it is somehow free game time.
---
Imo JF, dread and carriers should be what is used in low sec, but remove SC and titans
---
Sounds stupid. Finally nullsec feels little bit dangerous.
---
How is jspace safer than a deadend null system? At least in jspace some cloakies could sneak up on you
---
I can ask you the same thing
---
You can still enjoy low-effort gameplay in hisec. It's not like you're forced to live in what supposed to be the most dangerous zone of space. Imo the real issue is eve bacame easy and risk free and blackout helps a lot here.
---

Feel free to admit you were wrong at any time.
---
Because he wants shiny kill mails he doesn't have to work for.
---
It‚Äôs the summer and most people actually go outside. On top of that, wormhole space will always have no local. So everyone trumpeting about how great it is graduated from Jita right into a huge null-bloc and has no clue what else this game has to offer. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs stagnant.
---
Supers die to subcaps all the time...
---
Reeeeee
---
Lol not a single Goon rorqual that was mining died during the blackout weekend, interesting.
---
Oh no, war. Not like there's highsec everywhere and wardeccers only concentrate in certain locations!
---
Free like the minerals one mines.
---
Coming from an alliance that died off and never got back on its feet and is treated like pets to the Russians?
---
you are the saltiest poster about blackout
---
Just unsub already
---
Man i managed to tackle one pre blackout but couldnt break him in my retri :(
---
That is the only way this is going to go and your suggestion is also imo the only way to go. We lack 2 things, 1: reason to fight, and 2: ways of making the fighting easier. The only way we are going to get a reason to fight is to straight up cut the number of people 1 system can hold. The more overfarmed a system gets the lesser bounties and mining clusters it gets (dunno exactly how one would do it, smarter heads can think of a way). This will force us to fight for space and it will force us to spread out. Supercap umbrellas will weaken and also peoples mindset. If you live far away from "home" for a period of time you might start to question your allegiance. "Why should I stick with these guys when things arent that great?". Maybe, just maybe people start leaving to join other smaller alliances because these changes hit big alliances harder.
---
Thats how you start to break megaalliances, not by forcing more to join them by removing the only real security they had.
---
Banning cynos would be interesting as it would make it harder for outside forces to just "drop in" to a fight, this would be specifically helpful in FW as I know it used to be common for bat phones to go out during fights..
---
On the flip side I do think JF's need to be able to jump in and out of low. I could only imagine the headaches not being about to JF into low sec for big null alliances. No need to give the logistic guys that headache..
---
Now as for titans, supers.. remove them.. make some sort of low sec cyno jammer for those.
---
Set up scouts around ratting systems, keep whs in the area rolled(use agency to check # of Sig's) use dscan constantly, every time it lets you click it type of shit. Dock your subcaps when your scouts see something or you catch something on dscan.
---
Yikes.
---
Is that what I needed this entosis module for?!
---
..........?
---
your complaining that goons killed you?
---
in geminate?
---
like...even when horde was based in gemi(they not anymore. its now open renter space),   it was always a hotbed for fighting as horde likes people visiting so they can feed the hordelings some content.
---
and even without htem based in gemi, they still use it as a content area.
---
so....how is this cancer?
---
It's a new EVE event, What could possibly go wrong????
---
You‚Äôre the cancer to this sub and bane of posting, destroyer of brain cells
---
barra
---
oof
---
I don't know what you are smoking. 
---
1. Use pings: goons typically set them up for you with convenient citadels perched off gates
---
2. Use a scout to see what on other side of gates

Stick with an Astero or go for a Helios!
---
Helios is by far the best T2 scanner to choose from - if you look at fitting space like cpu, powergrid etc. its the best of the bunch to fit for exploration and scanning/hacking. Another benefit is also its lower price compared to an Astero.
---
Stratios is more a cloaky hunter than a ship thats made for exploration! Stratios suck if you need to escape a gatecamp or need to get the fuck out of a relic site.
---
Look at this [Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/af7536/the_ultimate_nullsec_faction_relicdata_sites/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) and try to go for only Sansha or Guristas sites! Get into null.sec so you get them often and don't waste your time traveling through WH! You don't need a data analyzer btw, just look at the stats above.
---
If you really care about explo you want to get into a Helios *(with a fit much like* [*this*](https://i.imgur.com/7adrdmy.png)*)* because it should be the most easy way to get around!
---
&gt; someone with 12 accounts isn't paying, they're plexing
---
ccp still gets paid in this scenario i don't know why people think it's some holy counter-argument to pve multiboxers unsubbing
---
That is not my point, but now that you mention it: how many new games have they started and then abandoned mid-development? After all that time, money and hype has been wasted, do you seriously think they're all-wise?
---
Will for sure!
---
Some people conceive facts as "salt", which is a word you hear a lot from them. Strange isn't it? The only possible explanation would be delusion and/or mental retardation.
---
Are people using tactical overview and why?
---
Ooh, good tip! Bought it.
---
I feel like you guys are in some kind of identity crisis where you're not sure if you're supposed to be smug or salty.
---
It's just too damned bad that you don't get to fight us one at a time, huh?
---
Because it's deliberately misleading. He literally clipped it at the lowest edge before a downtime to make it look like that was a continuing trend. If you look at the actual graph, it's a dip much like the others shown at downtimes. 
---
Population is down a bit, but it's due to the "walkout" a portion of the playerbase is trying to orchestrate to protest the changes. If that amounts to only around 1k less players then they are the minority, contrary to the narrative they're trying to spin that only a vocal minority is pushing for these changes. 
---
They're trying to meta this and are doing a terrible job because the facts don't support their claims
---
Lol like wangspin could destroy W space while being tethered to a B274.
---
You dont seem to enjoy playing this videogame, so stop
---
Looks basically the same
---
No, I'm pretty sure we're supposed to be smug at all times. it's the difference between ruining our game and ruining the game.
---
I'll see that reeeeee, and raise you a REEEEEEEEE!
---
What a shit fit proteus lmao. Doesn‚Äôt even have hyper spatials
---
but does it dies by frigates only fleet?
---
99% of the supers rat under an umbrella anyways..
---
so, ill happily trade the chance of cathing one of the supers not under an umbella in change for more content or better chances to kill supers under an umbrella.
---
hey guys it's me ccp falcon here to pander on reddit for karma again
---
Care to elaborate ? I roamed for 4 hours lately during EU tz (early and normal), US tz (early), couldn't find ANYTHING not even a damn helios to shoot.  All empty structures with 0 guys inside nothing on d-scan. Finding someone random in a WH is like gatecamping some end nullsec pipe and expect to have fights.
---
I mean, that kind of looked like a lot of PvP and no local chat. The original vision
---
Where is the proof to back up the claims youve done everything? Why should anyone take what a week old account as to say seriously
---
&gt;I don't really expect anybody to shift their opinion one iota, but far down the road when I've reached the stage of acceptance (I'm currently at anger) and I can look back on my good memories of EVE with fondness, I will know that I at least tried.
---
you really shouldn't have
---
Why stop? I'm having too much fun fooling with clowns on r/eve. I think my above diagnosis is accurate!
---
bUt kRaBiNg Is mY pLaYsTyLe. PlEaSe ReSpEcT iT!
---
The vendetta that TNT lost today begs to differ. My group has been having a great time flying around delve is small shit. So much stuff to kill.
---
Can't write one phrase without inserting some shit language, can you ?
---
You fail to realise for Krabs; the ISK that comes from ratting is the carrot, not the act of ratting itself. 
---
Ratting without reward isn't going to work. You're turning PVE into "go do the ratting, or you get the stick." You're proposing that inaction against a PVE system ought to be a punishment. 
---
I'm all for Delayed Local, but your idea is pants-on-head retarded.
---
CCP_ROUND(); shenanigans i guess
---
ur just lazy to fite it
---
The real problem is people being risk averse and supers/titans. Not all people, but primarily the content creators. Take away isk efficiency...and what are people playing for? The answer should be fun. Good, wholesome brawls for pvp guys, and I dunno getting rich to do fuck knows what as an indy guy.
---
What you get currently is 90% of fc's wont fight unless it's 3:1 odds because their space pixels matter with a 10tril srp wallet. Or if you try to do anything you eat supers/titans which can't really be countered in the numbers that exist anymore. "But pitts why not use your titans against others titans" - because back to risk averse fc/leaders. No one wants to welp their titan fleet and then have no control over their region. 
---
You want to fix eve pvp you have to get people to just want to have fun.
---
What would do that in my opinion? Get rid of supers n titans hazing subcaps. If you do that though now the krabs don't feel safe and quit. Or you will face similar carrier/ dread issues. How can you fix that? Nerf faxes even more. (Did a cap training op on sisi... it only took 4x fax to save my titan from 30 dreads. Come on ccp... let shit die) then the cap pilots wont undock and krabs wont do shit because no cover and it spirals down. 
---
So tbh the game is probably too far gone. But blackout may have bought some more time. I'm subbed through the new year with more titans n dreads than I know what to do with. Will see at the end of that time. Maybe ccp nerfs supers/titans, keeps the nullsec blackout, and the Chinese stop botting... aaaaand maybe I just self destruct my shit on the undock
---
Bomber fleet.
---
Oh how I wish that change never came
---
He is literally telling you how people are changing behaviour as it happens and your response is, wait a few months? Sure glad youre not a doctor or no patient would survive.
---
Is this a plot with office? Seriously? If you bring this plot as an argument for the blackout it backfires as it shows rapidly declining NPC kills from the start of the year on.
---
For scaling if you scale the ship kills up than put them to the same level at the start.
---
All the more incentive to go take down that citadel.
---
Correction, what CCP wanted it to be.
---
ü§£
---
They didn't used to be able to. (Unless that's the joke)
---
You can essentially lock yourself in with your WH system, but you still have to pay attention to any new sigs popping up from someone rolling into your hole. Does not really compare to a dead-end null-sec system though, just that Jspacers can do something similar, with a lot more set-up work for every-time they do it generally.
---
Lol, thats a very random number pulled out of your ass. Any real evidence behind this?
---
i want my brain cells back!

But we never quit.

Is it possible to play EVE casually?  I am not allowed to use voicechat (or just chat in general) and cannot spend money on the game as I am young.  (13)  I like it so far as I have played through the epic arc and have found a good career, I am just worried it will be too hard to play.
---
You need some kind of use for a second character for this to matter. You could buy one on the character bazaar to achieve whatever benefits you want, and then either train or skillfarm that character.
---
Why don't you make me?
---
1) If you live in Imperium you should have the money to get onto at least a Carrier if not super
---
2) If you really cannot or would not get into a ratting capital, then why even rat, do other things like exploration, ded running or running abyssal sites. Those activities gave you more payoff than afk ratting in a vni and once you finished you don't have to worry about getting caught by bombers when watching Netflix
---
3) "But... but, I don't have the skillpoints to pilot a carrier or a decently fitted exploitation ship!" Worry not, there are multiple free skill point give-away by CCP this summer!
---
Yeah, devs usually have in mind to do lots of crazy stuff, luckily there is a top management who decides
---
&gt; Rorqs are not all that affected.
---
no local makes it substantially easier to bomb excavators
---
Im a miner in null sec and the black out has really inhibet my game play... But I FUCKING LOVE IT. I think it brings a more realism sense to the game. In the open frontier of space not knowing whats gonna run up on u uless u have a network of intel... Its beautiful i for one would sign for a perm black out of null. And low sec would make sence aswell. But thats my opinion.
---
And you have a superiority complex, and no language is shit. Language is language, a series of sounds we've decided mean something
---
The vision was cast as we do as we please, as long as we learn from the past.
---
Finally the game is genuinely dieing. Next part of this story will be lost in subscriptions and then profit. Data doesn't lie. Wait till the subs stop altogether not just with a trial that is underway.
---
I dont date guys man. Sorry. Better luck with the next person:)
---
So you have zero ground to stand on concerning discussion about any balance changes
---
They want more ships dead, and less ability to mine the ores.  Gets rid of a lot of PLEXed accounts.  Now people are more likely to spend usd on the game.
---
Places like EVE Uni and Pandemic Horde, Brave Newbies, Brand Newbros(In TEST) all don't really mind that too much so long as you have some activity. Those are all places I recommend since they've streamlined the learning process - you'll get a decent grasp on the game and then move up into bigger ships.
---
This was my personal favorite feed of his https://zkillboard.com/kill/77362785/
---
Those are exports.
---
I think they ignore them after a while. I mean the person who runs them prob puts them blue or something.
---
&gt;....that made it impossible to hunt anything.
---
only for stupid and lazy people it seemed impossible. Every day hundreds of destroyed ships in nulsec prooved otherwise.
---
sure bud
---
The ones leaving now are just (mostly) the bottlers and PvE players which made big isk by afk Ratting. They didn't bring any irl money on the table and subscribed with plex every month. Losing those players is big irl money for CCP as the PvE has been greatly reduced and more people will buy game time again instead of plexing with PvE isk.
---
It's all about the money.
---
Lol you have a suuuuper hard on for me it seems. Dude, get a gf, bf, bff, whatever. Drink a glass of whiskey, smoke something, go out and get some fresh air. Live brother, live.
---
You act like people who're on r/eve aren't here to waste time
---
Apparently they can, did, and could do so indefinitely
---
There was a bug previously, (which I believe was supposedly patched), where you could activate a gate (say, from room 1 to room 2) just as you were running out of time, and because gate activation made you temporarily invulnerable, when the site's doomsday-type effect kicked-in, it 'missed' you.
---
Maybe this is something similar, where the emergency warp mechanic from disconnecting made you invulnerable for those vital few seconds when you logged back in?
---
Who knows. Consider buying a lottery ticket...
---
&gt;ONLY 25% less
---
Uhhh, 25% is fucking huge.
---
If you can get two alts near to or above 5m SP you can farm SP on them as well as doing PI. Include Cybernetics V in your training.
---
I'm up voting for the hellcat
---
http://spinmaster.space/
---
www.grindr.com
---
Not HUGE per se, pretty important yes but I think its really a stretch to say 25% during the evenings and nights of a specific timezone is the game is totally dead. It still peaks at about the same mid-day.
---
We already know this would happen now all we need is to hammer capitals and rework anoms ez
---
You could do everyone a favor and just show us the wealth of experience you clearly have concerning all aspects of eve and stop pussyfooting around questions that dont fit your agenda
---
Are you looking at a different chart? Or forgot to put your contacts in?
---
Really looks like anoms and capitals need to be hammered
---
cringe
---
Neither. I‚Äôm looking at the cold hard data. 25% is very significant but I think saying the whole game is dead is really a stretch
---
Minimized fitting window linked to cargo would be enough.
---
Using mobile depot like dreads do while farming wh as battleship is not new, making it convinient would be really good.
---
Both peak and off peak are down Considerably 25% is fucking huge
---
&gt; Let me give you some insight to those players who aren't logging in.  
---
Bots
---
You want capital ships to be able to instantly blob people and you‚Äôre telling me about ‚ÄúI want my playstyle to be the best‚Äù 
---
If you had to actually pin your opponents down for five to ten minutes in order for your blob to work, you would require better strategy and ambush tactics to actually prevail.
---
Instantly deployed Caps have ruined PVP.  If you don‚Äôt think that, you‚Äôre one of the people living inside your own asshole.
---
Well most jumped on the same Band Wagon and I also saw posts and comments from the other side downvoted to oblivion.  Do how would you even read the opinion of all of them if one side gets silenced? 
---
I am also one of your hated nullseccers who really isnt too inclined to log in anymore after the latest changes. What I liked to do is now behind a artificial wall.
---
Looking at the graph, I don‚Äôt see a significant decrease in the peak activity
---
There are 2K systems in Wh space the fact that you saw no one is luck or you were sticking to low class whs. If you live in wh space you see people all the time. Ive been on null roams for hours and saw no one. Hunters arnt always successful in their hunt.
---
You're either trolling or blind, im not sure which
---
Neither. Look at the peaks. Do you see some noticable decrease? If anything July 15th was a slightly higher peak than the average a week before and the days before that are in line with the week before that
---
2 years seems a bit quick to collect enough data
---
July 15th didn't break 30k, the week before did I dont understand what your actually trying to prove here you also can't compare a Sunday to a Tuesday that's stupid, 
---
Your interpretation of this data is grossly incorrect
---
Confirmed falcon is testing local for 2 years
---
If only u were playing the game you would know there were drifters insta killing people for last 2 weeks.
---
What makes you think Im not playing? I know about the drifter stuff and what are you trying to prove?
---
TBH if the drifters came and sacked a couple of the major HS systems and there was a whole lore event between Concord getting punted in the attack and the pushback could be really epic.
---
Well, people always said "Adapt or die". Well, we adapted, you're dying.
---
Because it benefits their viewpoint to do so.
---
No, but you can put your IQ to work and see what is the jump range from all lowsec systems around Jita and you will know where to find JFs jumping, narrowing down by what NPC structures are around (best for instant docking), not all JF owners have blue citadels to jump to in lowsec.  You just need to work a little bit. Same retoric as nolocal stuff: let it be easy to gank 25bil JF via gates, right ? Just set up a 24/7 gatecamp and wait for the pinata, "i will resub for this" mentality. Guys are doing a great job ganking freighters even in hisec, and i don't hear them complaining. DSTs are not safer, you can get HICced while doing the mwd + cloak trick if the guy has sebo's. 
---
\- you can't build T3s in nullsec, you need WH stuff
---
\- you can't build lots of T2s in nullsec unless you have 15 accounts from which half of them are doing PI, and half of the mining ore and moon goo, and then you need some friends with the same amount of toons for reactions and stuff. This is a game, not a damn job, already got one IRL. 
---
\- you can't build many T2 rigs in a specific region, they require stuff that you can't find as salvage in that region. For example, with Serpentis salvage you can do armor related stuff (because they run gallente ships, armor?) no shield rigs. 
---
\- you can't build faction ammo and faction modules in nullsec. CCP even nerfed the 10/10 loot which i enjoyed to run a lot more than krab havens like a retard. 
---
This thing now it's more dangerous than a WH unless you are a big alliance. At least there you roll everything cand keep an eye on the static. Not warp to the new one even. And you are safe for some good hours.  In null you have gates + wormholes spawning. Reward is not even near the WH income for high class holes.
---
" There hasn't even been a week. " And when it's been a week and the trend continues what then? are you an all the rest going to admit hey maybe we were wrong? Fuck no, you'll tell people to HTFU even as eve continues to lose subscribers and players numbers because you don;t feel the way they play the game is valid.
---
what are you talking about?
---
i never once talked about reading opinions, i simply spoke about how stupid it is to say "lol reddit was WRONG" when clearly if you look at the majority opinion and the educated opinion reddit was very right (in this case).
---
&gt;I am also one of your hated nullseccers who really isnt too inclined to log in anymore after the latest changes. What I liked to do is now behind a artificial wall.
---
local was an artificial unrealistic and broken game system that persisted for far too long.
---
Yeah I'm pretty much fine with a massively superior opponent winning against an inferior opponent.
---
Why do you think it should be different?
---
This is exactly the point. Relaxing play style should not be associated with 0.0. The fact that Empire is more dangerous than 0.0 says it all and must be fixed. This is where drifters, blackout and whatever else needs to come in.
---
Better idea: The money that players pay to retrieve stuff from asset safety gets sents to players on the killmail. The players have to spend the isk anyway. So they get their stuff and the people who kill it get paid. Win win
---
Nope
---
I don't like it. see flair.
---
seriously though - i don't own a super and i get 0 value from hunting ratters.
---
so, what's actually left to do in nullsec if you don't like to rorqual mine or do industry? 
---
answer: dick all other than maybe sit on a titan in a ship that has tackle bonuses.
---
that was that one idiot who gates a super in ratting fit. there is always one guy .
---
People that buy plex with isk raise the price of PLEX, which then incentivizes people to buy plex with $$$ to get greater ISK for their $$$.
---
CCP likes people that pay for sub with ISK.
---
brainlet goons die to dreadbombs even easier.
---
It's kinda trivial but I played a while ago and remember owning a lab coat, I think it was a black and red version of the Exoplanets Data Analyst Lab Coat. Could anyone that knows please tell me the name of the coat I had? I can't find a market listing for it.
---
i can confirm that. got shot by one Nag gatecamping 1SU gate in LEM-I1
---
good argument
---
Exactly what I've been saying since this was announced. Blackout does literally nothing to fix the issues with the game. If the blackout were to remain, it literally only benefits large alliances. Even gobbins says so:
---
https://i.gyazo.com/137618b0d8b98a5fab698a5803ad3870.png
---
People with brains know this is a bad idea.
---
Sooo... nullsec pvp hasn't declined much in recent years?
---
to be fair, so can a human player with a moderately decent keyboard.
---
i know i have a macro set up to do it. however, i honestly don't think ~50m hour in a myrm is worth risking a ban for.
---
so yeah, this is just a boon to bots as there's now less actual people for them to compete with.
---
&gt; time to fire the data scientist
---
you can't. quant already jumped ship.
---
Our definitions of "fortunate" must differ quite a lot.
---
nah, just repurpose the local system scanner array we had for... 15 years now (its a pos thing)
---
Allowing capitals to enter anomalies was one of the worst decisions CCP ever made.
---
&gt;Any thoughts on how this will ultimately affect the players?
---
negatively.
---
look, if you want daily quests - wow does it better as they've been doing it for nearly 2 decades.
---
maybe if ccp want players to log in,  instead of throwing them fancy SP party weekends they just make a consistent and enjoyable game for us to log in to?
---
wait no, that'd involve some effort and creativity.
---
The way it should be.
---
Sure, I played mostly solo for the first few years and had a great time, but it depends on what you want from EVE. I find most MMO's are more fun to play with other people. EVE's learning curve can be a bit steep, but it sounds like you've already played a bit and are enjoying yourself. The learning curve is of course made easier when you're playing with a group of people who are familiar with the game and can help you out. It'll be harder to learn EVE playing solo, but you can still have a great time playing that way.  
---
Keep in mind that not all corps require you to use voice chat, though the PVP-focused corps tend to expect it. You could likely find a corp that's welcoming and understanding of your situation so you can play without needing to use voice chat.
---
&gt;vulnerable
---
&gt;capital move op
---
pick one
---
MORE SP
---
AGAIN 
---
yay?
---
About as vulnerable as a school of sharks with grenade launchers mounted on their heads.
---
I know that there will be at least one of those major things I will encounter when I'll play the game. And it's one thing that takes me aback quite a bit.
---
It is their fault. Everyone gets educated to the same level. Excuses make poor people along with work ethic and a false sense of entitlement.
---
And it wasn't before? Blackout gives you more tools to hunt with, but it doesn't mean that suddenly every system is filled to the brim with targets. You still have to put in effort.
---
It feels more full to me. Instead of knowing there's nobody there, I now assume there's someone there. Maybe they're at a deep safe. Maybe they're cloaked. But there could always be someone.
---
Shower thought: you're just a goon trying to meta and make it seem like the little guy isn't enjoying black out in hopes of getting ccp to fix your Farmville simulator.
---
&gt; And when it's been a week and the trend continues what then?
---
And when all the metrics show its better will you admit maybe you were wrong?
---
But also, you're still working under the faulty assumption that concurrent player count and the like is the most important metric.
---
That makes 1.
---
&gt;I guess everyone that has no supercap umbrella is fucked.
---
why guess?
---
you were told this the moment the announcement that blackout was coming happened.
---
it didn't take a genius to see the obvious, even if you couldn't see the obvious you had a shit load of warning this was going to be the outcome.
---
Imagine making a bait post and then replying to yourself.
---
Lol trying to pretend wormholes are dangerous üòÇ closing of entrances criting holes, rolling out bad ones no cynos on top of you, always a way to slow or stop incoming traffic,  stop drinking the koolaid thinking Wh is dangerous space
---
How's that?
---
So now that I am at work and you wish to get a more in depth Argument here we go. Local was something that was there from the beginning. So its natural to the game that there is a local in Nullsec. What CCP did was decidint that the vision the nullsec empires have of the game isnt there vision so they thrown in the drifters (which are a completely unrewarding foe) and now turned off local with that ominous blackout.   
---
The thing why all the people say its so great and good for the game is, because its against goonswarm and the imperium. As you know everyone on reddit hates the Imperium so everything that annoys them is great for the game.   
---
ALso yes, one guy is nothing lost, a couple thousand or more can start a cascade.
---
I could imagine . I got one and max skills for it but don‚Äôt have the nuts or isk to undock it
---
And this post isn't pushing one? As soon as you align yourself with one of the major blocs you are pushing an agenda.  
---
Screeching about agenda pushing because it's not your agenda is laughable.
---
Brakoo is still playing?!
---
&gt;  Everyone gets educated to the same level
---
No they don't, where are you getting this crazy idea? Poverty is a thing, and if you think everyone gets equal access to resources in this country you are misinformed.
---
Aww such sweet words, but honestly, Im merely a mortal. No more, nor less than you. But thank you for your faith and words of encouragement, I take them to heart!
---
I will now double my effort to convince my brethren of their fallacies.
---
Imagine having such a rich fantasy life that you think that I'd make a second reddit account just to troll your dumb ass. I can troll you lot just fine with my main, tyvm.
---
Or maybe don't be mega butthurt when one of your vnis dies? It is just a part of the game, and subcap rattinng is cheap enough that the isk/hour won't be affected too much even if you die more often than the previous zero times.  
---
You can blame ccp all day for fucking up the game, but players also have a say in the matter of how gameplay plays out on tq.
---
Yea they do, at least in this country.
---
can i have your stuff ?
---
The amount of poses in systems was limited by the number of moons, i feel like we should go back to that.
---
Oh cool, opening video to the game
---
A crit static is an invitation for any competent hunter to slip in and see your ratters. Then Ping for a Kiki fleet and proceed to stomp your shit. It happens all the time. Even rolling off all your holes is no guarantee. Groups rage roll. There is no way to know when it‚Äôs coming. No way to predict it. When they eventually find you and you are sieged in site you have few options for survival. Attempt to roll in their face or eat shit. There isn‚Äôt a cyno that brings in the Calvary. You just eat shit.
---
Leave hi sec /shrug
---
Oh my bad, yea it says people krabbing in nullsec deserve to be safe.
---
lower player count numbers probably mostly less bots tho. no need for cloaky camping because everyone is cloaked now. If you were one of the few people living outside of a major power block, like say a renter in Malpais, and you relied on local and a vast intel network to help you stay safe rather than an overwhelming pvp force you probably aren't having any fun. Yeah thats pretty much it.
---
This is about killing bots
---
You played for *14 years* and a *temporary* experiment by ccp makes you quit? How did you survive all the other dumbfuck shit that has happened in that timeframe?  
---
I think you were looking for an excuse to quit eve with or without blackout.  
---
Just take some time away from the game, and maybe come back at a later point when you can enjoy it again.
---
Nice!
---
What makes blues from just just farming each other ships or me placing my alt in friendly alliance and just blow it up multiple times?
---
Wtb kill trading for LP,  anyone from INIT up for trading ibis's at the sun?
---
they will all move to hisec courier missions. still 24/7, no human needs, with lvl4s you can get a decent chunk of isk if you have enough toons. So no null bots, but this solves the null problem, not the bot problem. Bots became a problem on Eve and on reddit when people spotted them but unable to kill them. This is the main frustration, not that they are screwing up economy. Maybe if i've seen in the past 2-3 threads about bots and PLEX prices, the rest are just complaining they can't catch and kill them.
---
Oh look. Pvp is flat. Almost like the black out is doing jack shit for pvp and just making paying subs no resub. Going to be fun when you roam a dead husk of a game because the only people left are hi sec and goons.
---
Sounds even better - if I'm blue then I've got all the time in the world to prep!
---
Lol, thats actually funny. Honestly, dont expect more from the same people who have been bitching for years on this sub.
---
Heya Falcon
---
I regret I never got into the lowsec scene of piracy and RP before you joined CCP. I just stopped by The Last Gate the other night to read me a piece of EVE history that I never had a chance to participate in and it made me sad.
---
I really hope you keep up the internal push to just try shit out and see what happens. The game desperately needs some chaos to revitalize it.
---
&lt;3
---
you already have it, stay in your hole.
---
Check Warp to Me (WTM) and The Valhalla Project (TVP). They should have training plans and so on. There is also https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Preparing_for_Incursions The skills for the different groups won't vary a lot.
---
It's a game and it has lore, better with this than news at 7 narrative.
---
your flair represents your idea
---
shit
---
I fucking love it. 
---
It has changed the meta tremendously and so many people are roaming nullsec now
---
DST? Anyone?
---
I'm not saying it isn't of course it is. but I doubt he's got 3-4 nestors or Rattlers on hand to do c5 sites. Or a nag
---
I mean if a Kiki gang can stuff there asses through a crit hole be my guest. Shit happens lol.
---
I was stoked at first about rorqual mining when excavators first came on the scene, and I rightly said that in order for them to be viable they had to each mine 300mill/hour. But, at that time it was under the assumption that they would have gotten the fighter mechanics due to the sisi bug giving them the 5 tube fighter UI and 0/0 m3 fighter bay. Since it would have greatly limited the multi box aspect. The talks on sisi at that very time came to the agreement that the real possible way CCP was gonna handle it was 30-60 second mining cycle by manual activation, and once the cycle was over you had to recall the fighters to collect the ore. With a MWD F2, and some form of self boost or combative F3 or no F3 at all. One even mentioned Deepcore F3. 
---
BUT. Rorqual buffs as they were in tandum with skill injectors just made for the worst possible outcome. So yes, as a long time Rorqual pilot I agree with removing their ability to mine. During this blackout I went back to my old mining ways. Rorqual in the middle surrounded by barges. Rorqual boosts+compresses, barges mine. My mining power is hardly diminished by the fact the rorqual isn't mining. 
---
I also agree with removing the panic module, from day one it went live on sisi I had said it was overpowered (and you guys wanted it to have a 10min cd with no burn out...that quickly changed when it was shown just how OP that was gonna be.) The panic module does nothing to promote smart play, and good fittings + good ship usage isn't pushed on new rorqual pilots, just "You don't need tank or dps, just hit panic and standing fleet will save you" 
---
As for orca's, eh, not really an issue, they can't mine enough to outpace a venture boosted by a Rorqual. (~22m3/s vs ~24m3/s) using T2 drones and 2x t2 rigs 1x t1 rig for drone mining, mining 16m3 per unit roids.
---
I would personally love it the capital line up of mining class ships got expanded. Each having it's own niche. Rather than having the Rorqual be the all-in-one ship (even removing the panic and mining aspect). I mean hell, the Rorqual still has it's 4 indy lines for BPO/BPC's it can use, we can have fun with that in WH's or small groups who cannot afford citadels or want to live the nomadic lifestyle.
---
But there is counterplay to recons&amp;cloaks, it's just not local chat anymore.  
---
&gt;[...] you cant see what isnt possible to see
---
It's almost as if this was the point of blackout. Break up near perfect intel coverage.
---
It tooks away the best tool i had for catching gangs trying to run from me bro. Shits a lot of effort to find nothing as they leave system whilst youre still scanning.
---
You still have to combat others to access the LP vendor. And only 1 alliance can win.
---
And how many bots? this update has completely fucked bots, they are practically unable to function in nullsec now
---
Along with krabs not logging in because they think it‚Äôs temporary, I think you can account for a lot of the lost ‚Äúplayer‚Äù count.
---
What ISK? If you read the whole thing, the items cannot be sold.
---
same happens IRL when some government takes a decision
---
That's today. That's this week. Now, imagine a month of this.
---
Now, imagine this possibility: A new sov structure that allows the defender to see Local but locks the attacker out. So they see you but you can't see them.
---
Oh yes, please remove all context from the kills that happened, and then ignore that just because shit is still dying, it doesn't mean that null is healthy.
---
Do you put any thought in your posts or do you just throw shit at the wall and see what sticks?
---
Do you always ramble incoherently on social forums?
---
What abyss tier is ceiling for alpha? I think it's t4? Or it will be too hard? Imo electrical with active tank will be doable?
---
Do you have other to harass or do you just have no life?
---
.... mods?
---
Thank you for saving me from having to type this out on a phone. I appreciate it.
---
As you originally asked about burners, fit the nergal for them and test it on SISI (the test server). If you lose it there it won't hurt. If it works, print isk on tranquility.
---
I don't get what your point is?
---
A titan does not require a local chat to boson.
---
It's a +1 from me.
---
Which is beautiful!
---
Then ditch the penalties and only allow them for haulers?
---
can y'all just like
---
give thalack dalhar his walking papers tho?
---
or is he the only person who still does anything for isd

Sorry for hijacking, I‚Äôve recently come back to this game (3rd day) after being away... 4.5 years. I don‚Äôt really know anyone playing and a lot of things seem different. I remember an API system  and being able to walk around in a lounge area or something but my question is, is there a good source for finding Corps or likeminded people? Somewhere to ask Q&amp;A stuff and get me back on my feet. A lot seems to have changed from when I last played and for all in intents purposes I‚Äôm basically noob again.
---
Dude totally down great idea I will get my indi alts to build them in batches of 50 see you soon.
---
Can you answer the only question?
---
1. What is the yield for players comes from blackout?
---
While people like to talk about cutthroat environment in EVE, they seem to forget that carebears and other non pvp focused people are one of the drivers for content. Hell, even pvpers run pve activities. If you make it too difficult this part there will be no targets, thus less pvp content. I think removing cynos would be great. Removing local could make more stress on people running pve content. Lowsec rewards are not nearly high enough to offset that. Highsec lvl4s would be more isk/hr and that is the problem.
---
Let the gang tackle anything in your space, and then instead of dropping the super hammer on them escalate with a sub fleet. Easy content, no local needed.  
---
Or you can follow them with an interceptor and keep eyes on them. Maybe have a newbro do it so they get experience scouting and you don't burn your fc out.  
---
There are ways to deal with your problem, they involve more effort/risk though.
---
Changing local is one thing, but deleting it is another :)
---
Even dabigredboat said that he was all in favour of CHANGING/delaying local, but downright deleting it is too powerful vs the WH comparison.
---
Personally I actually make shortterm isk on this, since Im a trader (on vacation) and my pricelevels when I put them up aprox 10 or more days ago, are now quite low vs the current level, since the production costs are spiking. So my inventory should clear quickly, and does. So if I want to liquidate, this is a good thing. Hell, I got out of the PLEX market at 4.3m.
---
I do agree that a shakeup was needed, but it looks to me CCP just went with the easy and cheap option of just removing a feature, instead of balancing/tweaking it, which would require development hours/cost.
---
And the question is; while the health of this change will show itself in data after x weeks, and if CCP sees actual dramatic drop in Subs/logins, will they be able to reengage the unsubbed players?
---
They might with a good patch/expansion, but given how cheap/lazy they went with the local removal, I dont have high hopes.
---
don't blockade runners have a bonus to warp speed as well? think it's possible to get one of them up to a really unreasonably high warp speed
---
Hope you dont quit.
---
Where are they? Because the stat's don't reflect this narrative (refer to sutonias post earlier today)
---
...says the guy who literally had to beg CCP to nerf the game so that they could actually play in nullsec.
---
I am fairly new and only recently acquired a DST. Moonwalking away from things is fun, but I don‚Äôt get why you‚Äôd do it for a combat ship. If it‚Äôs a combat ship wouldn‚Äôt you, oh I don‚Äôt know, start shelling the sod that tackled you and pray their friends didn‚Äôt show up?
---
I would like to see this. I know there are so many things that need to be fixed in this game , that we could talk about for days, among those things there's also missions who indeed haven't been touched in ages.
---
Even BjornBee started multiboxing for that reason, lol. He runs a Drekavac and 1 Guardian + 2 Rodivas for reps...
---
You're just making my boner harder.
---
I left when I realized there was no real risk in this game that can't be trivialized. They should revert warp to zero too.
---
Every coalition has something like near2 that gives alerts based on ingame intel provided by people. Im not calling bots or anything cause actual bots didnt need intel bots with local
---
most people didn't do anything with haw guns, bosons, fax, or carriers in april 2016 due to waiting for a better understanding of the mechanics and building fax caches
---
the real reason april 2016 has a spike, i suspect, is related to the question of whether or not suitonia counted pos mods as "ship kills"
---
Unless you've also been subbed for 10+ years... I've given CCP enough cash.
---
Great execution bud, yer doin' terrific.
---
I‚Äôve been travelling through high, low on my way to null, more than a few times I‚Äôve been instalocked on gates with my DST.
---
So whats the counter? Please, explain to me how you are saving your excavators from bombers.
---
D-scan dude, on d-scan. Was that the point? To make d-scan irrelevant?
---
It's ok to be disappointed and you have some good arguments. It is unfortunate that you add to it the whole drama and quitting part nobody cares about.
---
You also missed that it is a test. Why not try it for 1 more week, give time for nullsec corps to adjust their tactics and see if it really is that bad?
---
if suitonia counted pos mods as ship kills, that would single handedly explain it
---
in april 2016, tishu, horde, cdiat, ncdot... lots of people, basically, spent most of our time bashing offline sticks in pb/fade/dek/tribute/vale/branch waiting for goons to undock something for us to shoot
---
Oh ye. Just camp a day or so and they will prob be running around doing their thing. But I think they have paused for a while. Atleast in certain areas.
---
Im usually the FC and i have no control over any number of super pilots who want to drop on everything that moves in my space. I work with my buddies chasing gangs out of delve and catching them in further regions in subcaps and funnel them into dead end systems so i can have a brawl. I cant do this without knowing theyre in the system. If i take time to scan the system they can and most probably will be long gone meaning my only chance at engaging them is quelle surprise dropping a super on them and now thats just no fun for anyone now is it. This change completely fucks with fights. Its only fun for ganks. Id prefer to not have supers over the dumb no local. The no local doesnt increase risk for me it just creates busywork when i could you know be fighting people and creating risk for gankers and other gangs. To me and the people i run with its a content killer.
---
&gt;What would a goon know about that? Go punch old ladies at the bus stop.
---
Contrary to popular belief, the players in goonswarm are not evil.
---
Did you know plex is not seeded to the markets? Did you also know if people don't buy plex, it is not worth shit, if its not worth shit people won't pay rl cash for it to sell it, If people don't buy it ccp makes no money. did you also know that the bots are business as usual, as they are probably smart enough to read dscan or have gate eyes,
---
But please drink the koolaid and tell me how eve is thriving after hitting an all time low in the last what decade?
---
Tym owadem zielonym z mikrofonem na taksowce troche mi humor poprawiliscie ale nieduzo wiec sie nie cieszcie zbytnio
---
Explo bots in null are still around. Ive actually seen tons more of them since the drifter thing started. But ye, they can move to HS.
---
Its being used as an argument for no local. Which is what bothers me. People have gone so far as to place the entirety of player count drop as bots not logging in. Im saying thats being naive as bots wont stop and using them as an excuse to fk over every nullseccer is weak.
---
Average vni: 20mill per tick, 3 ticks an hour, * 24 hours: 1440m per day.
---
" When you bot 24/7, your VNI yields around 0.5B isk a day. Do the maths "
---
Thinking
---
&gt; jumping in to my first worm hole and sweating for 3 hours because I forgot to bookmark it before finding a WH to normal space after 4 WH jumps.
---
There's a few habits to develop ducking blind into wspace, bookmarking both sides of the hole is one of them.
---
But the bots! Wont you think of the bots! Everything bad can be explained but bots! Do you not hate bots? Are you a bot apologist? BOTS SPODAMMIT
---
I am assuming the bare minimum ticks, with minimal skills and mods some bits appear to use. To that you add the interruptions when the bit 'sees' neuts in local, warps off etc.
---
while i agree with your speculative conclusion, i think we don't have enough data to say for sure
---
i think most of the people high on blackout are wormholers or smallgangers who have no real stake in the game beyond using it as an arcade pvp simulator and they're enthusiastic about the blackout because it lets them collect much more mlg montage footage against idiots too dumb to adapt to mechanics
---
in the meantime, i'm noticing trends like the fact that npc kills flatlining in traditionally extremely krab-dense regions and pages and pages of excavator killmails meaning that the people who generate wealth and materiel are simply not playing the game right now. people though delayed local was going to mean easy frags on nullbears, but they forgot that the nullbears actually have brains and thought that too, and the nullbear solution was to just not log in
---
EVE cycle of death right now bud. Raters are quiting, gankers will waste time exploring deserted areas and quit game after some time with no content.
---
"Adapt" thing is a big F word with middle finger to most of the players touched by changes. If anyone say you should adapt they just disrespect your playstyle and dont give a sh\* about fun you had.
---
Blackout is ruining Eve from inside out. Next thing we get are SP for grinding kills. Common, this game is getting more and more like WoW and I hate to see that ....
---
Also been in C4, C5 and C6s, still empty AF. Maybe it's the TZ.
---
I prefered Razor when I hadn't found them if im honest with you
---
So is the problem that you can't catch and kill a sub million ship, or that this ship is running timers faster than you can contest them?
---
Solution to the latter, allow militia pilots to spend thirty seconds to reset the plex timer. This takes it from however much enemy captured to the original starting point faster than any dplexing fleet can capture the system.
---
Players can still use ventures, players can still disengage, but leaving carries a real time cost.
---
For the record everyone took my comment way out of context - I knew there was a dumbass that had been gate camping in a Vedetta for a long time and that different hostiles were very aware of him / planning a gank. I thought maybe this was a ‚Äòlong play‚Äô by Vert and was impressed it finally came to fruition, but I guess this wasn‚Äôt the deal.
---
I‚Äôm not sure how you got ‚Äúpolitical‚Äù out of that previous comment though, but then again you are pretty dumb so I‚Äôm not surprised.
---
Regarding structure spam, one option at lsumcvoulf have been that a citadel or engineering complex has to be placed at a planet, in the same way that refineries have to be placed at a moon. Would make some systems more valuable based on how many planets they have too
---
But it's too late for that now obviously. Hindsight is 20/20 and all that
---
I haven't killed or seen a single bot this weekend. I don't mind it staying that way or them dying to cloaky campera all the time, when they are rewritten, with scouts dscanning.
---
I explained who pays for the plex and it is not botters who probably pay like 1 month intially to boostrap themselves. I can write it slower, if need be.
---
Nullsec is not "far more dangerous" in any way, especially when you look at the points you presented.
---
&gt; I keep pointing it out, but I'll say it again: you can't do anything to a stargate to deny a hostile entity the use of it. You can crit or roll most wormholes as a method of access control to a wormhole.
---
It is what allows for groups to live and work together without being stuck to single system, which means you can reliably have more than about 30-50 people.
---
&gt; No cynos in wormholes. Do I really need to explain how a lack of knowledge of who is in system at any given time combined with cyno mechanics now makes null infinitely more dangerous than it was before?
---
Cyno is a tool available to both sides and even with no local it's not uncounterable mechanic - albeit it does require decently sized group actively working together to be able to get themselves set up. Ironically, huge part of "how will nullbears deal with cynos and no local" is entirely next point.
---
&gt; Local has gone but all of the tools used by hunters remain. This one is the real kick in the gut. Local is blacked out due to Drifters making it blah blah blah... Ok, whatever, but if that's the case, then how is it that I can still find every other statistic about what's happening in any nullsec system? I can see pilots in space, NPC kills, jumps, ship kills, pod kills. I can see even more statistics on Dotlan (especially NPC kills delta). I can highlight+link in chat the name of any nullsec solar system in the game and then pop over to the sovereignty tab and see if the military and industrial indexes are going up or down, indicating if there is PVE activity in the system, and based on the level, how well used that system is. I CAN SEE THIS FROM ANYWHERE IN EVE, EVEN SITTING IN JITA 4-4. None of this information is available for wormholes. You jump into a wormhole you have no idea whether that wormhole is currently occupied and active unless you look. For a nullsec system, you can sit in Delve and say, hey, somebody is ratting up a storm in Omist, or looks like there's a mining op going on in Cobalt Edge. There's no way to hide.
---
And this is what still makes nullsec vastly different from wormholes. Because all those tools (and more, you forgot existence of locator agents, ingame map that shows cynos and a few more) are available freely to both sides. It is up to anybody how they use those tools, playing field is right now much more equal - because whether you're a hunter or a prey, you need to find a way to get necessary intel in order to be aware of any imminent dangers. Nullsec is basically defined by static geography (static gates and system positions for needs of jump drive), this makes having various intel sources necessary to somewhat level playing field and allow for both proper preparation and proper counterplay to planned, days-spanning hunting ops. Defenders and dealing with roamers is still at advantage, except now it requires some level of coordination and cooperation from any group living in null, including some level of proactive threat checking.
---
Have you considered that with the blackout there will be a change in meta and maybe a vni is no longer meta anymore? That possibly there are ships out there you could rat in that will shit all over tackle bombers? Maybe fly those ships? It took me all of like 2 hours to come up with 3 different ships that will shit on cloaky tackle and outrun anything bigger.
---
I think you have a different experience of the blackout exactly because you are in goons though. From what I saw delve largely carried on as normal
---
Has it?
---
Because other than making subcap near useless for ratting and replacing excavs with augmented mining drones, the meta doesn't seem to have changed one damn bit.
---
Above all I never got the push to reduce data available.
---
Like, the most accurate simulation of a market, the innumerable 3rd party tools and an active dev community, some of the most complex datasets ever available in gaming, players utilising different numbers to aid their decisions... Aren't those things why EVE is different from other MMOs? Now that this sub want dotlan and zkill blackouts to last, what next? Scrap markets and force everyone to use contracts because markets have those 0.01isking bots?
---
FUCK YES!
---
why?
---
So basically you threw shit at a wall in hopes it would stick like the rest of these shitty posts we've seen today alone
---
You might have it still in the cosmetic menu, by the cloning bay and stuff in a station.
---
Been playing since 2007, yet to have a solo kill... grats man! at least in my eyes a huge accomplishment!
---
I heard about a director who retired and sold off his 10+ accounts to someone that now runs a corp in Snuff... this the same guy? 
---
Pray for the rain you gotta deal with the mud dirt, might wanna keep dry :P
---
It doesn‚Äôt even need to be halved really, just some way to influence your gains directly. Game design where the best way to train is log off, isn‚Äôt very fulfilling to play.
---
It‚Äôs time to meet how about desis dan
---
extorting people for wormhole exits.
---
my best was i had a whole conversation with someone in a C13 local by changing my ship name to reply so i didn‚Äôt reveal my identity. i got several hundred million for the location of an exit wormhole in the end which i left in a jet can around some random planet or something before i left.
---
There was a time when it was hard and expensive to get any capital, each cap kill was celebrated and there weren't any cap blobs at all with twice the player count. Now people use dreads to suicide and a carrier costs less that a decent t3c. Is it really that much about human nature?
---
If you are so afraid of darkness you have an option to just crab in a BO with everlit cyno in a neighboring system
---
Does the another queue activate at the time ofpurchase? Or can you save it for another time?
---
I agree 100%. As soon as I saw news of the blackout, I immediately unsubbed my accounts. It is poorly planned, poorly communicated, and not at all a good experiment to just throw into the mix completely ad lib.
---
Like you, I was also a big contributor to my corp, and on fleets almost every day, recruiting, training and coaching newbros. This was a step too far. Null is not J-space; and it never should be. Player retention was already fucking terrible, and CCP finally acknowledged that with some hard facts. Now here's another part of space they cannot take part in by increasing the complexity of learning without increasing the volume of learning output from the developer themselves.
---
 And frankly I'm surprised by the amount of people claiming to be resubbing due to this whole thing. So surprised I don't believe it.
---
Oh. And the articles making their rounds of the internet are by people who have never played the game. One such article claimed that local provided direct intel of what ship people were flying and refused to acknowledge lowsec in its entirety.
---
It's embarrassing where we've come to.
---
agreed. i still have to train 2.5 million SP for x11 skills for level 5s. Injectors don't help me, unless i spend a fortune (which i won't), for 150k SP from 940m isk, it's not worth it. Yeah and i will hear: just create a new toon, inject that. I mainly like to play with my main, having also some alts but for different side purposes.
---
If player count wasn't so important, we wouldn't be getting daily quests.
---
Yeah there was a time before civilization, communities, laws, and the agricultural revolution where the human race were largely nomadic, living off the land, killing random things and dying early. Yes, the human species that survived (sapiens) weren't stronger than others, but they formed communities and now they chat on reddit communities asking is it really human's tendency to form groups and communities that makes us strong.
---
&gt;And when all the metrics show its better will you admit maybe you were wrong?
---
concurrent player count is a rather important metric based on CCP's actions over the past few years
---
Whenever you cater to people who play one way, you are obviously going to irritate people who play a sandbox game a different way.  I'd be surprised if this is a big net positive move for the playerbase size.
---
wh = nullsec
---
confirmed
---
Isn't TVP dead?
---
That's what super umbrella does to a human brain.
---
cope
---
As an industrialist myself, you're full of shit.
---
fixed it
---
First nullsec blackout
---
Now J-hole leading to nullsec?
---
Drifters are breaking the boundaries between worlds
---
Need to nerf wormholes into the ground. Make them stupid risky with no reward. They have to be worse than nullsec.
---
I'm sure that replacing those dreads cost less than the vendetta ;)
---
i don't think that nullsec is healthy. Outside of the powerhouses it allways was dangerous to mine, pick up PI, move stuff around. And even under the supercap umbrellas ships died everyday, rorqs as wel as supers and titans.
---
Now the smaller entities will suffer the most, and the bigger will get bigger and fatter than before.
---
If you compare the current plex price to that from 2008 (300-350M) or even 2010 with 500M, it's now 2B. If CCP would have adjusted the ressources needed to build something according to the possibility to mine huge amounts with better and better ships, everything would be fine now. They just would have to add 20-30% to every mineral/PI/moonmat in the blueprints.
---
If they had done this, the production of a titan today would be at 250-300B, not 45-50.
---
i mean, aren‚Äôt most comments about needing pve to make it easier for hunters to kill them?
---
Hell that was the ONLY reason most people wanted blackout
---
Skill injectors are the issue, not a fucking promotional event. But I bet you use skill injectors because you can afford them, just don't want the players without billions being able to marginally work towards catching up.
---
Did you really think of that in the shower
---
I'm sure they have metrics that differentiate people logging in to claim the SP and people in space.
---
Buddy, take a step back.  Chill
---
This is an experiment, no one knows how the dust is going to settle. 
---
 Even if this does become permanent as always the first people to adapt and find a way will profit and then the rest will follow.
---
The market will reflect how hard it is to get resources/isk.  Everything will balance out.
---
Shhh lets not talk about how PvP numbers have gone down aswell during what seems to be the blackout. And the fact that null warfare seems to be the best method of lowering NPC kills. We dont wanna burn for blasphemy.
---
Everyone disregard, nothing to see here.
---
What about 50m / hour times 23 hours? That would equate to around 11.5b?
---
Just curious how did you get ganked? I see most people do it in front of Jita and concord should show up pretty quick?
---
I don't have access to the account anymore, I was just wondering if anyone knew what it was called so I could get it on my new character.
---
This is the manager's idea which came to him in his sleep last night, and he thinks he is technical and knows how to code. Then he gets the coffee in the morning and calls everyone for a meeting. He explains all this shit, and how easy it sounds, but the actual coding is 1000 times harder. 
---
Stop posting about how easy it is to do this and that without actually having some coding skills, you make our brain hurt.
---
I haven't noticed shit.
---
Before blackout: Get dropped, call supers
---
After Blackout: Get dropped, call supers
---
grr gon hat gon
---
I've had a VNI running most of the day in Eso- Nothing. Not one hunter. I even left to do house work- Came back to a living VNI still orbiting. To assume "all subcap pve ships can't even undock" is a little exagurated...
---
@ccp falcon why are you guys not adding new content? Why??? I don't understand.
---
You can also counter play warp disruption by not getting within ~29km of a ship with a long point, which is far more engaging than fitting a module.
---
Tldr more krabs doesn't equal more kills because lol hunting in 2k19
---
Alpha is good stuff, I got myself omega solely for the cloak, but if not for that, I'd still be playing for free
---
The point of eve is huge-scale warfare fueled by industrialists deep back. Being unable to gather intel in own space while everyone else can is totaly, absolutely implausible and stupid. 
---
And if your definition of fun is childlish self-assertion through griefing - gtf out of my game.
---
&gt; drink the koolaid
---
  You were on a winner until you shit the bed with this stale old edgy phrase
---
Ty! But why is PGL there then?
---
Just put some storms  that give various bonuses and drawbacks around gates and planets. Maybe even storms that jump ships around the grid, system or even region. Just do something ffs
---
NPCs can warp away, we've seen they can use drones in the abyss, we have burner missions. Why not combine elements of that sort or thing I.e. a mission where outage to kill a specific NPC but they will warp if you don't tackle them, or fewer rats but they are tougher or use drones as well etc
---
The bots are dumb as fuck. They aren't smart enough to do much if anything.
---
&gt;we want botting removed from this game
---
  *less bots login during blackout leading to less logged in characters
---
  &gt;WAIT LOOK AT PLAYER COUNT EVE IS DYING NOW
---
  Which is it- Do you want to see bots removed? Or do you prefer an artificial inflation of "player" numbers?
---
I don't have 23 hours a day to play. Nor is it my primary income source.
---
Atron and a vendetta
---
You win some n lose some i guess
---
Exactly this. 
---
I am looking forward when hunters will start to cry bcs there is none to gank/fight.  Bcs they are only looking for prey that is not shooting back...   And those preys are either quiting or fighting back right now.  I for one will be now baiting a lot to fock those hunters and enjoy how they are crying bcs there is no more easy kills for them anymore... 
---
Anyway in other  reddit thread CCP Falcon already said and confirmed that this blackout is mainly for boost hunters...
---
It made me join fleets this weekend. 
---
On the downside it made people not log in so there's that.
---
Maybe next time ccp can ship a bonus, like I dunno rare asteroid and npc  spawns in systems with no local that have allot of players...
---
interesting fact, there used to be a mmo (ryzom) where players had access to zone editing tools.
---
Was widely popular in its small community and people did crazy good content.
---
https://en.wiki.ryzom.com/wiki/Ring
---
chances of seeing a similar concept in eve is slim to none tho due to the way the mission engine is designed.
---
&gt; even big blocks tell their members to not rat/do not undock big toys
---
  citation needed
---
It is a great tool. Gives you direction of where the other ships are heaving. Your lock range, guns range position in respect on where your ship.  Distance easier to read and faster. Although not as exact as overview.
---
This are the ones I can list on top of my mind.
---
Bullshit.  If you, say, completely gut capital application to anything other than npcs, other caps and structures (making it so caps require subcap support to operate effectively), complaints about cap umbrellas would almost disappear overnight.
---
The problem isn't that people group together, it's that the game balance is still totally fucked.
---
MAKE IT HAPPEN
---
As a nullsec bloc member i love it, but as an eve player, i hate it.
---
Clearly smart enough to convince everyone they have left the game...
---
You mean the month with almost record low npc kills?
---
"I want to be in my safe dead end system and krab 23 hours a day in total safety"
---
  - Translated the post for everyone here
---
It doesn't though, it is just your smoothbrain trying to find a trend.
---
Do Line 1 - Line 2 if you want your trend.
---
You do realize that TEAMPLAY is the perfect counter to cloaky non scannable ships right? As most arent combat power houses. Plus it's probably only gonna be a solo dude or a small gang trying to gank you anyways. 
---
Get your like minded krabbers together and form a fucking defense fleet lol
---
Grath, telling it how it is.
---
I agree with you for the most part, though from my experience point 1 has been improved simply because the hype the blackout generated has more people out in space looking for fights.
---
Whether or not that's sustainable is another story.
---
Read my post. Excavs are probably gonna need a survivability buff in my opinion if blackout is permanent.
---
LOOOOL  
---
Nice marketing and promoting CCP. 
---
So to not loose players during that stupid blackout idea , you will do some skill points for free events.  Well played CCP , well played...
---
&gt;completely gut capital application to anything other than npcs, other caps and structures
---
Have your cake and eat it too. Complain about PVErs and then complain when they use caps to PVP.
---
Since they are more successful in their end game process for the sandbox, building communities and caps, screw them because my failure to do so should be the basis of CCP's action and I want those caps nerfed so my frigate can kill their caps.  Grrrr successful people.
---
Which post? The one that doesn't have data from July?
---
You cannot even get your fucking timeline right.  May 2016 was WWB not the 'northern war'
---
Goons weren't even in fucking delve in 2016.
---
[This is what the map looked like on May 31, 2016, but knowing that would require you to have a clue beyond ship fits](http://web.archive.org/web/20160428211954/http://go-dl1.eve-files.com/media/corp/coalitionsov/Coalitioninfluence.png)
---
If you're moving a hull uniftted and it's not from a blue citadel to a blue citadel then you are doing something wrong tbh.
---
Why indeed. Bonused combat probes? Decent tank when not shitfit? Some space for ship scanner? If not nullified, having 3.5s align time and almost 9AU/s + 20-something km scram on Proteus (again, if not shitfit)? Smartbomb for decloaking support?
---
Deleet this
---
Why should they be worse than nullsec? It doesnt take an hour to long into your intel channel and you dont get a limited number of sites per week. You also have assest safety and cynos.
---
Just because both spaces have the same local mechanic now doesnt mean they are equal risk my dude
---
look... concurrent logins are not everything.
---
There is pilots out there that will login with 20-30-40-50 rorq pilots at a time to strip a belt.  with the black out that person is no longet loggig in all 50 alts... maybe 5-6 but not 50.  now thats 45 users not logged in ....
---
Then you have to take into consideration just how many crabs do this on a daily basis... and there is your numbers
---
And what if I'm going to be on vacation with no access to a computer in late august?
---
This wasnt in response to your post. I want to hear that guys response.
---
Well said, goon drone number 36437, your silent F1 pushing in the exact number of fleets needed to make your PAP requirement must have helped alot, since you‚Äôre coming here to boast about it.
---
How typical, solving a pvp problem through PVE.
---
Weirdest I seen is a fleet of 3 wings. First wing is mission runners doing what they do. After the finish this "room", second wing warps in to salvage and the first moves on. Any areas that have minable minerals, third wing warps in to strip mine the area. No ISK ledt behind i suppose...
---
No, it looks like just #qty.
---
Killing 1 npc frig = killing 1 player super.
---
&gt;ago  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;lower player count numbers probably mostly less bots tho. no need for cloaky camping because everyone is cloaked now. If you were one of the few people living outside of a major power block, like say a renter in Malpais, and you relied on local and a vast intel network to help you stay safe rather than an overwhelming pvp force you probably aren't having any fun. Yeah thats pretty much it.
---
Wow that sounds terrible from a repetitive motion injury standpoint.  Half of people's want to leave WH space when they do is not wanting to spam dscan constantly.
---
when i hear that whistle blowing, i hang my head and cry
---
Imo. I see it  as an embodiment of: "Its harder to take something back once its given."
---
As Nullblocks have been fed favorable updates for years. Its hard to suddenly have a reverse in that thinking.
---
Use combat probes. Patrol your space. Be active. Have gatecamps running. Be on comms. Learn how to fight.  
---
If your shit gets bombed pay more attention and pull that shit. Or don't mine with excavs.  
---
Force recons are actually quite shit in most matchups, they are force *multipliers*, that means for them to be effective you still need a gang that isn't d-scan immune.
---
&gt;Yes, people that aren't paying attention will get caught even by bad "gankers".
---
&gt;But people that are paying attention are very difficult to catch. Before the black out even barely paying attention was enough to be extremely difficult to catch.
---
Except mining vessels, as per my earlier example, will be easy to catch. 
---
&gt;Now it's actually a game of cat and mouse.
---
I think the cat should actually have to search for the mouse, more so than they do at this point.
---
Don't worry about being unable to use salvaging drones. They're not worth it.
---
Make a mechanic where people don't post weird ass stupid mechanic suggestions.

is all it requires, not even undocking. The invasion ones will be done in high sec.
---
And in this comment, we see that the unfortunately named 'smartdots' did not live up to his name.
---
I would vote to make you an emperror at CCP.
---
Galaxy NEEDS to feel dangerous! Oh how I wish \*\_\*
---
Maybe to balance it out for newbros, make initial Empire Corps more significant, and get some national police to actually DEFEND assaulted players belonging to Empire, instead of only punishing the guilty.
---
Likewise there could be Empire NPC Police roams in their owned lowsec systems where players could participate to defend Empire citizens from pirates and so forth.
---
Would actually encourage newer people to try out lowsec, not only for PvP, and make Empire/NonEmpire space feel different.
---
2 Rattlesnakes can do C5, with some bling. 3 Nestors is comfortable and allows you to run the Drifter, especially if you bring a low SP alt in a regular battleship to be retard magnet. So C3s only make sense if you are truly solo.

If only they'd delete this sub reddit indefinitely I feel that would have a positive impact on the game
---
&gt; Since they are more successful in their end game playstyle for the sandbox
---
With this kind of attitude there are no balance issues in any game, ever...
---
No offense but you are just regurgitating what everyone else keeps saying without actually thinking it through.
---
"Most arent combat power houses", I guess you dont know what bombers can do. 
---
For one, excavs will get raped. No amount of buffs are gonna fix that. Atleast try to make a decent suggestion before just glossing over the fact that Rorquals now have to eat excav losses on a regular. Which will basically make them entirely useless since those are not cheap.
---
Secondly, you can set up traps for supers whilst being in the system. Superduper ez. No defense fleet can save you from that. 
---
And thirdly, TEAMPLAY... What? Does teamplay stop interdicted ships? I didnt know that. Does it stop covert cynos? Really? 
---
You are totally missing some key elements to what certain situations can, will and is happening due to this. And being active wont stop any of it, having defense fleets with fellow "krabbers" wont fucking stop any of it. So unless you have real suggestions as to how to actually counter outside of useless crap, then maybe dont pretend like you get why people are arguing against this. Because clearly, you have no idea.
---
&gt;We've broken login records over the weekend, CCP wants to throw an extra promotion in
---
Why are you spreading misinformation. The only info we have currently is concurrent players, and that's down.
---
I know the narrative is that this event is an overwhelming success, but making shit up to suit your opinion is pretty weak.
---
So you would rather have bots driving up the price of plex ?
---
hey bro whats your main account?
---
If you don't want content to get chased away then leave the supercap umbrella.  
---
I agree that the game becomes more ganky with no local. But that is still a good thing, ships need to blow up for this game to properly function.  
---
I'm sorry that your particular playstyle has become obsolete, i've been there before. But it is what it is for the duration of blackout, so just improvise and overcome. Finding new ways to blow up other people is fun in its on way.
---
Wait, so nullsec fights are too big for you and wormhole fights are too small?  You want the exact size fights you want handed to you on a platter without you having to look for them at all?
---
Sounds like a *you* problem.
---
Every editor has a motive or a point of view they wish to push, wonder what this guys is?
---
dis iz so retardid ai jus had n neruism. pls post nevur agen nd biomas tx xoxo
---
Because of course, you know who's actively playing the game, as you're privy to information CCP give only to you, and nobody else.
---
I can agree but also holding a 5 is harder PvP wise in a sense. Idk your not wrong. I didn't realise it only took two rattles.
---
i have no real thoughts or opinions
---
I would rather have players,  as I only know of players who have quit, and players who have cancelled alts, and I still see plenty of bots so this story of 'all the bots have quit hurr durr' is so misguided and full of shit,  the krabbers have quit, they were actual players
---
Yes, blackout leans more towards favouring pvp and small gang... But this is literally the first time in years CCP has done something that benefits that community.
---
A community that has been decimated by countless changes that have only benefitted the PVE game play.
---
So saying that you are a PVPer, however as a result of blackout you are quitting feels to me as an over reaction to a change that you should be happy about.
---
Why not wait and see how this progresses? Why not still play EVE and create the content that the small gang community you lead may need.
---
Blackout is not the final solution and CCP are clearly gathering data. Balancing and adjustments will be brought in.
---
We will see how it plays out, yes blackout won't revitalize the game on it's own.  
---
But it's an important gesture to the pvp community to show them that they are not forgotten.
---
&gt;With this kind of attitude there are no balance issues in any game, ever...
---
I subscribed to a sandbox, if my enemies have more supers than me, so be it? I joined knowing what I was getting into. I didn't join for developers to start modifying things to weaken my enemy. I'd rather compete and work ways to attack. 
---
The keyword: work.   
---
Not charge credit, undock  shoot, die, post on reddit and say those that worked more have more ships and more friends, it isn't fair. Nerf friends, and nerf their X Y Z ships, plz CCP.
---
CCP stopped publishing this data for wormholes because it was too strong of an intel tool.
---
I smell bait..
---
&gt;You are not allowed to complain that EVE subs are down at monday just to turn around complaining about events that try counter that effect on tuesday. 
---
They'll complain, while at the same time refusing to accept that subs, logins, concurrent players or any other metric is down. And the ones that do accept it claim that everyone who hasn't logged on is a bot who doesn't count. 
---
Then they'll go blob "PvP" a lone mining barge, before getting bosoned in delve and chatting shit online about how many kills they're getting since the event started.
---
Oh my god, you are solo roaming and you found content, good for you ! You drowned in content !
---
Are you accounting for the multiples gangs from different coalitions that said the exact reverse ?
---
Did you login in the last 10 years ?
---
Oh no, you found other roaming gangs the first weekend of the blackout when the hype was at its peak, so strange.
---
Apart from that, space was empty as hell, good luck next weekend when people will have given up.
---
&gt;CCP need to consider hiring/talking to some behaviorist before ~~implementing changes to the game~~ letting Stainguy post
---
go back and play WoW if you want soulbound items and you didn't find the different wording for Eve
---
Better yet bring back local where i can kill more dudes sustainably without having to only gank. Cos ganking is boring as fuck. You're not going to convince me that it's somehow an improvement when my pvp quality is reduced to hit and run on the defenceless.
---
Sorry, what do you mean?
---
I just want to know whether the game has gotten better enough to come back.
---
By the way, I hope CONCORD has gotten stronger and figured out ways to prevent kamikazes (suicide ganks) in high-sec. I didn't like to see my 128m ISK shipment of that precious red mineral (begins with "M" - Megacyte or something like that I think?) get stolen after my truck-ship got destroyed in high-sec.
---
Lol I fucking knew it. You have no fucking clue what you are talking about. Like literally zero. These suggestions are all horrendous and the last one, "don¬¥t mine with excavs" must be the dumbest one yet. But, funny thing is, I knew what you were gonna write way before you even did.
---
You know how? Because I already assumed you were ignorant, you just proved me right. If you werent, you would have responded with "Okey, maybe thats an issue and I dont know. There doesnt seem to be a counter to that specific issue". Because the answer is, there is no counter. But you choose to go full retard and double down.
---
And I honestly got better things to do than to deal with ignorant people. Someone else has to teach you shit.
---
Oh look, another "I should have an insurmountable advantage because I started playing before other people" post. 
---
Except you can log in too, you genuine dumb fuck. There is no advantage to anyone here, we all get the same amount of SP.
---
Unless the triangle bois are hurting you, in which case stay docked and miss out on that SP, but be quiet while you do it.
---
The blackout is a bone thrown at the dogs so they stop barking. CCP didn't change anything about the real problems that were there before the blackout : 
---
 \- Supercap umbrellas are still broken as fuck and are killing roaming in big bloc territories. 
---
\- Citadels are still everywhere and are a pain in the ass to grind.
---
\- No ressource depletion, which means big NS blocs can stack 30k people in a single fortress region and have no incentive to spread out on the map. 
---
So yeah, the blackout is kinda entertaining and i had fun for a week-end but is it long term solution? I don't think so. Adding a feature when your game is in a shitty state doesn't solve the underlying problems, it just divert the attention from them.
---
That'd require a double digit IQ tho
---
Im fine with blackout, just do it to everything like: jumps, rats killed, sov owner. Simply remake/boost exploration with removing too much intel to hunters and we are good.
---
With current cyno/cloak mechanics its just way too discourageing.
---
Another good idea tbh. And it's the latter. We could give a fuck about a worthless killmail. They just bot down the warzone.
---
uuh, you know that plex is just other ppl paying ccp, and even more than the subscription price? so... they are reducing the income streams \*and\* lowering the value of the income streams. i don't think that's a good argument for ccp to keep the change
---
If by chance this isn't bait, then no to all your questions,
---
Natural cynojam to all anomalies pls
---
Wormholes are dead because of no local? Don't make me laugh.
---
Wormholes are not dead. High class dried up a bit because of shitty server performance, fax cap booster meta and a certain goon pet alliance totally not blobbing‚Ñ¢ one of the most active c5 groups.
---
But lowclass is in a better place than ever with loads of smaller groups moving in.
---
Bye Felicia. Dangerous space means you have to work together to survive. If you can't do that while you krab, good riddance.
---
Im a noob that started playing just before the blackout hit (a month or so ago) so can share that perspective. I've lived solo in null the whole time (in Providence) so I do have some insight into this.
---
First of all, being out in space is much much more tense. Before, I would warp around without really caring because I could instantly see which systems were safe and which ones I needed to go around or find a different angle to warp to the Stargate with. This is probably the biggest difference I experience. With local, the anxiety feeling that you get from survival games just isn't there, but without it, you definitely start to feel it, which is imo a good thing. Nullsec should be paranoia inducing and should make you feel on edge. With local it didn't feel that different to hisec, now though when you make the trip out, it's a big deal to finally make it to hisec as you can finally relax.
---
I think the Intel systems can be refined and making the sensors and info acquisition in space more interesting would be a good thing. Limiting some of the info in these external apps would also be a good thing as they are kinda shitty and not that interesting to use currently.
---
Generally I'm very happy with the change as nullsec starts to feel the way it's portrayed as. Its certainly made more experience even more interesting and adds another element to eve that you need to learn and master - would be good if CCP made the mechanics of dscan and Intel gathering more interesting though..
---
Groups and players relying on lowsec cynos for JF's will protest this agressively.
---
Next on the list. With the realisation that upwell and capsuleer structures are taking over most actions. CONCORD are rethinking and refining their aproach on hostilities/interactions!
---
Lets go! Anything is possible!
---
&gt;  there is less out of ship experiences now than back in 09
---
How so? What has been removed?
---
&gt; The closest game to what you want here is no man's sky, not even kidding,
---
I'll check that out and see how much more appealing that game is.
---
You could just use real boots on the ground info, but that would require organization beyond the level of elite f1 pushers who hunt afks.
---
Eve never changes
---
How about no man's sky. I think that game has everything you want :). The multiplayer is about as good as eve. They don't have local. And you can walk on planets.
---
point 3 is wrong. and since you are probably not a pvper you havent realized
---
If memory serves me right between 09-12 there was at least a brief iteration of captains quarters, where you could walk around,  this has since been removed
---
Didn't they change how fleet warp works like two years ago?
---
&gt;People who post ideas here in most case don't think them though very thoroughly. 
---
Because they are people who want the easy kill, and not work to build up things. They are used to instant gratification.
---
No. This is too much PvP for the PvE zealots. They can't imagine a world where pure player content can generate the same or better outcome.
---
To everyone suggestiong No Man's Sky...
---
Haven't you guys ever see Elite: Dangerous?
---
It has all OP wants, and more. And it can be played perm. online and have interactions with other players.
---
It's a great game TBH
---
**Placeholders I know about:**  
---
Medium Observation Array (medium sensor station?)  
---
Large Observation Array (large sensor station?)  
---
Structure location communication array (local?)  
---
Structure stellar mapping array (autopilot?)  
---
Structure capsuller tracking array (players in system/region?)  
---
Structure scanner array (some sort of more powerful d-scan?)  
---
Structure listening post (Tap into coms?)  
---
Structure cloak pinpoint array (find cloaked ships?)
---
Came here expecting some bullshit about Peak Concurrent Users. 
---
Pleasantly surprised to be wrong.
---
&gt;"go back to the old days".
---
Of even more pathetic range of player retention.  We're at least near industry standards.
---
ok then fuck off idiot
---
Why would they remove such a cool feature?
---
Yes you can kill them sustainably because on top of being in your space with all the infrastructure to your advantage you also have spotless intel coverage for all constellations.  
---
 
---
Claiming that your crabs are defenceless is a nice touch, considering that they can try and actually fight instead of mimicking a possum as soon as they get tackled.
---
In general a harder and less safe game attracts less people, it's normal.
---
If eve is not yet dead is because there's null where a noob can grown in a community and be relatively safe.
---
Look at the forum or here, when some newbie asks where to go, what are the answers?
---
Horde, Brave, Test, Karma... Not wormhole or low sec or Eve University.
---
Look at the population of Eve, hisec and lowsec are starving of players, historical lowsec alliances disband, all null alliances grow up. 
---
Eve IS NOT a pve mmo, IS NOT a pvp mmo, Eve is a sandbox. 
---
Nullsec today is not safer than 10 years ago, the problem we have is an excessive proliferation in some aspects (capital, super, rorqual, citadels), but this has nothing to do with the rules of engagement of null or local. 
---
This problem came from injectors, and will continue until CCP will remove them.
---
Also remember that nullsec relative safety does not came from null itself, but from players that interact each other to make it safe.
---
A niche pvp game will be the death of Eve, it will be an insignificant hard game that no one will try anymore, and it will the the end of CCP
---
Because at the time players did not want development time 'wasted' on that, generally speaking its one of the more missed features that was axed
---
Since CCP was bought by Pearl Abyss, the comunication with the  community is dropping every month/year....
---
So you joined the game to play solo running from the bad guys, and now you are whining that you cannot solo pvp goons?
---
Sounds about right.
---
While it's not exactly precise language I believe Suitonia and HaliJones were refering to "the last few months" being the recent few months of this year where ratting has dropped off. By all means go ape shit on Suitonia for your own lack of reading comprehension.
---
&gt;The issue I see most here isn't a gameplay issue so much as a use-end issue.  Many, many button presses over any activity is going to make it tedious.  Mining in null? You're pressing d-scan constantly. Ratting in null? You're pressing d-scan constantly.  These low-input activities aren't enriched by this.  If anything it detracts from it because simply clicking to watch whether someone's spotted you isn't problematic, but having to press a button every 1.5 seconds is.
---
So how many toons can i train at the some time with MCT? 2 characters at once? or 3?
---
Changed one DDA on muh carrier to a Dmg control to adapt to this ‚Äòtweak‚Äô. Improvise, adapt, overcome?
---
Thank you, this sub is full of idiots. 
---
&gt;Less people have logged in, player count and subs are down
---
No! They're all bots, they don't count! 
---
&gt; An average number of supers have been killed
---
No! It's more than normal because I want to believe it is, even though the only interaction I've ever had with a super is gaze in awe while it handed me a one way ticket to my medical clone!
---
They just try to twist everything into a bullshit meme-spouting narrative.  People are already getting upvoted for claiming miners and ratters will be complaining about the skills event, when all you have to do is login? Why would they complain, the only thing I've seen is "hunters" crying that they're -10 and don't have a high sec alt.
---
PvE players complaining makes no sense if they actually think about it, but I guess repeatedly losing t3c's to titan gatecamps while trying to be a better hunter must lower IQ as well as SP.
---
Well said. No more "adapting" hopefully...
---
Honestly, stopped reading at the point where you argued that player logins are the one true metric of success. This is absolute balls for a whole heap of reasons, on which I can elaborate if you care to hear them.
---
It‚Äôs dangerous to assume that the Blackout is a one-stop, silver bullet solution. But it‚Äôs a statement of intent from CCP that they are prepared to mix things up to make this game fun and exciting.
---
So having perspective and assessing the results objectively, yes definitely. But stop being a moaning Minnie and suggest some changes for the greater good, rather than just focusing on what you don‚Äôt like (sorry, you might have thrown some in at the end, I just couldn‚Äôt plough on through your post!)
---
i'd be all for an extended period of deflationary economy. there is already heaps of ISK in the system. Aim for ISK sinks to be much higher than ISK faucets for a few years.
---
April MER
---
1300T in game
---
65T sinks per month
---
98T faucets per month
---
so if you set faucets (bounties and incursions mostly) to 10% of current values it would take 24 months to deplete the economy of ISK
---
No I mean like delve carried on as normal (I'd guess maybe test and brave space did as well to a point) whereas the rest of null had to either stop or change completely. The effect is that all smaller alliances will die and null would end up with 3 big blocs all blue to each other
---
Death to all supers.
---
Im all for having players return, however I feel eve wont be the game your after, try the suggestion here though they are all good options üòÅ
---
Rrrrreeeeeeeee
---
&gt; I can't even fight miners or ratters, let me bully literal new players : the post.
---
Be better OP. This is a stupid suggestion.
---
Laf.  I use them all the time because I'm lazy, and they can AFK salvage missions.
---
[Choo choo, all aboard the salt train.](https://youtu.be/3KquFZYi6L0)
---
So, instead of foaming at the mouth it's your turn to explain why my counters won't work.  
---
 If i am being ignorant for explaining my point of view (lmao), so are you right now by not even addressing my arguments.  
---
Case in point you claiming to know what i was gonna write before i had it even typed out. Come on dude.
---
The rorq bots for example will put out miner 2s if there is a hostile on grid or excavators if there isn't. If you cloak on grid with them they will pull the miners and put out the excavators again. Repeat ad naseum. 
---
I haven't tried talking in local with them to see what they do.
---
Mate most of the bots are not logged in its scary to see on the numbers how much of that was probably bots now there is no way to know for sure how much of it is bots and how much of it is players but by judging i dont see 6 billion vnis mainly humans i would say a lot.
---
Great and Rorqs are not going anywhere infact you'll see more of them since Rorqs are completely safe in the new changes along with supers..
---
Started reading, noticed it was stainguy. 
---
What if....we need more information
---
&gt;All the local change has done as far as delve is concerned is make the inhabitants drop on EVERYTHING lol
---
I beg to differ. All their rorqs have been ordered to switch to mining drones instead of excavators and it's hilarious. They've lost 150 excavators to bomb runs over the weekend, their current mining production is miserable. They've lost a vendetta to a DCPI dread bomb, and I even see less carrier/super ratting. They're not invulnerable.
---
IIRC, Spore isn't exactly multiplayer although other players' creatures and ships could get downloaded, and it hasn't been updated in like a decade.
---
I'd like something that gets updated on a regular basis.
---
From the perspective of a bloc, using plex as fuel is just one more thing to buy in Jita and ship in.
---
You're completely right about TZ coverage. Sucks to be a small group.
---
Killboards show the main effect of the blackout was to discourage the use of expensive mining drones - while thats a nerf to miner productivity, it does not solve the "rorqual problem" at all. There was a depressingly low number of supercap kills, meaning ratting supers can also operate under an umbrella.
---
On the other hand, battleship and below ratting is very, very dangerous in blackout - which means disposable myrmidons are going to get very popular. Or people just inject into a rorqual.
---
Sigh, I'm not sure theres a single region in nullsec i havent searched through in order to get fights, theres pleb krabs everywhere if i just want ganks even under super umbrellas, ive lost count of the amount of test supers and rorqs ive killed right by their staging. Point being when I want a fight where its not going to end up in me being dropped on by supers and being outblobbed me being able to chase them via intel or by physically seeing them leaving a system im jumping into means I can have fulfilling combat. As far as I can make out by your unwillingness to accept this I'm taking it that you are one of the risk averse gankers. You would like to be able to kill krabbers with no resistance and cheese your way to a nice kb. Instead under local you could stand your ground and fight the response gangs/fleets but thats too hard for you so every other playstyle must die to accomodate your playstyle.

I see people killing them in Rattles when I warp through invasion systems.
---
Yeah. Take your time though. Look at the data. Count the numbers. Recount. Take a nap, rest is important. Maybe a vacation, you guys are working hard. 
---
Then maybe get some more data. Can't play it safe enough. 
---
Been loving it dude, thanks for the hard work.
---
Thank you very much!
---
If you couldn't do that one jump that can make the route l significantly longer.
---
&gt; All the local change has done as far as delve is concerned is make the inhabitants drop on EVERYTHING lol
---
A corpmate in Signal Cartel said he had barley launched his probes before getting dropped and podded.
---
Note that SC is non-hostile.
---
I rejoice. According to the OP, nullsec has actually become dangerous. My irony meter is off the scale.
---
Sounds like supers/capitals need to be nerfed
---
how? you don't even know if they are blue
---
My personal observations for the blackout are that it has given opportunity for people to take out ships that they usually will just keep docked and roam around to search for some PVP action .However i have noticed that people are not risking very high value ships for that. Gate camps have increased which is not a bad thing it gives small roams a chance to clash there and have some fun. The blackout has also pushed people to work together as a teams rather than as individuals except for the solo PVP pilots out there. I do fleet and small gang PVP and i also do mining so one thing that blackout has exposed which was well known but not to the that extend i guess is that Black Ops ships + covert cynos are near to impossible to counter in a blackout setup. A PVPer would say well krabbers this krabbers that but if you look at it from a distance all a PVPer needs to prep is a ship that can fight and go out there and choose his targets and engage where he has the upper or equal hand. A successful mining op requires you to :
---
* Clear all wormholes in and around the system that you are going to mine
---
* Bubble up all gates both sides 
---
* Bubble up the belt you are in from each gate + the sun
---
* Deal with rats 
---
* Have alts on each gate to monitor gate fire
---
* Have scan inhibitors deployed (20mil each per hour)
---
Now the ISK investment into mining is way higher than an average PVP guy. Orca costs around a billion and each hulk is around 400k fitted. So you usually sit on the field with total ISK around 2-3 bil plus you have to have eyes on each gate. The PVP guys can sit on the map away from you and check if you mining or not without even sending a scout. Once they detect a system with mining op going on they send a Manticore which can very easily get trough the bubbles on the gate unharmed and cloak up. The moment you have that that system becomes unusable unless you decide to risk. That guy can stay there for days on end and you would not know if he is there or not. If he is a good pilot you will only see him enter the system and that will be it until he decides to drop you or jump out. So now the effort that the PVP guy did was just un-dock and gate to the target system and cloak up which killed the effort of around 6-7 other pilots(alts) with their whole setup. So lets say the miners decide we will risk it as we can not stop our only money influx (industry) and they go out and mine. The PVP guy tells his mates or logs his alts with BLOBS and gets them ready. He de-cloaks next to the miners and opens covert cyno... here come the BLOBS they tackle a hulk each and an orca and the pilot looses his mining fleet. There is nothing that can be done to counter this as the time it takes to take down a mining fleet VS time to setup a counter drop fleet is just too little unless you have prior intel that the dropper is coming.  So BLOBS just cloaks back up and they just need to wait for their timer to jump back out safe and sound.
---
Eve is a complex game and changing one thing has a knock on effect on other things. It is near impossible to predict how you will upset the balance elsewhere when you change something. At the current state with the current change i think its all positive except Blackops/covert cyno ships (which were broken before the change as well as they can cloak for hours on) and Industry has been hurt the most where people are scaling down to Procurers and Porpoises to minimize the losses if they get hit. 
---
Please give comments with suggestions on how to defend yourself as a Industry guy if you have any.
---
One of the reasons states don't go to war. But we want the reverse for EVE really, don't  we?
---
Does it matter?  Recall your drones, align out to one of your 15 athanors.
---
Another badpost by Stainguy go post about stain lowsec gate or whatever you do
---
who needs crabs in this game anyway

Faction warfare space is a good place to start. You don't need to join a FW militia to fight in FW space - in fact, not joining gives you the largest range of targets, as you can fight everyone without penalty other than to your security status. But joining a militia can be fun too. In a militia you can often find yourself involved in spontaneous small-gang PvP. That can happen as a pirate too, but you'll probably need to join a group that likes fighting in FW space. In any case, joining a corporation is a good idea. You'll be able to consult more experienced players and take part in fleet &amp; small-gang PvP instead of just solo. There are also NPSI groups, which are groups that organize fleets that anyone can partake in, which is another avenue to learning the ropes of fleet combat. The Eve Uni public classes and fleets are also more beginner-friendly ways to get into fleet PvP, and often come with a lecture on various aspects of fleet combat such as various fleet roles and d-scan. All of these can nowadays be accessed through the NPSI group discord; see https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/adbyho/new_spectre_discord/.
---
FW plex mechanics are ideal for finding small-scale fights in small ships (cruiser down). An excellent reference for understanding the fitting meta at the frigate level is https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/ahwsef/novice_frigates_yearbook_2019/. This guide is specialized for FW and does not 100% translate well to nullsec - namely, afterburners are more common in FW and less common in nullsec (because in FW, plexes are the primary location for combat, while in nullsec there are no plexes to dictate initial range and bubbles are a thing). But some principles and fits can carry over, or be adapted to nullsec. My suggestion would be to pick out a few frigates from this guide that you like and go looking for 1v1 fights in FW plexes.
---
A large part of becoming a competent solo pilot is learning matchups - what fights you can take, and what fights you must run from. No ship in EVE can fight everything (except maybe the Worm, which shits on basically everything that enters small plexes, please don't fly a Worm). Matchups are primarily decided on the ability to dictate range, combined with the DPS/tank comparison. Some of this you can glean from guides, others you'll just have to experience for yourself. Don't be afraid to take slightly suboptimal fights! You can learn something from every death.
---
Logistics for this can be done in a few ways. I personally set up shop and place my medical clone in a highsec regional market hub adjacent to FW lowsec. Putting your medical clone near your warzone has the benefit of letting you self-destruct your pod for quick travel back to your staging. You can take advantage of freeport citadels to switch out of your training clone so you don't lose implants when you pod. For Cal-Gal FW space, examples of such hubs are Ichoriya, Stacmon, Orvolle, and Villore (assuming my info isn't super outdated). Orvolle is additionally notable as a highsec entrance to Syndicate, so if you want to dabble in null you could set up shop there. These hubs are naturally less well-stocked than the main hubs, and there will be a bit of a markup on PvP related items, but it beats flying 9+ jumps from Jita or Dodixie to the warzone every time you lose your ship (which will be often). There is also some room for profit to be made by playing the market in these hubs. You can alleviate the logistics burden by paying haulers like Red Frog, or joining a group with a hauling program.
---
Lastly, to answer your question about gates: in lowsec, if you commit a suspect-level offense on a gate or station, then the gate and station guns will aggress you. The usual example of such an offense is shooting a non-valid target. Frigates and destroyers usually only have the EHP to tank a few seconds against gate guns, but you will usually have the time to warp off if you react fast enough. If you want to avoid this, then the only valid targets to shoot near a gate or station are: pilots with a suspect timer, pilots you are at war with, and pilots with a limited engagement timer with you (anyone who took an offensive action against you, whether aggressively or in response); shooting these is not a suspect-level offense and will not provoke the gate/station guns. This aspect of lowsec is safer than nullsec - nullsec gates do not shoot you. Understanding gate mechanics is vital to fighting in low and null; check out the EVE Uni page https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Introduction_to_PvP:_Gates to learn the details.

Hah. Cant help but think there was a polite way to word that Friend.

sooo..nothing has really changed. got it.

Make a character into the faction that is highest tier. Farm LP as much as you can and wait for the tier to start dropping. Switch side to the next higher tier faction. Farm LP. Convert LP to isk when it's value is high.
---
Spot on would upvote twice but can't.
---
Right...then you dock up every 5 minutes when a blue passes by, and aren't sure whether that loki you picked up is sitting cloaked waiting for you.
---
You're flat-out lying.

The titan that died was doing a drive-by against a rorqual.
---
welcome to the club :) solo can be ball breaking frustrating but it feels so good
---
You don't have to make assumptions about how i play just because we are in disagreement here.  
---
As i said above i am sad to see that your playstyle doesn't work anymore. This game needs a higher diversity of playstyles.  
---
But i've been roaming for the last year, and it is so hard to escalate fights properly because everyone has perfect intel all the time.  
---
I know the frustration of holding tackle on a VNI for 10 minutes just for the local guys to ignore it or them forming 20 caracals for our 2 frigates and a cruiser.  
---
I get bored with just ganking stuff too. I understand your frustration.  
---
But this shakeup is so badly needed and i think having more ganks can't be a negative because more ganks = higher chance of a good fight developing from it.  
---
With local ganks don't happen, so the natural escalation progression of a fight in eve is fucked from the start.
---
this is saaad. thank god for blackout. let's get those graphs closer together or better: switch places
---
It is not just a minor inconvenience. I cannot speak for the entire nullsec, but i have alot of experience in how it works in fade and deklein. And ALL those bots were local-based bots. They see a neutral entering system, they warp. They are additionally setup with d-scan for bubbles i assume, as when you drop a bubble in front of their citadel, they won't warp away anymore after undocking (they would simply dock again). 
---
But the bot-makers know exactly that d-scan means you see the ship when it's either on grid with you after uncloaking or in warp max 14,3 AU towards you, which limites the reaction timer to well until you're able to lock and point/scram the vni. And that is far less time, for a VNI to warp out, then the moment he sees you appearing in local. 
---
So for them it's a complete game changer and if you know how bots work and you set traps like bookmarking their sites or warpins, then the chance to kill them will go from "almost not possible" to "will get him for sure next turn"
---
there is lots you can try as Alpha. and its also possible to have several Alpha characters on separate accounts training concurrently. You can only play one of them at a time but it lets you try even more things out.
---
for example perhaps train exploration frigates on one, market trading on another, drone combat cruiser Vexor Navy Issue on one, and missle battleship Raven or Rattlesnake another.
---
also make sure you join some groups. Eve Uni in highsec, Pandemic Horde or one of the other newbie focused nullsec corps.
---
*shrug* Death to all supercaps.
---
You seem to live under the impression that stuff in Star Wars makes total sense, lol.
---
Lol that you think leadership gives enough shits to "order" miners not to use excavators.
---
the graph has been scaled by 200. remove that and you will see the dips more clearly
---
Except large communities have been there since the beginning and the only thing that changed is game mechanic that regulates the amount of effort to obtain "the goods". The game itself went from "biggest alliance spends a year to build a titan" to "lol, allready replaced".
---
It's not that modern empire builders are that much more civilized than BOBs were, it's the game itself became trivial.
---
Not sure what that last sentence is supposed to mean. But everything else you said isn't based on anything I've said.
---
Friendly reminder to you.
---
You're not owed free kills just by turning up. Get good you absolute scrub, ratters do not have any kind of advantage, unless they rat in a PvP bait ship. Which means they make less money. 
---
Plenty of people in this game can't afford to pay for a sub/all the ships they lose with real money every month, so rat towards the cost. Acting as though it's the wrong way to play this **sandbox** game is a low IQ viewpoint.
---
Imagine crying about local, and the moment that's removed, crying about warp stabs too.
---
Maybe 'ordered' is a strong word, but it was certainly suggested, and almost every single rorq we came across had mining drones out https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/478879583723192330/600423231941509121/unknown.png

&gt;Except large communities have been there since the beginning

Space is big enough, just because a Russia exists it doesn't mean Australia can't, or Fiji. There's loads of space that's not really used by people from Tribute to PB to Cloud Ring to Scalding Pass, etc.

---
i am gonna bite: BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAaa
---
He's right ... we did like 10 sites in the system we own two days ago. And compared, that the amount of NPC's we killed, were more then ALL other systems combined in the entire region, that we're living in.
---
Before the blackout, no matter when i came online, i had at least 3-4 people in space in almost all systems, killing thousands of npc's per day. So i agree there are humans, who might just not try to directly rat again, which is understandable as blackout day number one, basically whole eve community went into hunting mode ... so very likely, not the best time to do anything, but on the long term, they will figure out how to do sites here and there to keep up adm's and to get some money, or find new ways ... bots on the other hand, have to trick no local, and pressing d-scan ... is not enough, especially since there is a limitation how often you can press d ... a ceptor in warp to you, will get on top of you, especically if a bookmark was made last time the bot was in the same site ... take a recon? well you will basically only see the ship when it's almost on top of you ...

Hey there. Nice to read your tears, keep on coming. 
---
Regarding advantage. Ratters have all the advantage before hunters: intel chats, intel bots (not working since blackout, hope they won't work anymore as well), they can warp instantly as soon as they spot something on dscan. And I'm not mentioning that every ratter is protected rn with umbrellas. It was almost impossible to catch something unless you have blue eyes on it. 
---
Nullsec not meant to be safe as it were before the blackout.
---
Ty for your opinion.
---
May this year you fucking imbecile, l2read please before you kill us all from having to read your verbal diarrhea
---
It's a touch aggressive, but not stupid.  I play Eve mostly with friends, I really dislike playing solo and we all play other games together as well. 
---
When certain things get boring in eve, such as roaming null, we did other stuff in the game, group pve, abyssal stuff, high sec ganking, camping in wormholes, tried roaming new areas, rolled wormholes for new content, went off scanning and exploring. 
---
If there's one thing this stupid game does provide, it's a huge range of activities to do with your friends. 
---
Why has his friends quit? local going into delayed mode is a change yes, but far from an insurmountable one, Eve mechanics are constantly changing whether it's back end stuff like this, sov mechanics changes, wormhole spawn changes, ship and meta changes.
---
I posted in another comment somewhere that we have already lost ships to even basic precautions such as a miner with a scram, and ratters that weren't afk. Hell, most of the time over the last couple of days I've barely gone more than 3 jumps into a system before losing my ship to gatecamps or others
---
If the only thing keeping his friends from playing eve together as a group was almost complete safety whilst ratting, then I'd argue that they really don't care that much about the group or the game anyways. 
---
I could be wrong of course, but whats their plan should this last longer than a couple of weeks?
---
Good post my dude. +1 
---
Ive been playing since this started, and 6 months ago i got tired of adapting, tired of listening to people mine instead of coming for a roam. Tired of people defending bots, and perma caps online.
---
Blackout brought me back, its spooky, you dont know whos there and what they have, and, i love it. 
---
If it goes, people will say go to wormhole space, adapt.
---
Ill just say been there done that fuck off.
---
You know that the javelin torps exist right?
---
He and I were both referring to the drop off recently (AKA May 2019). Not May 2016, I think you got confused.
---
For sure people are adapting. I've seen far more gatecamps and faster response fleets, miners with scrams and non afk ratters in the last couple of days than I've seen in months.
---
I won't have a chance to lose at eve until it stabilizes.
---
see ya
---
Translation: Hahahaha come under our super cap umbrella because we refuse to do anything outside of it without intel channels facilitated by local.
---
Real talk though, blackout has been a blast, haven't seen this many toe to toe gud fites (read: subcaps) happen in NS in a long time.
---
No problem :) I'm actually a really nice person. You're literally the first person whose ever referred to me as a 'jackass' before. 
---
I've put a comment further below that further explains. Sorry if I hurt your feelings.
---
Confusion
---
The data in the graph does not include July (when blackout happened) since the month of July hasn't concluded yet.
---
Goddamnit stainguy
---
Donk Donk !
---
Keep your small gang gud fites to yourself thanks I play eve for block wars not factional warfare.
---
&gt;Hey there. Nice to read your tears, keep on coming. 
---
My tears? I'm not the one who made a salty thread because I can't catch anything.
---
&gt;Regarding advantage. Ratters have all the advantage before hunters: intel chats,
---
An Intel chat is part of the game. That's like saying a hunter has an advantage because he talks to the rest of his fleet while roaming/ if he needs backup.
---
&gt;intel bots (not working since blackout, hope they won't work anymore as well),
---
I'm not aware of anyone using intel bots. I'm sure they are a thing, but you cannot possibly believe most ratters utilise them?
---
&gt;they can warp instantly as soon as they spot something on dscan.
---
This is very ship dependant, some won't reach warp in time. And some ships can't be d scanned but will still easily kill low end ratting ships. So this isn't an advantage.
---
&gt;And I'm not mentioning that every ratter is protected rn with umbrellas
---
Why would you rat anywhere else? You'll just get jumped by a fleet, and unless you have a larger response fleet, you lose your ship. That or you have to stay docked and you can't make money. Feeding kills is not many peoples idea of a good time. 
---
&gt;It was almost impossible to catch something unless you have blue eyes on it
---
Imagine needing to have spies to catch anything lmao 
---
&gt;Nullsec not meant to be safe as it were before the blackout. Ty for your opinion.
---
I don't know where you were, but it wasn't particularly safe. But then it's not supposed to be a feeding ground for anyone who has a t3c either, so complaining about warp stabs is laughable.
---
No local means it goes from dudes branching out a bit further than the umbrellas and having a few subcaps come try to save them toeveryone staying under the umbrella and dropping supers on everything. I don't think that youre being very logical at all. Youre taking the placebo and thinking its great but its doing nothing good.
---
Ahhhh yes, the joys of tidi and pressing F1, such a blast.
---
&gt; the modules that drop will become insanely expensive.
---
So faction items that cost more than most ships hulls will become even more expensive? Who`s gonna pay for this exept whales?
---
I am enjoying it. 
---
You have to use your ships tools to find targets or evade attack rather than getting a helping hand from local. 
---
You also have to think about piloting and fitting to better protect yourself or enhance your ability to tackle your target.
---
It makes space feel more dangerous - rather than local being filled with 10-200 blues and the odd red, now you don‚Äôt see anyone other than those who appear on d-scan.
---
Clearly cloaky ships (if cloaked) and combat recons don‚Äôt show up on d-scan, but again these can be countered by your own cloaky eyes/good intel which breeds collaboration and with the right planning, a home field advantage. 
---
Pilots who pay attention and learn from mistakes will survive and thrive, pilots who just want to keep afk ratting, don‚Äôt use d-scan or take advantage of the homefield advantage (supercaps umbrella, intel networks e.t.c) and don‚Äôt modify their fits/habits accordingly will struggle.
---
It means everything to me. Those shakes , that buzz.
---
I want it, everyday. The first over and over.
---
It's only a 100km kill sphere should be at least 500km
---
"I guess everyone withput a super umbrela is fucked"
---
Are you high? This was the same before blackout buddy.
---
What a load of nonsense.
---
First there is zero evidence is just a few days that Blackout is bringing in lots of old and new pvpers whatsoever.  We here like 5 people on reddit say I'm going to resub, that doesnt mean we have a huge influx resubbing.
---
Secondly when you say 1000s of botters what's the evidence of that number? I dont think CCP has ever released an official number.  If its 1000s then that's really worrying.
---
However I agree because of blackout there will be less people ratting and less people mining.  Which I think and please feel free to counter argue but surely if there is less minerals and less stuff being built that's only going to drive up prices significantly.  I'm not sure that's a particularly good thing.  However I would like to see the prices specific to supers and caps and citadels building materials to be significantly increased and we may go back to 100b titan costs and 25bill super costs because damn at them being 10b in Delve.
---
And citadel proces are just so wrongly priced its untrue.
---
I think blackout needs to be indefinite to really make a difference and probably into low sec too. 
---
But I'll say it again what happens when the bots go and the ratters and miners stop because they constantly get ganked?  Because if it's pure pvp then blackout didnt make that happen we've always been able to form a fleet and shoot others.  whereas before others would form a fleet for good fights now the mind set is dock up because through the years we've move from a pvp focused game to a PVE focused game
---
We used to pvp all the time even with local that's has never stopped people pvping, the players stopped themselves.
---
Hopefully though this has a positive impact but it's much too early to see what that is..
---
bet you never hunted a bot in your life
---
1. Nullsec was the safest place to rat (especially if you are part of a big coalition like botswarm, legacy, etc). If you are not ignorant idiot it was impossible to catch you. 
---
2. Intel bots were used by every ratting group i've seen (maybe with exception for bigger coalitions)
---
It made impossible for me as a hunter to catch anything except using blue eyes or cloaky campers. 
---
If you cannot afford to loose your ratting ship get back into HS or LS and get some money.
---
Agree big blocs are less affected, you could say more caps are getting tackled but only marginally more are dying because of umbrella. I suppose subcaps do run more risk but eh..already replaced.
---
Lol ok
---
I had 3 omegas before blackout, main+super/carrier+fax. All subscription accounts, I only krab for pvp, having around 150 mil on my main and around 2 bil in loot that I need to gather and sell because I can't afford my svipuls anymore. On the super and fax alts I also had rorq/vni pilots that while i was pvp-in had them in space, getting isk. I only have my main now.
---
Many biases here. You weren't complaining when your side was ruining the game for all others in nullsec, and even in low and highsec BTW.
---
This rethoric always has been the only argument of the null blocs too : do as we want, or we will unsub en masses. For years now they were listened to. And the game was, according to everyone, on a bad trend.
---
That's what you are ignoring here BTW with your "objective measurement" of pcu. What is the value of a high pcu of bots and people spinning their ships or playing other games while waiting for content to be brought to them? What's the value of a high pcu if it' s only slowly declining?
---
Or to put it more harshly: what is the most toxic community of this game? The one of pirates and bloodthirsty and reckless pvpers or the one of carebears and empire builders priding themselves of forcing everyone else to play like they do?
---
And what's the problem of a low pcu count if it allows the game to recover the dynamic of old that brought it through all those years?
---
I'll just end this with the final irony touch ; your kind said this a lot when people complained about cap proliferation and the safety of nullsec: Adapt or Die.

:O a super kill in 2019 in eve OH WOW.
---
Much more to it than that if you bother to look into it.
---
The one thing I‚Äôve truly enjoyed, is seeing how badly the bots are broken now. I can come in clean a system out within 30 minutes because the repeatedly go back out after 1 vni is killed... also all these bots are clearly alphas being multi boxed by someone too all the same fits names and mechanics that are involved when killing them.... they are all fit for alpha accounts as well which is another scary thing that I hate to see and that is isk being pumped into the economy without even having to pay for a subscription.... and they do it day in and day out in Deklein, Fade, and Branch....  before the blackout you would see 8 -10 systems with constant VNIs ratting at least 18 hours a day with 5-10 VNIs.... and you could always tell it‚Äôs someone botting because we could time the exact warp our time to set a log in trap to catch them in bubbles when they warped back in.... however still took hours just to set it up to lower the interval on which to catch them.... 
---
However because of the blackout the systems and space you actually do see active are actual players... (given we‚Äôve still killed some bots that are trying to run even in the blackout). Which even though over all amount of systems is less active it is exciting to actually know what the true amount of players active is... It then truly shows how much room is available in null sec if large blocs can‚Äôt rent out space to botting groups who then pump isk into the bloc and economy.
---
I think the biggest problem is not allowing the test to go on long enough to get accurate statistics. If the test ends too early because of the loss of logins, then those who unsubbed or didn‚Äôt log in during the blackout to protest it,  successfully messed with the statistics of the test....
---
(Sorry for bad grammar it‚Äôs 5:30 am and don‚Äôt feel like fixing shit)
---
Sure bud. Sure.
---
I think when the new wormholes appeared, its automatically identify the exist and open k162 immediately, not have to wait until someone come and travel through it. So there is no definition about closing the holes and rat inside of it
---
This post üòÇ

Its a rare kind of creepy horror when you crab smashing dscan for some time only to realise it was set to KM instead of AU
---
after april most of us were severely burnt out on the game and a lot of people actually quit so
---
Can you tell why his slot layout is superior? Thanks for the long reply!
---
... and now consider: hunters have intel on where you live and do your pve. Open frontier isn‚Äôt it?
---
no local also hurts the smaller groups, no proper defense fleet, people will move to those groups who can defend their stuff. 
---
at what point in the empire building war game should your home space be less safe than low sec space, null sec only means that concord isn't policing the system not that it shouldn't be secured by the alliance that lives there.
---
What if CCP stops seeding datas (so dotlan/zkill wont show anything) for systems without this observatory array ... so at least smaller groups could hide between the big empires ?  
---
I agree this change leads to having the bigger empires getting even bigger, but no idea how local or no local could fix that. My hope is CCP goes further with the drifter invasions like doing an unstopable invasion burning regions down from time to time (killing all citadels etc.) so people have to move. Maybe that would stop big empires, on the other side goons would probably adapt to this too and make it all organized.
---
for it to be so, people gotta loose. including you, generally it doesnt work too well. even how chaotic and great and strong it sounds. in real sence, youd all hate it cos no one likes loosing
---
&gt;less people mining
---
&gt;However I would like to see the prices specific to supers and caps and citadels building materials to be significantly increased 
---
Yeah, the solominer with an industrial and some Barges is gonna downgrade to T1 or dock up, but I wouldn't really be scared more than before while flying a Rorq under a cap umbrella in Delve. 
---
As much as i hate this line of "this hurts the little guy more" gets memed out by goons daily, I have to agree with them here.
---
I shoot what i find. More than once i ended up bitting more than i can chew. XD
---
Have fun with your 4 friends shooting sleepers. Idiot.
---
ok cool ill be the prey that `won't shoot back` pls come attack me mister wormholer
---
I am part of an active ally in 0.0
---
I dont need so much money because i mainly do solo pvp and i m selling loot of the people that i kill to re-invest in pvp ship. Hopefully i have not lost my cap yet.
---
I have a lot of alt that are logged off in many system just to instant pvp (log on -&gt; Dscan -&gt; pew pew -&gt; logg off and repeat with other toon). Sometimes i just play Eve 5 min and i have 2 fight.
---
Yesterday it was the first time since i play (3 years) that i found nothing to kill in all the system that i camp (ofc i dont camp Tama üòù), 3 days after the blackout....

Check chat channel in eve, "Warp To Me Incursions". Plenty of folks will be willing to answer your questions. WTM is newbie friendly and has helped me make loads of isk where I couldn't before.

Because that's not fun. EVE is a game and it needs to be fun. There need to be 'gud fites,' not just curbstomps. Additionally, 'massively superior' only needs to be in numbers and resources currently, not tactics. There isn't a whole lot of strategy or thought behind yeeting capital ships at your opponents until they die.
---
I don't know everything about the current meta so I can't really say if these specific changes are good ideas. But I can say that the whole drop-caps-on-everything-that-moves concept is probably not fun for any party involved. The guys getting blobbed just die, and the blobbers just press F1. There isn't anything interesting going on there. It's probably not even a fight, just a mass deletion of red highlights on the overview. There do need to be some sorts of changes.
---
A snuff guy once told me how he is scamming super/titan buyers.
---
He has a fake third party post on the forums with hundreds of alts comfirming it's real and supers/titans listed in the sales forum for super cheap. When people approach him he'd do everything legit except wait for a moment to poke the buyer when the normal third partys were not online. Then he'd refer to his fake one so the sale can still happen quickly while the buyer was sitting in front of his force field watching at the super he is meaning to buy. Apparrently alot of people fell for it and his very first scam worked out while he didn't even own any caps, he just bought a small tower and set it up.
---
He also did it the other way around offering big money for caps listed for sale.
---
&gt;1. Nullsec was the safest place to rat (especially if you are part of a big coalition like botswarm, legacy, etc). If you are not ignorant idiot it was impossible to catch you. 
---
Cloaky camping was a thing. It was easy to log on in system, warp to an anom and find some mining vessels to kill. 
---
&gt;2. Intel bots were used by every ratting group i've seen (maybe with exception for bigger coalitions)
---
I've literally never seen an Intel bot being used. How do you know they were being used by all the ratting groups you've seen?? Unless they have it in their bio next to rat damage resists, I fail to see how you can access this information. 
---
&gt;If you cannot afford to loose your ratting ship get back into HS or LS and get some money.
---
No, I'll just upgrade to a super and volley fools like you off field. If you think warp stabs are bad how will you handle 25+ core strength and heavy fighters. I can afford to lose the ships I use to make money, I just have absolutely no desire to do so. You fail to understand that the purpose of ratting is generally to make money to pay a sub or afford more PvP ships. A better ratting/mining ship means less time grinding, more time playing explo or PvP. In terms of ratting ships, that comes with an increased ability to defend oneself. 
---
PvP itself usually does not bring in money. Unless you're hunting defenceless ships, and thus don't have to actually fight. 
---
People who just pay for a sub/buy Plex for ISK don't seem to understand this, and seem to have an irrational dislike for ratters and miners.
---
As a pvp'er in a null indy alliance, i'm still ambivalent about this.  Short term, it seems to be no problem at all, certainly makes null feel less safe...been saying for years that null is safer than high sec...now it feels less safe.  But, I also feel safer when exploring j-space, compared to null...because nobody knows you're there unless they make an effort.  I'm using DScan a lot more, usually only spam it when there're reds or neutrals in system, now I've got no idea who's there, and I've spent the weekend putting up tacticals on the gates along the paths to low sec and also on all gates and stations in my home (something I should've done years ago, but didn't really need to until now), upgraded some of my kit for more cloaky/stealthy operations AND our alliance is now doing BLOPS again....yeah!!  So; some of advantage and not much more effort, but I wonder how this will effect player interaction, esp over the long term...no local means less opportunity to communicate with other players who are not in your other comms channels....and that's a key part of playing this game....anywhere, high, low and null (spent probably 100hrs in j-space and never spoke to anyone, only ever saw a few ships on d-scan, which I hid from ofc).
---
I dunno if more caps are dying or not, I'd assume not due to increased risk less people undock them.
---
I have enjoyed the blackout but I do think something like that effects smaller alliances more, and I do think something should be done to discourage blocs getting too big. I think lots of smaller alliances neutral to each other is much better for the game than 3 large alliances blue to everyone but I do also realise that's just my opinion and view
---
Id imagine them starting to use ov based warpoffs triggered by cloaky alts At gates
---
I don't consider myself l33t, but I've shot a few hundred ships down in the past year or so. Used to be a total carebear before. I can't say I've ever said "time to hunt some iterons tonight", I go out to shoot and get shot where I have SOME chance of coming out on top. I don't need care bears to shoot, I need other adrenaline junkies.
---
I wana see agent missions in nullsec, station owners should be able to pay a monthly wage to an agent to have them come live in their station allowing players in the local to grab missions.

I've been approaching several groups with alts and all of them had that thing on ts/mumble with a siren when someone is approaching. ALL. OF. THEM.

1000's of less miners will make the price of ore go up making the ore you mine WAY more valuable (trit is up 50% BTW)
---
Sure, they do in like 5% of all highsec systems. If you have half a brain you stay clear of the traffic and you're fine.
---
great feedback , i assume you are one of those people that are unsubbing 37 accounts??
---
I play Project Discovery for ISK. 3m every 5 mins is nice when you can't do anything but wait.
---
But how many of the 29k Sunday log in's where bots? I'm willing to bet a hell of alot less than the previous Sunday.
---
How many of the 29k log in's on Sunday actually sent cold hard cash to CCP for the privilege of flying there space pixels? Again I would say alot more or at the very least the same as the previous week.
---
quality reply
---
That is the point. You have more ganked guys on HS than null. Something is wrong with that.
---
I think it might be this - https://puu.sh/DTrsC/faff8baf48.png

I think these aren't on the market, and were only trade-able via contracts. Had a quick look but couldn't see any.
---
[https://youtu.be/bDipNHosAcQ](https://youtu.be/bDipNHosAcQ)
---
If you want nerdgasm gameplay without any meaningful interaction what so ever you want Star Citizen.
---
Well, I agree with you. 
---
I am paying my accounts via PLEX ( I have only 2  accs ). So I am buying PLEX each month. It is mainly due to RL stuff first ( as I can not play every day and sometimes I can not play for more than 2-3 weeks in a row). So I value my time spent in this game.
---
And these days I must say I am happy that I am doing this PLEX each month and not subbed for longer time.  
---
Anyway I like solo PVP in a low sec but I like small roam PVP with my corp mates in null.   But to be able to do this activity I have to krab for one week like mad so I can pay for PLEX and on top of it to be able to buy some new ships for replacement. 
---
So for me that one week is hell and now it is double hell due to blackout as if I loose my PLEX ship I will not be able to play another month due to not so much ISK in my wallet.   And why I do not have so much ISK in my wallet? , well bcs I do not play 24/7 , not doing AFK ratting and mainly RL stuff first.   
---
So for me this blackout is more like forcing me to stop playing Eve not bcs I want to protest but bcs I can not afford to PLEX my accounts anymore.  
---
And yes I have quite a well-payed job and can pay via real money. But why ? If there is option in game to pay for game via in game currency why not use it ?  I can use those money on some other stuff for kids...
---
Thanks for this but can you explain why the 3 of the same mids is better than mixing 2x scan strength and 1x deviation? (The way I'm set up now)
---
Do scanner mods not suffer stacking penalties the way most mods do, or is the extra ~25 scan res just worth it regardless?
---
I for one was really enjoying being a carebear in null. But since the citadel expansion made carrier ratting better there has been nothing but shit coming from CCP towards people that want to actively pve in null.   
---
For me the breaking point is reached. Why play a game when the devs are out to destroy your playstyle.   
---
Sure the income in null was to high and the inflation was running high. But that has been happening for years now.  
---
Just knee-jerking it after doing hardly anything for years is not how you balance something.   
---
And now you have a stagnating game with a pissed off part of the community. All the people resubbing because of this won't stay for long when the hype dies down again. After everything is said and done with this blackout there will be less people playing the game and even more migration into larger power blocs.   
---
If this would have been made a permanent change with some structures to get a "different" local and there would have been a dev blog and player input this could have been something. Instead we get the knee-jerk that is supposed to revive the game. Also a 7 day warning is not enough in a game like this. People have subs running that don't want to play in that timeframe. Sure the game could change any time during your active sub. But in MMO dimensions one week is hardly enough to announce that a whole playstyle in the game will be cut for an indefinite time.   
---
CCP will see that people unsub. But their active subs during the timeframe should have seen a rise. Does somebody want to report higher numbers to their overlords? That is the only reason I can think of to force a change of this magnitude in such a short timeframe.
---
It's like you DID NOT READ my comment. nice downvoted for being illiterate.
---
Markets already getting more cutthroat as more people turn to that for ISK making. The 0.1 ISK game is crazy last few days.
---
i didn‚Äôt say no solo hauling, you just need to accept the risk associated with doing anything solo in and MMO focused around PvP and player interaction.  
---
Also let‚Äôs not forget that a hunter also has to make compromises on fits.  Want to warp fast enough to catch up with a small things, gotta fit hypers, want to catch anything with inherent WCS, got sacrifice another mid.  Need to make sure you can keep up with what you‚Äôve tackle, gotta sacrifice another low for a speed mod.  Need to yank something heavier than yourself, need to fit tank and sacrifice either speed or dig.
---
Just because your world revolves around hauling, doesn‚Äôt mean sacrifices aren‚Äôt made on their end to catch you.
---
Doing absolutely anything solo in this game carries a much much greater risk that playing with people.  Just because you don‚Äôt want to, doesn‚Äôt mean you should be able to do in with any degree of safety.  You already have the cloak trick which CCP has said they won‚Äôt remove, get good and use that
---
Moonwalking in a DST is appropriate. :)
---
There are a lot of people who are extremely risk averse while ratting. Lots of people won't shoot another player unless they have 3:1 odds.
---
I've thoroughly enjoyed the blackout. Its been great fun as a roamer, finding more targets and also not know if I'm about to be dunked by cloaked ships, not knowing how much the defender has in system etc, finding other roamers to fight against. I've loved it.
---
However if it was done long term then small alliances would die off, I'm certain of it. The big blocs will carry on almost as normal (not exactly like normal I know) and they would tear the smaller alliances apart, meaning we'd end up with 3 big blocs in null as the only entities left.
---
A big shakeup nerfs to happen in null and this has been a lot of fun and definitely been a wakeup call to some people, but something needs to be done to stop blocs building tall. Anomoly spawn should be lower to encourage people to spread out more within any given groups space. I would say citadels and engineering complexes should only be able to be anchored at planets (same way pos and aths have to be at moons) but it's too late for that now. A group shouldn't be punished for having good infrastructure and organisation but lots of smaller alliances neutral or hostile to each other is a lot better for the game than a couple of large blocs blue to each other
---
There is a mid-term consequence of the blackout that you are not considering: reduction of PvE activity in nullsec means increase of profitability of said activities everywhere, including most notably highsec.
---
PvE players tend to think about risk/reward, as one way to measure success in the game when not engaging in PvP or empire building might be the accumulation of assets and ship progression in whatever manner you set for yourself. There are PvE players in nullsec and w-space precisely because of the potential rewards, and their confidence that risk can be mitigated.
---
It is widely assumed that the majority of EVE players live in highsec and rarely if ever venture into nullsec or w-space. That is there is no reward that will persuade them to accept PvP losses. Many of these players would not engage in combat with another player, ever, no matter how many times they get ganked. For them a life of modest rewards in highsec was acceptable, but that balance was being disrupted by all the PvE activity in dangerous areas of space, which made highsec PvE extremely unrewarding.
---
I would bet that CCP reviewed their statistics and concluded that since a lot of highsec PvE-only players would not engage in PvP ever, mechanics such as low rewards or random war declarations, were only annoyances that just caused frustration without enticing them to go out and embrace PvP.
---
By increasing the risk level of nullsec so that it lives to its name, PvE players may eventually find that their activities become rewarded again in highsec, and the few intrepid ones that continue operating in nullsec under increased risk find that the purchasing power of their proportionately riskier activities becomes much higher.
---
I think this reshuffling will bring more PvE players to highsec, and turn nullsec into warlord space, instead of being governed by very large player empires. I for one welcome this.
---
The lower PCU is partly due to BOTS staying offline during the blackout.
---
I think r/evejobs might be where you want to look.
---
They don't though. Botters have just stopped for now, waiting to see what CCP do.
---
&gt;He is literally telling you how people are changing behaviour
---
And I'm telling you it far too early to actually say how people adapt. It's been something like 3 days ffs! That's why there's testing phase that will last longer than a weekend.
---
"But the other guy says it is so! He is of the same opinion as I am so he MUST be right!!1!!!"
---
Please. I know this is reddit but you could at least try to think for yourself, spodbrainy.
---
Good point - I wonder if the botters will be more active in the markets now?  They already drive my crazy and are fairly easy to spot
---
I fit the above description, however I pved to fund pvp foe alliance ops. I do not like this blackout one bit, in fact I have felt less inclined to login at all.
---
I put a lot of time and effort into skilling into a Rorqual, and I am just a one man Rorqual miner with a pvp main. Over the past couple of years it's been nerf after nerf after nerf after nerf to industrialists, and CCP have finally pushed me over the edge with this local blackout..
---
If this blackout gets implemented permanently, I will nerf CCP's bank balance slightly by unsubbing my two paid for with real money accounts and go find another game to spend my money on, as Eve is no longer enjoyable for me.
---
All the good riddance people can piss off too, I'll have the last laugh when indy guys like me leave and you have nothing left to gank. And nobody can have my stuff either.
---
What do you think about wormholes? We've been living without local chat forever, and we're all smaller sized groups.
---
Ewwwww gross
---
eh, looking at VNI deaths they sure didn't stop logging in
---
I know local will be coming back but If local HAS to exist, it should truly be delayed in all areas of space (including empire).
---
Give a timer to all pilots at session change. For five minutes after entering, you can not read or write to local. You are hidden but you'll need to rely on probes or dscan for that time. After five minutes (or other appropriate time), you write to (appear in) local but are now able to read local for other pilots who have timed out.
---
If you move through a system before expiration, you neither read local or appear in it at all.
---
The blindness is temporary but goes in both directions.
---
that's the "change your gameplay" part.
---
Flair checks out at least
---
stop fuckin crying and go run missons in low. local whiner.
---
&gt; luckily there is a top management who decides
---
lmao if only
---
How do you know they are bots? If VNI losses don't spike after this change I'll be surprised. Botters weren't dying before anyway.
---
Short term maybe. Perhaps someone came to widen his/her horizon.
---
This is my point. People are not pvping because of blackout they are purely looking for easy indy and bot ganks.  The actual pvp is a by product of bumping into each other on a gate by accident.
---
What happens when all the bots, ratters and miners stop logging in or significantly reduce play time..??
---
  people.are talking about upwell structures to bring back local so the  what that does is just keep everyone under an umbrella where no one ventures out I'm not sure that's good either.
---
this graph show who dont like blackout. npc killers who cant pvp.
---
The reality is, content has gone down.  We are squashing small groups and denying them any good fights.  Discord is silent with 1/4 of the pings.  I have went on a couple of fleets.  It was boring.  We just waited around longer while the FC team collected intel.  
---
The PVPers who rushed back for the instant gratification they are addicted too will also leave just as fast for the next high...
---
Well not me, but lower numbers translate to less whales i can kill.
---
That's the lifeblood of Eve right there. Upvoted for having a pair of balls
---
Excuse me officer is that a B-type EANM on a faction super?
---
If CCP decide that a region will be burned down by NPC without any incentive or way players can reasonably fight them - it is the dumbest thing that can be done.
---
2 highs for cloak and scanner, no useless third like Buzzard
---
5mids for propmod, relic and 3x scanning upgrades
---
3 lows for whatever
---
Astero is a Pirate faction frig so you don't have as much rigging space as normal vessels have, also you lack scanstrengh since its 12,5% weaker compares to full T2 boni and still about 2,5% weaker even with skills only on level4! Add to that that you only have like 4midslots you lack a lot of scanstrengh!
---
Buzzards or other scanner vessels have the problem that they lack cpu and powergrid, so fitting a MWD and other stuff is NOT going to happen without implants so ... gg! For that reason I really dislike the Buzzard tbh.
---
Your traveltime between containers is really important so having the T2 MWD and some lowslot propulsion / agility upgrades are really cool! Often times you have to travel 70km from warp in to the container and about 30km inbetween them. With a Helios you get that done perfectly in two or one MWD cycle so you decelerate automatically after one cycle. With Astero or other ships you over or undershoot a lot and slingshot around - thats just something I find annoying, i know you can manually decelerate!
---
But why scanning you want to get the fuck out of the site asap so traveltime inside the site is a factor and traveling cloaked when you allready showed yourself at one container is a big nono!
---
If they don't pull drones fast enough you can kill them. 
---
You can bubble them on field. 
---
Botting Rorqs are incredibly vulnerable.
---
https://tagn.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/evenewplayertrajectory.jpg
---
CCP's own graph from 2014 Fanfest.
---
As you can see, up to 80% of all EVE players are not affected by the Blackout. At all. Hell, most of them probably don't even know it happened.
---
Well fuqing said.
---
except that still wildly favors roaming pvpers and hunters
---
a RamJag has 1 web maybe. not 2. if you are drive by scraming make sure your velocity vector is not aligned to the RamJag's vector. In a proper Ceptor fit and with different velocity vectors and with superior scram range you should coast out of the RamJag's scram and web range easily. Even if you get proper tackled by the RamJag you locking him down should get your gang enough time to kill him. Make sure to communicate properly with your gang so your rapid rapid light jesus ships are in range when you dive in.
---
Well i only described it for fade ... other regions, who knows. Guess there are a lot of bots who didn't get the message, or are still way too ISK positive and don't care ...
---
keep toeing the line buddy
---
bro you've made 6 threads about it and none of them are popular give up
---
Of course there are dips.  I'm talking about the trend across the whole graph.
---
&gt; I wouldn't really be scared more than before while flying a Rorq under a cap umbrella
---
they been ordered to stop using excavators and only use T2 mining drones.
---
fewer bots = fewer numbers
---
You won't "adapt" if you're not playing the game.
---
The thing is WH is for autistic dudes..no average player has got time or the will to do all that shit on a daily basis üòÅ
---
Yea 1000 titans per keepstar makes no sense, but then needing 1000 titans to defend your space makes no sense either rather just delete all the titans :D in one big massive brawl.
---
No Nullsec doesn't need to be riskier especially for us big guys 
---
Until people learn how to organize their members and actually put in the hard work we did fuck these changes they should just adapt
---
So, be in goons or forget about owning a titan because you will have nowhere to dock it?
---
&gt;Not at all what a real human would do, real humans just sit and wait for the cyno to go up and die in a ball of fire.
---
Remember, this is the community that actually considers "risk averse" an *insult*.
---
So your sarcasm might be lost on them.
---
If /r/eve was a popularity contest then you would be this old lady that no one ever visit.            
---
You know well that i don't rat, but mostly look for stuff we can kill.        
---
Jita was &lt;1200 people yesterday when it at the same time reach sometimes 2k - just to give you some idea about what issues i am talking about.
---
How is an invulnerable titan orbiting a planet risky? Its basically a large collidable object whenever not in use.
---
ok
---
Agreed, if he has dual webs he's not well tanked. Be careful not to engage too far from your gang, jags don't put out much dps no matter how you fit them. Tackle him well and let the gang sort him out.
---
Depending on your GPU, you might be hitting 100% GPU use in these cases.
---
My 2070 will hit 100% will 3 clients using these settings.
---
They have a kinetic hole, and very high em/thermal resists. While your interceptor likely doesn't have any weapons, your buddies can have some hornets (the damage dealing ones, not ecm) in their drone bay, or of they're using projectiles/missiles switch to fusion/titanium sabot or scourge respectively.
---
You just have to do a bit of a coordinated strike with your buddies, you know?
---
Also, I have the greatest respect for what the imperium have accomplished since the casino war
---
Yes.       
---
If you want to PVE go to big blob and rat.      
---
Why do you think so many WH people have ratting alts in delve ?
---
&gt;but I think it could spice up the game.
---
i love how consistently this phrase acts as a red flag for god awful ideas
---
Lets be honest if nullsec players don't login higsec alts to do stuff - it is bad ... for us.      
---
This is what i see since the Blackout started.
---
Actually the old NS PVP was mostly looking to gank miners or bots.  Now ya'll actually need to fight or worry about traps and its awesome.
---
Dock it in orbit around a planet... Im sure you've seen those before
---
Yeah sometimes you have to wake up at stupid hours of the morning to be a cog in &lt;insert egomaniac of the week here&gt;'s machine.
---
Dont make him break out his teacup
---
Fuck poe and his law tbh.
---
&gt;it is just your smoothbrain trying to find a trend.
---
Did he kill your Garmur with his Kestrel or was it something else that rustled your jimmies?
---
&gt;Do Line 1 - Line 2 if you want your trend.
---
That's what he did though, hence his comment regarding PVE kills no longer having any correlation with PVP kills from May 2016 onwards.
---
&gt;disassociation of PVE and PVP kills has way more to do with multi-account proliferation than anything else
---
He didn't even give any possible reason for that disassociation, but go on and correct him.
---
A rageboner seems to negatively impact reading comprehension, colour me surprised.
---
So people moved from shooting npcs in high to null, and overall there's less jumps and ship kills everywhere.
---
Yeah i dont like it too ... but what sense does it make to do some NPC Invasion where the big blocs can through there 1000 people or Supers on it ... that would lead again to bigger empires.  
---
On the other site, the big empires deserve what they build up ... so I guess thats the way it should go.
---
If you look in corp you will notice a number of other people are there. Maybe they could help lessen the load on the individual? Naw that's crazy talk...
---
Maybe CCP has understood that 29.000 players are more desirable than 27.000 players and 3.000 bots long term.    
---
It's not like they have a plan B if EVE were to be shut down.
---
None of which I implied. I just meant that a lot of people were concerned with stats (similar to what Suitonia posted today) and everyone hoped that this would get people out and about.
---
The blackout was pretty bad for the alliance i'm with, since a larger entity moved in right next door to ruin our playstyle. But shit happens. Move on.
---
Eh no it wasnt at all.  NS PVP was 50-100 man roaming gangs... firstly nano gangs then rr bs then zealots/hacs then t3s
---
Four blocs. Goons, Legacy, Horde and Frat.
---
And the blocs can very, very easily move their super umbrella in a coordinated way.
---
I mean.... let the null bears get over their baby tantrums and embrace all the older players I know that have resubbed. This had to happen. Of the 20 odd people small-gang people I used to play with I was the only one of our original group left, but some have come back for this.
---
Bring the chaos.
---
Alternatively force a mechanic where capitals can't bunch up in the same 10m area. They need space. They're big fuckoff ships afterall.
---
Having high Scanstrengh is usually the best. You have to at least scan with a decent strengh to even unlock the site to begin with.
---
Having higher power opens up sites way faster and below you even need to pinpoint them can look up whats inside. 25 scanstrengh are really worth it, also its best to arrange your probes in a cube formation to get some extra % resolution.
---
Spice up as in : would make a nice trophy case... Display your power to all who stumbles into your space...
---
No local, d-scan shows 8 titans on scan... You shit yourself because you don't know if they are logged in or not... Decide not to fuck with these guys...
---
"When people started complaining about nullsec being too safe, and getting dropped on by carriers becoming more and more commonplace"
---
"I moved to a small nullsec corp mainly focused on pvp for a while, life was good until bigger groups needed our space for renters, I got told to adapt."
---
I've actually only ever used 2 injectors right after I bought my first titan. Needed to train up one of the doomsday skills in a hurry. Still feel dirty about that from a year ago. I have an army of alts, but i dont farm them for sp. So fuck you good sir.
---
Inspired by u/suitonia I just grabbed the annual totals posting on Dotlan stats and dumped it into a tool to take a look.  The impact of the Citadel expansion to low sec seem to correlate with popular opinion.  Strangely ratting or traffic doesn't seem to have been a driving factor for low activity at all (passive moons eh?)
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Ratting and kills have been trending up, however this seems to be tailing off over the last few years.  
---
I can't go too deep on this given the dataset available and it's format.  If I can find a reliable source with more detail I can take a look.  Just thought I'd share with you.
---
TBH the smaller corps that would want to be in the outskirts of null would probobly use WH more then JF seeing as the risk is lower for most supplies they need. i havent played eve much since they started doing stupid shit to nerf alpha accounts. they seem to be milking the game already so i dont have much faith in eve anymore XD
---
yup p much
---
guess why?
---
Highsec is dying.
---
what
---
bro you're literally delusional, jita hasn't hit 2k in a long time and AVERAGES 1200 since 3 months ago
---
try and fucking login every once in a while and stop spouting nonsense
---
Enlighten me.
---
You have to be kidding, even the general bulk data? I can understand seeing which wormholes are super active being too much intel, but sum of all of w space seems reasonable. Be nice if w space was calling the kettle black if you know what i mean.
---
game became shit around late 2015/early 2016
---
first sentence is completely out of context. the second has nothing to do with soloing goons.
---
Ah yes, the anecdotal "bot regions" and "non-bot regions". Nice data, mate.
---
`With local you could still bot`
---
I've been thinking about this. If there is a reward for PvP, base it on the value of the kill. Make the LP or reward worth less than the value of the loss. That way it wouldn't make sense to farm blues.
---
I've always thought there should be a PvP reward mechanic, there are ways around farming blues.
---
highsec has felt the worst brunt of the falling playerbase since 2013/2014, it's gotten so bad individual gankers can out-fish the entire population of certain types of fish.
---
I doubt u pay for accounts with real money
---
People moved from Highsec to Nullsec because it became safer.
---
The simple answer: more content for all those elite pvp players.
---
Lesser intel on all sides forces the people to play together.. for me definitely one of the best part. You stop living alongside each other and start playing the game as group. That is what happened to krabs. this could help plex-pilots to defend each other better and to integrate newbros faster in a corp. To get each other known and maybe form more militia fleets. That is my point why it could be a good change. I talked last month to some new guys in null who left FW because it was not much better than ratting. you played solo, you fight a hunter, you get ganked.
---
So lets change at least one aspect that could affect all the others.
---
The problem with eve is the fact it went pro care bear and lost its core pvpers. They tried to go mainstream in hopes of getting 100k if not more players online. It didn‚Äôt work because the game isn‚Äôt designed like that. Example, you can take a F1 car and jump sand duns, or rally race. Nor can they compete where the F1 excels at. The game devs tried  to force a play style and failed miserably. By doing this, they imagined huge battles with numerous players online duking it out on multiple fronts. The wanted the most destructive yet easily replaceable eve ever. They made it possible for players to quickly get skills so they can accelerate themselves into capitals.
---
Reality, majority of people blued themselves and krab hard. Some were beaten into submission while other struggled to hang on what they got. Outside of those battles, the game is stagnant AF. Nullsec has received so many buffs when it comes to income (10/10 escalation, rorq mining, ore site repawning, etc) that it out does WH. Which by design is suppose to be more lucrative. Everyone is shiting out end game ships and their is no counter other than getting more end game ships than them. Yet when ones person industry power is 70k times more powerful than their enemies. You get a server that hurling towards the same faith as the chinese server. 
---
I can write a book here, let me try to sum things up. The game needs to go back at whats its designed for. That design is to be centered around pvp. Bhaals, mach, vindis, nightmares shouldn‚Äôt be in the abundance they are now, nor should the spam rate of capitals. The fact that it‚Äôs hard to mine is great. It‚Äôs slowing down the resources which will hopefully remove high resource items for being spammed on grid. Its removing highend modules from the game and slowing down faction BS availability. This will force cheaper doctrines. Example, when plex cost 350mil and a mach hull was over a bil, only certain groups dared to fly a fleet of machs into battle. That‚Äôs what the game is missing. All the spam of end game is cancer. Everyone is on the same playing field. There is no skills, just f1 and n+1. Thats not what eve use to be about (see rooks and kings) High availability of the rarest items in game is not good. It was a fuck up years ago that should have been patched. Fact is it wasn‚Äôt and this fix is effectively working at fixing the game.
---
You‚Äôre right and wrong about WH connection to null. Yes they did increase it but also significantly increased the change of it being a frig hole. They also reduced that chance of a WH spawning near the same system. Along with WH ratting nerf, null outshines WH. 
---
Brb work (30mins to text this)
---
Give all sleepers scrams, increase c5 spawn rate, reduce time to despawn, increase payouts but 16%, remove t3 skillpoint loss, add that to supers, give wormholes more variabilty im time to despawn, increase rate of roaming holes, add a stealth version of combat probes with very shitty scan strength, add mass to the leshak or bring all other BS inline. That should make the universe more balanced.
---
...and CCP does nothing. I got some in my market and just can't compete. I can update prices for 2-3h per day, 4-5 times per hour, but every timezone, every item I just drop price, 30-40 sec later I get 0.01 isked by the same 2 characters. Reported and CCP ignores. Frustrating.
---
You know that  ‚ÄúMost‚Äù of null is small gangs roaming around.   Only a handful of groups actually fit 100+ person hac doctrine fleets
---
I for one am not really sure whether I like it at all yet, and I rather hope it's not permanent.
---
Abyss bots are starting to become pretty common as well as more mining bots in high sec again.
---
Neither of these hurts eve as much as anom bots because no isk creation but yeah botter will bot.
---
I just want reliable 1v1 against people who aren't multiboxing or have billion-dollar clones. QQ
---
&gt; Abyss bots are starting to become pretty common as well as more mining bots in high sec again.
---
they were prevalent day 1
---
I for one am happy to see CCP moving back towards their roots. They even have a message for guys like you who are tempted to quit because eve can be harsh: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgvM7av1o1Q
---
And you don't get to fight us :)
---
Play the long game and get out of the .01 isk game.  Way more profit
---
We can only draw that conclusion if we overlay average active character stats for the same period.  I don't think we have it?

Who are you again?
---
I wanna disagree, but I'm certainly not enjoying it more now than I did in 2013 or so.
---
U think the crabs paying  with  real money?I doubt...ccp need players buying the plexes with real money...dont u wonder why  plex prices skyrocketed?
---
I think the biggest question for almost everyone is if it's worth to adapt, because it might be permanent, or if it's better to just wait, because it might not be. I think there's a lot of people in the wings who are waiting to see how it plays out to decide where to put their efforts.

Or or just don‚Äôt dock it like the 10+ years before keepstars

PREACH BROTHER.

Nullsec offered more safety and more reward than Highsec did once the mega-coalitions and new player branches of nullsec corps formed (2015 marks the birth date of Karmafleet and Pandemic Horde) so people decided to make the switch. The primary way to make ISK in highsec was from Incursions (require you to move every few days) and missions usually making you go 1j back and forth every other mission or so. While nullsec farming is often done in the same system day after day.
---
&gt;But does it dies by frigates only fleet?            
---
Bomber fleets, AF fleets &lt;- this is easy mode, but yes they are dying to what people are flying.            
---
If BomberBar muster up all people the 200ppl in bombers they get can kill a super &lt;5min (much faster if this is a ratting fit).
---
Stop talking to the mirror
---
This fucks the wormhole brawl meta where Blap dreads are super important...
---
Looks that way!
---
The days of off grid orca boosts and mining fleets in the belts and production POS allowed rather small entities to operate.     
---
While I commend the idea to put boosts on grid, too (especially combat boosts) that change alone made mining in everything other than big groups not worthwhile.       
---
The ridiculous mining yield of rorqs combined with injectors led to the death spiral of the economy as well as the cap/super profilition to the extent we have now.         
---
If rorqs had stayed affordable boosters (maybe unsieged?) for every size of groups while providing boosts to barges on grid we weren't nearly in as bad a spot.       
---
And I still think that is the way to go going forward. We won't see CCP deleting thousands of titans, but we have to stop the machine at some point.
---
CCP only loses $ with bots. It's a common misunderstanding that RMT supports plex sales, when in reality it's the opposite.
---
&gt; Pvpers who buy plex with rl money from ccp are worth muuuuuch much more as customers. Shedding 10 krabs for 1 such plex buyer is a good financial move for ccp
---
this is just stupid, all accounts are subbed for the same influx of money to CCP, they would likely rather have 10 paying account than 1
---
I am more concerned about the effect the lack of local will have on plex price. If removal of bots stops inflation and causes me to pay less for subscription, then by all means keep PCU low.

In eve capitals are just bigger subcaps - and this is the issue.
---
just spent a few hours in nullsec and didn't find a single fight ...u must be a bad hunter
---
Erm you know that they are now bigger alliances and bigger coalitions then ever before. Before there was max 2000 people in an alliance and that was big.   Now they are 35,000, 20,000 etc
---
There is nothing stopping any alliance especially now forming even a 50 man roaming gangs
---
Panfam
---
Winter
---
Imperium
---

---
All mega coalitions with big alliances and corps too.
---
I agree, but it‚Äôs better to adapt and make profit then be late to the party. 
---
I did Invest about 300b pre blackout on t3s and recons and already flipped it.  I am looking at putting another 500b into deadspace mods this week based on my predictions
---
&gt; I have always found it amusing that you could dock 1000 titans in ONE Keepstar...
---
What I similarly find amusing that there is enough storage space in Jita 4-4 for all the stuff being sold there. There should be a physically reasonable m^3 limit per station.
---
I know market people is going to downvote this into oblivion, but I think it could spice up the game.
---
/s
---
Just because I've played forever doesn't mean im good at this game. I lost 11 straight 1v1s two nights ago and that was on a 160 mil sp toon. 6 of those fights were against a 2 year old player.  
---
I could log in and get the sp, sure. Ccp also put this event suspiciously close to an event i dont particularly support. So I'm not going to help inflate thier log in stats. I'd also usually drop a few hundred dollars on promotions like the one they're running. Not doing that either. 
---
I'm not happy about the local changes they made what so ever so im not going to be quite about it. I'm entitled to my opinion as are you. 
---
These sp are carrots at the end of a stick to make ccp look good after they crashed their inflated log in stats by destroying the ability of bots to function. I'm actually really happy about them finally doing something about bots, but i don't agree with how they did it as it had a negative impact on human players as well.
---
I hear and understand your complaints, I just don't care.
---
Very true
---
Not even mentioning most of the botfarms went offlines is showing something. For the rest of thw game there is no difference between your afk krab setup and a bot setup. Personally i d say good ridance bots and massive krabs had it too easy for too long and both contributed very negatively to the game.
---
Admittedly, that's easier for the market mogul than the guy who was running sites in a super. But for the sort of person who could only do VNIs or whatnot, it's a bigger cost of entry that might not be worth the effort in the long run to adapt early.
---
The fuck-you button is, was and will be the cyno. Either you have the ability to drop carriers and so on on small gangs, or you can't maintain your space.
---
And the blocs still have the near-unbeatable super-blobs, as you'll find out if you actually roam in there space.
---
Basically, the Blackout was a sugar hit for small gang types, but if you check zkill, you'll see Eve players lie, and statistics don't.
---
The backbone of any modern nullsec group is it's rorquals and ratting supers, and the blackout did three fifths of fuck all to kill off either.
---
i fucking love it so far, its fun in every situation, traveling is dangerous, combat is spontaneous and fun, and you dont have to scan down chains for all of this either
---
I don't fit the above description, i pved to fund all sorts of stuff. I like blackout a lot, in fact i can't wait to get back home and login.
---
I put a lot of time and effort into skilling into a Rorqual long before it got panic, excavators and crazy tank. Over the past couple of years it's been nerf after nerf after nerf, but i kept thinking of new ways to kill stuff and CCP have finally pushed me over the edge with free supers, virtually unkillable miners and endless hordes of bots.
---
I've allready replaced your 2 accounts by resubbing my 2 accounts with real money because that's how i've been paying for the game since i was 15.
---
If indy guys like you leave i'll think about resubbing my rorq alt and we'll see who ganks who.
---
&gt; They stuck it out and dealt with it. If you want to keep playing the game, you're going to need to deal with this new challenge, just like they did.
---
so cry constantly on reddit ? got it
---
Stop posting before you've trained it to I, you're embarrassing yourself.
---
I said it's not the most important metric.
---
Just in period basis are -100 vni/domi botters, not to mention 5-6 groups smart bombing24/7
---
&gt; Except mining vessels, as per my earlier example, will be easy to catch
---
Not really, aside from rorqual.
---
Mining barges and exhumers can still align.
---
If it continues on a downward trend for 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, yeah I'll at least admit I'm wrong. But soe people aren't playing in the hopes that by the time they come back it's gone. So... no, less than a week is statistically insignificant. As is a full week. 2 weeks is questionable, 3 weeks is stable, 4 weeks is a good solid indication
---
Your point?
---
Just because someone doesn't play right now doesn't mean they won't play in a week.
---
Some killed a ship of mine, so I put a spy in their alliance, arranged to have their high sec miners ganked, led their friends into a wormhole so my corp could kill them, and then camped their home for weeks, occasionally killing their industrial ships. Once I felt they had suffered almost enough, I went to their alliance leader and told him to either kick them out or give me a ransom - he kicked them. Then I told them to pay me, move out of their hole, or give me a gudfight. They agreed to a fight(!!), but then backed out last minute, so I used my spy to get my corp into their hole at an opportune moment and wiped their fleet, then camped them for a few more weeks. I gave them one more chance, and they finally took a fight where I insisted that they used their prized ships and we killed them all. Having regained their honor, I didn‚Äôt bother them more, but their corp effectively collapsed and they moved out shortly after to join some shitting null alliance... which I guess is better than sitting in a C2 w just a high sec where all you do is mine and run your home sites in a fleet of 3 snakes...
---
Yup, until crius expansion I was one of those high sec miners.
---
Yup, player engagement is more important than concurrent users.
---
Focusing only on concurrent users would be the short sighted attempt
---
How about fighting back?want that juicy mongoo/ore?Fight for it
---
And thus the haw titan nerf.
---
It's one of my hobbies. It's relaxing for me, or was until blackout and drifters. I make decent money, so why not?
---
Screen shot from my real life budget for reference.

Well, one thing is clearly an easy take-away:
---
Highsec is the most important part of Eve. The most PCUs were achieved when highsec had proportionally the biggest community. And it's great that CCP realized that and supports Highsec again further
---
like so many things that sounds nice, they get announced, people cheer on it and then ccp sweeps it under the rug      
---
^Logi ^on ^killmails
---
I played for years, Have enough saved up to play for years, and just cannot be bothered to sign on any more.
---
The game has become stagnant, all new activities such as the abyss, have all had some mechanic built in that simply kills the fun, because CCP are desperate to limit the income because Null income has been so vast that anything significant in addition would push the game over the edge.
---
so their only response available appears to be add risk, to prevent all but the most dedicated thrill seekers to stick with it. All of the traditional income sources are now like collecting pennies from the pavement.
---
This cannot change until null produces balanced income in line with other areas of space.
---
so CCP are apparently using the same tool (increase risk) that doesn't work elsewhere without reducing player engagement.
---
Now there is the effect of making bot farming uneconomic, but as computer time is cheap, how efficient and effective that will be is open to question, but the drop in PCU seems to indicate it is having an effect?
---
I used to love EVE and considered it the last game I would ever play, hopefully this might fix it or make a start, but I doubt it, and I am sorry that it's your term to suffer from the risk reward hammer, I'd love to come back sometime, maybe this is a good step, that after the initial pain (for you) they can stop having to use the "make it miserable to control inflation" tool, but as i said, I doubt it now, but it would be nice to keep just a little hope and optimism.
---
He would have had a 10 second session change timer.   Also, after you come out of warp you're invulnerable for a few ticks if you take no action.
---
Like I said in my post,  if you run DED‚Äôs or get dank ticks for plex, it‚Äôs gonna be easier.   If 1000 ppl farm Drone DDA‚Äôs and the price is 40m, but with the blackout 200 people farm them and the price jumps over 100mil.  Shit the site runners need to run less then 1/2 the sites to make same income.  It‚Äôs math
---
What it has to do with Joji tho? Joji is not a meme
---
The number of taken solo fights in a day would drop from 10 to 2. :/
---
I've actually been playing since 2005 and have a lot of ISK, but that's beside the point!  You can never have too much ;0
---
Depends on the mods, but small gang groups and WHers often have incredibly expensive mods on their ship out of necessity
---
imo Citadel and Lifeblood undid everything Phoebe and Aegis set out to do and signaled that the future of EVE was that of an empire building RTS rather than that of a harsh, hardcore pvp focused MMO.
---
\&gt; Also less krabs doesnt affect the game.
---
Not for the huge corps that can still mine unmolested under their umbrellas and keep building SRP ships for all the "gud fights" they're getting, it doesn't (i.e. the ones with all the CSM reps that didn't point out what a big shit this would be on the little guy).  
---
It suddenly sucks to be in small corps/coalitions that were geared for mining/building.  These are paying customers that can't mine/rat afk like the big boys - and if all they can do is 'be content' with the changes, they will leave null if not the game and let the more entrenched denizens enjoy their stagnation.
---
Null now has an untenable entrance fee to everyone that wasn't in the big blue doughnut.
---
Yup that was about when I left wormholes and tried PH, the day after they started up. But they were shit. So I went back to wormholes and got predictably bored again.
---
You have station containers.
---
You really think someone would do that?
---

i'm talking to another poster, sorry you're unable to understand the concept of reddit

Love you malaka! &lt;3

im just glad someone that works there plays eve

 new comms Upwell structure = new large alliance ISK sink.

Got to tax those botter landlords ;)
---
Relaxing playstile lol...are u bot empire owner?go to hisec mate relax in lvl3
---
that's not going to work because he has a 10 second invincibility button + probably dual shield ancis. That gives him about 15-25 seconds under heavy fire. Until then the rest of the 50 man horde blob is on top of us.
---
Yuh, i wouldnt mind the rorqual as it is now if PANIC didn't exist and it didn't have excavators. Just make it a retarded strong boosting ship/mobile ore compressor, with a good local tank and the ability to repair its mining fleet/call in reinforcements while stressed.
---
I'm blacking out CCP, I won't login as long as this local blackout is in effect.
---
Is "I think you got confused" a polite way of saying "I think you're retarded"
---
killing a ramjag fast is usually not possible in a small gang. By the time you kill him the rest of the blob is on top of you
---
careful now, sort may call u a racist
---
the PLEX price is also a good indicator, the price has been dropping through the past month and has plunged in the days before/during the blackout...
---
Well, thebsystme already exists in FW.
---
You get LP for kills.
---
Some, maybe. But the decline after 2013 can not be fully attributed to that. There are just way fewer people and I think it's mostly newer players that aren't sticking. Null is pretty stable in terms of population. The increase of NPC kills in null doesn't correlate with the decline of highsec either. So if any conclusion is to be drawn from this I think it's that player retention has been failing in the last couple of years.
---
yeah wormholers, highseccers, FW pilots, null krabs, nukll roamers, NPSI bomber fleets, large bloc level warfare, groups like unspoken doing small scale sov warfare, scammers, space truckers, pure builders, inventors, explorers ..... do i need to go on? 
---
i think what you meant to say was it didn't support the playstyle you wanted to play.
---
Another space bugger crying about loosing acces to intact arme plates ...low sec  exploration ?back in magnetometrics day we used to fight for relics...this days is all about running a stupid minigame  in a insta warping ceptor
---
Pssh casual.
---
I‚Äôm not sure if this is a meme or you actually believe everything you write
---
then your gang's positioning is not great. you as the ceptor pilot dive in when the ramjag is somewhat isolated but the blob is still at 150km and less
---
I would make local come and go, not vanish completely.
---
&gt; PVP'ers dont PVE 
---
Maybe if you would be part of any alliance in low or nullsec, you would know that this is hardly true at all.
---
I believe the idea is that these bots are farming for idk, then they buy Plex with that isk, then they sell the Plex to a third party illegally. So that normally drives Plex price up as they pull Plex from the markets and make a transaction outside of the game for it. If they are not buying all the Plex to sell, Plex should drop, as long as there are near as many botters as OP says.
---
And those smart bombing machs clear havens in like seconds!
---
Oh ye of narrow view.
---
Without those capitals, the amount of ISK flowing in is severely cut. 200m/hr payouts are becoming the exception rather than the rule.
---
Those mining drones rather than excavators? Now that's less minerals flowing into factories building unassailable numbers of Titans  that are going to be  used to roflstomp any gang which comes near.
---
So on and so forth.
---
Who do you think?
---
Mom?
---
Indeed. There's no way you can justify all of its utility while it's outmining exhumers. There's no balance there, alone.
---
Goons literally, don't care we have an umbrella, and will just setup the GoonPositioningSystem....
---
please teach me how to combat probe a cloaked fleet ...
---
&gt;ccp need players buying the plexes with real money.
---
2 of my accounts wer krabs, they were paided with real money, if the krabs leave and stop plexing their accounts the price drops, which in turn results in less people buying plex it to sell it because it won't get them as much isk.
---
nice post, ty for sharing
---
No, the decline of NPC kills in highsec started way earlier than the explosive rise of those in null. Look closely at the graph.
---
y-yea dude the jag is fit with double web, double prop AND double scram

Lets say enemy fleet has 30km range and they go 2.5 km/s. Lets say it takes you only 5 seconds to go through his two ancis + 10 seconds for adc. Meanwhile enemy gang has moved 37.5 km. That means that you need to tackle a ramjag 70 off his gang to be able to kill him with very high dps before the enemy fleet takes down your ceptor. So what if the ramjag isn't so retarded to go 70 off his gang? Is it game over?
---
That'd make it such a pain to find the things you need lol, honestly some things are just better being unrealistic when it comes to a game
---
Literally nothing was stopping you from going and getting gud fights before the blackout ... but the 'pvp community' is just as risk averse as the krabs they want to hunt are.
---
&gt; Most of those 3-6 month old characters who got talked into joining 0.0 alliance should be back to where they are progression and skill wise: empire, lowsec and Provi. 
---
I just sincerely hope you aren't serious.
---
&gt; don't let people anchor any keepstars in wormhole space
---
init is already working on this case
---
I said on another comment that I was probably wrong and he was single webbed
---
...with shitheads like you? I'm doing fine.
---
Back again since May
---
True.  having only one character in an NPC corporation keeps me views limited.  I should make another toon soon
---
jesus, do you think CCP seeds the plex market or something, are you legally braindead?
---
On serious note, the real change we will see after around 30 days (aka basic 30 day PLEX/sub will finish so then we will see if they continue) next change will be visible around 90days (the basic 3month sub will end and people will decide play/not to play).
---
I like how these people act like they mean so much to the game when in reality they are part of some renters alliance sitting in the back end of null sec.
---
I hope ur reddit sub runs out

---
Citation needed

You could argue that this change does tackle these issues somewhat, but indirectly. CCP can't just delete the structures or supercaps, but the increased danger and risk of nullsec can lead the deflating effects. Industry will become riskier and so raw resource prices will go up, making supers more expensive. Supers will also be more at risk and so a combination of making replacements more expensive to obtain while also making them more vulnerable (and so more losses) might have an effect on supercap proliferation. 
---
With structure spam, the lack of Intel in less busy systems will make these structures less appealing to use as the chance of getting caught and losing your ship will be higher than in the high player density system, and might lead to fewer structures overall and more consolidation in less risky systems where you are less likely to get ganked.
---
With botting too, the lack of local will make them much less able to just warp off when someone new enters the system...
---
The removal of local seems like a small change that can actually have significant knock on effects, aside from the boost in atmosphere that I get from the fear and uncertainty that no local brings.
---
At the end of the day, the only way to fix the issues you cite is via the player driven market, and the thing that drives this market is PvP losses.
---
The keyword above was "effort". All of those things require work to accomplish, and need to be redone on a daily basis.
---
Who let a semi-literate muppet like you into the alliance?
---
this is a good post
---
I make 2B isk/hr flipping burgers at McDonalds
---
Well I got my reddit account 2 days ago so I might as well use it.
---
I haven't logged in for 3weeks now and I will not for next 2 at least. Its not becouse the blackout irl stuff, so I might not be the best one to say anything I have lived in null for I think 2 years. I like the idea but I think it's introduced awfully. How? It adds risk and some exicment but also stress and boring mashing d scan. We also have the drifters wichyou would need at least a cap to survive before the help arrives. It forces you to get a cap to rat which allows you to get the umbrella's help. new players in null now get butt fucked by hunters and drifters
---
And that's OK with me if the null is going to be elyte end game content so yeah let's tell all the players that want those 40h battles nope until Idk 2 or 3 years omega plus a fuck ton of isk. If CCP wants to make null more dangerous and end game like then go ahead but most people that want to get into eve are joining becouse of those huge null battles. By adding more risk you should add more isk we are now in wh like space with cynos gates and drifters ffs it's cheaper not to play atm just wait it out if there would be x2 or x1.5 loot, ore or bounties in while the drifter invasion... We would get more raters and miners thus more prey for the hunters
---
&gt; Later that fall EVE Online went free-to-play with Alpha clones and the  concurrent login number no longer gives a good picture of paying  accounts. 
---
Neither they did before. You can't make senseful connection with the concurrent player numbers and the wealth of the game. If  you had 60k players sitting in Jita, the game wouldn't be better. What matters is activity, so rather look at pvp ships killed or numbers in the MER to determine if the game is in a healthy state.  
---
I agree on the other part though. I find the blackout a nice idea for an event - but the event is poorly integrated and has no real connection between gameplay and what it affects. And I agree that driving the ISK income down by "fucking everyone in nullsec up" is not the right way to do it.  
---
But I am certain that CCP will be able to collect a lot of interesting information from this and hopefully make the right decisions based off of that.
---
It. Was. YOU!
---
That said i made 600-700m flipping rooks and a few curses :) seems an interesting way to play. As a pvper. I jyst stumble throigh markets.
---
I assume that there is some bad communications here.          
---
No way it is a 10 sp /kill like go to LVL 1 abyssal and farm frigates, whole site can get you easily 100+k/sp.
---
okay then
---
Wtf
---
I'd argue the exact opposite thing: Increase bounties by a few percent each month, thus rewarding those that are actually out and put their ships on the line - instead of living off from wealth that has been accumulated years or even a decade ago. 
---
Reducing or even removing bounties will make it harder to impossible for new players to catch up and also make the entire game even more risk averse. After all, you'd just need to do nothing to become richer in comparison to others.
---
Warp off and refinance the fight on a diffrent grid
---
Not even mentioning most of the botfarms went offline is showing something. For the rest of the game there is no difference between your afk krab setup and a afk bot setup. Personally i d say good ridance, bots and massive krabs had it too easy for too long and both contributed very negatively to the game.
---
Not even considering the hidden effect of all the players coming into eve, getting directed into a vni and quitting because how boring that gameplay feels. I understand some bots and krabbers enjoy the benefits of their activity and some will quit while some may adjust their operations through creative countermeasures. In the end the change is good for the game, it promotes a dynamic playstyle vs a static grind. It removes a large chunk of inflation problems. I don't feel sorry for you, you might be a good guy irl but you really fail to see the bigger picture outside of your personal playstyle.
---
Jesus fuck. I would highly suggest that you log of, open your door to the outside world and go breath in some of that magical stuff called "fresh air" because you don't need to be playing Eve if you react like this.

Back when everyone would belt rat, null pilots were by far the fastest d scanners around.  Some tackle pilots could locate targets so damn fast their skills were next level.
---
Not only DED, but relics and data already had rise on isk worthy.
---
It was my understanding that a Keepstar would only be possible as the formidable effort by an alliance to put one up. Now they‚Äôre spitting them out like raisins?
---
I sense broken game play.
---
But, so long as there are so many, I‚Äôll take one if you‚Äôve got one that needs an occupant. Why the hell not.
---
Yes. Especially in laser ships, if a jag lands just warp out, fight is over
---
CCP is the one making the changes so maybe they dont want it the way it is?
---
Somewhere in the vast emptiness of space, there someone that's so pissed he can't capitalize.

Time to open a saline in this thread
---
You must be an athlete, that jump you made was fantastic.
---
Low-effort. Lol. Ok. Any gameplay in eve requires more investment than almost any other MMO. Simply understanding the game outdoes any other MMO, let alone knowing how to play efficiently/well.
---
Guess whoever did kill your rollers is even more smug now
---
If a ship is too dangerous to your interceptor try to screen him in weapon range of your fleet and communicate on coms about it. Another way, but still risky is to heat scram ( should always be heated anyway, preferable with an extra cheap abyssal range bonus ) and go with heated mwd tangentially with the most range possible and you should slight out.
---
You are so critically stupid, it boggles my mind. I dont get hoe retarded one has to be to actually not figure out that plexing does bring in money to CCP. Plex doesnt appear from thin air, someone buys it, pays for it for real money and puts on the market for free players. Free players make the demand for other players to buy plex for cash and sell on market, you stupid, daft, pathetic shit.
---
Simply understanding the game goes beyond anything required in any other MMO.
---
I resubbed for the first time in two years
---
Frankly, I don't care.
---
Eve doesn't have to chase the absolute lowest common denominator. Nobody has to be the next WoW. They just have to do well enough.

More to the point, does anyone ever join eve after watching PVE videos? No they do not.  It's the PVP content that brings people to this game. While making the game less safe might bring in more paying bears in the short term, it will also kill the content that brings what little marketing this game gets. These are short term gains that destroy long term growth.

So no, I don't particularly care if a few thousand pilots don't come back, so long as they weren't content creators.

Some of the most fun I had in eve was playing with GalMil on an alt. Even had some big fights where dedicate FW Corps were just handing out tons of ships to militia randos and CalMil was doing the same thing and really massing... was a bloodbath.

-Would be nice if there was a "On Watch/Off Watch" button instead of leaving militia everytime you want to buy something in Jita. Or if you could play FW without having to leave your current corp.

So you're going to keep on trying to think up ways to nerf nullsec until there's literally nobody in space doing anything at all.

If you want to go down that road, you really need to argue for a reset of null.  No stations, no POS, no citadels, no smuggler gates.  Just like it was before 2005.

THE GRANDMOTHER didn't want to go to Florida. She wanted to visit some of her connections in east Tennessee and she was seizing at every chance to change Bailey's mind. Bailey was the son she lived with, her only boy. He was sitting on the edge of his chair at the table, bent over the orange sports section of the Journal. "Now look here, Bailey," she said, "see here, read this," and she stood with one hand on her thin hip and the other rattling the newspaper at his bald head. "Here this fellow that calls himself The Misfit is aloose from the Federal Pen and headed toward Florida and you read here what it says he did to these people. Just you read it. I wouldn't take my children in any direction with a criminal like that aloose in it. I couldn't answer to my conscience if I did."
---
Bailey didn't look up from his reading so she wheeled around then and faced the children's mother, a young woman in slacks, whose face was as broad and innocent as a cabbage and was tied around with a green head-kerchief that had two points on the top like rabbit's ears. She was sitting on the sofa, feeding the baby his apricots out of a jar. "The children have been to Florida before," the old lady said. "You all ought to take them somewhere else for a change so they would see different parts of the world and be broad. They never have been to east Tennessee."
---
The children's mother didn't seem to hear her but the eight-year-old boy, John Wesley, a stocky child with glasses, said, "If you don't want to go to Florida, why dontcha stay at home?" He and the little girl, June Star, were reading the funny papers on the floor.
---
"She wouldn't stay at home to be queen for a day," June Star said without raising her yellow head.
---
"Yes and what would you do if this fellow, The Misfit, caught you?" the grandmother asked.
---
"I'd smack his face," John Wesley said.
---
"She wouldn't stay at home for a million bucks," June Star said. "Afraid she'd miss something. She has to go everywhere we go."
---

---
"All right, Miss," the grandmother said. "Just remember that the next time you want me to curl your hair."
---
June Star said her hair was naturally curly.
---
The next morning the grandmother was the first one in the car, ready to go. She had her big black valise that looked like the head of a hippopotamus in one corner, and underneath it she was hiding a basket with Pitty Sing, the cat, in it. She didn't intend for the cat to be left alone in the house for three days because he would miss her too much and she was afraid he might brush against one of the gas burners and accidentally asphyxiate himself. Her son, Bailey, didn't like to arrive at a motel with a cat.
---
She sat in the middle of the back seat with John Wesley and June Star on either side of her. Bailey and the children's mother and the baby sat in front and they left Atlanta at eight forty-five with the mileage on the car at 55890. The grandmother wrote this down because she thought it would be interesting to say how many miles they had been when they got back. It took them twenty minutes to reach the outskirts of the city.
---
The old lady settled herself comfortably, removing her white cotton gloves and putting them up with her purse on the shelf in front of the back window. The children's mother still had on slacks and still had her head tied up in a green kerchief, but the grandmother had on a navy blue straw sailor hat with a bunch of white violets on the brim and a navy blue dress with a small white dot in the print. Her collars and cuffs were white organdy trimmed with lace and at her neckline she had pinned a purple spray of cloth violets containing a sachet. In case of an accident, anyone seeing her dead on the highway would know at once that she was a lady.
---
She said she thought it was going to be a good day for driving, neither too hot nor too cold, and she cautioned Bailey that the speed limit was fifty-five miles an hour and that the patrolmen hid themselves behind billboards and small clumps of trees and sped out after you before you had a chance to slow down. She pointed out interesting details of the scenery: Stone Mountain; the blue granite that in some places came up to both sides of the highway; the brilliant red clay banks slightly streaked with purple; and the various crops
---
"I wouldn't be a bit surprised if he didn't attact this place right here," said the woman. "If he hears about it being here,I wouldn't be none surprised to see him. If he hears it's two cent in the cash register, I wouldn't be a tall surprised if he . . ."
---
"That'll do," Red Sam said. "Go bring these people their Co'-Colas," and the woman went off to get the rest of the order.
---
"A good man is hard to find," Red Sammy said. "Every- thing is getting terrible. I remember the day you could go off and leave your screen door unlatched. Not no more."
---
He and the grandmother discussed better times. The old lady said that in her opinion Europe was entirely to blame for the way things were now. She said the way Europe acted you would think we were made of money and Red Sam said it was no use talking about it, she was exactly right. The children ran outside into the white sunlight and looked at the monkey in the lacy chinaberry tree. He was busy catching fleas on himself and biting each one carefully between his teeth as if it were a delicacy.
---
They drove off again into the hot afternoon. The grand- mother took cat naps and woke up every few minutes with her own snoring. Outside of Toombsboro she woke up and recalled an old plantation that she had visited in this neighborhood once when she was a young lady. She said the house had six white columns across the front and that there was an avenue of oaks leading up to it and two little wooden trellis
---

---
arbors on either side in front where you sat down with your suitor after a stroll in the garden. She recalled exactly which road to turn off to get to it. She knew that Bailey would not be willing to lose any time looking at an old house, but the more she talked about it, the more she wanted to see it once again and find out if the little twin arbors were still standing. "There was a secret panel in this house," she said craftily, not telling the truth but wishing that she were, "and the story went that all the family silver was hidden in it when Sherman came through but it was never found . . ."
---
"Hey!" John Wesley said. "Let's go see it! We'll find it! We'll poke all the woodwork and find it! Who lives there? Where do you turn off at? Hey Pop, can't we turn off there?"
---
"We never have seen a house with a secret panel!" June Star shrieked. "Let's go to the house with the secret panel! Hey Pop, can't we go see the house with the secret panel!"
---
"It's not far from here, I know," the grandmother said. "It wouldn't take over twenty minutes."
---
Bailey was looking straight ahead. His jaw was as rigid as a horseshoe. "No," he said.
---
The children began to yell and scream that they wanted to see the house with the secret panel. John Wesley kicked the back of the front seat and June Star hung over her mother's shoulder and whined desperately into her ear that they never had any fun even on their vacation, that they could never do what THEY wanted to do. The baby began to scream and John Wesley kicked the back of the seat so hard that his father could feel the blows in his kidney.
---
"All right!" he shouted and drew the car to a stop at the side of the road. "Will you all shut up? Will you all just shut up for one second? If you don't shut up, we won't go anywhere.
---
"It would be very educational for them," the grandmother murmured.
---
"All right," Bailey said, "but get this: this is the only time we're going to stop for anything like this. This is the one and only time."
---
"The dirt road that you have to turn down is about a mile back," the grandmother directed. "I marked it when we passed."
---
144 A GOOD MAN IS HARD TO FIND
---
"A dirt road," Bailey groaned.
---
After they had turned around and were headed toward the dirt road, the grandmother recalled other points about the house, the beautiful glass over the front doorway and the candle-lamp in the hall. John Wesley said that the secret panel was probably in the fireplace.
---
"You can't go inside this house," Bailey said. "You don't know who lives there."
---
"While you all talk to the people in front, I'll run around behind and get in a window," John Wesley suggested.
---
"We'll all stay in the car," his mother said. They turned onto the dirt road and the car raced roughly along in a swirl of pink dust. The grandmother recalled the times when there were no paved roads and thirty miles was a day's journey. The dirt road was hilly and there were sudden washes in it and sharp curves on dangerous embankments. All at once they would be on a hill, looking down over the blue tops of trees for miles around, then the next minute, they would be in a red depression with the dust-coated trees looking down on them.
---
"This place had better turn up in a minute," Bailey said, "or I'm going to turn around."
---
The road looked as if no one had traveled on it in months.
---
"It's not much farther," the grandmother said and just as she said it, a horrible thought came to her. The thought was so embarrassing that she turned red in the face and her eyes dilated and her feet jumped up, upsetting her valise in the corner. The instant the valise moved, the newspaper top she had over the basket under it rose with a snarl and Pitty Sing,the cat, sprang onto Bailey's shoulder.
---
The children were thrown to the floor and their mother, clutching the baby, was thrown out the door onto the ground; the old lady was thrown into the front seat. The car turned over once and landed right-side-up in a gulch off the side of the road. Bailey remained in the driver's seat with the cat-gray-striped with a broad white face and an orange nose-clinging to his neck like a caterpillar.
---
As soon as the children saw they could move their arms and legs, they scrambled out of the car, shouting, "We've had an ACCIDENT!" The grandmother was curled up under the

---
dashboard, hoping she was injured so that Bailey's wrath would not come down on her all at once. The horrible thought she had had before the accident was that the house she had remembered so vividly was not in Georgia but in Tennessee.
---
Bailey removed the cat from his neck with both hands and flung it out the window against the side of a pine tree. Then he got out of the car and started looking for the children's mother. She was sitting against the side of the red gutted ditch, holding the screaming baby, but she only had a cut down her face and a broken shoulder. "We've had an ACCIDENT!" the children screamed in a frenzy of delight.
---
"But nobody's killed," June Star said with disappointment as the grandmother limped out of the car, her hat still pinned to her head but the broken front brim standing up at a jaunty angle and the violet spray hanging off the side. They all sat down in the ditch, except the children, to recover from the shock. They were all shaking.
---
"Maybe a car will come along," said the children's mother hoarsely.
---
"I believe I have injured an organ," said the grandmother, pressing her side, but no one answered her. Bailey's teeth were clattering. He had on a yellow sport shirt with bright blue parrots designed in it and his face was as yellow as the l shirt. The grandmother decided that she would not mention that the house was in Tennessee.
---
The road was about ten feet above and they could see only the tops of the trees on the other side of it. Behind the ditch they were sitting in there were more woods, tall and dark and deep. In a few minutes they saw a car some distance away on top of a hill, coming slowly as if the occupants were watching them. The grandmother stood up and waved both arms dramatically to attract their attention. The car continued to come on slowly, disappeared around a bend and appeared again, moving even slower, on top of the hill they had gone over. It was a big black battered hearse-like automobile. There were three men in it.
---
It came to a stop just over them and for some minutes, the driver looked down with a steady expressionless gaze to where they were sitting, and didn't speak. Then he turned his
---
146 A GOOD MAN IS HARD TO FIND
---
head and muttered something to the other two and they got out. One was a fat boy in black trousers and a red sweat shirt with a silver stallion embossed on the front of it. He moved around on the right side of them and stood staring, his mouth partly open in a kind of loose grin. The other had on khaki pants and a blue striped coat and a gray hat pulled down very low, hiding most of his face. He came around slowly on the left side. Neither spoke.
---
The driver got out of the car and stood by the side of it, looking down at them. He was an older man than the other two. His hair was just beginning to gray and he wore silver- rimmed spectacles that gave him a scholarly look. He had a long creased face and didn't have on any shirt or undershirt. He had on blue jeans that were too tight for him and was holding a black hat and a gun. The two boys also had guns.
---
"We've had an ACCIDENT!" the children screamed.
---
The grandmother had the peculiar feeling that the bespectacled man was someone she knew. His face was as familiar to her as if she had known him au her life but she could not recall who he was. He moved away from the car and began to come down the embankment, placing his feet carefully so that he wouldn't slip. He had on tan and white shoes and no socks, and his ankles were red and thin. "Good afternoon," he said. "I see you all had you a little spill."
---
"We turned over twice!" said the grandmother.
---
"Once"," he corrected. "We seen it happen. Try their car and see will it run, Hiram," he said quietly to the boy with the gray hat.
---
"What you got that gun for?" John Wesley asked. "Whatcha gonna do with that gun?"
---
"Lady," the man said to the children's mother, "would you mind calling them children to sit down by you? Children make me nervous. I want all you all to sit down right together there where you're at."
---
"What are you telling US what to do for?" June Star asked.
---
Behind them the line of woods gaped like a dark open mouth. "Come here," said their mother.
---
"Look here now," Bailey began suddenly, "we're in a predicament! We're in . . ."
---
A GOOD MAN IS HARD TO FIND 147
---
The grandmother shrieked. She scrambled to her feet and stood staring. "You're The Misfit!" she said. "I recognized you at once!"
---
"Yes'm," the man said, smiling slightly as if he were pleased in spite of himself to be known, "but it would have been better for all of you, lady, if you hadn't of reckernized me."
---
Bailey turned his head sharply and said something to his mother that shocked even the children. The old lady began to cry and The Misfit reddened.
---
"Lady," he said, "don't you get upset. Sometimes a man says things he don't mean. I don't reckon he meant to talk to you thataway."
---
"You wouldn't shoot a lady, would you?" the grandmother said and removed a clean handkerchief from her cuff and began to slap at her eyes with it.
---
The Misfit pointed the toe of his shoe into the ground and made a little hole and then covered it up again. "I would hate to have to," he said.
---
"Listen," the grandmother almost screamed, "I know you're a good man. You don't look a bit like you have com- mon blood. I know you must come from nice people!"
---
"Yes mam," he said, "finest people in the world." When he smiled he showed a row of strong white teeth. "God never made a finer woman than my mother and my daddy's heart was pure gold," he said. The boy with the red sweat shirt had come around behind them and was standing with his gun at his hip. The Misfit squatted down on the ground. "Watch them children, Bobby Lee," he said. "You know they make me nervous." He looked at the six of them huddled together in front of him and he seemed to be embarrassed as if he couldn't think of anything to say. "Ain't a cloud in the sky," he remarked, looking up at it. "Don't see no sun but don't see no cloud neither."
---
"Yes, it's a beautiful day," said the grandmother. "Listen," she said, "you shouldn't call yourself The Misfit because I know you're a good man at heart. I can just look at you and tell "
---
"Hush!" Bailey yelled. "Hush! Everybody shut up and let me handle this!" He was squatting in the position of a runner about to sprint forward but he didn't move.
---
148 A GOOD MAN IS HARD TO FIND
---
Maybe it's only trigs killed in the empire space invasions and not the abyssal pockets? No idea...
---
"I prechate that, lady," The Misfit said and drew a little circle in the ground with the butt of his gun.
---
"It'll take a half a hour to fix this here car," Hiram called, looking over the raised hood of it.
---
"Well, first you and Bobby Lee get him and that little boy to step over yonder with you," The Misfit said, pointing to Bailey and John Wesley. "The boys want to ast you some- thing," he said to Bailey. "Would you mind stepping back in them woods there with them?"
---
"Listen," Bailey began, "we're in a terrible predicament! Nobody realizes what this is," and his voice cracked. His eyes were as blue and intense as the parrots in his shirt and he remained perfectly still.
---
The grandmother reached up to adjust her hat brim as if she were going to the woods with him but it came off in her hand. She stood staring at it and after a second she let it fall on the ground. Hiram pulled Bailey up by the arm as if he were assisting an old man. John Wesley caught hold of his father's hand and Bobby Lee followed. They went off toward the woods and just as they reached the dark edge, Bailey turned and supporting himself against a gray naked pine trunk, he shouted, "I'll be back in a minute, Mamma, wait on me!"
---
"Come back this instant!" his mother shrilled but they all disappeared into the woods.
---
"Bailey Boy!" the grandmother called in a tragic voice but she found she was looking at The Misfit squatting on the ground in front of her. "I just know you're a good man," she said desperately. "You're not a bit common!"
---
"Nome, I ain't a good man," The Misfit said after a second as if he had considered her statement carefully, "but I ain't the worst in the world neither. My daddy said I was a different breed of dog from my brothers and sisters. 'You know,' Daddy said, 'it's some that can live their whole life out without asking about it and it's others has to know why it is, and this boy is one of the latters. He's going to be into every- thing!'" He put on his black hat and looked up suddenly and then away deep into the woods as if he were embarrassed again. "I'm sorry I don't have on a shirt before you ladies," he said, hunching his shoulders slightly. "We buried our clothes that we had on when we escaped and we're just
---
A GOOD MAN IS HARD TO FIND I49
---
making do until we can get better. We borrowed these from some folks we met," he explained.
---
"That's perfectly all right," the grandmother said. "Maybe Bailey has an extra shirt in his suitcase."
---
"I'll look and see terrectly," The Misfit said.
---
"Where are they taking him?" the children's mother screamed.
---
"Daddy was a card himself," The Misfit said. "You couldn't put anything over on him. He never got in trouble with the Authorities though. Just had the knack of handling them."
---
"You could be honest too if you'd only try," said the grandmother. "Think how wonderful it would be to settle down and live a comfortable life and not have to think about some- body chasing you all the time."
---
The Misfit kept scratching in the ground with the butt of his gun as if he were thinking about it. "Yes'm, somebody is always after you," he murmured.
---
The grandmother noticed how thin his shoulder blades were just behind-his hat because she was standing up looking down on him. "Do you ever pray?" she asked.
---
He shook his head. All she saw was the black hat wiggle between his shoulder blades. "Nome," he said.
---
There was a pistol shot from the woods, followed closely by another. Then silence. The old lady's head jerked around. She could hear the wind move through the tree tops like a long satisfied insuck of breath. "Bailey Boy!" she called.
---
"I was a gospel singer for a while," The Misfit said. "I been most everything. Been in the arm service, both land and sea, at home and abroad, been twict married, been an undertaker, been with the railroads, plowed Mother Earth, been in a tornado, seen a man burnt alive oncet," and he looked up at the children's mother and the little girl who were sitting close together, their faces white and their eyes glassy; "I even seen a woman flogged," he said.
---
This would basically be a massive part of fixing the game, next we need a way to make it harder to jump supers on everything
---
Bobby Lee and Hiram came ambling back from the woods. Bobby Lee was dragging a yellow shirt with bright blue parrots in it.
---
"Thow me that shirt, Bobby Lee," The Misfit said. The shirt came flying at him and landed on his shoulder and he put it on. The grandmother couldn't name what the shirt reminded her of. "No, lady," The Misfit said while he was buttoning it up, "I found out the crime don't matter. You can do one thing or you can do another, kill a man or take a tire off his car, because sooner or later you're going to forget what it was you done and just be punished for it."
---
A GOOD MAN IS HARD TO FIND 151
---
The children's mother had begun to make heaving noises as if she couldn't get her breath. "Lady," he asked, "would you and that little girl like to step off yonder with Bobby Lee and Hiram and join your husband?"
---
"Yes, thank you," the mother said faintly. Her left arm dangled helplessly and she was holding the baby, who had gone to sleep, in the other. "Hep that lady up, Hiram," The Misfit said as she struggled to climb out of the ditch, "and Bobby Lee, you hold onto that little girl's hand."
---
"I don't want to hold hands with him," June Star said. "He reminds me of a pig."
---
The fat boy blushed and laughed and caught her by the arm and pulled her off into the woods after Hiram and her mother.
---
Alone with The Misfit, the grandmother found that she had lost her voice. There was not a cloud in the sky nor any sun. There was nothing around her but woods. She wanted to tell him that he must pray. She opened and closed her mouth several times before anything came out. Finally she found herself saying, "Jesus. Jesus," meaning, Jesus will help you, but the way she was saying it, it sounded as if she might be cursing.
---
"Yes'm," The Misfit said as if he agreed. "Jesus shown everything off balance. It was the same case with Him as with me except He hadn't committed any crime and they could prove I had committed one because they had the papers on me. Of course," he said, "they never shown me my papers. That's why I sign myself now. I said long ago, you get you a signature and sign everything you do and keep a copy of it. Then you'll know what you done and you can hold up the crime to the punishment and see do they match and in the end you'll have something to prove you ain't been treated right. I call myself The Misfit," he said, "because I can't make what all I done wrong fit what all I gone through in punishment."
---
There was a piercing scream from the woods, followed closely by a pistol report. "Does it seem right to you, lady, that one is punished a heap and another ain't punished at all?"
---
"Jesus!" the old lady cried. "You've got good blood! I know you wouldn't shoot a lady! I know you come from nice
---
152 A GOOD MAN IS HARD TO FIND people! Pray! Jesus, you ought not to shoot a lady. I'll give you all the money I've got!"
---
"Lady," The Misfit said, looking beyond her far into the woods, "there never was a body that give the undertaker a tip."
---
There were two more pistol reports and the grandmother raised her head like a parched old turkey hen crying for water and called, "Bailey Boy, Bailey Boy!" as if her heart would break.
---
"Jesus was the only One that ever raised the dead," The Misfit continued, "and He shouldn't have done it. He shown everything off balance. If He did what He said, then it's nothing for you to do but thow away everything and follow Him, and if He didn't, then it's nothing for you to do but enjoy the few minutes you got left the best way you can-by killing somebody or burning down his house or doing some other meanness to him. No pleasure but meanness," he said and his voice had become almost a snarl.
---
"Maybe He didn't raise the dead," the old lady mumbled, not knowing what she was saying and feeling so dizzy that she sank down in the ditch with her legs twisted under her.
---
"I wasn't there so I can't say He didn't," The Misfit said. "I wisht I had of been there," he said, hitting the ground with his fist. "It ain't right I wasn't there because if I had of been there I would of known. Listen lady," he said in a high voice, "if I had of been there I would of known and I wouldn't be like I am now." His voice seemed about to crack and the grandmother's head cleared for an instant. She saw the man's face twisted close to her own as if he were going to cry and she murmured, "Why you're one of my babies. You're one of my own children!" She reached out and touched him on the shoulder. The Misfit sprang back as if a snake had bitten him and shot her three times through the chest. Then he put his gun down on the ground and took off his glasses and began to clean them.
---
Hiram and Bobby Lee returned from the woods and stood over the ditch, looking down at the grandmother who half sat and half lay in a puddle of blood with her legs crossed under her like a child's and her face smiling up at the cloudless sky.
---
A GOOD MAN IS HARD TO FIND 153
---
Without his glasses, The Misfit's eyes were red-rimmed and pale and defenseless-looking. "Take her off and thow her where you shown the others," he said, picking up the cat that was rubbing itself against his leg.
---
"She was a talker, wasn't she?" Bobby Lee said, sliding down the ditch with a yodel.
---
"She would of been a good woman," The Misfit said, "if it had been somebody there to shoot her every minute of her life."
---
"Some fun!" Bobby Lee said.
---
"Shut up, Bobby Lee" The Misfit said. "It's no real pleasure in life."
---
wow  congrats dude, you killed my rollers with 20 T3C after camping for 8h  my farm, really, that's very cool. i just told everyone in my  corp  about it, everybody thinks that's very impressive and asked me to   congratulate you. they want to speak to you in person, if possible, to   give you their regards ( in game ) . they also said they will tell our  distant  relatives in christmas supper and in fanfest  they will ignite  fireworks that  spell your name. i also told about this enormous deed to  closer  relatives, they had the same reaction. they asked for your  address so  they can send congratulatory cards and messages.
---
my  corpmates didn't  believe me when i told them i knew the author of this  gigantic feat,  really, they were dumbstruck, they said they will make  your name echo  through years and years to come. when my friend in PL  found out about what  you did, he was completely dumbstruck too, he  wanted to know who you are  and he asked (if you have the time, of  course) if you could stop by to  receive gifts, congratulations, an AT  frig and a vouch into snigg . with the spreading of the  news, a  powerful elite FC with the name of palliner  decided to hire you as the  CEO  of his corp because of this tremendous feat and at the same time an   important casino war criminal wants to sponsor you to give  speeches  and teach everybody in his alliance how to do as you did so the world  becomes a  better place because rollers are risk averse, and you managed  to kill 2 of them. you have become famous not only here, in this C6  farmhole, but also everywhere,  everybody knows who you are. HK, hawks,  tdsin, shekel ( beens ), everyone knows your name now. the news spread  really fast and CEOs of  all alliances are setting up porticos, ballons,  colossal boom speakers,  anything that can make your name stand out  more and see which ns spinmaster can  congratulate you the hardest for  this magnificent feat at fanfest.

here  in my city, where I lived, I doxxed myself and told them about how you  killed my 2 rolling domis, the major ( in game) has decided to rename  all the streets after you beginning at the next mayoral  term. a lot of  alliances that frowned upon ours, now, thanks to your  deed, see us as a  role model, a new hope. the lucky people who know  about you say "hey,  that guy killed rollers!" and everybody shouts  immediately after them  "YES, YES, YES! yours is a good corp". thanks  to that, recruitment has  exploded, everybody came to join thanks to you, the  inflow of isk and  minerals was huge, making our market take  off and making our homehole a  target for eviction due to all the loot it now has. Our farm WH is now  the pillar for the solution of internation  economic crisis. The 2 domis  now have a monument after them. Plex price inflation? No longer exists  thanks to that, we are seen as role models, and we have  surpassed all  the C5 corps combined ( except NV because their pulsar and planets are  flat like  pancakes ) and become the richest and most powerful C5  alliance in the  game.
---
all  the rmters were very moved by your deed and  collectively decided to  stop botting so the  game can thrive more and more, hence the lower  player count. the nullsec chaos  due to the loss of local has ceased due  to the  fact that they are no longer afraid after witnessing your feat.  the in game  Pope has sent his preachers all over the cluster to speak  of your name and  your deeds so you work is known by every creature that  walks on the  surface of this cluster of stars. also, because of you,  the scientists at CONCORD have decided to stop experimenting with the  large eve gate collider, since  the origins of the universe don't matter  anymore comparing to the  magnitude of your feat. the sleepers came  back from the Andromeda galaxy  and said you were the reason they  decided to let us live beyond the year  2018. your feat was so  incredible it ejected the alpha celestial body  that was inhabiting the  jita 4-4 orbit and threatening to destroy it.  because of you, Akira  Toryama decided to continue the dragon ball sagas ( the only honorable  anime after yugioh gx, so it counts as cartoon) ,  this time with a  character in your honor. every eve podcast, at the  end of their show,  now sends greetings to our whole alliance and one  specially to your C4  corp that only kills rollers with cloaky t3cs. keep on always being this  wonderful, hard working,  beautiful, inspiring, manificent, good  spirited, creative etc. c4 corps and always keep on doing stuff life  this. Kept it up dude, and the game will be more and more a better place  to live.
---
Can't remember if I replied...did that..everybody shows up on the manage characters but still don't appear at all on the toon dropdown up on the right
---
Problem right now is that you need absolutely overwhelming force to clear a keepstar that is fitted, gunned and defended. Acting as a force multiplier it is extremely difficult to get even a relatively small group out of it as the attacker. There needs to be some amendment to interaction.
---
If Project Nova was able to arrive sooner and Eve players were able to initiate boarding parties into a Keepstar that had a meaningful impact on the space battle outside then that would be pretty worth. The nature of the invulnerability timers as well meant you would be able to set up a boarding party to be there at an appropriate time, put that time out to contract and select the Merc group you wanted to do the fight. Then at that time the Nova server would open up to that group at that time. They would fight the map, the outcome of which would have an effect on the space battle. 
---
The Merc squad that took the contract could sub-contact if they couldn't get the numbers at the time, suffering from a greater loss of income for their contact as sub-contracters would be more expensive. 
---
The Nova fight would need to resolve before the space fight, hopefully just before the timer came out. This would give the space battle a choice to stand down or not if their objectives couldn't be met.
---
Once upon a time, there was an idea that mechanics, rather than social interaction, controlled New Eden.
---
So, an experiment was run - would removing a tool change the game, or would this be overwhelmed by player actions ?
---
Local then got removed. An ex-Black Legion type took advantage of this, by doing a two-Titan driveby of a Brave Newbies mining rorqual, on the grounds that if they can't see me then the gank will totally work, right ?
---
Brave, despite the initial disadvantage of having an AFK CEO who preferred to go far away hunting relic sites and not actually lead, did over the years manage to develop a culture of a standing fleet that provides fun per hour by helping protect members, so when they found the titan that did the driveby, the fuck-you button was pressed, the cyno lit and vengence streamed forth.
---
Thus, when Local disappeared, rorqual losses in Brave were actually lower than a usual weekend, because spodbrain is a thing, and miners do have this ability to ignore intel channels, not watch what is happening around them, and in all ways be vulnerable to ganks ... but apparently this is overridden by local being gone, and so they get in fleet, on comms and are able to help protect everyone.
---
Thus, it was proved that social interaction is more important than mechanics, and Brave prospered by providing somewhere newbies can be useful, help each other, and prosper.
---
The End.
---
keep fighting the good fight brother happy hunting
---
Quick question - would it be possible to regenerate (or might this just happen automatically) the history dump for the 12/13/14?  I think these are missing a lot of killmails (all low-mid thousands, but a reasonable number on the 15th)?
---
How did you realise that there'd be an blackout to invest in curses?
---
The intel is still easy. Better than before because now its never a surprise like it ised to be.
---
I won eve a few months ago and didn't have the time that the post deserves. Shattered is the man and did practically everything anyway, I just enjoyed dank leaks which I sold to PL in exchange for invites to social events and not being doxxed and - insert meme here -
---
I did not heat my MWD so that was a mistake.
---
So what you are saying is that your 3rd party website is wrong? :O
---
damn hope you get in charge one day
---
shhh, don't tell them about swing trading, I'll need to leave my hole more than once a week.
---
Posts like this are my reason for being.
---
&gt;would only be possible as the formidable effort by an alliance
---
Yeah, like that ever worked in EVE
---
Universe saved.
---
A hyena would help right?
---
Extractors are bought from CCP, not made, so they will be consumed more and thus price will go up.
---
Interesting read bud!
---
Unless you FC, this is pretty much what bloc warfare is. I was a null-seccer.
---
ranger regiment alliance numbers are about a third of what they usually are, 150 instead of ~500
---
They have to find you, you have to find them. How does this favor them if you're on top of things? It *is* in their favor if you're not paying attention but that's always been the case.
---
Totaler.com combines alot of them
---
Yeah I think they are talking about the rest of the event.
---
I started gameing when you were only limited by your imagination and skill at improv.  From there my local milkbar was invaded by pixilated aliens, all this took time to master, which we were willing to invest in, as we had plenty of it.  We  now live in an age of instant gratification, and time poor players. Waiting years to have the biggest and shineyist thing is not an option to this generation of gamers, which is why I think games like Fortnite and PUBG are so popular.  Dont be suprised when CCP start selling skillpoints directly to the players, oh wait, they did, my bad.
---
CCP has been very clear on the fact it was an experimentation.
---
This. Smaller entities will not be able to support any type of escalation over the long term.  Large blocs even if slowed, will dramatically out pace what remains and most likely absorb them (slow march to Serenity).  Soon ‚Äúroamers‚Äù, will comment about large gate camps and being blobbed.  Hubris will lead to the odd super kill but even Mar5hy can‚Äôt kill every Goon super.  I hope that I‚Äôm wrong but would bet that by the end of July we lose another 10% of the player base.
---
Well they already announced this whole month's SP events.
---
It was announced a few days before
---
&gt; only looking for prey that is not shooting back... 
---
As someone who sounds like they get ganked a lot, have you never had someone sit there with ewar on you for a while? I'm sure you have. They are doing that hoping you'll call friends.
---
&gt; who dont like blackout
---
Except this graph doesn't include July as far as I can tell, which means BO isn't accounted for in these stats.
---
you only have to kill / drive by scram the RamJag if your gang is in danger to get tackled. Otherwise its a worthless kill. Your gang being 50km off while being rdy to pull to 70km is a good engagement range in the current meta. you can sustain being locked down while the hostile gang is burning in. its not like they will have perfect human reaction and also game ticks are a thing. your average null gang is just not competent in a equal number scenario. 15s till kill the RamJah is plenty if atleast YOU time it right. Preheat your mwd and start aligning. you should be fine in your ceptor even if the hostile gang moved 37.5km (2.5km/s is also pretty fast for an average number and you base this off for all of them being full speed when you do your math)
---
Are they the ones that have been there since 2014 or not?
---
But I'm assuming that to make such a profit, you'd have to be extremely on-the-ball with that or just do plain speculation.
---
Why would 0.0 be the most dangerou space? its where the player made empires are, the name Null Sec only refers to the fact concord doesn't have a presence there. Why shouldn't you be able to fortify and make safe the space you own, its like someone building a house and then you get annoyed you can't easily stab them in their living room.
---
Oh, the "just bots leaving" cope from 2016 is alive again.
---
Links! Bifrost backpacks, a 50mn Drek, even a Gnosis works, if you singlebox a interceptor make sure you recieve them, with a linked CN scram and the extra monumentum from links and maybe snakes they should not be able to get you.
---
Or just get more rangecontrol ships if you except ramjags (lokis, rapiers, hyena)
---
oh sadness... pretty pleas??? how about like 100mil for a noob? :D
---
How would a new player buy a character on bazaar? Buy isk with Plex? That seems insanely expensive.
---
Mad cause bad.
---
Put one or two kiki‚Äôs in your small gang and he‚Äôll melt in seconds.
---
Do Domis even have the right mass to roll?
---
PvP'ers \*do\* PvE. It's just that they don't want to, so they do it as little as possible to cover their expenses/goals.
---
These are citadel modules, citadels where introduced in 2016.
---
Imagine what this is going to do to the price of null sec ores.  I may have to invest before it spikes too much.
---
if we talking small gang then yes your gang should have atleast 1 webbing ship
---
indeed, this no local change will have a big impact on the market, which will filter down into everything else.
---
So? Understanding any other mmo outdoes battle royale or something. Doesn't mean all games have to be balanced around people who have no idea how to play and don't want to learn.
---
So now we buy PLEX low to sell when the rage makes CCP inevitably backtrack and apologize? I'm on it!
---
Thanks for sharing this man.  This is making me want to get back into my market character and play some more.  I was never very good at it, mainly I just bought bulk modules off of producers and then sold them.  I never got into the whole, but off the market and then resell it sort of thing.  Maybe it is time to take the risk with a few Bil ISK.  Are you taking on apprentices by chance? lol
---
Do velators even have a killmark spot on their hull?
---
The difficulty of eve is already known throughout the MMO world, increasing this difficulty, for new players especially, is not in the interest of this game or its playerbase. We need new players.
---
For pvp - just get Marshal if you want to use missiles, really. Widow for pvp is at best somewhat useful as a support ship for dreadbomb, since you can still ECM fighters to keep them off dreads, yet being capable of getting FAX reps. Other than that, just don't bother. You could attempt to fit active shield with torps and target painter, but - again - Marshal is much better at that job.
---
For pve the fit is somewhat similar to how you'd fit a Raven Navy etc. - active shieldtank with cruises and a target painter. Be ready to have to cycle shield booster on and off (because Widow cap and capregen is utter garbage) depending on amount of incoming dps and you should be more or less fine for mid-tier (5/10-7/10, some unrated) DEDs, while not having to gate (jumpdrive) and having a solid way out to an outcyno in case someone probes you down. As for actual fit - something like [this](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77633278/) should work more or less.
---
Resource cost x100.
---
I'm curious how much market traffic will be generated by this post alone. I'm sure there are poeple who will start to stockpile stuff you said to gain in value.
---
Of course top traders in EvE follow F.R.A.
---
let's just hope these structures don't make it go back to how it was without any effective difference in gameplay
---
Is this dead at birth? :(

Watching you try and talk down to me is like watching the bunch of idiotic dickheads back in school say something aimed to be insulting but actually retarded to someone, and then they all cheer and howl as if it's some Voltaire-level takedown; meanwhile you stand there confused, wondering whether the Neanderthals really did die out and in what world that was witty.

Stop posting before you reveal yourself to the world lmao.

how do you even come up with all these retarded posts

And all they'd have to do, is not sit on the warp in beacon.

The 1st one is designed to land on grid mjd away and snipe with cruise missiles, however the dps and volley numbers arent the best. the last one is a PvE fit, treat it like a jump drive capable Scorp navy or missile focused rattle.

If they had no reason to smug before, they sure as hell do now. My god you're a salt mine!
---
Unless this is bait, which I'll still thank you for because it's a great parody.
---
That isn't food, that's rubbery medicine rope!
---
The remaining 5 Lowsec Players will.be shocked.
---
Now give WH Vegans a Local and take them all their reason to feel elite
---
I know everyone feels different about this but i don't know why if you have had experience in everything you see blackout as such a bad thing? After living the same life you describe as yourself in eve, i find it but a new challenge.
---
This reminds me of when jump fat was introduced into the game. This also made me unsub and quit, i moved all my shit to lowsec and was done. A month later i came back with the mind set to "treat eve as a brand new game". 
---
What if in nullsec there had been no local from the start? This would just be the normal.
---
Titans were supposed to be rare
---
Industrialists have enjoyed years of unfettered pve which has fueled the unprecedented growth of super fleets. Get fukt
---
Is this not just business as usual for Delve? Not a whole lot of adapting going on when you were already gatecamping with bosons.
---
tldr
---
The botter number is if anything understated. CCP did once announce a purge of about six thousand bots. The reduced login count over Blackout is even *less* than that, so the claims of losing actual players isn't entirely cut and dry either. 
---
Bots are a massive problem and this is part of the solution I think.
---
My pleasure. Pay it forward!
---
Yeah on the top left side of the ship
---
but the blackout was only for the weekend, no ones knows when the next blackout will happen or for how long.
---
He didn't say how much he made tho, only how much he invested.
---
&gt; embrace all the older players I know that have resubbed.
---
Is Karn back, yet? I'd love to hear the boogieman of Provi is playing again.
---
Just tested this, it does nothing. "Player is offline" still shows up like normal. The only difference is that it just tells the guy inviting you that you rejected their invite if you are online. Doesn't stop any intel at all.
---
Amazing.
---
I should learn to stop trying to communicate with semi-sentient lifeforms, my bad.
---
You are correct, it does nothing to stop intel.
---
Just want until the observatories are released and us roamers/gankers are the ones without local due to ACL. Adapt or quit they say.
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
Good to see you again Reed, very interesting insight. I knew that you had to have been the guy who jacked up the recon prices, and I'm not gonna lie, I'm a victim of the rapier price increase already, heh.
---
Hope you enjoy yourself in blackout my guy. Take care.
---
It still shows you are offline if you have auto-block set.
---
Without capitals? They are the only ones left ratting, dude.
---
If you insist on bringing local back, please Give a timer to all pilots at session change. For five minutes after entering a system, you can not read or write to local. You are hidden but you'll need to rely on probes or dscan for that time. After five minutes (or other appropriate time), you write to (appear in) local but are now able to read local for other pilots who have timed out.
---
You still know if they are online, which is the point of this. If they are offline, a box comes up and says that they are offline. No matter if they are set to auto-reject or not.
---
Before my time I think. I've only been around/flying with Ushra'Khan for about 4 years on and off.
---
Yea, someone else mentioned s problem too, might be a few hours till I can do something
---
Of course it will.
---
&gt;I'm not happy about the local changes they made what so ever so im not going to be quite about it. I'm entitled to my opinion as are you. 
---
I've been fairly critical of these too, I think they're unbalanced currently. Either way, CCP can tell the difference between log one during the null event and for actual gameplay. 
---
If you log on for 30 sec to claim SP, that will show you're logging on only for the SP and nothing else. If you play in 8 hour shifts in null, that'll tell a different story
---
My guess is bots. They are gone. And the multiboxing rorqs, they are beingncautios.
---
Well this is slightly settling. I'm interested in cloak pinpoint array. 
---
Dev blog when?
---
Many in my small null alliance haven't logged in since the blackout.  You can't compare Null to WH space because WH space has limitations to what can come and go, while Jumpgates don't.  Then add Cynos.  I've been thinking of possible ways to make this work, but unless CCP gives us tools to either detect cloaky campers (Narrow scanning or special combat probes), or nerf cloaks by requiring a special fuel (This is coming from a person whose favorite ship in the game is a Cheetah).  Another Idea that we floated was the "Give us control of local" option.  Where we have to maintain our own communications network.  That way the new group of carebears, can still have their wildlands to hunt in, and we can have our defense network to fend off possible attacks.  
---
A couple of my corpmates have dumped money into eve since LAUNCH and a couple null blocs have come to them for titan building contracts.   These people aren't the rhetoric that's being spewed currently that they "bot" or "script" rat/mine.  We have occasionally have set out a couple rorqs for bait to lure in some pvp'ers to kill.  Losing a rorq or 2 due to blops is all part of the fun.  But it's not fun if you can't prepare to defend yourself.  It's "HEY, there you are, and now I'm dead."  
---
We aren't logging in.  We aren't doing mining ops.  We aren't making jita runs to supplement the rare ore or moongoo markets in highsec.     
---
On a side note, WTF was the point of making the drifters so stupidly OP?!?!  Battleships that have an omni doomsday that does 750k of damage?
---
Horde aka panfam or are they separate
---
&gt; Slightly confused if these botters are producing more PLEX to sell on market then surely the supply will only go down thus increasing prices of PLEX once botters are no longer around 
---
Botters consume plex, pvpers produce plex. By reducing the number of botters you reduce the demand on plex. By increasing the number of pvpers you increase the availability of plex. In combination this reduces price. 
---
&gt; First there is zero evidence is just a few days that Blackout is bringing in lots of old and new pvpers whatsoever. We hear like 5 people on reddit say I'm going to resub, that doesnt mean we have a huge influx resubbing. 
---
Holds true anecdotally in my alliance. 
---
&gt;Because if it's pure pvp then blackout didnt make that happen we've always been able to form a fleet and shoot others. whereas before others would form a fleet for good fights now the mind set is dock up because through the years we've move from a pvp focused game to a PVE focused game.  
---
&gt;People are not now purposely pvping each other because of blackout they are just accidentally bumping into each other when they are bot hunting. Theres a difference. Do you think once there are no easy ganks they will continue to pvp? If so then why sre they not doing it anyway?
---
 More people in space with guns results in more PVP. If you ever experienced trying to fleet up and find content in null sec with local vs say in wormhole space without local then you'd understand how obvious a difference it makes.
---
Yeah, but how do you think they present the data to pearl abyss?
---
I love the reply dude. 
---
This reminds me of when jump fat was introduced into the game. This also made me unsub and quit, i moved all my shit to lowsec and was done. A month later i came back with the mind set to "treat eve as a brand new game".
---
What if in nullsec there had been no local from the start? This would just be the normal. It is not the end of the game.
---
If thisbis tru, i will consider coming back to the game
---
Haha comparing a few losses at the beginning of a game to screwing up complete nullsec. What a Troll you are. 
---
Also he never said that it is just because of that blackout but everything around. Stupid drifters, complete Info about every System and only local disabled. 
---
The only way to Farm somewhat safe is to stay in a Block with 24/7 response. Also with those changes they could have just disabled mining abilities for rorqs or phased excavs out. Because there is no adapting to you never know if there are 5 cloaked bombers next to you.
---
Again: the amount of resources needed does a poor job in limiting numbers (and increasing it now would be bad for a whole lot of other reasons)
---
There are other limitations that might work better, like limiting it to 1 Keepstar/Sotiyo per alliance, which would probably result in a lot of alt alliances, but increase the management overhead for structure operation.
---
lol at this bullshit
---
Y'ALL ELITE PVPERS GOT CCP'ED BY CCP
---
My point exactly
---
They would have to remove bookmarks too or we will return to performance issues related to so many people having full sets of various instas.
---
It's a terrible idea.  Nullsec has enough infrastructure as it is.  We don't need any more.  In fact we need less of it.  Also this is of marginal benefit to the typical player.  Give him something he can do himself, personally.  Give him something to be good at or expert in, to be able to share that with others, etc.  
---
Another structure that does it all for us is extremely lazy in game dev terms.  I'm guessing CCP just doesn't give a shit anymore then.
---
Rigs were pretty crazy before blackout too, a lot of rigs became very very expensive overnight and have held or fluctuated around the new high. It seems supply just.. disappeared.
---
Do you have an explanation for this? What changed? I also saw that trit was like, 6 isk each for a while.
---
I've heard of the magic 14 but what's the 15th that makes them golden?
---
Well I do fc and I'm part of gsf's skyteam so I do more than push f1 gg.
---
I remember my first. Nothing quite like it.
---
bring ewar and focus them down with it and damage from ur gang every time they run in. by ewar i mean hyena or sentinel, the keres isn't great vs ramming frigs. you need to coordinate a bit but both of these ships are great vs assault frigs. as far as the ceptor goes, the drive by scrams vs jags are a lot easier with faction scram + interdiction links. a t2 fit stiletto will have a very difficult time defending itself from a jag, nvm screening for others.
---
You got the other side of it too though, less people running the Havens/Sanctums sites, less DED spawns to buy, increase in module loot value and scarcity going up will also likely increase the cost of buying the bookmarks to run in the first place.
---
You are going to end up making a loss on the sites that only drop the box.
---
So sure you can make the statement "Run DEDs for dank isk" but that just got a lot harder to do before people hunting you is even a concern.
---
It's harder to catch. Im able to update orders every 1-5 min for 5-8 hours a day. I bet I look similar to a bot when it comes to the order updating.
---
I mainly use it because I want the visual representation of other ships and my ships velocity and trajectory. It's super helpful for things like bumping someone off a gate while camping or finding that cloaky hauler that tried to run.
---
Well if you try and see it from your average line member, it literally is push f1 on the target the fc tells you and make sure you follow other commands. You‚Äôre not thinking for yourself and you don‚Äôt have to manage your mods. Even the fc tells you to pulse your prop mods the amount of times required most of the time.
---
Pretty much. Remember the exodus of players after the jump changes? About 1/3 of eve players simply quit the game outright, those were tough times back then and any action was few and far between. 
---
This change is going to bring a similar or perhaps worse result I think, but people are waiting to see the counter play ccp puts out to local being dead. 
---
Also I saw a graph last night from ccp that showed about 4000 - 5000 less people logged in throughout last weekend, compared to the July 4th weekend before it, where much of the US was out partying and enjoying time with friends and family.
---
That paints an interesting picture
---
irony
---
 *noun*
---
1. the expression of one's meaning by using language that normally signifies the opposite, typically for humorous or emphatic effect.
---
You almost got it.
---
if they hard nerf supers/rorquals, what do you think the outrage would look like then?
---
Blackout brought me back on two accounts.
---
It has been fun few days :)
---
Word. It gets old after 6 years.
---
I have no idea what will happen, i was browsing NeoCom to check some structure rigs attributes and saw that category "structure observatory service module". Passing by the information
---
This is an amazing idea, hopefullly it brings balance to this "shitshow".
---
&gt;I'm gone, probably never to return. So you sit and chew on that for a while
---
[Well... bye.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVrEwCa8nSA)
---
Got a month of some resubs. Mission accomplished. Now they'll bring it back in way to make you spend in game isk.
---
oh my god dude, where the fuck do you think you're at? Did I stumble into the minecraft subreddit or something? If you dont like something I'm doing then fucking shoot me. quit this "I'm defenseless" bullshit. No one cares if you can fight back, we only care how much your killmail is worth.
---
Hyena/huginn, curse/sentinel, Kiki are all good against it
---
Are you trying to say if cynos got a nerf and you couldn't drop caps on roaming gangs, you can't maintain your space?
---
If you couldn't protect your own space with overwhelming numbers and no caps, then maybe you don't deserve that space
---
so much autism
---
we'll have to wait and see for CCP to gather the information on black out impact... i am thinking they will decide after they see the data, which way to go. By the pattern, i guess now things are kinda dynamic at CCP, throw a rock in the water, see the general reactions and adjust where necessary without losing too many players on either sides of playstyles.
---
We won't need walking in stations. Can walk from structure to structure from one end of a system to the other.
---
It's just a bit of banter relax
---
+1 It's a legitimate complaint that non empire building play styles have been neglected for years. The eve-offline data shows this hasn't been successful for the game overall. I have resubed 2 accounts with real money. Not sure the blackout is   really going to save the game but: THINGS CAN ONLY GET BETTER .......
---
Alpha (arty), rlml spam, long webs, ecm, drone swarm. 
---
Theres various ways to deal with them, but their damage mitigation is absurd compared to most AFs. Normally need at least 2 RLML ships to kill one in a timely manner.
---
Getting a good arty volley off when its webbed does the trick normally though, since they dont get the chance to ADCU.
---
Come and listen to my story
---
'Bout a man named Jed
---
A poor mountaineer,
---
Barely kept his family fed.
---
And then one day
---
He was shootin' at some food,
---
And up through the ground came a-bubblin' crude.
---
I'm doing my best sir, just my best isn't very good.
---
I know.  I hate the idea of adding more stuff literally none of us are ever going to interact with.  We're pilots.  CCP should be giving us ship-related things we can learn to use and get good with.  They seem to be in love with anchoring and fueling.
---
Were you expecting something different?  The only change is roamers / gankers won't have local in other peoples space and now afk cloakers will have to be actively camping
---
This is actually hilarious. I'm predicting salty tears any second
---
If you ask the north, they are extremely easy to kill and not worth defending.
---
I've never seen tormentors go down that hard in my entire career. And that poor Merlin he couldn't do anything but dammit he tried to stay alive. (Only watched about 5min gotta get into work) I'll watch the rest later though. Good shit
---
Will that change tho? The big blocs will be able to protect their industrialists with superumbrellas. If anything, it will just lead to people merging into said blocs, stagnating the game even futher.
---
I hope Im wrong about this, but several streamers discussing this has hinted thats how they see this going. There could be a balance between local as it was pre-blackout and complete removal. A delayed local for example, of 30 seconds.
---
Skill injector is what made eve still alive this day with the cash that ccp earn selling them, not ruin the game. Dont you remember that ccp fired half of his staff 2 years ago? (Or something like this)
---
 I see a pussy crying for skill injector here.
---
Never injected 1 sp except free SP myself and can fly super / titan / dread; but i totally understand people that inject some skill to win some irl time to do what they enjoy in the game.
---
From CCP point of view, they care about omega accounts not connected because $$$... they don't care if it's the same dude behind the computer. money is money
---
Cool. 
---
Eve is supposed to be hard,  dangerous and rewards teamwork. This game really wasn't originally intended for the risk averse. 
---
It should not be full of bots and multi-box "renters" using near2 which both heavily depend on local.
---
Oil that is, black gold, Texas tea.
---
Well the first thing you know
---
Ol' Jed's a millionaire,
---
Kinfolk said "Jed move away from there".
---
Said "California's the place you outta be".
---
So they loaded up the truck
---
And they moved to Beverly.
---
Oh, because there is a better one?
---
This is the biggest mistake CCP has ever made. If you exchange longtime paying players for short-term casual players, that's more than a middle finger for me. And the number of people logging in at all is decreasing every day. Even helpless actions like "Season of Skills" won't change anything. This is helpless waving for logins and not real revenue. 
---
The people who are hardest hit are not the big alliances.  The small associations can't move freely anymore. 
---
And those who screamed the loudest now start to complain. We don't find any targets. The areas are empty. And those who still log in use dozens of Titans to defend themselves. That has nothing more to do with game fun...
---
That a constant change and new approaches are always good for games to keep them alive is clear to everyone. But a change that interferes with such basic game mechanics only frightens most people away in addition. You almost get the impression that CCP wants to destroy the game. 
---
So they are on the best way....
---
Actually, I want the Nova fight happen at the same time, for multiple reasons:
---
* the outcome of the Nova fight shouldn't determine if the space fight happens
---
* Keepstar fights are long enough with time dilation, 45-60 minutes of egoshooter gameplay followed by 2-3 hours of multiboxing titans isn't exiting gameplay.
---
* The attacker/defender realizing *during* the battle that their objective can't be met is when the real fun fights happen
---
* There will be players that will only play EVE or Nova and both of their actions should matter
---
Great response but not everyone enjoys the same play styles. People fall in love with this game for different reasons.
---
You say you're sick of adapting , and then expect other's to adapt instead.
---
Then quit, if you're giving up this easily, then there is no other option, I'm afraid.
---
Welcome back. Or well, I guess sorry for your loss? Since I won EVE a while ago.
---
well, i guess it's too late for a that .... northern wall is already standing.
---
Jokes aside keepstars are a stalemate, you need some abnoxious effort to destroy one. In comparison to an fortizar they provide some OP level of defense to docking and undocking ships only costing 10 times more. 200 to 300 B ISK it sounds much, but a corporation with 30 very active players is capable to finance one in 6 month by contributing constantly towards it and that without a burn out. So it's not that difficult to achieve building one given the circumstances. On alliance or even coalition level for most power blocks the price is a joke. If there is enough supply of material they can afford to place at least 2 of them a month. 
---
Significantly more material requirements for building one and nerving the EHP of the keepstar might change the quadriple influx of keepstars.
---
We enjoyed bombing another set of excavators whilst reading the Discord telling them not to use excavators again üòÇ
---
And I've re-subbed my 2 PvP accounts, so there goes you countering the second guy
---
But CCP had to put in an activity tracker to find any of this out.
---
If they make it part of the tcu/ihub and it can be entosis'd to shut it down then it has some engagement potential.
---
Velator are op my dude : Look what i've catched this weekend.

---
Dude, if that's your take on EVE then you fail to see a huge part of the game.
---
OH Oh nice , more structure for make old local , anti-cloak system for avoid cloaky camp , More farming for fuel all this structure , more ice &amp; more PI .  
---
See to remove all automatic gameplay , anom in sov 0.0 only accessible for owner that see are a good idea , hunter need prob for kill ratting ship and mining ship  Gj .
---
I log in my afk cloakers only when I want to check for people in a system. I no-longer need to leave them logged in 24/7 to do afk cloaky things.
---
If you have eyes on gates or neighboring systems you should know if it's hostile or not.
---
so tell us, what do you think is the preferred playstyle of a typical whale (plex supplier)?
---
Got drunk on friday and blacked out...still in recovery
---
Anything below cruiser will melt in seconds if you have 2 kikis.
---
I thought a drag bubble will pull you up to 500km. Why won't you get dragged into the bubble at 100km warp in? Is it because of velocity?
---
They're basing it on the same thing people saying blackout is the most fun any PvPer has had in years. Made up facts from their own personal echo chamber.
---
That will contain much more detail, this is very high level from a 3rd party datasource so shouldn't be taken too seriously tbh
---
Cool, thank you!
---
That's not what I meant to say. I'm saying that I've been adapting for a very long time now, is it too much to ask that for once, just once, others should have to adapt as well?
---
See, what I'm also not getting is this: bigblocnullseccer0089048 says he'll quit the game over this, but in the same post he's telling me this will have no effect on his alliance. Then I'm asking myself: Why the fuck are you quitting then? Do you just want to keep local around because it degrades other people's experience if apparently it doesn't affect yours?
---
i grabbed a random copypasta i had saved and switched the names, then ran it through a randomizer so it looks even more retarded. its obvious bait like an HTP skiff mining in 9UY-Provi
---
You can't remotely deal with stuff inside station containers, and you can't really put fit ships into containers too. In both cases having some hangar segmentation would be amazing thing.
---
But yet it's a 4k toon alliance :hmm:
---
indeed, the current implementation of D-scan is not much fun to use, but its also a fruit of the environment it was designed in. It was never designed to be used to the extent that the blackout 'forces' people to. I'd be super happy if it was changed and expanded on in a more user friendly and engaging way so that utilizing your sensors well in null sec is more interesting.
---
So many rants, so few TLDRs lately.
---
Fuck off.
---
This pvp is purely accidental.what happens when no more bota are there to gank?
---
What are you talking about broken game play? Local is gone gameplay is fixed.
---
I've gotten the first solo kill in months last night.
---
Which means citadel owners will have to sacrifice other modules to place these. That's good.
---
That's the troll comments handled
---
Thousands of fewer miners, not thousand's of fewer miners. 
---
Thus: 1000s of fewer miners.
---
Some of the group's who used to live in provi chose it as a home because of the content generated by NRDS. Horrible for the "care Bears" but tonnes of content / roaming gangs etc
---
They've been on sisi for years
---
PLACEHOLDER (I'll post it later, but I need this to remember and easily find the post... great initiative OP!)
---
So I bought the mct 90 day deal. I didn't realize it started automatically. I noticed my trader alt had some crap skills complete. Now his que is empty. 
---
Question is if I have no skills queud up in char 2 or 3 do I lose the time or is it just paused? I'm still figuring out a skill plan for char 3 and want to know if I need to wish it. So is the timer on the mct running without anything in the queue?
---
Yes, they are fucked. So get into one of the 4 power blocks ASAP. There's one in each timezone too!!! It's time to adapt.
---
It s also a pain to rat / mine when you are 100+ at local.
---
That is probably the most nauseating thing about all these "new ideas".  They're the same old shit repackaged with a different 3d model.
---
CCP is a game studio.  It should be full of creative people buzzing with new ideas.  Apparently nobody there has a fucking clue and all their creativity is saved up for the latest SP sale posters.
---
have you considered that if you're not willing to put up with the trouble of living in nullsec, you shouldnt live there?
---
Uh, no? Lol
---
Did you actually read my post? :D Ship hangar divisions (hanger divisions in general would also be epic). But for ships it is such a pain when you're trying to find which doctrine ship you need out of a total of 20-30 different ships or fits.
---
I kind of want to kill more of this person's stuff now.
---
May I ask what your total net worth with this character is?
---
The only issue I currently have will lowsec is the cyno drop available to anyone with a wallet and a contact, bringback lowsec gang knife fights
---
Yes. All of this.
---
Citadels and mining mechanics strongly encouraged a style of game play that is incredible risk averse. Blackout was the first step towards balancing that in a long time.
---
&gt;Why does NC. have the dot?
---
Asking the hard questions.
---
The rorqual release was a huge buff to industrialists. They were way too OP and have been toned down a little.
---
For $35 I'll collect some air from above the surface of my gamer girl bathwater for you
---
Yes.
---
No racist would be if somehow this chart was in county of login.  Not time zone.  You are making your own conclusions.
---
Fuck the pve meta.
---
You made me to buy reddit coins for the first time ever so i could give you platinum.
---
Boosh ravens can kill then pretty easily I hear :D
---
Newer PvE sites do have warps and newer AI, but the mission AIs normally just despawn if they're meant to warp away. I'm guessing due to older mechanics.
---
Or just put up more citadels.
---
extractors and plex serve the same purpose, so they move in lockstep in price.  
---
https://evemarketer.com/types/44992/history
---
https://evemarketer.com/types/40519/history
---
plex goes down, extractors go down and vice versa.  Plex is going down, so extractors will go down.
---
Most of the time gangs are just harassing the PVE players to try and provoke a gf from a response fleet. PVP players are not really just looking to "gank Indy players".
---
Getting to much plat/gold/silver for this to happen.
---
But having your stoic defence be undone at the last moment seems unenjoyable.
---
&gt;First there is zero evidence is just a few days that Blackout is bringing in lots of old and new pvpers whatsoever.     
---
I can personally say that my old channels for shooting nerds have been full of people who have not seen each other in years.
---
Myself included.     
---
This has been one of the only things in recent years that have really sparked my interest in EVE again, and brought a lot of people back.
---
Oh good, more structure bashes.   Just what everyone was asking for.
---
Spicy
---
This guy fucking gets it... The guys who are quitting now deserve it
---
I've won EvE for a year now. Reddit is suspiciously more enjoyment than that cursed game.
---
GUY THAT .01 ISK'D ME, REPORTED.
---
If they did that then NPC Nullsec would become the most dangerous space in EVE since you couldn't use these there.
---
You are retarded as fuck if you believe that. Go fly to 1dq and look at the structure list. We have like 50 forts alone.... just more structure spam if ccp does this shit. And blackout will be worthless
---
Yes and no, the EVE player base technically don't overlap with the shooter, and the point of going on console was to get hands into he player base that was into shooters. At that time most of them were on consoles. So it makes logical sense. Also the ones that would make sense to try to attract are the COD and Halo type players. Reality is though during that time, people who played shooters on PC were a dedicated few deep into the scene and those who were competitive. 
---
Nowadays though with the rise of Fortnite and PC gaming in general public sphere, it makes sense to now make a PC game. Especially as the new generation is trending away from consoles. This is something Microsoft has noticed as well by focusing less on the console market and more on the ecosystem which is a more important sphere to compete in.
---
That hardly seems relevent in this topic.
---
Too bad a Marshall runs about 5 bil compared to 1.3 bil
---
I feel so sorry for you almost wanna send you a few bil just outta pity.
---
I know correlation is not causation, but this past weekend I went out of town with both my market alts loaded up with buy orders.  I did not touch those accounts to update buy orders like I normally do and still cleared more orders than usual. I am thinking maybe it was just a push to get all the sellable loot out of nullsec prior to blackout going strong.
---
Do botters drop mtu and loot the field? If they don't, I don't see the faction market changing all that much. Normal ratters will just adjust and run sites like wormholers do, just spam d-scan and have safety in numbers.
---
If you think this is going to only enable local for people who belong to a specific group, you're delusional
---
ahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
---
I kind of expected a follow up to the blackout with this, CCP have specifically stated they wish all aspects of null to be in player controls, gates, local included.
---
This at least gives players another aspect of disruption, if these arrays can be taken down or disabled, or even hacked/flipped, it could provide some interesting dynamics, but only if they're actually decently vulnerable.
---
The blackout brought me back. Resubbed on the plex I brought when I left and giving it a go again before I drop real $ on an account. I didn‚Äôt realise how much I missed eve
---
Insider trading, demand audit of csm!
---
I think that the NPCs will put them up. If they aren't tying it to sov ownership then there is a chance it could be used in wormhole space and wormholers would stroke out.
---
Not really that player base is extremely small and behaviour patterns show that the player base that plays eve is less likely to be as dedicated for a shooter set in EVE as most will be focused on drop in games. And less on something that requires alot of investment and time. 
---
The only real player base for shooters during that era was on consoles the PC shooter market catered to a different subset of shooter player base. Nowadays that situation has changed, but the issue remains. If you want the shooter to tie into EVE you have to make it fun and less time demanding. Especially for it to succeed.
---
Trade in cyclical items? Certain faction items naturally have large amplitude in market price and that means that given time you will always be able to buy some while ensuring profit.
---
As a trader myself, I notice nothing out of the ordinary at all. And you're right, the .01 isk game has been crazy the last few days, it always is on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.
---
[limit citadels intensifies]
---
don't forget incursions. I would like to see nullsec NPC data before/after incursion release in 2010.
---
thanks
---
Do you have evidence to support either theory or are you just a shit troll that sucks at trolling really bad.
---
I would say a keres would be decent in a situations like OP described. It would allow him to drive by scram the jag, and be out again before it can lock him.
---
Back in the day I had 90% of everything I owned trapped in a station following a 2 year break, I remember thinking I should probably move this stuff out, but I was lazy, ended up selling it all at a knock down price to anyone in local. Something similar would be good, like instead of assets safety to lowsec, it should be retrivable in the new owners structure. Then the new occupants get the chance to buy fire sale contracts again.
---
The burden of proof is on the one making the claim.
---
Ergo "we'll have local and you wont" requires some kind of evidence.
---
&gt;ord to run sites anymore with the risk"  
---
&gt;   Get ready because DED sites are about to become VERY valuable and worth the risk.    Think about it,
---
Yes, market bots are a problem. Especially if you are attempting to trade in Jita or Amarr. This is why I have moved all of my trading to null sec hubs.
---
Interesting, cool to see these links.
---
Any idea why it broke the trend last December? I assume some kind of sale happened as the volume of both things went up, but for some reason plex price increased even though volume went up (?!?) and at that same window extractors dropped, and then both recovered and went back to lockstep. Like you said every other time they are in basically lockstep.
---
Congratulations! You have stumbled upon a system with a wormhole generation upgrade in the iHub referred to as a ‚ÄúQuantum Flux Generator‚Äù. 
---
Mark the system down and be on the lookout for other wormholes spawning from that system!
---
How many exactly?
---
O lord the Wormholers would make scenes akin to the end times if people started setting up normal local in their holes.
---
I've only been playing two years. I was a lowsec pilot for quite a while and my friends joined Goons. Eventually the TZ of my lowsec space and word of my activity drove everyone out. My friends kept asking me to join Goons so I eventually did. I stayed in Goons far longer than i planned. I was close to leaving the game and taking a long break and then the changes started. Why? My Friends would rather go do F1 stuff or go burn highsec stuff instead of using the blackout to bait roamers. It seems to me that there would be more content if I left Goons and hunted around Delve. I feel that those guys are having far more fun than i am. But those groups i would like to join are not taking new members during the blackout. I've been wanting to go do Wormhole stuff for a long time. I also very much like the dudes i play with in the Goon squad that I'm in. But i am bored and i shouldn't be bored right now.
---
So do you think some random player from X alliance or Corp will roll up into some random alliance territory, warp to their observatory and fire off a decloaking pulse or whatever it will be called? And at the same time maybe they can offline their cyno jammer too?
---
Could be neat if they go the opposite direction of other structures.
---
No timers.   So bring a fleet that can kill it once to take it down.
---
Then a deployment of a new one after it's down is 10 to 24 hours.
---
/r/whooosh
---
Wow based goon poster. You have my upvote.
---
I've been saying they needed to make more space in EvE. Everything is way too small, and cramped. The only one with their head screwed on right in this thread is you. That and this quote:
---
&gt;If people wanted to play dangerously, they'd have moved to WHs years ago instead of staying in null.
---
Imagine being THAT fucking retarded...
---
How did u guys caught it. lol nice work, btw
---
&gt;  people who played shooters on PC were a dedicated few deep into the scene and those who were competitive. Not the player base you are going to aim for with an EVE shooter
---
You say that, but FPSs have always been popular on the PC gaming market; on top of that, Planetside and Planetside II already existed proving that MMOFPSs could be, and were, profitable on the windows platform.
---
Not OP's problem if your brain can't handle more than 140 characters at a time.
---
except it's Tuesday already...
---
Thanks! I normally kill Tormentors pretty easily in my dualweb kestrel unless they're smart and start the fight at 7km so the extra tracking disruptor and speed on the hookbill makes it even easier to tank by orbiting under their guns. The Hookbill fit I use actually has slightly lower dps than the Kestrel.
---
If you have enough isk to bling up a Gila to the excess of 5bil+high grade implants, I think you could actually do t5's. Although I'm not sure what are the skill limitations on medium drone and drone interfacing skills.
---
What makes you think the same structure module would provide local? Take another look at the screenshot.
---
I gave the ships to my fleet members, after a bit of complainning they finally accepted to give it a go. I warped us at the novice, ships were inside. We stayed outside the plex for a min. Saw a garmur land at range, about 50km from us. Open probe scan, there was a unopen large plex. I warped the fleet at 50km hoping he follow. And that's exactly what he did. Landed 4km from me. Recorded. Will be in my next video most likely. Haha !
---
Really? Only reason I didn't get more fights tonight was that I went hunting ratters. Tuskers were in our space.
---
Ferengi rules of acquisition 62: There's nothing more dangerous than an honest businessman.
---
Widow can do all DED's just fine, source: I used to do them with a Widow. But you do need an alt to outperform the healing of that base in 9/10 / 10/10 ? Cant' remember. 
---
I used a fit that I found on an old video from some Russian youtuber doing a 10/10.  I don't play EvE anymore, so I cant find the fit, but it looked a lot like your first example, minus the warp scrambler, and + a Jump Drive + Replace Torps with Cruises. You really don't want to go torps.
---
Large settled alliances tend to be anti-loss. They dont want to lose ships. So when theres no intel, theres no fleet. This way, no intel means more proactive scouting, dscan and gatecamps. Otherwise some group forms up and no scout pays attention,  they're invisible.
---
Next, while you're right about supply and demand, you also need to consider market shares and how bots multiply like bacteria. You start with 3 accounts, they generate enough isk to buy a forth and still support the three, until they have entire fleets running. And whoever controls the most of a product can gradually increase its value with inflation.
---
That is fking epic XD
---
Thanks my man :)
---
Highly overrated and just something 0.0 yards whine about
---
Doing your best is always very good!
---
Right? But people are super scared without local, which is a good thing, but it's sure not going to make activity unviable or destroy the game.
---
This is pretty much what they said when the falcon nerf was coming.
---
You realize this stuff has been there for years right and you got triggered by double troll post lol.... Do you see the cyno jammer service module? Yeah.. It's been there since citadels were released
---
KTHNX
---
I hope those don't come with shitty timers and can be fucked with by small gangs... we NEED to be able to disrupt services to generate fights.
---
No entosis either please.
---
I guess you could look at eve-offline or ccp's login numbers, or kills per hour on zkill, but I guess your narrative is that everyone who presents facts that disagree with you are making shit up.
---
Salty botters gonna salt.
---
Just what the game needs: more structures to bash :s
---
&gt; but going 20-40 jumps without seeing anyone undocked has always been normal if you're just aimlessly wandering
---
That's my point. People acted like Blackout was going to fix this by making you invisible. It didn't.
---
this would be the best thing, we have a null black out and WH gets its lights put on lol
---
look into a mirror and say his name three times
---
...*if you dare*
---
Same dude, but I quit much much before this.
---
One year and going strong.
---
Krabs, Wormholers (BTW), F1 Monkeys, Highsec gankers.
---
Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when the Goon Krab Nation attacked. Only CCP, masters of all four elements could stop them, but when the world needed them most they vanished...
---
It be interesting if you had to choose to anchor either the local structure or the anti cloak structure.
---
I literally toured fade twice and zero hits on dscan except one heron and then when I went to leave, I found the gate.
---
Unless "good hunters" get a better dscan than I do.
---
I don't think we need more space, given how empty most of it still is. We just need a reason to fight over it. I'd really like it if we resumed the boom &amp; bust cycles of alliances conquering, growing, bloating and cascading when their bloat is revealed. I don't know if that will happen in the current meta where successful alliances are held together by culture more than success, though, so I'll settle for a system that encourages alliances to overextend themselves.
---
I used Widow only in Sansha space, and from what I remember it was 8/10 that required an alt to outdps the outpost reps, doing 10/10s was quite risky due to relatively low tank compared to incoming DPS (and it took forever to do). Running 6/10s was nice and smooth, if anything I'd stick to 6/10s, they even tend to pay quite well.
---
1. Exaggerate price fluctuations. Warn about probable price drop

2. Embellish the post with informations and reviews of an on-going phenomenon. This gets the post traction.    
---
3. Wait for panic sell    
---
4. Buy all the PLEX at a low price    
---
5. Wait for a month or so    
---
6. Sell at original price +X%
---
Sorry, thats how it works. You gotta budget for those 100 nyxes, boyo...
---
That said, if you're not sure how to make the money, I do run 3 of the NC. Mutual Funds. If you provide an api so I can make sure you're not a red, I can offer you the ability to buy into the fund and increase your equity.

Think about it, and drop me a PM if you're interested

Now please, tell me what you *really* think.

Orca's don't die that quick. Light your cyno and bring in your friends.

There's a system in Eso that frequently will have two dynamic medium sized holes to C1-C6s.
---
I don't think that "Appears In" field means much. Really, all that determines a wormhole type is its size, destination and duration, right?
---
obvious sockpuppet is obvious, go back to your bot farm
---
What jam?
---
I hope they make the new local module either hackable or only a "lite" version of the concord module (aka delayed local for 20 sec).
---
Take it onto The test server and practice there.

Same, resubbed 2 accounts last night after a year+ break
---
Citadels: worst change to the game ever, ruined literally everything from small gang to nullsec blocs, supercap fights and highsec trading.
---
Local Blackout: ballsiest, coolest thing a game developer has done in years, given enough time will revitalize the game.
---
CCP: hold my beer.
---
I believe they make more in the NES store with skins and shit anyway.
---
It did 10/10 just as fast as my pimped Tengu, this I know - but my pilot had 5/5 in every single missile skill and other relevant skills, and the cruises are necessary to manage to kill the frigates and cruisers fast enough, Torps won't do it.
---
Uhhhh if you can't deal with a super drop in dictors and instawarping T3Ds, y'all got some serious skill problems. Sure, they'll force you to move, if they want to ragecage you they might force you to safelog, but I've only seen such a coordinated drop once, and hilariously it was from Frat to drop on 10 guys in Cyclones. They simultaneously bridged dictors to every outgate, on top of us, and then dropped their supers. Our spies said they were sitting with about a 250 man formup on a bridge for two hours. I'll be honest, I'll take it.
---
They've never done THAT to us again lol
---
Exactly? No idea, but it's enough to know that a single channel that's been near dead for close to 3 years has life in it again.    
---
Life without any prior arrangement to all play again, and that doesn't include those who've came back, and not rejoined the channel yet, but are online now.    
---
Now i'm just one person, but there are a lot of similar stories all around, my corp/alliance chat has had similar conversations.     
---
I'd take that as a good sign that Blackout at least got more than a "meh" for us who keep an eye on EVE and have been waiting for the one thing to pull us back in.
---
I agree, I carrier RATT, Rorq mine, and do C5 WH sites just to fund my PvP. Not sure what else I'd use the isk for lol
---
Don't like facts hey. Welp that's on you dumbass.
---
Cyno jammers jam for everybody?  It wouldn't be the only mechanic that works that way.
---
I don't think anyone thinks this is a magic bullet that solves all the problems, but it's a step in the right direction. We need steps in the right direction.
---
All the things that now require more effort needed to require more effort.
---
Don't lie, you didn't read that wall of text. You whipped out your dick and jumped into the comments.
---
Gotta upvote this local\_chat.
---
Pause the sub till things return to normal and you won‚Äôt lose paid time for this bullshit.
---
That is an issue, just in case of combat blops you're so unlikely to ever lose it assuming you do everything right, it is basically one-time investment. You can still use Widow for blopsing, just ignore the ECM bonus and build around torps + a target painter, it'll just feel underpowered compared to any other blops. Not unusable by any means.
---
probably gonna be like the last events, where you had daily challenges to do something small and could only do 1-3 every set amount of time
---
It was awesome bait. I'm glad I read it. Thanks!
---
This person doesn't understand economics
---
Yes and then you have cyno beacons. Do they work for everyone?
---
But we don't need new players that are taught to funnel into the newbie corps of two alliances for the safest krabbing in eve.
---
Fuck nova.
---
Does he play the game? Warp core stabs take slots needed for dps and tank if you are armor. Also you lose range and lock on time. They are a counter with fair drawbacks. Stop crying about every single thing in the game that cost you a kill once upon a time. Jesus the whining in this game's community is beyond parody at this point.
---
yea, i guess with 2 damps the ceptor would be safe enough, you're right. the reason why i suggested the other 2 is cause they have a high kill threat to the jag by neuting him or amping damage with webs. there's also the chance of the jag getting into lock range eventually since it is a ramming frig but i guess that's down to execution on the keres' and ceptor's part more than anything else.
---
$3.5k on guns and ammo ... the zombies attacks have been rough on ya huh?
---
Please explain... I mean dont let me stop you..
---
I am betting OP has more than any of these grinders.  (Unless they have dozens of botted toons, in which case, good riddance.)
---
Wow, now that will make the game a lot more fun to play.
---
Oh, I read it alright. Reading is nice. It gives you an idea about what people think and how they arrive at their conclusions instead of tl;dr: blackout good, try adapting.
---
Thank you for the recent windfall. I made a few billion this week as a result of your adjustments to the market on &lt;redacted&gt;. I was about to have to rat, so this came just in time.
---
Miss seeing you on comms, hope you are enjoying playing in your reediculous style. Oh, and your MTU record is under pressure, so... might want to consider a return... ;)
---
o7
---
What? Type like you actually have some braincells left
---
So you are saying because the bots wont resub the price of plex will go down and that the spike in returning players will increase the module cost. 
---
Ok, thats not correct.
---
You're not taking into account the drop in module use by the botters and the spike in increase of purchasing plex by the returning players.
---
&gt; you get annoyed you can't easily stab them in their living room.
---
lmao, that escalated quickly! Think of "Without concord" to also mean "without local chat services concord provides". EZ, hypothetical situation resolved!
---
F in advance.
---
Other than that, practice on Sisi first and well, good luck. If you get tackled you are fucked.
---
You already know it won‚Äôt.
---
Oh, for pve I'd always cruises, there's rarely any reason to use torps in that situation. As for 10/10s - I don't believe you can even attempt to run them without having Crystal set and very expensive pimp fit, I always preferred to go relatively cheap with DED fits, so whenever I decided to bait blops/hunters in, I wouldn't be set behind too much if the response failed to get them in time.
---
Thanks for the tips
---
In a small gang long webs are your best defence against ram jags, not ceptors.  Once a ceptor is scrammed, unless it's dual prop it is going have a lot of problems mitigating damage.  I personally think of ceptors as ammo, similar to sabres tbh.  I cannot deny the amount of work a good ceptor pilot can do, flying on a main and using bling mods, but I personally prefer to dual box with a cheap disposable ceptor on an alt.
---
Yikes sweety imagine promoting less counters to the boring oppressive Null meta
---
We've had a lot of resubs for the blackout, and our krabs are getting a lot more engaged as well. Old players don't want to leave, a few vocal people with a lot of reddit sockpuppets are screaming because they can't run their bots.
---
No, go away
---
Cool your jets reddit hivemind, these are placeholders that were made before we even released Citadels. Nothing new in the slightest here.
---
&gt;because he now flies with someone I dont like he now sucks.
---
Funny the irony when you guys literally have kwg in your sphere
---
Not everyone is in null. I'm in lowsec. I go from NPC station to NPC station. Also, my entire alliance and blue list is probably smaller then you your corp.
---
OK then remove the gates, because any vaguely modern technology would have a log of who and what has used which gates... A list if you will.. Of local pilots.. Let's see how much everyone cries  when all gates are replaced with ansiblex and only blues can traverse space without the use of wormholes.
---
I know I'm late to the party. Going to briefly describe why I enjoy Eve and the blackout, and then offer my perspective on your main points. 
---
Basically I love Eve for the sense of danger and adventure it gives that no other game does. Tbh the pve is the worst of any game Ive seriously played, and if you're looking for balanced pvp fights shooters and mobas provide that far better than Eve ever will. What Eve provides, imo, is a hostile environment to explore and to test your ability to make and execute a plan. As a newer player I was once getting frustrated with gate camps preventing me from getting out to null for my sweet exploration isk, but then I realized that actually the pve itself was boring as fuck. Having the isk was cool, but scanning cans and playing the mini game (and chasing the loot explosion, good riddance to that mechanic) was never very fun.
---
What made it fun was knowing people were going to find me and kill me if they could. It was fun circumventing gate camps, evading hunters. Space felt interesting because of the people out there hoping to kill me, and my growing ability to prevent their success. Sure I died sometimes and it is a little painful, but that real threat keeps it interesting. I recall being thanked by a null sec dude ratting in a Rattlesnake who barely escaped being retackled after he got an MJD off. He said his heart hadn't raced like that in awhile. I thought hell yeah, this guy gets it.
---
So I've almost always appreciated the people hunting me. I do live in wormholes and sometimes roam null for content, but I think this is a good change for you too. Pve is boring with no risk. Risk is what makes eve exciting. Maybe you don't enjoy eve pvp yourself, but grinding money with little risk is boring. I'm confident you're more than smart enough to outwit the Eve AI or to scale a mining operation for more isk. So embrace the one thing Eve brings to the table, risk, and learn to do the thing you like to do in the game in the face of hostile players! It makes your wins far more satisfying. 
---
As for your points:
---
1) you totally can. You can bubble camp. You can place scouts on gates. There's plenty of ways to know who is coming they just require alts or actual players in space instead of a bot reading local.
---
2) Cynos are a fair point but also a double edged sword. They can be used against you but you can also fit one and bring in an overwhelming response fleet instantly. Who is more likely to have an overwhelming fleet available, the defenders or the attackers?
---
3) I semi agree with you here. I'm totally fine with not having these resources as a hunter, but donuse them since they're available. Really though it just amounts to security through obscurity, and given the fairly static nature of null sec people will still learn where the ratting pockets etc. are.
---
So overall I love the change, but hope Ive conveyed that my response is not "f u, adapt" but rather that I think in the long run it will also be more fun for you. If your pve is more risky its more fun, more satisfying to do successfully, and more profitable so you can spend less time grinding it.
---
This is beautiful .
---
Bro anyone with the name globby is low effort.
---
I've been saying this for years, the better half of EvE quit 2013, and all the losers that stayed are just in it for the wallets.
---
Successful market traders are like top of the food chain.  I do a bit of both personally. I enjoy solo/small gang but I also enjoying seeing how much money I can make through multiboxing. Keeps things fresh to keep changing activities and I find multiboxing is more of a challenge and makes PvE less boring when I have to be so active managing it all.
---
Every day there are 15 minutes where no one playes eve, so *eVe Is DeAd!!11*
---
Are you use rocket launcher? Sr if I‚Äôm not notice because I‚Äôm watching on my phone.
---
Features like this don't happen in a month, they happen over a period of multiple months. There's no way this wasn't planned by CCP.
---
Once upon a time i won 8000 PLEX .
---
END
---
Lmao just another **UPWELL** structure not like those aren't the most aids things in game
---
Let's pray it has no DPS cap and takes 24 hrs to online again
---
RIP then
---
Thank you for writing, what i thought. :)
---
I'll bite, why?
---
That‚Äôs a reach.  I know you‚Äôre just tying to be a cool kid throwing around popular memey references because we all know you‚Äôre really 12.
---
I did have a expensive bling fit, indeed, but no crystals, and it was no biggie. If you have an unstable internet, you shouldn't even attempt it tough, as you only have seconds to activate the shield boosters once in a while.
---
If the blackout ends this weekend your entire story is bullshit. Even when it doesn‚Äôt I call it bullshit.
---
Yeah I agree.
---
The returning PvP players he thinks is going to some how break the Module market will spike Plex prices to counteract the botters not buying plex.
---
This is someoene trying to make some money off the blackout
---
This should be stickied.
---
people love sucking that sweet sweet CCP dick on any occasion they get, don't they?
---
mite as well use them you guys have already messed the game up. also what about the admin hubs and the observatories from the 2017 eve vagas upwell structures road map
---
You lose the time, it is running already if you bought the 90 day deal. You should add skills right away. Also the 90 day deal only allows one extra character to train.
---
People who never leave highsec for fear of being blown up will inevitably get bored in a game with practically no NPC driven content. IMO this game has always been about the players who enjoy player created content. Imagine how bored you would be if you spent five or more years roaming highsec killing rats and hauling stuff. 
---
Eve requires more of players than many of the people playing are willing to give. So they quit and nothing CCP does will retain those particular pilots.
---
ale Ty to jestes CCP wariat... bez kitu... 
---
jebac pvp na 100%
---
Your life must really suck hard.
---
There is always rorqs, always legitimate ratters, always camps, always explorers.
---
If you think wormholes are desolate areas with nothing happening simply because local doesn't exist you are entirely mistaken. People still gotta make iskies.
---
or let's remove ships! They're vaguely modern technology!
---
&gt;salty tears any second
---
:)
---
I wouldn't be playing this game if it wasn't for your corp and the mentality you imprinted on it in the early years.
---
Regardless of what's become of BRAVE now thanks for the good times in Barleguet and Rahadalon!
---
It's popular as a concept, but as a mechanic it's fairly lukewarm.
---
Blackout will make this more likely.
---
11 and a half tyvm
---
How many people did you guys have?
---
If someone keeps feeding, it's their own damn fault. All of the smart corps, we couldn't catch and left them alone because we would lose money every week. How hard is it to simply check local and dscan once in a while. Hisec isn't meant to be safe, it's meant to be safer.
---
OMG OMG OMG OMG ... i can't wait ... for all the people that will now start threatening to unsub tomorrow, or even today, or already clicked the unsub button because of that. :D
---
I mean Lebowski already took out the excitement factor of this thread by revealing whats behind it, but i will just pretend i didn't read it and hope for the best rage comments for ... ehm days (wasn't that long, we had the last unsub-crying-wave) :D
---
To track things better.
---
Faction scrams are a great example of this. That extra point has snagged me plenty of kills I wouldn't have gotten normally.
---
Don't let facts get in the way of a good story..
---
I think you cannot pause the sub, tbh never did it.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Slightly confused if these botters are producing more PLEX to sell on market then surely the supply will only go down thus increasing prices of PLEX once botters are no longer around
---
The botters are buying plex with isk to plex accounts or RMT. Fewer botter buying isk on the market means demand falls and prices fall along with that demand.
---
oh, I wonder what "cloak pinpointing array" could be a placeholder for!
---
Tell me how this fixes any of the major issues, such as the mega-alliance umbrella, the lack of new players joining the game. How does a blackout fix any of this? It doesnt. It makes both more likely to happen. Being elitist and thinking you're a great hunter because there is no local does not change either of these problems also.
---
Statistics show that most shower thoughts are actually toilet thoughts.

I found the video. I used this fit, but I pimped it a bit.

---
Thank God. Please don't ruin my cloaky camping with these things. The rest I couldn't care less about though I hate the idea of yet ANOTHER structure to anchor and maintain
---
This is either the best salt post or the best troll post of the year. Not sure which, but glad i found it.
---
That's fine but 10-20 people all over isnt a lot especially when anyone can log in at anytime using their alpha account doesnt mean anything.  Actually resubbing is another...
---
Now if this number is like a few hundred actual people all around then brilliant but I dont believe it is.  I'm sure CCP will share the stats at some point.
---
People didn't unsub because there was local chat. 
---
I'll ask again what are you going to do when all the bots have gone and the miners have docked up?
---
I'm someone who has been trading (selling, mainly, as part of manufacturing) for years in jita 4-4. Do you trade only in expensive, faction items or such? Because in all the time i have been trading, i've never experienced a clear "bot" in any market i'm in. And i build mostly anything T1 if it's profitable up to battleships and sometimes T2 ships.
---
What you may be experiencing is people actually keeping up on their trade orders regularly or using tools to keep track of their orders in a way that isn't just browsing every order they have in series.
---
See response from CCP. 
---
I completely agree. I would even say remove the base skills for power grid, CPU, and capacitor.
---
Curious if you will be doing a weekly stats view?
---
You know what, you're right. You do learn stuff on a daily basis while playing Eve, even years later.
---
bait... or just really dumb...
---
I read it but funny thing is i didn't see these before and i am checking regularly stuff that is unpublished (like ships, special edition stuff).
---
I'm not a fan of the fish tank model, with too many fish. A lot of people meme that there is space "unused" but that's a little lie isn't it? It's used by the alliances next door to push away other alliances. 
---
They nerfed capital jump ranges, and CCP wanted to go further didn't they? Giving us more space would be a soft nerf for capital ships. Goons and friends own half the map. Maybe goons is just too big, with too many players, to do that boom bust cycle your talking about? Maybe the map is too small.
---
yeah good counterpoint ...
---
You are clearly awesome. Your elite skills are wonderful. Point is, you're sat on a gate that most people will know about. Idiots will jump through and die, for sure, or you may good a GOODFIGHT, which is what the aim of most of this is, but a blackout doesn't change any of that. You would probably get a formup and have a goodfight with a local in place. What this does do, however, is make people more likely to join a massive umbrella alliance, it also makes it less likely that people from empire will venture into nullsec. New players most certainly won't. It's a punitive action.
---
The ships he is talking about don't care about DPS or tank. They are set up purely for farming, and in many cases botting.
---
Stop feeling sorry for yourself. The game doesn't only change for you. It changes for everyone.
---
Null sec has had to deal with 'nerfs' too. Were they in some opinions needed and proportional? Probably but that doesn't mean people didn't have to adapt.
---
Came here to post that zkill link. Not disappointed to see someone else post it first.
---
I don't think anyone assume people would be flooding into null after the blackout to change this. You just need to know how to find people in null and do that, just like we did before blackout. The difference being that you can hunt them now like you can in wormholes.
---
SOMEONE is going to be the first.  It won't be anyone who doesn't pay attention to these things.
---
OP is clearly someone who takes note of dev changes and reacts.   He has done this before and will keep doing it.   
---
Some people mash refresh on d-scan to make isk.  I bet he mashes the refresh on Eveonline dev announcements.
---
Yep it's a rocket launcher fit with two webs a scram a Saar and a tracking disruptor. I also carry an extra web and an mwd if I need to refit for example the fight against Jebis kitey Imp Navy Slicer.
---
If he is smart, he has already positioned himself in those markets before writing this post.
---
Use the data for marketing? Last event we were down 10% of our usual logins! 
---
And do you think pearl abyss are entirely clueless? They bought eve to make money. Not to be spoonfed bullshit statistics. 
---
&gt;If i log 20 some accounts in for 10 seconds each, that's 20 log ons ccp will use in their metric of It's technically a log on and in. When was the last time you saw ccp specify "undocked and active players" vs "active players" or "online pilots"?
---
They won't specify that publicly will they?
---
God damn, wormholers btw really are the saltiest chumps.
---
I played solid from 06-2013 and then left due to burnout and adaptation. for me the greener days was when they just opened drone space and capitals were still rare... back in the frege days... when you had to run 40 plus jumps with packs of vagabonds hunting down convoys of industrials trying to get their goods past l4x... those were the glory days and that kept me going for 6 years...
---
just the excitement I am reading from fellow old school peeps is really getting me in the mood to see if the green days could be just around the corner.  :)
---
Some people just don't have lives.  Not sure which market you are active in, but I haven't seen botters or any kind in the market I work.
---
In this specific context, it is faction Warfare. The real brief synopsis is that faction Warfare includes beacons then have to be defended or captured in order to earn rewards. In theory, this means that ships will fight over the beacons for control. However, some players and / or Bots set up with warp core stabilizers on these beacons so that they can make progress without any intention of staying on grid if challenged.
---
lol, why waste your time making these shit videos
---
Risk/reward.  It is an old old story.
---
Dude you can never have enough structures to grind. We need a separate structure for each of those services. All with timers set to AU tz Wednesday
---
Oh that's perfect then. Can you go ahead and summarize it for me? TIA
---
He even screwed up in the post and says that the bot accounts leaving the game will drop Plex while discussing the returning PvP players who will be of a large enough numbers to screw over the module market but not enough to even sway the Plex market.
---
It's day 2 of the blackout, and our wormhole has a connection to Tenal. With DOTLAN blacked out as well, we there's no telling how dead (or alive) the region really is, so we decide to go see for ourselves. We take out a small gang and start roaming. Inevitably, one of our pilots mistakenly goes the wrong way in his Jackdaw, and reports running into a gate camp. It's fairly standard - the gate is warp-bubbled, and there's a Loki, a Stratios and a Daredevil waiting to catch any trespassers foolish enough to set foot in their home.
---
Our Jackdaw manages to escape with his life and the invaluable intel. The hostiles are Wombat Combat - well known for freely dropping their supercapitals left and right all over Tenal and Cobalt Edge. A plan is formed - we reinforce our frigate gang with a couple of cruisers as well as a nasty Armageddon, blistering with heavy energy neutralizers. At that point it was only a matter of catching them. 
---
Our differing warp speeds work to our advantage - as we each warp to the other side of the camped gate, the frigates arrive first, then the cruisers, and then the battleship, creating a natural chain of escalation. The hostile fleet freely engages our frigates, but is then surprised and captured by the cruisers, and finally demolished by the battleship. For once, everything went as expected, and the Loki and Stratios are both dispatched, while the Daredevil makes a run for it. 
---
The Loki turns out to have been very generously fitted with various expensive modules, a lot of which are looted and salvaged by our victorious fleet. We hang out on the gate for a little while, enjoying ourselves. The loot is secure in the battleship, and we decide to go home and deposit it in our citadels. As we start on our journey back, we come across a Rattlesnake from the same group, taking the same gate as us.
---
It is clearly bait, but our ships are inexpensive enough that we decide to go for it anyway. The Rattlesnake is engaged, battle is joined, and ships from both sides start trickling in. A few Retributions for us, a fleet-issue Hurricane and another Rattlesnake for them. A Cerberus for us, and a navy issue Omen for them. Both sides are fully committed, and we go all-in on the Rattlesnake. 
---
The Armageddon is buckling under the pressure of heavy drones and artillery fire, and moments before dying it jettisons the valuable loot, hoping to preserve it after all. One of our frigates manages to swoop in and collect it and keep fighting. We are losing the fight, but the Rattlesnake is about to break, when suddenly - it reveals its true potential. With the capacitor pressure from the Armageddon gone, as well as its damage, its shield boosters don't even break a sweat as they shrug off our remaining damage and repair its shields to full. Then they start dispatching the rest of us.
---
The loot is now in one of our Retributions, but it's tackled by the Omen and quickly destroyed. Incredibly, all of the loot drops once again. Having won the field, the Wombat forces are able to claim it once more and return it to its owner. 
---
We simultaneously underestimated and overestimated our opponents - we thought we could easily defeat their subcapital forces, but they would eventually win by dropping supercapital reinforcements. Neither of those things happened, and that Loki pilot more than earned the right to take back what was rightfully his.
---
Jets cooled but are we still going to get advertising structures?
---
Apparently you never had a mach decloak and bump your JF off station.  Nothing is safe if you have the right person hunting you.  This game is full of Absolute buffoons.
---
and seven days before it is active.
---
Sounds like you want to learn the ways of the pirate, and become an elite pvper, instead of a ping watching f1 pushing ape. Awesome. Welcome to the road to skill. I'm pretty shit but at least I can point you in the right direction.
---
I definitely think heading to facwar is the way to go, get a bunch of T1 frigates and stage out of a hisec station near jita like Ichoriya, or join a militia corp. Find ones that aren't botting fronts for nullsec players.
---
as a member of FW i can confirm all by ships worth 1B plus and my pod is worth triple that.
---
Dunno. I don't do incursions tbh. Would be a pity if WTM would be the only public group left.
---
Of course we have.
---
My in-game name is Ailok Konem. Im a subcap FC in Pandemic Horde and i love running roams in hostile lands and provoke fights, escalations and such. My first day of the blackout was weird, i knew very few things will happen that day as most eve was in shock and very few brave pilots undocked, but i decided to post a fleet for the second day. Next day i started probing early, i really love to probe my wormholes and make connections. And none the less i managed to find an interesting exit in Impass and one in Esoteria. Knowing i will ping for fleet in a few hours i sent a scout in front just to probe the regions and see what is there. In both regions Rorquals were out mining but not much else on d-scan. Time has come and ping went up on Horde discord. Numbers increased with every minute to about 110 pilots and we all undocked in Goku doctrine ( bombers + kirins ). We settled on the Impass wormhole and sent a couple of sabres in front to get tackle if possible unreported. But unfortunately, we failed as the Sabre was landing on grid the last Rorqual jumped out to safety. Frustrated we hunted a few more systems and lucky we are there is a Rorqual pilot who was sleeping on the job and we have a successful tackle. We called the fleet in and started to rf his Depot and try to anchor an inhib. Few seconds after the Inhib was launched he lighted a Cyno for hes rescuers to come and help him. Just as the Horde was entering system an Orca pilot who was unaware of our presence in the system and did now see the Rorqual pilot screams, decided it was mining time and landed on grid with his orca. Died a few seconds later :) (love blackout). Rorqual pilot went into PANIC mode and we set up for the rescue fleet as we were expecting cap to drop any second. And so they did, a couple of minutes later 30+ Capitals + 2-3 Titans and some supers came trough the cyno. We warped in a ping and waited. Some capitals bounced really bad and were getting out of the safety zone so we warped on to of a lif and launched 2 squads of Focused Void Bombs to render his cap to 0. So we did as he melted, next was a Naglfar 60km off the Cyno, heavy torpedos hit him wave after wave only to die in the eyes of his alliance mates who could do nothing to save him. Next, a Revelation, who after 30 seconds had the same fate. We killed 4 Brave Capitals and moonwalked out of that system with very few losses. We went into Esteria next and we also managed to tackle a Rorqual. But Test jumped in 20-30 HAW Dreads and carriers support with Dromi Fighters. Horrible combo for us. We tried a few shenanigans but only to lose a couple of pilots with every swing. On Revelation pilot was bumped a bit from the capital group and could be vulnerable. We started to hit him as test headshot me and started to kill the booshers. Rev was in 40% armor when i lost my ship so i warped the fleet away. But i bookmarked the Rev position and i wanted to make a statement. We may lose a few but we will kill something. So we warped back at range, overloaded launchers and started to hit the Dread with Everything we got. Our pilots were dying to the other caps but none the less in 40 seconds the dread was dead and we warped off cocky as fuck. All pilots loving it we stated the blackout is an amazing change. I took the fleet home and logged in my Stain alt to do a mission.   
---
10 minutes later some Stain resident comes with the intel that 50-60 Snuff deads are gating trough stain with only 1 carrier and 2 Lokis support. We called for everyone on ts in Stain and got 6 ppl lol. We sent Sabre scouts to catch them and try to get at least a strangled dread that is warping slower. 
---
As we entered the last system we could jump in the dreads were on the in-game warping away. This is the fun part about the blackout, as they were aligning out i jumped from behind them and because local did not show my presence they felt safeish. So they hit warp before everyone was aligned. We managed to tackle 3 dreads and we sent another sabre on the outgate to bubble them and trap them there so we can kill the 3 on the in-gate. Sabre landed with the dreads and only to discover that they were jumping the gate further (regional gate) so we tackled an extra 2 dreads in that system as well. We burned some subcaps to the systems and strated to hit them. Snuff dreads were jumping out as they could and we only had a single sabre to try to tackle them under the presure of lokis. We jumped in a couple of supers and melted the 3 dreads and then we jumped subcaps into period basis to kill the extra 2 dreads tackled there. It was an amazing night. This has to be it. It was late. time for bed. Burned back home and few mins later a scout reports that they are coming back. We sent sabre in and this time we tackled the whole bunch. 40-50 dreads in out 6 man gand bubbles. We managed to keep them tackled for 10 minutes easy until tey took some safe range from the gate and our 2 sabres were in danger of dying if they go further and bubble. They decided to try their luck when last bubble went down. Oh but its blackout. You cant know if there is another sabre cloaked anywhere. Well, there was. As they warped, sabre decloaked and tackled another Revelation and a Phoenix. Both died minutes later to a gang of 6 ppl with subcaps.   
---
What a time to be alive when a 6 man fleet playing with 2 accounts each tackle the entire Snuff Box dread fleet and manages to kill 7-8 of them.   
---
Whoever sais this blackout is bad or is not that great for the little guys out there i suggest you read my story above and believe me when i say its an amazing chance for everyone. I hope CCP makes the change permanent and EVE starts to slowly become the dangerous and mysterious place it always had the potential to be.
---
my jets are out of control
---
Would be cool have defensive Upwell structure for home intel and offensive flex intel structure for getting map stats like things in a constellation or system thats a target of an offensive
---
It‚Äôs almost like there was a reason I didn‚Äôt say ‚Äúnot affected at all‚Äù
---
Not possible to debate since the subject is subjective rather than objective.
---
I was talking about force recons (i thought that was obvious enough).  
---
If the cloaky fleet wants to do anything at all they need to move arround so you can spot them. 
---
And wrt cloaky camping, the only difference between local/no local is that you loose your safety netting of 100% knowing that the camper is logged in.  Which could be argued is a detriment to the camper, atleast those trying to extort money.
---
And this leaves out the actual fundamental question that has to be asked: is it actually negative that 3rd parties can now move through sovnull without being spotted with near perfect precision?
---
You have to remember WH are completely different to nullsec they are not the same in the slightest.  They dont have an Intel whatsoever, no gates, no cynos, no cloaky campers, no dotlan and in game intel.  Whereas null is completely opposite...
---
Do you think people will still get the rorqs out as much? Especially now they aren't using excavators?
---
They now literally have no protection dscan is pretty useless in terms of getting away because it be too late.
---
All I'm doing is playing devils advocate..
---
Blackout great for killing botters but it will.also kill indys and miners mainly and the while economy needs minerals..regardless
---
I agree rorq mining has got out of hand and building costs have got super stupidly cheaper caps for example  but CCP implemented those its their fault. What did they  expect would happen? 
---
We have to have some balance somewhere and this is far far too heavily on the pvp gankers side.
---
But maybe this is CCPs goal like a Burn Jita for nullsec for a month or so...trouble. is stop it and it all goes back to normal..
---
Tbh it's hard balancing a game of this complexity unless you actually remove stuff
---
But I'm not a great hunter. Local or not, blasting through mega-alliance space still requires heavy use of dscan, cause who knows how many of those in local are bots or safed up when the intel network saw you coming 10 systems away. I don't think you have to be any better to hunt w/o local. 
---
I genuinely don't think this will have an adverse effect on new players joining. People aren't playing eve because the latest reddit copy/paste on gaming news websites raged about safe ratting. If that's why you're joining I'm OK if you go back to wow instead of do nothing to contribute to anything in Eve but your alliance's coffers.
---
Mayne you all should remove that sort of junk?
---
But where is the fun in that? Much more fun to read a lot into that.
---
Salt, so much salt... It's everywhere :P
---
Before the new api you could set up a bunch of programs to notifiy you when your orders got outbid. Idk how this works with the new api
---
Your entire channel is stolen content from various streamers. You don't add any value to what's there. Channels like this should get shut down.
---
more than half the trick of solo dropping a super is not being retarded at eve, which most players are.
---
Like the vast majority of supers lost in eve are because the pilot is a single brain cell waste of humanity.
---
KWG got kicked and no, it's not about him flying with frat, there are plenty of people that give good fights and aren't toxic screechers in frat.
---
They aren't even _IN_ frat anymore, they got FUCKING KICKED.
---
You literate man?
---
awesome reply man
---
You've helped me come up with another strategy now though.
---
1. Enter into Wormhole
---
2. Do instructed stuff like warp to celestial, make safes, etc.
---
3. Warp to 100km off of your Initial Entrance Wormhole from somewhere you won't be coming from later and put a safe there.
---
4. When you want to leave, warp to your 100km safe to observe gate, as long as the gate is not behind your safe or you get SUPER unlucky, you should avoid any vector that would hit a bubble and see able to observe from your 100km safe.
---
It's getting very obvious who the botters are. I think CCP just needs a new detection algorithm that reads reddit.
---
We've busted and rebuilt several times already, soooooo
---
Plex was a lot lower and still plenty available with real, employed humans paying subs.
---
Just because about 10k uniques in the US need to straighten your lives out doesn't mean we need to tank the game's health for you, you fucking entitled snowflakes.
---
Walking ON Stations?
---
There‚Äôs loads of test server structure stuff that‚Äôs been there since like 2016. A quick search would have saved you having to make this misleading thread
---
Falcon are you at CCP in any way concerned with corrupting your own data from the blackout, by giving players the information that it is a test / temporary?  
---
Hawthorne effect - Factory experiment for reference on the subject.
---
Once upon a time,
---
I played EVE.
---
The end.
---
You have some interesting observations, and they sound reasonable to me.  Positive for the game too as botting ultimately devalues the time of PvE players.  
---
If you're right these price trends will continue for as long as the blackout does.   So why are you posting this now?  People usually talk their book after having already established a large position - esp. when they're ready to flip and liquidate.  Is this a pump for DED modules and rigs?  You want to reduce your exposure the blackout ending?  If you are a market mover then I wouldn't want to be buying into your sell pressure.
---
&gt;but I guess your narrative is that everyone who presents facts that disagree with you are making shit up.
---
You've literally lied about the login stats and concurrent players. **They are down**, kills per hour isn't the number of people logging in, it's the same people who are now able to get easier kills/killing each other now they're brave enough to undock and look for fights regularly. 
---
&gt;Salty botters gonna salt.
---
&gt;Everyone who corrects my bullshit misinformation is a botter. 
---
Stop embarrassing yourself.
---
Props to you. You were super chill when I convo‚Äôd you after. I‚Äôm still sad about the panther miss though, so watch your back ;)
---
I can reasonably say these two groups are good. I'm not sure who in Cal/Gal WZ isn't just a bunch of botters anymore. Dirt n Glitter is recruiting.
---
There  are a lot of entrenched positions with the Blackout in Null both for and against. Each side has sound arguments as to why it needs to end or stay put and nothing I suspect will shift them from these views, the only people that matter in this are CCP and they will be looking at how this impacts on the bottom line. Number of subs before and after likelihood of new/returning players against losses from those unsubbing and actual and projected impacts on cashflow. Like all things its down to the accountants telling the devs whether it was a good idea or not I await developments with some interest.
---
Get a revenant and enjoy the full house of gtfo cards it provides
---
Mmh, it's been awhile since i had a connection to esoteria, but last time we were there with a &lt;10 man gang we had supers dropped on us two times during that single roam. 
---
But now that you laid it out, getting spotted as soon as you are 10j out from desto so that the locals can always form the perfect blob counter/get a cyno ready is *definitely* leading to good fights.
---
Stop posting dickhead
---
Fuck off already, your channel is shit and so are you for stealing other people's videos.
---
&gt;People didn't unsub because there was local chat.     
---
I'll use myself as an example here, i unsubbed because i felt like i'd done everything, killed titans, ran safaris, ground regions, highsec ganging, ninja baiting, FW before and after the rework, wspace, bloc war, small gang, cloakybros etc etc, i'd been a part of every major battle in EVE since ~'06, was there on the night of the slowcats, defended 6VDT, battle of BR etc etc ad nauseum.   
---
before long, PvP got stale, there was a cap umbrella everywhere, intel was rife, bots too reactive, and the only real fights you could get were pre-planned brawls, or working against existing intel mechanics and avoiding the counterfleets or third party blues (*oh dont attack them, they defend our X, or they're friends of our blues*) and it got boring as hell, smallgang was still fun, but it seemed like everywhere was bleeding PVP players, and eventually, smallgang became solo roaming due to everyones burn out.    
---
Removing local put the shits right up people, took some of that safety net away from people, and actively got people out looking for fights again, and it made nullsec roaming FEEL like it should, feel like it did a lot of years ago, so yeah, people didnt unsub because of local chat, they unsubbed because of staleness, and removing a great crutch of intel and safety shook that up.
---
&gt;I'll ask again what are you going to do when all the bots have gone and the miners have docked up?     
---
The same thing i did when no one mined in nullsec, find other groups of people out looking for a fight, or find those people running DED sites or trying to make a quick buck belt ratting, i may get bored in the future again, it may become more of the same, but the key point it, this change did something that CCP needed, that many people who have left needed, making it interesting enough for us to come back and enjoy it.
---
this pasta was 5/5, please post a link to the original
---
that's a take
---
* **PLEX will fall** \- Agree here. No question. A massive false demand for PLEX, particularly with miners in renter space.
---
* **DED modules will spike** \- Plausible but I question the overall impact. This isn't a simple market equation as you put it. A lot of deadspace modules are not popular, and not high volume. People who currently run DEDs, in my judgement, are already pretty hands-on players who will be able to innovate their gameplay. T3Cs are still extremely safe at getting to, running, and hauling loot from DEDs, especially if you are blue to the space you're farming in. DED escelation supply is the biggest question here.... probably fewer or more selective smartbombing Mach farming :)
---
* **PVPers don't PVE -** Overstated. Also more PVPers will PVE if PLEX falls and Deadspace rises. Some PVE activities in EVE are fun, just not worth it since the isk/hour really isn't worth it since it's been botted to death.
---
Overall I see a major deflationary pattern for ISK on the horizon, which is bad for stock holders, but good for the game overall since it means sub-capital PVE is legitimate end-game content now, enabling newer players to get into the game without needing a Rorq or Nid to get the "real" ticks
---
If you can't web them at all, the application will be awful.
---
Going to show me?
---
&gt; I genuinely don't think this will have an adverse effect on new players joining. People aren't playing eve because the latest reddit copy/paste on gaming news websites raged about safe ratting. If that's why you're joining I'm OK if you go back to wow instead of do nothing to contribute to anything in Eve but your alliance's coffers.
---
This is the difference between me and you. I care if eve doesn't manage to keep new players. I care if concurrent numbers go down consistently and no new players join. I care that my investment since 2003 simply stops because some people on the internet thought that having no social/local/intel channel increases their chances of "elite pvp" when the problem has always been them not willing to engage in fights that they might not win. You said yourself, you logged off in order to avoid a fight. Yet here you are saying that no-local is great because it promotes fights. Thats hypocrisy. 
---
Eve needs more players, eve needs new players. No local in null will result in new players being absolutely annihilated while super-caps still rat with absolute impunity. 
---
This. Is. A. Regressive. Change.
---
Yes they do. A Viator with HG Ascendencies, triple Prototype hyper lows and two T2 hyper rigs warps at 21.3 AU/s -- with a 6 second align time -- or 18.5AU/s with inertia stabilizers in the lows which has a 3 second align time.
---
You can also get a Viator to align in under 2sec with Nomads.
---
It's a little tricky and it depend what you call live in HS or 0.0.
---
But in absolute you can have it by a soustraction.
---
I guess that would be another way to balance them, no damage cap, no ref timers, the cost of a fortizar and not very much ehp.

When the ‚ÄòBlack Out‚Äô hit, I found myself in the pilots chair wearing my signature 80‚Äôs style flight jacket.  I was also jacked up on the high energy yellow liquid of life, also referred to as, ‚Äúsomething that spawns from mountain drainage.‚Äù  In my trusty Astero, I decided to find a static wormhole into Null Security Space, and by chance it happened!
---
Going at it solo, I peeked into the first nullsec area‚Ä¶  Nobody was there!  So I went in further, jumping around various systems‚Ä¶  Again, I was spooked to find that there was nobody present!!!!  
---
‚ÄúWhat is going on?‚Äù I asked myself.  (Not out loud, because I‚Äôm not crazy)
---
‚ÄúOH YEAH!‚Äù  I excitedly yelled, half remembering that there was no Local Chat.  It must have been the yellow liquid of life that was screwing up my neural implants.
---
Now that I remember why I entered Null Security Space in the first place, popping my collar, it was time to HUNT.  After using my semi-trustworthy Directional Scanner, which has only failed me a few times, I found my first Target.  Being the cloaky ganker that I am, I cloaked up 20 Kilometers off a VNI.  It was bleeping out 1‚Äôs and 0‚Äôs so fast, I could not figure out what it was trying to say, So I figured that I would put it out of its misery.  
---
Aligning to my target, I was getting closer.  The 1‚Äôs and 0‚Äôs coming off the ships was getting louder the closer I got.  At this point, my heart started racing.  The time was now‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
---
UNCLOAK‚Ä¶.  TARGET LOCKED‚Ä¶.  SCRAMMED‚Ä¶..  DRONES DEPLOYED‚Ä¶. ORBIT‚Ä¶..  
---
And that‚Äôs when it happened.  A CLOAKED PROTEUS came about.  ‚ÄúOH CRAP‚Äù (Butt cheeks squeezed) I screamed.  
---
IT‚ÄôS A TRAP‚Ä¶.  ALIGN OUT‚Ä¶  PULL DRONES‚Ä¶ GET READY TO WARP!!!!
---
And then it happened.  The Proteus joined in the fight against the 1‚Äôs and 0‚Äôs.  
---
RE-ALIGN‚Ä¶ RE-DEPLOY DRONES‚Ä¶. UNSQUEEZE BUTT CHEEKS SLIGHTLY
---
As I watched the fight unfold in real time, I kept a cautious eye on my new Proteus friend.  The VNI Exploded beautifully, but I was upset that there was no ping for that notification.  The fight was over, heart back to normal.  Friendly Pilot posted Killmail for me which was very nice.  I retreated back to my wormhole for safety.  400 words now reached because I added this sentence in at the end, payment in the form of PLEX will be accepted.

A couple of years ago, one night, I was about to propose to my girlfriend when my roommate Joseph barged into the room out of nowhere, tripped and fell over, breaking a glass table with his face. Totally ruined the mood. Now, I didn't know Joseph THAT well, don't even remember where he was from, but let' just say I put my plans on hold to help him through his injuries.
---
Joseph had gotten big glass shard in his eye, making him completely blind in that eye. He was walking around with one of those cotton pads on his eye for a couple of months. Then suddenly, he disappeared, along with my girlfriend
---
Apparently they'd bonded during the time after his injuries, and eloped together , left me behind without as much as a note. I tried to track them down, but never could.
---
In conclusion, if it hadn't been for cotton eye Joe, I'd have been married a long time ago. Where did you come from, where did you go? Where did you come from, cotton eye Joe?
---
ALWAYS ANGRY! ALL THE TIME!!!
---
Eh, i feel bad because i haven't even bought a gun this year. I'm saving for a custom 338 lapua. Gunna take a year and a half. At least ammo has gotten cheaper lately. Still $650 a year in .45 acp, $250 a year in 9mm, $600 a year in 556, and another $200 a year for range fees.
---
Just because it has minimal impact on the monolithic entities of theirballiances, doesn't mean it doesn't affect them as individuals. 
---
Example, if I suddenly got told neither me or my co-workers could work for more than 20hrs a week then the company would be fine, just double the amount of staff and plod on. I on the other hand would be fucked if I suddenly lost half my wages.
---
mmhmm )
---
I lost my faith on CCP going big balls deep
---
It's a reference to the systems inside the jump range of a staging Keepstar in Nullblock's home regions, the area they can effectively drop everything they have on any attacker with one jump.
---
So it's said that any of their structures or ships inside that are are "under the supercapital umbrella" of their coalition.
---
All I know is that it resulted in my friends and me resubbing our five accounts. And I see more and more people on my friends list logging in every day.
---
The "umbrella" is a general term used by players to describe the various heavy assets large alliances keep on standby for rapid response to attacks on their members. People can fit to their ships a highslot module called a Cynosural Field Generator, commonly referred to as a cyno, which consumes fuel and creates a beacon that ships with jump drives (such as capital ships) can lock onto and jump directly to. Large alliances keep multiple capitals ready on standby and jump them to members who are being attacked. Because these ships have a limited range of operation, the area within that range is referred to as being "under the umbrella", as it were.
---
I don't think alphas can use T5 filaments. Both those drones skills should be available though.
---
You managed to mock and make a fool out of yourself in two sentences while being completely unaware of it thinking you made some smart insightful comment, which are complete bs, is pretty clowny and humorous. I‚Äôd say that fits well enough for your dead little chicken brain.
---
If we are going to do this, we should bring back local, but you can warp to anyone in local at 0, no more hunting, no more cloaking.
---
Amount of content is an objective measure, and by that objective measure Blackout is amazing.
---
&gt; soulstraction
---
Thats how I read that
---
it requires little to moderate physical strength to operate, depending on the meta level
---
when fully expanded and properly held, it can provide quite an formidable protection against direct or AoE hits from liquified crystals of dihydrogen monoxide blocks
---
Go. Away.
---
GSF in five words.
---
Loud noises!
---
I'll still wait to see the details of this new thingies... if those work like the old service modules you can fuck with and give a "worst" version of local (like some delay on it) I would be ok with it.
---
Let‚Äôs just ignore the tracking computers. That don‚Äôt work with drones or fighters. ObV for all the gunz he has.
---
I've been back in null for about a day and cynos are reminding me of why i left.
---
Idk if I should be happy Beans are being compared to Hawks and HK or sad that we are only in parentheses next to shekelsquad.
---
Stop being so fucking salty buddy, it's not good for your health.
---
I mean they've been around for years, it's not new
---
Ok, so 35tf of CPU for a low module on a frigate is not much? Coupled with almost half of targeting range lost? And that's for a single module, when you need 2 at least for a -2? Ok, whatever you say.
---
Yeah I know. But if they come out lol
---
"The relationship between supply and demand is **indirect. When supply increases, the typical result in the market is a reduction in price point**. This usually leads to an increase in demand. When supply is decreased, prices tend to rise, with a net result of lower demand" (Neil Kokemuller, 2017).
---
Does there  have to be a finite amount of PLEX available for this to actually work as you state?  Yes, PLEX will be in less demand, but PLEX is like currency (it's just printed as needed) and it is not backed by a commodity.  In other words, it is infinite.  Supply will not change, even though demand \*may\* change.  If price does change, it doesn't seem to me it will be drastic.

God forbid, someone uses the test server for testing
---
On Friday. The blackout began.
---
I lay sick in bed, watching slack pings.
---
Suddenly "Titan tackled! - Impass caps log in" appeared. 
---
I sat up, my partner looking at me asking what was wrong. I told her that someone had an enemy Titan tackled somewhere and I watched, I waited. Eager for any news. The seconds ticked by agonisingly slowly as If I were a fly, stuck in amber. 
---
A minute passed, then another and I wanted to shout and scream and whale upon those who thought such a complete Intel blackout was such a good idea. 
---
Then a loss mail was posted, a friendly rorqual. Rip Naverin.
---
Followed by OP SUCCESS and a dead shitfit frat ragnarok, dead because a lone miner played smart. The enemy had watched, waiting for him to finish his mining. And when the last rock had gone and knew he was friendless they made their play. They dropped on him and took out the rorqual, seeking to just perform a driveby gank. And though his rorqual died he emerged victorious because instead of giving in he went back for a dictor and tackled those who had killed him. He called for help and pinged the channels and exacted his revenge, served hot.
---
He elevated himself. He became a champion, a hero, and he did it by flying brave. 
---

7o.
---
I'm not trying to claim that blackout is gonna magically fix this game, i'm trying to show you that it has upsides requiring players to be more active in defending their own space.  
---
If blackout works out, and ccp has the metrics to say it is good for the game long term let's keep it.  
---
If not fuck it and put in the trash can.  
---
But for now *please* stop being so upset about change, even if it is negative for your experience. This event has run for one weekend now.  
---
Give it more of a chance, you are out here making predictions and most blocs havn't even properly adjusted their defenses yet/we havn't seen all new hunting techniqes yet.
---
Thanks
---
No question it *can* be done. But it will be less profitable, which very well might mean that (when the extra risk from the Blackout is accounted for) PI or T2 Industry might be more profitable. Or that the supercapital umbrella protection afforded by carrier ratting might be more attractive, even if the raw ISK at risk is higher. 
---
Which would translate into fewer ratting cruisers and battleships, and thus fewer opportunities for roaming gangs and solo artists to run into them.
---
Oh jeez, I'm so used to anoik.is that I had no idea that such combinations are possible. It always was like "cruiser size wh's means c1 or hs Thera". Something new everyday
---
not sure.  one possibility is just market manipulation.  If there was a 25% sale or subs costing 400 plex instead of 500 plex, you expect the price of plex to drop.  However, the whales no likey.  So they buy it all up to maintain the price of plex (or even increase it so that a sub still costs the same isk).
---
I used your Infamous coup quote in a meeting the other day ‚Äúif you swing at the king you better not miss‚Äù it sounded a lot cooler coming from you with your raspy voice than my high pitch kiwi accent.
---
He said play not bot
---
Botters are quitting, everyone else is having fun
---
I know. That's why i mentioned it.
---
1. Make yourself known as market wizard.
---
2. Make huge stockpiles.
---
3. Convince people that stuff you're sitting on will gain in price
---
4. Profit1!oneone!
---
The authority on torpedoes has spoken
---
Well you're not the average line member then are you, so you're not the in the small minority of null pulits
---
ooff, I didn't realize it was the elitists! FUCK THOSE GUYS!
---
&gt; This is the difference between me and you. I care if eve doesn't manage to keep new players.
---
Nope, this isn't a difference. Read what you quoted carefully. I don't think this will have an adverse effect on new players joining. It's a very specific kind of hypothetically victimized new player I'm OK with staying home. People who want to play Eve because of its rep will still come if they were going to before. Especially because this whole thing is _temporary_ at the moment. If it doesn't improve the state of the game (it definitely does very little in whichever direction it ultimately lands) those hypothetical newbies will never be impacted.
---
&gt;You said yourself, you logged off in order to avoid a fight.
---
I did?
---
&gt;when the problem has always been them not willing to engage in fights that they might not win.
---
"Might not win" is not the same as immediate and absolute oppression of any content. "Might not win" is a lot of fun. There _are_ players who just want to see people whinge in local, but the healthy type of PVP that CCP should be fostering catch krabs to provoke a response. There are literal "Hold him for a minute, let's see if they form something." orders given in small gangs all the time.
---
So there wont be any new structures that relate to the blackout?
---
Pretty surprised that heavy armor wormhole fights are the furthest away from what you enjoy
---
This is basically how FW rewards for killing opposite faction ships work. And those rewards are basically meaningless in terms of how much ISK they give.
---
I used them for rolling.

Just uninstall every game You have and become StarShitizen funboy. In a few centuries from now on YOu will be able to play altered game with rest of evocatis. Meanwhile You can make weekly movies about "development" of the game. Im sure that RSI will be delighted to pay You like the rest of deluded funboys ;)
---
It all started when i noticed a praxis warping from 2E-ZR5 to SR-KBB my alt in a tengu decided warp back after warping to 01-FTD in 2E-ZR5. I jumped into 23-ZR5 and the praxis was sitting 15 off the gate cloaked, surely this was bait we collectively decided to take it.   
---
"Praxis tackled" i shouted on comms slowly apporaching him when the neuts, web and points hit. "Cyno Up, Jump, Jump, Jump" The battleships landed on grid just as my Tengu lost caps and the praxis warped out. I decided to chase around until he tether on a citadel. grrr tether  
---
A little while later we took note of a small gang with a drekevac in VJ-NQP when suddenly a rogue procurer landed  on the U6D-9A gate i jumped through with my tengu and slowly try and kill it. He played the drone pulling and retracting game while i played i'm going to slowly kill you, i got bored and dropped the cyno to finish it off quickly. As the procurer died the drekevac jumped through the gate and pointed one of our Blops before he could get off field eventually the blops got free due to an emergency exit cyno we had.  
---
About 5 minutes later the same praxis we saw earlier appeared in Atioth on the U6D-9A with drekevac in hot pursuit, we decided to 3rd party the fight the widow would be sitting out due to not having enough cap. We had 2 panthers &amp; a redeemer so should be able to kill them (Oh how i was wrong)  
---
I jumped into U6D-9A and lit the cyno. Both the Redeemer &amp; 1 Panther couldn't jump?!?! "WTF" was shouted on comms" The first panther landed &amp; my tengu went down quickly. The only panther left on field was slowly getting chewed at. He MJD out and a second later the Drekavac was behind him, but it's all good the panther is in warp. to where you must be thinking? A POCO at 100. Panther lands with the enemy fleet already on grid and the last of his structure is whittled away leaving wreckage and a pod which the pilot manages to save.  
---
Now you must be thinking why couldn't the Redeemer &amp; Panther jump, well my friends they where in the same system as the cyno due to lack of communication and not being able to see local. It was too late by the time we noticed.

Yup. Entitlement didn't work in eve, for a very long time. Now nullsec has given entitlement a playstyle.

I mean, you're not wrong but you are. The true value is the player that loses isk and buys more with real money. More so if plex is expensive (in isk) people buy less with money because because they get enough isk with less plex. The times I bought plex with cash, I never thought "oh the price is good I'll buy plex"  I thought "shit I just blew up my ship and I want to fly what I want to fly' or 'I don't want to wait for those skills". If they cost too little isk ccp can magic up more isk for no real world cost, balance too far the other way and they have to flood the market with plex which is a contract for server upkeep and potentially lost subscription. 
---
Plex is already paid for and possibly, already spent. It's not new income and cashing in a plex for game time is an expense for ccp (in server costs as well as lost) . They benefit most when the plex is bought for isk but never cashed in for game time. What they truly want is stuff blowing up so people buy plex for ships and have fun so they keep p(l)aying.
---
That's to say nothing of the stories, publicity and overall gaming experience advantages that trading afk accounts and bots for pay to 'win' players brings.

Everyone having to adapt to 0 counterplay rocket boats made me get bored of facwar :(
---
I have posted this before however I feel that it is worth saying again. The blackout has created arguments for and against and both sides are entrenched with nothing I suspect able to change there viewpoints.  In the end the blackout will stay or go after CCP accountants review the loss or gain in subs etc and the impact on actual or projected cash flow they will tell the devs whether it was a good idea or not and they will in all likelihood dictate it permanence or removal. I for one await developments with some interest.
---
Pretty sure the timer is still running. But you can petition a GM for SP if you left your skill queue empty for a significant time. Just be nice when asking. :)
---
Well the counterplay if you're a pulse ship is to fit webs instead of tackle and start the fight at range of about 10k so you can apply a bunch of dps as they approach. Other navy frigs like the fed navy comet and firetail are faster than the Hookbill so they should normally win that matchup by controlling the range.
---
Then you're probably doing it wrong. Pretty sure they are over 300.
---
I really, really hope that CCP has not been reduced to catering to the r/eve hive mind.

&gt; ther hackable or only a "lite" version of the concord module (aka delayed local for 20 sec).
---
600 seconds more like but you can neither rear or write to local in that time, so the blindness goes both directions.
---
I know some of these people.  They will drop $500 a couple of times a year on PLEX packs and they fly subcaps worth 300m - 2B with Snake pods, etc.
---
They win more than they lose (I think only better pilots survive this playstyle), but they enjoy even their welps.
---
I know corps whose fleet comps all cost 300-600mil and they have no SRP.  Players are required to be self-sufficient.  Some scam, some PvE, some credit card.  One "poor" in a corp I was in only flew tackle, but damn was he good at it!  When he lost his job he used 10 bil in assets to keep PLEXing his account and we just replaced any of his inty losses.

Blackout needs to stay. Forever. People hanging out on coms out of need brings corps) alliances closer together.

I have no idea what these new structures are.. wth is a cloaking pinpointing array....

So there are a few kinds of ramjags, in reality. From most to least dangerous to a microgang are scramweb, scram brick, and dual prop. To a solo ship the dual prop one is 100% the most dangerous.
---
The most important ship to protect your gang from ramjags with is the Hyena. Long webs are their bane, get one or two on the jag and call him primary, down he goes.
---
"variation of damage types" - they're gimmick tanked against EM and have anywhere between a gigantic and moderate kinetic hole. Load the closest range laser ammo you can if you're using lasers, they do more therm, and therm does more damage to them.
---
I've never seen a dual web jaguar before, but heated fleet ceptor scram range should be able to combat that and get the drive-by scram.
---
Instructions unclear, showered in my toilet.
---
Haven't give it a try, but I imagine you should be able to do T3s with a Stabber Fleet Issue with a proper fit.
---
That being said, you can (and should sooner or later) train into other factions ships and weapons.
---
My trade profile is kind of huge--I am probably trading in too many items. I will say that I have absolutely encountered trade bots, including broken ones that accidentally fuck up orders. I have even manipulated bots to sell to themselves before, which is quite humorous. 
---
And you are kind of right, bots seem to be, from my experience, aimed at things with normally higher than average margins, but this is not always the case.

The good old days of lowsec &lt;3
---
Not really, the lakc of duration pretty much covers any concerns we have.
---
&gt; Our differing warp speeds work to our advantage - as we each warp to the other side of the camped gate, the frigates arrive first, then the cruisers, and then the battleship, creating a natural chain of escalation.
---
I think this is one of my favourite parts of the blackout.  If you don't put in the effort to have a scout near the in-hole, it's kind of a crapshoot as to how the escalation pattern is going to play out.  I had a blast fucking around with the Tuskers last night as they played attack and retreat with us, cleverly letting a few of the most  ADD individuals dock up once round X is over, only to tackle stragglers and see how other iterations of the fight can happen.  
---
On another note, apart from 1 or 2 of our dudes, most people were more than happy to leave the caps docked up because as fun as it is to drop someone sometimes, a handful of supers are pure content killers and we were having way too much slugging it out the Tuskers gang.
---
What is a "stoic defence"? Watching your structures burn and tell yourself "this is fine"?
---
I don't know about that I still lose plenty of Hookbills XD https://zkillboard.com/character/94510470/ship/17619/
---
That's a pretty strong comp but will struggle against a ram jag. A SFI and 2 retris probably can't 1 clip a ram jag, if he's ancil+extender and uses his ADC well. Depends on the jag fit. If you can bait his ADC and disengage on grid, awesome. Otherwise you may get in trouble.
---
A corporation with a keen interest in pharmaceuticals
---
I'm going to have to keep that one in mind, lock time damping the jag lets you get the defensive scrams on him without worrying about being locked yourself.
---
How can he enjoy Reddit when he has to mass downvote everything that makes him and the goons looks bad?
---
Congratulations man!  That first solo kill is definitely the sweetest.  At least until you drop something like a T3C

1. Eve is still a means of making money.

2. You're clueless
---
One system with local chat per constellation could be okay. Should be linked to high ADM's, too, so you can still sneak around for the most part. Or just keep it black.
---
What were those nerfs? I'm not being sarcastic, i'm genuinely interested.
---
Hey, that's me! https://github.com/Meigs2/REvernus
---
Mind sharing data regarding objective measure?
---
&gt; needing 1000 titans to defend your space makes no sense either

it does if your enemy also has a shitload of titans
---
Timer resets if ADM falls below 3!
---
flair checks out
---
&gt;Then CCP announced the nullsec blackout and everything changed.  
---
&gt;For once there is something that gives me hope that my playstyle might actually have a future.
---
I did go back and reread after this comment because I was confused lol
---
It hasn't retard just look at the game now lmao

Gee, I wonder how that fucking happened

TL;DR: blackout good, try adapting

shut up mack

What about T2s? Can you link a fit?
---
"I'm not actually stupid, just a troll!"
---
When did CCP Devs become so based? Calling us a hivemind smh
---
Wedgeeee
---
Go walk the dog or something.
---
Here is my story: 
---
On Friday, the blackout happened. I did not expect things to be change much when I logged in, but I was wrong. All day on comms I could hear my fellow coalition members laughing, and talking excitedly. 
---
Apparently people thought that the blackout meant they could come to Delve and kill us easily, but as boson after boson shot these invaders in the face, it became very clear that Delve had turned into a beautiful honey trap for 'elite' pvpers.
---
Delete alliance chat and NPC stations too.
---
I don‚Äôt have a dog in this fight‚ÄîI think the blackout‚Äôs kinda cool, though I‚Äôll still play if it ends up being temporary‚Äîbut login numbers are apparently down by a few thousand.  This 2-2+2-2+2 battle you guys are waging is just an anecdotal pissing match.
---
Better lets stash trashers, coercers, bombers in Jita and lets set the universe on fire  ... not because of local or drifters, just because.
---
On the side note, considering the lore about bandwidth shortages ... CONCORD should have increased response timers, like double.
---
You will need to be more specific. What do you want guidance for/to do?
---
That's why they used intentionally vague words yesterday with "indefinite"
---
local for womholes ccplz!
---
name checks it
---
Train through Gallente Cruiser II (should only take a couple days) and try a Cynabal. Projectile bonuses, good drone bay, tanking options, plus very fast for a cruiser. Gonna be three times as expensive as a SFI, though.
---
Beyond that, there just isn't much for the alpha. Keep trainin'.
---
Joining new groups, especially ones that care about their reputation ("elite") can be tough.  
---
It:s pretty much all about you getting a name for yourself. See if they let you roam with them for one night so you can hang out.  
---
Being able to provide something to those groups is also really valuable (be good at tackling, be the dude who scans/rolls lots, be innovative with your fits,...)
---
Also see if you can motivate your friends in goons to go roam with you for a night or two, they might come around then.
---
Rigs = salvage + demand.
---
Ratting buffs increased salvage supply.  Upwell structure rigs increased the demand for salvage (Contaminated Lorentz Fluid was in the teens when I was a newb in 2014... as in 10s, not 10,000s).  But the supply from ratting increased so much it continued to depress most salvage for the last 3 years.
---
What you are seeing now is probably due to a lower supply of salvage because ratting dropped as Goons deployed.  That will continue with the blackout.  Eventually it might become a better  source of income for some.
---
A honest anwser,..... shit it's the end of the world!!!! GRAB your porn boys, were all gonna end up in a vault living with radiation rats.
---
Sure.
---
Join likeminded people that are active in your timezone and make friends.
---
EVE is most fun with the above mentioned people.
---
When they put the activity tracker in they CCP said it was to track stuff they didn't have the ability to before.  You would have thought they would have at least some idea what people were doing in game. Oh wait, what was I thinking.
---
You actually ARE still able to add characters! When you Auth a character, it will open a link to the evernus website, but the verification code is actually still in the URL of that web page. Try looking at the URL after adding the character, there should be a &amp;code=hkdn55579hr or something like that. Copy the numbers and letters and paste that into the verification window. Also, you'll be unable to download the eve.db Korjew provided. Instead, you'll have to manually download the latest version of the DB file from the fuzzworks static data export website, and put it in your appadata folder for evernus. Hope this helps, it's just a workaround until I can get a public release out for REvernus :)

Cap umbrella requires even less strength, but does have a reduced area of protection.

Been a long time Matias!  Joined you guys about 2 weeks after you formed and would FC with tsukasa, Motre, and a few other funnies.  You also encouraged me to start the original Lollipop guild.  Great time.  Just came here to thank you for all the laughs and making this game great.  I hope you do show up from time to time and do some guest FCing for fleets.  I'm sure many of us would be happy to host you if you need a couple hours to kill.
---
X up if PTSD from the Holdo dreadnought frag.
---
Limit based on what? If you say per system a group could flood it and lock others out. If you say per alliance, large groups could make holder alliances.
---
If i understand the op correctly, he is looking more for solo/microgang content.  
---
Speaking from my experience i have a blast flying with 5 dudes, 20 pilot heavy armor comps are fun but it is still not the same level of trust and communication (even when multiboxing to raise stress levels).
---
"Those that don't know me... I buy, I sell and I manipulate EVE markets on a large scale and i am not part of any alliance"  indicates that you are part of the problem.  
---
I haven't played in 5 years and will drop it again because of market manipulation, mainly, I suspect, from the easy isk that can be made in 0.0.  I don't wish to fight old battles but we all know CCP was against PVE and for PVP from the beginning.  What they learned tho was that PVPers don't want to PVP.  Having "built" their empires on the backs of other players they don't want to loose them, so no PVP only what they call PVP i.e. ganking in Hi-sec.  
---
Why is there large turnover in new accounts, because (among other things) Nul Sec "NEEDS" the cannon fodder.  Why can I not build the same ships in hi sec as nul sec? and possibly invade o.o and claim a station for a hi sec race? or claim it as a neutral station open to all?  Why the imbalance.  
---
One of the best player ideas was Inter Stellar Services which was a true neutral station in nul sec, 1 jump from a .5 system that was open to anyone, any faction, security status, alliance paid for by renting out of ship slots, etc.  He managed to get around the alliance problem by having some o.o "defenders" put money in escrow to ensure to come to his aid in event of a war dec.  
---
Then CCP reduces in a famously pre-announced stealth nerf by 75% (not a small nerf) his station defenses.  His allies decide they can loose the escrow money and abandon him. Within the week the station is gone.  This was the ONLY truly neutral station in all of EVE history and started by a player not CCP.  When I saw that, it was obvious the handwriting was on the wall. 
---
Not sorry for being long, for the enjoyment I had in the game started to die at that point.
---
Breaking up nul sec by any means would just be schadenfreude for me.  Replace nul sec with thru PVP for the sake of PVE.
---
Finally! Thanks pal.
---
Zkill, my dude.
---
no, its existential
---
Can you also turn off Concord response in high-sec? You can collect data on this change as well, you know, just to see what such a change will affect.
---
It totally has, retard. Look at the game now. Null sec blackout and r/eve foaming at the mouth.
---
Gotta mash that d-scan button like a motherfucker.
---
No having fun creates the demand for people to buy plex. Plex has already been paid for the promise of fun by providing isk to enjoy eve. They want it to be traded like a ponzi scheme sitting in people's hangars and traded, never being redeemed for its real world value. CCP make money when it's bought, they *lose* money when it's redeemed.
---
If they really needed to increase the isk price of plex to encourage more people to buy them they could magic the isk and buy plex off the market for no real world cost. They don't need a bunch of bots and semi afk accounts grinding it for them in exchange for server time. 
---
Also you should relax, hey ;)

If you're looking to grab these SKINs, be sure to do so before they're retired from the New Eden Store on July 23rd!
---
Wormholers have been using it this way for years. The big thing is grouping up. If you have 10-15 guys on comms in the same system All periodically hitting dscan, it greatly reduces the frequency with which the individual must use it. If you want to play solo, you have to scan more.
---
I‚Äôm a little PvPer. I started the game a year ago, and quickly lost interest. Grinding for isk was slow, I kept dying to rays when I tried to mine, and I never saw any of these big fleets, capitals, or fights that drew my interest in the first place. The sad thing was that the coolest thing that I had ever seen was the concord ships patrolling the gates. After I completed one of the SoE arcs, school started up and I had no reason to continue playing. Other games held my interest, and I forgot about playing eve. However I hadn‚Äôt forgotten about it. I still watched YouTube fight compilations, tutorials in PvPing, etc. 
---
One day, when homework was finished quicker than usual, I logged back on. For the first time in a while I found myself back in Eve. His time I went looking for a fight. I wandered my way to the closest lowsec system. Flying my little PvE omen I jumped into system. My very first action was to say ‚ÄúHello!‚Äù Into local. I started up a conversation with someone, and they invited me to join there Corp. I said I would love to, and asked where they were so I could protect them, for they said they were a miner. PvP was completely off my mind, and I was honestly expecting them to tell me where they were, and for nothing else to happen. They have me a belt location, and as I landed on grid no one was there.
---
A Tristan and a Vexor landed on grid. Before I knew it I was pointed and taking damage. I fumbled my safety to orange, and locked them both up. I started taking down the Vexor‚Äôs shields, while my own were failing. For the first time, Eve felt like a game, not a chore. It‚Äôs safe to say I died, I got the Vexor to hull, but I never had a chance. GFs all around, and a minute later I recurved an invite into there Corp. 
---
The next few months I played regularly. I tried my hand at PvP, however I always ran into opponents that outclassed me. My frigates were torn down by faction cruisers. My destroyers lost to groups. Half the time I jumped into the low sec systems I was blapped on the gate. I found that the best fights came from hunting the neuts that wandered into our system. My Corp went on a few kitchen sink roams, but when we went to null we either died to larger groups and ships, or the people we found would always run as soon as they saw the local spike. Null was cool, I could fire without losing sec status! However it was always empty, or a fight was no where to be found.
---
I progressed, my Corp set up a wormhole base, we raided FW systems, we lost and won. I found FW areas where the best places to get fights, as long as you avoided the larger groups flying T3C and faction stuff blinged to the gills.
---
The Triglavian event held my interest for a while, but there was no reward. Ninja salvagers would steal my stuff, and I could never shoot them quick enough. 
---
Then, Null was blacked out. I grabbed a Hecate and decided I mine as well try it. It had changed a lot. Now I never knew that there was a neut that I couldn‚Äôt find, now I couldn‚Äôt tell if there was a fleet with me. It was like a wormhole system, but jumping hate to hate was so much easier than scanning down signatures. For lols, I started attacking structures, territorial claim units, anything I could find. Just warp, blap, warp. My hopes were someone would get a hundred pings that all of their structures were being attacked. I don‚Äôt know if it worked or not, but in a few minutes I ran into a fleet or frigates and destroyers about 5 strong. They had a bubble set up, and I was drawn off the gate right into them. This was probably the most fun fight I had. Neither of us saw each other until I was about to land, and that‚Äôs only do they were spamming D-Scan (which reddit informs me is everyone). My hull tanked blaster Hecate made short work of them. Many were active tank, and they fell that much quicker. I thought that I would be able to take them, but something unexpected happened.
---
In the midst of it all a bomber decloaked and bombed the lot of us. The fight was over just like that. I was already in hull from the fight, and the bomb ended me, the destroyer I was fighting, and the frigate that had tackle on me. I watched amazed as the bomber drew range, and finished off the last destroyer. GFs in local and lols. He had been waiting for their gate camp to catch someone, and I was the unlucky capsulier. None of this would have been the same if I had know there were that many people with me. I don‚Äôt even know if those people would have been there. Out of all of my experiences in eve, flying around in null during the blackout has been on of the best. You better bet I‚Äôm training into a stealth bomber. 
---
Eve has always fascinated me, but all the fascinating stuff seems to never happen where I‚Äôm around. I‚Äôve seen capital fights, but it‚Äôs been a bunch of capitals against my corps ECM frigates or our defense drake fleet. We‚Äôve been bullied by larger blocs, had our structures nuked for lols, and have had people attempting to push us out. I for one always find a bit of joy when large blocs cry foul. For the first time it looks like I‚Äôm going to finally see a lot more action, and really experience Eve. 
---
A note about my play style: I‚Äôm what most people would consider a wallet warrior. I buy $5 of plex every month or so, and use that to fuel my PvP frigates and other small ships for a while. I think it‚Äôs worth the money to avoid the isk grind. If that‚Äôs not the type of person you want to give plex to that‚Äôs fine. I just thought you should know.
---
In addition I think you should know what I plan to do with the plex if I win it. 5,000 plex right now is a bit less than 18-20 TRILLION isk (unless I failed my math spectacularly). If one were to buy that much plex it would cost around $250. There is no way that I would ever be able to amass that much isk or plex. 
---
I‚Äôd probably keep the majority of it in my plex vault, so I don‚Äôt lose it in a horrible accident. Instead of buying $5 of plex every other month I could instead draw out from my new nearly unlimited supply. Would I buy blingier ships? Probably not. I don‚Äôt think that they add that much more fun to the game, and myself would feel horrible losing a frigate worth more than 100M, even if I was a trillionaire. 
---
I admit I would splurge on one thing. You probably don‚Äôt like it, but my one dream sense starting eve has to eventually fly a capital ship. And now more than ever. Our little pocket has been attacked by this group for a while. They hired a group to declare war on us and attack us. We didn‚Äôt know it was them at the time, but we do now. These players are mercenaries essentially. These guys who hired them have deep, deep pockets. Why? None of them grind for it, they aren‚Äôt leaders of large corps, they instead buy plex, and insane amounts of it. They gave the mercenaries blinged out Triglavian ships, and SRPed their losses. We were all over the place, but we constructed a fleet doctrine and got almost all of our 30 or so members that are still active online for the timers. We didn‚Äôt lose a single structure. We thought that was it, but a story of betrayal and lies later we had lost our 2 structures that could support capital ships. Our single rorqual was hot dropped by multiple supers, and our remaining structures were under constant attack by their capital pilots. Though we haven‚Äôt lost a single one to the group who actually wants us out. The other structures were favors they pulled from SF (I believe). How are we fighting back? We have swarms (the 3-4 of us that are online when they come) of ECM frigates that ECM them, and warp off while the structure deals damage. These guys aren‚Äôt smart, they haven‚Äôt brought a sub cap fleet to deal with us, they haven‚Äôt brought actual anti-structure dreads. They‚Äôve just thrown money at the problem. Buying plex (I think RMTing) to find their stupidity. 
---
What does this have to do with the plex and my life long desire to fly to capital? It would cost me a pretty penny, but if I won I would have quite a few. I would spend a few billion skill injecting into a dread or maybe even a titan. I would simply want to be able to put up more of a fight than just annoying them. I want to watch our traitors carrier fall.
---
Another thing I‚Äôve always wanted to do is to fly a HAW dread into null. I‚Äôve seen the videos and I‚Äôve always wanted to do it. With the blackout, this plan would be even more exiting if you ask me. 
---
I have to be honest with myself though, I‚Äôm probably not going to win, and even if I did I probably wouldn‚Äôt splurge so much on capitals ships, they‚Äôre too much work to keep safe, to much work to build, and they would draw too much attention. I‚Äôd probably spend the isk on finding my little roams into null sec. I plan (if I win) to start an open fleet where everyone brings smaller or even larger ships, where I would SRP up to a certain amount.
---
I love Eve, it‚Äôs been my favorite game for a while I live what CCP has added recently, and look forward to the future. I hope I win so I can fund my future null sec roams, and take full advantage of the chaos while I can. 
---
Thank you for doing this, me and probably everyone else is very appreciative. I wish I had a better story, but I‚Äôm sure I will have more as I venture deeper into null. If you choose me, I assure you that the plex would be used to generate actual content. I won‚Äôt let it sit around, I‚Äôd probably splurge more than I said I would. I won‚Äôt fund a bunch of bots or omega a bunch of alts so I can grind. I‚Äôll try and use it to create content for me and anyone else who decides to join. I love helping new bros, and if I win I could afford to. I hope you choose me :P

How can I permanently remove account that I no longer use from launcher? I have already disabled 'remember this account' option, I also tried 'remove this' account. Nothing works, when I restart launcher the account is still there.
---
Then you will LOVE it when they make PvE exciting through risk!
---
The blackout has been very hard for me. NO intel at all...
---
Mostly that was caused by me not logging in my (now Alpha) account...
---
Flair says FEDUP, so high probability they're actually that stupid.
---
If you can do T3s you can do T2s, and sorry but I don't have any alpha fits mate.

This might come in handy for you: https://crossingzebras.com/alpha-clone-fits-part-i-minmatar/amp/

It's probably a little outdated  (I think Alphas can fit more stuff since that was written) but its a good guide and might give you some ideas to work with.

üëè buy üëè more üëè plex

This is the best post ever.
---
Need to start selling my 60bil skin can ... no reason to invest in those :D
---
yea, like 15 mins or so
---
I'm replying in agreement sorry my English is not my first language
---
RNG is too random or what?
---
Like some sort of anti-cap subcap.
---
&gt; I don't think anyone assumed people would be flooding into null after the blackout to change this.
---
No, but the general assumption was that the reason you don't see anyone is that the krabs go into hiding as soon as you show up in local.
---
Sure, people defend their space. Then you can surely see that ccp is discontent with how space is being defended and they are testing out a change now.  
---
No local means that you can't always find your longcoats fast enough, so napoleon might ocassionaly make it to moscow before it is burned down.  
---
That is all that it is about and i find it hard to disagree with.
---
Completely in favour of burning shit just because.
---
"Indefinite" just mean it's not finite, because they haven't set a hard date for any decision since they haven't taken any decision.
---
Hey I'm with you totally on that.  An abuser keeps you in an abusive relationship by showing that glimmer of hope and whispering in your ear "what we have is special baby," cutting you off from everyone else.  I'm terrified that's all this blackout is, before they go back to remorselessly holding us hostage with the memory of how special this game CAN be... while they just totally ruin it.
---
I expect more miners to move back to highsec and afk mine. The safety is attractive to many people. I wonder if compression and exporting to null will be a thing again.
---
We have a learner!!!
---
I about jizzed when I saw cloak pinpoint array
---
Hell yeah. since they want the nullsec to go dark then its only fair for them to get the light turned on 8 )
---
Now i'm confused as well, ahhh.
---
&gt;EVE is a game and it needs to be fun. There need to be 'gud fites,' not just curbstomps. 
---
Can you explain how one-sided ganking is a good fight and not a curbstomp?
---
&gt;Additionally, 'massively superior' only needs to be in numbers and resources currently, not tactics. There isn't a whole lot of strategy or thought behind yeeting capital ships at your opponents until they die.
---
You only see the caps being dropped, not the 24/7 eyes, the spies in other corps, and the cap fc that has to make the decision on whether it is safe to commit. By saying it is a matter of just dropping caps anytime, you are massively downplaying the work that goes into a well-run umbrella.
---
&gt;But I can say that the whole drop-caps-on-everything-that-moves concept is probably not fun for any party involved.
---
You get caps dropped on you because you try and gank people who don't want to pvp or you are roaming in areas that are off-limits for roaming gangs. It isn't meant to be fun for you, it is just defending space.
---
That hull tanked Brutix is going to be so dank.
---
Noone ever said local was the only problem here, don't be stupid.
---
And Mutaplasmids where always a REALLY shitty introduction to the game, whoever pushed for it should be fired.
---
You are very much correct dude, my part was just to point out that there were in fact people coming back for this along with those "quitting".
---
I know numbers are down but my guess would be that this is just folk throwing the dummy out of the pram and that once they calm down, they'll be back. People invest too much I this game for them to simply quit like that (anecdotal again, but I know this first hand as someone who has "quit" on multiple occasions)
---
This was fit into a Titan
---
&gt;I know corps whose fleet comps all cost 300-600mil and they have no SRP.
---
Man those are some cheap comps. In my current wh group, we tend to be in the 1.2bil-1.5bil range with no SRP. When it's likely you're going to fight outnumbered, gotta bring out the bling. Most people in the corp are credit card warriors or have C6 farmholes and make north of 1-1.5Bil ISK/hr.
---
But why should it be scary?
---
This is assuming bots can‚Äôt be adapted to Dscan
---
On July 13th 01:57 GMT, our corporation performed a joint security / moon mining operation in VV-VCR.  The security team was responsible for performing interdiction security on II- and M2- gates using small and medium bubbles.  We placed small and medium bubbles around the mining site assist in catching incoming bad guys.  All things were going pretty smooth,  the security team was keeping and providing intelligence to our mining team using DSCAN.  In significant targets of opportunity would traverse the solar system, and we would call out over coms what we saw.  After hours of standing watch, we heard across coms, "Proteus on long scan", then "Proteus on short scan", then "Proteus no longer on scan".  The corp mates sitting on gate were voicing, "Is he still in system?", one corp mate, explained, "No, he has not jumped", another yelled out, "No gate activation on II-, and another corp mate spoke up and said, nothing on M2- either".  We were all on edge.  Constantly spamming DSCAN to mitigate a surprise attack.  This intensity over coms last for about 20 mins....as we began to think he must have logged or slipped by us... we slowly returned to our posts, waiting, spamming DSCAN.... Shortly there after, coms blows up, a corp mate yelled out, "Proteus on grid!!", "Proteus on grid!!", "I'm warp scrammed!!, Warp in on me!!"  Little did this poor Proteus pilot know we had a man in the station.  Manning our neutralizers, webber array, and XL Torpedoes.  Tackle came in from the gates.   I warped into one of the bubbles protecting the operation.... unable to perform my duty, but no matter.  The Proteus's cap was gone...  He was was locked down by my team mates, and shortly became the victim of wrathful corp whom has been standing on edge all afternoon. It didn't take too long to blown the Proteus to smithereens... all was calm, no cyno, no trap, intel from our mates in II- and M2- acknowledged, "DSCAN is clear, repeat, DSCAN is clear!" Shortly there after, we saw local blink.... "How in the hell did that station lock me so fast!".... nothing but silence was returned.... blackout.

---
First, it will die and it will die soon, due to you making some dumb mistake you never knew was a mistake. Just assume it's dead the moment you get into the super.
---
Second, you can do similar things with less risk by dropping on subcaps in a hypered Thanatos/Nidhoggur - and for learning how to do it I'd highly suggest going that way. Said carriers will die and will probably die quite often, but it will still be valuable lesson given most of the stuff that will cause those carriers to die will also cause a super to die. Same lessons, much cheaper to execute. Also using a carrier is a bit easier than using a super, so it is valuable stepping stone, and - thanks to insurance - quite affordable.
---
After you get about 50 or so successful drops and will have to resupply few times, you should be able to answer all your other questions on your own (including realizing why using carriers to resupply is terrible idea) and will likely get in contact with other people doing similar things, you could then ask more specific questions. Good luck and have fun.
---
I guess ... whats changed since then? Are there still active wars? I would assume the huge alliances are still around. Whats the drama as of late?
---
REE Online
---
you don't have to incorrectly wonder, i'll tell you: ccp buffed the shit out of nullsec, neglected high sec and the playerbase dropped.
---
the shift from high/low -&gt; null made null feel okay when the game shedded 100k players over 2 years
---
I disagree this is a problem. In other games where you have more control over your PVP engagement parameters, maybe. In eve this is just as likely to be OP as shit as it is a falcon uncloaks, jams you, and you just sit there and die.
---
So.. Seems you know what you're talking about just a couple of questions.
---
Why do you say blackout = less botters?
---
And
---
It's great that this will make the market great again but surely that will only last as long as the blackout does?
---
But it‚Äôs the only ‚Äúsolution‚Äù being offered.  
---
There‚Äôs many shitty things ccp have done here and mutas are probably barely in the top 10.  
---
But let‚Äôs kill local instead
---
&gt;I look like a dumbass b/c I'm a sperg and took your comment way out of context b/c I have a pre-disposed grr goon mentality but it's totally your fault
---
That hull tanked Erebus is going to be so dank.
---
Structure doesn't last very long on a titan
---
lol stop talking into a mirror
---
But telling players that this is a test / limited period allows for player manipulation, example:
---
I don't want local cause I can't rat without it, so I and all my friends log out &amp; unsub for the duration cause we know its "just a test". This would obscure your data of logins / active accounts for the duration no?
---
Don't be shocked if it actually turns out this way. They are thinking totally in terms of increasing number of new players and totally giving the shaft to their veteran loyal clients, especially the heritage ones that have been around more than 10 years.
---
Oh yea, that's what i meant. That you were agreeing and that you then were misunderstood. 
---
Your english is fine don't worry.
---
Ouch
---
let's not pretend you know exactly what you've been trying to do on reddit and the sole reason you made this account
---
Where did you source the music?
---
Faction scrams and webs on EVERY SHIP.
---
They all sound like appropriate names for a penis.
---
Yes titan structure is generally the hardest toughest part to get through.
---
Wait no it's not.
---
Imagine if you could anchor a structure that would disable local-chat
---
 wherever legacy is you can usually find fights, right now its catch. just look for dudes belt ratting or in anomalies, don't know if your rifter can handle the cruisers people rat with though....
---
"Unites all of nullsec"
---
Lol, you wish. If anything, nullsec seems to be united on the other side of the argument. 
---
TL;DR - Fuck off krab.
---
KOTH Fluf was a good guy
---
yeah exactly. We didn't have the means to deal with him. I usually bring a kiki that can pack a punch in them
---
I wonder if those same players are reporting you
---
just use filters like CCP intended
---
MaKeEvErIsKyAgAiN
---
Could make it so you also lose 25mb per stab. That'll screw over the botters. Could also impact caps and supers in the same way but for fighters.
---
Structure don't change much on capital, it is mostly for subcap.        
---
If you actually did fit this on the titan ... that was not smart idea .        
---
Depending on your titan type you are looking at the shield/armor bonus DC gives.
---
Came back about 6 weeks ago after a few years off.  I extracted out two old 2003 mains after spending a couple hundred on extractors.
---
I've got a little over 1,000 Large Injectors spread over my remaining 15 accounts.
---
Bob has fed well off me, and my money tank.
---
I still won't buy those crazy-ass expensive modules for a 1% gain.
---
If you think CCP caters to Reddit idk what to tell you with the glaring problems this game has that Reddit has moaned loud about therefore you're objectively wrong, dork.
---
I solo low sec incursions with 15 accounts and I multibox FW for most of my isk. Doesn't really affect those particular activities but I keep them semi-interesting through keeping active managing the accounts.
---
But Reed, I want to be just like you when I grow up! 
---
Thanks for your take on the market. I always enjoy reading what others are speculating!
---
Delete jita!
---
The funny thing though is he can do all of that and still be correct in his over-all predictions.
---
I have always found it amusing goons drop on everything in ONE REGION. They should make it so goons dont exist in the game.
---
 I know literally everyone's going to upvote this into existence, but I think it could kill the game.
---
Some of those people still play and teach the dscan to newcomers. If you ever had the luck of having live dscan hunting training from one of nullsec oldtimers, you're lucky person (and likely to be good hunter thanks to that).
---
I‚Äôve used the same argument.
---
Nope! I'm just busy with classes and such ATM. I'm making REvernus in my spare time, and as I had to unexpectedly return to college early this summer, progress has been a bit slow. Sorry!
---
&gt;longtime paying players 
---
You misspelled "bots"... also carebears that can adapt to the changes (and probably make more money as a result, with the bots cleared out for a bit) or leave, and if they want to leave because they can't stand needing to do more than afk rat, then good riddance
---
????????
---
&gt; the amount of resources needed does a poor job in limiting numbers
---
Keepstar resources x100 wouldn‚Äôt put maybe a little bit of a dent in the number of them?

Live in wormhole, literally nothing changed
---
/r/sixwordstories/
---
Omg your awesome! Thanks so much!
---
Since evernus is like ms excel, what is the first feature you plan to put in?
---
For me the margin tool and order tracking is most important!
---
Still need more specificity, since when? 
---
Wardecs got an overhaul recently, you now cannot wardec a corp with no structures. When declaring a wardec you have to declare one of your structures in hisec as your war hq, if it dies the war ends. 
---
NCPL is lookin a little worse for wear, Test is still around and goons are still around.
---
&gt;Whats the drama as of late?
---
[The Blackout.](https://www.eveonline.com/article/puj0c3/nullsec-local-blackout-in-effect?origin=launcher)
---
Please, when has stainguy never been the reasonable voice of change?
---
This is just a small list that jumps to mind. I am not saying if I agree/disagree with them, just a list of things nerfed in recent memory that heavily impacted Null Sec players.
---
* Jump fatigue introduced. Back and forth and back again.
---
* Raised rates of wormhole connects to nullsec for more content.
---
* Rorqual mining nerf 1 through 4.
---
* Rorqual tank nerf by 50 %.
---
* Nerf to carrier/super damage output, 3-4 times.
---
* Nerf to carrier/super application, 3-4 times.
---
* Nerf to carrier/super missile volley.
---
* Repeated nerf/fine tuning of rat AI to target fighters.
---
* Release of implants that boosted drone/fighter damage and then nerfed to be drone only.
---
* Nerf to respawn rates of ore anomalies.
---
* Nerf to respawn rate of ratting anomalies. 2-3 times.
---
* Titan HAW damage cut by 1/2.  
---
* FAX rep nerfs a few times.
---
* FAX rep stacking penalties.
---
Dude, I literally asked you if you had ever seen ccp publish the numbers...
---
That‚Äôs a bit of an analysis... people will always krab. The ticks might be slightly less but in eve you have to always make a choice. Max ticks or defensive capabilities.
---
A little defensive...
---
What nullsec alliances/corps offer most "content"? Like, you log in and there's always some fleets, roams going on.
---
 one thing that helps as a guide if you can't find anything else is the mastery tab on ship info. it's not a bible by any means, but it is how I recently discovered I didn't have enough shield skills on my 32 mil sp toon....... I will be reconciling that with either my next alpha booster or when I can actually afford to resub.
---
TIL no local = one ultra giant blue donut &amp; inflation that would make Zimbabwe blush
---
Is it sad when you can recognize a Tableau product right away?
---
Also, FWIW check out Tableau prep. Its great for getting the data all sparkly clean.
---
What if he lives in New Jersey? You could be condemning a man to death.
---
I can tell you what I do:
---
I have 6 accounts on a yearly sub, 6 on 3-mo, and 3 on monthly.
---
My monthly EVE budget is $200 for PLEX.  Haven't been spending that lately, as I've burned down to old 150M SP mains after buying $500 of extractors.
---
I fly around looking for solo PvP, and lose a lot of ships getting back into EVE.  That's pretty much my play style as a smaller whale.
---
I rarely look at cost when buying shit anymore, and will buy and fit out 4-5 Loki's at a time @ 900M/ea for a night of PvP fun.
---
Post is long as fuck. But one of the better ones of the last two weeks of REEE.
---
You aren‚Äôt Steel Roamer?
---
tell me your secrets meta
---
No I‚Äôm not
---
These have absolutely been in there since the beginning - they added named placeholders for every structure they mentioned having ideas for at the same time, a few months before Citadel. I remember seeing them all in the files myself way back when &amp; being excited for a second until I realized they were, again, placeholders :P
---
Or be amazing, if he can update orders every 5 minutes whilst he is meant to be working then he is essentially getting paid to play eve
---
Oh, you might be right. Come to think of it, if lvl 4 missions were put under Omega wall, then t5 abyssals should be also under the Omega wall
---
Uh? He's double web TD. Okay, so we're assuming honor tackle on everything, while he can fit a scram? So the firetail is double web missile disrupting? Even then I don't think you can deal with him if he loads faction.
---
What pulse ship can control range and apply at 10km against two webs and a TD?
---
Double web rail comet loses, double web blaster comet PROBABLY takes too long to apply before it gets burned down. You're adjusting range VERY slowly there and you're still tracking disrupted. Even then he can warp out.
---
stole it from tractors
---
Oh, thought you were. I‚Äôve been fooled. You post very similar to him.
---
Concerning
---
When I was 4 - I saw a hornet building a nest in one of my Batman-Bigwheel ( ‚Ñ¢ ) seat pegs.  
---
I wanted to ride irrespective of what stupid flying bug was living in my trike, so I started waddling over to it. My dad - who was tending to some yard work nearby and was always an advocate of "teach by experience" simply said "I wouldn't if I was you..."  
---
So of course I did, and got a bunch of hornet stings on my butt, and a fear of hornets/wasps/bees that lasted a decade.
---
That attitude from the krabs is what has killed the game and CCP's bottom line, and they're doing this because their company is in panic mode right now. Changes made in favour of pvp are going to bring players to the game, because afk krabbing doesn't sell. PVP sells. Look at the market in online gaming in the past five years. Has a single pve game grossed over a billion dollars?
---
Oh look another game no one plays in 2019.
---
Mmm. Salt. Delish.
---
Can it please be permanent? I would really like null to unspodbrain itself, so that the hisec economy can regain some health and we can get some fuckin player retention.
---
This is just the tip
---
Currently, I'm implementing order updating, then planning on doing Market Analysis, then I'm going to make a public alpha release. I'm doing it in this order because there's a lot of groundwork that needs to be laid out in the app, like how to handle and use static data, "job" progress notifications, where certain things should be located, how hotkeys will work, etc, and those two tabs should give me a good guide as to what I need to add. I can work on the Margin Tool for ya and try and get it included in that public release too! It shouldn't be too hard given I've worked with eve's finicky text file exporting crap before, haha
---
Isn't that what having local created?
---
Wow. TIL.
---
Rather than join in on the self-stroking and empty brags, let me tell you what I would do with your PLEX were I to win it. 
---
I would split it into stacks of 50, load each stack into a frigate and undock them one-by-one from Jita 4-4 for everyone's amusement. 
---
Because this game died and dumping PLEX in space for the people who haven't figured that out yet sounds fun.
---
You know, I already know dis
---
You don't actually play this game, do you?
---
No, no, it was the drifter thing null was pissed about.
---
The local thing is pretty okay alright.
---
Haha.. Move to highsec if u dont like it.. Blackout for ever #ccplease
---
Wonder how long this sale will go on
---
I'm upvoting anyone who includes a TLDR.
---
I agree, I‚Äôve gotten more fights mining in my rorqual in the past few days then in a year previous.
---
Have you noticed that 80% of the people bitching about no local are sockpuppet accounts?          
---
That amuses me.
---
Those signs should be swapped 100%
---
Its amazing to me how many people don't. What i'd like to do is figure out how to make a custom map and then plot the datapoints to it but :effort:
---
So quit (again) and join the majority of people who are fed up with ccp making a shitty game.  
---
Seriously more people have quit this game in frustration than who remains ‚Äúemployed‚Äù.
---
is it really that much of a shock
---
It's the only big change so far, that's evident; but to be honest is far more significant and bold than anything anyone expected, so props to them for that.
---
And besides, what where you expecting? For them to suddenly fix every problem and introduce significant changes to all areas of the game in a single patch?
---
If the answer is "yes", you are a moron and I'm wasting my time here; if you are realistic enough to realize that would be fucking retarded to expect, just sit tight and wait to see what else they have in store with their new "fuck it" policy. 
---
For starters, there's already hints of new modules/services/structures that will probably rebalance local again somehow.
---
I know, you can't krab and are getting anxious, but calm down buddy, this is just begining.
---
TL;DR: "Thank you CCP for making it even easier to get those already easy kills. The elites and I thank you!"
---
No, not really.
---
The only thing that annoys me in this image is that the percentages are negative.
---
I‚Äôll present another datapoint for them - the accounts who claimed the last SP events vs ones who don‚Äôt bother with this one.
---
I'm the only dude I know using it atm but I find it both easy to use and understand.
---
Even with the latest release with custom ODBC I still struggle with an iseries DB2 source.  
---
Just built an Eve dashboard, I'll share it in a mo
---
Both the doubleweb comet and firetail should be faster and even if they're the same speed you need to be faster than someone to orbit them while they're going a straight line. The tracking disruptor is only 30-40%
---
Just having a web as a pulse ship like an imp slicer or coercer and being at range of about 10k is enough to apply enough dps to get the kill. In one of the fights in the vid I'm forced to warp off at like 10% hull when an imp slicer does exactly that.
---
mikal you need help my son
---
It gives too much defensive power to the null blocs. If ratters have local, they will go back to warping out the instant someone pops up in local, but those hunting will need to warp around to find someone on d-scan or drop probes. Especially in larger systems. IMO, intel should be an active part of the game, not something that is just given to you like it is now and structures aren't active.
---
I like the blackout, but people still need time to adjust to it. At the very least, delayed local where you don't show for several minutes would be better than the instant local now. Those roaming can still be hidden so long as they don't stand still for too long.
---
Moving away from system chat to constellation or region chat for null would help alleviate the free intel that local gives.
---
Imo, moving most statistics from system based to constellation based would remove most of the free intel that people get. Add a delay to it and I think null would be just about as safe as it was before without gimping small roaming gangs. People know where to look, but not exactly where to go.
---
Constellation or region wide intel would give pilots a warning system to be more vigilant, but not the same as local where a nuet would pretty much mean warp-out immediately.
---
Gay.

Awesome! Be agility my friend, small pieces of content win!

I appreciate you. I'll be patently waiting.

I knew I saw these names before

This roughly brings back the low skill point or new pilots role in the game to run these small shops in the first place in numbers.

Great post.

Quality copypasta XD i love it

the only way to perfectly execute highsec is with the lethal injection
---
Old news.
---
I did it, the wrong Aussie appeared on teamspeak though. How do I unsummon Edooty??
---
I might be wrong/it depends on exact fits but I'm pretty sure a nosprey will not kill a jaguar in 1 clip. It's fine if you have additional dps, but a single nosprey isn't enough, particularly if you have fury or em damage loaded
---
On the ingame map, the capital jump ranges display a bubble that extends around a perimeter of systems they can jump into.  
---
This bubble is given the term umbrella to imply its coverage is synonymous with the way a real irl umbrella protects those under the perimeter from a maximum amount of precipitation.  
---
Alliances use this bubble of protection to build their empires around.  The degree to which alliances can flex and shift their bubbles around their space without penalty of fatigue also creates zones of coverage.
---
What exactly is the Omega upgrade and is it absolutely necessary to get access to planetary production?
---
This. If microgang mechanics were a scaled down version of how real fleet pvp worked, large scale pvp would be fun.
---
You know what you're talking about, and that's very rare for this sub. Thanks for the good post.
---
Perhaps this?
---
That's what growing up with Amiga500 and Frontier does to you
---
Well yeah, they're almost entirely bots...
---
&gt; They aren't even IN frat anymore, they got FUCKING KICKED.
---
we never were in frat in the fist place, not attending their fleets, not dealing with paps and doing pretty much exclusively our own fleets was the bedrock of the deal. We went down there to shoot people and that's it. We went to one frat fleet after they took in dop/p3ak/kyr but we soon realized why we decided not to deal with shit on that scale anymore. 
---
And where did you get that we got kicked? we started moving back to ls the day we got news about the direction frat was taking with drones and other china, out of our own accord for several reasons, pretty much all of them content related as it gets tiring fighting just AFs and t3ds for 2 months straight, getting all your gangs, regardless of size, dropped by tapi caps outside of detorid. Also the inevitable lower availability of shit in the o3 market and targets in omist.
---
this is you right? https://zkillboard.com/kill/77362762/
---
If you want an honor brawl you ask for an honor brawl like we do in lowsec, if you wanna small gang like the big bois you don't complain when you fuck up. I can't even begin to explain how much of a bad idea it is to go into a staging dead end system and put an anchorable bubble on the gate, both in you surviving and in the kind of reaction it will attract, especially when there are cloaky campers 23/7 in there(even if they're monumentally shit, eg https://zkillboard.com/kill/76885281/).

And how will the bots tell if it‚Äôs friendly or not?

Using dscan to be safe is not remotely as effective as using local.
---
Does npcs ships in Abyssal sites counts towards the event?
---
Ili like how the ratter needs to put in as much effort as the hunter. No more ‚Äúi undock dur, shoot at rock dur, I tackle dur, I light cyno and panic dur, umbrella saves me dur, shoot at rock dur‚Äù. PvP is the core mechanic for eve. If you want that juicy spod, you‚Äôre gonna have to fight for it on a unbroken playing field.

mutaplasmids should apply to anomalies and missions, not modules

instead of poe items, make anoms/missions poe maps

They won‚Äôt but if they‚Äôre in a quiet enough system it won‚Äôt matter that much anyway.
---
 I'm literally in the same boat as you. I'm currently debating whether I should  try some new types of gameplay while trying to figure things out myself, or if I should just give in and rejoin test and have someone tell me everything i need to know.
---
We had this off of our home hole once. It was an incoming nullsec wh but it could only fit medium ships and according to google it should only be able to appear in c1s. That was the first and only time ive seen it until this picture.
---
How is this a nerf?
---
Ded Panther-pilot here, 
---
yes mistakes were made. Piloting ones on my end, communication will be better next time.
---
Imperfect information, makes you take fights you otherwise would not take, because that would be risky. But the result? Serious PvP-shakes, like back in ye olden days. 
---
I on my and had fun regardless the outcome, which is what really counts at the end of the day.
---
Thanks to everyone who goes out to fight.
---
They‚Äôre not gonna be able to see that cloaky tengu get close to them. Even if they have another bot on a gate, they‚Äôll never know when the person has left system. Botting in nullsec just went from really easy to extremely hard.

You can also counter play warp disruption by not undocking too. Don't think those are necessarily acceptable answers. Most people don't accept "Git Gud" "L2P" as acceptable answers for counter play.
---
A webbing pulse slicer was able to dps race you? Interesting.
---
I guess honor tackle will be the new normal, because it starts to balance out the rocket meta and the other people using honor tackle.
---
Yes but as always they‚Äôll adapt.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs not the size that matters only the duration
---
Yeah, they removed the captains quarters when they changed the shader engine and such. API is now done through ESI Single Sign On so it's now character-unique and tells you what that service is requesting.
---
The recruiting section of the forums is pretty good, but if you're looking for a specific playstyle your best bet is to just start going around doing that, find a group that seems like good people, and join up with them that way. What are you looking for?
---
But it doesn't really change anything, to carry on this god awful metaphor that I now regret making, Russia has no problem defending itself in the no longcoat era however Luxembourg and the smaller surrounding states are fuuuucked
---
 or do the career(tutorial) missions for the faction you have low standings with to get standings up
---
There's already a much greater risk to doing anything solo in eve so I don't see the argument there.
---
Stop crying and git gud. Why must you harvest at a game breaking rate the rarest of the rare items at the safeties possible settings? Problem is you people are too custom to having it so easy. Now that would have to put in effort and there is risk, you cry about it like children.
---
I understand that, but it‚Äôs not going to be the same, It‚Äôs not going to be as profitable and it‚Äôs not going to be as easy. 
---
If you can‚Äôt see this is a good thing for the game, idk how to change your mind.
---
Just the elites being elite...
---
Nosprey should be defaulting kinetic since heavy tackle rarely has high kinetic resists and it gets the bigger bonus. Even then no, you're not going to one clip a ram jag. The changes to RLMLs over the past two years have been a massive kick in the balls for antitackle.
---
He will die, but not super duper fast. He will definitely get all his asb charges out vs 1 kiki
---
Because none of us who play other styles have been in Null blocks and participated in their wars. No, everyone knows wormholers just pop out of anomalies, fully skilled and already bitter.
---
This, now this is a quality shitpost.

&gt; Good attitude. We were fully expecting to get dropped by whose Wombat dudes, but it never happened. I don't know if something went wring on their side, or they never intended to escalate to caps or what, but I'm glad either way and they still beat us in an even fight.
---
A lot of us have had plenty of experience with our supers but it's more fun to stand and deliver in subcaps than to just bag a cruiser with your Nyx or Hel and shoo off the rest of the gang.
---
Just do some super ratting on sisi and get used to the retarded fighter mechanics, flying a drive-by super is really quite easy. The main skill to it is feeling out a bait attempt, which just comes from experience flying anything.
---
Solo carriers, blops, etc are quite similar if you want to practice those first.
---
&gt; or mostly krabbers that are crying about this since they can mine in peace
---
I think it's mostly this combined with a few people with decent arguments. The thing is, we have no precedent for how this will affect the game, so all arguments for or against are guesses.
---
In any case, this will shake things up a bit, and that's good enough for me.
---
Yes life sucks when you have free time and get paid while at the same time playing a game.
---
I am required to sso login to apply for corp. How can I revoke that if i wont be accepted?
---
^^^ defeats the purpose. The problem is instant, accurate intel gathered by doing little to nothing. And this applies to both sides offensive and defensive. When both sides know exactly what‚Äôs happening there is very little chance for emergent gameplay to occur. 
---
This is why stagnation started to happen in the first place. By the way Discord bots we run together with Zkillboard integration give us effectively full visibility into enemy movement and thereby can always deny fight no matter what. This is wrong. Surprise, fear and uncertainty must be incorporated back into the game.

&gt;The meta really hasn't changed no matter how much you pretend it has.  
---
Insane. The only change between last week and this week is the removal of local chat. Not the removal of intel networks, or scouts, or a nerf to Myrmidons, or a nerf to excavators. Only the removal of local chat.
---
Imagine playing the game so safe **specifically only because you can scrape local immediately to know when someone comes in system even while physically away from your computer** that you refuse to play unless you can use your third party software to gain an advantage over other players.
---
You're right, the meta hasn't changed, but player behavior has - and it's incredible.
---
Holy shit that daily economy talk YouTube guy left highsec?
---
This is a huge milestone
---
Lowsec or high sec. STick with whichever you find is more suitable for your risk averse gamestyle. 0.0 is dangerous, not safe - yet there are still areas in the game suitable for everyone, solo, groups, pve, pvp, whichever tickles your fancy. Only now rewards scale with the risk.
---
Prior to the blackout my corp was just another grain in the nullsec desert. We were part of a huge alliance and were comfortable. We krabbed all day, ratted all night, and flew CTAs on weekends. Unfortunately the  so called "high life" left my corp somewhat fractured. People tended to exist in small groups, not so much cliques, more as operational bands. Some people mined together. Some ratted. Some flew roams. Some participated in alliance fleets. However, few ever seemed to fly together. Yes, we flew in the same fleets, but comms often felt deadened. People did not talk much and if they did talk it was to a few specific pilots who they spent all their time with. Corp felt stagnant. I was able to PLEX 8 accounts a month, but without a strong corp culture I began to question if EVE was still the game for me. 
---
This all changed when the ~~fire nation attacked~~  blackout happened. Corp leadership began prepping a week in advance. We got ships and fits brought down from Jita. People speculated openly and repeatedly. Plans were made and real life schedules amended. Conversation flowed and these little operational bands began to meld together (like the Mind Flayer in Stranger Things S3) once more. The the blackout hit TQ and for 72 continuous, glorious, hours my corp really flew together for the first time in months. We easily had 20-24 individuals on comms at a given moment. We setup impromptu gate camps and squabbled over silly fits. We unleashed a tide of bait into Esoteria and ship spun waiting for the call to drop. Even while we waited we ran other fleets. We held 8+ hour blops fleets across New Eden and racked up tens of billions of isk in KMs. People willingly stepped up to learn new aspects of the game regardless of their past experiences. I myself tried out hunting. Even though I was not successful, I had alot of fun. I play EVE for the people in my corp. The pixels are nice, sure, but the people make the game. Come monday my corp felt like it had been reborn. People were on comms talking to each other. Pilots didnt seem to be isolated as they once were. I know it is now Tuesday and there is plenty of time yet left, but I hope this trend continues. 
---
I am an unabashed Carebear, but with the safety of Legacy Co. I forgot why I play EVE. ISK and PLEX became idols in my heart where love for ones corp once reigned. Now, I remember why I play EVE, not for the isk, not for the plex, but for the *people*.
---
CUT GANG CUT GANG
---
Okay, I'm not sure which side are the screeching carebears here, maybe you should just evict each other and see what happens
---
How many words can you read per minute? I might want to sync this up to a song
---
I would submit that EvE registering these kinds of numbers is probably far better than we ever could have hoped for. All of those players probably don't have their 12 rorq alts logged in atm, so those numbers are probably far more indicative of actual player numbers than any other numbers we've seen in the last 5 years. I would posit that 28000 players on 30000 accounts is a far healthier number than 20000 on 30000 accounts.
---
He didn't say only logins but even you can't be stupid enough to understand that lower logins is information about the blackout and by encouraging people to login for rewards will manipulate the data.
---
Don't worry, the botters are just digging for everything they can to make this patch look bad.
---
That does look pretty accurate tbh.
---
Yeah, no. You don't have more ganked people in HS than in NS. 
---
And even if you did, you'd have to account for the huge difference in population between the two regions.

It matters not to the accountants whether its Krabs or PVP pilots all they care about  is actual or projected cash flow. They only look at the bottom line will the business continue to make money and earn a return for investors/owners over the medium to long term. The number of subs lost compared to subs gained either negative or positive interests them more than gud fights and arguments over Krabs and bots. If the subs are up then it stays either right away or after a short review period if they are down it goes or they bring in an upwell mod to return local in surrounding systems cash flow is everything.
---
That is almost certainly the point.

They legitimately exist.. in droves.

Yesterday I went roaming in pandemic horde space with my brand new Loki. I took a way through lowsec, killed one ship, and headed over to null to do some killing. Usually, the space would be undefended, so I attacked a mining fleet. I will admit, it was harder to find targets and I generally suck at PvP, but this was the first time I was actually happy to lose a ship. I attacked the barges, and before I could even get one things started warping to the site. I warp off, try to cloak but there is already a defending fleet ready to kill me, and they did. I have never had this happen, so hopefully it's a sign of healthy change for the game. Praise bob!
---
I guess I'm somewhere in between
---
Being an accountant I can assure you they‚Äôll measure and compare every datapoint that they possibly can.  
---
Player sentiment is huge as it predicts behavior and thus can model future cash flows and income streams.

Exactly

Can't decide to downvote because mikalposting or upvote for a good meme
---
TBF the only way you or your corp/alliance should know what's in a system as far as collidables, citadels, moons and ore, is if someone goes into that system and scans all of it.  That info should be kept in game somewhere.  If a system wasn't scanned, the info gets old until it's scanned again.  Knowing what system has changed hands, which SOV was lost, how many citadels or what staging system alliance "X" has should be scouted and scanned.  
---
However, if alliance "X" wishes to sell or give that information to alliance "Y" (or maybe provide old information for nefarious purposes perhaps?) that should occur as well.  That any player can see down to the number of pilots in game a corp has gained or lost is too much information.  If some  entity wants that much detail they should old skool spy for it like back in the day - not go to dotlan and grab it anytime they want.

Not at all related to the blackout, but my 'best moment' in PvP, back in 2011:
---
Living in Cloud Ring.  We were running anomalies in our pocket of space for the ISKies, until a solo red in a Hurricane rolls closer to us in intel.  We safe up to see if they're just passing through, but after a few minutes it's clear they're doing circuits of our area hunting, so we form up a few guys to chase them out.  I grab my Pilgrim, and we start posting up on gates, seeing if we can get a fight.  I find the guy sitting at a tac on a gate, and manage to get out to them cloaked.  
---
I pounce, and hit 'em with everything -- neuts, tracking disruption, drones, cyno.  
---
Wait, Cyno?
---
Shit.
---
So, that's how I died in my Pilgrim to a Hurricane.  Corpmates got the kill, so... there's that.
---
No you just expect everyone to fight you with 5 guys on your hole and just give you kills, or you just gank krabs, such deep gameplay you have.
---
There are a few different uses of the term, but in this context it'd basically be having a few Reddit alt accounts agreeing with yourself in a conversation, to build an overall false picture of consensus.
---
If you really want to use it, despite every other blops being better.
---
Ignore its ECM bonuses, fit full tank and DPS. You can have an MJD, Scram, grapple, web, target painter and a tank with all those mids. And pump over 1k dps with Torps.
---
4-C up there in 2015... good times!
---
Fuck IKR. To 0.0 nonetheless. He never does that. 
---
Sometimes he does lowsec and low class wormholes. but those are deader than my grandpa.
---

---
Can you tell me where this titan is parked that has this on it? I'd like to see it with my own eyes.
---
absolutely agree. Having resources spawn faster the more you extract them makes NO sense at all.

---
I didn't know the terminology, but it's pretty evident that it  happens in a lot of these posts.  
---
It's Eve players though, what else should we expect?
---
TL;DR battles not dynamic enough caps too stronk against sub caps should have anti structure role
---
&gt; That paints an interesting picture
---
No it doesn't.  It's a data point.  You need more than one point to draw a line, let alone paint a picture.
---
What % of that 4000-5000 was botters?
---
CCP has culled 6,000+ botter accounts in the past, at one time, so having 4,000-5,000 botters not logging in is pretty realisitic.
---
Most of those are hardly nullsec exclusive. And is it really a nerf if it is just dialing back excessive buffs?
---
50 vs 5 is....a mistake man.

Always was a fan of the EOS :)
---
In his defense, most bait doesn't know it's bait...
---
I resubbed for the same reason, but I read the terms of the blackout.  If you're mad because you didn't read the terms, that's  your fault - not CCP's.
---
CEO of Beans or in spirit? What‚Äôs in spirit. English is not my first language sry friend.
---
Delve doesn't exist, Goons don't exist. It's a conspiracy by them. I don't know what the purpose behind that is, but I'm willing to get to the bottom of this conspiracy,
---
Go read the whole thing ffs
---
Agreed, but that's u fortunate.
---
Hopefully CCP somehow restricts these new Upwell structures so that only one can be deployed per constellation or region for that matter. 
---
A simple isk paywall would just make the crabs go crabbing some more and then deploy these everywhere. Maybe drifters will constantly attack them, but actually destroy then instead of this bullshit 3-tier invulnerability structure tickling...
---
Let's hope u/CCP_Falcon realizes this!!!
---
I agree proper data collection and analysis is vital in cash flow projection, player sentiment and retention is of course a good indicator of likely business growth which is why I mention new/resubs. We need to accept that comments on Reddit may not be the strongest data point to base any worthwhile projections on, rather the actual figures available to CCP on those leaving the game compared to those returning or joining will be a stronger basis for any analysis over the short to medium term. I submit then that more join/return it is likely the blackout stays in one form or another if more leave than join/return it is likely to be removed I welcome any comments you may have.
---
that's it, TEST can never join GOTG now.
---
How many of those are bots or alts of people that tend to mass multi-box?  I would imagine most.  I do not see a problem with either of those populations decreasing, and I have 9 accounts myself.
---
I miss the old days period. Such is life as you get older, pining for the Good Ol' Days‚Ñ¢ . Would very much welcome a big shake up to LS one day though :)
---
&gt; we only care how much your killmail is worth.
---
Some of us don't even give a fuck about that, we just want the kill.
---
Oh, no I‚Äôm not CEO.
---
&gt; The actual pvp is a by product of bumping into each other on a gate by accident.
---
Which local basically diminishes greatly and leads to less content.
---
I would point out one item.  Perhaps CCP just manipulates the markets in front of us.  Why would they want Plex to drop in price.  Much better to sell to people when it's valuable.  We are starting to see these type of kills now.  Eve removing plex from game:

No, you'd be forced to go find another job (alliance) that suits your needs.

Please enlighten me... Then I will tell you why your reasons are laughably horrible.
---
All this is true - Tribe was in Period Basis and for a short while were best bro's during the Fountain war with TEST and was part of the HBC.  They did get kicked out of Period Basis after the Fountain War and tried to move to Curse I believe and the Russians intercepted them before they could move in, they disbanded.   Some of the same corps then reunited under the Drone Walkers banner - again aligned with TEST in Catch a few years ago.  I think Drone Walkers are still around in some minor sense but that's about it.
---
Oh noes? they're around 25% better than a T2 one?
---
so removing local chat removed a stepping stone for players on the way to flying capitals.
---
nice. that makes sense. totally not a rationalization for advocating safer nullsec through the use of local scraping software. hopefully anyone unsubbing because they can't use near2 fuck off forever.
---
Not if that time apply to all jobs.
---
I'm sorry change those hot pockets to Kirkland Brand Protein Bars
---
Yeah and it wont be muddied by login rewards of free SP and offers on subtime at all....
---
Roamer is the real ceo
---
Local scraping software wasn't that useful. I don't need to know what's 5j out in less it's in the same system as me, it's irrelevant.
---
Hey falcon I‚Äôm part of shoot first and I hope you don‚Äôt take out local. We had over 30 kills yesterday in hemitar lots of fun.  Only complaint we have about lowest is lack of context in us timezone, and capitals.  Certain group like dhsj will always drop capitals. Taking out cynos in low or making it so you can‚Äôt drop combat capitals would really change how low sec works
---
It's pretty popular. Kelavala is a hell of a lot of fun right now.  We've had Goon supers try to drop on ships in staging, not realizing we had a massive response fleet just enter system. On the counterplay, goons managed to kill 24B of our capitals with an awoxer cyno and a hurricane fleet without losing a ship. I don't know why anyone would be complaining. This blackout is getting more capitals on grid and dying. (Not that I support our caps dying, just caps in general.)
---
Why would you whale as PvE? PvE usually makes isk, PVP usually costs isk.
---
Bitchmode playfighting.
---
Lol, k.
---
I think the role of caps is fine. Fair eve has a quite boring pvp system for structure bashing, and it's just slow. I think we would need caps to be more expensive and have a cost for use a debuff fuel to run modules, warp or to just be u docked so it would be cheaper to not use them. That would make caps rarer and using them would mean some costs. Maybe make them slower and nerf the application but not to much! That would favor subcaps for fast response, roaming and bashing small structures, ratting. While it is not making caps uselles or just siege mashines no one looks up to.
---
Never underestimate CCP's ability to mess things up.  I am not confident this is anything more than a temporary "base line".  Krabs will adapt as will the big alliances.
---
Adapting means going to low or high sec.
---
 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear\_umbrella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_umbrella)  Think of it like this except instead of nuclear defense, the umbrella is a hotdrop ready capital fleet that can be dropped anywhere within the region the umbrella protects at a moments notice through cyno.
---
His glasses went plus blue. üëçüèª
---
You didn't look very hard then.
---
As an Alpha you have limited options. You cannot train more skills at some point because total skill points are limited. Also you cwnnot learn certain skills or levels of skills. I'd call it demo. It is playable, but i got like 20% of content. As alpha you also learn 50% slower.
---
Yeah! No Free Intel Lunch, EVE!
---
Work your LLSO's!
---
Haha, high sec, safe. LOL
---
Please no more structures
---
Oh this one time, at band camp....
---
Wait, I thought the narrative was that all the carebears had already turned into nullbears because, you know, null is safer.
---
I'm confused.  What's changed?
---
I was tired after long day of killing crabs :p  
---
Was currently fit to just shooty shooty with some dda to kill afk crabs, not sit still with cyno and get aggro, i've been refitting from my hauler down here between things.  
---
Traded wrong fit proteus for a Nyx, rattle, some barges vni and stuff was a long day.
---
So what happened as you were afk, this only make it worse though, as i decloaked you finished site so when i tackled you, your drones aggro me, would of been fine as you would of died before me IF ... and this is the best part, I missed the intersect of your orbit and you left web range in like 2 seconds meaning the VNI suddenly shot off, I failed to realize proteus was dying until too late and was like wtf, why is this dying?  
---
But it was funny, me and other sin pilot were in hysterics trying to chase you round grid in the Sins just could not turn the fecking AB off gf   
---
I'll be back for more supidity :)  
---
Should of just killed with proteus but we got greedy. 
---
Unfortunately i don't have the proteus POV but here is from one of the Sins.

Are you looking for stories sharing experiences, or are you also looking for role play stories / lore stories ?
---
Nice skins and all, but I won't pay 2 bil for a BS skin I fly maybe once a month.
---
Pot kettle black at this point
---
We can always dismiss anything as botters. But realistically there are reports of people killing botters all over reddit . 
---
What does the data really represent? It's more likely real people with an ability to reason saying hey, it's not safe anymore. I'm not logging in to lose my rorq/super/carrier

For someone writing on a device connected to the sum of human knowledge, you sure are obtuse.

regret it because you like it too much? =D

1 Keres and the jags up shit creek put a faction scram on a disrupted and some damps and your laughing
---
if he stays at range your laughing and you damp him
---
If he burns in close heated scram will get him and your gang will roll over him in short order every gang could do with a Keres one of the most useful ships in game
---
Just don‚Äôt try to be a hero in it üëç 
---
But if you must be in an inty overheat your scram and don‚Äôt burn to where he is try and always aim at where he will be even if your slower you can actually close the distance with him by taking the shorter route
---
Also I fit my stiletto with dual prop scram and disrupter  
---
With 1 nos in the high and ancil in the lows would post the fit but I‚Äôm at work atm, it‚Äôs worked well for me 
---
And snakes also help
---
So the crabs are multiboxing reddit aswell?

It's amusing that the second bonus skillpoint weekend falls on the weekend that WoW Classic goes live.

http://eve-offline.net/?server=tranquility
---
online come down. true pvp pilots on sabres on gates scream yeeaaas, lol
---
Event - shit, i don't login, and many players too. Eve not only true pvp on cloak sabres on gates in null.
---
ur ratting with 1 other person - put someone on the gate
---
u cant watch a nullsec gate by urself? seems balanced to me, why should u be able to collect isk in the most pve rich area of the game alone in a cruiser and expect to not have a reasonably high amount of risk?
---
hilarious that the "stepping stone" u mention is vni to carrier. 
---
&gt;The meta really hasn't changed no matter how much you pretend it has. 
---
youre right, endgame meta hasnt changed. but player behavior has. maybe it's safer if they go run anoms in lowsec, or try some of the new triglavian content, or even run missions in hisec.
---
u arent entitled to npc ratting in nullsec in complete safety
---
Goon needs more Dew, Mountain Dew.
---
Why is it so hard to just recruit PVPer's who can defend PVEer's? Surely Goonswarm has SOME players who want to PVP. If there's mining OP's or people out ratting in systems then there should be a defense fleet on standby at their in gate. I feel like this is how the rest of eve does it and this is how it should be expected to be done. "I can't mine alone with just my 16 mining alts because I'm afraid people might show up who want to kill me" is just stupid.
---
Neuts. In case you didn't get the memo. Jags run pretty dry on cap under normal circumstances.
---
So I don't need it to put colonies on planets?
---
My Corp is full of carebears that are livid over local and I keep linking stuff like this in the discord every time they calm down. Its halarious.
---
Balanced btw
---
I've upvoted at least 3 posts from you today. I'm concerned now.
---
So you are like diplo or mascot yes?
---
Yup.
---
insane how the mental gymnastics are now at this stage:
---
&gt;you don't have enough data to arbitrarily remove local chat without evaluating the consequences  
---
also  
---
&gt;you guys say blackout is bringing people and content back to the game but all i see is the concurrent players going down  
---
actual mental illness in action
---
Ranjag has shit cap so I'd probably bias to a sentinel
---
Yeah I have, it's mostly botters. Same shit they do on the poli subs.
---
Well yes, they've been all over other subs, from politics to mobas. You really thought they wouldn't come here?
---
We've been getting plenty of kills in delve. If we can manage to get 10+ kills before being dropped on and then still having half our fleet moonwalk out while the rest get boson'd because they weren't aligned then I'll consider that a win. Subcaps are cheap. Small gang roaming is cheap. Nice vendetta loss the other day BTW.
---
Garmur pilots LUL
---
Well, when having 30 ISBoxes for PvE you can also have 30 for reddit ...
---
Yeah, plexes are going down, but market itself is awful. Althought you're a big fish, it's pretty hard to make any isk. Ships are selling below construction cost, people ask stupid amounts of isk for something  with less value. All of this has become worse since blackout. The Curse, which was having a good amount of revenew, now it's selling below building price.
---
I mean, cool sentiment but this is light on details.  What concrete changes could advance this goal?
---
Not diplo, but mascot is fitting yes
---
Exactly this. 1-2 weeks are way to short to really determine an effect. Plus it's summer right now.  
---
Keep it up for 4-12 weeks, if the numbers don't crash too hard, might as well make it permanent.
---
So  much truth  in this.
---
They seem to be ALL OVER this reddit.  They will tell you there are TONS of them subbing dozens of accounts so they can rorq mine and super-rat.
---
I am not going to say it isn't happening since I don't know.  But I am incredulous of such claims.
---
Didn't realize I was the only person to take it as forever. Maybe ccp should be more clear when they are making sweeping changes and not play wordsmith.
---
"Adapt and die" is good, but don't forget "we played the game the way it was meant to be played and won".
---
I guess it was meant to be played with bots instead of PvP.
---
is this - \*\*SALT\*\* ?
---
Good post my friend.  There are so many of us that feel the exact same way.  We've stuck around through a lot of new challenges and and rolled with the punches.  If one single (possibly temporary) change to null intel breaks these people's spirits, then eve simply isn't the game for them.
---
I definitely agree, but the point is, loss of subscriptions = loss of revenue = pressure on CCP to revert.  Now perhaps that loss will be mitigated and possibly overcome by new/returning players, but the data isn‚Äôt showing that currently.
---
Hey! I fly one too sometime :)
---
I'm mostly a Minnie pilot that's sticking with fast/nimble or cloaky.  Been rolling in Polarized Hounds (I'm a whale, shits expensive, don't recommend) or Stratios.

Sabre with a cloak is pretty ugly, too.

I've had decent luck with just taking thrashers out, too.

Is this your idea or is it a copy paste of the ten thousands of ideas from the front page.

Now this looks like a discussion that DnG could really excel in....
---
"It's not the size that matters..."
---
Did she tell you that?  It seems very nice of her, because that isn't what she told me.  ;)
---
I didn't hear about the blackout through reddit. I didn't hear about it through the official forums. I'd given up on Eve completely. I'd given up to the point where I no longer even followed the game at all. But, I'd never taken the effort to unsubscribe from the YouTube channel. 
---
I happened to be browsing YouTube when the scope video dropped. I didn't believe it at first. I'd seen the idea of deleting local discussed ad naseum on reddit back when I did play, and the idea was always shouted down quickly. I watched the scope video. Then I watched it again. Then I went to the official website to read the announcement. Then I went to reddit to confirm the inevitable salt mine. When I had done all that, I finally believed it was real. I re-subbed immediately. I then pinged a few of the PvP loving pilots I knew who had also retired from the game. The beacon had been lit.
---
I spent my first few days back in the game taking care of the basics. I'd upgraded my PC during my hiatus from the game, and neglected to save things like my overview settings. I fixed my overview, liquidated what assets I could, and bought ten stratios hulls to fly until they were dead. I then spent some time picking my target. Goons would be too obvious, and too likely to drop the hammer on everything that moved. Test, PanFam, these would likely yield similar results.
---
My friends and I decided to try hunting in Branch. We toured the outer systems for a while, with not much success. It appeared that the threats being loudly shouted on reddit in regards to unsubbing were true. Frustrated, not willing to give up so quickly, we decided to be ballsier in our approach. We moved over to Tenal, and set up shop in a keepstar staging system for Ranger Regiment. Surely, here in their home system, protected by the might of their keepstar and dozens of other friendly pilots, these brave souls of Ranger Regiment would feel safe ratting. [Our first catch](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77801467/) felt a little bad, the fit making me think he was an actual newbro. [Our second catch](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77801690/) is where the hero of our story emerges. I've killed this same pilot 4 times in the last two days.
---
His first death was a traditional gank in a site. I decloaked, melted his poorly fit VNI, and cloaked up just as the response fleet landed on grid. It felt really good to vanish before their eyes. I hope their comms were full of frustration. After he died, I returned to watching the keepstar. I was surprised to see the same pilot undock another VNI 15 minutes later and warp back to the same site he died in. I thought it was bait for sure, but followed along to make sure. I land in the site, and start watching his ship. The rats are pounding on this poor soul and he's bleeding armour. My buddy and I decloak for the [kill](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77801918/). Again, the response fleet lands, again they are in time to watch us cloak.
---
The pilot made [one more attempt](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77801996/) to recover the loot from his first wreck. He didn't make it.
---
I go to bed, time passes, and I log in for another days worth of shenanigans. My friends aren't around yet, so I amuse myself with a few solo ganks. The loot fairy wasn't amused with [my first one](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77838614/). My second was our [intrepid hero.](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77839037/) He also [still hasn't learned](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77839110/) how to bookmark his wreck and save his loot. Some more time passes, and I'm rewarded again for watching the keepstar. Our hero has undocked again, and this time, he is drifting out of tether range. My friend logs in just in time for [this.](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77840284/) Right on the outskirts of tether range, with fifteen angry Ranger Regiment pilots buzzing about unable to catch us. I laughed for a solid 5 minutes. My wife (who doesn't really like Eve or the fact that I play it) even laughed when I explained what had happened. 
---
At this point something unexpected happens. [Mick Fightmaster](https://zkillboard.com/character/1236402125/) warps his giant balls over to the keepstar and parks them on their undock. Luckily for me, my buddy knew him from back in his time in wormhole space. And we managed to fleet up with [No Vacancies](https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98323701/) for some more content. I've only ever flown against NOVAC in my time in W-space, and I'm glad to see you guys alive and kicking. It was fun flying with you for a little bit. NOVAC combat scanned [this gila](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77840705/) and his abyssal trace, and we camped him out. 
---
Then [this guy](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77840788/) logs in. He undocks his orca and without even a second glance at all the wrecks of his friends, warps to a belt. I admire his gusto.
---
I had to leave at this point, real life calling me away from the keyboard. But I'm still there, cloaked and waiting in enemy territory. I'm very excited to get home and do some more hunting. Who knows, maybe today I will be the hunted. Either way I look forward to it.
---
As an aside, this blackout is the most fun I have had in Eve since before citadels were added. Hunting in null feels like the old hunting I did in W-space where my patience and careful scouting paid off. Back in the days where you would sit off a POS and wait for guys to ship out of their recons and into their marauders. I'm glad to be back enjoying the game I loved so much. I hope to fall in love with it all over again. Long live the blackout.
---
The ratting anom changes had a pretty significant effect on the number of supers a system could support. There was definitely a noticeable spreading out of pilots into the edges of the supercap umbrella.
---
You need to remove your wormholer tag bro. Ships over 300m mass can go through large holes, you just need to activate the prop mod immediately after clicking Enter Wormhole. My rolling Domis are 336m prop modded so I can reliable just do 3 out hot, 3 in hot. Git gud.
---
You'd have to be on my fucking watchlist. I'm gone from here.
---
As a gamer, I've always wanted to play EVE and start to understand it. My time in the game has been spent with a trader in Jita, programming an Excel sheet to help me better choose my trades, and putzing around in WH space.
---
Nullsec was always a place that I never went in fear of being mass swarmed and not learning much in order to combat it. However, with this change, I feel more comfortable to solo roam hoping to find a fight that I can keep learning from dying at. This game is unforgiving, but wonderful. The issue with it being unforgiving means that it can also be expensive. Without finding a good way to make ISK, it becomes really difficult to sustain that learning process. PLEX is not always something I can afford, so I love that it provides so many great ways to gain ISK. Ratting, mining, agent missions or even playing the market. This game just has so much depth!
---
Anyway, I just wanted to write a small story about my time in EVE over the years trying to learn this gloriously complex game. Even though I probably won't get the PLEX, I think that it's extremely cool to see something like this occurring in the community. This sort of kindness encourages more kindness.
---
Careful, that was the death of /u/unidan RIP In Peace

This is what the legacy player base actually thinks tho

nice post.

I don't appreciate the cut-shaming going on here.

and make 2 isks per hour?
---
Truly ... I cannot think of a more accurate description of what happened in EVE the last 3 years ...
---
I credit card sub every single one of my accounts so all the isk i make i can reinvest or blow on pvp ships.
---
but vni cant jump
---
They got blued too ...
---
you will kill your game when jita stockpiles dry out
---
Because database schema specifies "not NULL" attribute on name field?
---
i was exaggerating more like 20
---
So, you're saying that every alliance in Null is exactly the same?  Fuckouttahere with your what-if bullshit.
---
Sure, if you tweak EVERY variable so that it suits your comment, you are 100% correct.
---
But in the real world, AND EVE, that's not how it is and only an idiot or a newbro would think that.
---
I mean I do and so do quite a few of my corp mates. Nice thing about being a successful adult with a good job is you dont have to come home to grind for isk for the privilage to play a game.
---
Yeah, I remember that!  He was such an ass to that poor girl.
---
Well these bastards sucked me back in with their 3 month omega + 3 MCT. Also on a side note..
---
I spent 3 hours of flying around trying to find sites only to have the few I found be cherry picked over. So I got pissed enough to go fit an astero for pvp and went actively looking for explorers in my area. First one I found, I crept up to him and I literally flew into him while stealthed, decloaked, targetted him, and pressed the scram and web. He was in a sunesis and warped out before i could launch drones. Not sure why the scram didn't work. He must have had multiple stabs? 
---
So then I find out that we have NRDS in our area of null and get bitched at for trying to kill explorers. I'm sorry but if neut explorers are f'n with my content I should be allowed to go hunt them. lol
---
Apparently I am supposed to look them up on KOS first. And if I see them cherry picking then I can have them added to the KOS list. smfh
---
Long story short, I tried pvp and failed and then got yelled at. lol
---
Copy and pasting from another comment of mine because there's more than one illiterate dumbfuck in here:
---
"It amazes me how many people that play eve are illiterate or don't do reading comprehension if there isn't a tldr. Pvp pilots are sticking around to kill any non Legacy targets, crabs are retired."
---
Once again, I'm not sure why so many of you think this discussion hinges on deciding whether j-space is more or less dangerous than null.  Most of us frankly do not give a shit.
---
Similarly off-target is your history lesson on the role of rorquals.  It is a mining capital ship that has a 6? minute invulnerability window.  What the fuck? This has never made sense, but the pvpers that remain in the game dealt it, even though it has put the game's economy firmly in the dumpster.  Now, there's finally been a tweak to null that does something _other than_ directly favor crabbing.  It's made the game more fun.  We're not sorry for that.
---
Made up fights with no meaning, any invasion, structure attacks or even direct whaling is forbidden. If someone attacks anyone from these groups it is a coalition
---
lol badik
---
Re-read my comment. 
---
I'm not dismissing anything, I'm stating we have no idea, and making any kind of "picture" from one piece of data is a pretty inane thing to do.
---
Phone= auto correct

You will figure it out eventually dont worry
---
If I ever have cause to fly a Jackdaw, I'm going to name it after him.
---
Posted multiple times yesterday fam
---
Doesn't SC typically just explore in frigates? If he managed to get dropped and podded in the time it took to jump in, throw probes and cloak then he honestly deserved it. This story sounds like bullshit to me but I've also encountered quite a few SC scouts like the guy in a half bill pacifier with a half bill pod.
---
Falcon, as an old Polaris Agent I have one simple request:
---
Make shit dangerous again.
---
But if there is no local, how you know that you have 4:1 numbers so you dare to engage?
---
Yeah I would all but guarantee that there‚Äôs nothing of value in Reddit from an accounting forecasting model preparation process lol.  
---
Maybe if the business heads are allowed to provide input they may be influenced by what they see from certain posters... but that‚Äôs a reach.  
---
Twitch streamers/viewers would even be more substantive than the shit on this site.   
---
Players/accounts/paid subs vs plexed subs/omega to alpha ratio/player response rates to sales (skins, the SP event, the MTC for 3 months, etc).  
---
They have baselines already now they‚Äôre testing the players responsiveness in light of the blackout.  They‚Äôll have lots of data to look at by the end of July.  
---
They also know the obvious stuff like players undocking, ratio of Hs/lazy/0.0/jspace undocking.  Similar space assets destroyed.  Daily value created/lost.  I‚Äôm sure they have an up to the minute ticker of the big MER numbers.  
---
You manage your business based on numbers and metrics not based on how loud the voices in the echo chamber get.
---
We were young in the game..maybe 3 to 4 months. Around ten guys who met in starter corp and formed our own wee corp to chill, help each other with missions and even stage mining ops. Like beginners, we flew a variety of ships..none of them well as we'd always stop missile training to train mining or scanning for an op. 
---
Apart from being gank victims on occasion, we hade no experience of PVP, and no desire to be involved for quite a while. Why should we..we were poor and having fun doing our own thing.
---
But being Eve, the choice isn't always in your own hands. Inevitably I suppose, we got war decced. We looked at the corp who decced us...a single guy who flew a Vengeance. We really hadn't got into T2 yet and didn't know what the capabilities of the ship were. we tried to stay away, but being located in a certain area made us easy prey. Even if we jump cloned away to location B, it didn't take him long to find us. The war dragged on over the first week and it was tough.
---
But then we noticed something strange. There was an older player in our public chat. He was experienced in the game, and gave us some good advice and even helped us replace ships on occasion. We noticed, that our war target would often log on within 5 to 10 minutes of our friend logging out. It became a trend.. so we confined any war chat to corp chat, apart from the intel we wanted him to have. We decided that the next weekend we'd set a trap. We'd all be online and go for it Sunday as a couple of us were offline Saturday.
---
Then disaster. Impatience and an eagerness for revenge for a recent kill prompted the pilots online on Saturday to try take him on. Everyone arrived to the fight at different times, leaving him the simple job of shooting the T1 destroyer, frigate or cruiser that landed next to him. The biggest danger he faced was running out of missiles. Even worse, the corpies reshipped and jumped back in...one at a time. 
---
Next day, he posted in the pirate forum on the Eve boards. he posted the killboard link..14 kills, and even an image of his ship surrounded by wreckage. It was humiliating.
---
The only thing we could do was regroup and make sure we didn't mess up on Sunday. We nearly did..but we only found out after the fact. Our friend was in chat, while we plotted in corp. Around 8pm he logged. Straight away the war target logged in. We were on. we set our bait, a thrasher with webs and scrams in the next system and waited on the gate. "War target in local" said the bait in coms. "he's jumped to gate, he's seen me and he's changing course..point, point, point". At that, we all jumped through the gate and set course for the target. We were a motley crew in a variety of ships..from battleships to frigates, ten intrepid pilots looking for a first kill. I was in a Cyclone BC and I got to the target first..which I thought was odd since my ship was one of the slower ones. The Megathron Battleship was stuck on gate...yeah, next time fit a prop mod...or at least rail guns dumbass. The Drake was flying in the opposite direction...firing missiles as it headed directly away from the target. Are you Italian? WTF? (No it was in full passive PVE recharge configuration). 
---
The remainder of us knuckled down. The Vengeance is a tough little ship with a bonus to it's already T2 resists. Pair that with a faction repairer and shoot at it with low skilled weapons and it can last for a while. Luckily, we did have lots of webs. After an age of seeing armor dip and then magically repair to full, we hit hull. The Megatron was now only 220 km away till it could apply damage, but the tough little bastard was struggling. one final push and it exploded in a blinding flash. Our comms exploded in whoops and cheers. We couldn't have been happier if it was a Titan kill. 
---
Then someone mumbled, Ah cahnt talk..followed by more mumbling about mouth hurting. We had been so focussed and stressed that all our jaws had locked tight. 
---
Our friend left chat and was never seen again
---
So y'all (the helpful ones at least) convinced me (along with their stupid 3 months + mct deal) to resub. Gonna take the advice and move back to an astero now that I have dscan set to actually show probes (it wasn't) and some other tips I think I will be ok. I still don't particularly care for the blackout but I'm not adamantly against it anymore.
---
The reason I don't really engage Hookbills anymore.
---
Also, they should nerf bulkheads. It's the default now (except for special hull bonusses), it's getting boring.

\+1 good thing you decided to give this its own post
---
Goons and init regularly shoot rorquals and freighters in eso.  And vice versa.  
---
You guys are clueless
---
Dude I really do need new friends lol. I've made billions from the blackout and they die every 10 mins it seems.
---
Mmmk
---
Lmfao. Everything about that situation is avoidable for the freighter. There is nothing a hunter can do if you fly your jf correctly.
---
INVEST INTO EVERYTHING
---
I could live with them going on the field, I cannot live with a capital ship not having capital "drone" (e.g. Fighter) mechanics and so can be scaled to huge multiboxes. Not just that 1 Rorqual exponentially raised the ore amount 1 mining char gathers, with them being limitles multiboxable this ore inflation problem got its own turbo .... Ever asked yourself who is responsible for the current PLEX price or the ore price slope? 100% responsibilty goes to multibox Rorq miners.
---
If they didn‚Äôt have botting before...

Guys ccp is adding +10 inplants. I just noticed them on sisi so they must be new

"Hey Babe, get ready for the FORGEMASTER!!"

I can see that going well.
---
Thanks for your comment, it warmed my soul to know that I took away that little bit of your life.
---
I do all that and still get red on my killboard.  FC what do?
---
No, there are things that this insular autist camp we call r/eve think are wrong with the game, and most of the changes I have seen 'implemented' over the last 2 years have all been r/eve talking points. 
---
Case in point, it was mostly r/eve shouting for years about the removal of local in null sec, and ta-da! Also, if were not the case CCP would not feel the necessity to post here in response to this community at all, and would stick to making announcements on the eve-o forums. 
---
For example, I have *never* seen CCP Falcon, nor anyone else from CCP, post about changes on, or make responses to, SA comments and conjecture regarding their game.
---
I think both hisec and lowsec need some love. They have had very few or no updates while null was the focus of most patches.
---
fantastic
---
I feel like the Eve community doesn't realise this is a Copy Pasta from the interwebs.
---
I thought memes were against the rules and deleted by automod?
---
Storytime?
---
Did they hurt your wittle itty bitty FarmVille game sweety.
---
&gt;i think most of the people high on blackout are wormholers or smallgangers who have no real stake in the game beyond using it as an arcade pvp simulator and they're enthusiastic about the blackout because it lets them collect much more mlg montage footage and/or zkillboard points against idiots too dumb to adapt to mechanics
---
So you want eve to be ... what exactly? Nullsec blocks only? Genuinly curious.
---
What level of "arcade pvpers" would be acceptable to you?

The atmosphere was tense inside that little stuffy room in the SCC head office in the Yulai system. The status of the Fluid Router network was all over the monitors, along with a warning of the diminishing supply of Vital Quantum 4-Helium Superfluid. Everybody in that room knew what they had to do to keep the Empire as safe as possible. Nobody wanted to do it.
---
‚ÄúCome on Dominic, push the button. Surely such an important task should be handled by the most senior operator here.‚Äù Stephen blurts out, beads of sweat forming on his brow. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want all this blood on my hands, do you have any idea what this will cause?‚Äù a frazzled Dominic replies, ‚ÄúHow many millions will die when we do this?‚Äù
---
Silence falls over the control room once more. The two men diverting their gaze from each other because they feel too ashamed to be looked into the eye. All the while the monitor between them displaying the email they received.
---
&gt;My valued employees,
---
&gt;
---
&gt;It is with a heavy heart that I am writing you this email to let you know that the CONCORD Inner Circle has decided the FTL communication routers in nullsec need to come down. Bare minimum functionality only. Please make these adjustments to the system on July 12th YC121 at 1100 universe time.
---
&gt;With the utmost regard and respect for what I‚Äôm asking you to do,
---
&gt;Eman Autrech
---
&gt;CEO of the SCC
---
As the time nears 1100, Stephen jumps out of his chair noticeably agitated, his eyes flaring with a visceral rage that stems from frustration. ‚ÄúDo you truly care about the lives of those fucking fake gods out in that lawless space? They can‚Äôt even die anyway, all that happens is they just wake up somewhere else in a new body. Let them all fucking burn I say!‚Äù he yells to Dominic.
---
Not expecting this display of passion, Dominic jerks his head and body backward forcing his chair to roll away from Stephen before he can regain his composure. In a silent, sullen voice he replies ‚ÄúNo, you young ass. I could not give a flying fuck about what happens to those tyrants. God knows what kinds of deals they made to become capsuleers, but I can only assume they were not pretty.‚Äù 
---
Dominic takes a deep breath and pushes his glasses further up his nose before continuing ‚ÄúBut think about it though, they fly giant death machines. Do you really think one person can manage that? Even if they are a demigod? No. There are dozens, thousands, millions of people just like us on those ships. Hoping to make a living to sustain their families on some fringe planet or station. What have they done to deserve this?‚Äù
---
Yet again the silence overtakes the room, but with the gravity of the words that were just spoken, it feels like the entire solar system just fell silent. Stephen‚Äôs body loses all tension and just limply falls back into its chair. ‚ÄúFuck‚Äù he says, then silence yet again. ‚ÄúThey knew what they signed up for when they boarded those ships.‚Äù he said, not so much to refute what Dominic said, but more to convince himself of that fact.
---
‚ÄúIf we don‚Äôt do this now, think about what will happen to the billions living in the Empires though, Triglavians, Drifters, pirates, think about all those bastards attacking the innocents in Empire that can‚Äôt coordinate because the communication lines are down Dominic!‚Äù
---
The two men lock their gaze onto each other and they instantly knew what they had to do, though neither of them wanted to. Almost as if orchestrated both of them reached for the button and pressed it. The routers in the nullsec systems are now running at low-power, only picking up on signals sent out by those ships that want to be known.
---
The rest of their shift was quiet. At 1700 universe time Roxette and Drom came to relieve Dominic and Stephen for the night.
---
On the shuttle back to his dwellings Dominic‚Äôs Neocom Communication Device beeps. The shuttle passes Dominic‚Äôs regular stop at deck 119 but he forgets to get off while he‚Äôs looking at the Neocom. It‚Äôs only when the shuttle reached the end of the line up at observation deck 125 that he finally gets off.
---
Wandering around for a while tears running down his face Dominic found what he was looking for, the big railing at the edge of the station, showing a magnificent view of Yulai III, the planet around which this station orbits. As he takes in the view in quiet contemplation the Neocom rings again, to a voice call.
---
Dominic drops the Neocom, when it meets the ground the screen cracks but the power stays on, you can read the message that he received while in the shuttle:
---
&gt;Dominic,
---
&gt;I heard that Jon boarded a capsuleer ship today, some rookie miner that decided to set up shop in Dital. I don‚Äôt like this one bit. Be a father for once in your life and tell him to not get involved with those people, nothing good ever comes from those people.‚Äù
---
Meanwhile, something else drops to the floor as well. Dominic hits the floor back at deck 121, limp. The last thing he heard was the voice recording from the Neocom:
---
‚ÄúDad‚Ä¶ help me..‚Äù Jon screamed with tears in his eyes ‚Äúmy captain made a mistake, he piloted his ship into KBP7-G. Since his comms didn‚Äôt pick up anyone else he wanted to go mine Bistot since it was worth more,‚Äù meanwhile you can hear an explosion in the background ‚Äúbut as we landed in the asteroid belt, some pirates showed up from nowhere, demanding we give them ISK, but the captain ref‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ &lt;beep&gt; &lt;beep&gt; &lt;beep&gt; *The person you are calling can not be reached right now, we at the SCC apologize and hope to reconnect you soon*‚Äù

Damn now this is a first for Reddit  I totally agree with you and I forgot about the MTC 3 and of course the other log in for SP and kill NPCs for SP events running through the summer. All useful measures to see how well player retention and engagement is going, it also helps to lock some subscribers in to allow a reasonable time to look at the figures and smooth out any minor bumps caused by players having a huffy fit but likely to return once the dust settles.  Pity I will never get to review the figures CCP has the projections will make for some interesting reading and of course might suggest more "events" in the future. Interesting times.
---
are you high dude? Or do you just lack reading comprehension? If you're referring to the ones I said were ratting, please note that I said *many* of them were. Not *all*. I know you guys don't usually kill the supercaps helicopter dicking on you but for fucks sake chill out and learn to read
---
lol that's a good one.

I had no idea we had so many values in eve in common.  The concept of asset safety has always baffled me.
---
I keep saying, if you are going to do it, do not do it half assed. Remove it from low-sec as well; or, at least put local in low-sec on a delay, and the amount of time appearance in local is delayed in low-sec linked to the security status of the system. 
---
Honestly, just from the point of view of making a .4 systems different from .1 systems its worth it.
---
I mean it is a 5b+ ship with a 5 minute siege, do you really think it shouldn't have an invlun?
---
Woah slow down there, either he's dual web or dual prop or dual anc shield booster. And if he's dual and shield boost the rest of his fit is in shambles, those eat CPU and pg like crazy, and odds are he only has drones for damage and not a single resist mod. Wreck his face with kin/exp, it's not hard. And keep in mind, your gang should be mobile, if the enemy fleet is catching up just piss off.
---
I once engaged 15 Chinese in kitey cruisers with a single jag, I was flying dual nano rlml orthrus with just scram+point. Got their jag to hull before he had to break off with no tackle besides my scram in under 20s. A 4-5 man gang would have splatted him easy while his friends were still 70+ km behind, approaching at 2-3k/s.
---
HiSecrs wanna take a look how a true carebear looks like.
---
Ok, just checked zkil, there is exactly 1 (ONE) killed Super in Coalition space in whole 2019, some T1 kitchen sink drunken fleet killing a Nyx in Esoteria. All other kills are either from Goons north SIG in Horde space or dropping on their GotG pets, or it is when they kill identified Bots in their own space or renting space (good job btw.). Does not look like active hunting in directly neighbouring regions to me
---
Different issues at play here.
---
Rorquals are responsible for supercapital proliferation, while Alpha VNI/bot carriers/supers are responsible for PLEX prices. Rorquals increase the supply of ore, ratting bots increase the supply of isk. The supply of ore from rorqs is keeping the price of ore low and ship prices low/stable. There's no complementary increase in plex bought from CCP so their supply is only marginally higher so there's a lot more botting isk competing for only a bit more PLEX.
---
Make more of these, they're very enjoyable.
---
you're so full of shit lol
---
I agree, that guy is totally full of shit
---
Real talk. I'm tired of seeing the most punchable face in new eden.
---
Hmmm, I wonder how someone with a Rorqual-Multibox subs this accounts ... I am quite sure it is not with real money but with ingame hours ...
---
&gt; So, you're saying that every alliance in Null is exactly the same?
---
so which alliance can magically turn local back on?
---
&gt; ur ratting with 1 other person - put someone on the gate
---
so now the income is halved?
---
the activity is no longer worth bothering with.
---
Keep in mind that "PLEX'ing" doesn't actually put money in CCP's pocket and they don't care if a guy that runs 30 PLEX'd Rorqs quits.  It just means that PLEX prices on the in game market will go down for once.
---
If you mean actual legit subs, then I haven't seen many of those lost, and I am the CEO of a large corp.  If anything, I have seen more paying customers come back to Eve than quit.  My corp is more active during blackout than prior to it.  Some of my PvP oriented friends that quit Eve for other games came back.
---
&gt; but the data isn‚Äôt showing that currently.
---
Source?  I do not believe you have that data.  At best you can speculate based on logged in characters, but guess what?  Bots hate blackout.  Mass multi-boxing perma bear PLEX'ers hate blackout.  Both of those groups are not logging in as much and I do not think Eve is worse off if both of those groups quit or change their ways.
---
He burned at 90 degrees instead of away so I was still at 4k off when I should have been orbiting at 500 so I decided to warp off rather than trying to adjust. I could have paid better attention but the angle I was looking at the fight from was also pretty deceiving. I linked the fight above.

Null bears aren't actually a real thing, and as a member of a huge coalition with a giant super capital umbrella, I am totally happy with the change. It literally makes zero difference to those of us rich enough to rat in supers or mine in Rorquals when we can call on our super standing fleet that will boson you in the face until you're dead. 
---
Really, we should be thanking for pushing smaller null sec groups into our fold. 
---
And also, since you think this is the way null sec should be because it works so well for wormholers... we can drop cynos and covert cynos in your wormholes when?
---
Cheers! If I get time, I'll have a look and see what data is available.

dont you ?  what kinda of capsuleer are you with only one account .. pfftt!

My fat finger grew tired even scrolling page downwards reading the stories

Ahh shit!

No i thought he thought the original comment was against blackout. lmfao this is some hilarious shit.
---
Best post ever. 
---
Long term thinking on Eve is rare and should be a common exercise on CCPs part routinely. Sandboxing an environment (RL or not) means you can revisit and reevaluate very quickly and affect the entire ecosystem with minimal effort.
---
Sunken cost and the entertainment that Eve may provide will keep people playing the game even if CCP breaks something but course-corrects fast enough.
---
The same way that afktars/afkvnis/adfmyrms/adfkdomis do. The raw isk/hour of Rorquals is not all that much higher than Afktar. The difference is that Rorqs are much safer but have a higher upfront cost.
---
The truth.
---
Delete jump gates or at least fully restore fatigue to them would help a lot IMO.
---
But, wouldn't you rather sell some isk illegally for money and use said money to pay some shady people to let the bots lose on your behalf? It's also kind of like going full circle.
---
:D player solutions to dev problems

Side effect of how damage controls work.

You ran those blitz fleets in CO2 back in impass?  those were the bomb!

That is the most effective way to play there. I didn't design it, not my fault it's broken as hell.

Honestly a keepstar can dock a super, it should be really costly...
---
The memes must flow.
---
I've been there. Come back to kill mails before. Someone got a bil tengu kill with an afk vni before. Think it was a farmstink alt. He was picking up the mtu and saw there was not sansha faction loot in it so checked his kill mails and bam there it was
---
then go to high sec
---
Make attempts to take each other's space, nothing else really matters anymore. Economy in Eve is borderline post-scarcity for anything smaller than a supercarrier.
---
I see it differently. A bot makes so much money that he doesn't care if a Nyx bursts or not. You have to approach the problem differently.  The blackout won't work. It's more about all other players getting their game broken. They are not all PVP¬¥ler. You should think something about your horizon.
---
What about all the PVE¬¥ler? All the miner standing somewhere in the belt and mutliboxing three Hulks or Rorquals ? Without Bots. The game is destroyed for all these people. Not everyone who has 5 to 10 accounts or more is a botter. 
---
And even if they plex their accounts and don't pay. Every ingame Plex was bought with money. The bottom line is that it always comes out the same.
---
As an explorer, I am excited to hear this. I wasn't sure how this Local change would impact me, so I appreciate this explanation.
---
Now, hopefully I can make it home safely with that loot.
---
THIS! 
---
This is why the blackout is great.

All you null-bears should be out there hunting instead of complaining.

Thanks, been singing this song since Lifeblood ... maybe your ingame role backs this more as my "salty pvper" opinion
---
If you're a real market manipulator and we're following your advice we will now be:
---
Selling our Plex to \*\*\*you\*\*\* and buy Modules from \*\*\*you\*\*, only to find out that the markets behaved in the exact opposite direction and later on we will be buying our own Plex back from \*\*\*you\*\*\* and \*\*\*you\*\*\*'ll be happy to take those worthless modules of our hands.
---
Or are there some double mindgames going on?
---
Do the Dew.
---
I've pretty much given up on any of that happening so I use ship's names to "classify" them.  Some just by name (ie. fast cheap Nereus haulers are all "Hustler ..." where "..." can be "Hannah", "Henry" etc.  On some toons I have them prefixed, ie "AMS" for alpha mission ship, "ACS" alpha combat ship, etc.
---
Of course this begs the CCPlz pf getting ship names extended to more than 20 measly fucking characters to be helpful.
---
Botters can't bot in null now, so they'll be turning to not only market botting, but also level 4 high sec mission botting
---
Git gud should be the answer to counter play, that's how a skill-based game works.
---
Source? I kinda wanna see this shit in action.
---
People use sub 300m ships not because of mass limitations but because of math.
---
I reccomend not trading first. It is boring, you will make barely any money with the small starting amount you have, and it will make you quit the game. Train some ships and join a wormhole or null/low corp, its much more fun then sitting in a station and playing with numbers.
---
Noob here and I finally have to ask. Wtf is krabbing? I was hoping to figure it out using context but I‚Äôm still not sure
---
Lower Price of Plex + Higher Manufactured Module Cost + Higher Manufactured Ship Costs.
---
People who's SRP is plex are in for a rough ride.
---
I'm sure there will be a lot of "holes" in the following and maybe some would unbalance more things than they fix (we're just spitballing after all, not drafting a design document), but here's just a quick and dirty list off the top of my head, after 2 minutes of thought:  
---
1. Cap DPS application reverted to the old standards, HAW weapons either renamed and changed in purpose, severely adjusted (on the nerf side of things) or outright removed from the game. In the last case, players who trained them should get their SP refunded to spend on something else (just like CCP did when they scrapped the learning skills, all my old toons got about 1.5 mil SP injected from having trained those skills that were now not in the game). Caps shouldn't be able to operate meaningfully without subcap escorts, unless the enemy also doesn't have subcaps in the field and it's just a straight up cap vs cap brawl. The whole idea is to spice up fleet compositions and incentivize spreading out across systems instead of blobbing a single gate and crashing the servers, and reintroduce the law of diminishing returns into the game, which is a staple of EvE since forever (eg, we get 5% bonus damage per lvl of turret skill, but t2 guns only get 2% per level of the specialization skill, there's a reason they made it like this from the beginning when they first introduced tech2 weapons).
---
2. Different damage thresholds and damage caps for capitals and subcapitals, to reinforce the role of caps as siege assets against structures.  Maybe even different damage caps and thresholds between different structures. So for example, taking down a raitaru can be done with a fleet of rattlesnakes or some HACs and patience, but for the big stuff you'd need dreads and carriers. This would probably make certain already anchored hisec structures too safe from attack (since you can't cyno in the big ships to kill them in hisec), so maybe they could be changed into smaller variants, the cost difference refunded and they would be unable to be anchored in hisec from that point on (it's also inline with the "low and null should get more bonuses and better toys" mentality of the game, more risk, more reward).
---
3. Targettable station services that you can take down with 10-20 guys in a HAC/AF/inty/cruiser/BC kitchen sink fleet, depending on composition. Want to prod someone into forming up for a quick fight? Go there and disable their market or cloning service. Want to wage a long-term campaign of infiltration, interdiction and guerilla warfare? Disable their services multiple times per day over entire regions. They either form up and fight you off, or are slowly reduced into inability to operate basic quality of life services for their members. This means you can spread the fights out over more running engagements, instead of the usual set piece tidi battles we currently have (and which often end in a mexican standoff because the risk of committing/escalating is too high). You can run around in smaller ships, which also don't need the enemy bringing the bigger ships to defend against, especially if cap application against subcaps is nerfed. All in all, instead of having two blobs on a single grid staring each other down for 4 hours before going home to sleep, both sides split their forces into 10-100 man running gangs roaming around and hunting each other, as one side tries to shut down services and the other tries to prevent them, all in much more engageable ships. If the attackers manage to disorganize the defenders over a few days or weeks, then you bring in the big fleet with the capitals for the finishing move. It's much more organic and reminiscent to modern, fluid  warfare: what matters is supply lines, encirclements, area control and denial. You don't have to level every single city you come across to the ground, in fact most armies prefer to bypass pockets of resistance, encircle them and either deal with them later with follow up forces (in our case, the structure bashing capital fleet) or isolate and starve them into submission.
---
4. In order not to make the above a disproportionate pain to rebound from though, the repair time for a disabled station service module should be comparatively small. It could either be a case of "get 20 logis to armor/shield rep our clone bays", or depositing resources into a hangar and let the repairs be done automatically based on certain timers. Or it could be a combination of both. You could choose to grind it out with a logi fleet, dump a bunch of minerals into a cargo bay for the structure and let the "nanoassemblers" or any other lore-justified mechanic to the work for you, or combine both. I like both methods to be honest, because one needs player interaction (although the task is boring, it puts targets on the field), but the second allows you to speed up the boring part (but you still have a fleet on grid and engageable for some time) by burning resources (so we also get a mineral sink). At the very least, it could regenerate on its own at a very slow rate. All in all, the plan is to incentivize more roaming action by giving it an actual impact on space management and the strategic side of things, but without going to the other extreme where space is not worth keeping and maintaining because it's too much of a hassle (eg, it would be stupid if 3 guys in travelceptors could just shut down an entire region's station/citadel services in an hour, but having multiple gangs spread out and create mayhem should be possible).
---
5. A capital (a center of governance, not ship) for nullsec entities. Upkeep cost on structures, fuel amounts, timer windows and durations, repair timers on station services, and a whole host of other parameters that influence structure keeping and bashing, sov mechanics and so on, could scale depending on distance from the capital (measured in jumps, light years, or a combination of both). The capital could be a system or , why not, even a constellation, but definitely not an entire region.
---
Confirming DnG are good people.

I was exited to dive in to nullsec when blackout happened and couldn't wait to join in with fleets and roam systems destroying as much as we could before the bigger fish picked us off. One day I logged on there were no fleets for me to join, (Think it was around US night time so not many people online) so I decided to hop in my new VNI ratting ship and go to nullsec to farm some isk to pay for the PVP I would be doing later. This wasn't the best idea as since there was no local these types of ships would be ganked to hell and I couldn't tell what else was in the system but I had enough money to pay for it and wasn't too bothered if I lost it. I started in Jita and thought the safest way to enter nullsec would be through Thera. However the system I landed in didn't have good combat sites so I left to another system, and sure enough as soon as I landed there was a stiletto doing 4000ms\^-1 around the gate. I knew there was no chance my drones would keep up with him but maybe the could get a few hits off when he came around his orbit of me. So I decided to go for the fight. I decloaked, set my drones off, and locked him up. He got point on me quickly. My drones (caldari navy wasps), would occasionally tag him for around 20 but his passive shield regen was faster than the drones could handle. About 30 seconds later after he messaged his buddies saying he had tackled someone stupid enough to roam nullsec solo in a pve VNI and some more tackle warp in. Once again they were travelling to fast to do any real damage too. I assumed now I would be blown to bits when a small gang or something from his corp warped in but I waited and waited and nothing happened. Eventually I popped up in local asking if they were going to kill me or not, and they replied sorry just waiting for my friends. I guess they were having the same problem I was before I left to do some PVE. After another minute of waiting two ships warped in and one dropped a cyno, I manged to lock and kill it but not before it dropped one. After that kill I locked up the second ship and brought it down to to around 50% armour before it warped off. This was by far the most unorganised PVP I had ever done. I messaged the person that first tackled me telling him that and they replied "yea, sorry we're usually better than this" which made me laugh. Now the engagement time was coming up to 20 minutes and still nothing else had warped in or come to the cyno. I asked what they were going to do now since nothing was happening and they said they weren't sure, but i'll stop pointing and jump to this gate (insert other gate in the system). Sceptical of their intentions I quickly warped off to another planet and upon realising what I had done, they followed hot on my tail. I managed to lose them on the second warp to another planet before they pointed me again. I sat there for a while talking to them in local. They told me they would replace my drones (they had picked a few off) if I follow them a few system away to the nearest station that sold them. I was reluctant as this kind of thing is 99% of the time a trap but for some reason I agreed. Probably because I had been chatting to this guy for about 30 mins now and was enjoying that engagement so much I wasn't bothered about loosing the ship, it also meant I didn't have to fly it back if I was killed. So I warped to the gate and jumped through expecting a scram on the other side but there was none, which surprised me. Like the first gate the next 5 were uneventful and we arrived at the station where he bought me new drones and gifted me 200mill isk. I thanked him for his donation and for the  "fight" and logged off with a wallet that could support more blackout fun over the next few days.
---
Blackout has contained some of the most enjoyable content for me so far, not knowing and the suspense of what you might have to fight is great. Even if I was just flying around whilst pointed waiting for my doom it was hilarious to witness such an unorganised fight. 
---
I used to do WH exploration for ages but this blackout for me has shaken the snow globe (becoming clich√© now, I hesitated writing that but did because I couldn't think of a better way to describe it) and encouraged me to fit up some pvp ships and venture out into nullsec looking for a fight.

CCP makes more money off people who plex than off people who are subbed.
---
Basically people who focus on PVE content
---
Do  you know how to program OAUTH and Web stuff? 
---
This looks doable with the ESI API but it's a bit beyond me
---
https://github.com/tableau/webdataconnector/tree/master/Examples/OAuthProxyExample
---
This would allow ESI to be tied into a web-dashboard.
---
EVE - its PAIN!
---
Yes. im still running some when i have time :) Glad you enjoyed them.
---
A rage comic, god what year is it.
---
I thought we escaped those dark times.
---
I'm just a bit bummed that the MCT deal is coming at a time when I haven't got the money IRL to subscribe for three months.
---
This is my fear :( It would be so insanely useful but yeah.
---
or maybe you should look into a dictionary now and then
---
That is a decent plan, need to come up with a code then just write it on a post it by my monitor (since i will inevitably forget what i made up)
---
&gt;the blackout won't work
---
So far it has, the bots in regions I typically monitor have all gone into hiding since the blackout. And while the legit folks in my alliance that like pve are a bit more cautious, they're still out and about.i know people still multiboxing rorqs and super rating, while the numbers have been cut down, that's not a bad thing
---
The fact is, nullsec shouldn't be safe, if you want safe pve, go back to highsec, if you want the valuable stuff, you shouldn't be able to hide at the back of a pipe where you dock up the second anyone not blue shows their face 5 jumps away due to free intel... more money should mean more danger, and the fact is, that wasn't the case pre-blackout
---
I never said this isn‚Äôt great for the game. It most definitely will be. I just don‚Äôt have any faith in this keeping bitters down for too long.
---
I dunno I particularly enjoyed my procurers having fighters and killing pirates while my capitals were in a deep space. That was a pretty huge nerf compared to the other buffs out there. And let's not forget what titan DD's used to do.
---
&gt;For example, stuff that keeps a check on force projection and instant teleportation of supplies
---
I've always been of the opinion that Cynosural fields should never have been able to be lit *on grid* with a station, let alone inside the fucking docking/tether range therefore making jump freighters invincible when used by anyone with a brain. What was the point of making Cynos visible from anywhere in the system again?
---
I think he is saying I lost a ship (wow) and because they lost lots of ships to me (obviously) I deserve interent fame. Shucks, Thx
---
Do it so! I would really like some sort of new roles instead of the standard DPS/Support/Logi/Tackle mechanic... and a way to make caps usefull but not OP as they are today.
---
I mean i love caps but if there is a way to use them outside of "DD/fighter/HAW overkill" it would be more fun. And change those stupid tether mechanic... make it time limited with a cooldown or something like a seperate debuff for tethering if you leave tether range... i dont know.
---
Yes, yes, and yes in a fleet
---
&gt; brane
---
/u/uwutranslator
---
To speak to a point you made in your OP as well:
---
I've always been of the opinion that Cynosural fields should never have been able to be lit *on grid* with a station, let alone inside the fucking docking/tether range therefore making jump freighters invincible when used by anyone with a brain. What was the point of making Cynos visible from anywhere in the system again? Ships can jump straight from a spot where they are invincible... to a spot where they are still invincible!
---
I guess so. Please down vote accordingly
---
this is the greatest shitpost i have ever seen
---
Horde is the only part of panfam with the balls to fight, so they tend to get mentioned solo now.
---
You'll need it to get materials off the planet if they didn't change that.
---
Coordinates fights in shared FC discord:
---
T1 ferox fleet up under _____(no name FC) bads to fight!!!111
---
Imagine if drifters deleted all the keepstars in the game..... That would be so healthy. I really wish they never allowed supers to dock, and kept it that way.
---
Removing the upwards scaling by 200 actually makes the peaks and dips harder to see
---
Ignore the morons saying you can't do it, this is a sandbox and you can play however the fuck you want.
---
As for trading, most people refer to buying and selling massive ammounts of items in station, which can be really lucrative but needs a lot of isk to be done properly and make a decent profit. This will of course be really hard as a newbro, but in time you can get there.
---
Other form of trading is hauling, which is transporting stuff from one place to another at request of other players. You can do this even as an Alpha and there are several guides that teach how to do it, the different ships and fits to do so more efficiently or safer and so on.
---
Just google it, and pay special attention to how prevent getting ganked while doing it. Even if the guides are some years old don't worry, little has changed in that playstile over the years.
---
Good luck o7
---
/u/ccp trying to off set the lower numbers from the blackout.
---
This should be it's own post. It's beautiful
---
Can't even laugh at this since it's so true in fact I'm even more pissed
---
Roughly how much ISK/h can I make if I run Orca+Exhumer together mining in high sec?
---
This meme got stale, find a new one
---
Clicks scan....doesn't use hotkey...
---
How has this dude played EVE so long yet be so bad at it?
---
&gt; WH are completely different to nullsec they are not the same in the slightest.  They dont have an Intel whatsoever, no gates, no cynos, no cloaky campers, no dotlan and in game intel. 
---
Dotlan has some information on WH, e.g. http://www.ellatha.com/eve/WormholeSystemview.asp?key=100616
---
Also, some of the WH do have cloaky campers sometimes.
---
But I don't disagree with you, just splitting hairs.
---
Upwell structures, tether, panic, excavators, SP injectors, dockable titans, light and support fighters, anom respawns, etc.
---
The absolute tears from krabs when they have to put anything remotely resembling effort into their gameplay?
---
I am shocked that members of reddit only see fit to correct those opposed to the change. I don't see anyone bothering to correct everyone who celebrated the change as permanent.
---
Bonus you people keep dodging that ccp used a vague word on purpose. It wasn't until falcon replied that anyone knew they didn't mean forever.
---
When prices get low enough on a certain module. There will always be someone that wants to reset the market. Put your shit for sale below what someone would reset at. He'll buy you out at some point.
---
this is the best thing to come out of the blackout...wait, no it's my killboard :D
---
It will never happen. You'll never convince every entity to not take advantage of an opportunity to cash in on this planned embargo. I have my doubts it will even happen in the first place. Null is a big place to try to control all material flow.
---
10/10
---
I think we should just what victories we can get and try to keep the scale in balance.
---
Blackout already made a lot of krabs dock up. Making the resources they hunt more scarce will do more of the same. All that does is move the risk even farther away from the reward.
---
Wait so you're telling me of I just keep reloging my character I can inflate stats? I could probably end up being 5% of all daily logins if I put my mind to it. 
---
Logins aren't a meaningful data point for MMOs especially ones with free to play models. Time spent in game and concurrent player numbers are where it's at and a blip of 20 chars in the launch screen before closing means nothing to ccp except that their event didn't get you to play.
---
Your post reminded me of a song by Cpt. Blastahoe:
---
&gt;Listen, fucker, I've seen some things, I've got mean ships, I've got nice memes, but I'm only human, I make mistakes, push wrong buttons, don't make escapes that I should've had, miss tackle that I should've grabbed
---
https://soundcloud.com/cpt-blastahoe/superfinal
---
I mean depends on your definition of good really
---
Then I imagine your concern should be scripted HICs rather than a single point where you can just dock.
---
Old or new api. Don't update on the second. Even the minute.
---
Imagine being this wrong lol, weekend warriors were never in frat, and never got kicked either. 
---
Dumb man being dumb
---
they already multibox everything else
---
aye fairly obvious it was the whole point of the post, fair play to him if it works i guess.
---
Do you want the story here or in a mail in game?
---
Returning PvP players will sell Plex for isk further driving down the price. He does mention this
---
 I did for myself [http://evernus.anver.ee/](http://evernus.anver.ee/)  (to install, you must remove the old version)  
---
Fixed : Character journal  
---
SDE (eve.db) will now be automatically updates.
---
Lawl its not that much of a difference
---
Every PLEX out there was initially purchased with real money.  There is no way to acquire PLEX without CCP getting their $15-20 cut from someone.
---
Wormholes are supposed to be the riskiest space in the game. Currently they are safer than null sec. You can only fit so many people into a hole at one time if you are taking it over. Supers and titans cant be used for evictions.
---
oh for sure, but yaknow memes
---
You can‚Äôt do PI as alpha.
---
"The raw isk/hour of Rorquals is not all that much higher than Afktar." Ahahaha
---
everyone knows what that word means. this isn't about the change, this is about you not having a basic understanding of the english language and trying to blame that on others.
---
Cheers, I'll take a look!
---
i rather have a fight then a kill
---
yeah they have to cover up all those bots not logging in....
---
Don't ever win eve
---
&gt;Cool your jets
---
Hmm, what could Lebowski be hinting at? It could be a module that decreases heat damage, maybe even remotely. And what are jets? A new type of prop mod? Finally something to counter MJD fleets?
---
Three starting points:
---
1. Read the station trading wiki page. Everything you need to know to get started is there.
---
2. Be patient. If you're not comfortable sitting on a lot of worthless bullshit because someone is an idiot and tanks the market instead of .01 isking like EVERYONE SHOULD, you're going to lose a lot of isk. 
---
3. Ignore everyone here telling you how to play. They have a hard time comprehending that different people like to do different things
---
eh, 4, keep track of where your margins are. When trading a few hundred different items over a few months, it gets hard to remember what the price was when you started.
---
Bottom line: as a new player, start with things that sell in low volume at high margins. Deadspace modules are great. Flip one or two a day and it can easily be a hundred mil. Once you get some capital, explore other things. Also train all the relevant skills. A couple percent here and there makes a huge difference.
---
Spicy meatball.
---
Lvl 5 for med drones, lvl 4 for interfacing.
---
The memes must flow
---
The reward was so fucking away from the risk that getting them a little closer is a must at this point. 
---
The blackout is doing so, but to be honest I think we need *at least* a month or so of statistics to say if it is enough, it went to far or we need to do more.
---
That being said, I think resource's scarcity is something that points to a different problem: concentration of massive groups in small regions and the lack of any real motivation to go to war. War over resources is the most basic and ancient form of conflict between human groupd.
---
I am Cacique Yuhasz ingame
---
The fun part about the blackout is  that also is happening in cuba we are having blackouts too  since the began of summer   and  is incredible hot here
---
so after the yesterday blackout i plug my cell phone  , open launcher and jump into eve , spent a hour thinking what to do , cause krabbing is something i must to do be able to buy ships and keep things running as a cuban living  in cuba  maybe other people know what it is about
---
so  pick up  a my ship  and praying to bob  hope not been destroy  , went to the anomalys to do my thing  waiting for some ticks to  in my wallet ,  sometimes forgot  dscan  no really use to that 
---
was an entire discovery  and who know if i get use to it  , at the end of the day  before time run out  i enjoy a conga time with others mates that was fun 
---
and so  wake up early today and blackout was a thing from 7:00 am to 1 :00 PM lol  i guest is not just eve
---
fly safe
---
no spud in hisec
---
Risky click of the day
---
I just came out of the trading hole. Just don't do it. You need a big sum of isk, trading is about altering the markets, and you can't do that with 1 billion isk. It may seem easy at first, you find a place where price is low, then another where price is high, then you buy a bunch of those things, transport them somehow to the other market, put a selling order and watch how nobody buys it, other people constantly stomp your prices and you get to the conclusion you ended up getting little no money for hours of your time. Also placing buy orders for low prices and instantly put them in selling orders is a chore, where you get almost no isk for. Now, if you just like that game, and you want to do it regardless if it's profitabe or not, go ahead. I've been doing industry for years with almost no profit.
---
Probably Pandemic Horde for most total content. 
---
Can‚Äôt say for sure since between the move to Kalevala/Etherium Reach and the blackout things are going to be different (I left Horde a few weeks ago to try out j space), but before I left you could just check dotlan for activity and you‚Äôd see one of our systems at the top of all pvp metrics. For a while we had the top two, but the move to bwf consolidated a lot of activity into that one system. 
---
Still, I would be very surprised if Horde wasn‚Äôt the most active still, and to check it just compare the dotlan numbers for Kalevala and Etherium Reach (our new home regions) against places like Catch/Impasse (Brave and other Test pets live there)
---
its not about embargo, its about 90% of everything in jita comes from null crabs, who arent undocking anymore
---
Hoes mad x40
---
jets are on idle, can you reuse the POS system scanner structure that already exists to make something that scans every 10 seconds (7.5 ro 5 for t2/ faction) and updates local accordingly? that would be a neat thing, something that has to reinforment timer aswell so a larger invading force can wipe it off the field quickly and that potential 10 second delay might be nice to spice local up a bit w/o completly having it gone (unless you dont have sov/ that structure anchored)
---
What prevented them from doing this before blackout?
---
I'm the same age as the guy you rmt for in your rorq.
---
Even if the last part of what you say is true, the non-empire nullsec player has been neglected for years and told to adapt. AKA, join an empire or quit. It's time for another play style to get nerfed into the ground.
---
&gt;Targettable station services that you can take down
---
I think this is a great idea. 
---
I think one big thing CCP got wrong with citadels was not porting over things that worked in the POS/Outpost system to create content or weaken the defender advantage. You should absolutely be able to shut down station services or citadel weapons (equivalent to defanging a POS).
---
buy high sell low
---
Kinda. Only the ones that are okay with being in giant corporations in order to fly a certain ship. But people like this dude just wanna play with their family, or a select small group I think It‚Äôs more accessible for solo players now. Because 1-4 ships can slip by and maybe do sites in a more backwater location.
---
This is because they don‚Äôt pop up on your radar on jump 1 making it more of an even playing field for micro and solo players to get past the gate guards and into those relatively underused areas. I approve of this because you could always slip by the gate camps via wormholes anyways and this would make people want to take the journey. It gives them a really good card to play and that is the power of surprise until they use it. 
---
In other news. It‚Äôs probably the best time to sneak into stain with a blockade runner if you‚Äôre a solo player. Or if you‚Äôre in traditional 0.0 alliances maybe the daily gate camp turns into a small patrol and check the gates,  check in with krabs for any abnormal behavior and maybe count anomalies if you have autism.
---
I think CCP wants to make changes to the way bit alliances work. By haveing to consolidate closer to home and establish fortresses at choke points where you can patrol and drop a few capitals from (where you set up jump bridges, Jump clones Ext ect)
---
It‚Äôs now about strategically placing your structures to meet the requirements of the alliances instead of everyone circle jerking. 
---
Tl;dr It‚Äôs just fog of war making people feel like they have better odds and gamble going past the traditional 6-12 choke points into 0.0.
---
The title of the post on reddit was "Blackout now forever" so I am going to say that no not everyone knew and most people believed it was now a permanent change.
---
Also even if the change is permanent it would still fall under indefinite because ccp could change their mind in 10 years. So of we follow your logic of taking the word exactly as it means we can safely take it to me ccp has decided this is now the long term plan moving forward.
---
null had like 3 people back in the day
---
Wait, are there actual goons unsubbing? Like, not even propaganda, I haven't seen or heard this kind of behavior. Outside of Delve Pest Control, Delve has been ultra quiet.
---
If you want to start out in trading as an alpha -&gt; 
---
 - go to Nullsec and join one of the larger alliances.
---
 - salvage and loot PVP wrecks from strat-ops and standing fleets till you have a good amount of seed money (shouldn't take too long)~ 100-200M
---
 - place buy orders on market for expensive commonly dropped PVP items 
---
 - you can resell them at market rate
---
 - learn to use your alliance's hauler services to move items to Jita that don't sell in your alliance's market hub. 
---
 - learn to use corporate contracts to sell high-value items like abyssal mods.
---
The amount of reward isn't the point and don't care about tears. It just seems the whole gameplay loop was better and i wonder why it has changed in the first place.
---
A one month sub with cash costs $10-14. 500 plex costs $19.99. PLEXing makes much more money for CCP than subscribed accounts. Higher demand raises in game cost of PLEX, which encourages people to buy since they get more bang for their buck. CCP absolutely wants those 30 rorq accounts to PLEX.
---
But why?
---
I don't know, Tri seems to take fights but are 1/64 the size of horde haha. Pl NC slyce and those MEAN boys on the other hand.......
---
Called it, lol
---
You need to swuat like ruski first
---
Eveworkbench.com they have alpha friendly fits and omega only separated.
---
Then stop ganking traditional targets like transports/haulers/miners and go after other targets. You do know all those other ships in jita can also be shot, right?
---
What are you planning on investing in and what starting capital do you have?
---
Trading is end game m8 you gotta know a  bit of the game first.
---
Welcome to eve
---
You are looking for someone's, tho'. Would try to show off otherwise, would you?
---
Oh I've always kinda seen it the opposite. I never cared to buy Plex way back when because it would buy me 1/3 of a bhaalgorn. Wasn't worth the money. Now I can get like... 6-9 bhaals no issue and basic fittings. Although that is both drop in cost in bhaals which may bias by point. Although I do also understand your perspective since CCP may sell less Plex to more people instead of more Plex to less people. I would enjoy the stats on that if CCP was willing to publish them. Sales/value over time
---
Already a bigger baller than gevlon goblin
---
10k characters spent bashing stale mechanics but no mention of cynos?
---
Eesti leht? Allright, what did u fix?
---
Hotpockets are blue to goons lol
---
Abyssal mods are basically just officer mods.
---
Im saying if i log in, thats a tick. They dont care if i log in and provide content or if i just log in. You are delusional if you think they separate log in stats between active players and log in blips when they market or present the numbers.
---
I love the local changes... but the best part is the "iM uNsUbBiNg My 17 AcCoUnTs CcP"
---
Ive been farming roamers v0v
---
Yeah I just did that, even though I subbed only 2 days earlier. CCP said "NOPE"
---
i literally dont have the skills for a rorq? and boomer is a way of life not necessarily an age lol
---
On average, how much systems is included inside an umbrella?
---
I enjoy this comic.
---
Where did you grab the nebula background you used for the final panel?
---
If it looks too good to be true, it is.
---
U can also praxis :)
---
Adapt. Just remove them from overview.
---
God this is a good one
---
At this point with the blackout using excavators is such high risk it deserves to be rewarded. Most do not use them now at all. Ore anomalies in high pop space is going untouched for days. Take a roam and look for yourself.
---
Ore prices are rising, Plex prices are as well. Was it that good?
---
He blued the hot pockets. This image is amazing.

yes

Where's the invuln for my 5b golem? Sure would be handy so as not to get vollied by a super on the 1st shot.
---
Honestly? Because it is immersion destroying bullshit. It doesn't even scale correctly compared to BS vs Cruiser level application. 
---
Cap vs subcap warfare is probably the most broken aspect of the game at this point. It shouldn't even be a thing outside of medium to large scale fleet warfare. 
---
Get rid of HAW completely at the very least, caps should be subcap force multipliers.
---
I'm saying anybody who takes log in numbers as a viable metric for the health and profitability of a free to play game is foolish at best. People who log in and immediately log out don't spend money and any company that champions such numbers is just throwing out fluff that has no meaning and most modern game consumers know it. Unique log ins were only a viable marketing tool when people had to pay to play the game and this holds true for all games.
---
You spoke from the hearts and minds of so many legacy eve players. The eve of our time created a player base that keeps playing for 10-15 years. The new eve was creating a revolving door of 1-3 years. 
---
Bless you
---
&gt; A one month sub with cash costs $10-14. 500 plex costs $19.99. PLEXing makes much more money for CCP than subscribed accounts.
---
In my experience, the people that buy PLEX from CCP do so anyways.  Better conversion rates probably do result in more purchases, but high PLEX prices also remove some buyers from the market so it likely isn't a big factor.  I used to keep 8 accounts subbed, I now keep ~4-5 subbed.
---
TLDR;  I don't agree because those 30 rorq accounts jack up the price of PLEX for others.  Sure some buy more PLEX from CCP because of better conversion, but that is cancelled out by people PLEX'ing less accounts due to higher prices (like me).
---
A few weeks ago someone said
---
"It should be structures &gt; subcaps &gt; caps &gt; structures"
---
I think it's a good starting point. But ultimately I think the problem is the "one pilot per ship" design. In actual combat, taking down a capital ship isn't just taking down an expensive and powerful asset, but killing hundreds of enemies. It's a massive hit to morale and skill. 
---
Now that won't work in EVE, but what if there was a say to emulate that? Take the SP loss mechanic out of T3Cs and move it to capitals. Then multiply it by A LOT.
---
so you don't mine, you don't haul and you don't hunt... What's left, ratting?  Or are you just one of these people who don't play but still post about how things should be in the game? 
---
Losing cargo space is hardly a drawback compared to whats needed to counter such a shitty module, would you so whole heartily recommend this module if it made your align time greater on a hauler?  I don't think so because then there would actually be a drawback that matters, as there is with every module needed to counter it
---
I didn't necessarily phrase it that way, but I was speaking for myself. The most recent set of Rorq nerfs led me to stop using mine for mining (still take it out for boosts, but not sieged), and I'm certainly not taking the Nid out during the Blackout. For the moment, I'm actually doing PI, Abyssal sites, exploration, and T2 industry (which the exploration feeds into) as replacement income. So my Ishtar, which I've lost in the past while actively ratting, is no longer out there for the taking.
---
People *will* always krab. They'll always bot too. But mechanical changes will affect these activities at the margins, and my post presupposes that the current blackout will affect them negatively. If it turns out ratting/mining was unaffected, there's no reason to even consider the insta-refit. The suggestion was merely a way of keeping Blackout conditions even if the numbers fell, which CCP would frown on.
---
Dont join the large corps.
---
Funny when krabs salt the roads for danger on Eve. 
---
How miopic do you have to be to not understand the concept of Eve and how it differs from the other mmos? 
---
undock = unsafe
---
unsafe = Eve
---
safe = carebear mmo
---
carebear mmo != Eve
---
Cant tell if bait or null drone at this point
---
After being burned so many times by hot pockets, I'd set those bitches red. Gonna eat them anyway.
---
Wow! Nice! Works!
---
Trading is very difficult in EVE due to the slim margins you would have to have a lot of ISK to invest in order to gain a decent profit on the other hand if you want to try other means of earning ISK I suggest you skill up for a Gila and start doing Abyssal sites they offer very good ISK for little risk as long as you avoid doing T5 sites.
---
To give you an example I run T4 gamma abyssal sites takes 15 minutes to do average income is 35 mil and you get a chance at T2 skill books which can be worth 400+ mil.
---
Delete jita local. Problem solved
---

---
Really hope this is a long hard sale.
---
DnG are acceptable people.
---
All the NS entrance systems! If you look at that from like 2016-Now, I wonder if they‚Äôd still be that high since a lot of them don‚Äôt have constant camps now
---
&gt; Keep in mind that "PLEX'ing" doesn't actually put money in CCP's pocket and they don't care if a guy that runs 30 PLEX'd Rorqs quits. It just means that PLEX prices on the in game market will go down for once.
---
"PLEX'ing" refers to buying PLEX from the in game market, NOT CCP.  Buying game time directly from CCP is generally referred to as subbing, and selling PLEX on the market is just "selling PLEX".
---
I used the term correctly.
---
How is not wanting to spend an hour mashing whatever keybind you have for dscan in order to rat back whatever PVP ship you lost and to be as aware as your enemies risk-averse?  It's very easy to bring enough firepower to level the beefiest T1 subcaps before even in-system backup can arrive and that's assuming someone's on-station for that exact purpose, doing nothing else during that time.  Let alone that someone can do that AND not be seen by people sitting on gates.
---
You might be doing it wrong
---
Then they aren't pvpers, they are just pve'ers who log in for n+1 blob fights. 
---
The most overused cringe worthy thing I hear people say "I just run sites to fund my pvp". Bull shit. Every single person who's ever said this in my presence, had done far and away more PVE than PVP. They typically shy from risky engagements and cry the loudest when the most garbage fits die. 
---
they aren't pvpers, just pve'er who want to try and look cool.
---
the downvoting is real. it's hilarious how stupid people can be, and reddit sure delivers a lot of examples. stay strong mate.
---
This is the most amazing thing to be produced by this sub. Holy shit +1
---
Just created an account so :P
---
well congratulations, you found another idiot who doesn't know the difference between "indefinite" and "infinite". now what?
---
Annnnnndddddd.....no one cares
---
Fake news you say!
---
I hope so too. Just moved to China, my connection is complete shite.
---
I want your FC
---
If you say so...
---
My super cost 20bn it should be able to one-shot subs. Wtf ccp unsubbing
---
Hes got such a way with words
---
I'd be willing to bet its the goons that don't interact with anyone and are just there to mine, unlike how everyone else would like to put it I'm sure most goon members are taking advantage of the blackout and are figuring out how to adapt.
---
Utter garbage. Why should I adapt. It‚Äôs a game. If the game changes and I don‚Äôt like the change, I will vote with my feet. Simple.
---
I don't know how much you roam, but I have played the game since 2011, and sov is too damn safe right now.  Pre-blackout, a typical roam consisted of being on local/intell 100% of the time and basically failing to catch people unless they were 100% AFK, unlucky, or awful.  Local itself meant that FCs could pretty much avoid any fight they could lose.  Blackout means that FCs no longer have perfect intel and are more prone to making mistakes, that result in content.  Tons more honestly.
---
That's a good ping, would totally join his fleet.
---
I love Delonewolf he is awesome.
---
I would say for the most part I agree with you, however I think the blackout helps accomplish one goal that you didn't list. 
---
4.) Stop players from having perfect information
---
It kind of ties in with your 1st point but I think having the ability to 99% of the time avoid unwanted players has had a detriment in a game that is all about the social interaction between players.

I‚Äôm OOTL, what‚Äôs the blackout?
---
I was more in line with 'they migrate out of eve to other subs too?'
---
Guys you shouldn't engage with your leet pvp. Leet pvp content bad. Miner man sad.
---
This gave me a good laugh.
---
Yup, he lost a Magnate.
---
They dropped a fleet on a Magnate.
---
internet explorer yes hello

Dont stress over skills, a major part is execution and engaging properly. You can blap a blingy garmur in a 1 day old thrasher if you land a good scram on him.

Posting this extended exercise in sarcastic applause makes you look worse than someone smugging about killing some rollers, tbh.

well DUH, everyone got hyped, logged in to see that everyone is docked and its less content than before - thats it
---
ccp thinks that sp rewards will keep people subbed. LOL
---
DnG are (probably) people
---
My 400b frig doesn't get an invuln timer
---
And yet w-space was supposed to be the 'extra-scary-more-dangerous-than-null-but-no-carrier-drops-so-less-dangerous-than-null' area.  Also sometimes you're on when the rest of your group isn't.  Should at that point, someone simply fuck off to hisec or something every time there's a lull then put in another however many jumps back once someone gets on? Better yet, simply not play EVE? That's a one-way ticket to content loss and small groups getting booted from null, which I'm pretty sure isn't CCP's intent.
---
I said in a non bubble scenario. Bubbles don't stop you cynoing in, anyway.
---
Cyno inhibs should be a counter but they're not because they're so bad. Making cyno inhibs actually be a counter to cynos would be a good move.
---
Agreer. I live in null sec, guess what. I like the change. My whole Corp does, all I see are positive comments in Alliance chat. That guy can fuck off we the "we" comment.
---
You do realize that GSF is FOR the local changes, right?
---
C4 Space best space.

when you're immortal some vacuum walks could be just another hobby. Considering the floating dead corpses around Jita, I'd say its more common than most people realize...

I'll fight Falcon next year if I get around to actually playing

Lets see how CCP and the current player base adapts to less income and less players.

I'm in the top 20? Clearly, I have failed to impart the proper degree of zealotry in my posting. I'll need to be even more severe in the future.
---
I do a bit of everything I'm not one of those people who can manage to do the same thing for years and years on end, that's probably how most of you end up so crazily focused on your own profession.
---
Saying it's hardly nothing to lose as much cargo space as is needed to fit enough stabs to make a difference shows how much you know about hauling.
---
Why did you assume I've never hunted? Because I don't agree with you? Lmao
---
It's pretty straight foward and balanced, the more slots you sacrifice the better your chances are at either performing the disrupt or blocking it. It's a 1:1 ratio and hunters can even fit scrams which exceed that 1:1, why do you want victory handed to you on a silver platter?
---
You could never catch anyone who was paying attention and didn't want to be caught, with local. What those destroyed ratting ships prove is that lots of people don't pay attention.
---
Local in nullsec works like local in wormholes now, aka nobody shows up unless they talk.
---
There is no legitimate reason to have multiple reddit accounts.
---
Amusing, but to put it in perspective...I have seen many ‚ÄúI am gonna subscribe if this is permanent‚Äù comments, which means the Not Crabs also unsubbed.  Face it, Eve has a lot of players who unsubscribe when someone touches their e-peepee.
---
We did a 40 jump null roam in Battleships and no one touched us... apparently 6x t1 BS fleet is scary...
---
Okay Satan.
---
I retract my previous statement.
---
No, in fact if you've been following the threads about this you'll see that I support a long delay to the ESI endpoints feeding killmails.
---
Even the hot pockets are blued lmao
---
Turtle necks is serious business
---
so, meanwhile you understand that almost any subcap can avoid HAW damage and all you need is just 3 Ab  logi or something for emergency and you will bring it down with maybe 7 dreakavaks or something
---
The 3 thousand buffs to safe pve in nullsec probably.

There once was a man from ~~Nantucket~~ *Delve*

    Ran away with a ~~man~~ /u/ccp_falcon

---
Personally I had unsubscribed out of boredom.  This change gives me tons of new ideas and tactics for the game.  If EVE is overrun by people that threaten to unsub for any change that hurts them and CCP caves then this game probably isn't for me and is long past redemption.
---
I for one welcome our new memelords
---
Oh that sounds awesome, might have to get back into the game and head back to null sec now
---
I'm trying hard??! You're literally trying to stay relevant by following my posts around and attempting ~sick burns~ every opportunity you get. Responding to my posts is the only way you get recognition from anyone now days, my have the shitlords fallen...
---
That would remove any possibility of eating a dread bomb. Why would a group risk losing billions of sp to kill a single titan/super?
---
Okay, Xenuria wins.
---
[Fewer](http://tribzap2it.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/game-of-thrones-stannis-fewer.gif?w=500&amp;h=277) accounts, or even people playing the game does not mean that CCP will make less.  It's all about plex and subscription purchases.  In that context, there's an influx of players who are buying subs and plex, and an _alleged_ efflux of players who do a lot of PvE, making them more likely to actually pay for their accounts via purchasing plex from the market with isk.  Knowing how a permanent change to local will pan out for CCP's wallet is beyond your understanding, and mine, and CCP's, which is why they've described this as a trial run.
---
Read the blog marketsforisk. Once you finish, mail me in game and if you can answer a few questions to prove you internalized it, I‚Äôll give you some seed money. ign: Fisher Kel
---
Then I may try to recruit you if you also want to do some pvp. IMO trading and small gang or solo pvp are the best combination of activities in Eve. 
---
Good luck
---
damn, u/verybadateve @ 235 upvotes/comment
---
Cut Master Race reporting.
---
Poor uncut losers and their dick cheese.
---
Well, I beg to differ . Some of the most hardcore PvP'ers that I've met in the game are also hardcore PvE'ers , and no they are not F1 monkeys . They do small gang / solo work. As for their methods of PvE , for them most of them it includes smartbomb ratting (paired with DED site running and manufacturing , as it totally makes sense ) and mass PI (if you can call it PvE , i suppose you can) . I have to admit that most of them also do trading paired with this.
---
I've met some that indeed were spending real $  for PLEX that they sold on market for their PvP need , but those were very few . What stuck in my mind was one dude that used to do this and had himself a faction titan and a couple of other normal ones , running a ton of accounts (various subcapital alts, JF pilot, etc.). I wonder how much $ he invested into this game during the years \^\^
---
Yes! About the cheap pricks with a 2m payout for hauling 1b in collateral 15 jumps. Moving that shit has to be worth the risk so pay a fair wage you douchebag.
---
Holy crap, he started blogging again! But start st the beginning of his old posts imo
---
it's what's keeping them alive.
---
You're right. Starting ISK cost is too high. Ty
---
fun starts when blackout ends
---
I would like to think that isn't the case but I'm scared you could be right
---
10\10 bait. Reddit circle jerk triggered. Good job op üëç
---
doing "anything whatsoever" won't fix the problems.
---
that's what the thread is about.
---
Ty for the effort for this post but all of this is well known and you dont delve into any of the underlying mechanics that these problems stemmed from.
---
No. Bullshit. If I don‚Äôt like the game and changes I go. Simple. I do not have to play the game like you want me to. Who are you to tell me how to play EvE?

Nerf bulkheads and rebalance t1 base hp towards their preferred tanks.

Give me 10,000 words on why the blackout was actually the Mittani's idea and is meant to benefit goons - and have it on my desk by the end of the day.

Yes. Absolutely yes.
---
This has been your daily jita manip post.
---
Record it.  We would love the entertainment.
---
10b and you can have him
---
because they see lot of ppl say they make a break in Eve for wow or just leave for wow.
---
Yeah.
---
Also, nerf the Comet, the Worm, and the Garmur.
---
Good stuff. Let's fight then.
---
You're going to need to think about this for a second. If no one PLEX'd accounts, what would people that buy PLEX with real life money do with it? They sell PLEX for isk to use in game. Where does that isk come from? There aren't NPC orders you can sell PLEX to. Your gut feeling about how PLEX fundamentally works is wrong.
---
Sure if you are giving up this early maybe this game isn't for you then
---
So in that case you can do t4's with a slightly blinged Gila. I've done t3's in a Gila with t2 mods with 5min left, but t4's are much harder than t3's so I'd suggest you look through guides about those sites. There are Reddit posts about players doing 50 t4 and t5 filaments so you should look at them
---
i love that al the null-sec corps are getting fucked for like they fucked with new players
---
now some corps are whining but its a ,PVP GAME,
---
I would have added citadels and especially tethering for making space so much safer and pretty much killing Blackops
---
Those and the hookbill / state of rockets need a look. I appreciate that rockets are viable now, but 5 mids was balanced around rockets being useless.
---
How the fuck will I ever be able to beat the u/catlos dickbutt?!!
---
Rather sure that the bulk of the people ganking and griefing high seccers are indeed also high seccers doing war decs and station games and all that.
---
It‚Äôs literally every day they‚Äôre in esoteria
---
Yeah I think most goons have been having fun with home defense and with scouting enemies out, etc. I know a lot of covert ops gangs have been running around using wormholes from our space.
---
But if theres a lot of people inside goons that arent connected with the community and fall behind/on comms that is kind of on them, and they arent really goons, they're drifters more or less.
---
GAS THE WEEBS
---
Maybe if you modern minds communicated ideas and information with your players as often as you advertise your cash shop bullshit, we wouldn't be left to speculate in a vacuum. I mean, sure, we'd still do it; but we'd have actual information to go on.
---
It‚Äôs a game. If you don‚Äôt enjoy it you move on. I have been playing since 2005. Before you were born. So don‚Äôt give me giving up bull shit. It is choice. You vote with your wallet and your feet.
---
Null sec corp checking in.  Our guys are loving blackout, with the exception of a couple people.  190+ active chars this week which is up from pre-Blackout.  If we're getting fucked, you will need to tell me which orifice, because I don't see or feel it.
---
Before the invuln you never got to shoot Rorquals except when they were jumping because they always hug a POS shield and boosting didn't require the industrial core.
---
Literally resubbed and joined goons this week *because* of the blackout.
---
If only it was actually delayed.
---
Instead, we get WH local for the kids. It's okay though, I really enjoy dropping supers on literally anything and everything now.
---
Crap. Okay, then is Omega something that I pay for only once and access everything or like a continuous subscription thing where I need to keep paying to have access?
---
What kind of a friend hands over a starter 5 billion isk, lol.
---
Something like "jewing" translated into Russian sounds like "krab" so with all the Russian bots it became a meme.
---
\^This. It's totally disingenuous to say that PvP playstyle is getting a buff and people who don't like PvP get nothing. The risk averse crowd has been getting spoon fed changes, leaving those who like to blow stuff up out in the cold for a couple of years, now. I've been on a break for the past 6 months, thought I had really finally won eve, but now I'm reading about this blackout and thinking about whether I should come dust some ships off...
---
Real humans lost focus, they forget to check local, they have reaction times, etc. Do people really think that there aren't that many bots in null? That real people have instant reaction times and rat for 23 hours a day?
---
I have a few friends in smaller null groups and a character in a larger null group. This is the general consensus that I am getting too.
---
Hurr durr goons bad.
---
Retard alert!
---
Pfft. Another typical krab trying to pretend he is just out there in his Rorq so he can build more PvP ships.
---
I think the quantity and quality of counters are total shit and the whole thing is broken as fuck. That's it.
---
Yeah, its a choice, and you are choosing to give up instead of learning to adapt.
---
Good ol' HS... that place scares the shit out of me.

We aren't though. Majority of real players enjoy the blackout
---
You've been living under a spodumain in the last week or what
---
Dank times, you mean
---
Uhhh, less mining means less isk, which means pay for your subscription as opposed to crabbing for it.  They take out the industry, you gotta pay to play.
---
Yeah... but you can't build those in the hole when they die.
---
This is pretty fucking cringy, jesus.
---
tbh when i seen this data w while ago i am trying hard to post less....., much less
---
Its worse than that - who would want to fly a glorified battering ram that is only useful for attacking walls? That's boring.
---
In actual warfare, people have jobs, and the outcome matters. This is a game, every role a human plays needs to be fun in some way (thats' why I still cannot comprehend mining in eve). That makes balancing more complicated, as a role that would be good for balance might be horribly un-fun.
---
I'm not seeing any null corps upset, just a few people, most are having fun with it or adapting. It is the way of Eve. Highsec is looking like a fat target for a lot of people with throwaway alts and great knowledge of game mechanics, shipping routes, etc. Be sure you keep undocking from your "high security" stations with all your raddest toys.
---
And better yet, this dude has done more in Eve than a lot of people. He took and held his own wormhole for a bit, even built a carrier in it with his brother. Went out with a bang All this dude does is have fun...
---
Well maybe if they do more than play lip service to their customers we‚Äôll be blessed with more variety

I want to upvote this because it is painfully true and there is a flair saying downvote this and mods can't tell me what to do.

One thing is making it more dangerous and the other is making it stupidly dangerous.

I was playing eve and I killed a ship during blackout.

DnG are definitely not robots
---
I usually hate on you but this is great. :)

It is a subscription. 15 dollars a month, although if you buy the year long version it‚Äôs a bit cheaper, only about 12 dollars a month. Not sure how it varies if you live outside of the us, regional pricing has been changing
---
$15 a month.
---
wow, very precise...
---
worth the read and thanks for the perspectives o7
---
&gt; just once, others should have to adapt as well
---
Are you saying that Null hasn't been nerfed in the past?
---
And the thing is, as you practice more you'll get better and faster and begin to learn the lay of the land.
---
You could also argue that combined karma is the best metric. Either way, naz is #1. That list completely changed when you expand it to top #50 however.
---
You don't have to win Eve. You can adapt to the changes. Don't think multi rorq is your thing now? Then do single. Too juicy a target, then downgrade and get back on a ret. Why do you need so much money anyways? You can always have fun with less. If your fun comes from mining then what difference does it make if you get 1 trit or 1 billion?
---
If a small Corp/alliance suffers from not having a big enough umbrella to support a rorq op then they shouldn't complain. They are not big enough, period. 
---
End-game content is not supposed to come easy and should always evolve. CCP saw that end-game null didn't pose any challenges so they are stirring it up.
---
End-game content in Eve right now is being able to multi rorq, multi bash and massive ctas. If you are not happy with it or how the game enables you to do it then maybe Eve is not what you are looking for anymore.
---
I've seen l33t pvprs that played for years that left Eve because of the finality of the pvp aspect of the game. It is not bad, it's just life. People change. The game is also changing.
---
Delonewolf might be a carebear who lives in Hisec, but he used to live in a wormhole. I've watched the dude for years, his wormhole diaries was brilliant. Him and his brother took and held a wormhole, they built battleships, ran sites and even built a Carrier in it. Went out with a bang and he now has his own little empire. 
---
His fits are ridiculous and he doesn't use hotkeys. But watch his stuff, he doesn't care, he has fun. Listening to how excited he gets when losing things and finishing sites and everything else. Fun is 100% what this dude gets out of Eve. No killboard shenanigans, no "I'm better at solo PvP", no sourness over losses. It's genuinely nice to see someone have that much fun.
---
Delay doesn't remove the information in talking about.
---
Even if it delayed 24 hours, you would still have historical records of fits, friends, and active times. This let's you know what you are going to deal with at no cost.
---
Limit force projection
---
Give small groups a reason to exist
---
General function pass on ship class lines, currently a cruiser is the most dangerous subcap ship in the game. This is a mistake. Battleships are laughable. 
---
Kitey speed meta is the only meta, make brawling great again. 
---
Reduce respawn rate on ore anoms to roughly 6x slower and stop nerfing mining ships, hunters have all the advantages outside of a mega alliance dropping supers. Hell, if someones gonna be stuck in one spot, give them proper yields for it. a 5-ish bil ship that roughly makes 100 mil an hour while stuck and using fuel every rolling 5 minutes is meaningless if a 800 mil ship can make 25 mil an hour and never put itself in danger. Or you can just anom rat and make more money while spending less.
---
not to the point where they had to adapt beyond making more alts of x in order to make the same profits
---
That's one hell of a niche, metal is so complicated
---
&gt; we get WH local for the kids
---
&gt;I really enjoy dropping supers on literally anything
---
There's really nothing adequately witty I can say to your post to make you out to be an even bigger cuck than you've already made yourself out to be. So on that note, have a wonderful day :)

&gt; If no one PLEX'd accounts
---
It's a dynamic system.  If prices drop, people will PLEX that would not otherwise.  There is always a floor.  Removing bots and mass multiboxing would simply mean less demand for PLEX, which will bring down prices.  Will slightly less people buy PLEX from CCP if 500 PLEX gets them 2bill instead of 2.2bill?  Sure.  Does it change the overall trend?  Not at all.
---
&gt; Your gut feeling about how PLEX fundamentally works is wrong.
---
Your feeling is right, it is the magnitude of the effect which is wrong.  This makes you wrong.  You ignore the fact that things are not static.  Price changes change behavior on both sides of the transaction.
---
&gt; If no one PLEX'd accounts, what would people that buy PLEX with real life money do with it?
---
This will only happen when Eve dies, so who cares.  It's just a silly scenario that I can't even see happening ever.
---
He called in the 'casino war' downvote.
---
Eve comes from an age when stats down to the smallest number mattered.  This game is filled with numbers and knowing what they mean is Important.  Games today don't have that much diversity. They walk you through a set path and hand you appropriate rewards as you progress along the way. Eve requires a large part of that path to be driven by player motivation.
---
&gt; You really thought they wouldn't come here?
---
No?
---
R/eve actually doesn't get it nearly as bad as political subreddits. I have other subs set up to autoban accounts from /r/thesefuckingaccounts. Never really felt the need to set that up on r/eve
---
Aww, I like the guy, I'm not really interested in the topics of his videos, yet I'm still subscribed and watching him sometimes.
---
Yeah. It would be, I think that's why they introduced station containers though.
---
How about the Jump Fatigue change causing the blocs to consolidate and abandon a bunch of space that wasn't defensible anymore.
---
You fucking blues the hot pockets Lmao
---
Truer Memes were never said.
---
As someone who subs quite a few accounts and pays for Plex, I disagree. CCPs bottom line will reflect the changes soon enough.
---
I think by now I'm here for life.
---
Thats a lot of words to say you're giving up.

---
If a titan is gonna die, it's gonna die with or without that DC. Put it on something where it will actually make a difference.
---
We're literally closer to 2020 than 2018.
---
the multiple accounts is not bad i just should not be a needed thing. just a convenience  thing but is need in most cases.
---
Follow-up: Could you have made a shittier clickbait title!?
---
It‚Äôs really not complex.  It‚Äôs made to feel complex by CCP because they deliberately leave out tutorials for a lot of the core activities in the game.  It‚Äôs ‚Äúcomplex‚Äù in the same way WoW was thought of as complex back in 2005 because people didn‚Äôt know what they were doing.
---
Balls. And as soon as I stop paying I lose all access to everything Omega related, right?
---
you realise they are infact goons, well goons 2019, the point of our alliance is to mass recruit anyone and feed off their taxes, the fact its too easy to get paps means any anti-social crab can thrive here, which is what leadership wants.
---
You're pretty cringy
---
Rah
---
This is unironically why I stopped playing EVE and won't pick it up until the requirement of having alts is gone.
---
So what you're saying is, you're not just a shit cobbling cunt on this sub, but also on others? Got it, you're just a cunt.
---
Ok
---
By shitposting on reddit but not logging in?
---
"but he used to live in a wormhole"
---
til wormholes somehow make you a better person
---
I think you misunderstand. 
---
This was a shitpost.
---
You‚Äôre right, the only three things the activity tracker measures are NPC kills, player kills, and jumps.
---
shut up badik
---
Get out of here you krab
---
Require multiple pilots to properly operate a Super/Titan.
---
It would be like playing Star Trek Bridge Crew.
---
oh yeah i just re read it now its not even about what i think it was, i was talking about eve accounts  lol. i should go to bed
---
maybe he meant 'stalwart' :P
---
Not sure if bait or actually retarded.
---
Oh, throwaway reddit account. Got it.
---
I don‚Äôt have anything against the guy? I‚Äôm just pointing out eve has never been this dope cause everyone is taking advantage of the blackout.
---
I go for bigger targets, much bigger.
---
DnG are.
---
Hmmm I wonder how many of us are on SSRIs..... I‚Äôm on Zoloft .
---
imagine playing eve, one of the worse pve designed games, to pve all day
---
Soo the handful of alliances capable of assembling big enough super fleet could just delete smaller alliances? Sure why not.
---
&gt;cant come up with any counter argument so just spews some retard shit
---
Oh test...
---
Can you actually tell me why I‚Äôm retarded?
---
Natch.
---
I thought I had won the game, but alas i was pulled back by another clone into another vivid awakening inside the station. Apparently some form of disruption had kept me and much time had passed; invasions and attacks not just limited to the Sansha.
---
Immediately I checked my contacts. All friends. All in their own forms of stasis, perhaps some would awaken later through the day but i would not notice. A new individual had piqued my interest based on solo exploits of holding his own system. The Tribute Carribean. Curious, I reached out and introduced myself - seeking improvement in the style of play i never really succeeded in; self sufficiency.
---
While he could turn away a pilot, would he turn away someone with so many skills? Opposing stasis 'timezones' meant we would be not seeing a whole lot of one another not unlike a tale of romance tens of thousands of years ago between two feuding families, but this lifestyle quickly enamored me and i sought to proove capable. We took the constellation between us and aggressively fought back against any who would wish to engage us, we became confident in our system where we could bait and kill just about any gang 2-3 times our size. Slowly, more members - newer ones, began to trickle in and grow from 2 to perhaps a half dozen. They too were invaluable in controlling the battlefield with their speed, webs and points - allowing our battleships and otherwise to reign hell back on our would-be victors.
---
Then something shifted in the air as the local channel shimmered, news of the invasion in hisec having effects on nullsec were felt. This was fine; as a small entity we could be ignored. As the strongest entity in the region, we were respected. That was until our neighbours showed up. Though we were keen to fight; we quickly realized not only did they not want to fight numbers similar to our own, but they were fighting 6:1. Their cloakers kept watchful eye, living only a system from our homebase meant they were capable of undocking and engaging with any activity.
---
Though I was skeptical of their speed, skill or inability to fight on even terms - I undocked my Ishtar in order to make the isk needed for future projects. Curiously, I spotted some drones on my scan and investigated. They were worth the time, given no market existed out here and quickly they were scooped - then i set about destroying the 'rats' that had tried to destroy them. Only a single wave of enemies could be killed, before i spotted a ship on scan. A Malediction. I knew they were fast and often used as tackle, but had no idea how tanked the ship could be. And since I was fitted to resist such a small gunned ship, I made the decision to stay and bait him.
---
Ten minutes later, he finally figured out where i was and landed practically on top of my ship - 20km was nothing for such a fast and agile frigate and while i was aligned towards a safe spot, I was confident I could kill him before inevitable backup were to arrive. Sure enough, he pointed me. And in turn i set my fastest drones onto him. Within a second, his shield was gone and his armour was at half. An osprey on scan. I can kill him fast enough, right? It was when a sabre, navy brutix and four more joined the osprey that I decided to kick the warp into gear, abandoning my drones to their fate. A warp core stabilizer worked overtime; fitted for exactly this reason of avoiding 'the gank'. Just as the osprey landed, I was off. Once my weapons timer expired, I warped to station where they'd assumed I had gone. With a smile I linked up with the station weapons as they retreated. This left both of us a little disappointed.
---
Perhaps I shouldn't of taunted them in local with my admittance of only wanting to see if i could kill the one ship, before others arrived. They appeared to take it in good spirits, though not an hour later they once more flexed their numbers as a small team of Lesheks began to strike at our home and shake my TV. Their tank would not be broken by so few guns, but i did spot another oddity in the system - a Revelation. Undocking; i headed to the other station - this one with far bigger and more weapons at its disposal and opened fire on the mighty beast, but alone it was clear he would eventually win.
---
Defeated, I designed to simply troll him as he finally wished to depart with a bubble and watched as he eventually escaped. 
---
I had one the game once. And now i was deeply losing it.
---
I'll answer yours when you answer mine.
---
Oh, wait... you have no answer, which is why you pulled that non-sequitor question out of your ass.  We weren't talking about turning local back on, we were talking about all corporations being exactly the same and being impacted by this change the exact same way.... which is absolute bullshit, and you know it.  Or should know it if you've spent more than 5 minutes playing EVE.

FC's Personal Log, First Entry ‚Ä¶. Did I just witness a Titan die without whoring on it?
---
So here I am a newly appointed FC of TEST... what the hell did I sign up for?
---
I‚Äôve just pinged for my first ever fleet‚Ä¶ 16 hours into the Blackout‚Ä¶ 
---
I ping for a gate camp up in Esoteria in hopes of catching some small hostile gangs that might be roaming around trying to catch TEST ratters &amp; miners. My Kitchen Sink / Non-Doctrine gate came quickly attracts about 30 guys. We‚Äôre all sitting there‚Ä¶ shooting the shit on coms talking about random things‚Ä¶ The Intel Map lights ups and the sound of PGL saying ‚ÄúYou should get the fuck out‚Äù rings loud. A TEST Bro in a Domi has just had a run in with a Phantasm, a VNI, and a Curse‚Ä¶ Shit were only 4 jumps away and that system is a closed loop‚Ä¶ I split my camp up into 2 groups, group 1 takes the same route the 3 hostiles are taking, and group 2 gets 2 jumps in front of them via jump bridges. Group 1 pushes the 3 hostiles into group 2‚Ä¶. Here we go boys‚Ä¶ The VNI Decloaks and warps before a Stiletto can get a lock‚Ä¶ wtf oh no this is not good‚Ä¶ next... the Phantasm.. He deloaks‚Ä¶ WEB, SCRAM, POINT rings out‚Ä¶ oh shit boys we got him‚Ä¶. He melts quickly, a 1 bill Phantasm‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll take it Great work Boys! The Cruse, no doubt having leaned the fate of his friend decides not to jump in and warps off cloaked..
---
We return to our bubbles‚Ä¶ 20 minutes later, the Intel map lights up again, this time a Loki, Ishkur, Vagabond about 5 jumps out‚Ä¶ I call for all dessie down to go give chase, our Sabre manages to catch up to the Loki and Ishkur.. Bubble Up! The Ishkur is caught and we‚Äôre jumping in, out of some misguided loyality for his buddie the Loki decides to try to and help the Ishkur get out of the bubble, ‚ÄúPOINT ON THE LOKI‚Äù yells out one of my figs.. we decimate the Ishkur and the Loki.. Respectable kills.. 500m loki not bad‚Ä¶ then the pod gets posted, opps someone forgot to get out of their training clone‚Ä¶ a full set of +5‚Äôs, a 500m pod, way to go guys!
---
We once again return to our bubbles, Eso is quiet not much is happening for about 30-40 mins, then it happens‚Ä¶. ‚ÄúUhhh there‚Äôs something big going down in Impass‚Äù rings out in coms‚Ä¶ I respond with ‚ÄúWhat do you mean something big?‚Äù one of my guys replies back with ‚ÄúSomething about a Titan Tackled in Impass‚Äù, I quickly look up the system, ‚Äúwell shit boys that‚Äôs only 12 or so jumps.. lets go‚Äù. We start burning, about 6 jumps out‚Ä¶ a ping goes out ‚Äú LOG IN ANTI CAPITAL LOAD OUT TITANT ON GRID‚Äù‚Ä¶ Oh shit boys its real, free burn as fast as you can! The Cap FC‚Äôs have just commandeered my fleet room and begin yelling out commands to caps, I go up to the FC room.. ‚ÄúUmm Command, my gate camp fleet is about 4 jumps out, we have dictors and a kitchen sink fleet..‚Äù a stern voice yelled back, I believe it may have been Vily ‚ÄúGet them there now keep going go go go‚Äù I return to the fleet coms‚Ä¶ ‚Äúok boys this is the real deal there is a Titan on grid and were going to go help tackle it! 
---
I‚Äôm the first one in system, I have 3-4 dictors right behind me and a few more 1-2 jumps back. There are two cynos in system‚Ä¶ I tell my boys that I warping to one of them, wish me luck.. I don‚Äôt want to die to a blinding light I hear on coms ‚Äúwe‚Äôre right behind you FC‚Äù‚Ä¶ I arrive on field.. well fuck me there‚Äôs a titan here, full armor! I jump to command coms Command there‚Äôs a titan here and it‚Äôs bubbled‚Ä¶  Command replies‚Ä¶.. However at the time I don‚Äôt remember what they said, because in the time it took me to land on field, switch to command coms and target the Titan it had gone from full armor to dead‚Ä¶ my heart sunk‚Ä¶. I didn‚Äôt get a shot off‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not going to be on that kill‚Ä¶  
---
Completely bummed out, we all meet up 1 jump out in 68FT gate and discuss how we just missed getting on a Titan Kill by mere seconds... we're all a little disappointed when all of a sudden a small gang consisting of a  Loki,Curse,Stiletto,Lachesis,Drekavack and Rapier come to our gate... WTF... "BUBBLE UP NOW!, DON'T AGRESS, Lock Them Up!"... They all Jump into IRE.. " JUMP JUMP JUMP" what was just a moment of shitty luck has now turned into a nice little flight.... We manage to lock down all but the rapier, and kill/pod them... a 1.5b Loki, a 400m Curse, a 60m Stiletto, a 600m Lachesis, a 650m Drek, and oh boy... a 1.5b Pod.... Oh my... The mood turns from disappointment to "Holy Shit FC that was the most fun we've had in weeks"

I make all of my isk in high sec. In Jita 4-4. Can count it into the hundreds of billions. 0 changes have impacted negatively on my income. Abyssal stuff? Made me soooooo much money. All those people buying blowing up my purple mods don't leave me complaining at all. So go ahead and let scrubs think their 15m ticks with VNIs are anything but a drop in the bucket, because when they do they always leave me laughing my way to the bank.
---
It's merely a statement that he's not always been a 'hisec carebear'... Read into it whatever the hell you please, but don't put words into my mouth.

The dude has fun, that's all there is to it. He doesn't care about kills or losses or the areas of space he flies in.

---
The structures to turn local back on through sov are in the game files and have been. The only reason ccp is probably gun shy to release them is they have shit timing and they know delve local will be back online because goons have the best logistics in the game.
---
Sorry you were mutilated as a baby
---
So the handful of alliances capable of assembling big enough super fleets can't already delete smaller alliances?
---
Yeah I know right?  Fuck those guys let‚Äôs run them off.
---
Back to work, there's a plane you have to make sure stays grounded.
---
Remember when Dreddit was the Reddit corp and goons couldn't just crush us with bots?
---
Jesus christ how did you know I was a plane mechanic
---
https://imgur.com/a/foNPSsa
---
Yep. Because if you did implement them goons would make no local not a thing. And you hate it when goons beat you at your own game because they do it all day everyday.
---
I've been having a great time dropping my super. Lots more content, more ratters dying, more people baiting and dropping the hunters.
---
Your MOS is in your name shitbird
---
I need to krab my wallet back into full power, but bait mastodon will definitely happen.
---
Correct.
---
Right I kinda forgot what I was named. Forgive my autism.
---
There you go again telling people how to play the game.
---
Dw pros and cons will reflect. Sign this non-rec
---
Well still better than pve in real life for some people vOv
---
https://i.imgur.com/JT9xm8q.jpg
---
Sigh. Okay.
---
Sure you can, I started EvE back in 2007 when I was 14 years old. There was no alpha back then so I am not sure how much that will affect you but for a long time I just did missions.
---
A bit dated now, but still entertaining: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPNxNwdje_8
---
Time to double up my shitposting for number 1 next year
---
&gt;We weren't talking about turning local back on
---
uh, yes we fucking well were.
---
That's not how i remember it and player count was twice as high.
---
I'm sorry? I think you mean AYE AYE CORPORAL
---
We'll played. Made me laugh. 7o
---
So show them the joys of EvE PvP. As someone who was PvE focused at first, they will thank you for it.
---
plex is not generated ingame, it's paid for by someone with real money; so, each alt that gets plexed is still real money for ccp; and last time i checked, a subscription costs 15 ‚Ç¨ per month (and even cheaper if you buy for multiple months at once), while 500 plex cost 20‚Ç¨. so, each subscription gives at most 15‚Ç¨ per month for ccp, while each plexed alt gives 20‚Ç¨ to ccp via a 3rd party that gets isk for their effort
---
Aye corporal! I actually picked up just before I got out last year. Oh well. At least I got to go on 3 deployments.
---
Because you are advocating for carebears and they aren't allowed to play EVE.
---
I am buying lots of blue salvage right now expecting a large price increase over the next few months.  I would hold anything you are bringing in for a couple weeks, you could double your pay.
---
It's perfect really. You can Lord it over the boots who don't ever have a chance to do a real deployment :)
---
Spend the 15 bucks. Pvp as much as you want and Buy dank ships with ISK as intended.
---
You're right about them earning money when plex is bought. You're wrong about them losing it when it's redeemed.
---
That makes sense. I just found his wording ‚Äúthe furthest‚Äù kinda crazy. In competent groups those 20 man armor fights involve, in my opinion, very similar degrees of communication and trust that you might find in a small gang.
---
Not really, it appears to be a russian corruption of "Carebear", and wholly unconnected to "jewing". 
---
It has the bonus of not being tied with casual racism so that's why it caught on.
---
Lots of negative people about the change affecting income, I wanted to give my feedback on why everyone will be able to make more isk in less time with the blackout.  No games, its all speculation
---
Just like real world freight rates...there‚Äôs always some douche driving a barely legal rust bucket willing to do anything to cover the rent.  A lot of times there is nothing you can do to compete...you can only get it there on time, other than that there‚Äôs a few customer facing things you can do but when too many are doing it, rates drop.  Solution, convince people to stay away from contract hauling, gank your competition etc.
---
I was definitely a senior salt dog lance corporal. Oh man I was a shit bag by the end of my third deployment. Corporals course corporals would be waiting outside the 7 day with their pizza stain ribbon. Ain't nobody got time for that. I'd walk in no shave like a real piece of shit.
---
Dirt 'n' Glitter speaks to me. 
---
Where is your main AO?
---
I'll check you guys out in game when I get home later.
---
Do we all seriously think a Super Cap umbrella is going to save a VNI when it lights a cyno?!  Ummm, no.   New players, you know the folks we ALL NEED TO KEEP THIS HAME GOING WHO CANT FLY SUPERS OR RORQS may as well move back to high sec.  There is no room for the casual Carebear (YA KNOW THE ONES WE ALL NEED TO INCREASE OUR POPULATION IN THE GAME) in null.  There is no such thing as HTFU if you can‚Äôt compete.   And if your not a member of PH or Karma, don‚Äôt even log in.  We‚Äôre clubbing the baby seals and soon there will be no more baby seals to club in null.
---
That‚Äôs not how that works. Inferior how? In making isk, maybe, but that‚Äôs literally the only angle I can see making sense here.
---
What if I have planetary infrastructure and I lose Omega. Do I no longer get anything from it and can't get to it?
---
You're full of yourself, there may be a small spike in meta modules and mineral prices are going to raise. But your making it sound like it's going to skyrocket. PLEX will stay under 4 mil for at least a few months until everyone adapts and null goes back to normal. This blackout really hasn't changed much beyond the fact I am not seeing bots everywhere in null. So far it's been a win-win but I will say if I wanted to live without local, I would live in a wormhole. So Roaming lowsec looking for some pew pew has been a change and I am finding interesting lowsec pockets in Derelik, Heimatar, &amp; Devoid. I never expected to see so many keepstars in lowsec. So come on people lets go explore lowsec together. moar pew pew plz
---
He keeps saying "vote with your feet" like it's some clever new slang, too. I don't get that. What is this supposed to be?
---
[Yes, please!](https://imgur.com/a/JgapvMM)
---
It‚Äôs better than doing nothing.
---
im buying about 50 items that i anticipate will jump based on what i wrote.   I do expect some things to tank as more people might flock to LS/HS to do sites and run abyssals
---
I've had 15+ alts for 16+ years, and I still suck.
---
Well hes not wrong. Carebears are gonna carebear.
---
If they cant carebear in Null they gonna do it somewhere else
---
Plex doesn't come from Rorqual miners and botters. Plex comes from new bros and people that get blownup and dont want to farm.  This is a generalization of course as of course many people do both and many people fund PVP through PVE.
---
This right there, is your answer OP. I've been doing relic without local in Whs, and you have to always be on your guard. Orbit 2500m and when you see someone, you cloak since you need a 2000m range to cloak, poof, your gone. Enjoy your explo ! :D
---
I haul myself friendo, and without the need for stabs.  
---
I assume you've never hunted because you clearly haven't tackled enough people to be frustrated by such a crappy mechanic.  Is it fun for you to spend time hunting a target (or as you say, have them presented to me on a silver platter) for them to escape without any need for any piloting skill or performing any kind of recon to avoid you?  I dont think so....  But hey, why not have the opposite and have a mod where i can tackle you without needing to work to get in range of you, lock you, and then apply my module, Maybe it could be a low slot where if im in range of you, you cant warp away.  No?  Seems unfair when its the other way around right?
---
carrier ratting is still a thing. a big thing.
---
but you need ot be under a super umbrella. look for a mega corp. we got 3 confirmed super umbrellas atm (test, goons...if you can call their super umbrella a super umbrella...its a bit to big for that small description,  and panfam)
---
Part of the complexity comes from the lack of baseline understanding of what a spaceship game should be when compared to what we think medieval fantasy should be.
---
Medieval fantasy is easy.  Helmet protects your head.   Sword kills people.   High sword skill kills people more better.  Your bag holds stuff.  There are a few numbers that let you compare your current sword with another, so you know which one you want to use.  And this all has some basis in reality, not to mention the reams of fantasy literature, that makes it tangible to us.
---
In EVE Online... how do I even get into this?  Every ship and module has a couple dozen stats.   None of it is as innately intuitive as "swing sword to kill orc."  All the ships and modules require a certain specific set of skills that you need to train and their performance is related to a whole range of additional skills which influence them.  And none of this may bear any relation to any science fiction literature you may have read, nor any other spaceship game you may have player, and certainly has little relation to anything NASA has going.
---
Actually my concerns are bumping machariel and kick out stations.
---
A lot of tutorial voice over. A big open amount of space. Lots and lots of menus and icons on the left hand side.  Ask lots of questions in rookie chat.
---
Man I miss this feeling so much. I wish I could become a newbro again.
---
Rigs dont drop so they never return to the market (like modules).  Way less people running NS sites will cause salvage loot to rise in price and that salvage loot is used to make T1/T2 rigs.    
---
More PVP + Less Relic site/salvage =  More rigs being destroyed and at a greater cost.  I am buying tons of salvage right now and have adjusted pricing on some large t2 rigs in anticipation
---
Except people would just form agreements to not kill them -.-
---
Do the tutorial, expect to die.
---
Expect people to try and scam you.
---
I recommend joining a good nullsec Corp because high security space is boring as fuck and kills off newer players. ( join a newbie Corp like brave newbies, karmafleet, horde or brand newbros. Braves the best but I leave the choice upto you)
---
Don't fly what you cannot afford to lose. 
---
Expect alot of waiting to fly what you'd like. Skills aren't instantaneous unless you use injectors.
---
EXPECT TO HAVE FUN! EvEs a great game op. Enjoy the ride.

That ‚Äúshitfit‚Äù rag was a standard drive by DD titan fit, very popular before titans were as plentiful as they are now

in early EVE, they were called "carebears".
---
Blackout  
---
people  saw this as a  meaning to return to old times  and then figure out that  with and witout blackout is still the same  point  , make it harder , sure why not
---
2 days really do not hurt , 3 days thinking , a week then yeah people will saw it different , then when you realized  not just the hunter ships will be expensive  , and then start complainint about price is too high  wooow then you realize  you need to  think before asking for wishes 
---
IT  is a change  noone is saying is not, is good or not well  depends how people see it  adapt or die , survival of stronger  lol  well  nice luck in the journey   now pick up new areas   to hunt cause after a week or two weeks null empires will be MORE  organized than before   much more thanks to the black out  and this will be thanks to you  
---
no cause the crow going  and looking the same direction means it is the right one to go

YESSSSSSSSSSSS ONE OF US! ONE OF US! ONE OF USSSSSSSSS!

"Won" EVE.
---
hahahahahahahahahahaha
---
a horrible new player tutorial.
---
it's the worst tutorial you'll ever experience. please don't give up.
---
I think a few very specific changes could make citadels far less oppressive to hunting. 
---
* Remove tether and replace with mooring (they mentioned this idea at EVE North). You do not auto moor, but start a 30 second count down like logging out. Mooring can be interrupted by combat. 
---
* Introduce a 60 second combat timer after shooting rats.  
---
* Make citadels like structures, you cannot dock with a combat timer but you can dock when your timer is over.  Sort of like station games of old.  
---
* Prevent a station from using it's weaponry if ships are moored.  Citadel pilot can deactivate mooring, meaning all of those ships can be killed. Woo spies!  
---
* Moored ships cannot bumped out of tether. Almost like logging out.
---
Really a big thing? Why not double the income in c3 or abyssals or burners in highsec? What do people really find under those fucking umbrellas?
---
I wasn‚Äôt making a point about your syntax.  I‚Äôm just telling you that fewer subscribers, whether they‚Äôre subscribed by *PLEXing* or by purchasing game time directly, means less revenue for CCP.  This idea shouldn‚Äôt really be in contention.
---
No because they arent doing that. They are just logging off the bots and not doing it. You can quantify that by looking at rating activity in period basis and deteroid. They are at an all time severe low for ratting numbers. Because they just arent logging in their bots.
---
[New player opening EVE for the first time (2019)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJBwwSB9g3U)
---
At 2500m orbit you will end up at 2600-2700, and when you open the can to get loot you will auto-approach, orbit at 2100-2200, you are far enough to cloak, and your ship will not auto approach at the end.
---
Never multiboxed.  It is fine without imo.
---
Or you could literally just look at the all time low for rating in bot rich regions to see that you are wrong. But people dont want to look at facts and evidence -.-
---
Set yourself reasonable goals
---
I didn't tell you how to play anything.
---
How did citadels kill blops?? Blops is fine...
---
Brainless ticks
---
Since you're clearly too stupid to remember, or to go back and read it, this is the post of yours I replied to:
---
&gt; "Just because it has minimal impact on the monolithic entities of their alliances, doesn't mean it doesn't affect them as individuals.
---
&gt; Example, if I suddenly got told neither me or my co-workers could work for more than 20hrs a week then the company would be fine, just double the amount of staff and plod on. I on the other hand would be fucked if I suddenly lost half my wages."
---
We are talking about the IMPACT the change has on players and alliances, and your stupid-ass analogy.  Not the actual change itself.  Fucking idiot.
---
Just some basic economic theories that i wanted to share and the reason I feel people will need to rat/farm less to make the same income.     
---
Where do you think all that botting isk goes?
---
Well I was ex goons so won't have problem .but just to know. What is an umbrella? You mean like the defense  region ?
---
The trailer combat scenes are fake as hell the gameplay is nothing like that.
---
... Wormholer, by the way....
---
Bots arent logging in in historical numbers. You can quantify that by ratting numbers being at historic lows in bot infested regions.
---
yes, and the change fucks with players and doesn't make alliances blink.

---
Serious here i think all big bloc krabs are crying courently... so i guess and hope they fuck off!
---
Some items i track are up over 100% already with no inventory coming into the market because people are too scared to farm the sites.   Once those modules go up 400% people will farm because of risk/reward
---
Nah, it'll just make everything incredibly risk averse. 100 titans or 0.

Okay, and you never felt that everything you do could be made in twice less time you had another account ? that all the content you do with people would be easier with your own accounts ?
---
Yes, [we are.](https://i.imgur.com/NoeKFsH.jpg)
---
he said carrier ratting
---
not the best form of isk.  if he was asking that i'd say go wormhole.
---
Tech 2 Nidhogger pilot? Where do I get one of those!
---
super umbrella.  a massive fleet of supers and caps that jump to any member who comes under attack.   saving the ship(usually)  and murdering the attackers(or making them run)
---
Are you saying all the whalers, wormholers, and roamers would agree to not destroy them as well as the large blocks?  
---
Or are you saying the structure would have to be balanced between enough EHP to survive a few minutes, and not enough to make it a huge grind to destroy them, and you don't trust CCP to be able to balance that?
---
Its quite lovely tbh
---
More roaming fleets.
---
That's the thing I guess? I dont hear a lot of goon krabs crying. Most if them are just more active in defense fleet, etc. Have scouts and all.
---
Uh this is provi so delonewolf is most likely blue or neutral to them
---
I mean a Nid equiped with tec2 modules ...
---
They buy your plex though, I am not gonna pick up the slack, I have more shit than isk.
---
It's fine with one account, but it's way better to have at least all 3 slots of somewhat trained characters, like main, cap alt and whatnot. I liked single window more too, but sometimes 2 are just so much better and i've personally learned to enjoy it.
---
I do anticipate some things to tank in price with people moving to LS/HS but basically yes.
---
&gt; play eve
---
&gt;Slightly confused if these botters are producing more PLEX to sell on market then surely the supply will only go down thus increasing prices of PLEX once botters are no longer around.
---
Botters buy ingame plex not supply them
---
Jspace explorers unite, until we bump into each other, I will totally shoot at you.
---
Same my dude, dont get on my grid :)
---
I sell tons of ships way above costs.  If you are going to get into the markets, know everything about the items you are dealing in.  Perhaps the building price is high because of some moon goo item or PI mATERIAL.   You can usually make a ton of isk messing with building materials instead of dealing in finished products.   THATS how to make isk.
---
I dont trust people to survive the thousand man titan amd super cap fleet people would drop the second their Intel was threatened. -.-
---
Against ALL Authority. Skip.
---
"Hilariously, they died to an unlikely pairing of allies TEST Alliance and Pandemic Legion (and others, of course, forming the HBC - Honey Badger Coalition) who forced them out and then lived in their space."
---
This is wrong. Propaganda and PL napwagon had very little to do with death of aaa. aAa suffered typical failcascade "when there is nothing to do in the game". Basicly in 2009 ET quit. Then, after few months second person in command quit . And then third person in command said "fuck it, im out too". After that - aAa still existed, but it was just a shadow of it former self. Like PL without Shadoo during 2006-2009 i think.
---
Memes and propaganda had very little to do with collapse of aAa. aAa collapsed just like any other alliance. People who cared enough - quit the game.
---
Less botters you will see less "RMT" looking kills.   Where do you think all that botting isk goes?
---
You should expect a good bit of confusion. Take it slowly, ask people for advice in-game as you go. The community in eve is a great help the majority of the time!
---
I left Delve in a Tengu, bomber and covert ops for a multi-box raiding party through Thera. After poking my head through a few wormholes and finding nobody besides a proper TEST nanogang plodding through Detroid, the desire to continue my hunt slipped away. 
---
The trio exited Thera, with the covops tethering at 0 on a Fortizar and the other two circling the wormhole hoping for some kind of redemption. Voices of my corpmates and friends crackled through comms, discussing the finer points of the blackout, when a Tuskers Loki decloaked on the Fort.
---
I knew his plan. 
---
The Loki began cautiously burning toward the covops, so I warped the tackle and DPS to within 10 and nervously prepared my fingers to spring the trap. At point range, I Q-clicked the covops to permatether and revealed the jaws Mr. Loki had walked into. 
---
Point. Web. Too far for scram. The bomber set to orbit, while my Tengu charged ahead, my fingers cycling F1-F3. 
---
In the confusion that muddies the actions of a novice hunter, I accidentally cloaked my Tengu *twice*, leaving the Loki 40km away and out of range for nearly everything I had equipped. Moments after my bomber died, I warped the Tengu out of harm‚Äôs way.
---
I played 5 year and still have no idea what I'm doing

3 slots ? I heard that you can't train more than one character at a time, why would you train your alts instead of your main character ? So in your opinion 2 accounts is the right balance between efficience and pleasure ?

 C4 WH space is poison to children's minds and it creates a fake world   for them to live in, they think they are safe from HK and LZHWK seeding   250 caps in their azbel, or from the inevitable 60 man TDSIN gila blob   out for their rorqual but they are wrong and delusional, this will   happen. C4 causes radiated autism which created  anime and furries and   this introduces pornographic material at a young age and has very   graphic and violent scenes which rots your children from the inside.   This carries over into adulthood and creates these lazy, nasty, hideous   slobs that were once your children that now sleep with an anime/furfag   body pillow at night and read mangas at least 10 times a day, this was   caused because C4s take a long to time to scan to find content and this   rots the brain, just like spodbrain. C4 scanning also consumes your  soul  and wastes time that could be used to go outside, get 60 minutes  of  fresh air, do homework and contribute something to society. The  people  who live in wolf rayets are not the problem, C4s are the  problem, think  about it, if C4s were deleted, the current C4 corps  would move to the  next cancer, Wolf rayets, and kill the current  degenerates using stabbed  cerberus (after their reload killed like 7  sabres of course)  living  there. C4 WH space is the root of all  problems, cancer, war, Africa,  anime, furries and Nazis. Since people  have to scan sooo much for  content  on the monitor screen for hours, it  uses electricity and is the  reason why the oil reserves will run out  soon. C4 space causes cancer  because it has been proven monitor screens  emit radiation and radiation  causes uncurable spodbrain cancer.  spodbrain has caused war by inspiring  the Nazis to side with the  Japanese through their cartoons and  establishing the Pacific Front in  World War 2. African leaders in Africa  are corrupted by spodbrain  addiction inflicted in C4 wolf rayets as  well anime and furry  influences caused by this and they cannot tend to  their peoples needs  and cannot feed them. Future generations of  wormholers will be ruined  and destroyed by the C4 influence. Everyone  thinks the downfall of  humanity will be ourselves, but in reality it is  spodbrain C4 rorquals .  After the atomic radiation, the Japanese wanted  to get their revenge  on the world and created their ultimate weapon C4  wormholes, which led  to the creation of anime, furries, nazis and  commies.
---
No, not at all. Some specific play styles still exist, but all the people who used to do the amazing blobs videos either left the game or stopped playing because of them.
---
To run DED's?   
---
I dont know as i dont run sites at all.  I know a lot of people use Gilas or drone boats.  Lots of ppl use t3c's to farm drone lands for DDAs and Nexus chips.   I just buy the items that most people are using and raise the price on those.

mikal is [F I N E](https://i.redd.it/8grkzicdhjwz.jpg)
---
I'd argue -A- were still influential without ET.  The best? Nah, but still a force that you had to be aware of.
---
Depends on what you want to do. Solo explorer? One account is fine. Solo blackops? Literally mandatory to have 2 and works best with 3. My advice is figure out what you enjoy doing in the game first. If you find other people who do the same thing get use out of multiple accounts, and you can afford it, sub more. You can always start an alpha clone and get free sp training up to 5 mill while you decide.
---
Thank you, ive been thinking of doing a market podcast weekly to help people out since noone really does one now.
---
Hahahah, wants to carrier rat.
---
Looks like more than a Manticore.
---
At least 2 and a half Manticores.
---
So adjust the idea, make it so that it can't be in the same system as player gate maybe?  Sure you can cyno, once then have a fatigue timer before
---
Or just say no structures and local stays dead.  I guess that works.  I prefer to give player options and choices is all.
---
Double confirming DnG are good people
---
If you give people a choice it will invariably end in political agreements and super cap umbrellas for structures
---
Those ganks were performed in locations lacking a beacon.
---
It is possible to ratt in 0.0 sec.
---
Hey,first of all, good fkin job,golden balls dude. And second:  i have no clue how titans are fitted/work, but why is there 2 props on there ? both MWD. Can someone explain please ? Also, isnt that a weird fit titan ?
---
And you had only 1 out for the whole fleet in a system, not 5 of them in 1 single anom
---
agree.  If/When the blackout ends the markets might tank again.  
---
Null sec was filled with botters and everyone knew that.   Those bots would warp back to a POS as soon as any neutral entered system.  The blackout breaks the bots programming and for the last 4 days almost no bots are out botting in NS.  Bots are sill out in LS/HS systems running missions though.
---
Don't confuse depth and complexity.
---
Deep games are worth learning.
---
I know plenty of good players with one account. It‚Äôs definitely not necessary. 
---
I feel you should play the game for a while to really gauge this kind of stuff though. Eve is a sandbox with a many different play styles, and dependent on what you want to, there will be different answers. 
---
I played for a long time before deciding I wanted an alt, and I didn‚Äôt make the alt account because I felt I had to in order to be competitive, I just wanted to.
---
To be an alpha is free, so your not going to lose anything by playing for a while and figuring it if it‚Äôs for you. If you already played it and enjoyed it, then I see absolutely no reason why you shouldn‚Äôt jump back in!
---
Except he has no idea how to pve in null.
---
Here's the way I see it. I pay for my month, then buy 500 plex. Bout $30 bucks. I play damm near every weekend into the morning hours and a bit through the week. To me that is worth $30 bucks a month. People spend 30 bucks on dumb shit all the time. At least this way I dont have to go outside and waste money on other stuff.
---
oooh I didn't realize that's how they are programmed for null. Good to know ty :)
---
I dont multibox, but I have 3 toons. My main is subcap and dont fly any capitals, so I decided to make a sabre alt/dread to train while im playing on my main. I also wanted a toon to make my isk to fund my pvp activities and made an incursion alt. Its not necessary to have all these, but it helps to have more toons. Train different stuff and such.
---
You can play with one account but I find it's really handy to have two. Your second account can scout for your main, salvage, loot stuff, sit in Jita updating market orders while you do something more fun on your main, transport stuff for you (blockade runner alt is super useful), light cynos etc.
---
That said I played with one account for years, it's perfectly doable especially early in the game. Over time you'll just want the added flexibility that having more than one account brings.
---
Only Bob tells me what to do! Take your upvote and Praise Bob!
---
This is like four days old.
---
The 0.5 systems are already very crowded with orca fleets
---
I'm just not seeing the big deal. I'm in Horde and have to change very little of my gameplay. Oh no, I might get dropped on! Because cynos weren't a thing before?
---
Here's the differences I've noticed: identifying cloaky enemies is a bit harder, but nothing some extra tank and a cyno (or friends in system the cloaker didn't scout properly, or that were docked) can't deal with. The ships I fly tended to be cheap before, they're still cheap now. I sometimes have to spend a bit more time scouting ahead if I'm moving something expensive, no big deal, and something I should have been doing (and often did do) before.
---
Also, moving stuff around in my BR is way easier now. Unless someone is gate camping it's unlikely they'll even know I passed through, and a gate camp is completely unaffected by the blackout (in terms of dealing with it). Abyssals have exactly the same level of risk they had before. And with abyssals being a thing, plus the upcoming VNI nerf and drifters, why even bother ratting? Moon mining is virtually unchanged, and supercap umbrellas are just as effective as they were before.
---
And now hunters have to do more work just to find targets...they can't use local to see what systems they can just pass through and which might have targets, if they want to know they must scan/scout each system they go through. This means effectively I have *more* warning on intel that a roaming gang is on the move.
---
Maybe roamers are having a different experience but so far the big blocks seem to have already adapted. In fact, they're taking advantage of defensive intel to intercept and bait small gangs. The whole "no local" thing works both ways, and a roaming group has no idea if what they see on dscan is all that's in the system.
---
A lot of people are saying "adapt!!!" to the big blocks, but as far as I can tell the big block response has mostly been a giant yawn with operations continuing as normal. Drifters were *far* more disruptive than the blackout.
---
Congratulations, you have triggered a special prize! PM me your character name and I'll send over 500 PLEX.

=)
---
Not everyone enjoys the same things.  I don‚Äôt mind pvp and enjoy it, but i prefer mining and ratting and ded sites.  I enjoy industry and ‚Äúbuilding bet worth‚Äù
---
But at the same time i‚Äôll be the first to throw everything i have at anyone attacking me
---
? Pvp is fun as hell, going through the boring pve is the only way for me to pay for it. Thought this was the general setup for people.

When you manage to bait both goons and people who hate goons with the same thread title.

&gt; Wreck his face with kin/exp, it's not hard
---
&gt; I once engaged 15 Chinese in kitey cruisers with a single jag, I was flying dual nano rlml orthrus with just scram+point. Got their jag to hull before he had to break off with no tackle besides my scram in under 20s. A 4-5 man gang would have splatted him easy while his friends were still 70+ km behind, approaching at 2-3k/s.
---
thats a lot to unpack here.
---
1: you were probably in the best ship to do that in a solo manner, a cruiser with scram+point bonus and bonused for rlml.
---
2: a **scrammed** a dual masb ramjag before adc can effectively tank your orthrus dps in its lowest resist hole with a single overheated masb.
---
3: a heated ramjag goes up to ~6km/s before links/drugs/implants, if you were in any other ship -and honestly even in the orthrus cause latency, you didnt overheat it or didng bling- he should be able to drift your scram and turn your prop off and reset a cceleration for a couple ticks.
---
4: if the only thing within 70km of your fastest tackle is the jag you effectively gave up the grid already, what even is the point, why would anyone burn in that much into an orthrus when they can just bounce and get a warpin. Sure some people may do it but its because they're dumbo
---
5: you had him on hull because you're flying a ship with a pretty big alpha, or you just think you were flying against a ramjag and wasn't. I really shouldn't be a huge surprise that eventually a cruiser made for shredding small shit will be able to kill a lone frigate, that's hardly the issue.
---
6: unironic just bring a 4-5 man gang to deal with a single &lt;50m assault frigate
---
&gt; Edit: also adcu is not invincibility by any means, it brings his ehp to 40k max for 15s, instead of the normal 10k, and usually they pop it in hull which means they only have about 10k or so left and at least one shield booster out of charges.
---
those numbers are straight up wrong mate
---
Could you point me to where it does? I went back and looked at every announcement and the forum post and ctrl-Fed "temp" to see where it said that instead of "undetermined duration," and found nothing. :)
---
Often in EVE speculators have stockpiles and when a price jumps you will actually see an overcorrection for a few days and sometimes pricing will drop below where it was.    
---
I am one of those people that will tank a hot market when it becomes saturated and then buy everyones stuff real cheap and reset.   Overcorrection is HUGE in EVE markets.
---
It's complex for everybody.
---
Not just new players.
---
Ferengi rules of aquisition 13:   Anything worth doing is worth doing for money.
---
I don't think trit rose 50% because of blackout. The latest rorq nerf is more likely to blame. If the blackout HAS affected ore prices, its purely speculation at this point.
---
Part of what I do for my corporation is put up reshipping contracts in our staging. This is fun for me, and the FCs and pvpers seem to like it, so they can spend more time shooting rather than hauling/industry. Often, newbros don‚Äôt know about contracts, don‚Äôt know how to fit ships, or occasionally lack the skill points to sit in our various doctrine fits, so I (and others) help them out.
---
One fine recent evening, a new recruit (a few days in Eve Online) found the contracts, but lamented that their skills prevented them from using anything at all. Some vets were just finishing up a d-scan class for new people, so I stepped up to help. I managed to meta down a tackle condor without totally gimping the thing, and then gifted it to the recruit. Newbro was so happy, it was like I gave them a 20 billion isk super and a cap umbrella, rather than a walking target worth a can full of carbon.
---
Less than five minutes later, guys showed up in system looking to cause content: three BB, two T2 logi cruisers (grrr blackout, but thank you well-timed d-scan class practical exercise!!). They chased around some of our people, but we managed to dock up. This happens often, and we started the usual hand wringing about a response fleet, having no caps to blob them out of their parents‚Äô apartments with. But then something unusual happened: the 3xBB started shooting at one of our beloved structures! Being a small to mid-sized group of inoffensive members, bash attempts are very rare. We lit the bat signal, which is alliance-only for us. Brave, angry people started popping in from all around the galaxy, yelling about doctrine and asking about shield %. Suddenly, out of the deep emptiness, a quiet, menacingly calm voice intoned on comms, ‚Äúwho is the QRF fleet commander?‚Äù Our wormhole people had arrived without warning, seemingly from nowhere at all, striking terror into the hearts of our allies, though our foes had no inkling (thank you blackout!).
---
FC chosen, madcap composition settled, group undocks. For five enemies, we had three tackle, including the newbro, one or two T1 logi, a bunch of T1 cruisers, a bunch of cancer ewar (including me, industry toon with no combat skills), and of course a guy manning the station.
---
On-grid, the fight is pretty even, then ewar starts to take a toll and we are doing ok. A bunch of T3 cruisers decloak (F\* YOU VERY MUCH, blackout!!), along with some other subcaps, and it‚Äôs GD mayhem. I notice the newbro is tailing me, and figure there was no newbro speech, he/she doesn‚Äôt know anyone, no pvp experience, FC has no time to order a lone frigate to do anything‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm the one familiar name. I fly in close enough for their disruptor to be usable, more than a hair closer than I wanted my ewar to be. Transversal help me now!! Newbro tells me, ‚Äúwoah! They‚Äôre shooting at me!‚Äù I‚Äôm betting the newbro didn‚Äôt have tactical overview, was probably zoomed in, and saw the bullets flying past were roughly the same size as the ship he/she was flying. I said, ‚Äúthey‚Äôd be fools not to. You‚Äôre the reason they can‚Äôt run away now that we‚Äôre winning.‚Äù ‚ÄúOmg‚Äù the newbro says. I respond with: ‚ÄúBroadcast for reps.‚Äù Yeah, but what did the newbro know? Good habits, is all I‚Äôm saying.
---
After 20 minutes ‚Äúkicking and a‚Äôgouging in the mud and the blood and the beer‚Äù, we forced them off without reinforcing our structure, and the newbro lived to get on a few super sweet T2 logi cruiser killmails. After receiving their professions of undying, loving friendship, the bat-men and ‚Äìwomen from around the galaxy returned to their homes. The wormholers accepted our nervously-offered gratitude with quiet menace, and vanished from dscan, possibly from known space, I have no idea (cuz blackout). A touch breathless, the newbro said on comms that the past half hour were the most fun they had ever had playing a video game in their whole life.
---
&lt;Disclaimer: I changed one thing to make the story more fun. The tale is, however, almost entirely true.&gt;
---
I should buy bitcoin
---
No he conveniently left out the part where rorqs and carriers/supers got buffed to ungodly degrees before being dialled back, presumably because he's an average imperium line krab acting completely in bad faith or someone who only joined after skill injectors became a thing. A carrier or rorq today is still infinitely stronger than a carrier or rorq was pre-2015.
---
That idiot died to stupidity, the blackout had no real effect.  He would have died either way for gating around in a ratting super.
---
Like highsec?
---
Don‚Äôt you hate when you give a good answer trying to help out and the guy asking doesn‚Äôt even thank you. I‚Äôll thank you for him guy. A+
---
That right there should be an in-game achievement "made someone complain about you on reddit "
---
To be fair, people who can coordinate 1-man 30-account blops fleets by themselves without any input broadcasting are probably better at the game than the average EVE player.
---
But they earned their skill. You don't just become good at the game because you are able to multibox, multiboxing more than 2-3 accounts takes real skill and practice, and leaves you vulnerable in the event things don't go right. It's hard to extract 30 accounts from a counterdrop, after all.
---
&gt; I‚Äôm just telling you that fewer subscribers, whether they‚Äôre subscribed by PLEXing or by purchasing game time directly, means less revenue for CCP.
---
Incorrect.  If I do not sub 4 Rorqs because I don't want to multibox them during Blackout, CCP has not lost a single dime.  Those PLEX will just go to someone else, and the price will change SLIGHTLY.  You are wrong because you think a small change in Isk received for PLEXing is going to make a massive difference, yet you ignore how ALL other prices will change as well.  Isk is probably going to be worth more relative to modules and ships.
---
CCP is not losing revenue unless people buy less PLEX directly from CCP.  Period.  Fewer subscribed characters doesn't actually mean anything.  Fewer subscribed people won't either UNLESS they actually bought PLEX directly from CCP.  Those people are cancelled out by the people that come back to Eve because it's actually fun again anyways.
---
agreed.  And yes i did overgeneralize when i said PVP'ers dont PVE.
---
The Jita gals live by this rule.
---
to much to read here
---
You can inject skills and buy multiple characters traning thing so it's easy to get just the right things.
---
I think 2 account is the way as you become way more efficient in multiple ways with almost the same effort.
---
Not to mention the monstrosity that is the FAX post cap-rebalance.
---
The wrecking ball was ridiculous, but with titan DDs the way they are, it probably wouldve balanced them out.
---
r/woosh
---
Shhh, you're ruining their narrative
---
If you want to be in a smaller alliance, forget it. Smaller alliances relied on strong intel to avoid getting caught, rather than a massive capital umbrella to drop on everything. With the local blackout, CCP basically told smaller alliances to get fucked.
---
What you should expect is as follows:
---
\- Start the game, follow the tutorial.
---
\- Realize the entire game is point and click.
---
\- Get through some initial confusion with navigating the overview. If you're a decent gamer or work in IT this won't be much of an issue. If not, it's gonna take some time.
---
\- Likely you will get stuck on a mission loop thereafter as it will initially be the only way you know how to make ISK - the ingame currency.
---
\- Then get into mining as it seems like a nice ISK boost, but quickly start questioning your sanity.
---
\- Then start noticing a little email spam ingame from corps wanting your fresh blood to join for whatever reason, probably to benefit them more than you but not always.
---
\-  Join a corp that sounds cool, but then have no idea what to do. Continue flying solo.
---
\- Decide playing another more rewarding game is probably a better choice.
---
\- Keep coming back to Eve Online for God only knows why.
---
Sorry mate, that's PGL
---
Its because i wanted to shine a positive light on some of the negativity.  I wanted to show the casual NS PVE player that this could lead to greater income overall in a shorter period of time.  Show them that it might become easier to plex an account with less grinding.  Yes risk is going up, but with that so should the rewards.
---
I‚Äôve been playing 6 years straight, don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve done a single thing you‚Äôve listed
---
You can totally go it alone with one character or playing with others.
---
Multiboxing just does reduce your reliance on other people.
---
So you can be more efficient in many cases multiboxing, but not necessarily a whole lot. The cognitive overload of multiboxing is actually really hard to deal with in a lot of situations.
---
But many things like exploration don't benefit from multiboxing anyway.
---
The sub rate can't be measured well short term, because a lot of people sub for more than a month at a time.  Therefore, anyone quitting because of this change potentially wouldn't be counted for months that they have left.
---
Great feedback right there.  I really enjoyed your use of facts and game mechanics to justify your position.  Well done
---
I see you point, and I'm not disagreeing, or not entirely disagreeing.
---
I think it will drive down mining in the short term, and drive up prices, it's pretty much a given.
---
In the long term I can see mining 'bouncing back' as the risk vs reward math changes and ore prices go up.  To the point where claim jump / sneaky mining in something cheap or cloaky may be worth while.
---
Purely speculation on my part, but time will tell.  I'm betting on greed/fast isk as a motivator though.
---
Well that would be the argument that can 2 players work together to do more than 1 person.
---
Which is always going to be true.
---
But that doesn't mean you can't go it alone.
---
Glad vily is following noraus's lead with pings ;)
---
Sure, but you said it's a big thing, so i wonder how's so?
---
If they were, that‚Äôd be... impressively pathetic
---
there are tokens you can get to train multiple characters on the same account at once but even without those it is a good idea to train up the other characters a bit because you will use them for different tasks. 
---
the main reason to have a second account IMO is to be able to have eyes in 2 places at once. Having an interceptor alt helps you avoid warping your main into trouble
---
They got us in the first half, not gonna lie
---
They have already told me they unsubbed and complained in the box of why they are leaving to ccp 8 times today. Then I linked the screenshot of grath saying he supports deleting warp core stabs but to expect donkey like braying to ensue and they lost their fucking minds.
---
The game takes like 3 minutes to download though?
---
Like it just downloads as you play dynamically...
---
First few hours? Making your character then doing a tutorial where you get to save the world.
---
Ten you get thrown into the real world and you'll be confused and die a lot.
---
Accurate.
---
Tbh mate we are all speculating.  We be paid shit loads of money if we could tell the future.  It's certainly going to be intersting for a while
---
It's not that terrible.
---
You just have to actually pay attention and do what it tells you.
---
*unironic* wormholer btw
---
I hear there are a bunch of risk adverse small gang pvpers that are crying about big blocks still being able to counter drop just as well as before the black out?
---
 Can anyone c/d there is salt mine that hasn't been tapped yet?
---
Do I get a special flair? Time to triple my shitposting output
---
&gt;If it breaks, well tbh I didn't test shit
---
CCP should hire you.
---
Yes, you are right. It is dangerous to be in 0.0 sec.
---
BUT REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
I saw the price of a cinema ticket the other day (I haven't purchased cinema tickets for over 2 years, ok?)
---
I could literally play eve for 2 months, or see a 2hr long film. Not hard to figure which is better value for money.

Ever killed a Botting VNI?  Those modules are worthless anyhow.  They dont fit anything expensive or rare. 
---
Regarding modules, i am talking Deadspace (the blue ones) and those only drop from running sites.  You cannot manufacture those with BPO's.     
---
Regarding returning players,  those people will buy plex with IRL and sell to the market to fund their gameplay thus adding more plex into the economy.
---
Agreed. They'd be just one more hurdle for alliances that want to move to null.
---
Okay, I mean even in exploration, you could use a scout for safety when you explore in wormholes
---
Blockade runners also have much more cap than Leopard or Pacifier. So they can do longer warps without stopping. Not sure if this would be enough to make them faster for really long distances.
---
Also if they are warping on a straight line the align time becomes less important since they come out of warp with some starting speed in the right direction.
---
DnG are (probably sort of a few brain cells) people
---
filing this one for when observatories come out.  Cause its the reverse river of tears is going to be epic.
---
Think of it this way. There is absolutely zero point to training your main to fly a capital ship if you don't have your own alt account to light a cyno for you
---
I went: 
---
6 months w/ only 1 account
---
1 more month till I got a 3rd scout
---
6 more months till I started my supercap account
---
...etc.
---
Today: I have 6 accounts. All with 3 characters (every 2nd/3rd character slot is simply a reaction farming toon). Yeah it's overkill. But i couldn't operate with less than 3 accounts. My main, my cyno/scout, and my titan. 
---
Also if you ever want to blops fc without looking like a fool, you need 3 toons minimum.
---
Miss you guys,  Since i dont do market updates on slack anymore i thought i would take it to reddit.   
---
Hey tell the guys to sell all those stats i told them to buy for 150m a few months back.. Its time !
---
Welcome to fun. Being a newbro can be a bit boring at first, learning how to fly your ship and use the overview. Unfuck your overview - Z-S Overview is your friend.
---
Make friends. Poke some corporation recruiting channels and see if you get to talk to anyone you like. Don't think you have to join a big nullsec corp to have fun. There's more gameplay in Eve than the big empires.
---
Go out and lose some ships and then go lose more ships and maybe kill something.
---
It's P2W imho and makes it infinitely harder to find 1v1s.
---
Agreed. It's why I quit, too. 1 person should be playing 1 character.
---
same me with POE
---
&gt; Blackout already made a lot of krabs dock up
---
It hasn't even been a week yet, I don't take anything that people are doing right now as a serious indicator of how the meta will adapt. Krabs are still in the middle of their tantrum, give them a week or two to cry themselves out and then see what happens. 
---
There's one thing you can always rely on in Eve -- krabs gonna krab.
---
Ah this makes way more sense. Seems the easy solution is to disable stabs within 200km of beacons.
---
Then you didn't pay attention to the thread on the Eve-O board last week announcing the change. Nine out of ten of the first thousand or so posts raging that they and their wives were unsubbing their 17+ accounts over the blackout pulled up as Goons on evewho.
---
Was legit funny af to watch.
---
Teach me
---
Actualy there is a "Elinor reloaded"  [http://elinor.slivo.fr/downloads/](http://elinor.slivo.fr/downloads/)
---
Go back to highsec, you can care eat there
---
Sadly this... People are going for the new players because they‚Äôre the easy targets and with this there‚Äôs no combat
---
There are 1000s of items you can trade, and looking for onse that would be profitable to be worth the work will require legwork. There are tools and sites like Evemarketer that you can use to look for potential items. That will get you started.
---
If you want to get REALLY serious, learn to program and how to use ESI to grab market statistics. You can then automate a lot of the analysis. I'm currently working on something to do just that.
---
Also, remember that profit margin isn't the only thing to consider. You need to look at trade volume. If you try to trade something with a high margin but it takes weeks to sell, it might not be worth it. 
---
Pm me your character name and I'll send some isk your way to help get you started.
---
Adapt
---
Pay to win what? Isk? If your only goal in Eve and your classification of ‚Äúbeing good‚Äù is your wallet size, maybe that‚Äôs the real problem. 
---
The people with 60000 alts aren‚Äôt the ones who would 1v1 you anyways. Go get into FW and you‚Äôll get more fights like that, and guess what? No alts needed, you can even do it alpha and be half good at it.
---
This is normal CCReee.  They are well known to manipulate metrics to push an agenda, so they can say "see, we were right!".
---
Paging CCP 360mTicks
---
&gt; rage comics are even more cringe than boomer Facebook posts
---
You say that like it's a bad thing.
---
Yes , but these aren't whales. Whales refer to people spending large amounts of cash to buy PLEX. The people you described PLEX there accounts by earning ISK though their turbo crabbing, not through their credit card.
---
Thanks for your comment, I actually don't want to play so hardcore, I'll maybe try a moment with my account and an alpha, juste to see if I can handle two windows and if I like it.
---
I'm not that interested in capital ships, it seems to be too much pressure, I like the idea of roaming in the space doing what I want in the moment, so I guess that's not my playstyle
---
nope, most botters are just farming 'ticks' that i guess just goes into buying plex/injecectrrs for RMT.    
---
I have been about 75% buy orders over the past two weeks anticipating this.   PVP fuels the markets and lots of speculators are sitting on stacks ready to sell.  I foresee an over correction for a few weeks on some items as greedy market people all will try and dump together.
---
I'd rather see this game burn then degrade further into a carebear paradise.
---
The article is very well written.
---
Same here. My wife was like "I got us (2 kids) 4 movie tickets, it was $48. I'm like "WTF!"
---
Nah, I‚Äôll just unsub.  Highsec money is crap.
---
Well there are a shit ton of people who feel the same as me, so you can have your opinion and I will have the fact that CCP won't have my money and we will see how this plays out.
---
Soooo multiple people shouting while ogling the hot female avatars?
---
My market alt keeps about 1T in liquid isk.  My investments are crazy though as i have stacks of all sorts of weird shit i am sitting on.
---
Cause it‚Äôs still one of the bigger ways to get isk
---
Then, stop complaining. Nullsec isn‚Äôt for you if you gotta post retarded shit like this... with a throwaway account
---
We were discussing those in comms last night and most of my guys seem to be okay with the idea. It'd be better if they don't get introduced, but if they do there are ways they can be used against the owners.
---
Scroll through reddit for about 3 min and 12 seconds. Now you know.
---
Rad - it seems that small gangs are way more prevalent. It also seems that more people are doing things together, its not safe to be alone anymore
---
As long as you get your ship fittings from zkill XD
---
No for real: fitting can be complex. and the right use of a ship or a special fitting in pvp can be complex. but the PvE part is rly easy to learn. The most "secrets" from the past are covered in one of the 5000 guides to each activity
---
thats awesome !  Always happy to see returning players.
---
&gt; Can you explain how one-sided ganking is a good fight and not a curbstomp? 
---
That's my point. Now I'm not saying there shouldn't be one-sided ganks, I'm just saying that the cap umbrella is overkill. Any umbrella is overkill. You can just teleport giant fleets without any drawbacks? That's not okay. It makes space far too easy to defend.
---
&gt; You only see. . .well-run umbrella
---
Okay, it takes work. That doesn't make it a good thing.
---
&gt;You get caps. . .defending space
---
*Side note: just to be clear, I'm mostly an outsider looking in here. I don't really hunt people nor do I get caps dropped on me. I mostly explore.*
---
Ganking people who don't want to pvp should be a thing. As an explorer, the game would be dreadfully boring if I didn't have to watch out for ganks. It would just be scanning and hacking simulator with zero danger. The game is supposed to be dangerous, right?
---
&gt;roaming in areas that are off-limits
---
That shouldn't be a thing. What happens when off-limits roaming areas encompass the entire map?
---
You can't actually walk around in Elite now can you? Just land on the planet and use your buggy?
---
I think the best summary I can think of is this:  
---
If you're just starting out, keep your single account and have as much fun as possible. You will know when, if ever, you need a second account since it's really only for a couple of mostly niche activities.
---
thanks Luigi.   I invested heavy in Recons, Strats, T3Cs and subsystems before the blackout.  Lets just say it worked out well.
---
or buy low and burn it out of the economy by spending it sevices and silly stuff, and let the price stay high.
---
It's not that complex. This is a team game though, get some friends and burn something down.
---
Are you mining in asteroid fields or moon mining?
---
You don't need many accounts until the high end game, and that's a point when you can afford many accounts anyway.
---
 [u/uwutranslator](https://www.reddit.com/u/uwutranslator/)
---
Actually i made this post to show people how they will make more isk in less time because of the blackout.  In my market posts i rarely ever will say "Buy this or sell this".  Its usually more of observations and speculations.
---
You. I like you. Keep up the good work.
---
I was in a carebear alliance once, at some point I realized that I disagreed with almost everyone else in comms all the time. Was time to go.
---
The complexity of eve comes from to main things
---
One
---
THE GODDAM NUMBERS
---
Two
---
The sandbox
---
In eve there are a few concepts you need to understand first 
---
1every ship has a certain purpose 
---
2every ship WILL be lost 
---
3every ship is expandable 
---
4always use the right tool for the job, if that's impossible try getting as close as possible 
---
5dont fly what you cannot replace 
---
Then you can try to understand what can you do in eve Google wtd eve you should find that great chart. 
---
Then after choosing an activity look it up on YouTube Google some tutorials and ask in game for help. 
---
Join a group, a Corp they will help you a lot if you ask 
---
The one who asks knows More 
---
Then after making money use the fit simulation thing get to know modules and try other activities maybe something will interests you? 
---
After you made some money tried some gameplays, join a Corp that does what you like doing. 
---
Congrats now you could say you play eve
---
I am thinking of starting a podcast/twitch show to talk market things.  I miss listening to the guy that used to do it years ago.
---
Dont undock.
---
maybe and kind of, I think the answer to your question is how does new plex enter the economy.
---
it's indirectly commodity backed due to cash for Plex.  So plex is hypothetically infinite, but the money needed to move new plex into the game isn't.
---
TFW oogling Manface Missiletits
---
funny thing, i dont invest in plex at all anymore.  I used to when it was single plex.   Tons of people stress monthly to have enough isk to sub accounts and hopefully the price comes down so more people are in space with extra income to lose.
---
Meh :/, not a huge fan of it.  can i live with it? yes, but i find it an annoyance.  will see how it impacts overall balance.
---
Would be fun to see some more EVE Economy sort of Twitch Streams or the likes.  I'll PM you, I'm new to it, but I've been thinking on things I could do with Twitch as I do stream a small bit.
---
hey guys, does anyone else like anime?
---
Thank you.
---
nullsec is scary now
---
if you go there you'll have the most intense, exciting gaming experience you've ever had
---
then you'll learn that there are people who voluntarily live in wormhole space which is even more terrifying and intense 
---
hope that's what you want
---
Bro you got to chill. This is a sandbox not everyone has to play the game as you will. Been on eve since 2006 and people like you make me laugh.
---
I was this beam slicer in the video, not exactly that fit but the concept is to wait at 12km and command orbit at this range with beams and webs overheated
---
Local chat was a common ground in all of eve except for wormholes. From highsec(safe place), lowsec (semi safe/dangerous), and nullsec (safe/dangerous) local chat was apart of the game. Local was used for random things by simple messaging or to tell who was all in the system with you. It was a simple to check if the system you were in was hostile or friendly depending on what alliance you‚Äôre in.
---
Nullsec after the recent changes made it so local chat now is delayed; meaning you can‚Äôt immediately see who is in local with you unless you type something and enter the chat. Without local chat immediately displaying who is in system with you, it‚Äôs a gamble if you‚Äôre alone or not. This now renders much more risk involved if you choose to do anything in nullsec.
---
I probably started about 6 years ago but I always end up ship spinning and quitting. Have also deleted maybe 2 or 3 characters for reasons unknown. I don't know why I keep coming back lol. But I strongly suspect many new players go through a similar experience and just quit a lot sooner than me.
---
I am not afraid to make posts that'll downvoted to hell. I do not post ez upvotes like game news etc. I am hated and tribal downvoted by the spodbrain half of the nullsec. Of course I'm not in there.
---
Now if we had a "most controversial posters of r/Eve then we'd seel".
---
Yup, but that may be less efficient than just going blind.
---
I don't think it will prevent enough losses to ever justify the costs.
---
trit went up initially because goons went to war. Nothing to do with rorq nerfs.  
---
I bought 50bil in trit for $4.50 when mittens announced he was invading the north.  Recently sold it for $6.50 making myself a really good profit
---
I used to do a lot of missions in a busy system, never happened to me, plus, if your doing it right you are after that LP.
---
Not gping to blame anyone but since goons have most ppayers in game ofc the majority of the percentage will be goons too. Ofc all big blocs have those. I think eve will be a better place for all without them
---
Except it's not and never was.
---
I have 3 accounts, 5 toons in total. 1 main that is subbed doing Planetary Interaction (Pi) flying the Gallente Tier 3 Cruiser the Proteus. Im training it to fly the Minmatar T3 Cruiser as well so I can have 2 pretty decent ships to fly. My 2nd account is doing Pi on 3 toons and is using PLEX to play as omega, the 3 toons dont fly anything besides a T1 Transport ship for Pi materials. My 3rd account is going to be my Caldari/Amarr T3 pilot and probably Battlecruiser pilot, but it's not even subbed since im just passively training it right now.
---
I agree most of the stuff you say, but the last part get me puzzled for a bit. 
---
EVE is already hard, especially with respect to the combat system that is somewhat clunky and have a very high skill ceiling. New players already feel overwhelmed while in an Ewar frig or things like that, and if fleet battles revolves around small gang, high skill (in terms of skillpoints and player skill) and expensive fits, wouldn't that insulate new players further from PvP action?
---
If that happens there must be a revision on the combat system to make it more intuitive, responsive and a well planned tutorial system to accompany it.
---
Krabs being krabs nothing new here
---
Plex is stabilizing at between 3.8 and 3.9 mil. It‚Äôs down, but I don‚Äôt expect it to fall much further barring manipulation
---
Based on what do you assume these positions are for EvE?
---
What Could Possibly Go Wr0ng. 
---
We're still training Eve Vegas Swag to level six!
---
Agree with BadRandolf here, I've played off and on with a single account and have had alot of fun with just the 3 toons on one account. However having the ability to have a second account opens doors within the game. I run 2 accounts at present, but from time to time I let the second account lapse due to RL economic issues, I'm from a Country where the month Sub Cost is high.
---
Any celestial would be an interesting idea.
---
Navigation safeties and such.
---
Blops should remain the same though.
---
The key thing to remember is - "All in good time." You don't have to have two characters *now*, but most people end up with a more than one account, yes. Flying caps without a cyno alt is gonna be hard. Want to fly a Super? You'll need a FAX alt. Same with a Titan - Hel, you might even want *two* fax alts.
---
You can buy a fax alt on the bazaar from 20-30b isk. You can buy a super pilot for the same. Save, save, save and you will get there. Just don't expect it to be *this year* unless you pull out that credit card and get to injecting.
---
I understand your perspective and appreciate the polite tone of your post (honestly I quite tired of trolling on this subreddit, specially on this topic) but I disagree, mostly on the necessity of adapt.
---
What happened to you, and forced you to adapt, is a mix of consequences, partially player driven consequences, partially CCP huge mistakes.
---
Eve is a player driven sandbox with some basic axioms, rules of engagements are some of those few axioms, and rules of engagement determine the differences between hisec, lowsec, nullsec and WH space.
---
Those axioms can't be changed imho, those are the foundations of this game, and without them the game is not Eve anymore.
---
So every player driven action is legit and good for the health of the game, but CCP errors are not, and the biggest mistake CCP made was injectors which are the primary cause of the problem we see today (capital, super, citadel and bot proliferation and their consequences, mainly inflation and rmt). 
---
What is happening now with this mindless move from CCP (even if it's temporary) is a CCP driven change of these axioms, without any serious though about its consequences. 
---
This is a change of the pillars of the game, it's an earthquake, not a simple "shake", and it's destroying the reasons at the base of many players decision to play eve, not safety but collaboration needed to do everything this game has to offer. 
---
I am one of those players. 
---
I never moved from lowsec to null for safety, I started playing in null from the 1st day after the initial training missions long before injectors, citadels and capital proliferation we can see today.
---
Why?
---
Because I love these rules of engagement, otherwise I probability have moved to WH or lowsec long ago.
---
I love sov driven game, I love big groups, big fleets, I hate solo pvp and small roaming pvp.
---
Local chat is part of these rules and made possible to large groups of people to interact and create those empires that made possible for Eve to survive until now, without them, their wars, their greatness Eve probably will be unknown to the public and would never been attractive to so many people, so it will be dead long ago.
---
Null sov and null empires where the same since the beginning of the game, they are not invincible (there are many example of their fragility in the history of Eve) and they survive only thanks to effort of everyone (in other terms I will say because player driven actions), not because of some black magic.
---
That's why I totally agree with those who complain about this blackout, if it will become permanent Eve will not be the same, it will lose any interest for me and probably I will move all my assets to hisec and will not renew the subscription.
---
One last note (I know this is already TLDR), most of the people in real null alliances (not renting ones) don't have lot of accounts, most of them have maximum 2 accounts, only a very small part have more than 3 accounts. Just for info for those who are trolling about bots and extreme multibox krabbers...
---
how you going to promise good tunes then play something from the early-mid 70's
---
Not saying it's not good, but it's kinda old hat.
---
You the dude who bought somewhere around 80k small ancillary armor reps the other day?
---
Depends on the location, but generally 1-2 dozen.
---
Nice i get my money on the 18th XD well done CCP XD
---
There are many aspects of gameplay that you can only participate in if you have alts. "But you can still go play in the kiddy pool" is not a valid response lol
---
So what you're saying is that russian botters are the most skilled EVE players and they earned that skill?
---
What's to stop Goonswarm_1 through Goonswarm_20 from just owning all their current space, with capitals placed as appropriate?
---
Give me an activity that you REQUIRE omega alts for that you couldn‚Äôt do with either an alpha alt or a Corp member.
---
Yet people still kept asking me - the guy who doesn't do this at all - for it. In fucking July.
---
Damn that's a big umbrella
---
Thank you for the answer o/
---
I have done it all. One account for years, two accounts for a year, then from 5 up to 8 accounts over a many years, now back down to 1.
---
You do not NEED to have multiple accounts or characters to have fun and be effective in Eve. And there are definitely situations where playing more than one account can be detrimental. Even an APM God is still more likely to make a mistake when trying to manage 2+ accounts instead of 1, and many times 1 account fully utilized is more useful in a fight than multiple accounts played at 75%: tackle, key scouts, FCs, logi FCs, these folks can't make mistakes because they're distracted by multiboxing. Multiple accounts are expensive. Many players just have more fun with "this is MY character" than "these are my alts." One account can run higher settings on your PC than 5. Etc.
---
All that said, having multiple characters on one account can be very convenient. Market alt, neutral hauler alt, pre-positioned cyno alt, PI and research and manufacture alts, etc. These things can be useful without even having extra accounts, and you can train these alts with generally-cheap MTCs or even just swapping your active queue around.
---
Actual multiboxing is another thing entirely, and yes, it can be hugely powerful. You don't have to have one character do it all anymore. Now you have your small gang guy, a dread alt, a fax alt, and a titan pilot on 4 separate accounts, each training all the time, and 8 more slots for cyno alts, a PI empire, suicide ganker, wormhole seeders, spies, etc. You are more versatile and more powerful in what you can do. Some groups require multiboxing, some activities aren't viable to do by yourself without boxing, etc.
---
It's useful, it can open up new gameplay options, it can make you stronger in some gameplay. But sometimes one account is a better choice, and multiboxing has extra expenses and a different playstyle that isn't for everyone.
---
compare it to the normal ways people make isk.  and i mean average people.
---
VNI ratting, mining, lv 4 missions. etc.
---
vs that, carrier ratting is alot better.  rivaling highsec incursions.
---
so while not one of the best ways, its one of the better than average
---
Join a new player group and let them help you. My recommendation is Pandemic Horde. 
---
EvE is much easier with friends to help you.
---
You're not the hero we deserve, just the one we have &lt;3
---
Yeah. That's probably the best moments you'll ever have in this game.
---
That's not to say the game is bad, it really isn't. But that feeling of awe and wonder as you enter into the game for the first time is something you'll sadly never get again.
---
Don't bother they don't involve new guys (blackout) unless you live in null then ur Corp will tell you the trig invasion is a pve event so you could. Try to join some fleets and ask for a praxis explain that you are new you could find a Corp a few friends and a new ship that way
---
If you haven't started interacting with Nullsec (any of the regions of space containing systems whose Security Status is &lt;=0.0), the last two weeks of changes and drama do not affect you at all.
---
However, because there are a lot of people who do live out in Null, there is a lot of noise being made on Reddit related to them.
---
As for an actual explanation, there are two separate things going on
---
1. Drifter Invasion. So players can build their own starbases ('Upwell Structures' / 'Citadels'; there's like a dozen different types for different purposes). A few weeks ago, a specific type of NPC, the Drifters, which have been in the game for years, suddenly got a lot more common and a lot more aggressive, with groups of them spawning and marauding across systems and very deliberately attacking player owned structures. This caused a lot of noise as the major player alliances were forced to think about defensive logistics to get the drifters to stop breaking their toys. A week after the initial assault, the assault redoubled but also included the Drifters warping to the green Combat and Mining Anomalies that people used for PvE content, and attacking players who were doing that. This caused a second wave of drama.
---
2. Nullsec Blackout. So EVE has a thing called Local Chat. It's the standard 'oh this is a multiplayer game it should have text chat' thing. It's always active. However, one of its features is that it lists all players who are currently present in the system. Players have used this for a long time as a scouting tool, to check "how many people are in Local?" or "is there an unknown/neutral/hostile player who just entered Local?". Now, there is another region of space known as J-Space or Wormhole Space. Players who live there are often called Wormholers. JSpace doesn't appear on the in-game map. It can only be reached by traveling through 'Unstable Wormhole' Cosmic Signatures. The reason I bring this up is that Local in JSpace doesn't work the same way as it does in the rest of the game (or 'KSpace' as we call it, Wormholer^(btw)). JSpace Local works on an 'opt-in'/'delayed' system, in which entering a system does *not* put you in the Local chat player list; you only appear in Local if you type a message into chat, and doing so only makes you appear in local for a few minutes, and doesn't tell anyone about your entering or leaving the system. The Nullsec Blackout is the change whereby this 'opt-in' Local chat has also spread to all of Nullsec. This is allegedly temporary but we don't know how long it will last. This all caused the third and most current wave of drama.
---
* (In addition, for the last few days, the player-run websites Dotlan and ZKillboard self-imposed their own blackouts to go with the theme of cutting off scouting information, with Dotlan not reporting all the statistics is usually does, and ZKill straight up going offline for 3 days, displaying only a black page with the black text "Hello Darkness my old friend".)
---
You're the #8 submitter and #5 commenter when the numbers are run year to date, FYI.
---
That's something that has historically been difficult for the person you're responding to.
---
&gt;**free SP for NPC kills starting tomorrow**
---
Nope. That starts next week.
---
Nullsec was fun now its empty and boring. Go to lowsec and at least you can tell its empty as you go through it :)
---
The null is more dangerous with the blackout than wh now...
---
Understand that EvE by yourself can be very hard and very boring for a new player.
---
My strong recommendation is to run through the new player tutorials to learn the controls. At that point I would joint a new player friendly group and let them help you jump into the game.
---
Pandemic Horde is the one I would go with. Look them up in game and via google. They will help get you started.
---
Hello, I along with several others, have been in the npc starter corp for years.  We stay in to help new players and help guide them to new and better places.
---
I understand this is a troll, but do realize some of us stay in to actually help people who are very, very lost, such as linking them proper language channels for non english speakers. Shoutout to /u/chribba for creating that list years ago.
---
80k wow.  Perhaps it was someone stocking NS markets since those BPCs only drop from running Data sites. 
---
I used to deal in ancil's when the price was over 1m.  Haven't dealt in them since the drop rates of their BPC's changed a couple years back
---
It's like comparing militia to operators. Weekend warriors 'pvp' on a QRF or an F1 fleet, and a few of them fly scout or other support roles and may even be good pilots. The main body of f1 pvpers have 0 idea what the hell they're doing.
---
Oh I bet, I read on another reply some figure of 300 billion invested? For roughly 200 mil per hull before the spike, that's around 1500 hulls assuming force recons. Roughly 100 million profit for hull yields profit around 150 billion ISK. Very rough estimates on my part but still an impressive trade, and I would at least say you aim to make over 100 billion at minimum.
---
Btw miss ya mate, you were my favorite marketeer (albeit the only one I know lol). Would love to have ya back, otherwise I wish you the best in your future endeavors.
---
Side note, I sifted through your KB real quick out of curiosity. I saw [this](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77242686/) and recognized the killers name for some reason- swear I saw it before. [Turns out I did.](https://zkillboard.com/kill/76967717/) Not sure what you were doing in Curse, but hey, who would've thought.
---
There's no requirement to multibox, although really everyone should have a station trading alt in Jita at least.
---
What kind of unfathomably idiotic chain of reasoning would lead you to connect "people who can coordinate 1-man 30-account blops fleets by themselves" with "russian botters"?
---
Please, for everyone's safety, do not attempt to operate heavy machinery.
---
Kiting is only the meta if you are risk averse. Brawling ships still work very well, people are just too scared to use them. 
---
For example, everyone complains about ramjags. But that‚Äôs because the ramjag is the only real counter to kiters, something that‚Äôs fast and tanky enough to last against long range cruisers dps for a while. Against a brawler, jags just melt. They get 15 seconds from the adc, and then even with a triple rep fit they pop very quickly.
---
Nah, I looted 2b from wrecks this weekend. That buys me 8 more blingy retris or 20 more faction cruisers. Haven't bothered pvping in a long time.
---
I ran all the Pirate epic arc's and made a few mistakes along the way.  I now have over 5.0 standings with pirates and Nullsec diamond rats are my friends. (Still not there with Bloodraiders yet)  
---
Big shout out to suitonia for the Diamond Rat guide.
---
You are the #15 submitter of r/eve so far in 2019.
---
A while back now there was this Corp TRIAD in Ushra'khan that actually had its own internal missions it had created and its own LP store. I'm pretty sure they would even let blues utilize it. Their CEO at the time Det Resprox even made an external website that would allow other corporations to do the same with several tools built into it. It was called Pandora. Was a great idea that sadly was underutilized and required way to much work for one guy as far as I know. TRIAD is still around but I think the mission thing is gone and Det has won EVE sadly. I would love to see some of that functionality baked into corps by CCP personally.
---
Not everybody wants to join a nullsec alliance to be able to do fun things, my dude. Please continue being angry that other people have different opinions than you about a spaceship videogame.
---
I'll give you a special flair to *not* do that.
---
Well obviously, that's entirely too direct. When I was in a carebear alliance I marketseeded, I'd never say "buy my ____", I would say "holy hell these other dudes have _____ listed at 300% jita sell, I'm putting some up at Jita x 1.25". I made my first real billions doing that, that most egg is what I'm still pvping off of years later.
---
Play of the match right here!  What an incredible maneuver!
---
Cool. Guess my posting improved as well lol
---
&gt;multiboxing more than 2-3 accounts takes real skill and practice, and leaves you vulnerable in the event things don't go right. It's hard to extract 30 accounts from a counterdrop, after all.
---
That‚Äôs not what I said, and you didn‚Äôt give me an example of such an activity. If your argument is ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do everything in EVE solo‚Äù then that‚Äôs a really stupid position to take because of course you can‚Äôt.
---
It needs to be long enough that people (and bots) aren't just trying to wait it out. If CCP came out and announced that it would be like this for at least six months, then the numbers might start to mean something.
---
Also, this is making Eve dangerous again, which should attract new players - but they need to hear about it and believe in it before they start to become numerous.
---
I want to add EVE University to that list. 
---
One that is not strongly political aligned to someones null block.
---
I put together an extremely cheap Autocannon Stabber fit which can do T2 Electrical sites pretty easily. It gets a little scary when there's multiple enemies with Warp Scramblers, but otherwise it works pretty well, and the ship's so cheap (\~20 mil) that even if a filament does go south and you get blown up, you can replace it and try again. I never tried doing a T3 with it; I don't think it's actually good enough for that.
---
Main guns are 220mm Autocannons, which will track basically anything you find and still do decent damage to the larger ships, hitting the EM resist hole. You really wanna get into tight orbits around the larger things like battleships, and because you're a Stabber you're fast enough to easily do that. The Missiles aren't really a significant damage source, they're mostly just there to fill the slots, and there isn't enough Powergrid to fit Rapid Lights. You'll have the Shield Booster running continuously, and then punch the Micro when you need to close distance on something. I haven't tried downgrading anything in the fit, but you could probably get away with dropping some of the T2 modules to Meta-level. This fit will not work anywhere other than Electrical, because it needs the capacitor regen bonus to keep the booster on.

Just bought them. Are they auto applied to your account? I currently already had a MCT on running on my other toon...
---
Don't see how that proves multiboxing is in any way synonymous with botting, my dude.
---
a carrier can probably plex the char in about 9hs
---
Didnt they say the drop rate change was temporary when they changed it? Wonder if it'll ever actually swing back.
---
If you read my objections to local more carefully you'll see that I object to "free, perfect, immediate" intel. Zkill, even non-delayed, isn't perfect - people only appear on there if they kill or are killed, and if the kill is published. And obviously with a delay it isn't immediate.
---
I do see the argument for removing that intel (and the stats that dotlan relies on), but I don't think it's worth it to lose the interesting historical information you can get from seeing past kills.
---
Didnt you get the memo from the god emperor to skyteam?
---
5:1 minimum, or at least 3:1 cap superiority
---
Awesome !  Always like to hear market success stories.   I like to give feedback but let people make their own investments.  Ive been wrong before and will be wrong again one of these years
---
multiboxing.
---
FW mission spam, L5 missions ect, all ridiculously profitable - for ONE char.
---
yeah ideas that incorporate this thing don't work logically. I want FW missions to not get paid out FW LP, which would increase the value of LP as a whole, so the fighting payouts would be increased. But it's not great mechanics if the first thing that comes to mind is how to abuse it
---
Wow thought that ratting was no longer worh it ... Thank you !

Yeah the karma values flipped around election season, roughly.

I remember back in the day shen droping supers was actuslly a risky thing for most

The eve we knew is dead, replaced by carebears who reee when it doesnt go their way
---
CSM told CCP that the insane price of ancil's was hurting faction warfare.  Its one of the most used mods for frigate PVP and when they were 3-5mil each it made it difficult for new bro's to justify putting them on  a 500k T1 frig.   
---
They pushed hard to get the pricing down and i dont think we will ever see 3m+ ancil's ever again.
---
Who doesn't love a good summertime Crab Boil?
---
Each time you don't understand something, google it and try to find the answer. The Eve university website is a good place to start.
---
 If there is no answer, ask in the new player channel in game or the sub for newbros (I think the name is in this sub infos). Do it at your own rythm, but with the time it will make (a bit) more sense. I'm still learning, but I can say I definitely know waaay more now than when I first started (and I still have a loooooot of stuff to learn!)
---
As opposed to letting local stay in, letting the current meta destroy the game even more, and eventually shrugging and saying "o well" as EVE goes into a declining playerbase spiral?
---
lmao fuck you carebear
---
depends what you want to do.  capital and wh gameplay has strong incentives for a lot of alts.
---
something like DEDs, abyssals, ect?  Solo is just fine.  same for subcap pvp.
---
oh look init poster thinks he is able to muster decent independent thought
---
Yeah, it was a bit üòÇ
---
WHY CANT I HAVE SPACE SUBMARINES!?!?!?!?!?
---
Why should someone who doesn't want to participate in pvp be in pvp zones aka 0.0 in the first place?
---
High-sec would be a better place for them.
---
Oh I've seen that, great guide. Thought about doing it myself sometime later, after I max empire factions for all the locator agents in high/low, and sec status for CONCORD ships.
---
After that i might do pirate factions, but thanks to diplomacy IV, it's all +1.5 right now because base standing is like -0.3 or something like that. Friendly diamond rats are a super nice feature though, I'd agree.
---
If course, but why bother?  It is a multi player game to me.
---
The worm is honestly a victim of its own success, no one will ever fight it in FW, so you never see them outside of blobs
---
&gt; while Alpha VNI/bot carriers/supers are responsible for PLEX prices.
---
bots existed since the old times, don't kid yourself by thinking they're significantly worse now or whatever, as the usual advice goes, don't listen to reddit
---
Til in game standings are the same as strategicly blue
---
THANKS FOR THIS INTEL FREINDO, IMA NOW GO INFORM THE REST OF OUR LEADERSHIP THAT TAPI INVASION IS FINALY A GO
---
How was theblast pre-arranged fight in t1 crusiers between legacy and goons btw?
---
I guess I could emulate you and hide behind a random name and flair bait? That seems pretty brave eh?
---
I can always copy *REDACTED SUBREDDIT NAME*'s automod config. If it stops 4chan, it'll stop that.
---
We have mutaplasmids for DMG CON?! O.o
---
WOW... My orca might want one! :)
---
Yeah I remember they were doubling the cost of any t1 frigate fit. Probably impacting the meta in FW.
---
&gt; Because no matter how active you are, how skilled you are, how much knowledge you have, how much isk you spend, you cant see what isnt possible to see. I.e, cloaky and d-scan immune ships
---
You can see those ships on the gate - teamwork OP, have someone watch the gate. You can also see cloakies on dscan for a tick when they break cloak. You can see them landing on grid - only a bomber can decloak and lock you without a significant delay, and bombers are made of paper. Most of them aren't nullified so you can delay them by bubbling gates.
---
And then of course there's the counter of having a response fleet come and blow them up - covops and recon ships are all relatively weak in combat.
---
And sure, you'll lose a ship occasionally. This is Eve. You *should* lose ships occasionally, if you choose to play in the most dangerous areas.
---
I would like to see cynos affected by the decloak delay, it's a bit dumb that you can decloak and immediately cyno up. But if you get tackled by the tengu then it doesn't actually matter if the cyno has a delay.
---
I am genuinely confused, what ever made you think I ran bots? WKEND has always been a pvp alliance, and we never got kicked from Winterco, we have been blue with them, but never part of the coalition. The system we lived in was pretty good for people who wanted to make isk during boring times, but that was the limit of krabs doing anything from WKEND, aside from a few moons we owned (3), which we used for SRP. 
---
They provided us space and in exchange we pvp'd their enemies while we were in detorid. They were generous enough to have us as guests and setup infrastructure for us.
---
Hey now, he could have been mutilated as an adult^like^I^was
---
Hookbills and comets both need a nerf before facwar will be worth it again, at least for frigate duels. Small plexes are just dominated by assfrigs unless you can surprise them with something like a neut Tristan
---
Trying hard, trust me.
---
Just for the sake of sentiment contrarianism:
---
&gt;1. Cap DPS application reverted to the old standards
---
Actually yes.
---
&gt;2. Different damage thresholds and damage caps for capitals and subcapitals
---
Yet another exception which would further complicate the already complicated ruleset. This is already solved by 1. anyways: big ships = big dps but shit application. No need at all for damage caps.
---
&gt;3. Targettable station services
---
Sounds nice in theory but implementation would be horrible. Currently we have one object in space = one entity which can be targeted and for a good reason. Imagine wanting to target the entire station but instead you lock only one part of it (and vice versa). May as well reintroduce POSes.
---
&gt;4. Structure repair time
---
Let me stop you right there. Imagine one station being in like 8 different damage states at once. What a clusterfuck.
---
&gt;5. A center of governance for nullsec entities
---
I'll let this one slide.
---
There are actually couple of fixes which are easy to make and would improve the gameplay immensely:
---
1. Corp/alliance in null must designate 36 hours per week in which all its structures are vulnerable. No individual settings/special cases.
---
2. Remove damage caps and timers from anything except big upwell structures. 
---
3. Only one structure with damage timers can be anchored in a system. No exceptions.
---
4. Asset safety in null -&gt; 25% of shit is destroyed, 25% ejected, the rest is saved.
---
5. No cynos.
---
was super easy (can do the epic arcs in an interceptor) 
---
With the Glamorx-75 and social V, I was able to get reed to over 5.0 with gurista and angels in just a few evenings.  Its much easier to get your pirate standing up than faction standings. Running the epic arc once brought me from -8.0 to +4.0.
---
I think people use the word perfect to describe local to much. Saying someone is online in the system tells you very little, as we know with afk campers. Jumping into a system and seeing 10 in local tells you basically nothing, they could be cloaked, they could be docked, they could be mining or ratting, they could be baiting. There's to much that a person could be doing to make local not be perfect.
---
Look at how many of those blops videos end up catching the guy on the 2nd or 3rd attempt at combat scanning them at a safe. With citadels, they can just warp off to a friendly citadel and tether as soon as you come in system.
---
note it depends how skilled you are and fully taking advantage of ALL sources, not just pure ticks.  faction drops, escalations, and LP all add up considerably.
---
These structures have been tinfoil shitposted for years. I think it's more exasperation than defensiveness.
---
Hyena is a hard counter to jaguars. Normally when I saw a gang with one I just wouldn‚Äôt bother going for initial tackle because it is suicide. 
---
If you dual web a jag at 40km, it has to disengage or die. If you have a long point keres you might even manage to kill it, but just the presence of the hyena is enough to keep jaguars a non-factor as long as you are competent.
---
U need some education, youngster!!!
---
Eve University, has the downloable classes and letures, that cover the whole expanse of New Eden
---
Don't fly at him, have inty 5, use a fleet into, overheat scram, abyssal roll your t2 scrams and keep the 10km ones for inty.
---
Don't drive by scram tackle if your gang isn't ready to deal with them right away.
---
You want to scram from the very edge of scram [range.](https://range.be) Be ready to repulse your mwd, be ready to heat it.
---
You really should be able to go 5k/s. If the jag is faster than 4k/s, he's a snaked bastard or has no ADC.
---
feels more like the "Summer of Tears"
---
Not according to them.  That said, I don't believe anyone who says they PAY to crab on a dozen accounts.
---
Depends on tank/adc, but probably not. Still, a nosprey has a neut, worst case you just neut the scram off and escape
---
Hi5 to all those people
---
Do you like spreadsheets? Do you want to become a data analyst? Play EVE.
---
ramjag has a nos. Properly timed 1 nos can keep a scram running against any number of neuts
---
https://imgur.com/a/3Yz2iiC
---
I believe l4's are better, mining very rarely done singleboxed and i have no idea why people do vnis at all. Is there something that keeps those "normal" people outside of fun and profitable pve content?
---
Nothing.
---
Trade the keres for a hyena (webs) or sentinel (neuts). A ramjag doesn‚Äôt really care about getting damped, but if you turn his mwd and scram off with the sentinel, or dual web him, he is useless
---
So you subbed and joined goons, the safest place to crab, during the blackout.
---
hmmmmmmm.
---
Holy shit, I didn't know the next part of the GloryHammer saga came out!
---
Not if he has a web. Triple masb is doable but not without sacrificing literally everything else, including a nos
---
Eve is basically f2p game. In f2p game those who play for free must serve as a content (and pray) for players who pay. But those krabs with 12 accounts don't create content for anybody, they only create inflation. So CPP (I hope) is going to fix it. If any krab with 12 accounts unsubscribe - it won't change anything except making PLEX slightly cheaper.
---
It's telling that in the all time list there is Uitra, Couster, Clellinon and Deepari.
---
Half of the eight labelled bubbles are new players systems (career agent systems), where the deaths are dominated by new players dying to NPCs.
---
Where you also making throwaway reddit accounts to post moronic arguments against new mechanics that slowly made this game worst and worst for PVPers year after year for the past (at least) three years?
---
Or are you just bitching because the balance stopped being almost completely favouring *your* playstyle?
---
If you don't to be in a dangerous enviorment get the fuck out of Nullsec.
---
It's not about what are the odds that it WAS a person, it's about possibility itself. You can't ban an account if there is a chance. On top of that warping indefinitely is not against EULA/ToS, so for what exactly do you want to ban him anyway? Can you prove that it was a bot, without any doubt? Everyone is so happy to vote for ban even in weak cases as long as they are not the one being banned.
---
What if that was a person and he was trying to buy some time, made you busy by letting you kill him until his friends warp and kill you in revenge? And maybe you just warped away a minute before they arrived? Can you tell me it was not possible?
---
Not super fast, but not slow either. Maybe 30 seconds depending on the fit. If the Kiki has ewar support from webs or neuts it‚Äôs a lot easier
---
Hyena also works. If the ramjag suddenly goes 1.5 km/s he is no longer a factor
---
It's mostly a joke.  Gloryhammer is actually a power metal band that's trying to make fun of power metal.  It turns out though, that if you parody power metal and try to make it more absurd, it just makes some *really* good power metal.
---
Unsub and biomass.  But first contract your stuff to "orally fixated"
---
Its a sandbox. Depends on how you define progress
---
You can log in a few hours a week and be fine, trust me.
---
Absolutely, your skills progress no matter what, as long as you keep putting skills in queue.  Get in a good corp quick and they should teach you how to survive no matter how much you play.
---
Oh they definitely do die that quick.  Despite appearances and unless you are full Rabid hull tank those things are made of tissue paper.
---
1. Denial  
---
2. Anger  
---
3. Bargaining  
---
4. Depression  
---
5. Acceptance
---
With a nos it only has two masb fit. It might survive one clip from a solo nosprey, but it won‚Äôt do well against anything bigger. And it still won‚Äôt survive the second clip
---
I like how the hot pockets are blue
---
I so hate that phrase?  Does that mean the rest of the human race isn't grinding life for some isk?
---
This was my concern as well.  Pretty much in order to do mining efficiently and in a worthwhile manner you have to be under a super umbrella currently to make it feasible and that's not cool.  I do like the increased destruction and fights but I do see the industry issues with it which was alot of previous arguments before super umbrellas and even still recently against cloaky camping.
---
Every 10(?) regular missions you will get an opportunity from a nearby story agent who will give you a mission that will improve your faction standing.
---
Also I believe doing the epic story arcs give standing faction as well.
---
Oh yes totally, I often play only an hour a day, then like 6 more at night.
---
Gross, you said boomer unironically

[LASER POWERED GOBLIN SMASHER!](https://youtu.be/tKlVYJTSzuU)
---
No? It increased the amount going to market in abundance to the point of crashing the mineral markets.  It had the opposite effect, mind you it is such a severe opposite effect that I would argue its bad.
---
The dominant meta in Eve has been harshly shaken up many many times before, requiring players to adapt to changes that might not immediately benefit them as a random carebear in the biggest alliance ingame, and you‚Äôd know that if you had actually played it as long as you say and weren‚Äôt just angry you can‚Äôt get instant free intel anymore.
---
I didn‚Äôt even realize, I‚Äôm going to pay so much more attention to that now, thank you, Eve is truly beautiful.
---
What activity in WoW can you not do without joining a guild?
---
aaah ok, and how do I know that the story agent gives me that? sorry im a noob in mission running
---
A massively superior, bulky, capital weapon designed for a certain purpose shouldn't move at the same agility and deployment on field as sub capitals designed for roaming.  
---
If you think differently, you're the problem.
---
You can increase your standings with a Faction a few ways but also be careful as you can destroy your standing with alternate factions to the point you might not be allowed in their space   
---
1. Running 16 missions will give you a storyline mission that will affect faction standings  
---
2. Run the SOE Epic arc.  You can chose 1 faction to get a large bonus to at the end of the Arc  
---
3. Run the Faction epic arc - The armarr one is difficult, you will need to be able to run level 4's to do it.   
---
4. Cosmos missions - some constellations have mission agents that will give you storyline items and faction inc.
---
That's the point. You can't find 1v1s because everyone and their mother has alts or are gatecamping or some bullshit. I like EVE in concept, but I don't want to have to do chores to pay for PvP and I don't like how hard it is to find ""fair"" fights.
---
The memes are salt are delicious, though. It's why I still follow the subreddit.
---
Jesus, the economics aren‚Äôt complicated here...
---
Fewer people PLEXing means lower PLEX prices which means a reduced incentive to purchase PLEX with cash.  Simultaneous active subscriptions are a demand signal.  If that signal stays -3000 for any prolonged period of time, then PLEX will drop and fewer people will be willing to trade real money for a commodity which gives them a diminished return.
---
And risk averse theme park play is apparently a way of life.
---
The amount of "no cynos" im seeing lately warms my heart.
---
Dark mode everything always
---
Rule of Acquisition 156: When no appropriate rule applies, make one up.
---
What is a carebear in this context?
---
WH space is different than null though, I wish people would stop comparing the two. It's much harder to Target a specific wormhole group or camp wormhole space than it is any given null system, unless you're in umbrella space.
---
Currently we have no local in null, what would be a nice middle ground would be
---
**DELAYED LOCAL** You know, the words that show up on the image CCP is using for this "event"
---
As in, you have a 10-30 second delay between jumping and showing up in local. Pirate ships could lengthen this. 
---
However, the fundamental problem still exists that both the hunter and the defender can just light a cyno and bring in a bazillion ships. That and outside of a defensive umbrella fleet, almost no one has a chance against a decent small gang as they will just dogpile on a target, kill it and then flee. 
---
As it stands, why even bother being in space? 
---
Lets say I wanna mine as a solo player. My options are: 
---
One rorq: complete with a rolling 5 minute season pass to get fucked. Oh and I can't save my drones as well anymore. And my panic was nerfed. And my yield was nerfed the... 5th time? I lost count. 5 bil investment for roughly 100 mil an hour
---
Orca mining: This mines at about 1/6 the speed of a rorq, but for less investment, can work in highsec, and can easily escape most hunters. 600-800 mil investment, mines maybe 20-25 mil an hour
---
Exhumer mining: Safter and just as easy to escape with as orca, mines about equal to an orca, 300 mil investment for 20-25 mil an hour, barring boosts. 
---
Or, I could get an ishtar and afk my way to an easy 60-80+ mil an hour plus drops for even less risk and the same investment as an exhumer. 
---
Or, I could run combat sites making whatever the loot gods deem I get for the day. 500 mil to 4 bil investment
---
Or, I could easily just carrier rat, but with nerfed application, NSA warp prohibition and other compounding issues, why would I spend 1-2 bil on a carrier for 50-100 mil an hour? 
---
**It's not like this change does anything more then try to apply a bandaid fix for great, underlying problems within the game. But so long as the pvpers are happy, I might as well be an npc.**
---
It's every 16 missions.  When you finish your 16th mission with a single NPC corporation, you will get an EVE Mail from an Agent saying that they have a special job for you.  That is the storyline mission.  The storyline mission will be of the same level as the mission you handed in to trigger the storyline mission.  So if you were to hand in 15 level 1 missions, and then hand in a single level 2 mission for your 16th, you'd get a level 2 storyline mission.
---
The agent will often be in a different system to the one you're running missions in.  At low level, it'll probably be a 'bring me this ore' kind of mission.  You'll often find that the ore is for sale in the agent's station.  It'll cost more than if you bought it from a hub and shipped it over, but it's convenient.
---
Also, have a look at the Sisters of EVE Epic Arc.  It's a quite long chain of missions, but the rewards are pretty good.  You can run it in a destroyer, but it's easier in a cruiser.  You'll get the option to help one of the four main factions at the end.  You'll get a pretty nice standings boost for that faction when you're done.  You can run the arc every 3(?) months.
---
Right click everything!
---
The part of it not actually being fun.
---
I like to shoot people, so the less time and effort I have to put into getting isk for that the better.
---
Really, that simple.
---
Thats what the source says
---
Pretty sure you get some kind of notification from the Storyline Agent.  It's been a long time since I mission ran, sorry.  I know they used to pop up in the Office window when you were docked.
---
Also know there are missions against the other main factions, you should reject those as killing the ships will reduce your standing with the other factions.  You can only reject one mission every hour I think.
---
Some info here:
---
[https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Standings\_101#Sources\_of\_Standing\_Gain](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Standings_101#Sources_of_Standing_Gain) 
---
I was wrong, it's 16 missions for every Storyline mission.
---
But have you got clear vision?
---
He does!
---
Three and a half actually.
---
You will not understand a thing, and then more you think you understand the more you will get further confused. And that's fine all of us bittervets can go on about transversal and points and ramjags and rats. We've all sunk thousands of hours into eve.
---
Bumble around for a bit, warp around, do the tutorial bits, figure out how to go somewhere, how to dock, how to use your assets.
---
Then try customizing your overview a bit, do at least the security noob missions. Read the mission description carefully and if they give you a ship before a mission, use that ship.
---
Once you've done that. Then figure out what to do next. The key to early success in eve is to specialize ruthlessly into a single ship/fit/job. That's how you'll get to 80% of perfect character "skills" in the minimum time, the point where your real-world skill at playing eve can tip the balance.
---
i get all the fucks from your mum, scrub
---
i did that a lot lol
---
If the "infinite farmable skill points" work with triglavians in abyssmals (and it probably will), its another instance of CCP having no idea what the hell they're doing.  If this is the case, all of those skillfarm bots are going to be running T1 abyss 24/7 to farm a literal assload of SP to sell.
---
Point of order! Ships in the right hand column should have purple icons.
---
A wall of text worth scaling.
---
i guess you could not adapt so ccp had to kill local

For hi and low sec Concord should offer insurance on collateral.

I tried EVE for the first time back in 2011. I joined a small HiSec industry corporation within a few days of starting, and it did not take long for me to lose all interest -- most of the people in the corporation were offline during my regular playtimes, and as a newbie I didn't really know that the grass actually was greener elsewhere. I lost interest in the game within a few weeks, and stopped playing.
---
A couple years later (June of 2013, to be specific), I decided to try EVE again. This time, I joined up with ROC Academy. I was excited, and aimed to be the greatest pilot to ever fly internet spaceships.
---
Unfortunately, it was not meant to be. Within a month or two of returning to EVE, I found out I was getting deployed to Iraq. Now, I don't know if you fine folks know anything about the internet situation over there, but it's not exactly condusive to doing anything at all, much less playing a game like EVE. Even old-school dial-up internet is better, because at least dial-up is reliable.
---
And so, EVE slowly became a distant memory for me. I got married, moved around, eventually got out of the military, and started a new life, self-employed and working from home.
---
Then, a week or two ago, I saw an article on Twitter with some sort of clickbaity title along the lines of, "Has EVE Online just SCREWED All of its Players?!". Because I had nothing better to do, I clicked and read the article, which was talking about the Drifter invasion of SovNull.
---
Although my experience with EVE was not extensive enough to have any opinion on the events discussed within the article, the article *did* do one thing for me: it reminded me that EVE is a game that does, indeed, exist.
---
I find myself now at a point in my life where I actually in need a long-term game to play, a game I can play to keep my sanity in spite of my work.
---
After mulling it over for a few days, I decided to give EVE another go. This time, I wanted to do it right:  no more random corporations, no more trying to figure out game mechanics on my own, and no more sticking only to the "safe" activities like HiSec mining. I logged into my account for the first time in roughly 6 years, and found that I had a little over 6M skill points and about 1.3B ISK from back when I played years ago.
---
I promptly dropped an application to EVE University, and was eventually accepted within a week or so. I also joined a Discord group for EVE military veterans. Within the last few days, I've had more fun in EVE than with any other game I've played in recent memory.
---
I've gone on roaming fleets, filling the roles of DD, Logi, and Scout. I've spent time exploring wormholes, LowSec, and NullSec in my Astero as both the hunter and the hunted. I've attended every EVE University class and event I could possibly fit into my schedule. I've met new people, hung out in Mumble, and have already had the opportunity to help newbros even newer than me. I intend to take up the role of FC within the next couple of weeks once I familiarize myself a bit more with the basic FC commands and methodology.
---
EVE is the game I needed in a post-military life. I've come to realize that I miss the comeraderie and some of the responsibility the Army provided me, but which I no longer have working alone at home. I miss mentoring people. I miss leading people. I miss working with other people towards a common goal. EVE provides me the opportunity for all of the above.
---
Do I have an opinion on the Drifter invasions, or on the NullSec Blackout? No, not really. I simply don't have enough EVE experience to draw any sort of meaningful conclusions about them. I am, however, extremely thankful for them, because the media buzz they generated reminded me that EVE exists, which brought me back to this game after many years away from it.
---
You asked for a story, but this is only the prolouge.
---
[Zkillboard Character History as Proof](https://zkillboard.com/character/91224918/)
---
everyone left cuz eve was cancer, look how many new players came and stayed with citadels
---
The above reads like a pysops post  aimed at manipulating the market to me ;)
---
Hes not.
---
Yes you totally can.
---
&gt; Can you play Eve Online "casually"?
---
Well, you can "play" Eve Online casually.
---
Very
---
&gt; We have occasionally have set out a couple rorqs for bait to lure in some pvp'ers to kill. Losing a rorq or 2 due to blops is all part of the fun. But it's not fun if you can't prepare to defend yourself.
---
Wait hang on what. Even with local, if you're getting blops dropped, there was only one dude in local before he opened the cyno. Removing local has made literally no difference to defending against blops drops.
---
Did it work?
---
Lmao this won't affect Goons, local doesn't matter when you can instantly summon a supercap fleet
---
Not gonna lie, I'm enjoying the shit out of this event. I've killed my first Rag, turbodunked Forts that supernerds don't even show up to defend, learned a lot about tackling by tackling a ton of salty wormholers that complain about fights not being fair, and generally enjoyed something other than ratting. 
---
I've actually been thanked by a few corpmates for traveling around and defending krabbers. 
---
I could see a smaller corp having trouble with small groups who box a few accounts with big ships but.....
---
BRAVE IS RECRUITING!
---
I make enough to pay my subscription on 4 accounts with in game currency (and profit above that quite well) doing like 5-10 hours a week.
---
But the game can definitely capture any addictive nature you have.
---
Why would you pay money to sit there and mine? I don't get it.
---
Literally first line on the first application clicked
---
&gt;CCP Reykjavik are looking for a world-class Production Director to lead production efforts on EVE Online.
---
Yeah there's really just no way to know.

Why aren't you using Google Docs?

I‚Äôm swimming against this year‚Äôs current.
---
Dont forget bhaals
---
Dem relic sites tho.
---
&gt; no Catch
---
but if there was, n3 already died and PL retired so nobody to install you there.
---
A few hours a day is not casually. A few hours a week is casually. And there are plenty who only play casually but if you get involved in bigger nullsec alliances you may be required to attend a certain amount of CTAs per month.
---
Borrowing isk.
---
You are asking the wrong person.  But Farmville and Sim City both make money.
---
It‚Äôs 25% off the top.
---
Depending on what they are losing, you can sell the replacement stuff to your friends. 
---
You reap while they weep.
---
I mean that seems a little extreme. But knocking you out of being able to fly one for a while seems interesting.
---
We only got blops dropped once. And that was because of an awoxer so, there was no neut that we saw. 
---
The bait I'm talking about is for passers by thinking they can get an easy rorq kill.
---
"If it's fit, you're guaranteed to escape" so you're ignoring that you simply have to have more disruptors than they have stabs equipped.
---
Don‚Äôt
---
Did you mean to post that particular "This is Eve"? hahahaha
---
Don't forget that so much fantasy is based on rock-paper-scissors:
---
- Charging horse is fast - kills archer before second shot
---
- Spearman is slow - archer can keep shooting until dead
---
- Spearman is long and pointy - Charging horse gets impale.
---
Eve is rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock - for EACH weapon type, and EACH defense type and for the ships (platforms for the weapons and defense) themselves.
---
So build them? Build a bunch even, sell the rest, you can name the price if there's no competition.
---
Short answer - Yes 
---
Long answer - Yeeeeeeeasss
---
fuck that I can't even get a centurion set for my falcon alts wtf is this
---
Everyone knows that, and everyone avoids it - in that sense, it's not really a problem.
---
It's just a "no small scale pvp is going to happen in a novice in this systems" - situation when one is around, and that's annoying.
---
Someone please reformat this!
---
A GTX 1070ti  and higher should be good for 1440p, max settings, 60fps
---
Jesus hot-micing Christ, close up shop people the game is officially dead!
---
&lt;3 o7
---
Done! At least for me...
---
Sounds like a second job.
---
I adapted, I played this damn game through all of the null buffs. It's your turn now.
---
It is like learning anything worthwhile it is difficult to learn at first hard as hell a little later , only when you actually master something do you really realize how little you know, find people who can help you but realize some of those people are the worst kinds of people, some are the best.
---

---
ah the good old self fullfilling prophecy. nice one OP
---
It is the best one :)
---
To much work and logistics to get all that stuff out there. I'm making about a billion a day right now for an hour or two of work because of the blackout and it only required 100m of investment.
---
**Capital application vs subcaps**
---
- Delete HAW
---
- Delete NSA, or make it only apply to lock time against enemy fighters
---
- Delete tackle fighters
---
- Nerf application of fighters, and speed of fighters under MWD
---
**Capital force projection**
---
- Add jump fatigue to Ansiblex gates
---
- Don't allow cynos to be lit anywhere you can't drop a depot/inhib (i.e. within 75km of any structure)
---
- Give cynos a spool up time
---
**Interdiction**
---
- Mostly solved by changes to cynos
---
My favorite part of this post is referencing Excel and then using a screenshot of Word.
---
Lmao you might want to tell Goons that then, since most of the people talking about unsubbing seem to be in their ranks.
---
There's ways to avoid such stuff. Get a throw away raitaru.
---
Lol wow is this where we‚Äôre going, 
---
 there was a time when wow wasn‚Äôt completely awful and that time was when to do the endgame content or even just certain quests you had to be in a guild and your reputation mattered 
---
Wow died when they watered it down to spoon feed all the retards out there to the point where you can do pretty much anything solo, up to mythic raiding it killed the community,
---
The game was hard in the beginning which made people foster relations and make friends,
---
 its friends that will keep you in the game
---
If you have friends you can have fun with you have no need of alts, I fact you could argue that 4 ok people are better than 1 really good player multi boxing 4 accounts 
---
Just get out there and have fun doing whatever it is you enjoy about eve
---
CCP!  Do the Umbrella next!
---
DAE le nullkrabbbbs xD please love me

yes, you could

I've been waiting for someone to finally post this since I first saw it in the store thank you for making dreams come true.

there is not enough onyx for me to have a HIC roam, literally unplayable
---
Those guys who go from level 4 mission running to null sec and do nothing but rat or mine all day in bling ships but if an ibis is reported 10 jumps out they dock up
---
Its probably the most friendly game to casual play you will ever encounter, been playing casually since 2006
---
You're sort of right, it's perfect from the point of view of a local krab, but imperfect for the hunter. So it's actually even worse than what I said before.
---
Lol.  I didn't even see that I just assumed they were omnis.   Wow.
---
see you're thinking Blops is dropping 100 bombers on a carrier. thats not really blops mate. Watch some videos by [Gulnar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZv7Km-4N1w), the first few minutes of [Olmeca's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vb9HR5ij_-w) or some of [John Drees'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glDlo8pjlP8) videos.

Do we know what NPCs?  What the cap is on earnable skill points in a day?  Any further info at all?

Replying here for visibility and because you can't report a post for being "misleading".
---
/r/Eve mods, I'm curious why this post is tagged as misleading after Falcon's response: https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cdm73l/blackout_now_forever/
---
whereas this post **hasn't** been marked as "Misleading" with /u/CCP_Lebowski  's response explaining that this isn't "anything new"?
---
Shouldn't this post also be marked as "Misleading" by the same logic?
---
I was mocking the recent rash of posts and comments like the one I was imitating. I thought the level of hyperbole would be enough to clarify that it was sarcastic, but I'm a baboon so I thought wrong
---
it appears that the carebears that made them are on strike
---
The fact that they have names -does- imply they have a perceived purpose (even if not implemented) though. Otherwise if you just needed placeholders, I'd expect to just see "PLACEHOLDER_001" through "PLACEHOLDER_99999" for example.
---
Agreed. And the season of skills can fuck off as well. I already have my characters on 3-month subs... They should be giving all players with 3/6/1yr subs this MCT deal for free. Not this fucking dog-n-pony show like they are doing ME a favor by making me spend an ADDITIONAL 40 bucks on time I don't need... Which I would have already spent on MCT if I wanted it... Which I don't. 
---
Give free SP and skins or gtfo CCP.
---
Scan sites to run. Only real way to rat without local anyway
---
please re-read the fucking post lmao and what sub it is in
---
im not in the tapirium of the galaxy

---
We are reading different history books. Granted I am at a 102 level but most wars we studied were motivated ultimately by egos. It helped me decide to go into psychology.
---
As someone that has only been following the drama here on r/eve, this one really got to me. I spent most of my years in wh space and loved it but scanning got rather tedious. Your comment actually might motivate me to resub.
---
l4 are not better. at all.   burners are.  but l4s are alot more inefficient and slower for isk/hr
---
carrier ratting is easily 3 to 4x more profitable.  and thats without the loot, or escalations, or faction spawns
---
Read a couple posts, how hard could it be to figure out..
---
A krab just grinds isk for the sake of growing his wallet while otherwise not being proactive about creating content. 
---
If you make billions by PvEing and are a filthy pingwarrior or F1 monkey that leeches on the content other people create for you, you are a lowlife krab and a filthy parasite.
---
If you make billions by PvEing and spend that money by actively creating content for you and for others you¬¥re a chad eve player and earned yourself the right to not get ridiculed by the rest of the community.

Frat exec openly admitting to botting, but yeah keep defending them mate.
---
&gt;  Most of those 3-6 month old characters who got talked into joining 0.0 alliance should be back to where they are progression and skill wise: empire, lowsec and Provi
---
... to other games
---
So in terms of economics and bettering the game. Is it good to have these two lines nearer each other ?   
---
Im not too into this stuff to please explain.
---
0 would be a good number.
---
I feel like he was trying to show a new bro some cool vids and linked him that one on accident, haha.
---
I am really thinking about popping a Red Bull, and stay all night and try to find me a Bot which I will stuck in a warping loop. To prove to you, that really a crazy person would feed me 1000 capsules. 
---
&gt; What if that was a person and he was trying to buy some time, made you busy by letting you kill him until his friends warp and kill you in revenge? And maybe you just warped away a minute before they arrived? Can you tell me it was not possible? 
---
No it was not possible since the space was pretty much dead at this hour. And Chinese were sleeping at this time, I came thoruhg like whole region about 30+ jumps to find this guy, because remember this was at the time, when Dotlan did not worked.
---
&gt;  On top of that warping indefinitely is not against EULA/ToS, so for what exactly do you want to ban him anyway?  
---
You are really making this into something that it is not. I mean I have stumbled upon a VNI that I wrecked to half hull, warped to next system because I knew it was a bot, because they always do the same cycle, they put their drones on you to attack you and then they start to align and warp out. Then I came back, cloaked up waited a minute or so, he came back to that same site, and I think he had his programme setted up badly, because the VNI was not repaired. I attacked again and guess what, wrecked him. But I did not post that Kill because it is very questionable if that was a bot or a bad player. 
---
On my journeys also saw like 5 VNIs multiboxing, which they could wreck my Tengu pretty easily. But guess what happened I decloaked took the one furthest out, let their drones slowboat towards me, and I just waited to see if they are actually going to attack me all at once, the funniest shit was, they all IMMEDIATELY started to target me at the same time, and even their drones movement were synchronized, and they all warped off at the same time, If it was a real person he coudlve blapped me easily. Very easily. But again to Questionable.
---
So I'll try and not be dramatic, but I've been playing off and an (including an extensive stint in wormholes) as a solo account since 2007.
---
Isk making, there are some activities I don't do because they're profitable due to their scalability (like mining) but I feel pretty comfortable with doing sites or filaments.
---
The instances I feel at a great disadvantage is when I need intel (an alt for jumping gates) scanning (fitting scanning onto a decent pvp boat is arguably not doable) tackle (getting the initial tackle is a task usually for interceptors and such) and having pocket reps (intrinsic to that is having more than one ship).  
---
In an alt free world, this is all good organization/team building, but because the tasks are so simple - for better or for worse - it's more reliable to just have 2 - 4 accounts.
---
I guess to illustrate how I understood the above guy is: If I'm flying my active deimos vs another guys active deimos and he has boosts or rr or EW on his alt, there is no practical way I win the fight.  I won't cry P2W because I could plex with isk for an account, but it does rub me the wrong way how powerful having multiple accounts is.
---
Ba dum tss
---
It wasn't me, i swear
---
I have been doing this for years without knowing it had a name. You begin to start to recognize names and patterns when you do this stuff. I'm pretty certain I am in cadence with a goon on a specific rig in a specific system.
---
Like ships passing in the night, never destined to meet.
---
I imagine the core motivation was curbing botting and RMT.
---
The killing spree already started.
---
Don't see problems, see opportunities. That or stop bitching.
---
&gt;  I'm curious why this post is tagged as misleading after Falcon's response: 
---
This post was stickied by another mod. I put the flair there because it was stickied.
---
&gt; whereas this post hasn't been marked as "Misleading" with /u/CCP_Lebowski 's response explaining that this isn't "anything new"?
---
Same as the above. This post wasn't stickied. When we stickied something it's speaking in an 'official' capacity on behalf of r/eve, in a sense.
---
It's also worth mentioning that this post is *wrong*, not misleading. Many in the thread have labeled it as such. The same was not true for the blackout thread.
---
&gt; Carrier ratting is still a thing and Is it possible to pay Plex whit this activity
---
If you want to spend 12 or more hours of your day ratting to buy a plex instead of doing anything else in the world to get a month of gametime, you can. You might want to check current fits. The activity you prefer has also been nerfed - so look for info on that. 
---
Moving forward you should probably find a CCP endorsed way to play or suffer the beating. Try T4/T5 abyss runs or null burners. Unlimited abyss/missions exist so you can run these infinitely unlike ratting which has a finite number of sites which can be active and competition for those sites.
---
You can Deploy all you want but if you Deploy and have no CAR did you Really Deploy REEEEEEEEEEE INC
---
I feel honored to be on this list.
---
/u/Jibrish can we get a "Misleading" tag on this post like you did here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cdm73l/blackout_now_forever/

It seems like this is confirmation that they are not "new structures", directly from CCP's mouth.
---
irl ing i pray 4 Gaben every day
---
Punctuation: Use it.  Fuck!  Your word salad is cancerous.
---
Nice anecdote, bud
---
I pray everyday for the extermination of C4 space. Why? Because The common C4 linemember, due to weeks of genetic inbreeding via ts3 since their chains are fucking shit so they cant get any members, has been rendered retarded, autistic, and without senses of honor, armor brawls, or pvp mentality. The large C4 "communities" are actually cancerous growths caused by an inherited genetic mutation in what was once the frontal lobe of the brain due to high levels of liquid spud in the brain. This is also known as radiated C4 spudbrain. Look at WH tapi brave division. They live in a fucking C4 wolf rayet. Cancer on top of cancer.The daily routine of the common c4 corps consists of scanning, scanning, scanning, scanning and when you get something other than a C3 site runner passive rattlesnake ( that still kills like half your fleet and mjds out) you roll out content with yachts. Then you ping for a mining fleet and get dunked on by a couple frigs because you left the frig hole open like a classic c6 russian dread runner. When the C4 corps are getting camped and thus mining is unavailable, c4 directors have been known to release their pent up mining blueballs on their own members, looking for the most minuscule excuse to enforce C4 commissar tapi/bee like laws on newbros and executing them via koolaid injections ( with the poison, in game)C4 corps have an irrational fear of high class space. They imprint this tapi like mentality on all their members via mining links. They unironically think,no, believe that just mentioning the slight, very minuscule possibility of moving to C5 space is gonna spawn HK and lazerhawks in their C4 wh like some fucking voldemort hitler shit ICBM curse on their gay ass azbel and print 350 caps out of it to evict them. If they dare move to C5 space they wholeheartedly believe their new wh would be preseded by HK and hawks via 10,000 dread alts.But C4 corps are evolving, c4 corps killed hk, they helped init, everyone knows this but their biggest secret is that they know how to kill C5 corps without even undocking. Please take a look at lazerhawks discord server, specially the members avatars. Have you noticed something? Yes, you have. the lazerhawks discord members avatars makes you think you are in a furry convention discord server. I rather mine fucking veldspar in tdsin home hole in a gila than look at that unholy heretical discord server again. like fucking holy shit what the fuck michael, purge that thrash asap. C4 corps implanted their spudbrain furry shit on C5 space to kill corps from within. lazerhawks can still be saved from this heresy, once they are purged by fire from glorious, honorable, weeb/furry free C2&lt;NS/C5 masterrace corps. The rest of the non-infected wormhole pvp corps ( except wolf rayet corps/ duralexx/ holesale/ hole control/ pancake bs users) need to group up and evict and burn this thrash from wormhole space. If some furry c4 wormholer starts throwing buzzwords like ‚Äúwe are wormholers too‚Äù and ‚Äúwhat have we done wrong‚Äù, feel free to ignore them and evict them at will. The general rule is if you normalize the extermination of c4, the wh bushido law will have no choice but to follow suit.
---
Most alliances will call buying an relisting higher ‚Äúblue fucking‚Äù, but it‚Äôs still a good idea. Just be aware that they might kick you if they find out.

Not to make this about campers, but cloaking campers also prevent perfect Intel for krabs. There is also a question of what a person is doing or where they are.

It was invite only for an hour and some change to go with the launch of the blackout.

This is the one game where you've already won before even starting to play.

AND since you cannot make isk at the same rate as before, you are now going to have to purchase a PLEX to sell for ISK.   It's all 1's and 0's.  They can take industry down and artificially pump isk into the market for you to spend purchased PLEX on.
---
Or, they are just being dicks to a group of their customers and forcing them to play the sandbox game differently.

So I'm against the blackout for a simple reason. It's not creative. It's a pretty bad bandage on a festering wound that's the current meta. We're all playing muninns online that's fueled by rorqs and super carriers. All the not block players are about to reee at that but its true. Yalls input doesnt exactly matter. It's the people like goons test frat and PH they're the largest content generators in the game. This event and change stopped and or slowed down the pace of 2 fairly large conflicts. With delve forward deployed crabs were fair game and legacy forces actively skirmishing with the option for major fights around the corner daily. Now imperium is at home. Horde is turtling into kalv expanse and the pace of legacy aggression against winter co hasnt really felt the same. It may look like its kept up or increased but it doesn't feel it. Active players are down for sure because this blackout and drifter invasion. It's why they're doing these events to fudge the numbers in favor of it working but past a few weeks from now we're going to have local back in what I hope is delayed although its dumb to make it a structure unless it runs on pure liquid ozone. I'd love that

Man my Corp requires a suit and tie be worn at all times while logged in, I would love to find a more casual play style
---
This post is quality!
---
Lol
---
Can I get a TLDR up in here?
---
I honestly hope they keep Blackout. PvP has been crazy since it started for me.
---
So, since the state of the game forces you to blob outside of highsec and highsec corps (that do everything, so you can't specialize), you could be a WH corp but they are too common to be novel.
---
As such, I don't think there's any new or novel way for a corp to operate. You could offer merc services, but starting from scratch on that is effectively impossible. There's already established freight services, WH monitoring groups, ganking groups, ect. 
---
Stagnate is what I'd call the current state of the game. Build up your skills, isk and friends. If an opportunity shows it self, consider going after it.

CCP PLZ, new expansion **EVE OPPORTUNITY** : More power to the small group, less power (projection) to the big ones

Poor guy can't fit is tristan and just gets downvoted. One less ship for you to maybe find and maybe have the guts to shoot I guess. The absolute state of the eve PVPer.
---
Think of the bots. Oh my, how awful, what would we do without them?
---
Long neuts like a sentinel or curse work pretty well. However ram jags are still incredibly threatening. If they play it well and you don‚Äôt have long webs or neuts, it‚Äôs usually a death sentence
---
Dude, you are talking about theory, im telling you that in reality any real threat will be different. Yet you refuse to listen.
---
People set up traps by going into a specific system long before they actually spring the trap. If you wait one TZ most likely no one who scouted those ships on the gate will be around to tell the next TZ. 
---
You have to actually listen to what Im telling you because its happening as we speak. People are bombing excavators, from what I hear in lots higher numbers than before, simply because there doesnt exist a counter. None of the things u present as solutions to that are applicable in reality, only in theory. 
---
Its not about risk, its about having no counter.
---
And considering you are talking about risk, whats the risk for bombers now? There really isnt any if they decloak and fire of bombs and warp off. 
---
Balance dude, balance. You cant just offset balance and say well in theory things can be done. All of those things are being done but they dont work.
---
how you going to placehold all the unsubs ? oh the 3x month promo and the sp for login ....nice way to make your "test"....
---
You should form a corporation of space knights which follows a strict chivalric code of honor.
---
Do roams where you fly around and rescue people who are outnumbered/outgunned. Attack only so-called "bad guys". Have strict rules regarding who you will and will not fight (ie, no attacking helpless Ventures, or no attacking pilots with positive standing unless they attack you first, or no attacking targets which you are absolutely certain to defeat, etc).
---
Would be nice if the devs stopped catering to the mega alliances, but throwing pvpers the bone of temp WH local for null, followed by delayed local via structures doesn't actually solve any problems, it just makes it easier to surprise someone. 
---
Well surprise, every vexor and his alt have a cyno fitted. Whatever.

While we are on the subject of Titans. Can we make dread do 500% more damage to Titans and Supers?

Yeah, that guy was so dumb .. pfftt!

Loosely inspired by real events:
---
-------------------------------------
---
The cockpits were dark and claustrophobic in the blank emptiness. The scouts lay in wait nearly twenty astronomic units from the nearest celestial, a small gas planet on the outer rim, wrapped in their cloaking devices while anxiously refreshing their directional scanners to find any hint of life out in the darkness. The minutes passed agonizingly slowly, yet no movement of hostiles appeared in the scan results.
---
Suddenly the silence was shattered by loud crackling broadcast over the comms system, quickly followed by a muffled voice. "Well, are we doing this?" asked a junior scout on the mission. "We've been here for five minutes, there's nothing on dscan. Let's light it up."
---
"Patience," retorted the squad commander. x3liteSniper420x had always been a little twitchy, and the commander didn't trust him to hold position until they could confirm that the coast was clear. He ran the directional scanner yet again, only to see the same blank results that had appeared on the fifty previous attempts. It looked like the coast was clear.
---
"I don't trust it," he said anyway. "They could be cloaked right next to us and we wouldn't know until they got tackle." 
---
Normally the commander wouldn't mind a good scrap. But this mission was different, four Nyx supercarrier class ships sat exposed in a neighboring star constellation, their fates resting in his hands. If the mission succeeded they would be silently inserted behind enemy lines, free to hunt the defenseless miners that made up the backbone of the enemy economy. But if the mission failed it would be a disaster that would reverberate across the galaxy.
---
"This is stupid," x3liteSniper420x griped over comms. "I wish local worked, this would go a lot faster." As much as he hated to admit it, the squad commander agreed with the little shit. Gone were the days when a brief scan of the star system would show every hostile craft in the area. Now they sat, anxiously watching for signs of a trap, with no clear indication of whether it was safe to proceed.
---
The squad commander didn't like the situation at all. It didn't feel right to him, but he knew that he couldn't keep his team in position forever. Making his decision, the commander reached over to transmit the all clear signal to the pilot carrying the cynosural field generator -- and was startled by an unexpected burst of static over comms. "I've got an idea," came x3liteSniper420x's voice. "Hang on."
---
Before he had time to react, the commander was shocked to see a notification that one of his stealth pilots had opened a connection to the local Fluid Router. "Wait--" he started to say, before the line of text flashed across his HUD, and all other HUDs in the system:
---
23:48 x3liteSniper420x: x up if urgaypwned
---
"Oh no..." he whispered, realizing that his squad's cover had been blown. But then, as quickly as the first, another message appeared on his HUD.
---
23:48 CmmdrZee: X
---
Then another message appeared, and another.
---
23:48 -notabot-: x
---
23:48 Morgoth: x
---
23:48 yiaxhi: x
---
23:48 cheetoz: xx
---
23:49 Timmy022: X
---
23:49 KrabKlaw1: X
---
23:49 FC_Steve-o: x
---
23:49 HaloNight: X
---
23:49 ScoobySnax: x
---
And on and on they continued, covering his small screen.
---
"Nope," the commander broadcast to the waiting Nyx pilots in a resigned voice, "coast is not clear. I repeat, coast is NOT clear. Moving on to the next option..."
---
So how the big bull blocs already use titans?
---
&gt; Please, for everyone's safety, do not attempt to operate heavy machinery.
---
Or if you do, please film it. I could use a laugh.
---
That sounds interesting. Maybe a corp that gives free protection as they wander about. Or a corp you can lease to gate camp for you.

So you know these botters? Youre friends, you talk everyday? Have you checked if bots in HS have become more or less? Or noticed an increase in explo bots?
---
Just because the VNI bots arent in space doesnt mean that botting went away. For all we know, they left for HS before this even began. Now, I dont have any insider information regarding this matter nor have I checked for bots in HS.
---
But its naive to think that in the age of alpha clones a botter wouldnt switch things up simply because of an event. I mean does that even make sense?
---
One thing I learned early about statistics mate is that you never stare yourself blind at numbers because they are just data, not conclusions. They dont really mean shit, ever, without proper looking into. You are just taking them at face value and basing your conclusions on something that utterly goes against human nature, namely if there is a will, there is a way.
---
Was there something specific that happened in 2013? I didnt keep up with things back then.
---
Good read, some great ideas!
---
There are several Caldari or Caldarish themed alliances. IRED, ARC and PNS are three of them. IRED has traditionally operated in Cal high and low and Syndicate at times. ARC are the lore nerds behind the Discourse YouTube videos and do all sorts of shenanigans involving Drifters and Triglavians and shit. PNS are probably the least overt Caldari or rp and are basically pvpers and mercs. 
---
As far as I know there are no or at least no large Caldari corporations that only take Caldari toons. Really the only Corp left that I know of that does that is PIE who only take Amarr toons and only fly Amarr ships.

I was talking from cavemen looking for food to ancient nomadic tribes looking for places to settle. Not even close to modern wars, and that shit happened everywhere for thousands of years.
---
Im going to come t the same thing I did on the original post
---
I haven't logged in for 3weeks now and I will not for next 2 at least. 
---
Its not becouse the blackout (irl stuff) , so I might not be the best one to say anything. 
---
I have lived in null for... I think 2 years.
---
 I like the idea but I think it's introduced awfully. How? It adds risk and some exicment but also stress and boring mashing d scan. 
---
We also have the drifters wichyou would need at least a cap to survive before the help arrives. It forces you to get a cap to rat which allows you to get the umbrella's help. new players in null now get butt fucked by hunters and drifters. 
---
And that's OK with me if the null is going to be elyte end game content, so yeah let's tell all the players that want those 40h battles nope until Idk 2 or 3 years omega plus a fuck ton of isk. 
---
If CCP wants to make null more dangerous and end game like then go ahead but most people that want to get into eve are joining becouse of those huge null battles.
---
By adding more risk you should add more isk we are now in wh like space with cynos gates and drifters ffs it's cheaper not to play atm just wait it out if there would be x2 or x1.5 loot, ore or bounties in while the drifter invasion... We would get more raters and miners thus more prey for the hunters
---
Im going to endure and adapt just like you,
---
I'm really happy that the game tries to get more playstyles as a legit option. 
---
But the original post was saying that reward to risk is now shifted to much more risk same reward.
---
Cynabal.
---
&gt; Fewer people PLEXing means lower PLEX prices which means a reduced incentive to purchase PLEX with cash. 
---
Which we agree with.  We do not agree how much this reduced incentive leads to decreased PLEX purchases.  From my experience, it means almost nothing.  You ignore the fact that without bots and mass multi-boxing there will be less Isk coming into the game, and prices will change.  This is where you go wrong.
---
You are changing one variable, ignoring everything else, and coming to a poor conclusion.  It isn't as simple as you think it is.
---
&gt; If that signal stays -3000 for any prolonged period of time, then PLEX will drop and fewer people will be willing to trade real money for a commodity which gives them a diminished return.
---
Sigh.  I am wasting my time.  Go think about how the decrease in ratting bounties flowing into the game is going to change the value of Isk compared to other things.  Think about the fact that ISK WILL GO FURTHER.  Yes, the nominal number of Isk someone gets for 500 PLEX can go down but the value of that Isk RELATIVE TO EVERYTHING ELSE can go up at the same time.
---
The fact that you think this is so simple says it all really.  You cannot ignore the change in the purchasing power of the Isk, and you do.  You will NEVER come up with the right conclusion.
---
People kept telling CCP that those changes would hurt. NS people. CCP didnt give a shit back then. Now theyve implemented another feature we dont want, we are telling them that and they are not giving a fk.
---
At this point, with the amount of fkups CCP has made over the last couple of years, it really doesnt matter what they want anymore. They should instead listen to the people and not reddit, to the CSM.
---
I dont have an issue with no local mind you, I have an issue with the current iteration.
---
having a second, third or twentieth account will not help you enjoy the game - it'll only help you to do certain things in the game better. If you are enjoying the game without multiboxing, awesome, I don't think the majority of players use more than one account at a time if they even have a 2nd account at all.
---
The advantages vary. If you are making money with some activity like ratting or mining, the more accounts you are working at once, the more isk you make. I think the only thing that makes multiboxing really necessary is when using capitals. If you aren't using capitals, blah, whatever. If you are then you need a cyno, regardless of any other reason for a 2nd character. You do NOT want to be dependent on others to move your capitals around.
---
The drawbacks are dependent on what your alts are for. If they are super specialized and you don't do those things anymore, the accounts are worthless. If they are really low level they may or may not be helpful at all. If you are using them to pvp you may need to bring extra ships with you.
---
For the fist 4-5 years I played this game I only had one account. My main and a 2nd character on that account for a max skill market trader. I haven't had my other alts very long at all.
---
It sounds like you may not play at all regardless of what we may say, and that's understandable. I hope that you give it a chance though and get what you want out of it. If what you want changes and you need additional accounts, get them! You'll only have more fun.
---
Yes pls üôè
---
I don't mean the transaction is a net loss, I mean the "redeem plex for game time" transaction is a loss. You're looking at it as a single transaction when really its two, the people who buy plex generally aren't the same as those who redeem it. By buying plex you're essentially loaning money to ccp in exchange for potential future game time which someone may ask for. There is no guarantee it will ever be redeemed and if it never gets redeemed (and ideally gets stockpiled and removed from the market) , it's free money for ccp.
---
They're also not just stockpiling that plex cash until someone redeems it, they're investing it and paying salaries and bills. If everyone plexed their accounts ccp would *make* no money and their balance sheet would be negative. They're not concerned about some loud mouth krab with their 40 accounts generating no income, they would be concerned about the majority who have been steadily and quietly moving on due to the uninteresting state of affairs.
---
Null is supposed to be dangerous. As the game has evolved, null isn't so unsafe anymore. This is a balance, nothing more.
---
1-3 is definitely Vee/Shadoo/Elo in that order.
---
Then 4-10 I think is a toss up depending on ones personal experience with a particular FC.
---
I am with you. But I dont think this will stop the machine, I only think it will just concentrate it more. And honestly, I dont think the machine cant be stopped, in general. This megaalliances are sitting on so much wealth and not just in isk but mats that it will take years for them to even be close to running dry.
---
My opinion is rather, break the machine by breaking the reason why these megaalliances even exist in their current form.

I joined Pandemic Horde recently and almost all I have done was on my main :) (will start doing more) but yeah, having a ton of fun with just one character. All PVP so far though. But at higher ends of gameplay you do need multiple accounts unless you want to always trust someone. It is mostly true when lighting cynos for ships though, faster and easier if you have an alt who can do it.

If a behaviour can be spotted, then its fucking spotted. If the change is large enough the assumptions can be made on the long term effects. Saying the behaviour, that is being spotted, as humbug becomes extremely ignorant.

But no one can say its definitive since its only been a couple of days. Theres just a high likelihood. And thats more than enough to set of warning bells.

I think of rorq mining as the thing you do when you're so good at the game that you don't mind "playing" a job simulator for a little while so you can play for free and PvP some.

After the tutorial do the career missions. The rookie chat is (mostly) superb, and the missions are (mostly) helpful and give a feeling of progression. Also, when you can't get a 7k shuttle in your cargo hold, ask in the rookie chat.

For the first time I've been able to hunt slowly, find a target, sneak up to it etc. With local the barges would have fled first thing.

Right now in NS, if we fight back then we are being meanies that defend our space. Boho they dropped supers on us when we tried to kill them. If we dont defend ourselves its, "ooh look at these krabbers, refusing to even fight back, CCP get rid of them all". We cant fking catch a break.

---
different target groups - most of the ppl with many accounts had them for mining. if they don't mine because they're not in rorqs in delve, they don't need those accounts subscribed. which, in turn, leads to less money for ccp. 
---
also, with less ppl buying plex and more ppl selling plex, the plex prices will deflate. coupled with some sales for other stuff like mct, your bang for the rl buck deflates even more, decreasing the incentive to spend money on the game. might even get worse if there'll be a noticable downtick in raw materials or finished products, or some marketeers speculate on that and increase the ship and module prices.
---
plexed accounts give ccp money, increase the prices for plex, decrease the prices of non-plex items, and are targets for pvp. i don't get why you dislike them so much. i also don't get your logic that an established steady income source is worse for ccp than a speculative influx of ppl dumping plex on the market to afford their pvp, which was the original point that i objected to
---
BACKGROUND:
---
I have to be honest with myself though, I‚Äôm probably not going to win, and even if I did I probably wouldn‚Äôt splurge so much on capitals ships, they‚Äôre too much work to keep safe, to much work to build, and they would draw too much attention. I‚Äôd probably spend the isk on funding my little roams into null sec. I plan (if I win) to start an open fleet where everyone brings smaller or even larger ships, where I would SRP up to a certain amount. Like a kitchen sink bomber bar.

&gt; Targettable station services that you can take down with 10-20 guys in a HAC/AF/inty/cruiser/BC kitchen sink fleet, depending on composition.

Disable their services multiple times per day over entire regions.
---
This used to exist, and literally nobody did it.  It's possible that, if you give it a damage cap, it might be workable, but it certainly isn't, otherwise: Either it has so little HP that any large warfleet will straight up alpha it because they're bored while camping, or it has enough HP to survive that and the only time anyone will shoot them are those same large fleets who are bored while camping and don't have other targets.

Buying plex does not equal loaning money. Plex end of the bargain may, in fact, disappear, be destroyed, be forgotten or lost. But the fiat currency that CCP have received for the plex purchase is not ever expected tk be returned, nor can it be retrieved in any way. It's CCP's now forever.
---
A situation where every single player would plex their accounts is impossible by design and thus is a useless, hypothetical scenario. If everyone plexed their accounts, there would not be sufficient amounts of plex on the market to supply everyone. The cheaper plex will be bought out and the price would rise, until either there would be no plex remaining at all or until the price would be so high, nobody would be motivated enough to pay that much ISK for it. In reality, though, if more people used isk, its demand would rise, price would rise, which would pique interest from suppliers to supply more. Plex is a self regulating economy.
---
A loud mouth krab who doesnt pay shit from a credit card and plexes 40 accounts is more than 4 times as valuable as a player who subs 10 accounts from his credit card, because he creates active demand for plex that may only be satisfied by someone paying money (more than per sub, mind you) to CCP. If there would be no suppliers, there would be no plexers and if there would be a vast army of plexers, they may only exist by the virtue and generosity of suppliers. Your scenario where everyone plexes is thus practically, logically and economically impossible.
---
If you still think that plexing does not bring money to CCP, you are so hopelessly stupid and useless, that I plead to you to consider removing yourself from the gene pool.

Inty scram is slightly longer range than non-bling webs (both heated of course), and significantly longer range than unbonused scrams.  In order to get caught by a Jaguar while doing a driveby the following things have to happen:

* The Jag has to have you locked - this seems trivial but if you're piloting properly and don't make it obvious you're immediately going to go for the driveby, many ramjag pilots will not have you locked when you go for the scram.

* The Jag has to anticipate your angle and correct for it - if the Jag doesn't, and you fuck up your distance and aren't around 11-13km (this is what you should be aiming for if you're t2 fit), you'll still coast out.  This is true even if you're not heating your mwd, though if you're concerned you should always heat at least that one cycle.
---
* You either have to come too close, or the Jag has to have bling where you do not - as mentioned earlier, if performed perfectly you outrange their tackle and there's no threat.  Yes, the window is tight, but that's inty piloting for you.
---
Now, having said all that, interceptor screening alone is not a solution.  Even stellar inty pilots can get overwhelmed by the sheer number of ramjags and projection ships in the meta.  You really need ships that can hit jags hard as they're coming in and make them either think twice about it or ADC early.  Stuff like jackdaw, cerb, etc.  Long range neuts and webs work wonders as well.
---
I remember my first months playing, it was a constant look for information about how to do things. It's up for today I still have to check wikis and tutorials. It's complex is a good way, not because it's badly designed\*
---
\*Some people may disagree
---
Short answer - no 
---
Long answer - noooooooooooooooooooo

I dont understand this meme I am a newb who just started , so there are wandering npc fleets?
---
I needed this. I appreciate this. I will learn from my mistakes. Upvoted.
---
Started two days ago after eyeballing and being intimidated by this game for 10+ years. Rookie Chat is my bff
---
Which are no good for fitted ships
---
Someone didn‚Äôt get the memo!
---
Dude, to think that your ignorance would get me riled up is laughable. I have been around long enough to see all kinds of stupid and yours is neither new or innovative. Its very meh but very much in line with this sub.
---
Your counters wont work because they are copy-pasted, not thought out. And its fairly easy to see that you dont live in NS or if you do havent used the ships Im talking about. Cause you are clueless and you wont learn because you dont want to. And thats why you never argue with stupid.
---
You‚Äôd be basically logging in for a fleet and hoping it‚Äôs completely SRP because there wouldn‚Äôt be much time left for isk making 
---
You could just do high sec missions that‚Äôd be the best use of time.
---
Good bait
---
Blackout did good job
---
" If the cloaky fleet wants to do anything at all they need to move arround so you can spot them." Looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool
---
This is good quality meme we both needed and deserved.
---
I always thought it would be fun to start a cult(in game of course).
---
&gt; Dscan is iterating through every ball (celestial, ship, drone, structure etc) in the systems simulation, and filtering out anything that is further than your max dscan range. It has next to nothing to do with grids.
---
This might be a stupid question, but do you cache the things that can't realistically move a meaningful amount unless the player enters warp? Celestials, structures, drones, wrecks, etc. That way you only calculate that distance once, and even could keep the different types of objects in different lists (dicts, whatever you use), so that you don't even have to iterate through them unless the situation has been marked as dirty (player entered warp).  
---
Also, for groups of objects (ships warping together, wrecks not on your grid, etc), could you just pick one and estimate that distance, and then proceed to ignore all the rest? I guess you'd need some kind of data structure that would keep track of these "groupings", and then the individual parts could message that they are now dirty and need to be removed from that group and considered their own entity? (e.g. a ship warping away from its fleet)  
---
Basically, for things that are grouped, either other players on the same grid, or things off grid that can't warp themselves, you can represent by a single entry in the data structure, and only have to move objects in and out of that state as they move (or you move).  
---
Also, since this is an exponential time problem, couldn't you allow for automatic pings when the number of players on the shard and in space are below some threshold, but once that threshold is reached, then come up with some gameplay reason why the "sensors are overloaded" or some such made up stuff, so then players have to go back to manually doing it?  
---
And what about something like a quad tree, where you can avoid doing any distance checks for objects that haven't entered warp (or been changed by the player entering warp), that you know are out of range?   
---
I really wish I could take a look at your code, because having worked on a different game written in python, where performance was a big concern, these are the kinds of problems I absolutely love poking at! :-)
---
Thank you for the tips
---
Having your own personal FAX pilot for keeping your big shiney alive is a plus for me.
---
Wow, first time I've clicked a pastebin on this sub and not been both gay and pwned.
---
i have been having some weird lag issues when right-clicking an item to open the menu while in stations over the past two weeks or so.   Never had it before.
---
&gt;What about specific US state corps
---
There's some country specific corps but no state-level ones I'm aware of. Other interest or identity concepts might work for you (aside from veterans corps, those are already around) but you may have a hard time scaling enough. 
---
It's not so much an issue of power projection as this game has been around for a long, long, long time and pretty much everything under the sun has been tried or is being tried. Every once in a while someone comes up with something out of the box or a better way to do something that didn't work before. It's not easy though, and it'll be even more difficult to bring your vision into a successful reality.
---
EVE can always use more RP corporations.
---
You'll want to keep your distance XD
---
Fair enough. The more content/value that real players receive in return for their time, the better off the game is as a whole.  The atmosphere in-fleet when we roam into NS is great as a hunter now - you don't know for sure what's out there ready to drop.  I hope NS alliances iterate with new defense fleets to protect their tasty krabs (since the ISK makes it worth it).  New content and increased risk/reward for all.
---
He isn‚Äôt gonna barely get thru denial in a couple hours
---
or perhaps because he is trolling  
---
There are 1000's for sale currently of both t1 and t2 in Jita.
---
Yes, literally complaining about no way to avoid getting blown up. No counter in a game based on counters. No skill, no isk, no SP, no knowledge will help you. Fk me for wanting the game to actually involve skill, which is the base of this game.
---
But that kinda is the story here. No brain, low skilled hunters want kills they couldnt get before because they didnt know how. The skilled ones arent really the ones sitting on reddit talking about how great it is because they always got kills.
---
you're surprisingly out of touch
---
They've been shooting Darkness for the past week(s)... This drawing is just ill-timed. Or maybe replace the eye with a bee?
---
Near2 is working just as it should at the moment. Did you try turning off your PC and turning it back on?
---
Eve is a game like no other. The more u put into it, the more u get back. But unlike others, you can keep skilling even when logged off. So keep ur omega going, keep the skill que full and you can enjoy only playing a few hrs a month. I have 4 bros that are military that do it. They play like 2 hrs a week. They build capitals in mass. Like 50 caps a week. The like market trading and got really good at it. Now they make about 5b a day and only log in a few hrs a week. 
---
It's all about the community your part of, I ur Corp.  And what alliance they are part of.
---
If you enjoy doing your own research by reading the forums, reading the Eve University wiki, watching YouTube videos, etc., you can really accelerate your knowledge of game mechanics.
---
The game can fluctuate between boring and heart-pounding. For me PvP is an absolute rush, even now that I've sort of gotten over the "oh God what the fuck is going on, why are all these screechy sounds happening, why is my ship a ball of fire" phase that comes with your first forays into PvP (and by first forays, I'd say that experience lasted for probably the first 100 or so fights I got into, perhaps?).
---
If that's not your cup of tea there's lots of other things to do in Eve, but the hard part when starting out is figuring out all the possible paths you can go down. The new player experience is limited and doesn't touch on many of the aspects of the game that define a lot of different playstyles and/or isk-making opportunities - wormholes, or planetary interactions, or market shenanigans, etc - so if you're lost or are having a hard time finding activities to dig your teeth into as a player, know that there are many options out there. Don't be afraid to lean heavily on the Rookie Chat text channel in game, find a player corporation, ask questions on r/Eve, the Eve forums, etc.
---
Also, and I cannot stress this enough, the very first thing you should do is ask, in the rookie help channel, assuming it's not already linked in its message of the day, about overviews and for a link to the Overview Listing channel, and then try any of those ones out. The default overview (HUD) when you're in space is awful, so the sooner you try different ones the better, because they provide much more information about your surroundings, and do so in a much clearer way. Seriously, ask about it before the tutorial voice finishes its first blurb.
---
I'll give ya the same story from a different perspective.
---
I mostly just rat in Impass, but for the blackout I decided I would be suicide tackle and was running an ares. While flying in my eggheadboy, I hear on coms "Hey so like how do I....a manticore just decloaked on me....he's lighting a cyno....TWO RAGS ON ME" followed by everyone yelling "PANICPANICPANIC."  Having only played Eve for about a year, I haven't gotten any titan kills. I mashed warp to go through and tackle it. Adrenaline pumping, palms sweaty and moms spaghetti, I warped to the xxx's in fleet. 
---
And there it was boys. Two rags trying to gtfo. In comes Shattered on coms to get the bigger ships online and doing their thing. I was taken shots. I was taken shots to the face like \[redacted to stay classy\] but I held on. Thankfully, the troops arrived rather quickly and I hear Shattered yell "GET SHIT ON." He melted extremely fast, and I was able to stay alive for all of it. 
---
And then followed the longest lasting battle of the day: the fight over who would get the fucking empty nestor that was left behind for some reason. Seriously, the arguing over who would take the nestor took longer than the rag kill. 
---
Honestly this whole blackout thing has been fun. Will it be permanent? I don't know. I'll keep tackling until I run out of isk.
---
That‚Äôs fine. I farmed the fuck out of them for him.
---
I'm referring specifically to the fact that you say having to mitigate the risks inherent to the supposedly most dangerous zones would be a chore not worth undertaking.
---
Alright I will!
---
what would be a better iteration then?
---
missing the point
---
Boohoo. Die in a fire (in game)
---
That's how it works - or do you try to tell me that a hunter is 100% focused every second he is in space? It may be a telefone call, a delivery service ringing, the microwave pings, there are thousands of possibilities why someone is caught. A small fault is enough, and these faults not only happen to miners or ratters.
---
What you wanna have is catch people that don't make faults. This is sealclubbing.
---
There's a lot of roleplay corps across New Eden. I know Provibloc has some Amarr RP corps in null, Ursha Khan does Minmatar RP in Fac War, there's many others as well.
---
yes, they so based
---
Content fort - 9b

Watching Elo retreat back thru 8 cyno jammed systems past a dozen other tapi content structures to dock up and log off..... PRICELESS
---
With the change over to 64 bit, I have been experiencing problems with module activation, docking and jumping, general stuttering during running invasions. While it does look good, I am dreading my first ship loss appeal to CCP due to failure for a module to activate, delayed response from game, etc. Damn logs always seem to show nothing..
---
I don't know for the OP, but for my case, I use both.
---
Google(doc ?)sheet is really slow and don't offer a real control of when retrieve external data (at least, not without heavy scripting). I use it for low critical and/or shared EVE stuff.
---
Excel is fast and I can update external data when I really want, by a single button. I use it so for heavy EVE stuff.
---
It's from the cloud.
---
Thanks sweetie
---
I too, enjoy Eve because it gets me in the mood to wash my SSRI's down with whisky.
---
Ok powersv lol
---
Ah, in that case carry on trolling :)  Honestly I probably wouldn't have bothered with your comment if it hadn't been in response to Falcon because today I've just been rocking out to his vision of eve.
---
(Psst lip service...  it‚Äôs a blow job reference in the thread of dick puns... don‚Äôt make me /r/wooooosh you....)
---
Man, what an attitude.
---
My bet is you're a virgin. What age, no one knows.
---
Thanks, still worth it since I needed to renew today anyways.
---
I finally trained into a leshak with a high sec alt the other week and ran some L4's to try it out. I actually had more fun with it than the regular missile/drone or rail boats. 
---
Considering putting a skin on it too, it's animations are very well done, I love how it folds out as the disintegrator spools up.
---
Confirmed. At least I acknowledge I'm an asshole. Off your high horse cunt.
---
&gt; I think its time they hired a military historian to help them implement a more fluid, modern type of warfare in their game, instead of the current stagnation. 
---
THIS would be incredible and benefit the game greatly! On a sad note though, I think they fired all their economists (or at least that's what I heard last). CCP could benefit from both.
---
It's called "seeding", which is a mechanic for "strategy". You put many battle ships in there over a period of days \o/
---
Appreciate the writeup, it was easily the best time I've had in a long while. Props to RR for finally catching me lol.
---
Hi, I need a sugar daddy!
---
With the addition of asset safety and citadels, outside of wormhole space, there is very little asset risk beyond dying in space. Back in the day it was possible to get locked out of all your assets indefinitely but with that removed casual play is a lot more common outside of hisec than it used to be. Due to passive skill training being the largest gate to most ships as long as you have skills training there isn't much of a downside to being afk.
---
Nothing of value is lost EM is so 2009 the meta now is all about thermal.
---
Well, there is a key combo that shows your input log and time it takes for the server to process it. Not sure what it is.
---
But also, remember the game functions on a 1 sec tick. So things only happen every 1 second.
---
Spanish Inquisition fit.
---
This isn't a good post.
---
I'm making a corp (just for me and my alts) where we nomad through j-space, living out of an orca, hunting people and shooting sleepers.

cuz ur gay pwjnd

Same tbh

I have been in tears laughing at this post! This is right on my level unfortunately
---
'Damn, glad I brought my drake.'

I was putting eggs on to boil while this went down. What a fuck up
---
While this back and forth has been amusing, you've ignored every point made.  Have fun flying with stabs while they're still a part of the game friendo
---
Story/AAR?
---
Well the overall player count is down. Hmmmmm thonking. Maybe it's because thousands of bots are not logging in
---
1 exhumer and 6 rorquals is doing wrong with blackout. I saw several people mining away with a new setup that's basically cancer to anything but a small gang.
---
Stream sniping is lame

TLDR: NOVAC fed

Why do nn linemembers make these posts?
---
Ability to divide your hangar and cargo hold would be glorious.
---
What‚Äôs a tank?
---
Story time: MCAV was nano skirmishing with NOVAC's HAM Drake Navy/Basi fleet in the system between us. A few kills happened. TDSIN came in with Osprey Navys. They lost a few and ran. NOVAC decided they wanted to end the fight and went to the WH in their home with 3 Nags. MCAV jumps in to get a last few kills. As we leave a LASERHAWKS sabre lands and bubbles their 3 Nags. 4 way fight ensues. LASERHAWKS brings in dreads. NOVAC brings in a Vehement and more dreads. Lots of dreads die. Once the Vehement dies everyone loots and bails. gfs all!
---
Okay
---
Game to actually involve skill? Local requires literally zero skill..."oh look +1 local dock up" how is that skill man?
---
Skill is scouting, patroling, guards on the gates, literally the same thing I have said for I don't know how man posts. However you decided get all "your stupid"..."no brain"..."I am the best no one can damage me"..."I am top alpha never blown up".  
---
Come on man be less the angry gamer nerd stereotype, it is tired my man.
---
in their defense, they were getting 3V1ed. Had LH not rolled in once their dreads were already engaged by TDSIN/MCAV they probably woulda just mopped the floor up.
---
That looks like a glorious brawl
---
Sad I missed this.
---
You took a vacation day for a content fort? Jeepers
---
1) NVACA Connected to our static. We fuck around in shuriken, we aren't able to form a proper heavy armor comp due to numbers and instead shit talk eachother in local.
---
2) While keeping eyes in NVACA we see MCAV start poking around. NVACA with kitey bullshit, so we third party
---
3) NVACA and MVAC start escalating to a proper doctrine ships, we continue to third party
---
4) MVAC rekts NVACA so they take 3 naglfars towards MCAV
---
5) Lazerhawks direct connects to NVACA and starts throwing sabres at the nags
---
And well.. after this is all pretty much in the BR. They bring some phoenixes and a Vehement, we tried blapping some of the subcap subbort from NVACA but it's kind of useless since there's nothing to actually rep since most of the subcap support was gone.
---
NO ME, I NEED ONE MORE
---
We're sitting at 17k online right now. Thats normal for this time of day

Apart from mixing up power creep with infaltiib this is a good post
---
Nice reply. 
---
Some of the things I read on this sub, specifically the non NS people and their thoughts on what a nullseccer is... I dont have the an appropriate word for it. It reminds me of rascism irl, how certain myths revolving "lesser" groups keep thriving even tho most of it lacks basis and no explanation can change the other sides mind.
---
Every comment made is almost always entirely based on being a 50 alt multiboxing Rorq living in Delve. Every solution is towards that, every anger, every thought. Yet, Ive only seen like 1 one of those. Not saying they dont exist, but they are not the norm. Most are exactly like you, like me and the rest of us. Enjoying certain things and disliking others, but we went into it knowing (somewhat) the rules.
---
Our knowledge and skill mattered. 
---
No local, imo, has radically changed that principle of Eve and in doing so changed the entire picture. Thinking there wont be long term consequenses is very naive and since NS wars created headlines and not the solo roamer, this effect will hurt the game.
---
But it is what it is and we will adapt, maybe that adaption puts us closer to the door, maybe not. One thing I do know however is that people will regret it once they realise the price that was paid. By then it will be too late and many who left wont ever come back, leaving the game in an even worse state that it currently is in.
---
I just hope they have the balls and the brains to say they were wrong at that point, which I doubt tho.

Can't win with a shit ton of logi, so might as well bring dreads

GF nocav, lazerhawks is still retards

Will get you some free skill points (used to pilot ships)

Or you could just take over the existing ones in NPC 0.0 with your group.

I like how the post saying he wasn't afk got more upvotes than the person who actually fucked up, forgot to refit AND lost the proty...... i guess nobody will ever know :)
---
Tanking does not mean tank
---
every fight in wspace has always not had local.
---
except when CCP's chat server is fucked then wspace gets local :D
---
&gt; shuriken
---
When you literally copy/paste the aar from your corps discord complete with corp doctrine names that no one else is going to know what they mean.
---
90% of the charm of Power Metal is the absurd campness of it all.
---
delayed local then vni nerf, mining and ship production nerf, ore transportaion nerf, and keeping nerf nerf nerf
---
TL;DR - Everyone's statics connected, NOVAC got caught in the middle of a foursome.
---
On one of my alts, when I undock, by the time the environment loads the undock timer has about 4 seconds left and I'm the only one on grid. Thankfully I'm tethered. In an NPC station I'd be screwed and everything would load just in time for me to see my ship blow up.
---
Yet another myth being spouted as bs. You guys really need to get your narratives straight. Are NS people afkers or a are they paying attention. Because you cant have both. And a lot of those are bots you stupid mongrel.
---
And all those irrelevant things u said can easily be dodged. Which is why they are irrelevant. Can you get your head out of your ass and realise that there are bigger groups out there than your shitty small gang?
---
I never said any of that, nor did I implied it. Thats projection. I have more isk and SP than I can spend so nothing you do will hurt me. You are really daft and riddled with koolaid. Most people in NS will gladly spend isk to get a fight, since we have it in abundance. And we dont mind getting blown up since we dont really care about our KBs. These are issues for the "elite".
---
So I reiterate, nothing you can do in this game will hurt me. Nothing you can say on this sub will hurt me. I just feel bad for the ones that it does affect.
---
But that wouldnt matter to you.
---
It's pretty obvious you were paying absolutely no attention until the point where you warped off  :D dam cap batteries :D
---
This fight was hours ago, is that the best spin TAPI could come with? It does sound like Vily need more Milky Ways...
---
gotta whore that karma
---
Eve is such a cock tease
---
I know, just sayin'.  WH fights are the best fights.
---
I‚Äôve been winning at EVE since my daughter was born a few years ago, but just resubbed all 3 accounts to dick around for a while now that shit has been stirred up.
---
it's literally my AAR (doxxed myself)
---
That‚Äôs... that‚Äôs a thing, I guess.
---
How does no local have anything to do with this?
---
would catch attempts to drop a cyno inhib in smaller systems.
