Good one. Excellent post. Please continue making this community great.

---
Okay then, I might apply on the next days, I just want to be an ammo pimp, making virtual money just for the fun of it.
---
Well, because when it's over, people write stories and talk about it for years.  The map changes, alliances fold, people quit, other people start playing, it becomes something bigger then just you.
---

---
You get a good gank, and no one even notices.
---
Some of us play eve for the narrative.  To be a part of a story.
---
Other people don't, and I get that. I don't really go out of my way to shit on those people.
---
None of that changes the fact that gate camping is right there with rorq mining on the fun scale.
---
&gt; I am working towards building a nice war chest to do just this
---
stop right there, that's the main logical trap nerds get into when thinking about doing this stuff, you will NEVER have a nice enough war chest because inertia is a hell of a drug.
---
Well... in my case its not Drekavics.... "Fc, can I bring my Leshak? Oh, and btw? Will there be SRP for it? Its expensive" -&gt; Awoxed before fleet left the system.
---
Your absolutely right, a good C3 to krab isn't particularly easy to find but in my experience when you do find them you can easily pull 2-3billion out of it. Then you might find another good C3 anywhere from a few days to a week later and do the same. 
---
Definitely not isk making on the levels of super ratting or dreads in C5s but for less hardcore players it's absolutely some of the more lucrative isk to be made. 
---
I gotta say: Goooood Point! But let me tell you the following:
---
I couldn't disagree more, if you want to compare it to something mundane I'd say faction spawn hunting going through asteroid belts is the most comparable and mundane thing. You don't sit in one place, you're moving back and forth a lot, reshipping or baiting.
---
And we are apart of a narrative but nothing like what the big null secs have no doubt but to us we are a disrupting force in the assemblence of control that an alliance or big group has on an area. Genuine space terrorism essentially and we identify with that more than anything. 
---
The thought of empire building would crush my small corp overnight honestly, that said, everything is subjective, not saying you have to live our lifestyle, this is just what and how we do things and I thought I'd share for people who wanted to pvp and not need to PVE constantly.  We also don't use caps what so ever and don't give content to hot droppers. If someone comes with a real subcap fleet, we always would reship and take the fight. 
---
&gt; Ill have two rorqs on grid in a few days.
---
&gt; if I had a decent amount of ISK to fall back on
---
like, 90% of the small gang nerds i've flown with barely have enough to afford 2 rorqs hulls if at all, let alone inject/train 2 rorq toons and get the fittings. Just sell that shit and extract the rorq skills and you're set for a **long** time without any isk making.
---

Unfortunately true. I'm so glad I got away from being a "fc", it basically just meant feeding kills to the idiots I led.

Leaving them and surrounding myself with people who can make things happen too was the best move I ever made. When will the "line member" realize that more people trying to create content = more content for all.

---
Greed outweighs passion :(
---
Good Point! But let me tell you the following.
---
I actually am in a bigger nullsec Alliance (+3000 members)/Corp (+300members). My Corp has had not a single FC left this winter, and i was bored to hell, crabbin around all day long.
---
So I started doin PvP on my own. Reached out to some of those NPSI-Fleets to learn a bit more about PvP, have a look for different strategies on different encounters. And hey, I became better and better. Soon, some of my corpmates got to know about my activity in PvP, and wanted someone they know, to lead them into PvP. So here I am, playing the game for 1 year now, FCing Cruiser/Bc fleets roaming through New Eden, leading capital ships into home defense, etc. The good part of beeing in an alliance/corp that big is, I still have easy access to a lot of isk, with a low risk, so i can still afford to loose a lot of ships in the process of learning EvE-PvP. Tbh, I've thought about joining one of those middle sized wh-groups, but now, that I've seen, what we can do, hell, ain't gonna change that so fast. You gotta remind, I'm still learning, and there is still a whole lot to learn. Just yolod a fleet by mistake, but I will know better next time. There might be the day, sooner or later, that I will feel the need of a change, but not now. 
---
You sound like you're potentially at risk of polluting the human gene pool. I would recommend offing yourself in an incredibly painful way before that happens. Think of all the future humans as of yet unborn. Please don't pollute their genome.
---
One of my stints in EVE was leading a corp of about 15 active people. We took on an "industrial" alliance of about 800. We ended up killing them by the truckload, taking some of their space, and forcing them to join up with a blue donut group. 
---
10/10 would do again. 
---
Yeah, artists. Go balance the game!

---
what did CP do wrong :O
---
Press a button to do 80~k damage to a grid regardless of range, given that grid would cut off around 200km because the game could hardly handle 2 people on the same node
---
 YEah they use asic miners these days 
---
just adapt and become a virgin again tbh

It's the new skins probably

I had more fun in Exodus and HTP doing small gang than i've ever had in eve

You made my day!!
---
Landed at Aunenen gate and noticed that a citadel was being reinforced yet there were no pirates or players on grid. Zoomed in at noticed Caldari Navy Police shooting a citadel.
---
Didn't know NPC's beyond pirates had the capability of doing this. Corporation which owns the citadels has negative standings perhaps?
---
&gt; Mobile Medium Warp Disruptor. Buy them, always keep 2-3 ready. Do you know of a large groups pipeline of traffic? Do you know that every day from 0100-0300 this group has OPS in a neibhoring region? Im willing to bet a handful of their mouth breathing linemembers are always late to fleet. This is your time.

&gt; Found a group in your timezone that has WAY too much space for a 200 man alliance? (lmao 32 held systems, in 3 regions) Fit up an entosis and hit all their 1 adm system, watch as they scramble daily to try and stop you. Watch Local fill with hatred and bigotry.

Can you be permabanned from a Reddit post?
---
look man just read the title of the post...
---
If you‚Äôre doing it in t1 frigs the response fleet will consist of bored interceptor pilots, and maybe a meme carrier. 
---
And they can't even blame this one on "but muh art devs doing game design/coding!"
---
No, this is literally the art devs' job. 
---
The only person holding you back from truly enjoying EVE online is yourself.
---
I was getting kinda bored so you know what I did? Started feeding dreads and carriers to GOTG in an attempt to learn how to dread bomb and hunt. I wasted 8 years of my EVE career depending on others to find content for me only to discover I could generate all the content I needed by myself.
---
After rambling non-stop about how only if I had a few others to join in, ‚Äòstrategically feeding‚Äô capitals to illustrate enemy response, and putting in some effort into scouting, I finally got a few friends to join me (ooedalls and Zungens). 
---
It grew a little bit, picking up some here and some there, before long we were nuking supers and rorquals. Then we became competent, Asher came on up and saw how comfortable the couch was. He had a few extra friends come with him and we had a merry time. 
---
This was hands down the best time I have ever had in EVE - the skirmishes, hunting, PROPOGANDA, competitive jawing at the other team, kills and change from the norm in doing something different, and even the scouting and study of enemy forces / logistics. I am pretty sure everyone who was in **ROIR** had some of their best EVE Online experiences there.
---
Then it snowballed and we accidentally 4-5 keepstars or something and got all Dekleins faction fortizars and the fun was over... but definitely super entertaining while it lasted!
---

the appropiate term is tard wrangler

Imagine how huge a middle finger it would be to the playerbase for CCP to just straight rip off this idea.
---
https://hoboleaks.space/
---
Probably. Loved flying with you all though. Always a good time seeing you rile someone up in chat
---
Flying with Simple Farmers is the most fun I have ever had in EVE in the 10+ years I have played this game.  We have no FC's, everyone knows what the fuck they are doing.  It is so refreshing being able to recognize the voices of all our pilots, know who their alts are and be able to coordinate without the constant XXX in fleet chat.
---
Maybe they shot them using the citadel guns? 
---
The bubbles are to create attrition in a group. "Man the FC doesnt even help if i am falling behind"
---
Its just that you dont really get a sense of ‚Äúall scales of pvp‚Äù when visiting you guys :)

You dont hope for vni‚Äôs.. you hope for a response/fight.. vnis is just what you often end up with.
---
Ha. Yeah the red ones.
---
What gila's are you flying in T5 space? Cheapest ive seen is avg 1-2b thats a carrier..
---
Yeah!!! Fuck sov!!! Local is primary!!!
---
I'm not sure citadel spam is going to as effective for a massive alliance as it is for a small alliance.  I feel that it is far less disruptive for us to constantly move to another citadel than it would be for Test for example.  I have a Jump Freighter and a Bowhead with all my assets stored in freight containers.  A move takes me less than 20 minutes.  
---
Back when BRAVE lost ge-8 in to PL in 2014, we bled so many people moving to another station.  It felt silly giving up the entire region because we lost 2 stations when we had another 20+ stations we could move to.  
---
Upholed
---
Basilisk, not Obelisk 
---
Tiericide was linked to several efforts by various CCP dev teams to make the game friendlier to new players (such as the new tutorial, the ship tree, etc, leading up to Ascension). It was sold as a way of removing needless complexity from the game and to make the game's naming of mods more consistent and therefore easier for newer players to understand.
---
All of those efforts to bring in new players were dropped around the same time, and tiericide got caught up in that drop. So I doubt CCP will ever get around to it.
---
Then why does everyone run away when a ping for cormorants goes out? At most we get a 30 second engagement and trade a few corms for one or two of their ships, and then it‚Äôs over unless we get a dictor bubble or someone tackled something in a really tanky assault frig. 
---
But they are busy making skins 
---
Oof
---
I did not say it is empty. maybe one or two will defend and use the base weapon.
---
Just do it!
---
I seriously can't understand why it's such a point of contention for everyone? I personally love the new icons, and think the old ones are jarring and distracting by comparison. I don't need my stuff color-coded. I can see what the buttons are just fine without it. I prefer a UI that blends into the background, and is as easy to forget as possible. I play with full transparency through my windows and enjoy having the actual game behind the spreadsheets being as much of the screen as possible. 
---
I never missclick anything on the new UI, my only complaint about it is how easy it is to mess up your icon order by accidentally dragging one to a new location. I just wish it had a "lock neocomm" function that prevents you from moving things until unlocked, like the taskbar of windows.
---
But then again, I'm also a supercap pilot with no alts who uses the radial menu. In other words, a dirty heretic. 
---
It does indeed stack up. Got 300 mil in my loot container just from an evening of station camping in my nado. Semi-afk watching shows on Netflix in the late hours of the night. You've given me some good ideas, thanks dude.
---
Do you still lose your shit when someone brings the wrong bomb? ;)
---
Nothing stops me from making peoples lives miserable as a member of a large alliance. I pretty much have spent a majority of my time in eve making people turbo buttmad. 
---
There‚Äôs a radial menu?
---
Avatar may be a better choice...

Cheers buddy, needed a good giggle tonight.

---
You would have a lot of penises in space. 
---
I didn't specify the issues as "bugs" per se, but here's the short list of most pressing issues currently:  
---
1. The  Schr√∂dinger's local/chat
---
2. Rubberbanding/disconnects/markets not working (this wasn't an issue or at least wasn't as bad when there were 40-45k people online months ago), especially in abyssal space that's a death sentence and completely nullifies the entire idea of those sites if you are not just working to completing/overcoming the randomized spawns etc but also rolling the dice on whether you would get "socket closed" or not
---
3. Launcher fuckups, new launcher coming soon, and I have little hope for it. Most likely will just end up as the 1st point and be the same as local - barely functioning.
---
I believe that's an AC-1003, not 103.
---
Honestly the game was more enjoyable back with slowcats.  You didn't need to pay any attention so you could shoot the shit in fleet chat and have a ton of fun.
---
CCP too busy with corporate suicide to finish tiericide lmfao!
---
I hope you find joy and peace in your life. 
---
God damn it walley stop posting like this I dont want to like you!  Good post bud and good luck in all you do.
---
maybe they're motivated by something other than "literally everyone in the world likes me"
---
betcha didn't think of that, did you raisinbrain
---
Send him the 'cinematic' footage from UALX, Asakai, X47, B-R, etc and he can get an idea.
---
It's only natural. Some folks around here have had their shortcomings made brought into a sharper relief than they'd prefer. Lacking the agency to actually handle their issues, they choose to lash out.
---
Ok I do miss fcing bomber fleets, that was fun. 
---
lmao they really did seed the dreads
---
Ive been trying to start a casual pvp for profit and fun corp but nobody wants to join 3 members with the plethora of corps and all the freebies that have to offer. Love the idea, refuse to stop trying, but its looking grim.
---
because they could easily let people choose button icons
---
 but the art team is busy making skins that they sel for 30 bucks a pop, so that's far more valuable 
---
That is correct! That's my fault! I will get that edited! Thanks for the correction!
---
rise and fozzie are still there lol
---
Well, I guess you proved his point.

---
That's now been corrected. Thanks for spotting that!
---
I mean, I get what you‚Äôre saying, but how often do our corm responses outnumber them 2:1 or even 3:1 sometimes. I would run as well. What I wish we would sometimes do is get a ping saying ‚Äú10 man kitchen sink fleet in O-V/LX, need 9 to give them a good fight‚Äù 
---
Lets be real, no 10/15/20 man gang are looking to take down Horde. They‚Äôre just looking for some fights. If we gave them more small gang fights more would come imo.
---
But again, dass just my opinion. Small gang is more fun for me than just F1ing
---
Yeah, did this. Tried big alliance, small alliance, lowsec, nullsec, it just wasn't doing it for me. For myself, I blame putting rorquals on grid, and I say that as a miner. The whole economics of the game went out of whack, and I found myself shopping around for a titan and feeling like they just don't have the specialness they once had. Mining isn't fun anymore, you *have* to have a rorqual to make any decent isk. So I put several of my miners into rorquals, and an activity that was once chill became stressful, as it takes significant time to make back the investment for each rorqual bought.
---
Sure, citadels introduced the shittiest type of ops where you dedicate hours to nothing happening. My alliance got tired of the blue donut bullshit around these things and decided to cut our ties and go small and independent, only to find everywhere you go in nullsec it's blue donuts as far as the eye could see. We picked a spot with good alliance diversity, figuring we could carve out a system or two for ourselves. But nope, turned out they were all part of a blue donut of their own. Citadels are center pieces for the crappiest ops, and at the same time allow for crazy force projection. Force projection and plummeting super prices meant it's super easy to react to entosising. I always nay-sayed the nay-sayers for each patch telling CCP "You're runining EVE!" Well, it happened. I still have my accounts, but I've removed the renewals for them all. I'll come back from time, but I won't resub with money until it's fun again.
---
no its ok
---
YEah they use asic miners these days
---
no
---
[removed]
---
just so fucking buff dude, no big deal
---
Really? You think driving new players away is going to *help* the game?
---
Its a rough patch for sure
---
Yeah, I'm definitely not saying that it's required, I'm saying that it's a good idea to have an alt account running.  The 5 accounts reference was a glib quip, nothing serious.
---
Is Project Discovery still actively scientifically valuable? Or have we crunched through the data set?
---
He wants to send the khanid skins to the back of the hangar.
---
wow you sound boring
---
They minmil and thus blue to smile and wave I'd guess...
---
It's just a way to introduce players into buying skins
---
Why would they all decloak off-grid then
---
&gt;when you do find them you can easily pull 1-3billion out of it
---
That would mean there are 25-75 sites in it, as you describe them? 
---
&gt; I prefer a UI that blends into the background, and is as easy to forget as possible
---
you can't make this shit up
---
Ohhhhh juicy, 'grabs popcorn'
---
Jumping a hole?
---
Being in a big alliance doesnt mean you cant have the small/medium corp feel.
---
There are plenty of close knit corps in TEST that do thier own thing when not on TEST strat ops. SPVG etc,
---
Shit like this is why my subs are lapsing to alpha.
---
It was a good run I guess.
---
Since I think you are referencing *normal* level 5's - PvE in a carrier in lowsec isn't the safest thing, without a bunch of other dudes already hanging out in the area for backup
---
Me as well
---
If you're not having fun with what you are doing, I'd say quit, and find something fun. Tons of fun stuff to do with 35 mil sp, while you train up an alt for some months
---
Fly frigs, learn a bunch. I got *good* losing 1mil fit frigs, all the way to the facing off against PL in the AT, back in the day
---
It's a gif, not a picture, you silly boy.
---
I see 2bil regular holes maybe twice a month and shattered c3s can easily be 3 bil if you have the capability to picket/roll unfavorable holes. Granted it's extremely rare to find those I just noted 3bil cuz it's possible. Heck factor in possible data/relic site can loot and a 1bil hole could be a 2bil hole if Bob shines his luck upon you.
---
It's pretty easy to find C3s with 10-20 runnable sites if you are willing to spend an afternoon rolling for a good krabhole. Suck em up and roll for more until ur bored or have other things to do. 
---
Then i guess you're pretty new. It was all over the forums for a couple years as they were rebalancing modules. Lots of feedback was provided and stats given to the players about what they were doing. It was a great time in the game's history, as it felt like CCP was actively listening to the community and adjusting things as needed. You should really go back into the old forum archives to catch up, especially considering you're part of the CSM..
---
Congratulations for showing your ignorance.
---
EVE is so nuch more interesting beyond the big alliances and pvp.
---
Don't buy skins, sell your plex and get REAL benefits 
---
I don't get why some people on r/eve hate the radial menu.
---
It's much quicker for a lot of things once you get used to it.
---
I mean, we all know you got elected as a meme and not because of your game knowledge, but that's some pretty basic stuff.

Nod. I live in standing fleet. Not one for small gangs. So if someones troll-entosising low ADM structures, I'll definitely go and check it out. Every. Single. Time.
---
It's funny, but they assume standing response fleet will get tired of responding, but that's the job. Some of us are good at it and love doing it. Every. Day.

Good luck on your search my dude! 
---
Just gonna say that you're gonna need voice comms for all major alliances. The good thing is you don't have to speak, just listen to the fleet commanders orders and you should be good.
---
However, if you're wanting to learn pvp in a smaller environment, like a mentor/mentee thing, talking is pretty much required for efficient communication. It just takes forever to type shit, because everything in this game is complicated. So voice is the go to.
---
Also, Karmafleet is recruiting.

Start two more characters on new accounts right now if you are really interested. Trust me you‚Äôll thank me later. 
---
u can be a carebear in a small group, 30 man corps need supers too and somebody's gotta build em, as far as learning PvP everybody ever will give you the same advice, fit a shit ton of frigates, Look at them like ammo, disposable cheap single use, and fly them into faction warfare lowsec over and over picking whatever fights u can get.

You have anything to back up these claims? Cause I am not buying any of this. 
---
Is T3s much different? Could they be run with the same ship to learn the ropes or? I've heard T3s are harder than T4s is that true? I'm spooked by T1s right now so idk where to start.

If you literally just started and have only invested a couple hours so far I would remake your account with a [recruit a friend link](https://www.eveonline.com/signup/?invc=8d8bfe0c-1f77-402b-aa18-5ce51c6b587c). If you do you'll get 250,000 bonus skill points for your character to start with that you can assign to any skills you want.  
---
Feel free to ask any other questions you may have below, happy to help out
---
Thanks! Hit me up! Tiark Ohu!

Goons and TEST both got some sort of FC training program and alliance level SRP (alliance pay for the fleet srp, not from your personal wallet) but I'm pretty sure for both group to get into the FC program you'll be needing some sort of vouch.  
---
also to be a fc you should be building relationship with people first, you'll be having a hard time to get people in fleet if nobody knows you. (and you're not getting that vouch if nobody knows you too)
---
 imo personal charismatic plays a big part for being a fc, if people likes you they will join your fleet even if its welp after welp
---
He's an irrelevant shitlerite who oh so desperately wants to become relevant. Pog.
---
Wouldn't the cool way of doing it be to titan rat on a goon character in geminate?
---
This message brought to you by asic miners. 
---
Recently realized that I mostly just krab with my rorquals to pay for their subs - I didnt know this, but the frigate abyssal sites easily supply enough isk to keep you subbed for that account in a matter of 4-6 hours.
---
There is no one in the game that is interested in your best interest unless it is somehow tied to their best interest... NOONE! Don‚Äôt ever forget that fact and you will be ahead of the average newbro.
---
Which race you choose is a strictly cosmetic choice, there is nothing one race can do that others can‚Äôt, that is all determined with how you choose to train. Consider looking into a Corp that will provide you with a minimum recommended skills training plan, or look at one online. Eve University wiki used to have some good information on training plans and many other items of interest, not sure if any of it is out of date.
---
Welcome to Eve, it is an amazing game that truly allows you to choose your own path. There is so much beauty and wonder to behold in New Eden and I‚Äôm envious of you for just beginning that journey with fresh eyes. I hope you enjoy the game as much as I have over the years!

Oh, and avoid the double your isk scams in local chat... They won‚Äôt really double your isk, they‚Äôll just laugh at you after you send it to them, lol... Fly Safe o7

They're different but significantly easier. I recommend you use this fit on SiSi and play with the mechanics a bit then move on to the T4 also on SiSi until you've done like 30 or so without dying. There's a curve, but don't freak yourself out over it. It's not hard once you get used to the spawns and know what to spot.  :) Good luck and feel free to message me here or on discord @Moderninferno#8853
---
A sensible/objective analysis with good suggestions and there‚Äôs not a single current CSM in sight. Go figure.
---
but only if it doesn't apply to them
---
This is good.
---
Now THIS is krabbing.
---
Those balls to stream titan rat with 600 Titans behind.
---
EVE supports multi-boxing - i.e. having multiple accounts logged-in at once. It's great for double/triple the PvE income, or if you want to get crazy and have multiple ships in a PvP situation at once.
---
I've got 3 Omega accounts and a couple spare alphas around just in case I want to add another. 
---
Envyjames is right though - it's not a dumb idea to create on or two more Alpha accounts and just keep the skill-queues full of useful skills. (Start here: https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/The_Magic_14) 
---
I think wally was being sarcastic in this situation. 
---
So fucking pointless. The pve game is completely figured out yet this mechanic only makes ganking much much harder. Someone mentioned the other day that a warp disruptor will guarantee aggro on you. I wonder if that‚Äôs what causes all npcs to switch even if it‚Äôs another player ship. 
---
welcome to eve equipment 2 years ago
---
The OP post is really speaking to me. I think I thought of Null like how I thought of it seven odd years ago when I last seriously played (was probably wrong then too). It's just not what I expected and I'm not really interested in the massive fleet battle numbers rule and my Alliance treats Cap pilots like gods while anyone who can't/doesn't want to is scum and killboard is king (they are more interested in making it look good than actually being good). It's just not me.
---
I have however really wanted to get into/try abyss sites, they sound awesome but I get confused. From what I read they are solo instances? But people say you will die unless there's three of you. I'm not sure what's correct and they sound too scary to go in without being prepared. 
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main_Page is your friend
---
Oh wow! Didn‚Äôt even know you could do that
---
But what if you are the apex force in eve...and you can create havoc where ever you want while CCPs stupid choices in "game balance" have lead you to a fountain of wealth where SRP is nothing more than a small Delve Time Unit yet they refuse to admit Rorquals were a mistake and patch them?
---
That‚Äôs literally the opposite of his point. 
---
I think most wh corp will give the authority to use base weapen to all the members. At least, my crop gives.
---
You get your entities split and fight one another
---
The two extra characters on your main account are great for passive isk making like planitary production. Or leave one in Jita as a market alt to buy new ships to welp. 
---
I think Envy's suggestion was to start 2 or 3 alpha accounts training general skills as a head start for the future. In 6 months if you find yourself enjoying blops drops, train one into a hunter so you have something to do besides staring at the bridging battleship. If you think you may want a shiny carrier one day, start an alpha now training drone skills. As you get deeper in the game and find playstyles that interest you, your alpha accounts might cut the training time from 6 months down to two. Plus they are free.
---
I‚Äôll keep this in mind. 
---
In your eyes, what would you say you wish you did more of as someone just starting this game?
---
Very cool!
---
Yeah it's great if it's a BC or larger. But most nano gangs, the fights over, salvaged, and pod killed before you even land on grid.
---
In the end, you gotta decide what's more important. Getting on killmails or keeping your effeciency % high.
---
Holy shit that is amazing
---
Tbh I'd be down for that. Bring back Fatal Ascension!
---
It's ironic how the game is marketed as being a game where you can do anything in this MMO and be anything, but most people choose to just be mindless drones for an alliance.
---
What is this finish thing you talking about willis?
---
I know the feeling. I still kinda miss my old home in Orduin...
---
THAT IS MY GNESIS BITCH YOU BETTA BACK THE FUCK UP UR RORQUAL.
---
They are ambiguous, I mistake icons almost daily since they were introduced. That didn't happen with the former ones.
---
most corps in test are nice to be in, with the exception being spvg and sf. They tend to be a bit too toxic for my liking.
---
For me? Definitely training into stealthy ships... That‚Äôs how I enjoy the game, whether hunting in a stealth bomber, or exploring and hacking in an exploration frig... I‚Äôve been on grid with capitols in null systems that had no idea I was there... I‚Äôve had whole gate camps flying in every direction trying to decloak me when I jumped into their trap... I‚Äôve entered through the unguarded back door of some of the largest null and wormhole alliances to participate in non-consensual PVP with their PVE members mining or ratting... 
---
I started with the up front, in your face brawling method of PVP and found it fun at first, but swiftly got bored with it... Truth be told, I never was very good at it... But stalking my prey from the shadows, slow boating up to them as they hack that last can in the relic site, thinking they‚Äôre home free... The reactions are often priceless... When I get tired of hunting for targets, I can always hop into a cheap exploration frog and play the mouse hacking those same relic sites, praying I don‚Äôt get dropped on by some stealthy hunter... It never gets boring for me!
---
As I said in my original post though, you truly can play how you like; there are literally hundreds of things you can do in this game... You need to find the one that best suits your play style and train to specialize in that...
---
You should have gone like

'Comet me bro, comet me'

---
you realize that is the point for the entosis trolls too though?
---
You get a group of response fleet guys usually in random ships and you get a nice fight.
---
But that's not really RPing because it's in a distant alternate universe future. I don't think ISIS or the Islamic state would be in that world. It would be named something else anyways. Why don't you RP with like real terrorist words as an "ancient language". Plus not all terrorists are Islam. Look at some of the other crazy terrorist psychos and cults. Japan/USA/Mexico/Africa

lived in provi for years, had lots of rules in my corp i didnt care for but i spent most my time recruiting new players, loved doing the whole 'teaching and introduction' thing. way i saw it, eve is known for a steep learning curve so anything i can do to help - if i helped just a couple players over the years not quit the game out of frustration then i was playing it right.
---
cant do just one thing though. provi was open, i loved fleeting with random deference fleets or some other alliances fleet on the other side of provi and get involved in a hot drop. being able to fly with different people who had differing syles and views and yet were all working towards the same end goal... it was nice.
---
now ive moved after hte war ended, living in a nbsi null sector where its just dull. always see the same people, always fight the same people OR you just sit inside your own pocket doing your own thing... dont get me wrong, i like having a semi safe place to just carrier rat or mine or chill but i also like roaming pvp.  it seem politics all too often kills fights before they start

I'm perfectly happy not being in charge of the fleet. I've done time as FC. It's not my thing. I like logi though. Never had problem getting in a fleet "FC I can fly all races T2 Frig and Cruiser logi.." FC: "YUSSSS"
---
Would have been awesome
---
If I thought of doing that
---
But I don't Haiku
---
Be advised that there are corps (such as THERAPY) that specialize in actively bubble camping Thera connections - especially the HS ones closest to trade hubs (they can‚Äôt camp everything). Typically, they will have a bubble, shitloads of T1 drones to decloak, insta-lock ships and high alpha. 
---
Newer, guileless explorers will certainly explore holes near trade hubs and newbie systems. Noobs are unlikely to explore off of Thera, which is typically the province of more experienced explorers.
---
There are really two schools of thought on explorer hunting: 1) splash a hole near a trade hub, scan everything down, and wait; 2) just dive. In the latter category, the theory is the more holes you splash, the better your odds of finding content. 
---
I prefer the latter strategy, especially in a Stratios  or T3, both of which have a broader engagement profile than just explorers.
---
Astero is an awesome ship. Have fun!
---
You got three options to salvage this: delete this comment and hope everyone forgets (we won't), admit your mistake and reee so hard about teiricide to ccp that you get kicked from the CSM (we won't believe you), or ignore this and hopes it goes away (it won't).

But I'm happy being in a large, multi timezone alliance. I work shift hours, in Australia. I need a large group as I'm online all over the place. 
---
  The last time I tried a small leet pvp group, most of the time I'd be the only one online, because it was 9am on a weekday. 
---
  Like all things in eve, some styles of gameplay suit some people. Not everyone wants to solo/fly in 5 man nano kitey gangs all day. Not everyone likes pvp. 
---
  Just remember, eve is a sandbox. I've chosen to fly for a large alliance. The comradery. The united goal of a large, well oiled machine. The large space operas and being part of a major war is why I play this game.

I knew what the old ones looked like and could quickly press the right button. Now I just press a hotkey to open the window because it takes me time to find the right one looking at the icons.  Probably a minor annoyance at best but it's something.

Ccp did part of the items. There was a roadmap in the office years ago, but it seems quiet now around it. The idea was that stats and names would make more sense too new players. Also balancing atoryline , faction, t1 and meta items. Now faction gear is below t2 soemtimes, and some meta stuff is pretty cool. Its a bit of a puzzle. Some would argue its what makes eve eve, others say it s a needless bump for new players. 
---
I'm picturing you as the annoying childhood friend of eve,
---
Krab battle!
---
Absolutely beautiful.
---
It's a good sentiment, but would probably feed quite a bit. Maybe with the right FC though. 
---
Yeah fuck this. By the time I burned out the thought of even logging in at all, even for the express purpose of having fun, shooting blues, or nearly anything of that nature, had become a total chore.
---
I don't find small gang or solo play fun or engaging at all. I never have, I never will, and believe me I created a fuckload of chaos in my heyday.
---
There is a time when you will legit just not care.
---
There's only one who can get me to log on, only one who can bend me to his will, and he does not share power!
---
Wally was part of feign they made a living as a small group fighting entosis battles.  He does know what he is talking about. This strategy isn't viable against groups that have a high population density i.e. goons. But it most certainly works against medium sized groups that hold large swaths of sov.
---
&gt; I **need** more than one account?
---
No, but you **may** have more than one.
---
Actually I'd recommend to ignore this particular advice, the game is already complicated for beginner. Just play as you like, you'll know when you'll need more accounts, **if** you'll ever need them.
---
Prints will be available of the painting if anyone if interested, message me. 
---
T4s are the minimum for ‚Äúmaking enough isk to be worthwhile‚Äù. The drop tables between T3 and T4 are pretty unfavorable. Every tier up is harder than the next but there‚Äôs a significant jump from 3 to 4 and 4 to five compared to 1 through 3.
---
T1s should be able to be done in basically any ship with decent skills 
---
Give the Stratios the ability to carry an expanded probe launcher. OK if it is only Sisters Expanded probe launcher (lore) and therefore you pay a cost penalty. It‚Äôs ridiculous the Strat can‚Äôt combat scan shit.
---
Give the Nestor a covops cloaking ability - make it the only battleship in the game that can. Yeah, it would be OP - so what. It would be fun as shit. You could gimp its ability to spider tank or cap chain if the cloak is fit, so it is strictly a big-ass drone boat in that scenario.
---
It's not a good idea to put all your alts in one Alliance. I understand the attraction in terms of making ISK (sov null PVE is pretty sweet), but as you point out, when you're in a major Alliance sometimes you just can't undock those alts. Then, you're not just losing ISK generation, but you're bored and feel like you can't even play the game. 
---
The solution I've found is diversification. Take at least one of your alts out of the Alliance and put them in your own tax haven corp. Depending on their skills, set them up in faction warfare or L4 missions or incursions or abyssals or exploration or even piracy. I've got alts with jump clones set so that they can be doing any number of these activities, whenever. It doesn't matter if I log in thinking I'm going to do X and X turns out not to be available, if I can immediately pivot to doing Y.
---
This is also a good strategy for your long-term survival in the game. No Alliance rules forever. It's a good idea to have something going for yourself that isn't dependent on the Alliance for when the Alliance is no longer dependable.
---
250,000k skillpoints is ~10 days of training for alpha account, give or take.

Also, this guy would get rewards.

Hmm I dont think this fit would survive a heavy neut encounter, like several starving vedmaks/leshaks or drifter battleship with neut cruisers
---
yes people get 20+ rorquals to boost each other
---
they were brave enough
---
very old flair but okey
---
Only thing I really really dislike is people telling me when where and how I can use any ship that I own. Unless the alliance paid for it they can fuck off. If I bought or built  a ship, i shouldn't be punished for doing what I want with it. I both hate and love squizz for what he did.

if you play few hours per week, dont waste them on isk making. Have some fun instead.

---
New players often join one of the newbro corps - Eve University, Pandemic Horde, TEST, Brave, just to name a few - because, yes, nearly everything in EVE requires being part of a group, especially if you want to PVP. These Alliances will often take you by the hand and teach you lots of useful stuff and help you skill up and give you some juicy sov null space to farm for ISK, etc. There are some drawbacks to membership, but it's not a bad way to learn the game.
---
However! There are lots of player communities in EVE which do not require joining a corp/alliance. You can participate in faction warfare, in Bombers Bar, in incursions, in EVE Scout, you can dive into missions or industry or market trading, you can salvage with Pro Synergy or get into hauling with PushX, you can buy some cheap Thrashers and try some piracy, there's really a lot of options for solo or semi-solo play. All of these require some skills and knowledge about the game, but there's nothing that says you can't develop those outside of an alliance.
---
can you try googling a "screenshot"
---
yes, if you do ANYTHING alone, you'll want a scout, or a salvager, or a hauler, or a Cyno to jump to, one to scan things down for you.   
---
I started 6 years ago thinking I would do it all on one character. How wrong I was. I wish I had started multiple characters at the same time.

---
You guys are missing my point. I know what Tiericide is. My point is that nobody has done anything about it in years, and nobody talks about it anymore. 
---
This was literally a thing 5 years ago. That might as well be another millenia as far as CCP development time goes.  
---
You guys completely missed the point of what I was saying. 
---
Oh man, a hybrid choice. Option 3 with a little bit of "it's just a prank, bro"
---
My point went over everybody heads.  
---
Nobody talks about Tiericide except reddit. It's not a thing internally anymore. Balance is basically one person these days. 
---
Serious question

I am stuck on a gate in my Nyx, trying to get to Rens to sell my data site loot. Anyone have any ideas how to sell loot?

Just to add, how about becoming a "liberation front" or "freedom fighters", rping with some sort of utterly bat-shit insane ideology which you take incredibly seriously?

Just eject the ceptor in your hold, eject from nyx (nobody will take it), hop in your ceptor, travel to rens. Profit. 
---
Still happens. We were shooting an athanor with jackdaws about two weeks ago-ish. Fleet warped in. We saw them on Dscan but couldn't see them visually, even though everything we were looking at said they were RIGHT THERE on grid with us. we burned away from the athanor expecting... something. it just felt wrong. well as we burned away from the athanor, \*poof\*! The caracal fleet appeared in our face. We turned and burned again, away from them, and they disappeared. This happened a couple times, til we decided to fuck off and call it a day. 
---
Screenshot taken. Probably make some sort of shitpost about it tomorrow
---
I'm not going to say "lol I was trolling" - I'm going to say what I said - nobody outside of reddit talks about Tiericide anymore because it hasn't been a thing for a long, long time. It's just a random thing reddit brings up every six months.

Then there's the blops that both have a bad scan res and still get a penalty for fitting a cloak despite it being their main thing...

There are spawns it cannot handle, but the drifter BS with like 5 dissipators and 3 or 4 webs I've survived but like by a hair. Its not meant to do everything, but it's at a cheap enough price to be able to lose without losing a 1b pod and 1b ship, yaknow? I've lost like 3 in 200 sites, but my main has good skills for it, and I know how to pilot. It takes a quite a bit of mechanics knowledge but definitely possible. I tried to do my best explaining that in the article. :)

---
Adding to this, the leshaks are easy imo. Just primary them, they usually are in structure when they spawn. The only issue I've had with them is when they spawn with camps but even then I've never died to that spawn
---
I did, but that has never despawned the site before. I always kill that and the mother drone. I've done sites after that one despawn and they've been working as expected ever since.

This is wrong, the Federation is composed of heathens and the Minmatar slaves.

When I started FC‚Äôing in Darkness, I began by taking out caracal and osprey fleets. They started as 8 man caracal fleets. Then within a year I had begun taking out 250 man cerb fleets during WWB. I got to FC is some prettt large battles. It was good fun before I realized...sort is sort. 
---
My advice, have fun. Don‚Äôt just ‚Äúping‚Äù for a fleet. A lot of this advice has been technical. That will come. Don‚Äôt worry. If you care about success that knowledge will be learned. However, the desire to continue to content create ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt just come.‚Äù Don‚Äôt just ping for a fleet. Create a social group around your fleets. I grew an entire SIG in Gotg called ‚ÄúSuper Best friends.‚Äù It grew big enough that Sort and the IT team made me a discord channela nd teamspeak tag etc (this was before World War Bee when ‚ÄúSIG‚Äôs‚Äù were not the same). The fleets and group kept growing because everyone was being social and having fun. So again, don‚Äôt just ping for F1 warriors. Create a group of consistent friends.  Corps or alliances don‚Äôt matter. The social aspect will lead to you wanting to continue to content create! 
---
TLDR; don‚Äôt just look for mouth breathers. fly your fleets with at least a consistent core of people. Will make it fun. Make you better. Gg.

---
Small groups may work well for you, but I never found them particularly enjoyable. the game got so much more enjoyable for me once I finally got over my alliance aversion and joined up with one of the big ones to "try it out".  
---
Just about any type of content I want, I can have for the asking. if I want to solo roam, well I could do that anywhere. if I want to do small gang roam with a close knit group of pilots I'll just ping my corp and see who's available. exactly same as in a small pvp group like you describe, except if due to timezone or whatever I can't get enough people, I can then ping some of the other corps in the alliance to fill out the numbers. making it more likely the roam will actually happen.  
---
If I want to do massive fleet fights with hundreds of carriers, well that content is available on a regular basis as well. feel like mining, rorquals abound, feel like ratting I can bust out my super. Want to do some blackops behind the line shit. there are groups I could join up with that do that as well.  
---
if small corp content works for you, thats great. but personally I've never had more freedom to do whatever the hell I felt like doing than since I joined a large alliance.
---
Would curtail docking games perhaps...hmmm
---
Feel free - I‚Äôm not going to change what I wrote just because some dumbasses didn‚Äôt understand my point.

Ahhh yes, the age old argument that tries to compare a highly complicated balancing pass that could require months if not years of development time and a large team of programmers to complete, and despite being an improvement is unlikely to make the company any money directly. which is somehow directly comparable to a ship skin, that probably took one guy a week or two at most and directly earns the company money. totally the same thing! lets just switch those graphics artists over to the balance pass team and hope they know WTF they are doing. after all, painting pretty space ships is totally the same as balancing an entire games worth of modules.

Panther: 194mm, 126mm w/ cal navy cloak
---
Sin: 175mm, 114mm with cal navy cloak
---
Redeemer: 213mm, 138mm w/ cal navy cloak
---
Widow:  144mm, 93mm w/ cal navy cloak
---
They have great base scan res, but the cloak does put it back to where most battleships sit with relation to their t1/navy ships..
---
Obviously the scan res will improve with better cloaks, but figured the cal navy is a good average.
---
BLOPs would do well to see a significant hike to their scan res though. Since theyre ambush ships. Kinda goes against their role to ve slow at locking after fitting the cloak that helps them in their role.

Shut up retard.

I started the game in similar way to where you are now. Pocket, ratting, same faces, same enemies, sometimes fight, sometimes krab. I learned a lot, and didn't really get rich because I was keen on fighting, but over time I became more and more interested in the PVP side of the game.
---
I've not really done much bearing, I always dabble in new things, and sometimes find ways to make a bit here and there, but I've never been... 'without', and you can make money without carriers or pockets. You find you adapt really quick, and if you enjoy something like training, pvp, camping, whatever, you'll always find a way to sustain your playstyle.
---
I think worst thing you can do is sit stagnant, maybe just try to join NPSI gangs that post on reddit/discord/slack, or just start affiliating with random crews. It's fun, different, and the feeling you need a safety net (or home), is... not true. Just own your game and change it up to make it fun. 
---
The sandbox isn't fun when you've dug down to bedrock. Move to a new patch!
---
I was happy in my alliance. Problem was that the whole shebang was being held together by one man. Inevitably, he burnt out and joined PL, thus the place fell apart. The only remaining nullsec players are enemies of old, lowsec was full of enemies of new, and I don't enjoy wormholes. Nowhere I wanted to go, I flew with Spectre for a while then eventually stopped logging in.
---
2006 was just battleships with 425mm rails and 1400mms for days. Everyone sat there lagged out, targeting enemies and waiting for their F1-F8 rack to light up, and hopefully someone else would die. Sometimes you'd just be there, then you'd be in station. You didn't see anything happen, or your ship die, it was just a transition.
---
Slowcats was just an evolution of that, but is just easy-mode FTL in space, sector 1. Better off running 6/10s for that action.
---
The game is a lot better now. Really.
---
I feel like this could be a great copy pasta. 
---
Has the exploration relic sites been nerfed? Lately I'm finding more empty cans and less than a mil worth cans. The overall payout from site hasn't really dropped much but it seems there are less 'average' cans and more 'bad' cans. 
---
Dual scram astero is definitely a thing (4 points worth of scram).  Don't be greedy, drop off your loop when you can, you will get hunted down by someone in something cloaky, especially if you go to WH space.
---
That hasn't worked for player retention and has forced too many small groups not to grow inti larger content providers due to abuse of the system.
---
Ditto, and agree with OP.  
---
If fit and flown well you can do at least 1s no question.
---
Weird Ishtar fit
---
Yeah. Either of those works, honestly I would prefer the removal of siren, dromi
---
What happened to the balance team that was supposed to make incremental changes to ships and modules more often than in the past?
---
Just a quick question about strategy in a t4. I was doing pretty good with a passive gila in a gamma, I think it was 4 Republic Fleet extenders, a fed navy AB and then a t2 hardener for the mid slots, and the rest were the obvious. 
---
However, I ran into a wave with several neuting triglavians, I think in Leshaks, and then two striking leshaks. I primaried the neuting ones, but they got me dry before they died, and then the leshaks killed me. 
---
In a situation like that, what is the best option to try to survive? Should I turn on my hardener or AB first, since going with both at once causes me to just run dry again. 
---
My home. I do live in a wh but I still have my death clone in x-7, that sippery tengu exploring there is me. 
---
&gt;but aside from that, if it's just chat **or excav recalling - i say play on!... what harm can come.**
---
Oh...so recalling all of your Drones on 10+ characters at the exact same time isn't considered a gameplay advantage now? Right....

Have a downvote. Here is why. 
---
The community screams ccp isnt doing enough to prevent botters...  truth is Team security is doing their job as fast as they can. They ban thousands per month throughout the month. They post about this regularly.
---
Input broadcasting is 30day ban and is under investigation as confirmed by the request from falcon to submit a report ingame. 
---
Eves Dev team is easily the most approachable and available dev team currently working a major game. You might not feel that way but as someone that has talked with a number of Devs and communicates regularly with the CSM I feel more than ever connected to the game, the community and the Dev staff.

I started my own Corp a few years ago and recently invited a few of my friends to join. I know them personally and share ideas about what to do with our time. I have not enjoyed EVE this much since starting the game in 2013. 
---
No pressure to commit any time to any activity.
---
I found that the decisions made in big corporations where usually only discussed by VIP members. These decisions ended up ruinning the game for me. 
---
Being an FC and wanting to work for your content are not mutually inclusive. There are plenty of ways to go out and do things as a group of people without needing the typical f1 anchor, and being an FC is not the only way to lead.
---
Not 0 risk but it's close.... I'll chalk this up to "they hate us cause they ain't us"
---
Given wormholes a thought? Plenty of good corps who enjoy roaming for content who don't need dedicated fcs OK to play the game 
---
Interestingly I use radial broadcast menu, but right click or shortcuts for general piloting 
---
An Interceptor Propulsion Module. I like it. The Assault frigs have the ADC, the Interceptors would have the IPM.
---
Or maybe I like to be part of the conversation, and genuinely enjoy engaging in the community... 
---
Welp i tried it, couldn't even damage the first guys that were there and died.

Really I'm just trying to get a blood raider titan spawn so I can say I killed one... though fountain is nice too

No.

New content &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Old content.
---
Having new Combat focused T2 Trig ships in the game could solve a lot of issues and they need to be implimented ASAP. The old stuff can be just left to die out. No need to waste time and resources on it trying to fix it. Just phase it out and delete / replace with new stuff.

that would be coming from sex implorer in my scenario. it's when she wants the relic, but with the t2 she told you not to worry about.

How do player bounties work?

Eh historically speaking the Americans didn't invent hit and run tactics like this. European armies already used this tactics prior. 18th century warfare requires line shooting to break formations. Because you don't win by creating casualties as much as you do by breaking formations. That's why even Washington moved the military toward conventional formations as well. The US was getting whooped up and down the continent until a conventional force was substantial enough to challenge the British as well as the French getting involved. But yeah the hit and run tactics were useful as well. But this myth that "the American frontier minute man beat those dumb Red Coats who just stood in line to get shot lololol" is nonsensical.
---
Make him a capital pilot üòÇüòÇ
---
The real question is, how doe sthe antimatter tech of Eve work? Technically, when matter and antimatter meet, they cancel each other out right? So consider each antimatter round has its antimatter in a suspended state until target impact. How should this actually affect energy shielding? and once past the shields, each shot would literally delete chunks of your ship, right?
---
I am an F1 monkey. I freely admit that because I work in a stressful job in management and frankly don't want to do the same in eve.
---
However to your question about what would happen if I wasn't on a fleet I can give examples:
---
Ualx - I was a fax pilot in the first wave. We *just* saved titans a couple of times when they were primary. Without me, that titan would probably have died
---
Provi (can't remember the system) - we jumped in supers to PL/NC, they counter bombed, I was in first wave of fax again, first titan died cause people didn't react, second titan bled heavily into armour and he held at low armour cause the first wave faxes overheated. Again, if I wasn't there he would have died
---
War against Frat (1lk1 I think), I was in the first dread wing - hostiles committed carriers, me and 70 or so dreads were ordered to jump on ~50 carriers, hostiles counter dropped and we ended up in a 0 dread brawl. Me being there allowed the other dread wing to drop on the hostile reinforcement carriers 200km away and forced the frat fc to split their forces/decision.
---
So whilst it may not interest you, it does interest vast swathes of the community and alot of us get enjoyment/satisfaction from being part of a bigger whole. Additionally 1 pilot not being in a fleet *can* actually make a difference between breaking a target or not, fighting or not.
---
Did you check with me before posting? I don‚Äôt think so.

Karmafleet is part of goonswarm which is part of the imperium. They have the best infrastructure in the game currently, which means you will have access to some free ships and skill books. 
---
Karmafleet has tens of thousands of people in it so no matter what you want to do there will be a group of people willing to show you the ropes
---
You can make quite a bit of money if you ask in a ratting system if you can salvage the ship wrecks that people leave behind, 99% of the time people will be happy to help a new bro out. 
---
We all recognize that the more people that play eve the better the game is so almost everyone will be nice and help a new player out.
---
I'll send you a pm on here with my character name so if you need some help or to ask questions in game (believe me it's a steep learning curve) I'll hopefully be able to help.

You get 20% of the ship's value or 20% of the pod value from their bounty pool.

I've been flying with Stig for about a year and a half now and have heard a lot of stories of his early days with Richie. It was an absolute pleasure to finally meet him and take part in this really amazing kill!
---
Its hard in the beginning to even get a basic notion of pvp in Eve Online. What broke it up for me was to watch one or two videos from solo pvpers and understand what is going on and what your options are. I can recommend this video from CCP Rises early days as kil2: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SobBykOcLLI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SobBykOcLLI) This will give you a notion of how to move from gate to gate using the aggression mechanics in your favor. Thats what i simply do most of time with my fleet: "Be the drake or hunt the drake". From there you can go into kiting and whatever tactics.

I honestly don't know what they were thinking when they designed the NSA module,  but Battleships can rig for subcontrollers for more scan res, all they need to do is cheapen the material costs of the t1 and t2 rig and make them more affordable to players.
---
As long as your corp ceo is a reference to Che Guevera (or even maybe Yasser Arafat) this sounds like a great idea

Something that always pissed me off about the game is how awesome looking kitchen-sink fleets looked but how **fucking totally USELESS** they are at actually getting anything done.

Well the player logged in count is at 2007 levels without accounting for the fact that people have alot more alts these days, so seems fair.
---
'Mouth breathing F1 pusher' Your argument went from interesting to 0 in this comment. The fact people are looked down on because they get a few hours a week to log in and take part in a fleet is quite frankly pathetic.

Victory in war comes from making the opponent not want to fight it anymore.  Everything else - morale, resources, personnel, memes on Reddit - is foreplay.  That is Basic Military Strategy.

The American Indians lost in the end, almost everywhere.  The Brits lost some of the Colonies due to the French more than guerilla war, plus the fact that many Americans have no idea that Britain was fighting both the rebellion and France due to the [Treaty of Alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Alliance_(1778)) Spain joined in to have a go, so while those skirmishes were happening in the colonies, there was a planned invasion of the UK, a siege of Gibraltar, invasions of UK territory across the world from India to South America.
---
The war ended at Yorktown, where it wasn't plucky farmers raiding from the forests, but the addition of 9,000 Frenchmen and a fleet of French warships outnumbering the British forces 2 to 1.
---
Ironically, the new USA sat out the later French/British war, didn't create the trade wealth the alliance treaty suggested and France ended up severely weakened for it.

Don't suppose you'd link your fit would you? I'm very interested in what you're using. Also, do you only do Gammas or does it work with other filaments?

Actually CCP is doing a lot ... but not what players desire.           
---
Remember that 250 people is not 250 people that code - but also whole management, legal, finance, hr ... and even people in the cantina they have in the office or cleanup crew.        
---
250 people is not a lot tbh - at work i am sitting near a department that have 242 people (all doing one thing)  and they all 'fit' in 3 'open space blocks'
---
 yeah the point is that ccp moves at a snail's pace with literally everything they do even if it's steps backwards

i guess they must have half their staff dedicated to ship relocations and ship replacements

Well kind of - if you look at the running costs they are also down - or should i say you can have now much more for the same price.

The infamous injectors ... check daily trades on extractors, check monthy volume for them, then include the fact that any sane person will not go and buy extractor from market but get a package directly from store, same for injectors - like i never sold one on the market - always contracts.

---
The only comment has -14 points.......well now I have to check it out.
---
salvaging behind a super is 120mish hour, its not the most creative activity but, you can do it enough to buy 2 or 3 injectors and some ships. You can use gilas for everything missions up to level 4's, ratting same anoms you would do with a vni, wh sites, pvp. Like I said you should socially interact with your corp, so to get better help. Mining gas with 1 venture can be from 30 to 150m/hour in raw gas, depending on where you live (assuming its null)

Nothing 1shots a upwell structure, they all have damage caps, making them 10+ minute grinds, even if you bring a full fleet.

So how come this 'Absolute' Injection Augmentor  are still consumable after being expired? Expired accels dont have this property.

It works if you you can timezone tank them, we (CENTI) did it nearly a year ago against a USTZ group while we were EUTZ. We were able to rat and mine in our timezone (we didn't have many ratters/miners though)

You know I feel like a LS gate would be amazing?
---
With everything being as expensive as it is and the immense boredom of earning ISK, whether it's mining or PvE, is it really that hard to believe players will choose the easier option.

So are you serious about the leaving the corp part first before causing chaos, or are you basically asking everybody to start awoxing each other?

OK somebody said for (1) it was an Amazon issue.  That I can believe.  The screw-up here was a failure in QA testing I think.  On (2) again I rarely have problems with it and when I have had problems, they've been fixed fairly rapidly.  I can't say I've had a single issue in the last 3 months.

You describe big alliances as boring and shitty and anything else bad there's in the game.
---
In those alliances I made history, I was part of the WWB on both sides, I lived the M-O siege and the biggest fight in the game (since then), I lived the Judgment Day on my skin, I was part of the blitz in Rage a I was among those who destroyed Fort Knocks.
---
That's Eve history man, these are events which will be remembered since the last day of this game and maybe more.
---
And I'm not one of those veteran FC with hundreds of billions in the wallet, titans and assets all over the game, I'm a regular grunt who started playing just 4 years ago and immediately went to null and wanna be part of something bigger than me and bigger than a shitty 5 men gang camping some useless regional gate...

I'm not saying that for you, if you like small gang chaotic gameplay please continue. I'm saying that for new players, if you wanna be part of the history of this game, you know where to go.

Do you like slavery? I hope so because Amarr are really into slavery as a concept. And religion. Pretty intensely, actually. So really you're an extremist slavery evangelist. As long as you're ok with that Amarr is right for you!
---
 eh /o\            
---
So please tell me from where those extractors came?         
---
Did they drop somewhere or maybe they are reward from some event or agent?               
---
From what i know they can be only obtained from CCP store using PLEX.           
---
From what i know this plex also can be only obtained from CCP but this time for $$ at quite in favorable rates.         
---
So if my knowledge is correct the only way to spawn extractors in-game is using $$ paid directly to CCP account.           
---
That's nice dear.
---
Lmao I was spitting coffee out of my ass all over my keyboard! My sides are in orbit! You made my year!
---
YEah, they just use asic miners now, makes sense 
---
The F1 pushers are there because of the way large fleets work. There is a person leading them, he/she gives the orders which the members follow without quesion and the majority of the time between those orders there's silence (obviously there's command channels etc. but in general, from a grunt's perspective, there's nothing going on). If are out of line (you jump early, you warp late, you anchor incorrectly, missclick etc.) it is very possible that you will die and as the fleets are boring very quickly, your concentration drops and you fuck up and ... go out of line. You can be a very good and experienced pilot and be totally shit in big fleets. As a honest opinion, I believe a new player, flying his first big fleets, will pay much more attention and therefore will be significantly less probable to die straggling on a gate or misaligned.

I think from player to player you have the option to notify the other dude. For corp and alliance I'm not sure, never did it.
---
*A wild police conet fleet appeared!*
---
You can also get plex from ccp by blowing up their ships!
---
GODDAMIT VALADOR, NOW I KNOW WHY YOU HAVE FORSAKEN ME!
---
The reason is two fold. You form 3-4 times the numbers of the attack group, and you specific use cormorants which is pretty much cancer for any smaller group since your engagement range is around 100-110 km, while smaller gangs often are setup to fight within or just outside of point range 20-50km. Combining the huge engagement range, the ability to maneuver around the field keeping the fleet at range with the huge dps output you get with the size of the fleet, simply makes most gangs unable to engage. Also even if you tackle and kill ships they will cost next to nothing comparing to losing one of your own, often many times more expensive ships.   
---
Cormorants are really really good and often a really smart doctrine for you guys to use when the fight is about controlling or winning a grid for an objective, but it just isn't fun to fight outnumbered against.  
---
I hope it makes sense :)
---
If you care to check, CCP employees in events can only utilize PLEX that was already bought - but was for example confiscated (?or destroyed with player ships?)
---
This is a beautiful thing &lt;3

If you really want to you can contract out prctically all non essential jobs, which is what I'm wondering has happened.  Support personnel don't have to an actual ccp employees.

yeah but like

why
---
Thing is, CCP has no reason to listen to the community as long as enough people buy skins, and unfortunately enough people do, so good luck with hoping for anything to change, except perhaps for the number of items in the NES  store
---
Funny thing is, the only clue CCP would probably get from this post is that their next set of skins should be priced at 690 plex...
---
Holy wall of text batman
---
Thank you, yes. But I would personally be reluctant to bring any mention of real life politics into the game. Its too restricting. Far better make up some pants-on-head-wearing ideology so utterly unreasonable, so immensely hypocritical, that it would cause maximum offense to anyone normal. Yesss.
---
I've got quite a few questions actually. I'm considering giving eve another try after not playing for a while.
---
Is there a good alternative to Lutris/playonlinux to run it on Linux (I'm on Ubuntu 18.10)? 
---
I'd like to go into pvp quite fast. What faction provides the best starting ships to do so?
---
Should I join faction warfare for early pvp?
---
Thanks in advance o7
---
bruh i wish youd bring those kikis to test. 
---
I know, but main office is on Iceland - my (probably wrong) assumption is that not all non essential jobs will be outsourced to the local companies - due to CCP 'age', local population and bit different culture.   
---
The whole Iceland population is around medium sized city and you can kind of leave doors open there when you go out shopping.             
---
Its always the the fault of the devs never of management.
---
That's why I was looking into Mathilda that require minimal time but much patience.  
---
I've decided to look into PI and mining when I can play with very minimal attention.
---
Is it still working? (aka give you injector boost?)

TBH decide to not use injectors a while ago when i injected one of my super pilots ... and then check how much it cost me :D

i get that this is funny to some people. for the rest of us, it's the same as when that one friend recommends a movie for being high-calibre, and it ends up being transformers, or the new star wars

Brilliant! Hedliner - everyone knows he has the thinniest skin in the game...

Wrong here, PLEX is constantly being bought as it is constantly consumed - also **only consumed** PLEX lands in the monthly balance sheet.           
---
So PLEX that is spent on subs and store items (including extractors).            
---
Very nice

I think you can propose a lockdown vote for blueprints inside upwell structures now. Try that.

&gt; I'd like to go into pvp quite fast. What faction provides the best starting ships to do so?
---
Your character starting faction only impacts your starting location and with what skills you start with. But you can train all skills and fly all ships, without any restriction and without malus.
---
&gt; Should I join faction warfare for early pvp?
---
It is yes, and it creates special area of space where larger ships can't join in (like frigate only beacon you have to capture). That being said FW isn't in the best of states right now as is low security space in general. You can still get you kick, but it's not that full of fights. Other area of space (WH, NS) can provide you with good PvP content and newbro always have a place in fleet with cheap ships, like tackling or EWAR frigates, so even tho you are playing with the big boys you are still useful.
---
This is a pretty good shitpost.
---
Because content and fun. Some times ago goons easy pinged BL for kill our supers and caps because cant do it with only 130 man fleet like Loki's and bombers. BL easy join to this because content and easy kills. Later after PH with BL start war against GOTG, BL easy fighted against goons and now anytime drop it in Delve. I think for BL no mater who is blue or who is target, one what a have sence is a fight, content and fun. Sry for my bad english.

You can also roll mutaplasmids on the shield extenders (T2's to start with) to make it a bit beefier.

As someone who uses a very similar set-up (Extenders instead of purgers, NOS for DLA) I can confirm that it will do T4's. Just have to make sure you know when it's a good idea to pull back instead of charging forwards i.e. a group of webs and neuts with the Drifter BS in the background.

Hi, calando

The corporation's standings derive from it's members iirc, so it may be the case that low Caldari standings from their members has transferred over to the corp too, making that Corp (and therefore it's citadels) hated targets for the Caldari faction.

The number of points is the valid statistic, 2 scrams have 4 points, Scram/disruptor-Combi has 3 points which means that ships with 3 Stabs will get away. 
---
For example the special breed of "Exploration Bots" uses Asteros with 3 Stabs, to catch these you will need 4 points. As I consider a Faction Scram (3 instead of 2 points) as too expansive for a cheap hunting ship 2 scrams would be my choice.

Several months ago, chat basically got moved to a cloud instead of being handled totally through ccl servers and stuff. It was supposed to be fantastic and great and cutting edge and everything. Instead chat channels sporadically don't work, and CCP has hardly improved this let alone totally fixed it since. We got some free sp a while ago, but otherwise they hardly talk about it.

Singularity gives you a unique view on TQ actually. Years ago, people were actually "testing" frigates, cruisers, battleships. Then, they moved to carriers and dreads. Then (and especially when injectors were introduced) they moved to supers and titans. Now that the usual suspects all have a million alts in titans, almost nobody fies anything else because when a lone cruiser, battleship or whatever lands on CA1 or 2 and gets instapopped by 10 titans, it's neither fun or insightful. And since you can't reasonably do the thing you came there to do, why come at all? One more proof that super/titan and even capital overpopulation kills content.
---

My corp (Naked Oiled Bodybuilders) is funded by sugar daddy supreme CEO so we have a lot of freedom with what we do as a small gang. However even that is fairly restrictive for my autismal tastes so I make ship caches all over lowsec-highsec and npc null for myself and just fuck with people. Well used to at least I am on a break from EVE atm but there is a lot of fun to be had on your own. You don't have to get sick frags everytime or cause instant loss, I spent a few months up in Venal two years ago just killing cyno ships and selling cyno modules and fuel. It was good money and even better salt. If I know there is going to be a big OP around where I am I just go and pretend I am a scout and drag people along who think I am up to something that I am not. I never not tackle shit, I usually wait for the formup and then leave. Nothing like waiting for content starved farmer folk to set up skynets on bunch of gates for just the poor old me then logging off to play a superior videogame such as mountain blade warband.  At one point I had around 4 bil bounty on me from all the angry fat fingers hitting on that extra 0. These are stuff I am up to in low and null, highsec epic!!!!!!!! troll!! is much easier to do most of the time all I have to do is park in some guys site and wait for the conversation invite. I am not very creative and my dull imagination can cause big amounts of oofs! ouchies! and "fucking faggot"'s so don't think that you have to be an EVE wizard to get this kinda reaction out of people.   
---
As for logistics of it I can only give you my perspective of it but personally 300-500 mil is enough for me to set up a ship cache for epic!!! trolling and money making purposes. I usually use local market to get hulls and haul modules in myself. It is a bit risky but if you are vigilant you shouldn't lose much if any assets. I go for strictly t1 hulls such as vexors, vnis, canes, gnosis', t1 scanners and t1 frigs for different styles of engagement. If it is possible I try to set up shop in a system with unused astrahuses for free repairs. You kinda have to have an opportunistic mindset for both engagements and making iskies, I rarely ever got sick frags or had a steady income but one good day for me and I am few bils richer from ganking an unexpecting sedentary boy or stumble on a sig rich region with little and/or easy to deal with competition. However leaving your temporary home richer is not guaranteed, you might leave the region somewhat poorer or you might have to leave earlier than you think due to local competency/tenacity or just bad luck and/or bad decisions on your part 
---
Personally I find hobo playstyle very enjoyable and I highly advise it for people who like to do stuff (or those who want to learn to do stuff) on their own, rewards are rarely tangible but if you go at it you are guaranteed to have fun stories and straight up bizzare shit you encounter to share with your friends. If it is your first time don't burn bridges with people you play with (unless you hate them or whatever) being a hobo is much easier when you know there is a home you can go back to. At least until you perfect the playstyle of mooching off of others space and structures.
---
That sounds like a good ROI. I use a Burner Setup with 2 additional pullers on a 4-Agent-Station, so it is basically possible to reject everything except Burners and 3 Missions with 10k+ LP I can blitz in under 5 minutes. Usually 150-200k LP per hour, with more LP it would be really hard to buy enough tags to convert the LP with 5-run-bpcs and I would have to convert with Implants, Ammo and other stuff with really shitty conversion rates of under 1500ISK/LP (I have 3k-5k ISK/LP atm with bpcs).

Being part of a big story is easy and fun. Piloting a ship+scout while looking at killboards of most people you run across with is stressful and takes a lot of effort. It's not guaranteed fun but the payout is much more; people who don't have a lot of time don't like to essentially gamble if they will have fun or not.
---
Bots can spam dscan effortlessly and without fail.

Damn. What was the justification supposed to be? I don't see many advantages that would come from that outside of places like jita
---
We also had T3C fleets at that time as well.

Aside from being forced into those doctrines by the old void bombs, i really enjoyed how those fleet types interacted with each other. Even if all parties on the field were flying one or the other. (Or bombers)

 He is on my omega acct with my main. I wish he was alpha.

This won't change even with more SP, you just have to hop over that step. A VNI Alt can be trained with Alpha Status for nearly 2/3 of the skillplan, so basically for free. If you put it on the same account as your Main, maybe consider a Galaxy Pack special offer (I got one for 49 U$). You get 6 months game time + 2 MultiCharacter-Trainings + Stuff you can sell for close to 5 Bil (1100 PLEX + 5 Extractors). Then you can train both chars simultaneously.

I think that is the main hurdle though. I forced my self to lose. And lose, and lose, and lose. When I started I assembled 100 frigs, and the first 7 I lost in less than 5 minutes, as I just kept undocking them into a firestorm. My corp mates were positive about the whole thing, and it was really the way I broke out of that feeling, and got good

They do. ESI has a mandatory backoff feature that means if you make 100 requests that return errors in a single minute, you get banned for the rest of the minute. It stops error storms where something goes wrong on the esi backend and third party software reacts by retrying as aggressively as possible, making the situation worse.

The invalid_token error indicates you may at some point have revoked access to the application, or perhaps changed the password on the account that the token is linked to. Try unregistering and reregistering the character (file-&gt;manage accounts-&gt;delete character and then add character).

Newbro here. What are these botters and broadcasters everyone is complaining about?
---
He helps to the point he usually is broke. 
---
they'll park a vpn'd alpha on each gate
---
He was banned for 30 days, per CCP policies. If he screws up again it will be permanent, but that would require him to actually login. Really should calm down over something that happened 7 years ago.
---
Only in .Vibe you can do Abyssals or kill ratting supers!
---
Nice to hear from you :)
---
Honestly those are the sounds of delve in a nutshell
---
I actually choose to do the opposite now. I keep high transversal while moving toward the drifter BS (to get under guns) while overheating pretty much everything and killing the neuts then webs. That method has given me some close calls, but the same amount of close calls I had when I pulled back like you're suggesting. 
---
You're an idiot?  Don't be so hard on yourself.
---
For the region - sure, opening possibilities for new people - sure.       
---
For sov holding groups in Esoteria and Period Basis - nope as someone can actually move in range capital fleet instead of grinding 1.5 regions of sov first.          
---
Tbh still don't know why CCP is against giving this region of New Eden some life again. 
---
Fair enough.  Send him to Doomheim.
---
Thats not really the issue though (on top of the rigs not really being expensive).
---
Its the fact a capital ship and a battleship has the same scan res, or a capital ship has more scan res than a battleship.
---
Thats like a hurricane and tempest both being 125mm scan res (hurricane is around 275mm for reference). Sure, i can put a SEBO and rig on the cane to increase sig res, but why do i even need to, they shouldnt be close to each other. Scan res difference shouldnt be module driven, but a base stat factor.
---
 As ship class changes, scan res goes down. That doesnt really happen going from BS to capital. Bumping BS scan res up would help fix this disparity.
---
For reference, i actually have used a subcontoller rig and SEBO on a Rokh. It got me a blistering 170mm scan res, at the sacrifice of a lot of tank.
---
This is very concerning. I tested this use case in the past when I set up my alt corp and it wasn't possible then.
---
I just retested with both canceling and completing a research job from a query only hangar location with an output location of a query/take hangar.  However, I was not able to replicate.  In both my tests the BPO ended back up in the original qeury only hangar.  This was done in a Raitaru.  
---
Can you elaborate on the exact steps?
---
Not as important of an issue as the next set of skins coming out in a few weeks for just 650 PLEX!
---
You've missed that they increase your max locked targets then which makes them quite useful for filling an empty high slot on certain ships.
---
Recons ftw
---
From some quick searches, the CSM confirmed last year that the "dedicated balance team" initiative was scrapped.  
---
*Ahhh*, I did not know that.
---
why would you run nullsec sites in a dread
---
Whatever you say man, whatever you say. Sounds to me like you died to a gate camp recently.
---
But they did - on one of my chars local was accidentally working then.      
---
I was in M-O with my corp on a roam and i had a local from Obe and someone looking like CCP employee posted that **"local is working fine and logs don't show anything unusual that could say otherwise"**    
---
Tried to paste this to my fleet chat - but it was broken.           
---
Jesus fuck CCP what are you doing 
---
Botters use programs that automatically fly their ships for them. So they are programmed to mine or kill pirates for example and warp to a safe point instantly as soon as someone enters the system.
---
Players can't do anything about it because they are not catchable and a delayed local would fix that.
---
I think with the broadcasters he meant that there are lots of "afk" accounts cloaked in many systems that report automatically about any traffic
---
&gt;  i did not login to sisi for quite some time now
---
You answered it yourself already ;-) ... the only reason to login to SiSi atm is to check out what censorship restrictions will change unique game elements in China or what bug there is that can be exploited on release as it wont be fixed for sure no matter how many persons report it on SiSi.
---
Is it the fault of the management to hire shitty devs ? ... just thinking
---
So it was good for both?
---
Maybe it's because out of the 100ps upvotes on those shit memes not a single person actually reported it ingame... as far as fixing old bugs they are trying to kill pos code literally rewriting millions of lines of code that had no notation... bound to be some issues along the way. It takes time to fix
---
Even though they can still be bought and the name doesn‚Äòt state ‚ÄûExpired‚Äú, they can‚Äòt be used anymore. 
---
Upon attempted consumption a window pops up reading that the boosters expired on monday DT. 
---
Cerebral Accelerators will work until DT 15th of January.
---
It is not required of you to buy what I am selling. It's free and will end up on your doorstep either way. 
---
You too ma man! Hope you didnt lose your super on that moveop! :-/
---
Which eyebrows my character in eve or my irl skin suit? 
---
What exactly do you have in mind?
---
LEX reunion in here, ey?
---
Reminder that the character bazaar still exists to this very day. If you have cybernetics 5 your character should sell pretty easily. 
---
Yeah you would not believe the volume of tags people go through trying to liquidate like 5-10mil of LP haha. Interesting it must depend on the faction, BPCs have never been that profitable for me. I've never gotten that much, typically accounting for tags at buy order prices I sit between 1500-2000ISK/LP
---
This thread would be funnier if CCP Falcon posted in it
---
You just seem... i dunno... super bitter? Salty? dunno. 
---
Each time i hear the "delayed local" the first thing that come to mind is that person posting it don't have wife and kids - and without any issues can spend more than 15min in front of PC without needing to go away for "a second".
---
Sooner or later the Reddit shitposting takes us all.

Never, because its a useless feature no one wanted.

Hit by a post truck as a teen on a motorbike, wheelchair from then on.

---
I am sad he didn‚Äôt get to see the astronomical level of shitposting we get here.
---
I don't know if it would be that great either or if it's the best solution but that's what most people suggest. Just wanted to explain how bots work
---
You'd have to sacrifice something though. Most likely tank, for some doctrine maybe targeting or gun/missile range.
---
Just to get to where BS should reasonably be (imo).
---
So you rat in a phoniex around 2100?
---
It's almost as if capital ships weren't a very good idea.
---
Shower thought: What if a capital ship took several people to operate, and the various mechanics of flying one would mean you'd need to pay full attention and couldn't multibox it?
---
So this is common for a company to go lean to get sold. It boosts profits and make the company more desirable to buy. That said the deal doesnt prevent growth from that 250 number. As ccp games are hiring a number of positions some being posted recently. 
---
I'm really amused by all the BjornBee fanbois on here.  Apparently his streams are some kind of spiritual experience for you, rather than a kind-of intense boredom puncutated by insincere laughter.
---
Glad to see Sue making waves beyond Hek's Boundless Creation Factory.

She's come along way from the Bei gate
---
Nah.
---
1) I've never died to a gate camp.  You have to be just about trying.
---
2) Gate camping affects absolutely nothing important.  You've deceived yourself if you think otherwise.
---
3) there are no legendary gate campers. That's fucking hilarious you think otherwise.
---
Tested +, for fun

You're playing the game right friend! Keep on keeping on!
---
fucking shit urself retards, fold to snuff when?
---
Day 1 of stainguy not being banned btw
---
Does he have some skills that you can use to passively earn ISK? Like planetary interaction and science. I have assigned 250k SP CCP gave to every character last year to PI skills on all my 2nd and 3rd characters, was just enough to train Command Center Upgrades, Interplanetary Consolidation and Advanced Planetology to III.
---
Consider it done
---
This would include "giving life to New Eden". Looks like the Dev Timeline has the opposite goal -  make EVE fully afk-able
---
Do you have a size = cost?
---
And then you can be the logi anchor and learn about manual piloting and not going at 0 angular velocity and so on.
---
Thank you for taking a look.  Appreciate the feedback.
---
Why have a game balance and functionality discussion about removing local as an intel source when you can just break it?
---
Missing the point. 
---
We're on a corp EU4 deployment. 
---
Sorry not sorry.
---
This list needs some updating. Eve Trade Master for instance is completely dead. https://evemarketer.com/ should be the go to market resource
---
Missing the point. They had couple of years to do Tiericide. Yet they would rather release overpriced skins after skins. Without even single glance toward Tiericide that they begun but not finished. 
---
Apart from everyone who does.
---
I don't really agree with the no one part.  There are some good communities who's whole purpose is to help newbros, might give Eve-University a try.  They do classes and everything, give out ships that new players can use for free, etc.
---
&gt; And they weren't working on four games in 2007.
---
they aren't working on 4 games now either
---
 GOTT SCH√úTZE DEN KAISER
---
Sell the char or turn him into sp farm. 
---
Train cybernetic 5, remap attributes, plug in 2x +5 implants and train two long skills back and forth like battleship or whatever. Buy multiple character training, use it on sp farm character wait 3 weeks or so, extracts and sell. Repeat.

&gt; this guy is like 85% likely to just quit the game now.  
---
They're after that 15% that will open up that wallet.   
---
Everyone who wasnt around for the proposed restructure i guess.
---
People wanted it until ccp announced that to make it happen, 95% of the dev teams would be devoted to it, for about a year. The remaining half dozen or so devs would be around to handle bug fixes.
---
For a 'feature' that amounts to a 3d chat room, leaving the actual game to rot for that long kinda pissed everybody off.
---
So while i have no doubt there are plenty like you who heard about incarna and think itd be fun, the reality is it would be a fucking useless waste of resources that adda absolutely nothing of value to the game. It's dead, and it needs to stay dead.
---
leave ma reliks alone...big NO to stain lowsex gate
---
Ah snowflakes, outraged at any and everything! Nothing to see here, this is not the post you are looking for. 
---
They taking action. Now it is unreliable source of info. Next step is to allow bubles in Jita.
---
Bots are programs that run continuously carrying out repetitive tasks like mining, killing rats, and auto-updating market orders. It is automation of game play to gain advantage over other players.
---
Broadcasters use a program that "broadcasts" a single command to multiple clients. This means they can control say ten ships as if they were one.
---
Join the OP and you will go broke buying a different doctrine ship every day.

LOL it‚Äôs prob. Just an alt , who cares about a super loss nowadays

95% of devs devoted to a podcast called TALKING in stations done by a non dev?
---
I'll ignore the rest as it's completely irrelevant bollocks to the question I asked.
---
I mean, his streams are entertaining, you don't like it, yet you feel a need to also try and i dunno? comment? As said, just dunno what your issue is :\\ 
---
&gt; Actually CCP is doing a lot ... but not what players desire.
---
CCP do do a lot of thing that players desire. Just because you dont find say abyssals and related development useful doesn't mean a lot of players don't like these. And so on for just about anything.

He's talking about trolling sov for fights, which he would know about since he frickin did all the time.

WTT  Event site development for a bug fixes and stability improvements          
---
(aka look at last event. nice - i guess sure, din't even enter a single site, but cmon like more and more stuff is failing apart)
---
In tickets we sent in they said "This isn't happening."
---
How dare we expect the game we pay for to work. 
---
i'm australian. cunt is just another word for "dude" here
---
&gt; We have no FC's, everyone just knows what the fuck they are doing.
---
"Knowing what to do" is really hard when you've never done it. It is really depressing to make a mistake a loose your shit. I've been in large fight as logi, I like them, because they give a context of things I understand (repping, broadcasting, anticipating damage, managing heat), while someone takes care of the shit I'm really bad at (positioning, decision making, knowing ranges and angle of weapons and shit). And the general aspect of being part of a large fight is generally pretty good. Now sure you're just a pawn, but got to understand that people enjoy simple things. Ping u/WallymartsEve because that's what I disagree with what you said in another comment tree. Some people just enjoy that, being part of the group and just being a brick in the whole. Not everyone is good at Eve PvP and would probably quite the game if they had to PvP on their own. Some people like working with a certain framework and some people enjoy freedom.
---
And again, I agree with you, small gang shit and setting up your own actions is great and feels rewarding when you achieve shit, but they also feels really bad when you fails and you just forgot about that one mechanic or you just get outnumbered badly. The path of trial and error is the way of Eve but not everyone can reach even a somewhat good level at it. Got to understand that.
---
Except that he's still playing.
---
I call that natural selection bro. 
---
Updated as I made a mistake
---
Because Eve isn't about realismit's about gameplay, and good design create much more value/content/occasion than realism.
---
But the bots die without local to protect them
---
&gt;injected (...) into a super (...) lost it less than 24 hours (...) guy is (...) likely to just quit the game now                 
---
Let me translate this to you. ^(assuming not an alt)     
---
This person came to eve, allowed CCP make a lot of money from injectors/extractors - assuming 30mil SP injected - and without to many cost possibly leave the game (unless it not inject to a titan or fax alts)                
---
Injecting 30mil SP translates to ~~40 mil sp that someone first need to train (aka pay CCP ) then someone need to extract those skills ( aka pay CCP again).                     
---
My issue is I think his streams are shit.  I think most Eve streams are shit though (apart from some commentary on INN).  In fact most gaming streams as a whole are shit, so I really couldn't care less if doves come out of his bum when he bends over.
---
You all piled onto me I notice and I will continue to respond because you're all so hurt about it it's now funny.
---
&gt;12-30bn cargo buried in your belly isn't enough to warrant a swarm of disposable talos's.

Kitchen sink fleets can be fun though. You have no idea what you can actually engage since no one is flying the same fit so engage everything. 
---
Wow you are just stupid.
---
Gentle reminder that the initial draft of citadels allowed for asset safety in wormholes, but after much wailing and gnashing of teeth, it was revoked.
---
I don't know if this is the case, But oposit navys bashing structures  in FW would be a good fix to cits in FW.
---
System switches from Gallente to Caldari, here comes the navy to RF and kill all gallente FW cits
---
Class 1-3 wormholes will spawn pirate relic and data sites. If you scan anything down and it has 'unsecured' in the name it will be a sleeper site and have rats at the site and should be avoided.
---
I mean you called a guy who actually is having fun, insincere, which you know, just seemed silly. Beyond that you come over as super upset that the guy is actually having fun playing EVE. Dunno how you define a "good" stream though if you think they are all shit apart from INN. I guess that is more subjective. Nice thing is the variety of EVE streamers to find something for most tastes. 
---
Well, removal of watch list along with many other changes had the opposite of player retention. It‚Äôs a hardcore MMO that‚Äôs turning soft. Problem with eve is that fact they did many changes too fast without watching nor fixing the negative effects. This ran off veterans players and attract newer players but made a stagnant game which ultimately doesn‚Äôt benefit player retention. There‚Äôs been great changes to the health of eve and horrible changes. Free to play was a great introduction for new and old player retention and skill injectors should‚Äôve never exist.
---
As far as high sec, players had options and thats truly all that matters. Wardecs weren‚Äôt driving players away because they stayed to bitch about it. HS ganking had more devastating effect on new players then wardec ever could, simply because one gave a warning while the other was surprise butt sex. When it came to wardecs, new player would just make a new corp for 10k isk while it cost 50mil to wardec. That alone was broken as they would hop from corp to corp without having to wait for the 7days cool down period. They would also get a 24hr notice saying they were wardec to begin with. They could drop to a NPC and stay or they could simply make and join a new one and troll, again, without waiting the 7 days as long as they dropped into npc first. Ganking didn‚Äôt give those options. That new player who waited half a year and skilled into a freighter then bought it with plex, gets a public courier to deliver goods from here to there and gets ganked mid way in high sec. No warning, no options for him/her to escape, nothing but the exception of ‚Äúdont fly what you can‚Äôt afford to lose and no where is safe‚Äù.  You can replace freighter with incursion runner also. Those players feel as if they hit a dead end because the only option they have to counter is not to look like a valuable target. Yet there‚Äôs players who were ganked for the hell of it. So it was a roll of the dice for them. But when the community look at player retention, we point at wardec......how? Because that new player who joined a mining corp was wardec and they tried to fight but failed? Then ran to null sec where they complained for an umbrella for all their crabbing protection needs and got it? When asked what made them not play in HS they cry wardecs yet they are still playing? Not trying to sound insulting but if this is the CSM mindset then the board doesn‚Äôt have the proper player knowledge to successfully recommend changes for HS mechanics. Change to wardec mechanics are one of those really bad eve changes where they over look a bigger problem and patch something that never needed to be fixed in the first place. It‚Äôs like trying to fix a car with no knowledge of how to fix it or whats wrong with it, but where going to change it from a standard to automatic because thats the problem. In reality it just needed gas. 
---
To answer all high sec questions. If you wanted to safely mine, rat, play at your own pace without being told what to do. High sec offered you that. You have to stay NPC where risk vs reward was balanced out. The only think that could stop you was the fact you wanted your own banner or ganking. Wardec mechanics only played when you made a corp, even then you could jump around corp to corp with your friends while giving the deccers the bird. Again only thing that could truly stop you was ganking. 2012-2014 i saw a great deal of corp hoppers/NPC corps (made their own channel and played as a corp while in NPC). Ganking was at a high especially with all the code crap and i saw a huge decline in those players 2015-2016. So if you want to see more players leave, go ahead and make an even more stagnant game and remove more content from eve. We already forced all the small gang, sub cap pvp into this hideous FC doctrine fitted, lack of player skill blob to defend the alliance supers and titans on grid for a few players gain in a retarded feud. 
---
Anyway i hope some good changes do come but honestly it doesn‚Äôt look like it. I‚Äôm unsubscribed as I‚Äôm waiting for Lowsec, WH, HS to become alive again. Looking for small gang/solo pvp to be a thing again. Doesn‚Äôt look that way with more and more people injecting into caps which requires a large number of subcaps to counter/break capitals, which ultimately removes content from smaller groups. For me, games like dota 2, BFV, and Albion are enough to satisfy my eve addiction to keep me away until the eve unfucks itself. Only time will tell.
---
Yes the have relic and data sites without sleepers. They have faction names like Guristas, Sansha, Angel etc. They can be very profitable. Just watch out for the locals, they will kill you and take your shit.
---
WH have what we call a class. Main classes are C1 to C5. C1 to C3 are called low class WH and C4 to C6 are called high class WH. Only low class WH will have pirate faction relic and data the way you find in known space. You can easily know they are safe in their name (sansha ruins, guristas something, etc). Beware not every relic or data sites in low class WH are pirat faction relic/data sites for explorers. Some are combat sites with sleepers (but they won't have the pirat faction name in the signature name so you can dodge them). You will have to find a website to know the class of the WH you're in to save some times, just googling the J name of the WH is enough to find such a site generally.
---
To sum it up :
---
- When going in a WH, google the name of the system. If it's a C4 or above, disregard (or try to scan a C1 to C3 entry if you see such a static)
---
- When scanning signatures, only warp if it contains the name of the pirat faction in it.
---
There are no legendary alliance OPs either. To me that is. Just a bunch care bears chest beating over bigger capital numbers. To me it would be the same as doing a mining OP. You are just a number and your contribution is not really important. At least with mining you can get profit.
---
Its really all about perception and what you like about EVE. What milieu you are part of. There are plenty groups blocking off low sec routes that have kept it up for years on end, getting lots of reputation and generating fun fights and content. Just as I am sure some people like the military style alliance stuff. And for them and you that might be fun.
---
Poor you. Can‚Äôt even turn off blink.

Left giant nullsec entities, Joined a wormhole corp, we rageroll with random bullshit for content, most fun I've had in EVE since like 2009 doing......random 4-7 pilot random nano bullshit with The Hatchery/Team Liquid in lowsec
---
Sensing a theme here...
---
Yes, please!
---
You get notifications about new anoms?
---
Yah everyone has there own names for me :P
---
That would explain quite a bit
---
Im missing Isk per Hour, the industry app
---
For carriers this could be solved by 1 person piloting the ship itself and then having 1 additional pilot per fighter squadron. It would be harder for dreads, faxes and titans, simply because flying a slow-ass ship (and sometimes even in tidi) is actually very simple. You just click modules and sometimes approach/align/warp. Nothing you could really outsource to other players that would be anything close to enjoyable.
---
Anyone up for mentoring an alpha scrub? It'd probably be nice. And maybe actually get me back into the game. 
---
It's called cloaking. It's something wormholers have used since 2009. 
---
It's possible to run WH sites. Don't mess with sleepers because they will kill the shit out of you, and don't mess with other pilots because they will kill the shit out of you more.
---
It can be done and done profitably if you remember you're not a combat ship. You run from fights. You run from D-scan. You run from glare on your monitor. Just warp out at the first indication that there might be trouble.
---
There are two different ways to run abyssal sites. You can take a cruiser in solo, or you can take frigates in, which you can do in groups of up to 3. I actually solo the group sites second tier, but ymmv depending on skills and fit. The frigate site drops seem to be pretty similar to the cruiser one, except that there are more of them, since, obviously you are expected to split loot with people. Because you are mostly hoping to roll for the slightly more rare, more valuable items to sell, I think overall the frigate sites are better to run than the cruiser ones, because you get more rolls for each site. If you are active in US time and interested, you can come run some with my corp to give them a try. I'll straight up give you a fitted ship so you can give it a try risk free.

I really dislike killboards. It's nice to look back and see all the stuff you've killed, the fights you've been in and stuff, but they are really a trash metric for gauging the success of individual pilots. There are instances where you can tell a lot about someone from their killboard, but I feel like that's only really the case in the more extreme ends of the spectrum.
---
We are founding our own alliance now in aridia  we where already working togheter with People from 3 differents corpses and yesterday we decided to make our own alliance  small and not a lot of People but it's Fun 
---
I literally cannot see how chat dying is a problem. 
---
Wormholer btw
---
Had to google to confirm this - lol. 
---
&gt; asking for a ~~friend in INIT~~ sister
---
It's cool I've just seen so many people say that felt like correcting it. Anyways the cash flow statement is probably a better indicator due to how much Plex and isk is inactive.
---
you remember aura? she became the agency, and descided "screw him, he wont let me on his ship anymore. i'm gonna clone myself and stick it on his ship so he'll never be rid of me!"
---
so now you have the agency permanently camping out on your ship like a hobo AI with a grudge against ya
---
Personally, I don't understand why a carrier/super should be able to lock as fast as a frigate
---
Yeah, I see why Brainstraw, Velsh, and Casper would fight cruisers and bc in this ship it is unbelievably nasty. 
---
C4s are still considered low class scum.
---
But in the end we don't have any of the info, so is all a crapshoot.
---
Can I just have Eve? Just put me in control and I'll fix it. Just stop making it worse...
---
This is actually true i remember the WH town hall about this - and people saying "it is not about getting stuff, but about getting those guy stuff"             
---
There were multiple ideas, basically big groups that do most of the evicting now wanted full drop (including HK) smaller people wanted assets locked out until citadels are re-anchored .... **CCP did listen majority of WH people at this point don't wanting any asset safety**
---
Well he did say "I don't like his name", which I totally understand, as I extracted and doomed a whole bunch of characters for the same reason about 18 months ago.  
---
I may also change my name IRL (it's Gertrude Perkins), for the same reason.
---
??
---
This argument has always been fukin stupid.
---
Doesnt matter how many times you kill him; he can still fly a super.
---
Except npcs are too cowardly to go to lowsec at all.
---
Stockholm syndrome. Eve is my life now.
---
w-space 4 lyfe!
---
This reads like a stroke patient trying use speech to text in some places. 
---
When are the crab skins coming out for Eve? 
---
pls keep this away from matterall
---
he'll refocus the discussion away from interesting things said by knowledgeable people and to himself asking "do keepstars die if they take enough damage? I'm not sure" 
---
tfw BL is in such a bad state that they answer batphones to shoot undefended astras for content and fun.
---
2 mobile chinashit games, nova...
---
oh I get it. they're working on 3
---
1. I have seen bots in wormhole space.
---
2. The reduced bots is due to logistics involved in earning income.  Looting field and transporting to kspace for sale is a big speedbump for bots.
---
Removing or delaying local in kspace may have other reasons to be considered, but it does not solve or even meaningfully address bots.
---
&gt; a major corp from feign left to join Badfellas to farm isk for supers.
---
Oof. That's how a corp gets overrun by turbokrabs.
---
Sure there are many groups providing a middle ground and aim to provide a variety of PvP to their members. If you stick around long enough you will surely have great fleet experiences.
---
Imo the issue are groups that do the opposite, demotivating their members, "don't undock, don't feed - they will come back looking for more targets"
---
Those are the groups you should be running away from.
---
&gt;Ass Mads
---
&gt;You will be a prime collector and consumer of the Ass Mads currency and this currency is quite delicious despite the shitty undertone inherently its name.
---
Its a niche i was searching for a long time but now it sustains me well since 2-3 years. I was a little bit afraid lately when speculations raised the sell order prices of 2 tags i need by 100% to 300% percent. But as the faction item prices followed this quite close, my conversion rate did not change ... There is one item where I can buy the tags from sell orders, sell the item to buy orders and still net close to 6k LP, just the daily traded numbers of that item are not so high as from the items that net me between 3 and 5k.
---
It's being scanned on today hopefully, sizes and options will be discussed soon. Stay tuned for updates!
---
Or, you know, you can test stuff. 
---
If you open the agency window, for the remainder of the session the icon on the neocom flashes when there is a sig refresh.
---
Pisses me off to no end, so I avoid opening my agency window as it only flashes if it has been opened that session.
---
You guys wanted to have no asset safety in wormholes. Why are you complaining about something you fought so hard back when citadels were implemented?
---
Made you form AND made you read a shit post. Damn we're good. 
---
and 23 of them are SKIN artists.
---
I think they think you're talking about walking in stations lmao
---
In terms of programming or development, many studios spend years developing a foundation for their schema.  This accounts for a bloat in worker need.  If your foundation is already implemented and you are simply adding code for modules, you do not need an impressive amount (650) of programmers or developers.
---
The larger your architecture foundation, the less employees you need.  Just because they don't have as many people doesn't mean they can't produce a relative amount.
---
You may not be the hero we deserve but you are the hero we need! 
---
lol these people are the leaders and thinkers from war dec corps? 
---
seriously?
---
The "[insert ship] online" trope refers to something that propagates several playstyles. You dont really see muninns ratting. Ishtars Online, was ishtars being the go to ship for ratting, fleet fights and even some small gang stuff.
---
Capitals Online and Drakes online is the same thing.
---
Frigate menace/T3d era didnt have frigs/t3ds ratting or major factors in fleets, they were just everywhere in the roaming meta.
---
Granted, you were probably just meme'ing with the comment. If Elo returned for muninn ratting CTAs, we could probably fit that in there.
---
The best way to avoid being evicted is to always put up a fight, be honest and polite with other entities and you'll eventually get a minimal amount of respect. Groups looking to evict might be put off by that, if you fight back you're likely going to cost them. It'll cut down the profit margin. They'll go for a juicier, more brachyuran target.
---
You can't extract under 5mil. So 5.5 mil is the point you can use an extractor, since you'll have 5mil left after use.
---
&gt;Shadow Cartel
---
Yeah he's pretty safe running it in a dread from you nerds ))
---
As I said, you can test what bug to exploit next ... 
---
Most other things you can also test ingame, like fittings and stuff.
---
Last time I felt the need to test something on SiSi was new citadels and complexes ... building a keepstar and so on. Maybe its because I play for close to 12 years now and see EVE as a matrix (green excel sheets flowing over screen lol) 
---
He means the exceptions, dingus. 
---
I usually used those on my ratting VNI's. They're quite convenient for this purpose, but other than that, they're very special and seldomly used.
---
We should assume bots and broadcasters are not banned because they are being protected. t20 was "active support". Refusing to enforce the EULA against blatant cheaters is "passive support".
---
The subcap meta isn't much better.  Ferox is a high skilled doctrine yo.
---
TLDR: not blue stuff is showing up in space is getting shot. 
---
wow very cool post its so sentimental!
---
Good. Fuck Sue Abbot. 
---
You basically need to cross train into other race ships and guns because in eve there is no "best ship", every ship in eve can be good if used in correct circumstances (especially in pvp). Although there obviously are ships of 1 race that are better at their role than other race ships. 
---
man you get more retarded everytime you open your mouth dont you?
---
420 gank ratters erryday
---
How's that Vigilant doing these days?
---
I'm not an expert in all the ways of drinking coffee, but I feel you may be doing it wrong.
---
&gt;truth is Team security is doing their job as fast as they can. They ban thousands per month throughout the month. They post about this regularly.
---
Why arent the concord baiters banned? Whats up with the "caught" command broadcaster not getting banned? Even when its about as certain as it will get that some players cheat, nothing happens. Why is that?
---
CCP pretty much has to be "protecting" certain players at this point.
---
You want them to listen when we ask nothing of them?
---
I have no idea what that is, but I am sure its trying to be kind of edgy insulting.
---
You might not, but then again, if you're going deep the rabbit hole you're probably gonna want to do multiple stuff at the same time. Like, scout your blingy 2 bil Loki with a ceptor. Or web your freighter so it gets faster into warp, or light a cyno for your capital ship. Or spin a VNI while you roam faction warfare. Or get a spy into Pandemic Horde while your main is in another corporation. Or get a fax pilot for your supercarrier/Titan. Being able to alpha train some characters for free makes this a breeze.
---
I would be surprised if they have more than 1 tard on the event team.  The last 5 events have had 0 QA (vital parts required to complete them broken on release so nobody can actually do the event) and they seem to learn nothing from the issues of each event.
---
Can I have stuff?
---
... what do you think an NDA is?
---
or do you think we're talking about the abandoned "walking in stations" feature?
---
We're talking about getting CSM members whose NDA has expired to speak about it on a talk show called "talking in stations"
---
wow, sorry that he sometimes caters to the new players listening in to the show.   
---
Matterall can be such a cunt at times /s  
---
also NDA expiration show is something TIS has planned to do for a long time, its not a fucking new concept bro.
---
You pointed out the Idiocracy reference right after you made the reference. It really took away from the allure and grandeur that I was experiencing. Thought you should know.
---
Also, not on the same account. Ideal setup is to train your main, make another two chars on the same account (for me is jita alt and a hauler)  and two other chars on two other accounts that you don't really play but login from time to time to train some skills
---
I still got few getting rusty
---
These are rookie numbers!
---
Ferox is only strong in fleets. It needs some more massaging definitely (it does 80% of what a vulture does for a fraction of the cost). Its not oppressive in other metas though.
---
Battleships would counter Ferox fleets easily. Problem is, battleships get countered by nearly everything except BCs. They can get bombed easily, HACs can sig tank and project similarly and they get stomped on by the massive dong of any capital fleet.
---
If literally everyone quits except the bots, I'd bet EVE would still be profitable.  CCP hasn't put any real money back into it in years, and bots don't care about the server problems.  Win-Win for CCReeee so they can chase the next fad.
---
The best feeling is when you trigger someone who has someones Balls in his mouth who is pretending to be elite :)

Joking aside, I have not and never will make racist remarks.

Oh there is bling shit in low sec too??

yeah, sharing ownership and control of an asset in Eve couldn't possibly go wrong...

So I'm going to apologize as now I can't recreate it.
---
Last night, when my alt selected to research a blueprint's material efficiency and selected the output location to be the open supply, it came out there. Today...I can't get it to do so. When I repeat the steps, it doesn't come out in open supply and stays where it was.
---
So thank you for trying to help me, but apparently, permissions didn't update right or something till I restarted the client. IDK...
---
That idea would require multiple people to be doing that 24/7 and would yield you the same result as just having an active corp around most timezones. Evictions aren't really a huge worry because as a wormholer some of my most fun fights have been evicting, preventing an eviction on someone else or third partying an eviction. Best practice is to make lots of friends and contribute to the community by giving the pewpew.
---
I would like to do c3,c4 relic data sites solo in wh space for the blue loot. I've heard that Nestor are good but I can't seem to find a good fit for solo operation, I'm also interested in a good fit for a rattlesnake for the same thing since I've heard those are good as well. 
---
JUST SEED DREADS ON EVERY ROAM, EZ, GIT GUD
---
Honestly I'm glad they answer the batphone.  It's more fun to fight them than any of the dudes who call them.
---
omg i was laughing so hard at some of the bullshit you wrote there. really entertaining:  
---
"Of late, PanFam have begun flying more Thrashers, Cormorants,  T1 battle  cruisers, and battleships, apparently trying to save isk in SRP  payouts."  
---
The alliance with the new dudes flys T1 stuff. Sure man we must be broke af. rofl.
---
btw, think about just to reach out to sv for sharing structures. it maybe would be a workaround of the problem that you guys get nothing at all actually done.  
---
I thought you were going to say a Corp IKEA deployment. 
---
Living the null static dream. Friendship ended with high class.
---
This was a good post wtf
---
Tornados cant fit large ones :/ or do you use 2-3 tornados with medium sb's
---
FW. You don't really have much assets that need protecting. At worst the enemy captures some systems that you will have to then retake later.
---
I kill rorqs and crabs 4 life pays good.
---
NS static is probably the most content I've had in Eve so far.
---
No doubt about it, there are some people that are legitimately willing to help... Good alliances, friendly to newbros, can‚Äôt argue with that at all. BUT, if you default to trust no one, then make exceptions as necessary, you will have a much safer start than most... 
---
The Freki is amazing. Haters gonna hate.
---
Nothing of value has been lost
---
if more corps do this, i am completely confident that the health of the game will be better
---
Lawl, fighting makes you more of a target. Guranteed fight &gt; logging off in caps.
---
It is just so much more rewarding to be a part of a small group and doing things.
---
Also, you build up some pretty strong friendships
---
yes... but also it's the fault of management for starting projects that have no hope of success. there's a process for product development that some companies never get.
---
stop posting
---
As much as I am for LS to stain. Isn't it Eve lore that incursion NPCs and drifters come from Stain?
---
I am willing to bet i can take a person that generally is a one of many, and take them small ganging and in a week they will not only be more familiar with game mechanics, but will enjoy a whole new playstyle
---
It's not interesting. Please never post again.
---
The character still play and pvp so....it has happened to many people to loose a super...
---
How much does a Tiamat go for nowadays, anyways?
---
Thank you, i hope it inspired you
---
if the plex was destroyed with a player ship, I assume they could remove it from their accounting.
---
Is that an invitation?
---
Maybe ill come say hi in esoteria, would be super fun to be blobbed by 50 harpies and still only lose 1 ship
---
I came expecting to see something drawn out of mobile depots in Jita, and was very amazingly surprised with the awesomeness of this.
---
Bless you
---
Atleast dabble in the aspect of chaos. Get some corp mates interested in it.
---
If you can inspire a group in your corp to do this, i bet you will find it more rewarding and fun then large scale pvp. You might even get the corp to have an alternate staging just for this new idea
---
Only 321 mill? Jesus you're poor

Good Read Val..lmao.

Bro your comment on twitch got Automodded and I banned appropriately for the language that I refuse to allow on my channel. I swear like a sailor on stream so it takes a lot to get me to not hit accept on the automod. Sadly the record for the mod blocked chat isnt saved or I'd post it here. That said had you have used the system name to call out my location from a locate agent I'd have been totally game to let that through. But simply put the language wasnt acceptable for the channel. 
---
As I dont have a record of it due to automods inability to save blocked messages I'll retract the racist comment accusation but remind all I dont accept any level of hate being spread on my channel. A good ribbing is fine but there is a line in the sand
---
I was thinking he may not be the hero we need, but the hero we deserve.

&gt; My accounts are lapsing because of the way ccl is handling this and other bugs.

I haven't logged in since they sold out.
---
You don't use fleets or otherwise interact with your fellow corp members?
---
Hi
---
So i use colorful language in my posts, and it maybe be wrong or right, who knows.
---
I am sorry it struck a cord with you.
---
I myself and a father of 2, with 1 more on the way this month, i also have pretty limited eve time. I actually found more fun doing small gang vs large scale because one of the struggles of being a father of 2 is that by the time the 0200 formup happens, i have a kid to make sure he is fed, to make sure hes getting to bed and has his story for the night. I make sure my pregnant wife is taken care of as she is pretty close to the big day.
---
By the time i do all that, its nearly 9pm, and then do i really want to stay on a titan for 30-2 more hours in the hopes of seeing some action?
---
I found my time was better spent by taking a ship, a couple of friends, and just shitting in someone else's back yard. Metaphorically of course, i dont call up the nasty bois on my phone and pillage my neighborhood.
---
Join RvB for consistent in Corp organized fights and lowsec roams. Make sure to join Red Fed tho because Blue sucks.
---
OMG WHERE CAN I LIKE COMMENT AND SUBSCRIBE TO THIS CONTENT CREATOR?
---
Not the drifters
---
I appreciate your stories, those do seem like impact full actions. 
---
I love that "oi you look like a real mean cunt" is actually a compliment in australia
---
Not drifters but Stain is Sanshas home and that's the lore based reason we don't have one. None of the empires would want Sansha's Nation to have access to their area
---
Dont laugh man, he was being serious
---
Anything you can do with fleet chat you can do with discord and the fleet window. 
---
honestly, sometimes i wonder if a kitchen-sink fleet would be better than the fleet the FC calls for us to get in.
---
like when you go in caracals to a "surprise" structure bash....of a sotyo......
---
no one brought non faction ammo.
---
and no one brought large quantities of ammo cause caracals.
---
.....kitchen sink would have been better
---
Thanks a lot for getting back to me. I'll drop you a line ingame. 
---
Not really sure what the point of this post is, I guess because they've had to neut Frat to get local content??! (GL with that Frat btw). 
---
Besides, everyone knows it was to stay in their local Krablands :-p
---
"I Like Money"  --CCP Probably
---
I know they didn't invent it. The Mongols were actually one of the most famous. They would ride on horseback and whittle armies and constantly raid their supply lines.
---
I am aware that the minute mans actions were not solely responsible, however they were an integral part of reducing enemy troops moral, cause large supply line interruptions (Red Coats learned what wet boots that dont get replaced does) and degrading trust in commanders.
---
They played a major role, and were a small amount of people (compared to the vast numbers in the army)
---
Two? If you're REALLY interested start ten today and a skill farm of a hundred tomorrow

i bet you kiss girls you heretic

We put my new IKEA chair together over Christmas. That's done now.

ayyy
---
Don't use those other slots. Make two new accounts and use the refer a friend link for them. You get Plex if you ever sub them and they get 250K extra skill points to start with
---
my observations weren't made in the setting of big fleets, of course you don't expect people to not be anchoring and shit in a 200 man fleet, but what happened in small fleets and in conversations regarding theory with both these kinds of players.
---
Wait, really?  Is there a tutorial somewhere on how I can watchlist, warpto, share contracts, link types/fits, and trade from Discord?
---
Fair enough, if it's only a couple of each then I would typically do that as well. One time I barrelled into a spawn with at least 4 drifter neuts which made things *very* dicey indeed as they're impervious to the NOS. Ever since then I've erred on the side of caution. :)
---
@u/jestertrek I miss your blog. I keep revisiting it wondering when I will be able to read new things from you.
---
Because "not going wrong" is Eve's tagline.
---
Ahh ok ty. Although they do with wh?
---
Incarna
---
30 mining accounts, man what the fuck
---
Can do everything but the last two on the fleet window, can share fits over discord. If you're that desperate for contracts, sort by corp or alliance. Assuming fleet chat dies in the first place, never seen any issues with that on our end. 
---
Maybe it's something to do with not having to handle anything in local, or any intel/ratting bots. But hey, works well enough. 
---
I have grown to like it, it adds a bit of chaos to the game.. CCP should run with this one and make it a bit more unreliable.
---
I dont care about getting banned, I laughed about it when I posted the agent locater message and then followed you.
---
Im finding it hard to follow your logic. You say you "swear like a sailor" yet didnt allow the words pussy and sleazebag to be posted which were the only 2 messages i posted.
---
Good luck on your next csm election bud.
---
If literally no one in your small group can afford a carrier, they've got bigger worries than coming to null
---
Like ?
---
Because copying and pasting fits to and from discord, manually searching contracts, and manually locating people in the fleet window (I'd love to know how your logi wing deals with snowflake watchlists) are all reasonable alternatives to just being able to click on things in a single chat window...
---
Fleet and custom chats are just as fucked as local, just not as frequently (I assume because of decreased load).  I've had the fleet chat buffer 20+ minutes of messages and then load them all at once; I've had chat globally stop working at all; and I've had the "changed to local: Jita" spam in completely unrelated chat windows.
---
It's not a local problem, it's a "the entire chat backend is fucked" problem.
---
&gt; this guy is like 85% likely to just quit the game now.
---
OP is a special.
---
Some groups use a program called near3 to monitor all real time space activity in their J-Space pocket. Use that

Also his seating position..

I think they're going to desensitize us to lack of local then move us all to wormholes.

how much time to fix the local bug? 2 years?

Abyssal pvp arena closes 30mins after the fight and kills any pilots if they remain on grid.   
---
As far as i know, a Curse is usually strong counter to cap stable deimos, especially those blinged curse are almost unbeatable.   
---
But i somehow managed to fight him until the very last moment.   
---
After 30mins of fight, the curse pilot realizes he cant kill me and initiated self-destruction that i didnt notice.    
---
his curse was killed just 10 secs before the arena collapse.  
---
Which also means i still had 10 secs to bail out   
---
But i was also distracted by the sudden kill and its loots. which led me to stay in arena eternally.   
---
Btw that deimos had 5 kill marks on him. rip 
---
First off, you probably should just give your IG for IG mail rather than your email. Then, check r/evejobs for corps ads.

Asset safety is a diseased crutch

You bastard, give him his 1 isk back.

eh,  As of 2015, none of CCP Games' original founders are still with the company.

so honestly, we really are in uncharted waters. as none of the original guides are left.

And yet when you ask any "CS" college student about what they want to do, they will say they wanna make gaymesssssss!!! You gotta be an absolute fucking idiot to want to go into this industry

Well hey, "adapt or die", right? Who knew it sucks to be "collateral damage"?
---
C'mon, you've got all of Horde to work with, you can figure something out until CCP fixes it. 
---
Assuming they ever fix it.

Sounds like he lost his mind instead.

Nice post

He hasn't did in a shitfit rorq or super, so he's good :^)

Yeah I should‚Äôve cautioned that darks, because of the speed bonus and the optimal penalty, fuck up drones ability to apply/track. Mixing rails with that probably would‚Äôve let you project better, but blasters meant you had to burn around even more so... Everything else doesn‚Äôt have the same sort of effect quite like that though. 
---
Oh look its Gallente apologists
---
KwG is shit. His are something else
---
One of my pilots only has 4mil. Two others around 100mil, another about 35mil. I have one pilot that acts as a banker, none of those are it.

Apparently.

Goats for love! 
---
I'm going to have to knockout down to a 10/10 from my original because no Dickbutt.
---
Come to Jita and go suspect on the undock again. 
---
But wouldn't that also prevent the proliferation if instead of some dude gate camping in his tackle ceptor and his carrier you would have to coordinate multiple people per capital ship.
---
Or people would just train multiple alts and fly their carrier with 3 alts instead of one.
---
That feeling when the art team puts out 90% of the updates for your game.
---
Worked in that industry and can say from my experience: Do NOT go there. Even if the job-description sounds great, the pay sounds "good for a start" to you or if the company has good reviews on employee-forums and such. Just dont. Its working with/for/around games, seeing all the bullshit the players dont even dream a company would do, have bosses that got in their positions for "knowing that single Dev that once made that one game the company started with" and no education else. It has zero fun in it.
---
Best update since 2003.
---
Looks cool. I thought it would be an interesting mechanic from those resource wars for some roids to suddenly get a little fiesty and provide better returns once in a while and provide visual feedback. Y'know, for the little guy to appreciate! 
---
I assume still well over 5mins a site
---
Its the romance of it. Making games, partying and having fun. When in reality it's usually shit hours and shit wages compared to other CS graduate jobs people can find
---
WTS Men's  Triglavian Survival Suit
---
Eve would make a perfect space opera. 
---
how many people work on monetization? 
---
You have to use a battle ship. I'd suggest tempest, cheapest by far
---
Let‚Äôs not try to rank renters, all entities who rent space from other players are equal renter trash, no exceptions.
---
Didn't anyone tell you I am doing serious campaign in the north called '' Simple Farmers 2.0 '' I can't come to JITA just yet.. I need finish this campaign first.
---
Could also be first day botting and settings not right
---
pls don't bully my cloakyloki ;-;
---
Let's be honest, there was a lot with abyssal, structures, general ship balance and events. Sure there wasn't a whole lot of updates towards things that reddit is crying about (mostly because those aren't one sided easy to implement updates).
---
Yea Then it Will. We are all excited and we all come from big alliances that we all left because of rules and stupid shit    so we are gonna do it better  
---
had some UK dude try to fight me because i called him a "funny cunt" once
---
good night
---
that looks p cool. hopefully it doesnt impact the fps too much. gj art team as always
---
&gt;Well hey, "adapt or die", right? Who knew it sucks to be "collateral damage"?
---
You could say the same thing about botting.  Handwaving serious issues as "part of the game" is simply signalling to CCP that they don't *need* to fix any of these things because you'll just keep subbing regardless.
---
I have not yet experienced the C2&gt;Null life, but i hear it is amazing
---
&gt; One of the most common patterns with hacked accounts is the mass extraction of skillpoints after a password reset request via a compromised email address.
---
&gt; As part of our drive to protect the accounts of our pilots and continue to enhance security, all EVE Online accounts will automatically be set to prevent skill extraction for a given period after a password reset request is completed.
---
Intended shitty potato video/ reposted after editting the misleading video title.
---
i didnt know i could save my pod at least :(
---
Description to whom doesnt understand
---
Abyssal pvp arena closes 30mins after the fight
---
and kills any pilots if they remain on grid.
---
As far as i know, a Curse is usually strong counter to cap stable deimos,
---
especially those blinged curse are almost unbeatable.
---
But i somehow managed to fight him until the very last moment.
---
After 30mins of fight, curse pilot realizes he cant kill me
---
and initiated self-destruction that i didnt notice. 
---
his curse was killed 10secs before the arena collapse
---
which means i still had 10 secs to bail out 
---
but i was also distracted by the sudden kill and its loots, led me to stay in arena eternally.
---
btw that deimos had 5 kill marks on him. rip
---
&gt; Why arent the concord baiters banned?
---
What is Concord baiting, exactly? Is it when people creating Concord-able actions in hi-sec in order to pre-load a grid with Concord?
---
spodbless u ccp
---
yea but it looks cool though
---
Oh, sorry. I didn't know it was serious. I didn't see many supers killed so I thought it was a joke. 
---
I‚Äôve been winning Eve for years now and have no complaints. Still enjoy stopping by the sub though
---
It's not has amazing as you can hear it, you get lots of empty space or Delve holes, but if you have a good rolling team you get a new hole quickly and they you can just randomly find that one rorqual sitting alone or an alliance with a response fleet you have a chance to fight and its really fun. We've had disappointing nights with absolutely no content despite rolls, but that's still a lot more action than elsewhere.
---
Holy shit can you read?
---
To be fair id rather the art team be doing 90% of the work cause everytime the other teams try something it breaks just think how broken eve would be if they did 90% if the work instead
---
&gt;It's  serious alright I have not even started yet.
---
When I do the big push Panfam will be calling an CTA.
---
This'll step on some disorganized toes, but definitely a great QOL change for the better
---
An redirect to the old URL of the API was turned off today as mentioned here: https://developers.eveonline.com/blog/article/removal-of-redirect-from-.tech.ccp.is-on-jan-7th
---
(everyone got a few days extra while I checked in with a few third parties :P)
---
However, it looks like there was an update to neocom pushed a few weeks back with an updated URL, based on this page: https://fnd.io/#/us/ios-universal-app/1257353838-neocom-ii-for-eve-online-by-artem-shiman
---
Any chance you've got a pending update for it in the app store?
---
Wow how much isk did you guys have on the field?
---
Why shouldn't you?
---
It's his money, he should be able to waste it however he wants. If we stop doing things just because people are stupid then that's the end of the human race.
---
I'll be watching ZKB with anticipation but low expectations. 
---
They'll come with Abyssal Mining.
---
reposted after editting the title.
---
trust me i was about to post this whole fight. about how to fight a curse in a cap stable deimos etc etc. 
---
but then this last 10 secs ruined everything, and made the fight humorous.
---
curse self-destructed 10 secs before the abyssal collape. 
---
i had chance to bail out, but i was distracted by the sudden kill and the loot. i got greedy and got killed by the arena as well. 
---
CSM9 took office May 9, 2014. I disconnected from the CSM channels used at that time the evening of May 12 right after publishing [this blog post](http://jestertrek.blogspot.com/2014/05/the-second-six-months.html).
---
So my NDA expires on May 13, 2019.
---
Ffs. 
---
I'd also recommend that you join one of the newbro friendly nullsec corps where you can mine the better stuff and learn more aspects of the game (I'm partial to recommending Brave because they are swell neighbors, but there's several others as well).
---
I know they were looking for a new director for it, but I couldn't say off the top of my head. 
---
Oh baby!
---
They should've blamed it on triglavian jamming technology or something, CCP been slacking recently ngl 
---
Thank you for the very kind words. :-)
---
ed are you alive? respond to us on discord, we're worried about your lack of dank memes :(

you need to show the new members the way of the harbinger

---
why are we not getting an actual account lock like botters get wtf
---
so if you want to secure your account the best way is STILL to bot, get banned for a few days and get free account protection 
---
He's a very brave person, haha
---
I thought this was already in place? 
---
they have always been powerful which is why they bubble up for interceptors... POOWWWAAAAAAA
---
You can use the same address.  You'll still get the rewards.  
---
This gives all the info: https://www.eveonline.com/recruit
---
Email address doesn't matter. The first set of rewards is once per recruit, and only if the purchases are made through the official website. If buying Omega from there for the first time, the account that referred you will receive the accels (purchase anything) as well as the plex (purchase omega).
---
The second set of rewards is for the number of recruits going omega. If this is your first recruit, you'll receive some clothes as well for the same purchase
---
This would be great. Make it also tied to using 2FA as well. 
---
I think its used to delay concord by spawning them somewhere away from the grid where the gank is going to happen.
---
Yea but atleast initially 
---
MY MOM SAYS I'M FPECIAL 
---
The lack of asset safety in wormholes is an excellent content driver. It helps things move and groups get stronger and weaker. I don't know mich about the agency thing though, I just blocked all the notifications and stuff related to it as it got on my nerves a bit.
---
Absolutely. Stay in low class C1-3, only go for pirate sites. Use T1 explo frig with nanos, core scanner I + sister core prones and a cloak. Always check D-Scan. YOu will die every few days but still make good money - and most importantly youll learn the ropes.
---
Great fight, thanks for bringing it
---
F
---
If you look at the description of the WH it will say "unknown space" for 1-3.  "Dangerous Unknown" for 4-5, and "Deadly Unknown" for 6.  You want the faction sites in 1-3.
---
Feel like you are keeping a dying game company afloat? Leave your basement. If you are part of the 25 human players left on EvE, there is a good chance you have purchased skins.
---
The change you want is another game that actually has ingame chat.
---
true
---
xix took insmother FOR tri, i was there; tri was f#####g aweful, wasnt until xix started in on it that systems started getting taken from red alliance.  
---
an amusing turn of fates i guess.  
---
maybe they will do better in pb... after theyve allied with imperium or some shit. not sure what theyre planning there tbh; looks like more of the same - going after tiny alliances to feed their ego and propoganda, eventually they will kill off anyone they can actually fight, blue the ones they cant; stroke their epeen too much and self destruct again taking on targets that are of equal number.  
---
because they are shit.  
---
though i must admit that is, in all likelyhood; only when its NOT garst in charge.  
---
i remember fighting garst in lowsec in small gangs and he at least actually seemed competant, though perhaps his way of choosing others to lead is not.  
---
Protip Garst, if the player has a totin or his nose shoved so far up your ass you cant feel it in your throat... this does not make them fc material..
---
Dunno mate. Maybe if you didn't require them to spend god knows how many man hours placating you when you went "REEE ISBOXERS REEE" we might have finished that and gotten a new client out. 
---
The fact that you're so salty for no apparent reason means that you probably did die to a gate camp. Your behavior is completely irrational.
---
&gt;Especially if they pick on a large alliance every day and make their life hell
---
I have been 36 rorq mining in delve for almost 2 years now. I'm stilling waiting to see this living hell you describe.
---
Not my best day:) Was in bad pod so no talizmans, anyway gf
---
Until the server shits the bed, rip 2bil
---
Damn it ... you know that they will make and burn altars wit your avatar picture while they are bored in wh space (aka always). 
---
not my best day too ))  
---
still it was good fight. yup
---
it was honestly fine for the 4 months i was there. we got bored and left because there was nothing left to do worth doing. fwiw, there are lots of groups that get endless, fun, independent pvp living in the same place for years.
---
i don't really have a problem with the sentiment of your posts, but it's full of inaccurate generalisations, and your corp history suggests that you either get bored quickly or fall out with people a lot.
---
unless you had the misfortune to join an endless streak of definitively bad corps/alliances, i don't see how you could have experienced all they had to offer. and if that did happen, i don't see how you could be in a position to advise people. 
---
Excellent change!       
---
We want more things like this!
---
Most likely. 
---
Thank fucking bob
---
&gt;This game needs to be great like it was in 2010-2013
---
This has nothing to do with the players, I think you need to be addressing CCP
---
Wow, old man wally went to bed like 30 minutes before this.
---
Races used to mean something but not anymore.
---
The drifters are estranged descendants of the Jovians.  While the Jovians are from K-space, the drifters emerged from a network of previously unknown wormholes, and nobody knows how long they were in there, or what they did while nobody was watching.
---
Dont mess with coconut crabs man!!!
---
There is an English Recruitment channel (in game) you can join. Just announce what you want and recruiters will be all over you.
---
Because CCP makes money off of skill extraction.
---
Excuse me, capsuleer. Do you have a moment to talk about our Lord and Savior, MOONPIRE?
---
"The best way to keep my bills paid is to go to prison"
---
This was it. Thank you. 
---
I mean, I said that gate camping is as boring as rorq mining, and answered an unrelated question about why I tidi.
---
What's irrational or salty about that?
---
And no, I've already stated that I've never died to a gate camp.  Literally never.
---
A guy in fweddit bought him, uses it for this thing called peeveepee
---
so..
---
what's a burst jammer?
---
Over a trilion. 
---
Wouldn't you just anchor citadels in an alt corp?
---
It's in the OP. Like right at the top.
---
It's also relevant.
---
God I hope that‚Äôs not his Eve sub email....
---
Yes.
---
yeup
---
Caps were fine until they decided to boost supers to ISK efficient levels, breaking with the design philosophy they had at the time. Which was ISK value should not determine strength.
---
&gt;implying we have subcaps in eso
---
all rorqs and titans, and 1 shield extender fit supers.
---
subs r gay.
---
(srsly tho for solo kiki are you using the 1 nano 3 heatsink or dcu+3heatsink? )
---
It was really sad to see their bs fleet dock and escape in pod. I love a good shit talk in local, but shit talking in pod is kinda yikes. 
---
To be fair... The Loki kill is more likely to make the rats kill board green after all...
---
I mean there are lots of options to get involved in more than f1 pushing in large alliances.
---
You can step up for roles like logi anchor or scouts, you can do intel work watching systems or following enemy fleets, you can fc smaller, independent fleets like chemo t3cs or bombers.
---
There is lots to do past just sitting in a mainline ship and hitting f1.
---
Ok well i removed the email address
---
That was dumb
---
Its not my eve sub email. What would my ingame mail be?
---
Fuck yeah finally literally came here to post a thread about this
---
ok guys here's my next idea
---
#make secure containers actually secure
---
Atm the owner of a secure container can reset the password at any time. 
---
Change this so secure containers have a "reset lock", configurable in the settings. You can't manipulate a secure container until you either enter the password, or wait for a 1-week or whatever timer to expire. 
---
This would let people with expensive speculative assets (or just hugeass hangars) protect most of their shit. 
---
**Another of the most common patterns in hacked accounts is fireselling all your shit for 30% of jita, and CCP is often not able to recover your stuff or isk.** Giving us a way to protect our assets would be helpful for players, reduce the amount of time CS needs to spend, and let those of us with huge speculative stockpiles sleep easier, knowing years of work won't be obliterated by a hacked email. 
---
Repost? :Clap:
---
Doesn't matter.  They have a dope poster.
---
Well it's Ibis Fleet, I wouldn't put it past them. 
---
&gt; You are a much better pilot then you think you are
---
Too much effort.
---
u can upvote this time. :D
---
So stop roaming there?
---
They drop carriers on you because they don't want you to have a good fight and don't want you to come back.
---
To be honest, they probably don't need more than that. Expand further into the Asian market (how is this game not super popular in China?) and focus on the main game.
---
TLDR; PanFam calls CTAs for uncontested citadels TEST could give two shits about, but avoids any real engagement and hasn't been able to destroy four Fortizars and numerous citadels in Oijanen, a few jumps from stagings. 
---
I kinda feel that the market is really open right now for someone to take the core EVE design and fix the many, many, *many* design mistakes CCP made over the years
---
This isn't about TEST; it's Sue's private war to anchor a citadel off the BWF gate so he can kill nerds in peace. If he gets one up, he won't drop the other 395 he has in hangers. Tell Gobbins to contact Sue directly to negotiate a deal. 
---
How does this affect character transfers? If you receive a character via character transfer, can you not extract that character for a period of time?
---
nestors are great but you cant really solo with them. in wh space nestors are typically remote rep so you need at least 2. im sure theres a fit that can do c3 stuff but its likely not a good idea. heres a decent starter fit for the rattle i pulled from the eve forums. what you can do is bring a mobile depot drop that while your running your site and refit based on the wave. but really i think the best thing you could do is just join a wh corp.

Now it will be even prettier.

I'm assuming it will be ties to your settings just like the asteroid environment is.

I ran a t1 with a ratting vector from when I couldn‚Äôt afford a VNI. They‚Äôre super easy

I try not to be toxic but sometimes the nulltards force my hand.

That‚Äôs what you get for being a family man.

just do a password reset every 7 days :shrug:
---
Alts are a different matter altogether and also IMHO not good for Eve as a game. They're only good for CCP and some players.
---
But but... muh SRP?!!!
---
lold poor horde
---
What about local? And the warp bug?????
---
i'd be excited, if it wasn't a given that these things will be overpriced.
---
Hey kids, do you want to spend 90% of your career working on projects that will probably never be greenlit by producers let alone ever see the light of day even if it is? Then head on down to ole Silicon Valley where you too can work 90 hour weeks for pennies on the dollar.

---
I'm not bitter.
---
I can finally be the space police I want to be!!! Too bad there isn't one for the erebus
---
I wonder of the price
---
lol
---
I've offline trained with Omega since before even Omega was a thing, so am very proficient on anything sub capital with the exception of T2 ships. I primarily have been a pve player in my history with the game and used a well trained Tengu for lv 4 missions.
---
Is there any benefit to the newer races (only trained Cal/Minn/Gal/Amarr) of ships for pve or would I be better off working on a Golem or other maurader? Or is there other new ships that fill the mission/exploration role better?
---
Bought the Kronos police skin. Week later they came out with the Megathron police skin. I'll pass.
---
But now how will I troll by leaving less than 100 units in the big rocks?
---
Ah
---
I enjoyed it. Nice mix of the video, comms, music, and graphics.
---
I guess but different people see it differently.
---
For me if I was only allowed to have one character I would have stopped playing EvE years ago. 
---
I have trust issues because 1.this world is full of fucked up people and 2. This world is full of unreliable mouth breathers. I prefer to live out of wormholes nomadically by myself. This play-style would be much harder to pull off successfully with only one character.
---
Imagine living in a WH with no scanning alt, no hauling alts, no hole control alt, data/relic alt, mining/huffing alt, etc...
---
Imagine doing all that on one character....
---
Alts are the least of this games worries right now.
---
They're busy Designing ships that look like bunnies.
---
695+
---
game of skins
---
Yeah, we weren't sure anything was gonna happen at first, since there were only two in Osti when we started.  Figured a few structure notifications would get people out of bed and looking around, lol.
---
I was ratting in nul-sec alone when I saw 1,800+ potential hostiles appear in system nearly instantaneously. I just about topped off the Home Depot shitter bucket I was sitting on. 
---
It was the Jita feed that had somehow been sent to my local system. 
---
calling it now; 250 for cruiser, 695 for nyx.
---
same as the last few rounds of skins.
---
Idk man. I've actually read up on economies at scale and I know what fun and what isn't. 
---
Step 1: Eve needs to consolidate its code most of all. Debug, analyze and UNFUCK it. Hire some assembly gurus and just un fuck it all. 
---
Step 2: Get rid of bots. This really should tie in with step 1.
---
Step 3: Tweak play so it's profitable to fly smaller groups against large alliances. Big block alliances are boring. Get over it. 
---
Step 4: Enhance current content. 
---
Step 5: Add new content that enriches lore. 
---
5 year project plan right there. 
---
shut up retard
---
That's another heavily romanticized destination for the fizzbuzz studiers. I guess let them have their containment zone of misery
---
So it is, I had already forgotten. I mostly skimmed the OP.
---
Potato potato potato potato
---
Oh you're *that* guy
---
Sounds like lowsec isn‚Äôt dead, wtf 
---
For optimum TL;DR shit posting its bests a followup TL;DR to the original TL;DR post be shorter.  
---
Ya know. I've been reporting the cloaky campers as botters for a long time now. I'm glad to see others are waking up to the fact that no human being is capable of logging in 100 accounts seconds after downtime, without fail, every day. 
---
deleting wormholes would solve yet another issue
---
Well, that's somewhat mitigated by the 10 hour wait that's already in place, the fact that it costs $$$ or PLEX to initiate, and that CCP generally reviews character transfers before approving IIRC.
---
Stain guy! It‚Äôs been too long dude! They‚Äôre gonna make the gate!
---
Interesting point, since they have the mechanism to put a cooldown on a character after a password change I wonder how hard it would be to apply it to transfered characters. With probably a larger cooldown, say 30 days.
---
Or a character transfer cooldown after a password reset.
---
Umm, no. The best way to secure your account is to use 2FA on both your account and email. 
---
Deliberately trying getting a temporary ban for botting is ... unwise imo. I'll give an example, what happens if while your botting away waiting for your ban, CCP changes to a zero tolerance policy for botting and you get caught?
---
How are you supposed to read Regional Market's volume? Does the quantity/order meter mean how many products have been bought, sold or how many offers were completed?
---
You mean you don't enjoy looking for investors and asking for 50 million for an app that does literally nothing because you have nothing but a concept and a dream?
---
This largely checks out, Valk would know a good fall when we sees one.
---
It's endearing, honestly. 
---
Maybe he should cause some more chaos.
---
So now the people who do this will instead just drain your character's head before resetting the password and reset it immediately after that.
---
nahhhh
---
Don't forget about the "forgotten" sites as well...those are a "no no" for t1 frigates. So mind the "forgotten and unsecured" sites, those are sleeper sites.
---
I've found teaching newbros to fight and hunt has been a lot of fun. To each their own, and I do remember scalding pass tactical madness days with you harassing us motivating me a whole lot to hunt in null.
---
Nice to see stig still around. In that case. Fuck Mark. Eat shit xsanatos and all Hail LEX comrades. 
---
ok
---
Inb4 they delete the container
---
Dude, it's a 500mil structure that isn't even anchored yet. Comeon.
---
I wish these skins weren‚Äôt so pricy. I‚Äôd buy multiple skins for my ships if they were priced between ¬£2-¬£5
---
What he said \^\^
---
Great point.  The point of making plans is a lot of times is the thought process of it.   The if thens.       This way when things don't go as planned which is what will happen you have an idea of what you can do and do not want to do.    
---
Your second point is also awesome in game and life.   A bad call made early enough can be recovered from.   But if you wait for the perfect call even it might be to late.  Opportunities  are usually on a timer.  
---
May I ask for a copy/paste for the inconveniently firewalled?
---
How on earth do you figure that? Didn't realise you had a feeling'o'meter and could actually tell if someone was laughing at something or fake laughing... 
---
Also i love the "you are butthurt" nah just trying to understand things. 
---
Lol problem is that I enjoy the Corp I'm in, or at least the people in it
---
Location is everything, and sometimes saying gf in local and convoing them about it after is all it takes to make it a game and not a revenge story
---
doesn't matter what changes they do.
---
i doubt you'd undock to shoot it anyway.
---
Kids these days...

&gt; I‚Äôd buy multiple skins for my ships if they were priced between ¬£2-¬£5
---
so, about a quarter of the price they are now.
---
They're talking about a podcast you gigantic retard.
---
Yeah but at the moment I buy 0 if they were priced like I said I‚Äôd have bought 10 by now easy. 
---
Huh? If you're away from the PC then not having local makes no difference.
---
I'm totally with you on that one.
---
some of the skins are pretty cool, but they'll never be good enough to justify the prices they're trying to sell them at.
---
The advantage is that taking it off cluster reduces load on the main cluster so it should make the core gameplay scale better in big fights.
---
Not surprised Space Pigs use drone boats...
---
&gt; The reduced bots is due to logistics involved in earning income. Looting field and transporting to kspace for sale is a big speedbump for bots.
---
Not sure how true this is, but there's an obvious answer to some of the null problems. Remove bounties in nullsec (why does Concord care about stuff in null anyway?), replace it with tags that have an NPC buy order in empire space (like blue loot).
---
At least then you can hunt people's MTUs and take their stuff if they run at the first sight of a ship in local.
---
Exactly, I‚Äôm not a cheapskate, I have no problem spending a good amount of my disposable income on games but I want value for money. 
---
Even if they were account bound and only available for a small amount of time, actually in certain circumstances I‚Äôd prefer this. 
---

CCP are no longer catering the game for high energy autistic pvpers ( this is not intended as an offense I am one also) despite the fact these are the players that made eve such a fantasticly unprecedented world. The trend I have observed is too cater towards low energy average folk who are more likley to base their individual success on skins and assets, not on meaningful player interactions.  CCP is making more money than they ever have if I remember correctly so I guess it makes sense but I think it will kill the long term health of the game (we are already seeing the effects).
---
;)
---
Most miner's aren't watching the rocks, they're watching netflix lol
---
This made me smile, I like you
---
Yeah... imagine living like that, having enough corpmates to do things as a team... I mean, sure, I know where you're coming from and I get that some things would be very hard to pull off without an alt and others would simply suck donkey dick from a player's perspective. Nevertheless, I think alts shouldn't be a thing or at least there should be a precise limit on alts, like 2 or 3 logged in at the same time. Being a one-man orchestra is fun for some but I'm of the opinion that if your opponent has 10 alts then to match him, you too need 10 alts. Just as it was with off-grid links - having them was just too big of an advantage.
---
It's a good start but we should be able to request a lock that always applies until we write to CCP and ask them to remove it, which should take at least 7 days. When you realise your account is stolen and try to reset your password it may be too late.
---
I never want to extract my main and probably never will.
---
I was in Feign disorder for 400+ days at a time. I basically ran it, it was amazing.
---
We went to join forces with other groups in GWCS by creating a new alliance, thus a new corp called Feign-Disorder
---
I took a break for a bit, after we joined black legion, and when i took a break there was noone in Feign-Disorder to take the reigns, so people joined Origin.
---
I joined Origin after my break, and after 14 days of that it just didnt mesh well with me. I left to join Stimulus.
---
Everything before Calamitous-Intent was me finding my footing in eve. From joining lowsec groups, to WHers to nullsec gate campers, i tried a lot.
---
Calamitous-Intent was the place i felt most at home, and i took that gameplay style and owned it.
---
Not everyone joins a group they love right off the bat. Also, changing your play style is the natural progression of gaming. Maybe after 2 years you dont want to be doing the same thing.
---
You need a new meme.
---
I think you are misunderstanding the order of events. The password reset is used to gain access to the account in the first place, so they can't pull out the SP without doing that first.
---
How this looks in the wild is:
---
1. Your email account becomes compromised because of an old password you are reusing that got stolen from some other site, or social engineering, or whatever.
---
2. Malicious users request a password reset on your EVE account, which generates a token that is sent to your (compromised) email.
---
3. Malicious users use the token to reset the password to something they know and now have access to your EVE account. Theft ensues.
---
Of course they are making more money, they cancelled all their stupid projects no one gave a shit about.
---
It's really not.  Hop in a couple of boats, head to the higher pop lowsec hubs, you'll get some action.  Learn who the locals are in various places, do the intel work, and you can get fights at almost any scale you want.
---
yeah, one with 3 days of 2 reinforcement timers and then low power with a long ass reinforcement timer.
---
with damage caps. they not worth bothering. which makes evicting or removing persistant enemies a matter of waiting till one side gets bored of bashes.   cause actually killing them faster than they replaced is impossible T.T
---
thats what happens when you join a first time FC fleet xD
---
I think when compared in a vaccum modern eve still makes more money than peak sub count which was around 2010-2011.
---
they could do the same in subcaps if ccp wasn't too busy catering to ppl who are averse to pvp. 
---
it's also a vast majority of nullsec lul fuck off spodlord
---
They are also very nice in Keres / maulus if you can fit them. 
---
When you are kiting around a fight damping targets it will auto lock people who may shoot at you so you can make them drop you as a target with your damps, then continue on doing what you were doing.
---
Essentially its a high slot that can, in a way, up your "survivability"
---
Yup, lowsec for life ) black rise forever 
---
Showing up just to confirm :wink:
---
indeed
---
Yeah it has a bad reputation and I think deservedly so. Tbh what I've heard of CCP makes it sound like, for a games studio, they're actually great.
---
Intentionally being jailed is a common tactic used by the severely impoverished in the US when desperate, because it guarantees a warm bed to sleep in and meals.
---
Stay outta my belts
---
Not all of us missed this. And many ignored it and just blamed the remaining devs still.
---
If bots use these SKINs, who pulls them over?
---
(Ironic in context that the VNI wasn't included.)
---
It does, as you put one of the smaller kids (that still listen to you) in front of monitor and say - "if something changes yell loud :D"
---
"These pretzels are making me thirsty."
---
So you wanna run rorqs in null, but you don't pvp and you want free space to live happily ever after in? Lol.
---
No doubt CODE. pushed for this effect to keep miners even more distracted.
---

These guys know how to get a man to drop a pitchfork.  Gimme dat sweet, sweet free SP.
---
The damage cap is there so you can't just dreadbomb a structure in a single siege cycle with no counterplay (or any other method of excessive DPS). It forces the attackers to actually hold the grid for a minimum amount of time.
---
I can see why someone would dislike that mechanic in general, but I don't see why it should be different for anchoring structures specifically. It's still a timer you're supposed to be able to defend.
---
not if only they did this with the new probe scanning/ probing interface
---

---
This. Why do they keep on half assing shit.
---
I like the phrase "at least"  
---
It took them 10 months to realize the new chat system is fucked.
---
At least they realized the new chat system is fucked.    
---
#Because Wormholers told CCP not to include asset saftey!!!
---
it probably has less active players logged in, but more active subscriptions.
---
skill farming has pretty much removed the need to do any creative accounting when year end rolls around, i'm guessing.
---
it's really interesting how long it took for this decision to come out. "yeah it's fucked we're even rolling back if we can't fix it". now that's a big acknowledgement for any project.

This is a cap-stable, neut resistant C3 snake. It'll comfortably run any site including data and relic sites with high skills, for a couple of the data and relic sites you'll need to be careful with triggers otherwise you may be in trouble.

If you switch the invulns over to pith-c and change to cruise launchers, it'll do C4 anoms but not data and relic sites. 
---
In general C4 sites are a ballache and not worth the hassle, everything spawns far away and the payout isn't really worth it for the extra time and isk you need to put on field. 
---
I intentionally used the kinetic missile since it probably made the most sense. I considered using iron charges from a 425mm gun but there were too many unknowns, especially the actual velocity (which is essentially instant damage in eve but even if you say less than 1 second to go 250km that is still absurd)  
---
It's fun to think about until you realize the devs probably didn't give it as much thought as you are.
---
so it was a 2 year contract or...? 
---
They are superior in power to you, so they can dictate how you are able to fight in their space.
---
HTFU or get over it, this is eve not hello kitty island.
---
This is a poorly thought response. Of course players should be able to interact and siege a structure if possible in a few minites. This is EVE a game designed to foster open ended player interactions, not stifle potential. The counter to a fast siege is a timer which defenders have options to set.
---
Leave a cloaked ship on your static while recording and analyze the footage when you have time. Good security footage goes a long way for intel for both evictors and evictees. 
---
Have a bunch of emergency freighters so you can fill them with valuable stuff and logoff during eviction. Try not to have more stuff than what you can fill.
---
How many of that item have been bought/sold. 
---
if by canceled you mean are making 2 chinatastic mobile games, sure 
---
That level of output until you hit seriously high number does represent power in the form of how big of caches of ships are available in any fight.    
---
I believe progod stated not long ago tossing away 400 person dread bombs once a month was sustainable for Test 
---
What if you could do do it four times a month. 
---
Making ships more disposable should at some point should reduce risk adversity.   Since it is already replaced.  
---
We definitely were not sitting and waiting for a Test BS fleet outnumbering us 3-1 to jump a gate into us and get into a fight, only to get pods coming at us.
---
it's anchoring and it's a 15 minute timer regardless
---
if it's being defended, the defense is already there 
---
That is a nuclear option if I ever saw one. Glad they are not doubling down like a lot of other companies would, even though this took far too long to be addressed.
---
WOOP WOOP
---
At least they know what they're doing.
---
please post BR with loss mail.
---
Ok so lets think about this for a moment. The person anchoring the structure knows at what time it's going to anchor. So step #1. I have to find the anchoring structure, and setup for the timer. You the defender know this ahead of time. You'll also notice I said ONLY medium structures (Astrahaus, Raitaru, etc). They are 500-800mil to purchase. So if the attacker wants to drop 10 billion isk on it to kill it quickly, why is that an issue? They are risking 15x the value of the target.
---
&gt;My gut feel is that there's far too much apathy about the Imperium's position for a war against them to get started.
---
That's really too bad, because "everything becoming Goons" is far worse for the game than "Horde being shit for new players".
---
This feels like a win/lose/lose situation. Im hopeful they can sort it out with these new updates. As that is the only win here.
---
Otherwise, it feels like they've lost valuable dev time, that could have been used for other things during this whole fiasco, and then on-top of that, have to spend more time repurposing old chat just to have a stable chat system again. Which also means, they will probably try "Chat Feature 2.0" sometime in the future, which adds additional dev time.
---
I do applaud CCP for trying, the intentions were good. If this fails and we go back to old chat though, i'd like to see CCP try to focus on working on the low hanging fruit. Between citadels, abyss, 64bit, chat, every "feature" implement just feels like an overburden on already thin resources. Would be nice, if they have to reset chat, to take 1-3 months and knock out the small stuff or address some of the larger balance issues before diving back into the feature cycle.
---
I assume you check the market websites?
---
i'd be fine with that tbh the skin looks baller as fuck
---
lol dudes getting hard to shoot citadels for kms.......this game dead
---
At least, at last, a solid statement. Appreciate it. 
---
‚ÄúWe fires all our devs who know how to fix xmpp related issues so our remaining hamsters have no idea how to fix what‚Äôs wrong, if these interns don‚Äôt figure it out by Jan we‚Äôre just go back lol‚Äù
---
good to see that wally learned so much from fighting ebola in great wildlands :D
---
I am not sure whats more amazing - the incompetence of a company like CCP or the fact that the player base is mesmerized into submission by SKINS - like a cat distracted by the jingling keys of its master
---
If you don't want to be dreadbombed drop a Fortizar not an Astrahus or Raitaru, it's that simple. An Astrahus worth about half of the price of a single T1 dread, I don't see any reason it can stand the fire power of 15 dreads for over 5 minutes.
---
Even removing the damage cap, the attacking side need to control the grid for over 5 min to make sure they can extract their 30b worth of dreads, just in exchange of a 900m citadel. Even that is some unfairly high risk for the attacker.
---
That's his point. NC is having to chase down and undo one persons autism citadel spam. Someone is investing less than 5 minutes to anchor a structure to make someone else waste at least 30 minutes to kill it. 
---
Oh shit all these forts we have don't actually exist...
---
The devblog makes no mention about skins and no one here has mentioned skins before you.
---
it's not that special, there are better skins - and i wouldn't pay 250 for those either.
---
Something tells me you dont live in wormholes, if you are active and give fights instead of docking up and hiding, talking shit and doing duchebag stuff people will respect you, and if you are active and go toe-to-toe with any agressors, people wont consider evicting you becuse you are a clearly competent group that could twart an eviction attempt.  
---
People call it "Wormhole Bushido" but it is natural way of thinking.
---
One step closer to asteroid killmails....
---
You just need to have your name in game listed, people can search the name, right click, send mail (can't remember the exact term in game)
---
I'll be honest, as egregious and off-pissing it was that it took CCP *ten* freaking months to realise that the new chat backend was failing, I'm glad that they realised it in the first place.
---
Admittedly I feel that giving themselves until the end of January to fix ejabberd seems a bit short of a time given how keen and invested they were into fixing it, but I guess CCP want a way out of this mess, at least for a good few years if they want to revisit it eventually.
---
&gt; so they can dictate how you are able to fight in their space.
---
no they can't. the developers that balance application of weapons systems do u goddamn rube lmfao
---
Just remove local! :D
---
Right, I do live like that, and I prefer it. Imagine logging into the game and not being able to do a dam thing because no one else in my corp is on at that time. Or like working a job/having a life that allows you to play sporadically and inconsistently so you can't rely on being available to support your corp on a predictable basis.
---
Playing by myself with my alts is the easiest way to avoid all of that. Instead of having to figure it out and depend on others I depend on myself and get whatever I work for. Some things will be easier to coordinate on my own and some much much harder but nonetheless I get by and I do so without having to depend on other people which I find the majority to be unreliable.
---
Different strokes for different folks. 
---
My play style doesn't break the game or give any unfair advantage, why outlaw it. 
---
For the Dudes who cant access the DevBlog: 
---
&gt;Since the deployment of the new chat backend with the March 2018 release, we‚Äôve seen a wide range of issues with the new system that have both severely inconvenienced the community and had long term adverse effects on gameplay for many of our pilots.
---
At this point in time, given that feedback from the community is crystal clear regarding issues that are still being experienced ten months after deployment, we feel that it‚Äôs imperative to provide an update on the status of the chat issues to give a little more clarity.
---
Overhauling the chat system is a very important part of the futureproofing work that‚Äôs going into many of the older systems in EVE and over the course of the next three weeks, we‚Äôll be looking at finalizing its stabilization with a view to resolving all the major outstanding issues. Finding a fast, effective and permanent resolution to these issues is now a top priority for the development team.
---
If our current efforts do not yield positive results by the end of January, we‚Äôll begin the process of investigating the reinstatement of the original chat back end, which despite its future limitations, served New Eden reliably in the past.
---
While we aim to have the issues resolved as soon as possible one way or another, reinstatement of the original chat back end will take some time given that settings, permissions and content will need to be migrated back to the old system again and several technical changes need to be made to bring it back online.
---
As soon as we have more information on the progress of our current efforts, we‚Äôll keep you updated via the @EVE_Status twitter handle. Once we reach the end of January you can expect more details from us on a final decision regarding the chat system, as well as in-game compensation for the disruption to gameplay that has occurred due to the issues that have been experienced.
---
We would like to sincerely apologize for the issues that the community have experienced with reliability of the chat system, and for the completely unacceptable length of time that it is taking to bring stability to chat, which is a fundamental part of gameplay in New Eden. We hope to have the issues resolved as soon as possible.
---
fine - make it easier for people to destroy any structures NC. i doubt the people that have no problem killing anchoring structures will object to it being made even easier for them.
---
I'm glad they're finally addressing it with a defined timescale, but I'm still at a loss for what the issue is here. It's not like this is some experimental in-house tech, XMPP and ejabberd are 15 years old, extremely mature and used the world over in countless applications. It's not even like this is a legacy thing, they're both about the same age as EVE itself. I can only imagine what a mess the EVE client codebase if its so difficult to integrate something so widely used and supported.
---
or you just bot, get banned for a bit, and your account is locked from extracting forever, no chance of parole.
---
perfect protection for botters from getting hacked, but for paying customers? pah. 
---
It will hurt for people multiboxing 40 rorqs
---
Why do you keep halfassing your passwords? Or enabling a 2FA via an external app for your mail accounts?
---
Been broken 10 months... We can fix it in three weeks.......
---
The problem there is. If everyone but the bots quits. Who are the bots RMT'ing to.. The bots will leave to ;)
---
I'm going to start an elite tactical SWAT Nyx roaming group.  You're welcome to join.
---
I'm  always interested when people say that these skins are overpriced and that it's insulting. What is it about the price that is insulting? I know that one capital sized skin &gt; the cost of one month subscription, however, it's a one time purchase and it doesn't give any benefits. It's good looking. That's it. It takes some isk away from the game, albeit a very small portion, ccp earns around 28 USD per skin (capital sized) and you get a fancy new look for the ship you fly. I'm aware that other games offer cheap additions for avatars, etc., but what else is it that you think is insulting? Imo, I get a new skin and ccp adds some money to the bank. Since I love this game I find it am equitable investment. My way of chipping in a tip. 
---
I think u mean serenity? The Chinese server?
---
So you target a rock and just sit on that rock? And get a higher output for not moving? That‚Äôs already current mining
---
Very good reply thank you 
---
something something 2fa? so unless they also steal your phone, they can do jack?
---
Not saying that what they've done isn't good. It's just 2fa seems to be the best answer period.
---
&gt; what else is it that you think is insulting?
---
literally the price point.
---
Finally a good use for my nyx. It's been collecting dust for a hot minute. 
---
&gt;that dude that doesn't LARP as a police officer when ganking jf's or small gangs
---
If you can‚Äôt make friends, dual box an alt and station camp in an instalock arty thrasher 5km directly behind undock. Shoot leopards as they undock, scoop loot with alt. Still get ass mads too.
---
What about ice rocks?
---
What would you find a reasonable price point? Items in eve are historically expensive. A way of slinging a giant e-peen around. You can pay via in-game currency so you don't have to spend rl money on it if you don't want to. I know I'm on repeat, i just want to understand. It took time for an artist to render the skin and as such I don't mind paying for that. 
---
Hhehehehehe
---
as if dudes with 16 rorq alts on a single rig dares to switch any of the clients off potato mode
---
&gt;as if anyone would notice since like, who the fuck is ever zoomed in that close to their ship unless you're spinning it?
---
Did Mittani ask you to write this? It will be that much easier for Goons to dominate if everyone leaves their 800 man alliance.
---
CCP could not fix the chat system within almost a year and they decided to go back to the old one...?
---
WTF
---
Wait what...
---
Welp. I'm retarded. 
---
I ignored the kronos police skin but got the megathron skin.       
---
3 skins that i bought - due to reason that i actually wanted them :           
---
* Quafe thanny       
---
* Police mega       
---
* Matigu (this caldari command destroyer that i never fly)         
---
Now this nyx looks interesting - if the price will be good. 
---
You mean after 10 months I might actually get my local and corp chat back????
---
Afaik technically you're not supposed to but everyone does and I've never heard of anyone being disciplined for it
---
I just euthanized my cat. Very similar to what I did to my Eve apps and subs
---
https://www.eveonline.com/article/pl2ufa/update-on-chat-system-issues seriously patience is a virtue 
---
I'm glad too. Sometimes being able to admit you fucked up and walk things back is the right choice. 
---
The old chat was NEVER this bad, at least as a temp. fix a revert would be a good solution.
---
Yeah.     I'm just glad not only did they acknowledge the issue,   they put in a timeline to resolve it.  
---
What was wrong with the chat system?, i never really noticed anything apart from the "no local" when they first deployed it.
---
While the T&amp;Cs say this:  "The Recruitment Program is intended to encourage players to invite new players to join EVE Online. Violating the purpose of the Recruitment Program in any way or form is prohibited.", I'm sure you won't be the only one doing it. Kind of a grey area, I'd say
---
Why in the lore big ships have longer lock times?
---
I don't think this is exclusive to the US.
---
/u/ccp_falcon Is there any reason you guys can't just bring back the local capsuleer list aspect of Local from the prior chat system? That would alleviate most of the aggravation folks have with the system having issues (in k-space of course). 
---
Turn off auto notifications and Move out of jspace if no asset safety bothers you. Fucking carebear.
---
I'm okay with the current 85% functioning chat system if we keep getting free skill points every now and then
---
For all the effort everyone in EvE puts out trying to keep the gave alive, they would be better off just banding together and kickstart a new game. EvE 2.0 (of course another name would be used for said game), which has nothing to do with CCP.
---
Username checks out.
---
and still no luck on rolling back the Rorqual changes \^^
---
I like their solution better.  People who regularly use skill extraction would still like the protection their idea provides without screwing up how we use extraction normally.
---
Can an alpha clone do invention?
---
do you enjoy being retarded or is it just an unfortunate side effect of being dropped on your head?
---
Nice! That makes if free right?
---
&gt;You can pay via in-game currency so you don't have to spend rl money on it if you don't want to.
---
literally irrelevant, since the value of plex doesn't suddenly change because you obtained it in a different way - in fact give how long it takes to grind in-game currency, paying with it that way makes it even less attractive as your time isn't free.
---
time? look at most of the skins dude, it's 2 random colours and a flashing light at most. so few of the skins even look like they've had much effort put in to them. even the ones that do look like some one has spent a bit of energy on it, still aren't worth the price ccp are charging - it's an irrelevant cosmetic and one that has so many limitations on it that it lowers the value proposition even more.
---
i stated in my other post what i'd be willing to pay, and what would open my wallet further.
---
based
---
Are you sure that's what you want? We'd welcome our lead on supercap having being permanently cemented.
---
I love it plan comes together
---
Mr Capsuleer, I don't feel so good
---
This is option for people who value safety and less on people who extract at all since youll extra if your selling toon or quiting OR its SP farm toon
---
The fact that chat is breaking separately while the rest of the game chugs along fine implies that the chat system itself is hosted separately. I think it's hosted on AWS, even? Don't remember for sure. There's probably some sort of issue communicating between the Eve monolith and the chat service, or one or the other has poor failover, or something like that.
---
&gt;Because content and fun
---
Chasing 'content' with no point or plan gets an alliance ending up a hollow shell pet like Triumvirate.
---
How do you guys run DED sites? I've heard something about bookmarking something then warping off to wait for the rats to despawn to collect the loot. Can anyone explain the process to me please?

Because in game lore for comms says it's done via quantum entanglement, so in theory it links your ship/pod back to empire regardless of where you are.

I was hoping for more info actually.  You know a bit more tech detail on what the problem is.  It's interesting apart from anything else.

I wouldn't say the game chugs along fine, there is many other problems that players deal and live with each day but the chat mess is currently the worst at the moment

Because then you'd enable extraction and then when your account is hacked, you're not protected. While I agree a setting to disable extraction outright would be nice as well, that and the original implementation addresses two different threat.
---
It'd be nice to have both. That way your account is also protected if someone gains your current password.
---
Good
---
&gt; while the rest of the game chugs along
---
ehhhhhhhhhhhh
---
Varies for each site. There are many different ones. For most of them though when you get to the final room you can headshot the ‚Äúboss‚Äù, bookmark the loot and then warp out and wait for despawn. Once the rest of the site despawns warp back to the loot and grab it and off you go. 
---
You shouldn't need extra skills. If you can fly all tech 1 ships, you can fly all the pirate faction stuff. The Rattlesnake is the best and most frequently used PvE ship pretty much along with the Tengu albiet less so. The Sisters of Eve ships are great for explo. Since you can't really fly tier 2 stuff (seriously how do you train for years and not get proficient t2 skills) the Astero and Stratios can fit a covert ops cloak and have hacking and scanning bonuses. If you are wondering about the Triglavian ships, you need new skills named 'precursor' frigate, etc. The triglavian ships, sadly, have not found their place yet. They seem to do fleet PvP well and drekavacs are sometimes used in incursions but that's all I know about their usage. 
---
Sure, but the two aren't tightly coupled. If the chat service eats shit, the game doesn't necessarily and strictly eat shit along with it. That's all I'm trying to say.
---
I am well aware; however, I will stick by my assertion that, at least in the United States, there is no way to compel a private individual who lives in the United States, and hosts a website in the United States, particularly one that in not engaged in commerce with EU Citizens, to comply with the GDPR. 
---
Of course, in this case the person in question is Canadian, and this makes my knowledge less certain; however, my best guess would be that the same applies. 
---
The Guristas Ships fill this role pretty well, the Rattlesnake is among the most flown ratting ships. The Angel Machariel can also be fitted for blitzing L4 Security missions well.
---
While a Golem will serve you very well, and is probably still one of the best choices, you may just want to give the others a shot and see if you can have some fun flying them. 
---
Yeah it's AWS and I'm sure it's something along those lines. My point is like, there's probably dozens of case studies of people doing similar things with the same technologies you could look at to see what problems they had and solutions they came up with. The more time you spend building software the more similarities you tend to notice. Always be wary of people claiming they are the exception.
---
Better late than never.
---
&gt; I can only imagine what a mess the EVE client codebase if its so difficult to integrate something so widely used and supported
---
You don't want to know.
---
as a matter of fact, at least one dev (CCP Snorlax) who was working on the new chat system, has left the company in September last year: https://twitter.com/CCP_Snorlax/status/966336162855047168
---
But when accounts get leaked, typically passwords are leaked as well. Then you can just try all the passwords that user has had in the past to see if they've been reused in EVE. There's no need to reset the password in that scenario.
---
No, I am talking about the public test server, Singularity.
---
January of what year? 
---
If someone gets your current password, you've already screwed up.
---
Enable 2FA, use [good password practices](https://keepass.info/)  and don't get hacked in the first place.
---
I'm not necessarily against the toggle option, but if you need it you've already screwed up twice.
---
You do know there is actually a proper version? https://youtu.be/KwY28rpyKDE?t=2
---
Great fight guys and thanks for dropping by our neighborhood. When your HIC landed on our ranged dreads, I think I woke my room mate up yelling lol. 
---
AAR is 100% accurate and well written to how the fight went.
---
If you want to fight just ask in local next time üòé 
---
Looking forward to Future engagements in the future for sure! 
---
&gt; If someone gets your current password, you've already screwed up.
---
No question about that. Could happen though, like a "friend" using your computer or something.
---
People who value safety don't use their email password for their EVE accounts.
---
yes daddy!
---
not gonna lie that i would not be mad if they rolled back the server to ca. 2006
---
Guess he payed a lot of ppl to be silent. 
---
Inb4 February release brings back old chat system but with current issues.
---
Bot for a day, then confess and accept "punishment".
---
It's not lost on me that you're channeling Heath Ledger's Joker, by the way.
---
I don't have a corp. I gave up on that noise long before it became publicly evident that there were only 5 or so corporations declaring war on literally everything that moved. I put real hours into what I own in New Eden, and if these IRL incel cucks want a piece of me or my property, they're damn sure going to have to work for it.
---
But I digress. You didn't answer the question. Are you or are you not advocating awoxing?
---
Because if you are, I'm calling you out as an unironic fucking dick on par with James314 and you need to about-face and forward march your ass right on out of here right fucking now if that's the case.
---
This backstabbing horseshit is a big part of what's killing this game. There has to be SOME integrity, or new blood is just going to turn right back around and go back the way they came.
---
Don't quote me on this and take this with a heavy grain of salt, but *supposedly* their issues are caused by the way they decided to handle presence updates for not-jabber-connected-players.
---
I wouldn't be so sure that there are case studies at all, actually. While I'm very sure it's not a unique problem, I am also relatively sure that the people who have suffered it have been companies operating closed-source, proprietary applications. If so, they'd be operating under significant incentive NOT to talk freely about how they solved their problem, lest they erode some sort of competitive advantage.
---
It's all mostly conjecture, anyways. The playerbase doesn't have the means to assist in the matter.
---
This^ 
---
They also don‚Äôt use a google doc to save their account passwords. 
---
Hey look a devblog attempting at communication they should have done months ago but chose not to but only decided to because the past week has been nonstop shitting on CCP for failure to fix local and other bugs!
---
Cool
---
Maybe I‚Äôm missing something, but how would having a third-party do the chat help with future proofing EVE? And how would reverting to the original system hamper that, as they mentioned? 
---
I only get rewarded if you eventually go omega but honestly that's not even the biggest reason I offer.
---
I've found with friends I've tried to get into Eve recently that the 250,000 SP really helps them learn the skill menu and what kind of basic skills they need. Also it feels rewarding as hell as a newbro to knock 10 days off that first 30 day skill plan you find.
---
Mandatory 2FA.
---
Secure Hangers with mandatory unique password. Not just containers.
---
For those of us security conscious irl, these would be a bare minimum if we had hangers, let alone containers.
---
I think you watch too many movies or something.  There might be some weirdo out there who did this, but calling it "common" is pretty ridiculous.
---
There's a petty gang of three or four multiboxers who all have supercapitals, and they blap anyone and anything that moves in the main gathering spot on the test server, which is also the "free for all combat system."
---
They're exploiting a loophole in the rules to outright ruin the privilege of using the test server for everyone not in their little clique-y test server empire.
---
That would be bad enough, but they're also unabashed hypocrites.
---
The text and pictures don't really make it clear - does the rock slowly disintegrate as you pull the m3, or is this new effect in just the instance it dies? 
---
That's the one.
---
HK has a bad rep, and if they were smaller they would have been evicted ages ago, but they are not, before the eviction they were the largest, richest and most powerful corp in wormholes. Today they still carry a big stick, and with Lazer Noobs being on good terms with them you would need 1500 goons to kick them to the curb. ^^^^^^inb4 ^^^^^^flair ^^^^^^baited
---
Well, in 2016 CCP played all its trump cards to boost revenue: At the end of 2015 they released skill trading (a goldmine for CCP), in 2016 the citadel expansion (mainly for the vets) AND the F2P expansion (to gain new players). 
---
their studio is in fucking iceland. trust me it all balances out to shit and misery
---
Nah, they'll be like fuck we underpriced it. Let throw couple of hundreds on top of next skins to compensate loss. 
---
Imagine having local just in stations, oh the beauty of a working, not really existing local. :) 
---
Knew Richie back in the slightly sexual days in outer ring. 
---
Good group of dudes. Sorry we broke up the coalition.  
---
And the saddest part is, the fucking Beavis/Butthead types that are a part of the test server empire pulling this horseshit relish the idea of driving people away. They're unapologetic trolls and by all rights they deserve a permanent ban from the server, but CCP has neither the time, the manpower, nor the inclination to properly moderate their test server.
---
wtf i love ccp now
---
inbefore china only 
---
So, someone's aunt and uncle has to die (in-game) before we get anywhere.
---
I dont think so. EVE devs were moved to their mobile games quite a while ago. 
---
Finally. About fucking time. But for real, don't do shit like this again. 10 months is unacceptable. 
---
yeah, this. definitely owning it, and it's timely as i think even the most patient among us were begin to get frustrated. 
---
That's a solid, respectful statement from CCP, glad to see they are taking it on the chin rather then running from the issue. 
---
Shut up and take my money
---
tbf would be easy to make it so you can't trash/reproc it, as well as trade, contract, or otherwise remove it from your inventory. 
---
Set a password-protected 1-month timer &amp; go on vacation without worrying about your stuff!
---
Various problems, such as:
---
* Chats not working at all, or chat roster not updating 
---
* Chats working where they should not (local in w-space for example)
---
* Random switches to jita local (personally encountered - i was in abyss, and suddenly my local switched to jita, complete with 20 sec of fps drop - not pleasant)
---
* Massive performance problems
---
Some of those were adressed in those 10 months, some persist still
---
Space potato best potato
---
It did always bother me a bit that asteroids went directly from huge and intact to just blinking out of existence, but doubt I'll get to enjoy the visuals with all settings turned down to minimum for multiboxing.
---
Yeah, you said that already. Repeating it doesn't make it sound any less ridiculous.
---
Personally I hope they fix the issue instead of going back to the old system.  Thinking of the possibilities this system can have with modern technology is exciting 
---
Same as me I have 1 character with most of my money in the market buys and sells. Then when I run low I send my  money over
---
Honestly, just requiring the password to be entered before making any changes to the secure container would be a great solution.
---
look a dev blog giving exactly what people asked for, met with yet more shit posting. Cant make people happy for trying. 
---
They are not able to accquire any of the neccesary skills for invention, so that would be a no. 
---
/u/deltaxi this sounds vaugley familiar? :thinking:
---
Well my plan was that i would be able to keep up with a web and mwd active and be able to use the blasters. I was just afraid of the incoming damage potential so i wanted a cap stable tank instead. If i were to do it again i would drop some cap for drone tracking and a 2nd web.
---
I wanna try out abyssal PVP but I'm assuming all the rubes have probably stopped, thus making it pretty difficult to achieve a victory? 
---
if you can't be a friend to yourself how can you truly be friends with other people? Atleast that's what Bob Dave Harry John Mark and Franky tell myself
---
/u/deltaxi65 sounds familiar.... :thinking:
---
If any of the listed above are added to your contact list they only show up as that standing to you. As mentioned before, there is an option to notify another person on the add, though that is not required. 
---
Shhh don't say anything leave it for spais anyway :D
---
So what, people should let citadels you don't care about live? Or they should form kitchen sink fleets to go kill them? I'm not sure what the point of these threads is other than to try to give /u/NazAlGhul some competition for most insane circle jerk.
---
Doesn't it? 
---
Still plenty of baddies, but only in the 8-hr slot in EUTZ when it is open
---
And it only took a year!
---
&gt;this took far too long to be addressed
---
I saw someone in another thread suggest that they got a 1 year contract on the servers they used for the new chat system.  With this announcement I'm pretty sure they were correct and CCP resolved to attempt to fix the new system during that 1 year contract and if they couldn't they would revert to the old system.
---
lmao
---
Where comes the part where you sell skins for 15 euro? 
---
Brilliant question. The local pilot list is the only aspect of chat that needs to be rock-solid.
---
&gt; I think it's hosted on AWS, even? Don't remember for sure. There's probably some sort of issue communicating between the Eve monolith and the chat service
---
Yeah that's a real bad sign for their plans on offshoring the monolith into separate modular pieces.
---
If Monoclegate should have taught you anything then that CCP wants to maximise revenue from whales because they are the most likely to dump money for accessories.
---
excellent now do citadels
---
- Overheat those damm mining lasers!
---
- Sir , i am taking damage , request to turn off overheat. This is insane!
---
- No, soldier...THIS IS MINING!!!
---
https://youtu.be/S5z7Hb8kEfU
---
I'm guessing they are talking about the tackle rorq changes based on the context and the overused meme target.
---
what's wrong with it?
---
So if you hack an account. You just have to extract first. Then reset the password?
---
Omg I was so glad to read that second paragraph... I was so ready to launch into a tirade about the perpetually offended and the imaginary issues with taking issue with an imaginary race practicing imaginary slavery and imaginary religion... Imagine that...
---
Sadly I'm reading between the lines here that there is no plan to change the way intel gathering works.
---
Chat should be for chatting, not for one of the most crucial mechanics in warfare.
---
I mean, I moved my shit to Jita when TEST moved in. Rather pay NPC brokers than fund the operations of notorious Fleet Commander Taylor Crockett
---
CCP has been working on breaking the giant code-base known as the monolith into more manageable parts.  The benefit of this is they can put those on separate servers from the "node" servers which manage the solar systems in eve.  It is definitely something that should be done but obviously doing this can cause some unintended consequences so it's a delicate procedure.
---
In space you do not own, anchor times are not under your control. For everything else, there's mastercard. 
---
or maybe he's talking about rolling back the three separate nerfs to the rorqual's mining amount since they were released :V
---
Bummer, I'm US TZ. 
---
I don't usually get on until midnight eve time. 
---
Nice killmail mate. Good to see you still around! Keep doing the work!  :)
---
RemindMe! 3 Days
---
Great AAR. Awesome fight as well. I was triple boxing dreads and you guy killed two of mine. 
---
The active dread thing was a concept kinda of started with IED back a year ago. Quix and Cala have taken it to the next level like being able to tank t2 forts and 200 man ferox gangs. It is expensive and challenging to fly well, but can be super rewarding. I didn't do that well while triple boxing. And one of my dreads only had like 20 3200s cause I'm and idiot. 10/10 would fight again though.

If you can afford a Titan, you can afford 2 bil isk for a skin. That's the philosophy. Most skin prices are way cheaper than that and they're running sales all the time. You can find plenty of 50-150 plex skins in the store. 
---
Hey, those of us who can cross our eyes can do both.
---
Whoa, whoa! Careful there dude, you're sounding worryingly close to reasonable, which surely goes against the Eve subreddit's spirit.
---
The true deffinition of progress. 
---
I have all of those. Doesn't mean your account wont get hacked though ;)
---
I've heard lots of theories but I wouldn't believe everything I hear on reddit, especially when people get upset about something.
---
&gt; I'd probably pay ¬£2.50 and no more
---
so that's what, 150-200m for a permanent skin? There are skins around that pricepoint, and some that are much cheaper on market. which ones have you bought so far?
---
isn't the new chat system hosted on AWS? I don't think you can even have a 1 year lease on AWS VM's.
---
So what was 1 project team just got ballooned into possibly 3. That‚Äôs a strain on resources. Interesting. 
---
Don‚Äôt be ridiculous, google doc is fine. I‚Äôm so security conscious that I encrypted my password doc twice with ROT13, for double the security.
---
20196 plex for single capital ship is beyond retard. That's 19696 plex over month's subscription. You're paying month's subscription and changes for single ship on single character.
---
And that's when you realise how terrible CCP Product Development Team is... They cut off the extraction instead of selling the boosters that would allow you to do more than 3 extractions within 30 days, so lame...
---
...And I can feel my karma hurts...
---
"we don't know what's wrong"

Big balls. My kinda pilot.
---
^^^Rote ^^^is ^^^Recruiting)
---
500 plex is what 1.8 billion isk. So 695 is maybe 2.5 billion, for a hull that will cost you about 18 billion - 5000 plex that seems reasonable. If they were actually charging you 20 dollars for it I would agree it‚Äôs a joke, but since you can buy the plex with isk that you earn in game then technically it costs you nothing but time like every other mmo grind item.

KSO war with CF in one gif lol
---
Shield astero, best astero. Watch the enemy go "WTF"
---
It was speculation. 
---
Speculation that quite possibly could be accurate, but it's currently speculation. And until there's solid evidence to its veracity, it would be dumb as balls for the community to adopt the narrative as truth. 
---
Oh of course but this would actually make sense.  Like I actually don't think this took too long for this nuclear option.  CCP almost certainly had an internal deadline as a cutoff date for "if it's still bad by X date we have to revert."  Now 1 year could also be a coincidence but AWS does have 1 year contract option for servers which could also be a part of that decision.
---
They are called reserved instances and can come in 1 or 3 years. 
---
&gt;Finding a fast, effective and permanent resolution to these issues is now a top priority for the development team.
---
Now? We're just ignoring for the past 10 months? Lol
---
ya sue abbots is snowflake npsi fleets used to crap with him , always took us to ph space then , said just dock ships in the station and ill sell them for you , looks like we cannot escape - then left , wtf snowflake , im flying out.
---
Came here looking for this. Was not disappointed.
---
A 600mil Gila can do T4 with ease, you get between 30 and 80mil per sites. The real risk is a disconnect which is almost a guarantee. You cannot get ganked unless some one bother to scan down your signature, and in your home system you can just know from intel if someone is in your system and receive help (or scout with an alt, you know).
---
Is it even safer to run T3 in Jita ? Yes. But unless you are a dirty highsecer, why would you not run T4 or T5 if you can buy the Gila ?
---
IMO it‚Äôs better to be skins than golden bullets. If you don‚Äôt like them, don‚Äôt buy them. 
---
10 months. For a statement. 10 months
---
I agree that citadel spam is a problem, but not that this is the solution. This would open up the opportunity for groups to alpha the structure without concern for whether there was a fleet was there to defend it or not. The intention of the damage cap is clear: it is meant for the group shooting the structure to need to take the grid, or at least significantly contest it, to succeed.
---
A more reasonable solution is creating a mechanic that prevents the structures from being dropped in the first place, like an anchorable structure that must be destroyed or offlined before any other structure can be anchored in the system. This way, we can replicate the mechanic we used to have, where groups could defend their space from having forward operating POS setup by occupying the moons themselves. Another group could come and win a spot for their POS, but the people moving in had to find an opening in the armor, or create one.
---
*You* didn't do anything, pencil pusher.
---
i read that as "touching" newbros and was super confused on the first read through
---
Honestly, most people I know who run abyssal sites either run t1‚Äôs in lik 10 mil frigs, or speed run fleet t1‚Äôs solo in 300 mil worms, there needs to be more reward for more risk
---
PA has nothing to do with skin prices, there were this way long before.
---
I'm okay with spending 20‚Ç¨ on a titan skin since you most likely will sit on this ship for ever. I would really love to get a few subcap skins but I don't fly any of them enough to get the cool looking skins. 
---
Every site has an objective. Once you achieve that objective, the site, including its rats, gates, and collidable objects; will be flagged to despawn. For example: mining sites after the last rock is mined, exploration sites after a hack has been attempted on each can, mission sites after the loot-bearing object or boss NPC is destroyed. However, the despawn won't actually happen until two minutes after the last player has exited the site. Also, wrecks and containers will be preserved.
---
So say you're running the Blood Raider's 10/10, have finished destroying the stronghold (the objective), and it has dropped its can, but there are still a ton of rats around. You can either stick around and kill more rats until you can reach the can, or you can drop an MTU and wait for the can to be tractored in, or you can simply bookmark the can, warp off, wait 2 minutes, warp back to an empty site and get the loot with less hassle.

Gallente shuttle is the best looking of all the shuttles just another reason why those Caldari need to secede back to the Federation!
---
I may be the unpopular opinion, but I hope CCP finds a way to make the updated chat system functional with limited issues. It's vital that we continue to develop this game and plan for the future rather than revert to keeping the outdated systems in place. Those types of decisions are what's going to age this game.
---
My concern is this, would they be able to successfully bring back the old chat.
---
Something something most players are ignorant about 2FA. I'm sure some even ignore it out of principle ("CCP invented another new useless feature? Use my phone?\I don't have phone! etc etc").  
---
2FA is not mandatory and CCP currently does nothing to promote it with stick or carrot (looking at SWTOR way as perfect example - you get free stuff monthly for enabled 2FA).
---
You're thinking about this from the perspective of a person who still has a leg to stand on. Yes, this does happen all the time. When you are freezing and starving to death, your future employability can take a back seat to just making it through the night. Not everyone is eligible for military service. I don't think, for instance, that the army is champing at the bit to take a 48 year old man with a criminal record, drinking problem, and history of mental illness. You also don't walk into a recruiter's office and out immediately onto a bus off to basic. These people are in desperate need of something now, not in 6-12 weeks.
---
no counterplay, wut

No! And we ll be leaving 10 units in each rock :|

No, the saddest part is that you can say the exact same thing about TQ.

Yes, There are none on the market anywhere
---
Not really because if anybody finds out your doing it the roll the static in your face, and then do w/e they need to truth the new static and all you have is footage of your static being rolled from the outside. 
---
Just having people active in the hole is a way better solution it means, in general, you catch probes, and other then that accepting the reality that if some groups show up your logging everything and well waiting a couple of months.

Where is any evidence at all these people are choosing to go to prison?

Give us scaling of roids too? So they scale to the amount of ore left? Like 100.000 m3 roid is 100.000 is size. Eg 50*50*50 meters. And not as it is now where roids are massively bigger than their m3.

---
As someone who thinks he does a pretty good job generally, there are moments where he derails the discussion where I would prefer he let it play out a bit longer, then go for follow on explanations for the new players and shit.
---
Also it would be pretty neat to do a couple new player centric episodes, having dudes from the newbie groups come on and discuss a variety of topics focused towards things like why joining a player run group as opposed to npc is beneficial, resources used by the community, etc. Call it the newbie special or some shit.
---
i'm also pretty sure you can also extract the extra skills you trained while alpha to get to 5.5m and once omega just reinject them into omega only skills, that way you can have 5,5m skills points in just omega skills and their prerequisites and still run it as a skill farm
---
Jesus I didn‚Äôt realise they‚Äôd dropped that much. I must try and log in more than once every 3 years :)

There are empires STARBASE CHARTERS which have no use. let them use for structure timer.   
---
* normal mode - no change  
---
* low power structure - no active module, but needs starbase charters  
---
* critical power structure - no active module, no starbase charters, can be shoot down without reinforce mode
---
I know, I would be prefect!
---
TIL
---
still I can't imagine the infra footprint on AWS is terribly expensive for them
---
A toll? I wouldn't say that. If ya'll want to toss free killmails our way have at it.

Good bot

I mean that's just how the game is, if you want to be a corp CEO those things become quite important, at least if you're in null.

So...

They're going to break the old chat system too?
---
Based off this timeline, maybe in about a year we can get a statement from /u/CCP_Falcon on the fact that warp-ins don't show (ships just appear on grid), the fact that dscan is horribly broken, Jita  market going down daily, the fact that the client black screens for 30+ seconds when you login, and any of the other fun issues we've been dealign with for months.
---
just bot the t1/t2 abyssal sites like everyone else
---
Well yeah but as I said, that's one more big step preventing to easily get into it.
---
maybe all abyssals should have suspect... 
---
alright point taken wont help people.
---
I wouldn't either as long as it brings back Sir Molle and his antics. I was a goonfleet goon and still miss that guy. As much as we hated him he sure gave us entertainment and content. There is nobody like that in EVE anymore. Everyone now is just watered down versions of the goons of old with chat spamming, shit memes and joke names. 
---
hacker presses the unlock button, deletes the confirmation before you see it because they've already compromised your email, and waits 7 days
---
unless you're checking the status of your account obsessively this is not great protection compared to the very simple methods of prevention (strong password, no password reuse, 2fa). and it could easily give a false sense of security to people using it.
---
free sp? 
---
if you are reusing passwords then you are shooting yourself in the head and there's nothing that CCP can do to save you from yourself
---
I agree two of my accounts I will NEVER extract from and I would love the option to disable it.
---
I really don‚Äôt know how they can fuck up XMPP so badly.
---
i wanted this for YEARS as asteroids just *poof* when they are depleted, kinda would love it to shrink over time too (to show depletion over time) 
---
Good on CCP being open to the possibility. So often, companies double down and try to force the new, even when people prefer the old.
---
Welcome to Simple Farmers 2.0. Enjoy your stay! It's only just beginning. You, too, will feel the pain of repeated uncontested structure grinds made possible by CCP, which has been repeatedly told citadel mechanics are fucked, yet does nothing. Legacy just finished destroying 300+ in the HED-GP constellation and 75+ just got dropped in SV5 and F9E - all timezone tanked to AUTZ. The solutions are many and simple, but this citadel spam cancer is 'imaginative and dynamic' game play. Have a blast bois. Buy the bash ammo now, you're gonna need it. (I find it also hilarious that you cry about this mechanic ONLY when it affects you, yet everyone has been living with it since citadel inception) /u/LumpymayoBNI come have a laugh as the kids cry &lt;3
---
Smartbombs, what's that all about...
---
So, while taking a little jaunt through Cancer (Rancer) on my way to Jita.  I encountered a Smartbomb....I think.   Large area of effect visual and suddenly I am at 50% Structure.  Luckily, my Probe was set up for scouting instead of Explo and had a little bit of tank in the mids and lows, or this would have ended very badly.
---
Is there a counter to these things?   I guess, ideally, I could have a bookmark on the far side of that gate to jump to, but how would I ever establish such a thing (they seem so unfriendly there)?  Is there a maximum damage I could expect? 
---
I suppose the worst case scenario would be coordinated Smartbomber's, one after the next.  Is there a counter to this?  Trying to dock up in such a system for repairs seems unlikely to succeed.
---
Now, ya'll excuse me, I gotta go clean my shorts.
---
Well yeah. That's how e-mail inboxes get popped as described by /u/plynceress above so it's quite common. Non-technical people do that all the time.
---
While true for the largest bot farms this is viable to the many individuals who bot on only a few accounts.
---
Dude to choices in my 20s I am in IT instead of aerospace... I think its cool they are experimenting more with airfoil chapes lately. 
---
No you took it the wrong way D: you dun did gud &lt;3
---
Then dont complain about the mechanic if you want to kill them
---
We've put up with it for over a year, from several groups, yet the north starts crying after what..  3 days?
---
CO2 flair posting about PvE in hisec :thinking:
---
If somebody managed to reset your password you already fucked up. There is simply no way your account gets "hacked" without a major fuck-up on your part one way or another.
---
Yes, yes it does.
---
i saw someone asking a question, i like helping people and knew the answer so i posted it and got insulted for my efforts.
---
I enjoy abyssal sites but I would really like if they offered more danger in pvp aspects to the player. Make it glow like a cyno, one of the few exciting things for me is that although I have a peaceful time mining and ratting,  I always have to keep an eye on Intel to not lose my ship.
---
Better then nothing combined with 2FA and good passwords this gives your capsuleer safetu
---
Structures are like the only thing to fight over, so maybe, just maybe, it should be easier to kill them before they become a fucking catastrophe to grind over 1 week.
---
calm down mikal
---
I feel like CCP have known about it the entire time, but have been trying to fix it. Shall see though. 
---
Right? Not having a wallet account is asking for a fat finger disaster.
---
Came here to say this. 2FA at the start would have been a great idea, but better late than never. 
---
747 cruises at 0.85
---
Yeah but the 1 year contract would provide a natural deadline to evaluate AWS' feasibility and then roll back if its not doing the job. Since there's no way to simulate real scale, they just have to do their testing on prod.

---
Doesn't 2FA just go to your email anyway though?
---
wow, a game company in fact considers reverting something back to its old state.
---
IMO, if you can't make it work even 10 months later, scrap it.
---
Good fight dude! 
---
... are you high?
---
More like I spanked Sue's Vigilant on the 4-4 undock and then got harassed by him afterwards. 
---
Aka: Just stop roaming
---
You do realize every location has capitals and cynos now right? Saying to roam somewhere is a bit short sighted, when its the same no matter where you go.
---
"Stop trying to pvp in a pvp game, we just want to mine and RMT- I mean BOT-.. i mean make legitimate isk to save up for my 5th rorq alt".
---
It's sending strings between clients, not exactly rocket science.
---
OK, defend against a 50 man dreadbomb without having the astrahus which is in hull die. Oh, what's that? It died before you could even cyno in your titans? Awww, that's too bad.
---
Should have stuck to structure bashing like us... 
---
The ones that are 55 plex are shit, that's why they're 55 plex. I also wouldn't pay 2.50 for those.
---
I think that's fine, hooking it up with their monstrous Python shit is what's difficult.
---
that seems like a terrible capacity planning though, they could easily do a 1 month non-reserved instance to estimate scale and see issues then convert over to a leased model though when they better understand capacity.
---
it's not like they're going to use up 10k vm's on aws
---
There is a pvp aspect to it. Abyssal holes are scannable with i believe combat scanners, possibly also probe scanners (someone fact check me). So basically, if u wanted to, u could hop in a system, scan it down, warp and wait for whoever to pop out, with a cargo bay full of loot and i believe they r set as suspect so u an even welp them in high sec (again fact check me). Only issue, is nobody bothers scanning them down, and besides jita, its hard to find systems where people r actually doing sites.
---
Shit i might start farming abyssal people in jita myself now that i think about it
---
I figure it cost me about $40 in Netflix fees....
---
The sad part is that, if you knew me and my luck, you would know I'll probably lose it on day 1.  It'll be shit fit, half my net worth but it's MINE!
---
Are they charging skeleton prices for the subscription? _Then_ they get some slack.
---
he'll tell you to HTFU. But when anyone mentions cyno nerfs/cap application nerfs, he will be the first to cry and sperg out that his toys are getting nerfed.
---
The day CCP rebalances caps is going to be a great day for tear harvesting.
---
That one is not CCP's fault, the game requires an internet connection and you couldn't get one of those from Russia.
---
2016 toon btw
---
Something something POS code
---
When you anticipate that a smartbomb gank is waiting for you, you typically have a ping bookmark that‚Äôs not in a direct warp line between gates. Warp to that bookmark first, see if there are any suspicious ships that look like smartbombers, and then warp directly on top of the gate. 
---
I'm not surprised you're claiming people bot them.
---
In a gila T1s and t2s are as afkable as a vni in null. The only real input you need is picking up your loot and moving to the next room. So, about 4 or 5 clicks every 5 mins. 
---
Hell I may come back they fix the chat. It really was a deal breaker for me =\
---
have you submitted a bug report about it? 
---
You are describing the exact same thing but with more words.
---
Just because you can afford something, doesn't mean it's worth the price.
---
What if I can only afford a revelation? Can I still afford 2 bil isk for a skin?
---
Hey man did you ever catch up with brisc? Heard he was looking for you.
---
How much isk would that make hourly, I only make around 400mil per hour mining with a porp + 3 barge alts.
---
it adds about $5/mo to the cost, you are overestimating how much work this is.
---
how to you "report as botter". When I right click the names all I see is "report for ISK selling" or something like that.
---
I‚Äôm still training for my large porpoise with mega mining drones, tell me how it goes!
---
For what? Even more broken mining?
---
What fitting are you using for a T4 Gila? And what types of sites are running for that to work safely?
---
Can run havens in cheap ship way less risk and effort.
---
They could start selling P2W stuff or loot boxes, those are untapped revenue sources
---
Aww someone is salty about all the citadels going down in Oijanen. Show me on the bear where Sue hurt you!
---
Revert those things to previous versions?
---
This is an interesting update. Rorquals mine faster on smaller radius rocks, so if the rocks reduce in radius as the rorqual mines them, then they will have a slight increase in income over the life of the rock.
---
it really is though who uses local ffs?
---
Awwww, let me know when your alliance is actually able to kill one. Only took you two months to get one into hull!
---
How does that fit not die to a passive gila? you have a weak sauce tank versus damage that isn't kin/exp
---
You must be confusing me with another dead alliance that dropped 50 titans and couldn‚Äôt kill a fortizar in range of every one of their enemies stagings! Also look at the HED-GP constellation, we can kill plenty in no time.
---
While editing it keep messing me up too. Sorry!
---
i love it
---
Are they making those, or licencing those? If the second, they're not paying for it.
---
Alternately, he just skilled into it the good old fashioned way and used an Ishtar until he could afford to buy one.
---
Can make it an ice miner, isotopes prices are way higher than they where back in 2010 these days 
---
I watch gold rush
---
&gt; implying simple farmers isn't just panfam alts anyway
---
Sure - just insurance fraud it. 
---
It's worth what folks will pay for it, and given how many lava skins I saw on Titans in our staging yesterday, I'd say it's priced properly. 
---
*F1 pusher.
---
A step in the right direction for sure, CCP heard our outcry among the REEEing and have made a change to take the edge off.
---
However, i remember far better solutions to solving extraction protection in the last big thread on this issue, and some are already being posted in this thread again.. this seems like a bandaid, instead of actual effort.
---
If someone is able to 'hack' the current password of the account, they simply log in and extract anyway, no limits, unless the account owner is constantly changing their password to reset the timer.
---
Or players who have taken a break from eve, or otherwise cant return to eve for a time, get their account hacked and their skills extracted before they return.
---
CCPls, you can do better than this.
---
The reason there is not a massive proliferation of bots in WH space is that there is far less money on a sustainable 23/7 basis than there is in sov null with infinite respawn isk faucet combat anoms.
---
It doesn't matter if you pad your killboard with botters, the botter doesn't care that they get ganked, they step into the next ship effortlessly.  Active players who make their money from PvE generally do care, they get a lot less ISK/day than the botters, and removing local hurts them more than the botters.  Making it a fucking retarded idea.  If you want to get away from local, go live in wormholes.
---
Ok, that all makes sense, so there are a few options to really catch someone. Looks like I haven't encountered someone with that type of setup luckily.
---
I might aim for this type of setup in the future though, sounds like fun! 
---
Rofl. NCPL literally did this to us for a year.
---
Hello sir do you have a moment to hear about our Lord and Savior autoscaling infrastructure?
---
It's a Scorditan!
---
Which utterly misses the point, which is that with local removed the bot becomes *more able than active players* to deal with the changed environment.  At the same time, the botter suffers far less from losses to ganks because they get a whole lot more ISK/day than active players who do things like eat, work, and sleep.
---
Fweddit is over in Villasen. I hope we get in on this action soon!
---
Add a captcha to the game every 30 minutes. 
---
Shit idea? Blame the people who made it necessary. 
---
Awesome! Looking forward to seeing the streams. 
---
I‚Äôm not involved in bashing the citadels. I would‚Äôve posted the same thing had I seen the test post on the same subject. My point remains the same. I don‚Äôt think a damage cap should exist at all if we are being honest.
---
When I was in PH I thought a porpoise was one of the higher tiers of mining, but literally it‚Äôs still one of the lowest rungs in the mining ladder. Aspire for the rorqual dude! Orca is good too but aspire for that rorq!
---
Honestly despite its problems I wouldn‚Äôt want the old system to come back for the sake of reliability and, better to face the future and its current problems in the interest of EvE‚Äôs future than move backwards.
---
Bring Chessur Plox
---
Yep. I mean, maybe this new wing concept has some advantages in drag reduction, but trying to frame it purely as "high speed" when it's still slower than some of the oldest designs in service... 
---
*chuckles*
---
Okay so I spend 365mil to insure it, I blow it up and get 1.2 billion. So now i've made ~850million minus any mods or rigs on the ship. Now I still don't have enough for a skin or a revelation to put it on. GJ coach.
---
I think if the revelation skins are going to be more than the revelation, then the avatar skins should cost more than the avatar. Or we could do it the other way and make them a small percentage of the hull cost like the avatar skin is.
---
"I'll buy something nice at a borderline insultingly low price point"
---
interesting that CCP does not feel this is a market worth exploring... more work for less money, how could they lose?
---
Idgaf about skins and their prices but this post was an entertaining read.
---
This is still something people have been groaning about since like 2010, the rocks just poofing from existence was dumb, I‚Äôm sure they are working out what to do about local and the warp bug. Honestly CCP probably plans updates months in advance so this asteroid thing could‚Äôve been something they began in like 2017.
---
But that‚Äôs fine, because of how the market works a bunch of people are gonna jump on ice mining and the prices will crash for the next two years
---
Insultingly low?
---
Mate, pull the other one. Cosmetics in other games are significantly cheaper than ccp are selling them for and habe significantly fewer restrictions.
---
Yeah it has caused lag spikes when randomly connecting to jita, almost died to a gate camp because of it
---
  I don't extract SP at all but have some nicely high sp mains give us an option to lock extraction permanently 
---
No need for any bookmarks. If you suspect a smartbomb camp (they are very common in lowsec), you just have to avoid warping directly to the out gate. 
---
SB camps are positioned in such a way that they can only kill ships warping in from a certain direction - generally from the busiest other gate in the system. So you need a way to warp to the gate, but not from that direction. If the gate is near a planet, look for asteroid belts or moons around it, and just warp to one of those first. They will rarely if ever be in line with your initial in-gate. 
---
Sometimes, the gates are sitting on their own. You can look at your system map, and figure out a different planet to warp to first to alter your route. Failing everything else, you can simply warp to the gate at 100km to check it out - if you see smartbombers, just burn around them etc. etc. 
---
You can anticipate a SB camp in a few ways. You can check your route in [Gate Checker](http://eve-gatecheck.space/eve/). You can look for players with suspect timers in local. If the gate is close-by, you can look for battleships on d-scan (smartbombers are almost exclusively battleships). And if you're carrying something very valuable to you, simply never ever warp directly from gate to gate if you see anybody in local at all. 
---
Given how many people I see in fleets that never use a skin, there's a lot of potential sales ccp aren't getting.
---
I'd gladly sit and argue that when it comes to price elasticity of demand, ccp are missing out on a lot of potential sales.
---
I know that I'd spend more than the current bugger all I'm spending right now if the prices were less offensive, as would some one else that replied to one of my other comments earlier today. I doubt we're not alone in this.
---
I've said it before and I'll say it again
---
*I care less about the content of CCP's statements, just that there are statements at all*. Any communication is better then no communication. 
---
Why though? If someone is so dedicated to hack an account surely they'll wait the wait and still extract...
---
So it's pretty crap that they're in this position but fair play for finally communicating about it, and also for considering they might have to roll back.
---
I would sooner fuck a porcupine every half hour than play click the bicycle.  Unlike me, bots handle asinine image recognition minibames without annoyance; captcha doesn't stop anyone who's trying.
---
IRL happed. I will be back.
---
Can you and Felix stop shitting up my corp killboard tia
---
I'm not sure a month would be enough to be a good test though. Say it works fine after a month and do a 3 year contract and then the problems only crop up after 6 months for some reason like maybe summer traffic increases, then you're shit outta luck. A full year trial accounts for seasonal differences and gives them a chance to truly evaluate it in real world circumstances. They probably did as much testing as possible before moving the whole server over, but in the end there's no real way to simulate thousands of concurrent users. 
---

Somewhat relevant

So I keep hearing this, but what exactly does this mean? It was my understanding that ships always just appeared on grid.
---
These two systems are not mutually exclusive
---
I am puzzled on how you roll a static "from the outside"?
---
If I leave security cam on the wh at least I have footage of who is rolling my holes.
---
That's bait m8.
---
Usually you see the ship warp in (and decelerate), not appear at its final position on grid.
---
Currently, about 30% of the time, overview doesn't change until ship is already out of warp.
---
They already scared away all the players who would have rioted if that happened. At this point it's a matter of when, not if they will.
---
Damn, literally fragged by the bank.... :)
---
who the heck care about ship skin?in battle no1 look to your ship skin
---
It is common to have multiple characters in Eve to compensate "skill holes" for your activities. I, for example, have have an alt/twink having most skills in industry and mining, with some skills in Covops and Cyno to use him as a forward scout/cyno if needed.
---
Having more than one account gives you more freedom in any direction quicker than having just one account does.
---
This + scan res for bs would be plenty of reimburshment for the chat system mess :D

even if they are making them PA is likley going to fund most of it. One of the reasons for PA to buy CCP was so that they can get a share of the Chineze mobile gaming market as Korean developpers are banned in China.

Hell yeah man, keep on keeping on, great streams dude
---
The way they phrased it makes it sound like the rocks becomes smaller while being mined.

Wouldn't that allow someone facing eviction in a wormhole to deny loot to the evicting party?
---
NSA should also lock carriers in place like siege modules
---
Maybe make it so unless you use 2FA with the account you can‚Äôt extract? That may also fix ghost farms? Or curb it.
---
Ah. Yeah, that's no bueno. Thanks for the information.

Full circle! It was awesome to help make this happen, keep on gaming brother!
---
There are plenty of affordable skins on the market, as I've noted, and even more are for sale at affordable rates in the game. There are tons of skins that sell for less than 50 mil isk. 
---
You mean, CCP isn't purposely trying to get the playerbase used to no local, like w-space?
---
MIND. BLOWN.
---
My insurance fraud comment was a joke. 
---
I don't know what to tell you - if you can't afford it, you can't afford it. These are priced at a level where they'll sell but also at a level where they aren't going to be ubiquitous because people like having stuff that other folks don't. That's part of the desire in some of these skins. 
---
Revs aren't strategic assets like titans anymore, and the average player who has a Rev has more than one. I think the stuff is priced properly. 
---
I like skins and I collect them. But for the expensive ones (let's say more than 200plex) I just don't pay. I either gonna wait for a sale or never get it. It doesn't matter how I got the Plex
---
fc what is academia
---
Comment of the thread.
---
Unless you're Elon Musk, no investors are going to pool 50 mil together for your start up's 1st round of funding. The code monkeys don't go looking for the investors, the one whose dream their building does.
---
Pure onanism.
---
Yeah, thats not –°–°P's fault, but it's their problem, not mine. If they can to take my money for subscription(with Internet connection), i shoold be able to play this game, equel with others.
---
This is just situational and only for a few people, you can't use it if you are actively playing.
---
I propose another solution:
---
If a hacker logs in, it should not be able to touch or do anything.
---
Horde banned orcas aside from private ops, my porpoise + 3 barge combo is making a decent amount of isk and my rorq fitting is about 3 weeks away from being trained. Only thing left if for me to farm the ore for an indy to craft one for me or to buy one
---
Ah, the volume of leave/join traffic.  Thanks.
---
Do we have the feature that lets us see asteroids visibly deplete as we mine them, and if so, how can I make sure I haven't turned the graphics so low it doesn't render for me?
---
With no damage cap they just get blapped by a capital blob. That's pretty much uncounterable - one cloaky cyno ship, drop a dread bomb, the structure dies in one siege cycle. With enough capital spam you can volley it even.
---
A soft cap (diminishing returns for DPS) is a better suggestion in this area, I would say.
---
I bought 3 mil worth of T1 filaments and came out with almost 500 mil of stuff. Probably luck but it was easy as balls. 
---
We're not talking about exoplanet Hunter skins.
---
I still laugh hard from The Scanner and how proud he still is :D
---
Yeah a FLEX structure (though it shouldn't require sov) to forbid anchoring of anything else in system while it's online is a pretty good idea.
---
This is one of the moments where we look at what ~~our players~~ CCP developers do and less of what they say.
---
what is she doing? Boobs are down there
---
You can use it just don't forget the password. The only time you can't access the container with your assets in it would be if you can't provide your own password.
---
When I hear folks saying "I'd buy more skins if they were cheaper" I'm not going to assume they're only talking about the NE store skins. After all, skins are skins. You can get the same skins that are in the NE store on the market for isk, generally the same price in isk you'd pay in plex. Sometimes it's less. 
---
They're a cosmetic item, and given how much revenue they generate, I think it's unlikely you're going to see the prices drop anytime soon. People are buying them - at least, the folks who buy skins. Some folks don't bother and that's fine. 
---
I like broken chat just call it subspace interference or something, and let the bot culling commence!
---
The art team we need but don't deserve, spodbless them all. 
---
Yup lockdown vote then shareholders vote and the BPO will be lockdown and unmovable

This could be easily solved by making citadels break the containers when destroyed with no asset safety.

Talking in station is a podcast....

"This is one of the moments where we look at what ~~our players~~ CCP developers do and less of what they say."

nah Have some other random system's local pop up and scare the shit out of the natives. Local randomly freezes and you think it is safe when it is not. The tears would flow.
---
So what if they are? It's 800 mil, who cares.
---
Yes, and if I won't pay 250 plex for it, I ain't gonna pay 800m isk either.

The currency doesn't matter.

Why does everyone hate the new chat? Maybe I‚Äôm just too casual to notice but it seems to be alright. Can‚Äôt tell a difference to be honest
---
The year long contract they signed for the AWS is ending apparently.
---
nice dude
---
Instead of sp, how about a month of omega
---
Well, they spent an entire year trying to fix a core broken part of an MMO and its still as broken as ever, I think that's beyond doubling down.
---
Sold.
---
Oh gawd ... I just finished explaining container hell to someone trying to get two different versions of Python running on RHEL, and wondering why they had to "scl enable" a specific version.
---
You need to quit that alliance.
---
Auto targeting while useless when active (because you can literally turn auto target on in the esc menu) gives your ship additional max ships locked even when not active. I do believe that unlike the esc menu auto lock, that this module will detect passive locks and lock back back when you begin being locked rather than when you are already locked.
---
Pretty much this. CCP is a relatively small company, but they still have enough corporate and management structure that they can‚Äôt spin on a dime. Not exactly the first time a new CCP ‚Äòupgrade‚Äô has had teething problems either, see brain in a box for that.
---
4 faction LSE, faction 10MN,  one adaptative, T2 passive regen rigs, 3 DDAs.
---
I suddenly have visions of , "Update Finshed!", and logging into a retro version of the client.
---
&gt; Sure there are many groups providing a middle ground and aim to provide a variety of PvP to their members. If you stick around long enough you will surely have great fleet experiences. 
---
GSF is a good choice, there are SIGs for just about every conceivable activity.
---
&gt;Imo the issue are groups that do the opposite, demotivating their members, "don't undock, don't feed - they will come back looking for more targets"  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Those are the groups you should be running away from.
---
There are lots of laid back renter groups in the drone regions that make no corp level effort to do pvp and they do just fine.  Its the corps that try to do home defense that end up hemorrhaging members and disbanding. They rarely have decent FCs and the linemembers aren't interested in training the specialized ships that you need. Fleet formups take forever because you can't find anyone with links trained and the one guy with recon V has to be bribed to log in. Home defence fleets burn out FCs and 
---
Usually they just end up feeding and soon their space is cloaky camped and they can't do anything at all.  
---
 The proper way to deal with roaming gangs is to deny kills or just drop a shitload of caps on them, do this and they stop coming. Some renter groups even fine members who lose ships to roaming gangs.
---
Most of them are literally palette swaps that take 2 seconds of dev time, with a once-over to fix any issues that crop up, but a huge amount of them are plain palette swaps.  A previous bug that let you put any skin on any ship proved this to be true.
---
Woah, I've never seen this before. What an awesome device! How can I watch your stream?
---
Honestly, I like this idea, but I spent lots of time in a wormhole, so its nothing new to me.  Our nullsec denizens may take issue with it, and perhaps even find a legitimate concern.
---
Still, this sounds a lot more effective than removing local to address botting.
---
We get it. You're cheap or poor. That's fine. You're not the target audience then. Some people like the exclusivity of some skins, like me. 
---
That is definitely true, but in my time of being a grunt in a large corp I didn't make like any ISK, and that worthless virtual currency is my real motivator.
---
Good point!
---
savage
---
Ya, they are getting faster.
---
Have you considered swapping the windows around?
---
Not that I have any actual knowledge of how the old system works, but if it's anything like XMPP or IRC the two are essentially inseparable. 
---
The local capsuleer list is just a list of the people present in a chat channel, and there is one chat channel per system that the game automatically moves you to when you jump through a stargate.
---
Unless you're talking about running the two simultaneously, but at that point you might as well just switch back to the old system altogether.
---
I‚Äôve heard one rorq is usually about 100 mil an hour, so 40 would be 4 bil. However, I imagine you‚Äôd be at least slightly less efficient if you were trying to manage 40 ships at once 
---
The real problem?  On top of the normal issues, CCReee totally fucked the balance with frigate abyssmals.  They give 3x the loot, and yet can be run with WAY less risk than the cruiser ones.  As much as they try to say they're hard PVE, they're really not once you learn the basics.  You can easily triple box T3-4s in T2 fit assault frigates, totaling &lt;200m isk investment, and make 3x as much as running T4s in a 2B+ cruiser.  You can probably even do some T5s for way cheaper than T4, but I haven't really tested multiboxing those, and T4s are usually more sane risk VS reward anyway because the spawn difficulty scale is so unbalanced.

---
All this cause sue  is dropping citadels on your space lol 
---
Probably not, but they could have a sale on skins!
---
That would be just as good, right!
---
The POS code is more stable than the current chat code.
---
its a simple solution, make med structures cost 10 bil, large 50-100bil, xl a few tril.
---
Jove shuttle?
---
Have to have the meetings and fill-out the forms first.
---
Using only speculation and a fractionally related experience I can say that the mechanism of  a "Dynamic Load Balancing Auto Scaling Fault Tolerant" infrastructure is the root cause of problems similar to our beloved chat.
---
Still, having tons of pointless structure bash ops doesn‚Äôt benefit these people. It would help literally everyone if they did something to make citadel spamming less effective 
---
oh so this is what you tell yourself to endure tidi fest #34, got it, truly everyone needs a coping mechanism.
---
Got to start somewhere
---
What a childish reply lol
---
For sov null maybe the answer is that an anchoring structure starts onlining at least 23h after you anchor it AND at the time the sov is timed for.
---
Once online the vuln time you set when you launched it kicks in.
---
This comment deserves more appreciation. Like the art team.
---
A rorq is ~150M an hour = ~6B/H. But actually multiboxing 40 is a pain in the ass I imagine.
---
Fantastic community, fantastic people. Despite the chaos around the world, there is some beauty. Very happy for you friend, enjoy.
---
You don't *need* the skin do you so how are you "fucked"?  
---
But he never got the lossmail for the caracal interestingly enough 
---
Would do but there seems to be no gate from lowsec to Stain... 
---
No, you have to put in a code from the Google Authenticator app which is unique to each account and changes every few minutes. If you don't have the app that's linked to the account to get the codes you're SOL. 
---
&gt; 10 months is unacceptable.
---
Hence the old chat system is a Caesarian.
---
i'm sorry but if they have enough dreads to kill an astra fast enough that you can't cyno something in (which should take what? 3-5 seconds at most?) you ain't gonna defend it regardless of the grid.
---
I think CCP try to optimise the price of the skin against the expected demand.  There's a crossover point for the price isn't there.  Yes they'd sell more if they reduce the price, but they might not make more money doing that.
---
Go ask a local cop.  It usually jail not prison and the jails know whats up and will hold them for a couple days if the weather is bad.
---
With properly sorted overviews, you basically tab through windows rapidly and it scales pretty well from a technical perspective. Its complete aids from a gameplay perspective though.
---
&gt; wormholer btw

I don't know how this thing works, but I can't wait to watch you body some people online with it. Game on homie.
---
Yep, keep the password in hardcopy near your computer and it's pretty safe. Probably make it possible to ask a GM to un-protect stuff if you haven't recently changed your account PW/email. 
---
The main use would be for players going on vacation or indefinite hiatus from Eve. 
---
Not a lot of people have a lot of their networth in assets in 4-4, although for that crew, a change like this would let us sleep easier (knowing years of work accumulating isk/rares won't be wiped out in 3 minutes if someone gains access to your 4-4 alt). 
---
are you telling me we mustn't applaud the efforts to make it clear that indeed
---
keepstars die when they are killed?
---
Yeah, no being reasonable in here. Get out! 
---
I feel you man.
---
stop cofee-enema-shaming me
---
I am not sure how it works exactly but i think that is a normal/known thing, obvs the insurance confirmed it :D 
---
&gt; it took CCP ten freaking months to realise that the new chat backend was failing
---
That ticket just hit the top of the queue.
---
I mean, I'm not a bot, but I do that because I have no life.
---
he just wants to be able to use his own no counterplay weapons, titans.
---
Are you talking about EVE, or your email?
---
Teehee 
---
I'm not really so sure. If you have 30-50k clients, people are less than likely to send more than one chat message per second, but likely receive a ton of messages at the high-end (think jita local, 4k person fights where 1 message gets sent but received by a lot of people) - but it's still pretty tolerable. I've seen ejabberd handle really high throughput previously, so I'm honestly be shocked if it's more than just like 2-4 bigger-ish vm's in the background. EVE is frankly, not that big, nor does it require a ton of additional post-processing e.g. spam detection / advanced filtering.
---
We  take day 1 old rookies and get them into solo and small gang pvp in faction warfare space. We just set things up so they can  blow through 50 coercers to learn the ropes. 
---

---
And exactly why would rorquals need this buff to isk and safety? 
---
We don't it's just coming in one of the next few patches.
---
&gt; shit is tasty because we've been eating it for the last year
---
I mean if your pilots didn't complain about it that's just them being retarded tbh
---
Cool thanks for the quick answer.
---
That's your decision. The currency matters to those who don't want to spend RL currency on skins. If you don't think the price is worth it, then it's not worth it. 
---
If it's not worth it to everybody and nobody buys the skins, then I would expect to see them lower the cost. But that doesn't appear to be happening. 
---
&gt; CCP why should I run higher tier abyssal sites?
---
What's an abyssal site?  [rhetorical]
---
I never knew this existed until now, would love to watch your stream if you could share a link. 
---
How does eve compare to other games when it comes to using this controller? 
---
Really had my eyes opened to the possibilities of who is behind the mic and how incredible it is that games like eve are able to bring us together. 
---
Oh, there's plenty of solutions and we've all talked about them here ad infinitum. Sitting here complaining about this obviously glaring issue is tantamount to spitting in the wind. Until CCP listens to the player base (which they seem to have repeated issues doing), live with it or PM a CSM rep.
---
Because you can't do basic math it seems. 9mil hp is practically nothing at fleet level and the cap makes the fight last longer than a minute. 
---
Yeah, however raitarus are spammy because they are so cheap. Perhaps raising the cap for them would be an option. Because instead on one super, you could place 100 raitarus...
---
And lets be honest, nobody wants to grind a 100 fkn raitarus
---
What about Ice ice baby?
---
make portrait as close as posible and use a synonim for the name 
---
Tiericide is finished
---
It is waiting for you behind the door in your captain‚Äôs quarters. 
---
at least they're following the steps of the game they're developing
---
also if you are in FW and the other ship is in opposing FW you can freely attack )
---
You missed number 487 ...
---
j/k!  It is amazing!  wow!
