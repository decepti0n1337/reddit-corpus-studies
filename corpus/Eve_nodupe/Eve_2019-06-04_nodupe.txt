You do you boo. I like it too.
---
Make it fun.
---
Raw goo and salvage, the two primary region specific resources, are so low in volume that they are all handled by jump freighters.
---
I made one for Talismans (which are ridiculously cheap btw) a few months ago, I can clean it up and post it if there's interest. Mine does include every combination of a full set.
---
Well, what do you want to do with it? PvE or PvP?
---
In case of PvE you usually fit for whatever you need to tank and then add at least 2 Drone Damage Amplifiers. Highslots are optional, most people use Rapid Lights in it to get rid of npc-frigates while the drones work on the bigger targets. With medium drones tracking is rarely an issue as well. So it's mostly just tank and raw dps plus prop-mod you go for.
---
The stats of that guy https://zkillboard.com/character/90708852/stats/
---

---
Citadels + Towers = &gt; 250
---
He is UTTERLY lifeless, for gods sake, someoen help him
---
I would use it for pvp. I’m currently at about 500 dps but I have no idea how good that is on dps
---
I love atrons. I usually fly a falloff atron. 
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/77056593/
---
That catalyst pilot was bad though. He only had antimatter in his cargo. If he had T2 guns with null or even just his meta guns with a ranged ammo, he could've blapped you really quickly.
---
Remove at least one timer on structures.
---
Assets Safety only triggers after being offline for a month.
---
Region locked resources.
---
Rorqs are the best possible link ships for mining, with special aoe weird effects that boost defensive capabilities and all the jazz (but nerfing PANIC a little). They can't mine for shit.
---
Rework FW in LS to make it a cradle of subcap content (this is a really long topic), a place where HS and NS players are drawn to at least daytrip for the rewards.
---
Remove insurance.
---
Fuck farms and fields.
---
In about 3-6 months (as omega) you can fly all T1 ships from frigate to battleship, with all weapon systems, and all support skills to level 4.
---
You can get into interceptors, stealth bombers, an interdictor and a T3C afterwards  in 2-3 months.
---
A carrier in 3 months after that.
---
That's only 1 year.
---
Thanks for the info.
---
Mittens specifically talked about you during the fireside and then twice during the meta show he brought your name up.     
---
Are you worried about your reputation with Mittens, Boat and that other turbo nerd Aryth shit talking about you to the goon Kool aid drinkers?
---
Lol most people don’t ply a game for a year just answering the question
---
Ahhh red.. You really have no idea do you? The stuff that goes on behind the scenes to make what we do possible is by a large part stuff that you have no idea even goes on.
---
You don't have to be in fleets to help win a fight. Just like the rest of eve goons are a sandbox and there's various ways you can help the alliance, FCing and F1 monkeys aren't the only ones putting in work.
---
I used to think it was bots making the price 9999.99, but then I discovered the scroll wheel does that.
---
They don't panic each other.
---
Thanks Jin! Keep the videos coming buddy!
---
I believe user story / persona have been part of interactive entertainment before agile framework as they have existed as a writing tool for creating fiction for a long time. I believe even NES Mario has fundamentals of personas in terms of how they created level 1-1. Anyway, I just can't imagine developing a game and NOT thinking of the persona of the person playing the game.
---
This can happen when you select Charisma and Intelligence as dump stats.
---
Delayed local for everyone until gate cloak expires.
---
Speaking out of my ass here:
---
Move the HQ from Iceland to either EU or USA, in order to make it more attractive for potential employees.
---
Employees are required to play Eve for at least 6 hours/week. Can select between CCP wormhole, null or low sec corp. Corps are by default wardecced by every corp in Eve.
---
Expand marketing team and rehire community management.
---
Severely limit citadels in FW regions.
---
Region specific resources and depleting resources, in order to incentivize mobility.
---
PI factories can be attacked, on reinforcement timer.
---
Sell uniform skins with corp/alliance logo.
---
Offer monthly alliance prizes for certain PVP milestones: 500 man capital battle with at least x bil Isk lost? Get to name a system for a year.
---
I've played on and off since 09. If anything I want to be able to manipulate my windows and market data more. 
---
Let me move NeoCom to the bottom.
---
Allow customization of target lock icons. I want vertical shield/armor/hull while able to see things like velocity and target of target. 
---
I feel like the market screen hasn't changed at all and maybe if they adopted a more ElvUI mod like for WoW the customization of your "HUD" could provide a more interactive experience.
---
No, just to your Corax.
---
I am not. Remarkably, one of my biggest goals while I was in Goonswarm was to have the Mittani (pbuh) bring up my name on the Fireside or the Meta Show because that meant I was doing something that my leader noticed and was proud of.
---
Funny how it worked out that I got mentioned on both in the same way for something completely opposite.
---
Step 13
---
I really like this idea!
---
Marketing. Honestly I'm not even sure if they currently advertise this game...
---
You could keep the time training aspect but include a bonus per usage when using that item.
---
It’s fine, you should like it, it’s yours.
---
Apparently not.
---
I know nothing about the Black Hand or any of the recon that happens behind the scenes. I certainly don't know about tactically blueballing your enemy and psychological warfare or what burning a region does to a group's morale.
---
I know nothing, Elkin Snow. :)
---
I actually really like that I do think that is one thing that keep people away it just feel like a time locked cell phone game
---
Also try to replicate in fortnight and world of tanks
---
Why would CCP want to decrease the amount of accounts subscribing? Honest question....
---
&gt;* remove null sec chat
---
Like a "Hail" function. You have to be able to scan/probe them down and the HAIL a request.
---
Type in local or Jita "Help I'm a noob and I ran out of Isk" Someone will help you out. Remember to do the same for another noob when you are rich and powerful.
---
Last I checked, when you do all the math and adjust for month to month inflation of PLEX, an account with 3 sp farming characters (and nothing else) will lose about 400m or so a month at Jita. Perimeter loses even more.
---
And yet, look at how ccp balance this game ;)
---
I'm fucking tearing up right now with this beautiful magical post.
---
If you xfer your keepstar it's because you know you're playing a n+1 game and you know you aren't on the +1 side of it.
---
My question is essentially: What drones should I use for what I'm fighting? Here's my guess, I want to verify if it's correct: 
---
If my enemy is fitted for Kiting, I should match the size of my target. Light drones for frigs, medium for cruisers and heavies for battleships. Otherwise, they might be able to kite my drones.
---
If my enemy is fitted for brawling/scram kitting, do I just use the heavies? Or should I go for 1 class above my target (medium for frigs, heavy for cruisers)?
---
Or does it not matter and I should always use 1 size bigger than my target (medium for frigs, heavy for cruisers)?
---
Took a bit of a break to sort out IRL stuff that's it.
---
Yes this would have to come with structure changes.
---
Rip your wallets balance
---
Made a long video about this a while ago
---
https://www.google.com/url?q=https://m.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D0S8Tg5q1yok&amp;sa=U&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjSk7ztyM7iAhVqhOAKHYR0AXAQtwIwAHoECAoQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw3B-6hFtMhxW4ZjsnJLljeg
---
what are you trying to say
---
In market but i think its like the guardian-Vexor the ones that have it not gonna sell it.
---
To attack an income stream. Doing it for the botting money would be super dumb if we dont collect taxes from them.
---
Removing infinite anoms would have the most profound effect.  By far.
---
Punishing the ganker post gank does not improve the experience of the new player who got ganked
---
Beta clone 
---
- very low cost (100 PLEX a month?)  
---
- same 20.5m skills as Alpha  
---
- 10m training cap (double Alpha)  
---
- Dual boxing allowed (2 only. Omega + Beta or Beta + Beta)
---
Huh didnt relize this was a troll, go fuck yourself ?
---
I'm curious about your reason for bots.
---
What if you could run "bots" ingame through a character. Say training a skill to allow you to fly multiple clones?
---
Could even be a skill called:
---
 Multi Interface Linear Functioning 
---
Or something like that.
---
you forgot the ww2 analogies
---
Loki.
---
 \- basically 90% of everyone here to former SO's right before breakups
---
and so are you
---
Hillmar was wrong, which just proves how clueless he is/was about Eve online. No region-specific resources were removed. Everyone who does industry knows this. That Hillmar thinks they were proved his ignorance.
---
This. This.
---
[removed]
---
Goddamnit you're right...
---
Easy. Cat ears, anime boobs, gacha loot boxes, dailies. All at once.
---
* Completely get rid of bots
---
* Remove passive isk generation in favor of active activities
---
* Reward PVP better to make it easier to sustain oneself without PVE
---
* Fix FW
---
* Make lowsec worthwhile
---
* Make highsec less worthwhile and more dangerous
---
* Remove Asset Safety
---
* Limit citadels per system/per corp/per region etc etc
---
* Introduce a mechanic where the attacker can force a weekend timer to prevent midweek AUTZ tanking.
---
* Get rid of corvettes in favor of free t1 frigate cause corvettes are fucking useless
---
* Generally increase the isk/h of newbro activities to level their buying power in the current economy
---
* Also guide newbros to lowsec pvp as part of the NPE
---
* Add ingame achievements tied in with the activity tracker
---
* Add red timer to Jump Bridges, maybe at 50% of titan bridge timer or something
---
* Improve Logi tools like watchlist and broadcast window
---
* Add Logi on killmails
---
* Also make fucking Trigs invade via null/lowsec towards highsec. Tricks highsec carebears out of their safe ballpit, it allows neg sec status players to enjoy new content, and it MAKES MORE SENSE LORE WISE. You dont invade a country by first droping in its capital with high police density...
---
You sound like someone who just started trading and are mad people are undercutting you. They probably aren't bots; you just have to actually put in effort to compete. Crying on reddit is a bitch move.
---
For enough isk, i can be your spouse/partner/gf
---
Its up to you
---
I've always been curious what a game would be like that intentionally allowed bots. Give people an API and let them try to build the most efficient bots possible.
---
Probably not a good idea for Eve, but still might be interesting.
---
I'll return when plex is back to normal levels. Fuck micromanaging 9-12 chars to have 2-3 chars active for content. What ccp is missing is that content players need even more accounts active to do what they do.. 4-5, 15-18 and so on..  sorry, but eve aint a full time job, it's a game.
---
Undercutting will still happen at the same rate. The only thing your proposal will do is artificially mess up supply and demand.
---
if you did know it was a troll, then you are also aware that they thrive on the salt you give them. but, i know why you complain. you want to get the snowflake brigade together to have a nice group hug followed by a witch hunt. your feelings are the only thing that are important in this world. i am sorry the mean troll got the best of you and i sincerely apologize on behalf of ccp and the rest of the eve community.
---
Ermagerd. Spershurps.
---
&gt;make it harder to gate camp or otherwise
---
Something like gate guns on a timer? If you're in range of a gate for a certain amount of time you get fired on and have to leave for an amount of time before returning to the gate without taking fire? (I suck, just spitballing an idea for implementation.)
---
Who was Provi FC?
---
"Goons are bots", proceeds to post evidence of non goons botting.
---
"I'm not saying goons are bots". You've said that hundreds of times. It's practically your reason for existence. 
---
Honestly, what is the cause of your weird obsession with these guys?
---
Been wondering that same thing myself.
---
This. If you've ever conversed with olmeca in local, it's 100% clear he is legitimately insane. He throws hour long meltdowns in response to casual banter. This level of hatred over a group of people in a video game is just not normal or healthy.
---
I’m going to gank you out of your misery.
---
I’d just split my stack into 6 and list one every 5 minutes. Currently I split my stacks into 5 and list every 60 seconds but it does require speed clicking as I have hundreds of orders to PvP. 
---
Personally I think market PvP is not for you. Have you tried forsaken hubs?
---
Not the proteus, legion or tengu.
---
Is a hotdog a sandwich?
---
If you like cloaky fits I’d look into the active tank neut fit with Ham’s. Land on shit and you can kill it really fast with the combination of neut and selectable ham/drone DPS
---
"Precious little botters" Literally what? The guys in PB don't even pay rent. At least get a basic knowledge of what you're talking about before embarrassing yourself.
---
This whole thread makes me regret knowing how to read English.
---
You are a fuckin idiot an a fuckin major retard.
---
Compayn for CSM.
---
What will I be sacrificing if I am determined to fly a Proteus?
---
No, sir. It's a hot dog.
---
Lol okay so your narrative has now gone from "goons are the vast majority of bots in the game" to "goons are becoming equal with other groups in terms of bots".
---
So if bots are your moral crusade, as you've posted again and again for the precious updoots, how come your entire shtick is camping goons then? If PANFAM has more botters, why not move over there? Hmm it's almost like your whole narrative has been bullshit from the start, and you're too dumb to even keep it straight in your head. Gonna be a big yikes from me dawg.
---
inb4 OPPORTUNITY COST
---
Everything!
---
Literally advertise the game one time, on any platform
---
No lowsec gate to Stain, you've lost me.
---
&gt;Hi Sadic! Do you happen to have some fit examples and maybe advice on how to fly?
---
 zack hemsey - vengeance 
---
:)
---
Lol sry. Its literally only good at scraming and buffer tanking and I think the second got hit with the nerf when they reworked it. So legion is better. Tengu has always kinda sucked at pvp and loki is king shit atm. Super webs solid tank and solid dps. Nvm its the fastest I think.
---
Man you are dumb. It's like every salty post gets dumber.
---
Safe money is gonna be on tears.   Sweet, salty tears.
---
Hilmar is like the average r/eve redditor crying for rebalance of things.
---
They played a little bit a long time ago. Stopped playing and haven't touched the game in years but offers their advice on balance and what to do to fix the game, without any knowledge of the actual  current state of the game.
---
We can start by rebalancing battleship EHP to be good.
---
Not sure it's possible without taking a huge loss as a company.
---
Most games that do really well or are super popular right now involve mini games that last 20 minutes or so. DOTA, LOL, Apex, Fortnite.....people want instant gratification.
---
He can't help it. His entire purpose is to try and hurt goons, despite utterly failing at it. He tries to claim some kind of moral high ground by making it about bots, but to anyone above 95 IQ it's pretty transparent. 
---
If he really gave a shit about botting, he'd have relocated his operations when CCP showed that goons weren't even on the pie chart. Really quite telling.
---
The hardest choices require the strongest wills, and I’m stubborn as hell to stick to ships that use Gallente skills, I had a tough time accepting the Gila as really good for a lot of PvE stuff.
---
&gt; If my enemy is fitted for Kiting, I should match the size of my target. Light drones for frigs, medium for cruisers and heavies for battleships. Otherwise, they might be able to kite my drones.
---
&gt; If my enemy is fitted for brawling/scram kitting, do I just use the heavies? Or should I go for 1 class above my target (medium for frigs, heavy for cruisers)?
---
both are possibly correct, especially for the first scenario, frigates can even kite unbonused light drones, especially hornets and hobgoblins. if you can't bring your opponent under control, your drones are going to be less effective and you won't have the luxury of going one size higher. although, i am not sure about the ability of cruisers and battleships to kite their respective sized drones, i am fairly sure that long range battleship setups don't consider the speed of heavy drones and both ship classes are easier to bring under control than frigates.
---
in case you get them under a certain level of control (scrambler, neuts maybe?) you can consider higher size drones. vexor navy, dominix and ishtar are particularly well suited for this due to their tracking bonus. though it should be noted that webs can actually hurt your drone application by having your drones get under their own guns, and the maths can get funky with gallente drones possibly applying better than minmatar drones, due to lower speed despite lower tracking. without going too much into details though, once you feel you have a handle on your opponent, you'll know if you can bring in the big guns.
---
also on a final note, with a rattlesnake+gecko setup, webbing your own drone can really help with your application. i can't attest to that myself, but i remember zarvox toral (ex-streamer, australian tier pvp personality) being passionate about it.
---
This.
---
OP, what's your in game name?
---
That + removing self sufficient regions or resource scarcity however it’s called, god forbid passive moons even, and bam, you’ve got content again.
---
Haha, Yea, it has been a while since I have done the whole solo thing. My group use to be fairly large so we would just fly whatever. Now that we are down to maybe 3-4 people at best, we have to consider what we fly a bit more.
---
Contacting eve scout is another option rather than self destruction :)
---
Dunno what to say, you've more than proven your worth as an fc during last years campaign. But still, this smells wrong, how can you do worse than boat, the ruler of Asaki, and get demoted enough to leave? I thought you and caish had a good tag team going? Been logged of for a while dough, so i don't know much atm.
---
My memory is terrible, so I'm not sure how much I could contribute.  Maybe looking at my kill board in more detail would help, but a rough look tells me I had about 250 kills on July 8-11 of 2014, all in huola and environs, and nothing for like a week on either side.  So apparently I only took part in four days of the battle.  I'm guessing im conflating burn huola with the seige of arzad and the later Amar seizure of huola almost without a fight (less than a year later, after a lot of Minnies left).
---
Lol, you don't get to pick and choose who you represent. Imagine being this dumb. Mate, you are the epitome of Dunnin Kruger.
---
He’s pretty relaxed and chill dude tbh.
---
So.......”multiboxing” in a single account?
---
Players would actually have to leave their super umbrella to find isk, what a novel concept!
---
I imagine it'd be like an idle game like cookie clicker or clicker heroes or something.
---
 
---
Then you got an out of game bot to manage your in game bots for you.
---
"HTFU" says the guy sperging out because he was called out on his bullshit tinfoil hattery. Nice lmao
---
This is correct. They got "paid" a fat exclusive cheque to keep it on PSN
---
It’s heartwarming to see that there’s other people who are good at getting others out of a fix, even if it’s a total stranger
---
&gt; it was exclusive to a certain console.
---
Dust 514 release date: May 14, 2013
---
PS4 NA release date: November 15, 2013
---
That was another problem.
---
Well it was a VR game to begin with so releasing it on Non VR was largely pointless. This isnt to say they shouldnt have figure out NonVr in tandem with Vr release. Its a great dog fighter but.. Boring cuz its just the same thing over and over.
---
It isnt just VR anymore. Warzone opened it up to all PC. But its kinda a moot point this long after release.
---
Free porn in stations. I remember when walking in stations you could convert video files to play on the screen in the CQ.
---
&gt; Employees are required to play Eve for at least 6 hours/week. Can select between CCP wormhole, null or low sec corp. Corps are by default wardecced by every corp in Eve.
---
Problem is Eve devs can't take place in in-game politics, which this would be. See [The T20 Scandal]9https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/4eeewi/eli5_the_t20_scandal/).
---
What do you mean by 13?
---
&gt; you don't get to pick and choose who you represent
---
Watch me.
---
Color Neocom items!
---
I’d make a completely fresh server. 
---
New characters. New economy. Everyone starts from scratch. 
---
Only thing to MAYBE just MAYBE change to the game is greatly reduce the amount of 0.0 systems. I haven’t played in a few years but most 0.0 systems were empty even while being someone’s sov. Fewer systems might make 0.0 actually feel more alive and like neighborhoods.
---
I’d you were subbed the whole time put a ticket in. I’ve heard f people getting unallocated SP from CCP. Worst case they say no
---
This guy apparently never played SWG back in the day...
---
Why didn't you just ask for that?
---
Please show me on the muninn where the bad Skeleton touched you.
---
Hilmar is clueless.  They didn't get removed.
---
We envy the skill, yup :(
---
"I joined one of the larger groups and literally mined and didnt get fights in 100 man munin fleets, this game is bad"
---
You went the route of alot of people. Join a smaller group or find your own content. As someone who mines, mining sucks, and actually got me burnt out on the game within a month of playing, it wasnt until i found other activites that i actually liked the game. Go grab a couple t1 frigates, go fly in FW space and youll find fights
---
No and I wish I hadn't read this.  Please stop posting.
---
Yea man. Don’t do what makes it a job. I like large scale pve, so I run incursions. Usually make about 150mil per hour so if I play a couple nights a week I can plexus easily AND IM DOING SOMETHING I ENJOY. that’s the key.
---
I spent a full 2 minutes not understanding what was wrong.  Then I looked at your picture,  and laughed.
---
Do you have any proof to back up this claim?
---
A guy placed a tower, someone else ran across it and destroyed it I think.
---
Well first of all the curve to economic stability needs to be addressed so I’d start stagnating markets for beginner to medium tier ships by inflating production.  That should have the effect of lowering mineral prices which in turn will make super cheaper.  Now I just need to get everyone in a cap quickly.  That shouldn’t be too hard with skill injectors.  Oh I thought you meant hypothetically my bad....
---
Hell yea
---
3.499
---
Help I’m a bot and I ran out of ISK. 😜
---
Can I preemptively unsubscribe from your blog?
---
You don’t need WIS for a market mobile game.  Drug Wars was fun on my calculator and you didn’t need WIS for that.
---
r/fittings might be able to help as well on that.
---
No.
---
Thanks a lot for your detailed answer!
---
We should make capitals cost 5x more so that my alliance gets grandfathered into our already existing capital and super capital fleets while everyone else gets fucked.
---
Remove drone auto agro,
---
make Anoms tackle everytime and not instantly switch to the rats potential saviour; the pvper.
---
Give VNI less bandwidth, 
---
delete excavator drones,
---
revamp DeDs and remove them as ascalations from anoms,
---
Expand 6 adm system's vuln window to 6 hours, 
---
increase ADM decay rate,
---
Remove the armor timer from citadels and allow attacker to dictate the day of final timer, 
---
remove MWD from dromi &amp; Sirens, 
---
add fatigue to Jump Bridges, 
---
prevent JBs from being linked only via accesss list (restrict them to I-hub owner again), 
---
Add some form of minor passive income from moons to fund pvp alliances and rekindle moon conflicts, 
---
add +1 LY to jump ranges. 
---
Abandon 'Ban waves' and just ban bots as and when they are found, 
---
pay someone to ban bots all day, 
---
Double the plex cost of skill extractors, 
---
do a short plex sale. 
---
Add a cheaper subsciption option with zero training but all current skills active and available
---
Email former subscribers that no longer play and let them know I'm not scared to break stuff as long as it removes some safety and rocks the boat. 
---
ez pz
---
Bruh, but wormholes are like super hard. Some of us just want a non-tryhard casual experience.
---
Yeah basically. You could even have a PI style screen that gives you a fleet readout with individual screens displaying certain stats and displays for each ship. 
---
Combat would become more chess-like creating new strategies.
---
Clone Commander or something. There would of course have to be certain limitations along with bonuses.
---
I'm thinking a mix of multiboxing/solo FC with a MUCH clearer UI.
---
Just coming up with ideas here.
---
&gt; Space dicks
---
What about truck nuts?
---
That's why the munnin is a thing =).  Alfa through those reps in ~8 seconds (two gun cycles) for an effective 856 DPS.

Bait review
---
3.5/5 Stars
---
Review by u/Vision444
---
Not the best bait I’ve seen, but considering how everyone fell for it, it gets 3.5/5 instead of 2.5/5
---
OP, you suck ass.  
---
  
---
This is an example of a proper review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui7ZTlfNngc
---
Only my opinion, sir. No logs for my conversations with the creators of either hot dogs or sandwiches.
---
Roll the servers back to just after the T1 cruiser rebalance.
---
You deserve Silver
---
Try alt+F4
---
Fixes most problems
---
Wait... Eve has sounds?
---
Somebody mentioned a game like this couple days ago. 
---
Screeps I think?
---
Ask for tons of money from management.
---
Take tons of Money and abscond to a non-extradition country with nice beaches.
---
Or in other words, it is an absolutely non-trivial problem that basically requires massive engineering resources with no guarantee of success.
---
&gt; Hilmar was misinformed
---
man, this is super-diplomatic.  Angling for CSM?
---
you'll find them in Amarr space, spouting the gospel in local

as i know - at least 3 economists are working for them for market watch and ingame isk balance
---
My Corp really doesn’t do any PVP but I’m trying to get better. Currently training into a legion because I’m a fan of drones but it seems like it’s a crap shoot with what I read on the internet ha.
---
Need a way to duel without losing ships. So newbies can learn PvP without losing ISK and feeling bad and alliances can test out how bullshit the damage application is on a moving Nightmare.
---
That's gotta be a no from me dawg
---
not doing all this again from scratch
---
At least they did give a reason to fight for something, and reward holding them/harassing them.
---
I feel this stupid idea is suggested all too often.
---
Short Term:
---
- Make ressources deplete to force groups to spread out a lot lore
---
- Stront based timers for Citadels
---
- Low power citadels have no asset safety
---
- Ship and module balance pass every 2 months to shake up the meta (including capitals, supers and titans)
---
- Improve default overview
---
Long Term
---
- Rework FW
---
- Rework SOV/Entosis
---
- Add more objectives to fight over
---
- PvP missions
---
Beep Boop: You can not stup us. This is our game now. Boop Beep
---
I’ve maybe only gotten 2 or 3 legit solo kills total :(
---
roll back the updates 8 years.
---
certain materials need to spawn in a region for about a month and then switch to a different region.  would drive conflict each month over a different region.  and the first of the month or whenever it spawned would be a mad rush to drop structures etc.

I would have, but playstation exclusive!

... also, pay that one dude(ette? i dont assume) who had that highly-rated recent post with a video of his curved display highlighting the beauty of EvE. And then use that to market things. And stuff like that. Because that was better than half the marketing I've seen out of this game I love. And it was just a dude on a highres display flying around inside a bubble.

For me is making friends  know others peoples  share my experiencies  try to be  there for someone who need it  , i feel sometimes like you but then i  remember got friends on the game i like to talk again and have fun with is not a waste of time have friends

You were involved in a spaceship crash?

if your going to troll atleast research our doctrines to make it convincing.

Don't do it in Jita if you can help it! Local would be better and, even better than that, try group up with another new player in the starting system!
---
Ships which can fit Covert Ops cloaking device don't appear on dscan, right? Have them only appear in local if they said something recently like wormholes.

I work for a lender, lending money to people who need loans.
---
1. Bring back AT (with some visual modifications to make it look cooler) and advertise it everywhere.
---
2. Be more active with cinematic trailers and other videos on youtube.
---
3. More contests with in-game giveaways and prizes.
---
4. Give tools to players/community to analyze suspected botting accounts.
---
Probably, but we find it a lot easier to just talk to the FCs that we're going to be working with directly.

Just started watching your videos recently and was disappointed there ain’t more of them in your YT channel! Love your time lapse / narration overlay

And it was released AFTER the PS4 announcement, which meant people that were willing to buy a console to play it were turned off that it wasn't going to be on the new one.
---
All in combat recons too I’ll bet
---
update the visuals of many ships and empire structures. Seriously, far too many of them are horribly dated and ugly as hell
---
rework the early game, making the missions unique and interesting
---
create a new trailer that makes sense to people who dont play the game
---
add elements to various money making tasks, particularity exploration, that make them more exciting. The few special exploration sites are a good example, but are not enough. I can't believe that most exploration sites are still just approach object &gt; go through rudimentary hacking mini game &gt; collect items

If you guys are allowed to use the "we don't care anyway argument" we can too.

You've fundamentally misunderstood what trading in Jita is like, declared your misunderstanding means there's a bot problem, and turned bitch on Reddit.

You're full of shit or have literally never talked to a successful Jita trader.

How, exactly, would this increase concurrent player count? That is the question, and infinite anoms are not cited as a reason people are not playing.
---
You’re the electorate, if your that upset, vote olmeca gold for CSM like I am
---
I love how you think that a profit driven company uses a more profitable product (WiS) to keep a unprofitable up and running (EvE). No profit oriented entity would do that without a very good reason (like the desire to corner a market, which CCP has already proven they do not).
---
At the end of the day WiS would still be running and functioning as a day care center for eves bittervets. GG
---
And then you create headaches for people who are trying to do their jobs, because when things go wrong, and they tend to do so, then the diplomats, not the FCs, are left to clean up the mess.
---
You only know after the sale. That's pretty irrelevant. Making it more difficult and time consuming is exactly what would help. I don't know how you're in the Hoard and not know this.
---
How do you see that the gate was opened?
---
Is the gate always open in the one-room site?
---
Yes, but he didn't want to do the jobs that needed doing, he only wanted the fun stuff. He was selfish.
---
It gets so much better.  Here is [OP advocating automated Eve gaming in a different thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/b2778n/ideas_for_watching_loc)

I do. I have spoken to virgin and they did tests and said there was no problem their end. Remarkably helpful for a big company.
---
Yeah, that is an awful low number.
---
Very good point. Hadn't really taken that into consideration.
---
Yes, the gate is always open on sites like that one. If you don’t think you can tank the site long enough to get the loot then just burn for the exit
---
I am on LAN. I've never trusted wireless. I  am lucky enough to work shifts, so I can have 4 days at home. It happens at all times of the day. My street is fairly dead thru the day with most people at work, so congestion doesnt seem to be an issue.
---
I've not tried the malwarebytes, but will give that a go.
---
They may have died. I know of at least one instance in which death to timeout did not result in a generated killmail with disconnect. It may have been that they are cleared up without handling for killmail generation.
---
What capital Inflation?
---
I like the idea, sounds hard to implement though. Might as well multivox
---
It would have taken too long to kill. Also the odds of it being from the same corp are highly unlikely.
---
You seam to rate pretty high on the autism spectrum my friend

I think you should get checked out to confirm such

I've tried on sisi but it never seems to happen on there, whatever situation i try to recreate.

You GalMil?

Ye
---
Part of the whole allure of Dust and WIS was having influence over the EVE spaceship universe and all its players. If they shut down Eve down, a huge amount of the appeal of these games would be gone.
---
It happens on all 3 of my accounts, whether they are all online together or separately. 
---
I'm going to try a reinstall today, thats the only thing i havnt done as yet.
---
At least you admit it. What you as an FC saw of BH was a small taste, same with recon. Thankfully you didn't try to drag CD or GSOL into this, or any of the other myriad of groups that make GSF tick. You had your little area, and did not really stand out all that much for good things. You stood out when you griped, which is never the way to go.
---
Yep CCP totally got the wrong message from the Jita riots. People rioted not because they never wanted to see walking-in-stations, people rioted because the rest of the game was being ignored in favor of walking-in-stations. Nobody said "if you ever implement walking-in-stations I'll quit!".
---
The issue was there were serious fires burning and they had the fire department on the other side of the universe using them to build new designer homes. They had resources scattered everywhere except on things that people desperately wanted fixed. They were building walking-in-stations, they were building other games, they were tying in console projects to the MMO, all this really ambitious stuff was going and tons of money being poured into it while the basic day-to-day gameplay was suffering. All people wanted was a token effort to put the fires out, not the complete abandonment of walking-in-stations forever.
---
But CCP's response was "Fine if you want those fires put out so badly we'll just do that instead forever. Since you guys just don't want walking-in-stations, we're going to take our ball and go home. No more building interesting projects like this." And eventually every interesting ambitious project that CCP was working on got shut down.
---
You can't keep a game like EVE alive by constantly being reactionary and putting out the latest gameplay fires forever. Nobody wanted them to do that, that's not what people were rioting about. All anyone wanted was a bit of balance. Maybe put out some fires AND build walking-in-stations. Is that so much to ask?
---
I'm still on 32bit for now. I cant honestly say when it started, but having played for a good few years, its a very recent thing. Nothing has changed in my hardware. i'd say its certainly within the last 8-12 months, but time flies so damn fast, its hard to pin it down.
---
As if people weren't complaining about OGBs back then, or T3Cs dominating in cruiser meta, or *some alliances* being able to drop on people dared to fight in caps within 15 minutes on the other side of the map.  
---
And think about all those absolutely cancerous features CCP added over the years like multibuy and multifit. Like how am I supposed to shit on the guy who would spend all his time in game seeding alliance contracts with fitted ships, that his killboard looks like crap, when he actually does have time to pvp nowadays.  
---
Or not having to stop and restart skill queue after JC.  
---
Or being able to drag pretty much anything from anywhere to a chat as fully functioning link.  
---
Or not having to micromanage fleet structure as FC every second so that the whole fleet would receive boosts.  
---
This list can go on and on.
---
One of the safer strategies is to just orbit the gate at 500m with no prop mod on and send out your drones to kill the Starvings and Tanglings.
---
If you're able to kill those, you should be more than capable of just overheating your prop mod, burning to the box, then burning back. If you can't, then you'll be right next to the gate on the off chance you need to bail out before dying.
---
pvp gila should be around 850 dps
---
Need more Poi Omeca
---
-2 days ago. I start Wednesday. :)
---
well its my second time in such a site, the first time I had managed to kill all the BS and then to take the loot.
---
I came here searching for advice and I got much more then I expected. The gate is always open! So simple.
---
An expansive lesson, which makes EvE great.
---
oh nice, well I hope it works out for you!
---
It used to be wrecks would persist between instances, so it was possible to get the wreck of another pilot.  However, this was a bug.  CCP changed it so after you leave or the 20 minute timer, everything on the grids is reset.  So, what happens is probably your MTU's being removed.
---
Thanks for all the replies and suggestions.
---
I'm going to try reinstalling eve today, see if that helps.
---
big cloaky transport ship that jump long range but no combat capability
---
Just delete them alongside skillextractors/injectors
---
Hit the reset button.
---
I did that during my HSC year, and the couple times I went inactive.
---
I’m at the point where my main can basically pick a sub cap and I can fly it with near perfect skills.

Just have to learn the various specs for weapons, and T2 skills to V for battleships and.

If you honestly do 100% intend to comeback, and you have the expendable income, I would say it is worth it.

Hi there, This is Sadus
---
For the record : THIS IS THE FIRST OLMECA GOLD POST THAT DIDN'T MAKE ME WANT TO SHIT IN MY HAND AND RUB IT ALL OVER MY FACE!
---
We're bringing in renters from around the map and sure, all of the renters from up north and from XIX learned how to bot for ISK.
---
You'll notice that people who bot in Period Basis tend to get reported faster with our rental system and they disappear much faster in our space.   Our rental program is designed to be cleaner, but it's very hard to clean up so many years of learned botting behavior.
---
lol wat. We broke 100 members in fleet all of one time, and it was for a POS bash in Tama when iblob was threatening to take the system well after Brave had gone back to Null. And we were only able to do that because RDRAW fleeted up with us for the first time in forever.
---
Honestly, CCP should make the optimal mechanics fun. 
---
The biggest problem right now is that the optimal strategy is right now to deny fun. 
---
Now all of this I would say comes from linking SP to Isk, making the optimal tactic always to grind more whereas in the past if you had 10 billion in your first week well good luck your still flying frigs, this means that everyone is just looking to do the most of the absolutely horrible pve. ( let's be real here eve pve is all bad like abyssals are the best pve we can get and even those get grinding after like 20 ).

---
Players would have to spread out to gather resources. 
---
This creates an incentive for a player to take a risk. Risk versus reward is a fundamental concept in Eve. Or I should say "was".
---
Right now, null is stagnant.  Entire alliances sit in jump range of each other while able to attain excessive resources. By spreading out resources and creating scarcity, players will spread out.
---
The major alliances wouldn't necessarily be able to be everywhere at once, creating opportunity for medium corporations to squat in space or conduct raids.
---
Small gangs can once again roam null for content. Small content creators can once again flourish and inspire other up and comers.
---
Appreciate this a lot more in the wake of a dino self purge
---
Or have them spawn in a few regions simultaneously, and when its depleted, it spawns in a new region, but the regions are "pooled" so certain materials have higher chances in certain places or whatever.
---
It's more that I have at least a little sympathy for the guy and CCP in general, due to my professional background.
---

So politics aside, any of the interns can share how they do it in this region?
---
When you sign up for eve there's this sort of monitor that comes in the mail. It will monitor your testosterone levels and if you always dock up and run away from fights you get banned from the game.
---
Yeah, I know. That's what I mean, it was Brave that had the 300-400 guys. Galmil brought the heavy armor.
---
Make the change, then eliminate 80% of a persons capitals.
---
In this room aren’t there times when you enter 75-100 km away from the rats and others where you are smack in their ewar range to start?
---
Also, an MTU can be useful if you are in loot/gtfo mode...you’ll just need to get in targeting range to engage drones on the cache and if you’re damped that might mean 35-40km.
---
Yup, fun if you like bots :)
---
I have had the opposite experience with FRT (Though the same experience with TEST renters). Whenever I roll a hole going into FRT/Treasury space, we just roll it again because in USTZ I spent a few days figuring out which bots were together based on their timer on warping to anoms after local cleared, and there are a shit ton. Once you figure out the timers for the characters it's not terribly hard to kill them, but there are so many that it's honestly super disheartening to my desire to play the game.
---
Make aggression more viable.      
---
We are blood thirsty, let us kill.
---
I've never ran these sires. What's the payout/loot you get?
---
Citadels in facwar imo aren’t the issue, it’s the neutral/losing side citadels having no penalty
---
My first introduction to Eve was a banner ad on my old yahoo mail inbox page. 
---
I run adblockers now though so I can't say if that's still a thing.
---
With a normal amount of Leshaks I send Aug Vespas to them then run to the back of the room and loiter while the drones kill them. But THAT spawn, eek I don't know if anyone could survive that. If the Tanglings get hold of you your gone. RIP and I hope the RNG is more in your favour next spawn :)
---
Yeah that was a nice little push, but it involved one Galmil alliance (FEDUP) and reached nowhere near the levels of carnage that home system sieges used to produce.
---
Some of your speed values are incorrect. For example, your sheet says that using MG snakes with an NN-605 is faster than using an omega. I promise you that this is not the case.
---
Congrats! If I was in a Naglfar I probably enjoyed it just as much as you did. :D Always fun.
---
Thank you so much for the advice. It has helped. There is an issue I have been facing.
---
I went 10 or so jumps away from the Dodixie trade hub into .6 to .4 space.  I entered numerous c1/2/3 WH. Then I went another 4 WH deep. All these have corps in them, gas sites, OR the sites have sleepers ( unsecured data site / forgotten relic) and I just cant make money off of them. I am currently training for a [Covert Ops Helios](https://i.imgur.com/uRRUDIy.png), but I feel in a way it isn't really different than the Imicus in the sense that I can only do safe data / relic sites. 
---
A lot of the sites I face have sleepers / NPCS and I feel like I have to fight them to get to the loot. Do i just need to go further out or what? For the last 2 days I have made NO money because all I get are WH with corps in them, has sites, or guarded data/relic sites. Like what do I do to make ISK with this? What am I missing? Do I just need a cruiser with cloak and then just kill the sleepers or what the hell?
---
hey dran can i hunt blue bots
---
pls
---
I'm on board with everything except removing insurance. That's even less ships I can whelp as a lazy player and that means less content for everyone.
---
See, you _say_ that, but I've seen business customers (our end users) try to ask for features that already exist. Features that are well-advertised.
---
Like, it's a big, big fuckin' monster of a webapp that we sell, but this thing in particular, managing user permissions, is like the absolute basics of the thing.
---
The prevalence of caps is due to rorqual mining being dumbass easy infinitely afkable and generally not as irritating to do vs running 3-5hulks and a booster to yield the same ore per h.
---
And insurance paying for 80% of it.  Cmv caps should have less insurance than t2.
---
Alexa, how do I upvote something 1000 times?
---
Although I'd say they did way more damage to FW in particular than anything else.
---
So just replace Eve with BDO is what you're saying.
---
Update: As of 03:30 I've answered and responded to almost every comment directed at me in this thread. I am going to bed. If there are more questions tomorrow morning, I'll answer them. But afterwards I'll need you to forget about me. TIA.

i agree! i wnated to play it but aside from master race blah blah, i dont own a ps3/4...
---
Join test diplo corps.
---
I'm not sure about the latency fix but my bet would be the Malwarebytes too. Then reinstall and if that doesn't work look at your event logs under Computer Management. See what logs are popping up during the time of the crash. Also in the launcher under shared cache there is a Permission and Verify button that you can try.
---
Tackly did the real hard work testing the behavior over the last couple days to make sure beyond a doubt it was a bot, he deserves more credit than me.  Also, no reason to bring irl into it, I don't care where he's from a bot is a bot is a bot.
---
Just block all access apart from new players into those systems. The amount of bad recruitment there is for sure hurting the game.
---
ahhh yeah ok fair enough. I was like surely I'd remember it if we ever managed to put together that many dudes.

Old but a GF
---
I'm looking at it and all I see is you getting smashed. What about it?
---
Players spreading out is great and all, but again, how would this increase active logins?
---
Answer? It won't. You will actually see logins go down because random nullseccer #420 won't have 5 VNIs in system.  While I say this is a good thing, it will actually cause the PvE players to not log in. This will dry up the small gang stuff because small gangs only ever want to fight PvE ships. If they wanted to fight other PvPers the amount of anoms would not matter, they would fight the PvPers, not the krabs.
---
So your idea would do the exact opposite of the intended result, because the mindset of Eve players is to only engage with those who have no hope of winning. If they can fight back, FCs just blueball and go home.
---
Also from a Chinese Corp
---
How surprising...
---
The legion seems decent with the bonuses to neuts. I could see it being good at killing other t3s.
---
Abyssals ?
---
Have you considered graphing the isk/% ratios for each set?
---
eve needs to go beyond Internet space ships. its been all well and good for a long time but times are changing, tech is deeper, people expect more.
---
i would hire an economist again to take a whack at the economy - inflation is a real thing and while vets dont have a problem, new players get whacked in teh face pretty hard when trying to get enough isk to live off of. 
---
walk in stations... i know it may sound like just a demand to know what is past that damn door... BUT - its a level of personal engagement that we dont see, a level that some other games are stepping up to.  perhaps the ability to jump clone via walking into your clone vat, meetup at the bar... pull from what the grand father of eve had where you can get missions in the space port bar, see local news, and shit like that.
---
the changes to aura were a great step a couple years ago - keep iterating on that. teach players more and have more ways for the impatient types to blaze their own path, with out needing to stick to the exact route laid out by the tutorial. most of the questions i answer in rookie help are caused by players getting bored of the intro and skipping it...
---
dont throw away what you have built with eve fest and the AT. even though its a select few who partake - it reaches a large swath of the Internet, there are not many games out there that take things to that level and by not perusing those anymore it feels like the game is loosing steam. your killing yourselves. 
---
finally - the rapid content roll-out is a great idea, but dont be so focused on that new, cutting edge idea to spice things up. we are often pretty good at making our own content so long as the base game is tended to. take more deployment cycles and devote them to fixing broken aspects of the game, making things more stable and balanced. working out how the small and large player bases in eve can both live together
---
Infinitely afkable.
---
I don't think you know what that means. Or else you have never touched a Rorqual.
---
Cool ty now I have a target to shoot for
---
Nothing smaller than dreads, delete all subcaps.
---
Same and on high traffic items ill have multiple sell orders up so there will never be a 5 min wait the moment I'm undercut im back on top
---
Anom Spawn: Bounty payments are modified by a constellations. Constellations with heavy amounts of bounty payments have a reduction. Constellations with with little/no bounty payments have an increase.  
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Citadel Spawning: Citadel amounts are restricted in system by sizes. 'Large Structures' (Keepstar, Fort, etc) are limited to 5. Medium (Astrahus, etc) are limited to 20. Small are limited to 20. Introduce a new structure called 'Invasion Structure' that has a lifespawn of 1 week, only allows docking, one timer 24 hours from reinforce. Infinite number of these per system.
---
Local: Local is now a structure based mechanic. Service module in keepstars, provides perfect local in the system, 10 second delay in neighboring systems. Neighboring neighboring systems have 30 seconds, all other systems have no local. Limit to 5 per region. 
---
Wormhole Static Structure: New structure that uses 10,000 fuel a week and randomly provides a duplicate static from the wormholes available statics. 
---
Misc: Revive the AT. No skill injecting for OMEGA-based skills (whole point was to make it easier to catch up right?). Cynos now take 30 seconds to spool up and can be interrupted by destroying the cyno.
---
Oh yes I like this
---
Some follow up for you.
---
I tried to reproduce the invasion trailer with a stabber and lvl 5 filaments.
---
I succeed on the 23rd try, escaped from leshaks.
---
Nothing happend :)
---
How stupid I am to actually expecting something.
---
You know how stupid this is right?  Any proper market player utilises the 120 orders properly, this includes multiple sell orders for the same item on high traffic items I will have 3/4 sell and buy orders so im always lowest and never wait the 5 minutes
---
I suppose I meant users in a broader sense. Like end user community. I know full well individual users can be dumb as rocks lol.

That Leshak goes 2k+m/s cold

Eve's biggest challenge for it's veteran playerbase is that the time:fun ratio in this game has somehow gotten worse over the years. When I have a dozen other games I could play and have fun (albeit a different kind of fun) in 2 hours instead of roaming through a bot wasteland and getting no kills, it's a fucking huge problem.
---
Friend, you weren't around in the time of small gangs, were you?
---
You get a handful more orders per alpha,
---
and the lack of accounting and broker relation cut into the profit a lot.

make it totally not worth it.

You have the NS dwellers which are the Eloi. What isnt pictured there is the chad Morlock wormholers.

Is this the 2019 version of “Made you form”? What a time to be alive
---
That still leaves the solo and sma gang player with nothing. I'd rather have them bring kitchen sink.
---
Thats probably the stupidest shit I've heard on here since the Op itself,
---
Or,  make new types of capitals that make the current ones obsolete. And make them much harder to make?
---
Reinstate player environments in stations, add strip clubs to said environments.
---
Supers, rorqs, carriers, a few titans, it adds up quick.

That is pretty much this entire subreddit lol.

I had to move some stuff fast once, a few billion over 4 mats, went back a forth dropping the value by a few hundred as fast as the other guy, it happens.

You will need a depot in cargo to use the cache though.

It's hard

Assuming your not just missing some probes or anything. Yes.
---
Not really tbh. Me and a friend just camp Novice plexes and just 2v1 some poor guy
---
Occasionally we’ll get another duo that comes in, and that’s when it gets *really* fun. We usually go “oh shit” before quickly figuring out which target we should focus fire on first
---
And then of course we occasionally get someone who comes in after we took out some poor soul, thinking that it’ll be an easy mop up... only to realize that the 2 remaining ships are allied(me and my friend)
---
&gt;I'm of the opinion that the Starbase Charter mechanic needs to come back for High/Low/NPC Null space Citadels. Scale price up with System Sec and Citadel size.
---
Yes please.
---
What this guy said, plus:
---
* Delete local in nullsec.
---
* Remove asset safety
---
* All structures in a system are tied to the vulnerability windows of the TCU owner. 
---
* Keep stacking penalties on remote reps, allow repping structures and remove damage caps. Apply tidi to auto-repair.
---
* Nerf the ever living fuck out of rorquals
---
* Force all structures in FW space to deny docking rights to enemy faction of system owner.
---
* Generally rebalance FW, remove a lot of the missions and other ways of spamming LP outside of PvP / capturing space.
---
* Make a default UI and Overview setting that isn't garbage.
---
* Release battleground abyssals. FFA, 6v6, AT rules, etc.
---
* Bring back DUST and Valkyrie with integrated co-op PVE across all 3, in things like Incursions, lvl 5 missions, Deadspace, etc. 
---
* Long Term: Hire the best game designers in the world to make it work for integrated nullsec PVP, this would likely dramatically change everything, but yield the dopest fuckin shit you ever did see.
---
passive moons?
---
That was a pretty terrible attempt to escape a gate camp.Why don't I burn straight through the bubbles to a warpout directly toward a fast tackle burning right toward me. What could go wrong!
---
At least to have self recognition to realise that this is just an attempt.
---
Start a new server. You'd probably attract a lot of new players and people that have quit if you created a fresh sandbox for players to build in.
---
CAISH and I had a great tag team going for a while. He was one of the first people in Goons that I considered an actual friend. When we merged Scarebears into Space Ghosts, he disappeared to travel for work and I was none the wiser. That is what led to our divide. Someone I thought was my friend just ghosted me and I didn't know how to react, so I reacted poorly. Now I'm a disappointment.
---
As far as how I did worse than anyone, you'd have to ask the people that demoted me. Still to this day no one has said "this is why you were demoted" and the only reasons I heard were from conversations with people not involved in the decision. The demotion, however, was not what caused me to leave. It was a combination of things.
---
Fix lowsec since it's a easy entryway for all newbie PvP and burn the farms and field meta so empire building won't be the only viable meta
---
No, we want BDO, *in space*.
---
They made null a lot harder to get fights in too, dude. You can't just bubble their undock and go "fight us or jump clone out" anymore, because of citadel guns, just as one example.
---
He\*
---
If they catch on to having blues watch them, I can fill the botting space with neutrals for you and videotape them.
---
Expanding all of the station-based activities to an official mobile game would be clutch. Markets, PI, Industry, Training, access to evemail, chat, corp functions, etc. And then expanding those into more engaging activities, such as puzzle games to speed up research/copying, a PI/Factorio style minigame for industry jobs. more complex PI gameplay.
---
Fuck, even if they could port a client on mobile / tablet, it would be amazing. It might actually force them to rethink and improve the UI.
---
I update orders every 5 minutes...
---
Does it really matter? With the direction of this game it probably won't be relevant anymore in 2 years

Small gangs are dead because no one will take a fight unless they are guaranteed to win. Folks care too much about their killboard honestly. If you want small gangs to make a comeback, stop running away when an equal force shows up to evict your gang from their ratting space.
---
Small gang now is basically a small group of whalers, they won't fight other PvPers.
---
Do you even economics bro?
---
Aha see that's where your wrong! He scouted a Wh once.. Wormholer btw

thanks fam
---
&gt;add ways for newbies to 'steal' wealth from big corporations (high risk, high reward).
---
Moon siphons did this. I miss moon siphons. Moon mining shouldn't have been made a fully active activity.
---
That is easy. Remove rorquals, make it so only a set limit of bigger ships can use a cyno, every ship from noob to ratting carrier shouldn't have a cyno, make cyno jammers actually useful and **reset the server**
---
Username checks out.
---
Ok, here we go.
---
1. Rocks are not close enough to warrant putting 5 drones on 5 rocks. That is pure stupidity to do so.
---
2. PANIC is not a passive module, you actually have to be AT THE KEYBOARD to activate it.
---
3. Ore compression requires the player to right click on the ore and select compress. Guess what, that is not an afk action either.
---
With that being said, I too think Rorquals are overpowered. They would not be though if there was no such thing as injectors. That is the real menace.
---
Truly an epic failure to launch a console only game to pc gamers. I can't imagine how they were so dense
---
best bot, dead bot
---
They definitely need to limit or prevent citadels from FW areas. When those were added it kind of killed any strategy for that. Like just prevent people from placing more, the rest will die over time.
---
Honestly hadn't thought of that. I do know that it straight up destroyed FW though. No incentive for attackers. No advantage for defenders. Led to no more home system pushes, less content, bored PvPers etc. etc. and now here we are today and every major Cal/Gal FW alliance that was active at the time citadels came out are either dead, not in FW, or just barely in lowsec.

Station trader here. I miss the couch in 4-4. Would have loved to get room decorations or a blood raiders lava lamp...
---
You mean like playing on Sisi?
---
I could skip the drinking and the sugary snacks for a few months and have a spare $300.
---
Not only would I feel better, but I'd be able to make swanky EVE videos that would give nerd boners long after I'm gone.
---
Sounds totally doable to me!
---
as someone who is a bit higher up in test and has seen some of the inner workings, i would have expected you to make a better post than this
---
Actually do this for \*certain\* mining anomalies... for fun and profit. T1 frigs count.
---
Anyways, I'm sure their are smarter people than me who could explain why this idea wouldn't work: but I think it would be neat if there were different types of cynos to "mix-up" the capital meta.
---
Light-Cynos would be easy to fit and ignite instantly, but have a mass-limit like 5 or 10 billion kg, just enough to let through a handful of capitals or a couple of supers.  Heavy-Cynos would be harder to fit (maybe BC or BS, or maybe even a new dedicated ship??) and have unlimited mass like current cynos, but have a spin-up time of say 60 seconds.
---
Just a thought.
---
just ignore amadmet
---
probably gonna be in the plex store, just hasn't bee released yet
---
You clearly didn't play eve when it was good. You had to actually do things like explore and travel and the content was an order magnitude more common
---
Correct, being able to bring marines in to keep ticket count up was amazing, it made it so that if you wanted that planet you would take it.  May cost alot but then eve is a economy sim
---
Fuck botting, I'd rather see income stream mechanics in-game that removed the tedium while making things more interesting.
---
Imagine you just anchored a rorqual that auto-mined instead of needing an alt... Just a giant mining bot you can pick up later. Fuck, even make it use PLEX as fuel, just to keep CCP's income stream going. But also let it drop that plex if it dies. So someone can come along and kill your rorqbot for plex if you AFK.
---
Now you have awake, online players tending to, and attacking each other's PLEX-powered robot farmers. What's different from multiboxing a bunch of rorqs? Just the interface, I'd say.
---
And make sure to release it during the dying breath of the PS3.
---
Damn, i liked those few runs i went on with Scarebears. Didn't get to hop into Space Ghosts when those merged, only hanged out in the ingame channel, was planning to join the sig aswell...
---
The only thing I'd want from new space is to make it extremely far away from anything. Worse than drone regions. I'm talking literally out of jump range for all capitals, so you'd have to build your caps in that pocket just like you would for a wormhole system. Or better yet, distortion or whatever makes sure only t1 subcaps can thrive in there.
---
wat
---
Sadly that's the equivalent of a child's book edit for a insult in EvE!
---
I do like salt mining but sadly instead of people using a little thought into their insults they revert to an easier option i.e. Race,sex,kin,self harm etc.
---
But no that isn't just an eve problem, that's a world wide problem. 
---
A simple response to this lovely person should be "Always look on the bright side of life" by Monty python!
---
My thoughts exactly. 
---
That new player who just bought a poorly fit procurer after grinding for hours and hours with his venture will be disgusted to see it blapped.

&gt;Remove insurance

Terrible idea. Insurance adds variability. T1 megathrons or eagle fleet? poor, insure your megathron; rich, use the better ship.

---
fw plexes are already cynojammed. have always been.
---
Unfortunately, Pedron Niall was assassinated before the secrets could be revealed.
---
Send me a computer I can play Eve on.
---
U mean harder to make like titans and supers ? Or something new that will be mass produced in couple years
---
Every single fw system already has cynojammers inside and outside of plexes. FW players should learn to use this feature.
---
* Force the devs to play the sov game as line-members in nullsec blocs. 
---
* Force the devs to do structure logistics for nullsec blocs.
---
* Force the devs to mine, rat, salvage, incursion, datacore farm, etc. 
---
* Add some financial incentive for empires to do war. faucet moongoo towers did cause a lot of content, but it was broken as long as individual players couldn't earn real isk except by making an alliance and embellishing isk from taxes and faucet moongoo. But we need something other than revenge to drive content, replacement for datacores could be one thing, t2 titan BPCs could be another (same as t1 titans but DD reload buff and ability to use another damage type DD). More suggestions welcome. 
---
* Supergates (high range, no need to control the sov to anchor them, but no damage cap).
---
* larger freighters (or some freighter titan class, the amount of shit you need to need to move to do war is insane).
---
* Don't nerf rorquals because the amount of shit you need to establish yourself in a region is trillions in minerals and PI, nerfing rorquals or PI or both would make it impossible for anyone else to make their own delve if they don't have one already (like TEST is close to having). 
---
* NPC region in Malpais. 
---
* Make entire north nullsec into sovless area, effectively a blend of NPC null and wormhole space, because triglavians or sansha invasion or something. This would make the conflict for the southern, western and eastern regions of nullsec more intense.
---
&gt;And eventually every interesting ambitious project that CCP was working on got shut down.
---
Too many things at the same time and now it seems like they've lost that talent/experience to make other things.

Like did you see the Project Nova they showed off?
---
That... That is not what you show off as a "See our new game!" trailer/demo.

That's another level of clickbait, down vote for you Ser. I'm sure the video was probably good. Some of us choose to see it after checking out the BR, it provides some context to the videos.

Maybe built through different mechanisms, based on limited quantities, and not just mining ore, etc... I just haven't thought that far ahead.

This is how responsible alliances should operate
---
&gt;Force all structures in FW space to deny docking rights to enemy faction of system owner.

Why would you join FW after that? It's already filled with frigate alts. There should be huge bonuses to joining FW and not horrible penalties like that.

Really, linking a DCed carrier is the best you got?

Brodog was styling on horde ceptors last night
---
care to explain to us simple folk?
---
I can say from what I've seen in my area of paragon soul, I don't see too many botters that often. We actually have alot of active players in the area.
---
Except this isn't the case and just sounds like more spin, alot of the old NC. FCS are Mia and besides killed bee and a select few others the majority have not been seen how can you claim they are active and running fleets, i mean the simple fact that one of the only major battles that NC have bothered to show up for had you target calling and phoning elo for help?
---
After months and month of SF timing their stuff deep AUtz to prevent us from fighting them, they are deploying to us to attack our assets instead. It's like Christmas.
---
\&gt;Implying Ore Convoys would be a thing. 
---
No. 
---
It'd go to Jita. Be purchased from Jita, and shipped from Jita using already existing Jump Freighter setups.
---
Even on a very basic level, walking in stations is a weird thing to scrap. It doesn't simply represent a huge time investment that got thrown out, it also (IMO) misses the fact that it's *really* hard for players to identify (so to speak) with an egg.  
---
&gt;I think people look back at walking in stations or Dust 514 as some kind of mistake
---
I think they're a mistake, but not because CCP tried them, but because they didn't really stick with it (both in WiS sense, and world of darkness sense) and didn't seem to foresee the problems that ought to have been clear from the beginning (like a console exclusive game launching on a console at the end of its life cycle. I can't say when they started developing it, but they should have realized a console that released in 2006 wasn't going to be around much longer).
---
If someone took over Provi from CVA would Legacy intervene? So wouldn't that make CVA under Goon influence as well?
---
Oooooo I never thought of that, the remove damage cap and allow repping with diminishing returns. Would you adjust the diminishing return rate at all or leave it same as is for ships?
---
I feel like under the virus it should say frat, but seems pretty accurate
---
Looks like snuff still being snuff,  
---
Outnumbering the enemy on their own, but still bring Rdraw and at least one goon alliance on their side for most fights  
---
at least some things never change in lowsec
---
All im seeing is you did steal and have tried to lie about it and cover it up, low as shit
---
The most upvoted comment that actually tries to answer the question doesn't list a single thing that would draw new players to the game, let alone 2x the average player count. Making capital skills non-injectable would even create more barriers for new people to get into the game.
---
Eve's player count graph mostly reflects the changing popularity of MMORPG over time. The fact that it has mostly stabilised since around 2015 should be considered a fucking miraculous success.
---
The fact that the attitude of blaming individual CCP staff and even calling for people to be fired hasn't been stamped out of this community is shameful, and probably more to blame for driving people away from the game than anything listed in this thread.
---
Maybe I got baited on a meme comment, but there's definitely a bunch of people agreeing with this idiocy.
---
Goon leadership are the ones who just put you on their ballot mate
---
The amount of “grrrr Goons” over botting is honestly ridiculous. I know this is hard for some people to believe because “muh narrative”, but the average Goon (like myself) actually fucking HATES bots. I mean seriously, why wouldn’t we? Most of Goonswarm is made up of average guys just trying to make a living. Sure, lots of us have nice toys and live comfortable lives, but having bots around doesn’t do 99% of us any favors. Most of us don’t make big decisions or benefit from VNI farms producing ratting taxes. In fact, bots are actually quite harmful to the average Goon. Whether you’re mining, exploring, or ratting, they kill income potential across the board - so why would we “support” botting? That doesn’t make sense. 
---
And no, Goon leadership doesn’t condone botting. I can cite numerous examples of this. There was an instance where I reported an obvious bot living in my home system to Corp leadership, and they were dealt with not long after. I’ve seen Wibla purge an entire Corp of bots as soon as he became aware of their activities. I’ve seen Chinese corps get kicked as a result of failing to control botting and not meeting compliance standards. Ive seen people get purged and blacklisted for RMT. I’ve seen supercarriers get doomsdayed for botting. 
---
The truth is, most Goonies are honest people. And the honest among us are vigilant and try their best to reign in cheating, but as always, there are going to be bad apples. This is true for ANY alliance. In the end, it’s CCP’s responsibility to deal with botting in a meaningful way. As players, we have limited resources compared to the security team, but in light of this, our leadership does do its best to weed out cheaters. 
---
Flame away &lt;3

I haven't played in over a decade but out of curiosity, what is the current level of concurrent users?
---
An apparent uncontested structure and a carrier. This AAR I give a A+ too.
---
Yeah, a lot of them moved to null and are fighting on both sides of our war with frat
---
Enpl is the only Chinese (fully) Corp in test I believe
---
This list is legit 95% of the solution to the game’s problems &gt;_&gt;
---
To do it properly, there'd need to be a special class of ship with Multi Interface Linear Functioning bonuses.  The new Minmatar "Cougar" cruiser, would get particular bonuses for targeting new players below a certain experience level.
---
A major thing keeping me from starting full-stop is that my progress is tied to character age. It's not the NPE because if shit like Dwarf Fortress has a more stable playerbase than EVE you know it's not getting into it that's the issue.
---
I played ages ago and the main methods of personal progression were through skill points and isk. Everything inbetween is a method of gaining/retaining one or the other.
---
From there you've gotta decide exactly where to spend skill points, as all of the fun in the game requires some investment. Most of these give you a taste but a lot of the combat roles require heavy investment to get to. Do I even know if I'll enjoy those roles? Fuck if I now, but there's months of time invested into them.
---
That's not even starting with things like how the corps doing endgame stuff (nullsec and wh, but I assume there's loads more content avenues now) have reasonable requirements for a veteran, but will likely take a fresh account literal years to meet. Corps dedicated to new players tended to be revolving doors when I played, and as a result were impossible to feel invested in, kinda like a waiting room for the meat of the game -- not something I want to pay to experience for a year.
---
Add in the talk of 3am ops, entire corps that wind up maining in a different games because so much of EVE is logging in to set something to train, and everything above... From someone who hasn't played EVE in at least the past 5 years (likely much longer, I haven't been counting), there's just zero incentive to start playing.
---
I'm subscribed to this subreddit because I like reading about EVE. It seems like it *can* be nice, but there's so many core systems that decentivizes people from just starting. I imagine most player growth currently comes from direct friends of players. Word-of-mouth and advertising aren't gonna cut it with a game that came out ages ago, as most people are already well aware of EVE's existence. Changing the NPE is a dud too, since if someone *really* wants to play a game they will.
---
I think the last time I was honestly excited about EVE was through Dust 514, as the barrier-to-entry seemed much lower. Pick up a gun, shoot some dudes, make isk, and buy an orbital battery from real players? Sign me u--ah, the PS3. Neeevermind.
---
This is a lengthy post that you didn't ask for, so to summarize: as someone who hasn't played in the last forever, it feels like there's too many core systems that decentivize starting fresh to bother starting at all. 
---
I might be completely wrong about all this, but this is how I view EVE from the outside.
---
The NC spin on this post is something else lol
---
lol didn't even think of that
---
I think it would be a great idea
---
There won't be killmarks. Those were unpiloted ships delivered to people then blown up
---
Are you the little red hen?
---
Subcaps only.
---
I'd imagine the locations that the rooms for Abyssal use probably spawn at random, like a signature or anom does.
---
The text appears any time you bug a ship into having too many modules fitted. I guess you could probably glitch a t3c this way by changing subsystems, but what happened here was the t3d had two subsystems active at once. The game noticed something was wrong and removed one of them, but ended up placing it in cargo instead of unfitting it and keeping it hidden like normal
---
Hilmar said eve gets 10k new players per month
---
I remember someone making something similar with snakes and ascendency and in relation with Kikimora speed

I think the greed is good an the $90 monocle also helped make people mad. You are right tho, while walking in stations was kinda bad at launch people were rioting for other reasons

Rework the way player count works. Instead of it showing yhe actual number it should show the actual number + 30k

worst mistake of my life was joining a wormhole corp

Bring back massive meaningful, risky wars. That’s what makes eve hit headlines, and what brought me to the game.

Make the new player experience better by making z-s default overview. The screen pointer links are a great addition as well.

Add a working bounty system.

Wow this got long... TL;DR: the eve NPE needs to be more social, like starting from the first second you are in the game.
---
It's less about making EVE safe for newbies, and more about making it actually make some fucking sense, and have engaging gameplay from when you launch it, to when you actually wrap your head around the whole game. 
---
A kid hears about a new game to play with his friends, they jump on discord and all download it. Its f2p, so he doesn't need to convince parents to buy him anything, or doesn't need to afford it on a broke college student budget. Now we can see two scenes play out:
---
Scene 1:
---
&gt; He boots up fortnite/apex/minecraft/wow, his friends are grouped and partied before he even loads the actual game. There's no real tutorial, the controls are basically the same as most games that are similar. He drops in to the same location as his friends, they all figure stuff out together. They collect some resources, make some progress, and then get mowed over by someone who is good at the game. They try again, and do a little better, and next thing you know they are hooked and paying plenty of money to keep going. However after a while, playing the same repeating game on the same map with the same weapons and the same rules gets boring. They drop the game and move on to the next one. 
---
Scene 2:
---
&gt; He boots up EVE. They spend and hour just making characters, playing with the boob slider, etc. They all make random races/bloodlines that appeal to them. He logs in, and gets dumped into the single player NPE in a random pocket of space, with each of his friends in separate shitshows in every corner of the fucking galaxy. They make it through the tutorial mission, whatever. There's nothing that immediately shows how to even CONNECT with your friends or other players. Some people are bitching in local chat. Theres a corp chat, your friends probably are not in it. You manage to add each other, maybe even form a fleet. MAYBE you figured out how to open the map, much less navigate to the same system they are in. 15 fucking jumps later, you get ganked on a lowsec gate. You get to your system with our friends. You can't do missions together. You're shooting red crosses to make fucking pennies. Affording anything cool on the market is unfathomable. Mining and manufacturing take DAYS. Nobody is helping. Even a small group of friends can't figure fuckall out. Fuck this, lets go do something else.
---
Scene 2a:
---
&gt; One of his friends on discord actually plays the fucking game and directs him how to play, get into his corp, gives him a ship, and sends him out on a roam within hours of booting up the game. The fleet teaches him how to play, and he gets hooked within minutes. He plays eve for the rest of his gaming career.
---
Scene 2b:
---
&gt; He actually doesn't have any friends. He dicks around in EVE for a while, eventually searches for a player corp to join, and plays for a bit. He joined a highsec ratting corp that also rents in nullsec. He farms up for a carrier to rat in. He gets blopsed one day and ragequits.
---
The entire NPE is built around a single-player experience, in a game that's supposed to be an MMO. The key is to immediately allow players to play together, from the second they login, without someone who already knows whats going on to help them.  there should be a big icon in the neocom that connects them with people they already know, an allows them to quickly form new connections with people they meet. It should fucking put you in the same mission with your friends immediately, and let you start achieving things together. Within the first hour of gameplay, a small group of new players should be able to achieve the same equivalent result of the first hour of minecraft, terraria, etc: a little sandcastle they built together. And if they are spawned alone on the beach, they should be able to see all the other newbies there building sandcastles.
---
EVE shouldn't drop a player into their own deadspace pocket. It should drop them right onto a system where every noobie in the game spawns. It should show them how to fight and mine and build a new ship, and show others doing it right alongside. Put it all on one big grid from the undock of the station. Send them on an errand to Jita. Let them see how big and busy EVE is and that it's full of other players to interact with.
---
correct reply btw
---
I, as a goon line member, approve this.
---
Did you bookmark them?
---
Just limit structures to one per celestial. I see no problem with this.
---
Not only is the console not going to be around for much longer, Eve players are, obviously, PC players and, obviously, the PC platform isn’t going anywhere. So why release on anything but PC? Also, I would be logged in way more often if I could have launched Dust games from my EVE client. I think WiS could have been tied into the Dust game as well.
---
*\*\*\*Sarcasm\*\*\**
---
*Great ideea that would make the industrial powerhouses of eve get even more ahead. And the poor people just had their barrier to entry raised so much. I like it.*
---
NO OP bad ideea.
---
it caps out at 999 killmarks anyways, so the exact same as 999.
---
well, honestly most alliances do this if they find this out. even FRT is known to execute botters.
---
but it's hard to say if it's just PR or if the alliance genuinely care
---
Happy Cake Day!
---
Those goons dicks should be jizzing.
---
Missed opportunity, OP.
---
Or give them a 10 seconds local delay, so they can't be used for Plex camping of some sort, but for what they should be for.
---
1. Add a Battleship-class battlecruiser. XL guns on a BS platform. Cheaper than a dread, more mobile, allows more guns in a fight when the fights are all about Supers and Titans nowadays. 
---
2. Get rid of automatic local detection, add an anchorable structure that scans every time a ship jumps in a system that uses a resource. Preferrably one that isn't immediately available locally and is too unstable to be carried by jump drives. 
---
3. Add a structure that allows you to fire a one-use probe (think discovery probes) that upon detonation destabilizes cloaking fields for X seconds at x radius. Does not work on gate cloaks, only ship-mounted ones. Countered by adding charges to the cloak that use enough that you have to be actively managing your ship and not just parking somewhere. (i.e. if you're in a super and you need to cloak after jumping somewhere you'll be fine but you can't just run 20 alts across Eve for hot dropping all day- and the charges should not be irresponsibly huge but enough that you have to use some thought)
---
4. Add deviation to jump drives jumping or bridging to cynos. Lower skills = bigger spreads. Within reason. Base radius = 250KM, reduced 25 to 50KM per level, reduced by module/rig.
---
5. Add rapid cruise launcher for Caldari. 
---
6. Tie anomalies to planets. All these anomalies (like asteroid fields) that are just out wandering in systems and aren't connected to a gravitational body just make me nutso. 
---
7. Add a script to anchorable bubbles that turn the bubble into a hic point, but on a single target. You either anchor as wide (bubble) or focus. 
---
8. Give Caldari ships another pass. Specifically the Recons. Everybody else gets two different role bonuses and Caldari gets one (ECM)- Gallente gets point or web and damp, minmitar gets web and paint, Amarr gets neuts and tracking disrupt. I got it the Caldari bonuses are both for ECM but would be nice to see some non-cookie cutter fits. 
---
9. Add jump field generators for cruisers and battleships. Command ships should be able to mount cruiser sized ones. Cruiser = 8k range, BS = 10k range. Add charges just like disrupt probe launchers. 
---
10. Add regional specific resources for high demand items. 
---
11. This list got too long and I'm too tired to keep going tonight.
---
I’d develop exploration content aggressively, making it narrated, more randomized, and interactive like the new player experience. 
---
I consistently hear positive feedback from players at all levels about exploration. I genuinely think that exploration is a huge factor in player retention and should be a focus for development. There are multiple reasons for this:
---
Firstly, exploration is not *entirely* mindless like level 4 mission running. The sites themselves are kind of interesting, but the variety is sorta limited. They could be so much better with pop-up style narration and fun storytelling, which would set them apart from masochistically dull anomalies. Imagine if there were randomized elements to complexes with different loot rats and obstacles, or even selectable progressions for escalation chains! Random spawns or room layouts would definitely break up the monotony and keep explorers wanting more.
---
Secondly, DED sites can be really profitable! It can provide a comfortable income for the average player with limited play time. This is great for the game, as it allows for realistic progression in a single play session. Lots of players strive to be explorers early on and take pride in finding nice drops. It can catapult a poor capsuleer into a shiny new ship with a little dedication. Who doesn’t want to be a rich explorer, braving the depths of hostile space for the promise of fortune? 
---
Thirdly, and let’s be honest here, the loot drops from exploration sites trigger that nagging human sense of “what am I going to get?!”. It’s the sense that keeps us wanting more. But in this case, there’s a reasonable chance of getting something cool - not like one of EA’s shitty loot boxes. The exhilarating feeling of getting a good drop keeps me interested in ways wallet ticks just can’t. There’s so much potential for improving exploration too. DED 9/10’s could use a loot table with something unique to them, and every faction should have a complete set of 1-10 sites. 
---
I think if CCP went all-in on exploration and purging bots, EVE would be a more popular game.
---
Yeah, your probably right. The whole thing needs an overhaul. LP value shouldn't go up, it should just be more rewarding to defend rather than attack. 
---
Capturing space should force/encourage PVP. There are many ways to do this. 
---
FW should reward active PVP and a dynamic battlefield/warzone.
---
I canceled my sub the month i quit. I had about half a year of skills training when i left. When i came back they were all completed so i'm just gonna keep my head down.
---
Or both.
---
Works great, sucked 18m sp out of my fax alt, bought a titan and used the change to skill into it on my main.
---
If you truly are a new player
---
How could you already knew the nuances of shitposting?
---
Or give them more fitting space and some neut resist
---
And, if it had been a little later targeted the PS4 platform, it would have been a trivial port to PC and Xbone thanks to the current gen move to a common x86 architecture
---
Despite what people in this thread seem to believe, moons were re-balanced. Multiple times. Prior to the re-balances, it was virtually unheard of to find certain moon mats outside of certain regions. If you did find them there, it was highly unusual and was usually 1-2 moons. Technetium for instance was found only in the north. Prom/Dyspro tended to be concentrated heavily in the southwest, but could be found in other places. People forget that before the great tech cartel existed, Dyspro moons were the prizes that alliances fought and died over. 
---
It's also worth pointing out that ratting in nullsec never used to be so lucrative. People would actively rat in vagabonds, drakes, ravens, and tengus. Tackling a carrier meant you got a big boy and you were in for a fight, assuming you could hold tackle. VNI ratting simply didn't exist. If you made 60mil/hr you were doing good. Nowadays, you can't swing your dick around with hitting a rorqual, carrier, super or titan that are making 100mil/hr minimum. 
---
For reference:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/18m14e/solo_nullsec_ratting_20_million_ticks/
---
Well CVA does not actively support anything beyond the direct Provi area. And (i think) they are neither a training camp for legacy nor paying rent to legacy.
---
However, yes, Provi is somekind of a placeholder for legacy. For space that has to be filled but noone wants to fill.
---
Around 20k give or take
---
Agreed. Honestly a lot of things would make them more relevant.
---
Change the culture of the current players and vets. I absolutely love Eve but I don't play because of the culture of people. Don't get me wrong some of the guys and gals I have played with are the absolute best but, I'm referring to mostly the playerbase in null. Which also happens to be some of the most active on here. :/
---
I think it's more that Legacy help stop invasions of Provi due to them not wanting PanFam/DeadCo etc. on their doorstep, rather than helping due to being allies
---
I mean, I like all of your changes but that doesn't help getting the player base up to 50k.
---
Basically the same. If the attackers can out-DPS a full fleet of FAX reps, they would have killed the structure anyways. I'm not 100% sure on this one. I think removing damage caps is a simple method for dealing with citadel spam, but I think there might be better ways, though.
---
It's literally 4 guys from TNT in jackdaws?
---
This is the exact reason why I made this post, I wanted to check myself and make sure I wasn't doing something stupid and rash by leaving 
---
&gt; But creating a social environment where others aren't demeaned, so they can enjoy something you love? That's worth whatever amount of work you're willing to put into it.
---
Exactly. I come to EVE to be that hero logi that stays with you even though you forgot to red-cycle your cyno. I don't come to deal with the bullshit of everyday life. I just want a place I can call home and kill shit.
---
you are no general
---
The tower tanks the rats for you
---
Ah ,I'll poke around on google and see if I can see a maxed out ship
---
You are the only one that is actually thinking about how to get new players to stay. Funny how everyone started to explain things that they would like it to be added to the game but the original task went completely over their heads.
---
I think OP is referring to CCP Falcon
---
Oh but this guy did play SWG back, back, back in the day. The long grind of Master scout and Master Marksman was brutal. Once done with the both of those I was FINALLY able to start training to be a bounty hunter.  But, rejog my memory. Did all the complexity of SWG make it a better game? Or did it holed it back? Did the NGE patch make it more approachable? Even thought the Vet's hated it? or could there have been a balance between the 2?
---
Yeah, duh.
---
5-6 Line members and 2-3 Leaders. Like I said in the OP leaders allow these discussions to flourish and don't stop them.
---
Every Saturday night hisec becomes battle royale?
---
&gt; is as tight as ur mum's ass when she was 19

I have news for him bruh... Make that -6 years
---
I'm trying to talk Summit1G into getting into eve solo pvp, having such a big streamer play eve on twitch would be gigantic, link me your best solo and small gang videos that show the best of what eve offers and I will get them to him to check out.
---
https://youtu.be/h5y81Whnu1w
---
Killmark demo if you would like to watch
---
Yeah, it caps at 999
---
Well shit, you got me there. I just hoped that saying (not a shitpost) wouldn’t get me flamed by everyone lol
---
Thank you!!
---
You fuckers can't even commit to alarm clock ops? No wonder you havent grown the balls to get into a real fight.
---
I think the whole start tutorial and starting gameplay should be completly reworked if they want new people to join. If they make it that from the start you can play with friends that are also new to the game and do starting mission on a semi-safe enviroment with a non intrusive tutorial explainig all the bases (how to fight, mine get a new ship, etc) surranded by only newbies it will make it a much better expirience, the learning curve should be less dramatic and more user frendly with this changes.
---
Help from user to user is no that practical, most people prefer learn how to play with friends they already know or at the very least by themselfs.
---
&gt;" Also, no reason to bring irl into it, I don't care where he's from a bot is a bot is a bot. "
---
Big points for not going down the racist generalisation road.
---
There are several AT ships with max kill marks, as well as at least one Hel. I don't have any of the images on hand unfortunately.
---
* make PvE engaging again. Remove scripted anoms. Replace them with dynamic content too complicated to be farmed by boys and braindead players. Abyssal content is a step in the right direction. Same goes for mining. Elite dangerous has the right idea with regards to mining.
---
* Introduce more raid like content where players need to work together. Replace high and low-sec missions with these.
---
* Introduce more content for small player groups. This is what low sec should be for. If there was content for casual players that just want to log on a few hours over the week and participate in events, maybe I could convince my friends to join me. That is what faction warfare could be.
---
* Make it hard to hold onto territory in Null, and managing a large amount of territory should require enough time and coordination to the point that renting out space to isolated groups of renters is infeasible. Allow alliances against NPC corps, and have said NPCs bean active threat to player owned space. Removing self-sustainable regions is one way to do this.
---
* More WH space for small sub 20 player (not including alts) corps. 
---
Tldr; more casual content for friends which does not require years of SP.
---
Allow the Chinese players to bot.
---
Here is how Chinese ppl do it:
---
1, go find launcher coder
---
2, make launcher player counter +40k in the code
---
3, do the same thing on the server side
---
4, profit
---
Snuff deserves it tbh
---
DUST was a fucking mistake because they launched it on console.
---
I'm just trying to get some experience with fighting novice sites and I get 3 guys warp in and mop me :(
---
The worst are the arty Lokis sitting 40k off the gate.
---
Check D-Scan 24/7 lol
---
Yeah
---
Fighting people with OP blinged out modules is why I hate 1v1
---
I'm 100% with you. It sucks getting yelled at by the FC for not having the SP to fly literally anything they tell me to. I'd gladly fly missions or rat if I could gain SP that way... But nah, I'm sidelined for 3 months until I earn enough for infectors or just wait out the training. Then by the time I get the doctrine, our doctrine changed again. Sidelined for another 3 months.
---
I want to fly, I want to fight, I want to do the things. Unfortunately fun is gated behind the most obtuse leveling system ever invented. At least if fun means flying with others.
---
sometimes you get [lucky](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75973859/)
---
Not often :(
---
I think the whole start tutorial and starting gameplay should be completely reworked if they want new people to join. If they make it that from the start you can play with friends that are also new to the game and do starting mission on a semi-safe environment with a non-intrusive non-restrictive tutorial explaining all the bases (how to fight, mine get a new ship, etc) surrounded by only newbies it will make it a much better experience, the learning curve should be less dramatic and more user friendly with this changes.
---
Help from user to user is no that practical, most people prefer to learn how to play with friends they already know or at the very least by themselves.
---
Other things that I will add is much more PvE content for start accounts to play (with something that resembles a good story arc and fleet actions so newbies get a better feel of how to play this game), walking in stations gameplay to attract more people (it doesn't need to be too deep, just enough for new players to get attracted to the game).
---
I will also change how skills and requirement for end game stuff work but that need more though that I want to give right know lol.
---
time to level up is still too stupidly long for new players, for me to want to operate a carrier it takes what 1 year or two or more, and thats only one type.
---
you want more players you have to stop listening to the old players in regards to levelling they are trying to protect their dominance, their power in the eve universe.
---
otherwise if you want to keep it as is i wont be coming back, too much effort for little return. your service is not a certainty and your business could disappear next year and i still wouldnt have skilled up enough to operate a strong carrier.
---
And whored like a good boy. :)
---
While that player certainly was not nice, you should grow a thicker skin if you plan to play eve some more
---
This is an underated meme, I chuckled a lot when I saw this 🤣
---
keep trying. if it was easy everyone would be doing it. You will learn a hell of a lot and be able to apply that experience in the future.
---
I've got a screenshot of a vindicator with 999 kill marks, I'll link it when I get home
---
Tokenize ISK onto BSV Bitcoin chain, making it essentially a form of crypto.
---
Undo shitadels, Fozzie sov and rorquals.
---
I guess we are fucked, if CCP only has 1 year. Instead, we can make 30k, the new 50k, which is achievable for a few days in September with the release of some new Triglavian PvE crap.
---
Limited cap warfare immunity would be fucking fantastic.
---
unban everyone.    
---
implement hyperstrict stackless python watchdog module within client to catch botters.
---
implement restrictions to "installed applications" list for client that blacklists any client connections from images containing known OCR macro automation suites , to catch botters (sorry isboxer users who dont broadcast)  
---
reintroduce walking in stations.
---
add full suite of content development options for said stations with intentions to bring in Casinos and other vice.
---
Trigs.Sansha,Drifters.Jove yeah, they dont love your structures in their space anymore (theyre gonna try and kill them just like players)
---
Fully integrated on-demand tournament  tools /w broadcasting/commentary/dynamic rule restrictions (ie. Dev powers by the tournament controllers) so anyone can setup anything and have  people show up.
---
Dedicated new player team that actively engages  (dont ask me how, its just an idea)
---
 no more plex, its ISK. Monthly subs will be a market item you buy for isk. (you can purchase isk from CCP directly tho)  
---
NPCS dynamically increase in lethality as you hunt anoms/belts/whatever. (probably a scale-up counter per system according to ratting pressure). Bigger rewards, but youll end up facing dangerous unpredictable foes (like T2 fit hacs /w pvp-grade tactics)  
---
Capitals can go into Highsec, expect the appropriate npc response. (and if youre in a nullsec corp....no more highsec friendliness for you, you get automatic negative security status)
---
Ive got other really mean ideas. give me time.
---
It wasn't released to us.. they just didn't realize who their initial target audience really was going to be.
---
A goat. You will be sacrificing a goat on the altar of Bob and pray for a better Proteus.
---
Your salty
---
Well, step one is roll back to dominion sov system but with structure HP that scales with ADM.  Honestly that's all they should have changed about sov in the first place.
---
Alternative plan.  Put out a giant press release telling all current and former players that if they hit the 50k mark Hillmar will be fired into that volcano no one can pronounce.
---
No idea
---
I just jizzed.
---
Moar guns and/or damage role buffs to bring them about %20 above Assault frig dps would be cool thematically. Better pg/cpu+cap and/or neut resist in addition would make them really fun.
---
I think only Technetium was affected - but i can be wrong (not a miner).     
---
Rest, is as it was.           
---
No clue tbh what Hilmar was talking about.
---
That's fair, USTZ is probably pretty terrible. I've had a lot of fun vs them (filtered to only FRT kills): 
---
https://zkillboard.com/character/202076923/reset/alliance/99003581/
---
But I can play in China primetime during the weekend which probably helps with getting good fights out of them.
---
???
---
Which alliance are you in that doesn't have newbro fits for fleets.... Unironically join karma fleet ffs
---
Did you actually read the tweets? He didn't have an issue with people claiming that goonswarm had botters, but rather that it was a botters haven, or that they're pro-botting. Hard to argue with that when you're by far the biggest alliance in the game, while not appearing on the top 25 list for bans.
---
Yeah.... No
---
Better than being Summer
---
Shitposting is not unique to r/eve.
---
What 'several AT ships' are you talking about that has maxed kill marks?
---
huh?
---
And continue to allow edgelords to speak this way without consequences? The grow a thicker skin narative is getting old. Its victim blaming and regressive to tell people they need to sit through people like this in our community.
---
thats the spirit
---
Probably - provi is a decent non-blue neighbour. They don't attack your sov, your structures, they don't camp you, they don't dreadbomb you or do blops drop on your shiny stuff etc. They might go to GE for a good fight and thats about it. 
---
But if someone else comes along you never know, suddenly you might end up up with blops groups and dread caches on your doorstep.
---
What a chill dude, seems fun. 
---
I would have tried to crash gate there, but he was probably going to get alpha'd before the jump goes through anyway. Sometimes you're just fucked.
---
Lol Vince was doing fleets up to about a 2 weeks ago. The only OLD NC. FC Currently still in alliance and MIA is Travis. The rest as far as I am aware have all atleast pinged for a fleet in the past 4 weeks
---
He's a really cool guy, if you ever get a chance to check out his streams live, I'd highly recommend it.
---
Depends if you want to go outside of Slot 6 or not.
---
no more like wow duelling. 
---
you hit 1 hp you are set invulnerable and duel ends.  Also drones that reach 0 hp get locked in place and invulnerable until duel ends. 
---
the mechanic is already there with some structures. WoW taught me a good deal of pvp with proper duels.
---
You're taking this way too personal.
---
because no newbro would log on sisi and even if their available resources would be shit.
---
Nice fights. One thing to point out, if you shift click a module it toggles the heat status which means you don't have to click that tiny green bar on the module.
---
As bad as it is, my wife plexes three accounts on delve salvage alone. A 1m sp newbee that can barely field a noctis can make carrier ratting ticks ninja salvaging.
---
the BBC got a little longer
---
https://zkillboard.com/related/30005010/201906040600/
---
Yeah and if you want to gank a Rorqual you have to do it in a mining barge or another Rorqual
---
i think it is tbh
---
I mean, the values of my community are a bit more than personal. So no. I'm really not.
---
also ib4 rant about snowflakes because someone in this thread is inevitably gonna be unable to read the phrase "victim blaming" without getting triggered.
---
I think better CPU and PG and perhaps some slot adjustment is in order for sure.
---
So are my fleets but that's my style that's how people know me and now I kick ass I hope to see u on the Battlefield my friend get your alince to undock and come fight
---
Up until about 2 weeks ago, so literally once goons started laying siege to tribute he leaves?  Nice leadership in those FCS there no wonder you had a attention hungry ex goon taking charge
---
I feel like more people should stop wasting their time trying to make it ‚free‘ for them. If plex is too high it just shows that you start to realize your rl time has value.
---
There it is really.
---
i believe they explained the ps3 exclusive choice as being because sony had subsidized their development costs
---
apparently that's a thing, console companies pay developers for exclusives
---
The real truth is Tapi has so many blues they are forced to awox for contents.
---
Thematically I imagine a combat ceptor fulfilling an assassin type role. Get in quick, use high dps to pop a key target then gtfo 
---
Just an upgrade to slots and grid would help but it wouldn't really create enough of a distinction between combat ceptors and assault frigs imo.
---
In an era of instant gratification the glaring reason why most players are likely to quit is the massive wall of skill training they must complete just to try to have fun in the game. 
---
The other one is difficulty in finding small scale pvp content. Getting blobbed by 2-5 enemies when you're trying to shoot at something other than space rocks is pretty boring when you can load up virtually any other game and get into the action. Perhaps you should create a dueling arena and allow bets. Or create areas of space similar to abyssals where 2 players can potentially enter and after clearing a set number rats you'd get loot but the otheres a chance another player enters your abyssal spot and kills you. This at least prevents blobbing while still allowing small scale pvp and pve all in one place.
---
Change Abyssal sites to be like M+ dungeons in Wow. 
---
Allow up to 5 people to run them, have *real* mechanics like extra ships, phenomenon to avoid, missions to complete in them (like someone has to bring a hauler) etc. Have the mechanics set up like M+ where they change week to week and season to season to keep things fresh. Add 30+ levels instead of just the 5 they have now, and add extra rewards for completing the sites within certain time thresholds, increasing the difficulty and number of mechanics as the level goes up. Have a weekly reward as well to encourage people to try them. Add a 5vs5vsAI site using the AI CCP worked on for ages. Set up an AT-style tournament around them as well. 
---
I'd also ideally have integrated this whole thing into the existing faction warfare system especially with the AI but allowed anyone to participate, but that bit is optional.
---
Not all end users are created equal
---
&gt; The most upvoted comment that actually tries to answer the question doesn't list a single thing that would draw new players to the game
---
think about the number of people who've quit eve over the past 5-10 years because of stupid changes ccp made that introduced stupid cancer into the game, that these suggestions revert
---
those aren't new players joining eve for the first time, you're right
---
but that doesn't change the fact that pcu in the 2012 era was 45k+
---
Jita is saturated, trade the null hubs. Or perimeter.

So Vince isnt allowed to take a vacation ? Vince isnt allowed to have a normal life ? Like anyone else? And honestly I dont even know who redline is and didnt even know he was in NC. So yeah he is pretty irrelevant in my eyes. But saying people cannot go on vacations that where probably booked months before because muh eve is pretty sad. Bless your heart
---
ccp falcon seems like a smart guy who knows what's good and bad about eve because half of his fucking job is to read r/eve
---
that doesn't mean he's a wise or judicious individual, just that he can read a few posts before he comments
---
just give them a microjumpdrive with less range(maybe 50KM), no spoolup and reasonable cooldown. solves everything. 
---
They get 'kinda' drag bubble resist by warping to gate, they get  better chances at catching something in a belt by closing distance really fast, and they have something unique.
---
ironically, it does get used - there are people in fw who bait fights on the entrances to fw plexes then warp supers in at range, knowing that they're completely safe
---
it's utter cancer
---
Your on the ama for red so you really exepect me to believe you don't know who he is?
---
And of coarse pre booked vacation impeccable timing might i add
---
Seems to be goon botter.
---
&gt; Nerf the ever living fuck out of rorquals
---
believe it or not, since the most recent nerf, a hulk with max boosts has more yield than a rorqual
---
I mean, the null blocs roleplay well the time. For instance: why should panfam be ever so slightly concerned about the Triglavian invasion of hi-sec while we've got thousands of Goon titans invading our space. The new pve rats aren't a real threat to anyone. It would take them actually taking sov for any of the Nullsec blocs to be concerned.
---
Isboxer multi broadcast is allowed once more.
---
Thank me in action Thinly veiled Hilmar.
---
My recollection is that Sony had to do that a LOT for the PS3 because the Cell Processor architecture was such a pain for smaller studios to build against
---
This is kind of a shame to read, because I've been following Army of Mango and a lot of their available literature (that I can read, to be fair) is heavily anti-bot.
---
Unfortunately it's really easy to get false positives - especially with even mildly attentive VNI pilots. Just look at the two Test Nyxes that died today, they wrote it took at least several days to get full confirmation, and that was for just two toons that have likely been at it a while.

Other alliances watch and learn

I quit.

True sansha Power diagnostic system is worth it
---
I don't give a flying fuck about PanFam.  But you are correct.  They aren't guilty, their renters are.  I think renting is fucking terrible for the game but apparently we aren't treated to a daily thread about it.
---
Remember the Eve commercial were they used a bunch of actual player conversation? Yeah that was fun.
---
&gt; t2 titan BPCs could be another (same as t1 titans but DD reload buff and ability to use another damage type DD). More suggestions welcome.
---
t1 titans can only use targeted dd. t2 titans can use aoe dd. boom
---
I guess we should be flattered that pubbies think we have control over Legacy beyond "Hey guys, wanna help us shoot the dudes that stabbed you in the back?"
---
I was thinking the same thing. This is not the first one of these I've seen recently.
---
"iv said it before and ill say it again"
---
Please don't. You have no idea what you're talking about.

---
From a nullseccers point of view...
---
Bots - Make EVE scan for running processes from time to time. ISXEVE running? HBOT process detected? Automated instaban, no questions asked. No man-hours required in investigations. Bots always ruin the game in the long run and cause steady decline of players that are interested in playing it.
---
Upwell structures - Remove one timer from all non-XL structures. The smaller structures are too affordable, thus too spammable. It should be easier to clear them out. Also this way the low powered M and L size structures could be blown immediately.
---
Upwell structures anchor limit - Citadels only at Gates or Planets. Engineering Complexes only at planets. Refineries only at moons.
---
Asset safety - This only makes sense if players have had their account lapsed for 30 days when their Structure is blown. Just so returning players eventually have something to return to. Otherwise the Citadel should drop all of it's contents for the attackers to loot.
---
I think they would be happy with the most you can possibly run.  More accounts, more money.
---
Of course PBLRD is already on the chart, it is a very old renter alliance. The problem are renters in general, because a botter will most likely choose a renting model where nobody cares about him.
---
If at ANY point FC SHOUTS at you during a fleet, for whatever reason that you think is unfair or unjust - leave that alliance. This is the reason PL lost a ton of good people since Hedliner took over. Being abused isn't a part of the game and enduring it is probably one of the fastest ways out of Eve. There are a lot of groups that will appreciate you, give you proper fits, suggestions on how to use them and when and even give you ships and sometimes isk just for participating. Eve can be intensive during a fight but there is a line no-fucking-one can cross.

Change sp loss from t3's to caps. Problems solved.
---
At least google search what ships goons fly! 2/10 on this bait
---
Loot crates?
---
No I think capitals shouldn't be better at everything that's important. If they had niche roles like most other ships in the game then we wouldn't be having these issues.
---
&gt; Remove Asset Safety
---
how about remove asset safety from dying citadels, but leave it in as a mechanic so people can still use it in some circumstances by choice, like if their citadel gets sold to a hostile they can asset safety their stuff out, or if they're abandoning a forward staging citadel they can push the button, but a citadel that's reinforced can't do asset safety (because interbus don't go to combat zones or whatever lore excuse)
---
if an account is inactive for 90 days all of its assets in citadels should asset safety automatically
---
boom, a realistic asset safety compromise that ccp might swallow
---
since the entire point of it was not having inactive players lose all their shit when their house burns down while they're gone, we add in an automatic function to prevent that from happening
---
but
---
citadels that people use are still pinatas
---
I always wondered about it. Very nice to be able to see it. Thank you very much.
---
If we commit enemy side blueballs, so what's ur point?
---
Webbing your own drone applies more when using Ogres. A gecko has tracking comparable to medium drones so webbing it won't help it's application much. In comparison an Ogre II's tracking is poor enough that it will orbit targets faster then it can track.
---
Nobody stretched it to "nobody in PBLRD bots". Renters bot; this is a fact of life.
---
Mittens found it *hilarious* that despite the constant screeching of random pubbies for years, the *Goonswarm Federation* alliance didn't even make the top 25 of all-time bot bans, and even our rental alliance barely scrapes into the lower end of it because *sometimes, renters bot until they get banned or purged*.
---
You really need to make some room for nuance in your life, dude. There's a gap between the reality of the data CCP has presented and your interpretation of one person's reading of it.
---
just use https://eve-nt.uk/designer/

~~Hire an actual anti-bot team. Start working on all the half finished/abandoned content of the last 10 years. Stop getting rid of the community team at every opportunity.

Sounds exactly like something a spai would say!
---
Lies
---
Frat line members bot their in renter alliance. And this is pretty obvious when every bots name their ship in chinese. 
---
Plus, frat itself bots. You lied about that that they dont bot. Or you may should come frat space more often. 
---
Test dont give rental areas for botters. They revealed to be botters and this can happen to any alliance. 
---
Did test not kick them? No. 
---
And you still put numerous reasons just to blame. Like ‘ oh test kick them only becuz they didnt pay’ 
---
Test line members dont bot,   Nor they bot in their own rental space. 
---
There is always exception ofc, but the amount of botting and attitude of frat and test is far incomparable. 
---
Its pretty unfair and unreasonable to put frat and test on the same line of guiltyness.
---
to be fair, they probably can't tell the difference
---
Ahhh wooly is top fucking notch
---
So are they done fcking up lowsec and gonna move over to fuck up other space as well?
---
The first tweet literally talks about the accusation of "harbouring bots". If you are renting to bots, you meet that criterion. He literally shittalks other alliances for the same thing!
---
I like how these threads get linked in Goon jabbers then tens of spinsters flock here to spin. Gtfo with the spin machine I can't answer to all of you at once lol.

NC. are not transferring any structures hit by goons i can 150% guarantee they are not.

and they havent transferred a structure to somone else in the last 2-3months

Also who wouldn't want a non-threatening farmable nullsec group on their porch? CVA is the perfect punching bag

Revert **all** highsec aggression nerfs. Suicide ganking now gives insurance, facpo is gone, cruiser-sized ships cannot fit BS-sized tanks, freighters have HP shifted back into shield and armour, wardecs cost 2 million, barges don't have massive ore bays, allow boomeranging, increase CONCORD response time, reduce sec status penalty, allow boarding a ship with a criminal timer, stop making Incursion NPCs instantly aggro on EWAR that *isn't directed at them.* Hell, making incursions only reward LP instead of ISK would also remove a large source of inflation (IIRC, it introduces something like 30% of the entire game's ISK while being done by roughly 1% of the player base).
---
Even if I don't complete the goal, EVE is now a much better game, and highsec is saved.
---
allow simultaneous login of all characters on account
---
Poaching renters is fine, but you said you want to specifically attract bots. And i was wondering what your plan was once you have a region full of bots on your hand.
---
Exactly right, how is reverting the game to 7 years ago going to bring back enough players to grow to 50k average players online, when the game wasn't even getting those numbers back then?
---
The notion that if you just put everything back to the way thing were when we had more players then everyone that has quit will flock back to Eve is simply ridiculous. People grow up, they lose interest in the genre or video games altogether, they start families, they get old. The only way to grow the game in a sustainable way is to attract new players.
---
I bought an Xbox360 to play it.  Was I salty when they later made it playstation exclusive?  You bet.
---
Free Stuff, daily and weekly challenges, no risk and reward. Will pull in the casual crowd like nothing else while throwing vets out.

this is how to keep current player base happy,

not how to get 50k daily players

1vs.1 Rorqual on Rorqual @Sun.

It could be bad sense of humor, edgy memes and triggering people is kinda normal in Eve. My wife often give me the "can't believe you said that!" look for saying insanities to my corpmates for instance, but hurting people on purpose is a whole diffent thing for which i don't have any tolerance. Shame your alliance leaders are supporting these morons...
---
If those guys are just a bunch of asshole incels spitting on women/lgbt people all day on a serious note, drop corp/alliance, join their arch enemies and come back to beat the shit out of them. Once their shit gets blown up, wave in local saying they deserved it and enjoy the tons of salt you'll get from them. 
---
Don't be afraid to leave those dickheads and find your true home cause there are decent people out there ;)
---
I sure as fuck wouldnt create a promotional event with the ability to give players something monumental to look forward to for weeks and then crush them on the last day.  That was pretty fucking stupid.
---
Combat ceptors are not the solution, please rethink the direction of your alotted reddit time. 
---
Granted some love could be given to the Caldari and Gallente platforms but overall there are so many other areas CCPlease could shape up the roaming tackle game easily.
---
Id hire some sort of team to interact with the players and organise events. Some sort of... community team.
---
that'd be the most low effort way to increase player count
---
Yeah dumbo did you miss the part where he points out we didn't even make the chart? Jesus, you are such a turd.
---
I actually did the math lately and its not worth it even at scale to run a SP farm at this point in fact the more you scale up the less isk you get so i imagine most if not all are fallow at the moment.
---
You're consistently illiterate...
---
Yeah my very point was gsf not making in the chart doesn't change the fact that imperium is harbouring bots.
---
I may be lurking but help me understand "go there and find the truth by themselves"
---
Find it where? In their history books which were written by the communist murderers? On the internet which is under heavy censorship in regards to this specific event?
---
The very lack of acknowledgment of all the evidence is the best evidence there is.
---
How about something along the lines that whoever owns a system, holds control of all citadels in it? Would make sov warfare a bit or even a lot less grindy. Grinding citadels sucks.
---
Also a system to get rid of citadels in npc space easier.

Hi

I have been trying the 64 for the last couple of days, so far no problems

Was anyone already called a racist and kicked from Legacy for pointing out that this is a chinese only corp ?
---
Join FW. Turn that complex camping into cold hard isk.
---
RR in branch, PBLRD(PLA Associates) in PB, Frat Treasury, Mangos in omist, tapi's only chinese corp, there is a running theme and seeing it makes me a racist which is sad because I like people. ofc XiX/solar/RA are an exception... DOH! I'm being racist again send help.
---
Well done Tapi tbh, FRT and Goons have done similar in the past and also deserve mention.
---
ok liberal
---
I build a time machine and go back to 2009.
---
The thing is that if it takes me more than a year to build a time machine, I can still go back to 2019, and then back again o 2009.
---
i was going to argue that they are still good tacklers until i remembered faction frigs
---
You've already got destroyers for that.
---
&gt; Also fix PANIC so that it cant be chained by multiple rorquals.
---
it can't?
---
Yeah don't fix the clearly useless ship line there is more important things that the single Dev working on this game can do. Good argument.
---
I see what you're saying hence why I suggested dscan immunity in the op.
---
In before he falls out with NC. and the ex-GF posts from his new corp.
---
FRT wasn't on the pie of shame btw, but don't let the facts get in the way of a good narrative.
---
This is also a cool idea.
---
 not true. 
---
it's getting closer but we are not there yet
---
Not to mention that they 3rd-partied or better, just whored, as they also on the Snuff losses. NCdocked bitter as always ...
---
&gt; Problem is Eve devs can't take place in in-game politics, which this would be.
---
CCP devs can make a CCP Dev-Corp. For devs, by devs, just no hacks or use of out-of-game knowledge. A couple 100 dedicated players can provide a well rounded experience if they're seeking it out, which if playing was a job requirement then I would expect them to seek out a well rounded experience.
---
Like they can give any other answer then "yes boss"
---
Congrats for winning
---
Or, maybe, we *don't harbor bots within the Imperium proper* and accept that some botting by renters is a fact of life? Also note that the data CCP presents is for the entire lifetime of EVE, and PBLRD existed previously to 2019. What it spells out is that the Imperium does not contribute to the botting problem at anywhere near the same scale as PL/NC renters have *over the entire life of the game*.
---
Ram jag. All that needs to be said.
---
what? they havent, and wont, and fucking cant transfer structures. its a game mechanic.the type of thing TNT proberly haven't spent much time learning.
---
If TEST and friends didn't want to go shoot NC/PL, then we would not make them. I know it's hard to imagine, but we treat our allies as *equals*, not pets.
---
Bless be the Dinos that stand up for human rights.
---
Ah, so test are indeed allies.
---
   
---
It sounds like someone has a really strong pollen allergy or regularly puffs his nose?
---
&gt;EVE shouldn't drop a player into their own deadspace pocket. It should drop them right onto a system where every noobie in the game spawns. 
---
I agree for the most part..  I see a kind of capsuleer training ground made up of 2-4 isolated systems meant only for rookies, including a separate market.  A bucket list of missions that let you try out simplified forms of all sorts of different gameplay.  Even something that allows temporary use of skill intensive ships so newbs get a feel for that level of gameplay.  A hard cap on how much isk per hour is possible to be made.  And once you feel ready to experience more you move out into regular highsec, transferring all your assets to your chosen border station.  Once you leave that little cluster of systems you cannot return. The Gates are one way.
---
 EVE-lite, if you will.
---
&gt; hell even skillu have botters
---
Negative, the titan dragged to jita was banned for some other EULA violation, by peligro persoanlly, some time ago. He asked to come back to eve, returned, Peligro must have noticed he was back and just dragged him to jita with those others. I don't know what the dude did originally, it wasn't botting or RMT, but could have been something equally reprehensible, I honestly don't know.
---
Patience grasshopper...  They haven't been released yet.  Hoboleaks showed them on the Sisi update a couple of weeks ago, but they haven't hit the regular server yet.
---
Factions don't matter in this game unless you're talking about factional warfare.
---
Totally agree with you there. 
---
On a personal level skill injectors have been great since I'm running all my indy accounts nearly for free.
---
For the game however, they've been horrible imho. 
---
It basically answers the question of what would happen if you could train skills through just playing the game, like most other MMOs.
---
The whole rorqual debacle could've been avoided as well as people wouldn't have been able to spin up rorqual pilots in an hour. 
---
Sure you could make a case for the character bazaar but the supply was never there for the amount of rorq pilots people wanted.
---
And there's the psychological aspect of buying injector 1 at a time instead of grinding 100b or whatever titan pilot cost and having to fork that over in 1 transaction. 
---
Than again, I have no idea what the game would look like now without injectors.
---
Only CCP knows how many players joined and stuck around because they could "catch up".
---
&gt; Or, maybe, we don't harbor bots within the Imperium proper
---
Renting to bots is harboring bots. NCPL *proper* isn't on the chart either. You can't give shit to others and then exonerate yourself when doing literally the same thing. The double standard you're committing here would have been so obvious to a normal person. But if you were a zealous cult member here to defend your space cult against all rationality that's exactly what you'd commit.
---
Also, there are bots in Imperium proper. My own tweet chain responding to Mittens explains reasons why they don't appear in Peligro's chart. In fact, due to Imperium's less selective recruiting, there are probably more bots in Imperium proper than NCPL proper.
---
&gt; botting problem at anywhere near the same scale as PL/NC renters have over the entire life of the game.
---
I agree with this. Doesn't change the fact that you're harboring bots now, and in enormously growing numbers by the looks of it (500 VNI losses in a month wow).
---
&gt; Make them dscan immune like combat recons.
---
Yes more cancer in FW, please !
---
Fun and all but if this is his way of escaping that gate camp, I'd avoid his advice.
---
Bring back iwantisk !!!!
---
&gt; After months and month of SF timing their stuff deep AUtz to prevent us from fighting them
---
"why won't people feed us"
---
This is what people said about assault frigates so CCP fixed them and in the process came very close to making a direct counter against nano small gang with the jaguar (you can make it go as fast as a ceptor and have ADC) Intys are not broken giving them cap resistance, more guns, dscan immunity is not good thinking and is the type of thing dino brains come up with. They warp faster than any combat ship in the game and get point range bonuses! If you think a ship  with MWD sig reduction the ability to point past med neut optimal and falloff be off dscan would not hurt pvp, comrade you need to think more.
---
First the races should be balanced and then once they have done that they can look at tweaking them, currently people only use 2 of the 4 available shouldnt that be the focus of this post rather than saying "THE WORLD IS ENDING GIVE THEM THE BONUSES"
---
I think attacking a single dev is fucking retarded.
---
That was a long ass lost to say you you don't like the new site finder.
---
I thought that the site finder only applied to bad sites in K space?
---
An interceptor should NOT do more DPS than a assault frigate. the PG and CPU would be good

You know if you want to relive the "old" "exploration" feeling, you can just keep the Agency closed...

Alaways awesome to see some nice spreadsheets, pls share!

It's an additional implant, not a replacement for omega though, unlike the NN-600 series. 
---
I mean, the % calculation is neat but it would only be an addon.
---
I'd actually pay ISK for a Virtue set calculation because I'm lazy.
---
Here are three more subtle nerfs that killed the same sense of exploration.
---
1) Pirate POS equipment used to be worth a lot with rare blueprints dropping during exploration. Citadels replaced POS'es.  Nothing replaced those valuable drops.
---
2) Escalating drone region data sites used to be worth something with Augmented Drone blueprints. Excavators inflated material prices, but nobody was willing to pay that much for Augmented drones. The result was that the profit from finding blueprints dropped hard, making the activity unlucrative.
---
3) Offline POSes used to be a great source of pinata stories. Now they are gone, we have structures which you still have to grind two days, and you can't even access loot. 
---
Here used to be a sense of excitement and reward for a person with an educated eye go out in null in an exploration ship and literally discover what's out there. No more. Another victim to the late krabbification of Eve.
---
There it is
---
The thing is: I get death threats and suggestions to commit suicide every week I play eve. This has to do with the fact that I pvp people wo don't expect it. Tensions are high in such a moment and people get emotional and spew out those words while they are upset without really realizing what they do. It's the heat of the moment.
---
Generally scrutinizing the whole player base of eve because of those incidents is a bit extreme in my opinion.
---
I take that you liked all the other ideas then?
---
I think you’re looking for something to indicate your sarcasm, let me help you with your reddiquette. At the end of your sarcastic statement, response, etcetera; type “/s”. Good effort though
---
lol, people sit for hours, siting behind commputer, talking on coms, and updating all their orders every 5 min.  And if you split order into 5 stacks you can update one of your stacks every minute, and so on.
---
The more you do more money you make. 
---
Sure there are bots, but there are humans, that do it too.
---
who
---
I suspect this data is harder to come by even for CCP. 
---
as what makes new players stick is likely hard to tell from a data perspective if you wanna know how shitty the new player experience is right now.
---
go make an alpha and grind a skill injector and you quickly realize if you don't do it via exploration you will hate your life. now realize how many real-life skills you have used to do exploration and out of game tools.
---
Ten second local delay...  
---
... inviting ccp to touch chat code.  
---
You're brave.
---
so he botted
---
The current mission system is a Dinosaur(not a good one, one of the bad ones) , it needs ripped out and totally overhauled, mission agents also need to be spread out to nullsec via player structures and a new service module, lets call it a Bar/tavern/pub which gives the citadel its in, a spot for mission agents to visit and give some missions before moving on to another tavern in the region.
---
The way missions are presented to the player at the moment is just lazy writing, "Hay I dont like this guy over here go kill some shit", "Oh yeah ill give this ammo and some isk for the job" some of them are about as abrupt as that, thats terrible.
---
EvE Is a sandbox, and as such players make up their own shit which is cool, but not all players in mmo's like to do that, some like to be lead down a long winding story with twists and turns where when they hand in a mission their not spamming the next mission button their reading the dialogue to see what happens next, to find out what the action they took did, how did it impact the war, or conflict, and have a logical progression to the missions the further along you go.
---
So yeah I would totally rip out the current mission system and overhaul it, missions could be the hook that brings in all those players that normally slip through EvE's fingers, the players who log into WoW and who love just running round doing quests for all these interesting NPC's with stories behind them and lore backing them up, NPC's you wana talk to to find out whats going on in the world around you, I think this could be applied to EvE, just because it's in space does not mean that it wouldnt be doable the dev's just need to pull their finger out and do it.
---
And I don't think catering to players who love the pve side of the game, who love running missions is in any way dumbing the game down, because none of it detracts from all the sov warfare thats happening, missions don't rob nullsec of content, it removes nothing from null, low or WH, if done well it could bring a boat load of new players to the game, and who know, if they love doing quests/missions how long until they start trying other stuff, and exploring the wider aspects of the game.
---
TLDR : CCP, please totally gut the missions in the game, add more story, more mission types, more rewards, take inspiration from other mmo's that are quest/mission heavy , this wouldnt hurt eve it would only improve it.
---
Fuck snuff
---
Eve's whole skill system is just the most anti fun thing as a new player, i ran into that exact brick wall at exactly the same time ago as you did
---
Just sharing the LOLs
---
This ... so much this..
---
You can access the loot in wspace LP structures
---
I'm not a diplo so I use the word loosely.
---
I know I've seen at least one or two. I've definitely seen a screenshot of an imp out there with that many (though I suppose it could be fake). I'm almost certain there is at least one other, but I would need to do research to be certain.
---
How funny, Hilmar doesnt know this own game (maybe its time for him to get out from the WH he is in)
---
Ok, sure dude, whatever. You do you.
---
Eve needs drop in drop out raids that you can do by fleeting with randoms in low tier space that happen abruptly in highsec, and give good rewards. They should basically drop on a group of new players that happen to be around in the same place (or very obviously spawn somewhere), and then make a system wide broadcast so that everyone can get involved. Triple points for everyone if you manage to save the initial group of players ambushed or something
---
Join forces with SS13 and plug it as the station gameplay experience.
---
I know. I was talking about null. Also, it still requires 2 separate timers which is already beyond the capabilities of a random explorer.
---
No Imp went to 999. Velsharoon's Imp is the only Imp that got to over 1k kills, but it did not reach 999 killmarks.

If that was their intent, it's clearly not working. With X-type hardeners for EX and Therm, I'm still getting like 45\\15% Therm\\Ex on reactive hardeners. Cheesing is definitely possible, missiles aren't really doing anything to change that at the moment.
---
Being former C02 i noticed you do the same with the word "equals" ;P
---
I just keep thinking about Freelancer, walking into the bar, talking to the locals finding new missions , or hearing about some cool lore thing thats going on in the systems around me that I can then go check out.
---
To be fair it has had a lot of work done with it recently so it's fresh and in people's mind. Now would be the best time to implement changes like this.
---
Yup, I just found that myself trying to find the screenshot I was looking for. I suppose things got exaggerated in recalling them.
---
Pretty sure all of CO2's problems started and ended with GigX, rather than anything you night insinuate.
---
Also, wow, CO2 to PH. What a step down.
---
when i get frustrated i just drop my sell orders to numbers low enough that the bot cant profit after taxes. they often undercut me again before someone buys.
---
sometimes you can tell. i stopped selling ecm drones in jita like a year ago because there were 2 orders that would always undercut me any hour of the day. 
---
other items are popular enough that i can sometimes catch sales when few other sellers are not watching, but the item is popular enough that i cant stay lowest/highest order for long. 
---
its not always bots.

Dust 514 is how I got into Eve in the first place, but I didn't get further than the tutorial for whatever reason (my original character is still sat in the tutorial lol) and didn't start playing until last year. I really liked the mechanics of Dust at the time and when I saw a lot of the same customisation stuff is also in Eve, I tried it. Without Dust, I wouldn't have even touched Eve.

I had to abandon a proc in a worm hole once.  Had a astero scout him in, but the hole collapsed before the astero went through.  I went ahead and filled it with ore and left it next to a poco.  Hopefully some one found it and had a isk positive experience out of my misfortune.
---
Why would you even want to go to Stain, it doesn't even have a lowsec gate ?
---
The point is you can't harbor bots to prevent others from harboring bots yet blame them for harboring bots and exonerate yourself from harboring bots.
---
nope

The sad truth of the game.
---
&gt;someone said something mean to me so im going to attack the entire community
---
You need to be very fast and lucky to hunt bots. The align out when you pop up in local.
---
So if you need longer then like 20 to 30 seconds to scram point him he is on a structure tethered already.
---
We try to cath them with interdictors. If we find a botter in sys we find the structure he would warp to make a bm. Jump out of system. Wait then the interd jumps in warp to the bm bubble up. And hope the vni is warping in the bubble
---
But luckily there are enough not bottlers around.

For them you can practice your dscan skill

I have wondered if they could do some sort of walking in stations Sims clone possibly for mobile or PC maybe both.  Also add the ability to build a custom station either on a planet asteroid or simply floating in space as part of that sims clone.  They would show up in Eve Global channels but technically be separate from tranquility.

Well, i didn't go from C02 to Horde. Also horde has been recruiting many old corporations and players (including what was left of C02) so i don't think you really know how horde is these days.

Ah, i see you're trying to make some retarded argument that FRT treasury somehow isn't FRT.
---
Sure thing. So at the time I was hunting in drone lands and I needed a fit that can take on rattlesnakes and other battleships solo. I've tried using a few HAM fits but maybe because they were all cloaky/MWD fit (I was always afraid I'll get caught on a gate) I couldn't get the tank and control (double webs) needed to really take on the krabs in the way I wanted to. Then I found this monster: https://zkillboard.com/character/93886899/ and I thought hey maybe it's time to grow some balls and try the 100mn/double web/heavy missiles fit and just fight everything. And I loved it. The heavies have way better range and better alpha even though a bit less overall DPS and the double webs allow me to kite and kill rattlesnake drones and any tackle that tries to get near me. Scrams are no issue anymore only neuts/webs. Have not looked back to HAMs. Hope that helped my friend o7
---
You don't make a new capital you make existing capitals more killable we have a capital dps platform so let's give it some proper fucking alpha, I mean 10 dreads 1 shot a titan level of alpha now you have to couple this with an increase in cycle time and likely a mineral reduction in dreads. 
---
this means people can go you dropped titans on my fleet fine, where gonna delete 1 of them every time you do. 
---
So people that commit titans or supers to the grid now have something to worry about this should reduce them being committed on everything. 
---
Now this honestly means move anti-cap doomsdays from well titans to dreads, you would get the following roles
---
Carriers / supers anti sub cap there a small gang in a single ship. 
---
Titans fleet support ships they have all the cool AOE utility along with the ability to bridge ability. 
---
Dreads, cap deletion tool they land can delete a capital and die. 
---
this means capital pilots have to be scared of getting engaged as people can commit something that will hurt them, even if they're the biggest boys on the block. 
---
The issue right now is the only way to delete capitals is to commit to the grid with more expensive things ( as dreads are not gonna do the job under fax reps still ).
---
Name your system and I'll take both you on *fire in eyes*
---
there is a small group of amaarian and minmatar rolepalyers that do lore stuff. There are also faction warfare corps that are pretty hard into the roleplaying.
---
years ago there was a group of people that would write the equivalent of a play and then act it out in space for an audience. you could pay them commissions.
---
they had their time with fozzie claws and the gameplay was shit, reworking faction battleships, blops and marauders is alot more important imo
---
Calling someone a dino brain while imagining combat ceptors get point range bonuses... HMMM.
---
1) FIX FW ATLEAST A BIT LIKE PLAYERS SUGGESTED. In the tutorial make a seperate storyline explaining fw and litteraly shove most new players right into fw, have a side mission arch explaining nullsec and lowsec mechanics. SHOVE NEW PLAYERS INTO THAT COMBAT AND FUN EVE ACTION. up all the moons in lowsec. 
---
2) only titans have cynos, but jump range extended 7 light years. you want to drop a hammer you bring a hammer. otherwise move your shit like men. BLOPS cynos remain and u get a special cyno for jump frieghters.
---
3) rorquals lose PANIC completley. 
---
4) anoms die and dont respawn till downtime. cosmic sigs all boosted up in number and some drop blueloot
---
5) you only get 2 actual items to asset safety now. they cannot be titans or supers. 
---
6) all battleships get a tracking bonus and have 300% more damage to super capitals and titans, but take 300% more damage (instablap) from lances and bosons. 
---
7) belt ratting = same if not more isk per hour than VNI ratting (GO OUT AND MAKE MONEY IN A WAY YOU CAN DIE)
---
8) you can reduce all rat spawns by 50% for an hour in a system if a small fleet of 4 to 10 dudes in a gang or some shit can basically capture "plexes" and "command nodes" through a certain system in the constellation chosen randomly each day
---
now go out there and kill and die. welcome back to the sandbox.
---
The really interesting part is to track down the "mains" via api and lock them also out. That's what's more hurt then losing a super ( who is probably already replaced )
---
Countries with lower conversion rates to Euros or dollars have much stronger incentives to bot.

Remove skills (as a mechanic) and restart/wipe clean the server
---
Possibly make skills something that you buy (like the existing books) and remove the time element 
---
Within the first few hours of playing the game you realize that you will never be better than the vast majority of people that have been playing the game for longer than you. While this seems like a fun challenge to most people (including me) that actually enjoy the game, new people see as simply something not worth the effort. 
---
In a game like DOTA or LOL there is always the idea, even if it is unrealistic, that if you practice you can get better or become the best. In EVE however any normal person who doesn't want to take on some leadership position knows that it will realistically take them "years" to do cool shit like fly a dreadnought or do BLOPS etc
---
To most people the game is just not worth the effort or time commitment. It just takes too long before your character starts to feel good or on a even playing field with other people and that is why this game will never be popular to the mainstream
---
I was dead anyway, no point in me being butthurt about it. Also, hindsight is 20/20
---
Bring back passive income but make it destroyable structures and npcs.  Little bits of infrastructure that passing gangs can destroy and loot.  It doesnt need to be too profitable, but it should undermine control of space if you cant keep your space clear most of the time.

I specifically included my beginning story to make a point - I learned part by trying out random stuff and reading guides. Guides already wrote about stuff that works and doesn't. Do X and Z, never Y - because we already tested it for you and new guy will never experience that Y. 
---
So will Agency window will be included in newer guides or advices of veterans to newbies or those who play for a long time, but want to branch into exploration.
---
Like what exactly? What "things"? Because people always say this shit but there's never a coherent answer when prompted for details beyond simplifying the UI and improving defaults.

Unironically get yelled at by a few FCs (hedliner among them) when I was like ~6 months in very nearly made me quit.

Renting to botters and making money out of it is quite the different thing than renting to botters because thats the only way to damage the land lords.

So, I know nothing about capital production. Can you list the ways we could prevent capital production inside the "deep space" region?
---
The obvious first step is a gate that doesn't allow capitals. That doesn't explain how we stop them from being produced, so... any wise ideas?
---
Well, there are a couple of recent stories of people jumping into wormholes and spotting on D-scan unanchored structures or their wrecks with insuring loot pinatas.
---
Add to that only a few ships ingame can pause repair timer solo and they are definetly not suited for exploration that makes it simly infeasible
---
I think CCP has been trying not to cannibalize the core Eve audience with its new ventures.  Like, who's going to take time from their mining and shit-talking local to do an FPS?  Or a VR flight sim?  I think they've believed the new games were a way to bring the Eve lore and universe to different kinds of players.  But an awful lot of the Eve universe is player-created and there's no really good way to get into the lore in pure PvP/MOBA framework.
---
I think Chance has a point - a walking-in-stations game with some PvE missions related to planetary interaction, station maintenance, and Empire intrigue, but giving access to Eve's trading markets.  I can see where that would have an appeal and a path to the Eve lore.
---
Yeah you know, there is actually a way to do that in EVE now. Multiple ways.
---
The way I used to do it was to duel to structure. People agreed to this sort of thing back in my day. It was fun and a great learning experience.
---
Another way is to duel into armor, in which case you have an armor logistic ship repping both ships and the first one to actually catch a rep loses. This is safer, and I don't like being bubble wrapped, so I've never actually done this myself. Besides, I armor tank a lot of my ships (hell, I structure tank many of them, so I usually just duel to the death, but some people like to duel to submission).
---
The third, and most true to EVE way, is to duel in ghetto fits. T1 hulls, T1 modules, T1 everything. People do agree to this also.
---
You're basically whining that a non-sandbox mechanic isn't available inside the sandbox, even though it's available on the test server.
---
Correcy me if im wrong but didnt that one keepstar live solely because test said "no" instead of "yes boss"?
---
Safe space to fly and play the game. NO im not saying make jita safe. Im saying add new space. Maybe 5 systems in each faction. Players with less then x skillpoints can enter. Farm, mine. Learn the games basic functions before gtn blapped into oblivion. By then they have decent isk to recover. 
---
Change skill training. If we all need same basic skills. Why does it take so long to train them. Lower it. Increase times of the more specialised skills. Yes "I had to so they had to" arguement is stupid. My parents had to walk to a library to study. Doesnt mean i do. I have info at my finger tips. Used to take a village to build a house. Now takes a small crew 2 or 3 weeks. Things change. So dont be afraid of eve changing.
---
We want eve to stick around. Need to start capturing younger players and more players. Or everyones bitching and leet attitudes will die with the game we love.
---
Implement rest and websocket API for proper botting interface.
---
Well a big step which has to be taken in order to make 0 sec more dangerous again and simultaneously make botting way harder would be to tie the local in 0.0 to observation structures which have to be anchored at every gate in the system in order to track whos coming in and whos leaving the system with a delay of 10 seconds. This structures can be hacked to disable them for 5 minutes or destroyed with no timers but only damage caps for shield, armor and hull. When one of this structures is missing from one gate, every player coming through that exact gate is not tracked. And if players come through lets say a wh they will never be visible in local unless they chat or take gates. The fuel consumption should be rather ernormous, so that more controlled space means more upkeeping costs and eventually giving up some parts of it.
---
amen to that
---
buff nullsec more so more people go there to rat in peace
---
Don't let the wallet warriors here fool you. They are old and their only joy in life is this game since they no longer can function sexually. So they spend their money on their only hobby, EvE. They also suck at the game so buying PLEX and selling it for ISK is their only way of keeping up with the others. Of course they will tell you that higher PLEX prices are better, oblivious to the fact that many people use PLEX to sub their accounts since they have more important thing to pay for in their lives than a video game. Higher PLEX prices, fewer people playing the game. fewer people playing the game, even fewer playing the game. Without content, EvE is one boring farmville game.  
---
Why do you think number of active players keep falling? It is because anyone with half a functioning brain or a proper life has moved on. Only the bittervets that have spent way too much money and invested decades of their time into this game can't let go and let it all go to waste. So they will never accept the bad-sides of EvE, otherwise it would mean all their investments were meaningless.  
---
Less than a year ago, PLEX cost was half of what it was now. 5 years ago it was third of it. And back then we had 45k concurrent players with no alpha accounts and much less people multiboxing. Hell, this is suppose to be a MMO game where you HAVE to team up with others to accomplish significant things, but some wallet warriors and SP farmers get themselves 50 accounts and play this game like which they like to call ''self-sufficient''. It is as pathetic as having imaginary friends.
---
Test kills Test bot,

doesnt kick from test, nono that would be silly, then they wouldnt sell another super and earn tax from bot.

---
Is this really a problem? Is there really an epidemic of 500k ISK ventures getting ganked in 0.9 systems? Is there really that many people losing &lt;2m destroyers to other players?
---
&gt; Change skill training. If we all need same basic skills. Why does it take so long to train them. Lower it. Increase times of the more specialised skills.

---
I agree with your general point but I think your reasoning is bad. That attitude towards SP inflation is exactly the reason why we're at where we're at now with rorquals and supers.
---
I agree with getting rid of all the pointless fitting/support skills so that you are only ever training skills that let you do new things. Like what's the point of Gunnery, Rapid Firing, Surgical Strike, Motion Prediction, Sharpshooter and Controlled Bursts? Training those skills to 5 (and CB to 4) is a little over 2 months of training that _everyone who ever plays the game_ has to do. It's not an interesting choice, it's just 2 months they have to do before they can spend 2 weeks getting T2 medium lasers.
---
&gt;People forget that before the great tech cartel existed, Dyspro moons were the prizes that alliances fought and died over.
---
Those were the days. We need more of that, except it doesn't need to be quite as harsh as it was. A little more balanced, but still rather unbalanced so that certain regions get a bigger piece of the pie and are worth fighting for, especially if the owners of said piece of pie are hoarding it and driving up the prices.
---
Also, ratting in capitals needs to get nerfed. Not too much, but it shouldn't be SO much better to krab in capitals (except maybe if you siege a dread).
---
How do you produce Praxis ?
---
I mean, show info says it only needs 1 tritanium so I don't get it
---
I was thinking rorquals shouldn't get into those. Too powerful. Put all the ABC ores into anomalies that rorqs can't get to. Exhumers, mining barges, t1 frigates (always, venture lives here), sometimes t1 cruisers, sometimes t1 battlecruisers, depending on size of anomaly.
---
who the fuck is whining here prick?
---
&gt; WH Space
---
&gt; Idea:
---
&gt; WH total mass is always a variable, so you cannot exactly calculate how much mass is needed to close it or be sure that you will move whole fleet.
---
&gt; Effect:
---
&gt; Big WH blocks will slowly crumble as farming smaller WH groups will not be valid so more, and WH space will slowly populate again with small corporations of people willing to live in this kind of space.
---
I have never seen a more thoroughly stupid and disconnected suggestion. For all the posting you do, one would think you would gain just the slightest understanding of certain areas of the game.
---
considering Goons and CVA live by super similar morals, strategys, playstyles.
---
i wouldnt talk down to somone joining Horde.
---
I like the idea of reworking FW for subcap content. I'd like rorquals to stop being used for mining so ubiquitously. I don't think resources should be region *locked*, but region *biased*.
---
I've never had the pleasure of needing asset safety, but it sounds like a load of hogwash to me. I get that taking a break and coming back to your assets all gone sucks butt, but leaving shit in a citadel instead of evacuating it because it's easier and safer is ridiculous.
---
Love it. So Heavys+100MN for range control (and cap sustain), rather than HAM+MWD for raw damage.
---
I can see on that kill the CovOps and Nulli subs in cargo still, do you swap those in when you're trying to get home at the end of the day, and otherwise just charge boldly in and hope you don't crash into a camp? (or if you do hit a camp, literally just #nofucksgiven kill the campers?) Or are there other times when you deliberately swap those subs in while you're moving forward?
---
Ok so the caps go around the smuggler gates. Problem not solved.
---
Anomalies can't be completed by small null groups anymore. Are you sure you are an advocate for the health of small groups?
---
Rorquals just become completely irrelevant 4bil cost boosting ships. Why is anyone going to continue using them when they can use orcas?
---
I thought that killing peoples stuff in wormholes was more dependant on seeding the hole rather than simply moving large amounts of ships into the hole for a quick day trip (owing to the fact that you have to chew through a couple timers to kill it.) How would this prevent that except depending on the luck of the draw making it so that some days you can't move as much stuff in at once?
---
Still not okay.We could make excuses all day, that does not make botting acceptable
---
It's about how smart and resilient you are, not the amount of time that someone has played the game. 
---
For example there are many long time playing ppl who are hardly capable of flying their ship on their own in combat and have to rely on being directed by a FC, even after 10 years playing. 
---
Now some ppl might be smarter than you. Can you ever catch up with them? Yes you certainly can. Many players take long breaks from eve while you're catching up.
---
If anything, having more long time players in the game improves the gameplay for newer players because they have access to excellent teachers/mentors
---
Make it free (alphas get everything a current omega gets) current omega get to chose between double the training speed or training two toons simultaneously at 1x speed.
---
I can't say if this is going to be good or bad for eve in the long run, but in recent months I've seen 5 players burn out because they just couldn't justify paying subscription IRL anymore and subsequently burned out because they were constantly worried about making enough isk till the end of the month in order to pay for ever increasing plex prices.
---
You might be unimpressed by that number, "only 5?", but I should add that I'm not in a large power-block, hence I typically interact with just a handful of people on a daily basis.
---
I'm guessing you and /u/MrTinkell. At first I didn't even realize that you're not the same person, but your "tone" seems to indicate you are being defensive about something, so I'm guessing I hit the nail on the head.
---
As the dude said, who the hell is whining here?   
---
I think this will do great actually, as a new player experience and will allow a lot of things to be tried (again, by the new ones) without fear of losing their hard earned little ships and/or drones.  
---
Why would you think that your super convoluted and ultimately limited workarounds are better is beyond me atm (unless your head is super far stuck up your ass).  Sure you can do all those things if you're the kind of person but having a way to test things super fast without having to fucking reship, hold your last volley, fight in shit ships etc would do nothing but improve.   
---
It's also pretty easy to exploit-proof by just ignoring damage from the duel partner so your beloved punishing sandboxy thing is still on - that someone can pop you if you duel in jita 4-4 like an amoeba.
---
" non-sandbox mechanic " - this just nails your clinical case.
---
First question how would you know that they would be individual concurrent players?
---
No apparently something else  against the rules, not sure what.
---
OK so the way I did it was I'd use my nulli/cloak refit to get from Thera to deep null. Then I'll park my main in some dead system drop a mobile depot at a safe cloak up 3km from it and sit tight while I scan around with my tackle stiletto alt with 15 AU/s warp speed. When/if  I find something I quickly refit and burn there asap hoping there is no camp on the way. Keep in mind I was hitting drone lands/wicked creek which is full of renters/botters so I wasn't very scared of gate camps at that point and I was also checking with my alt as well. I still haven't hit a real gate camp though and I am a very paranoid player and not a good PVPer at all. I am still learning :D

Ye you’re right ofc and I understand that. I’m just throwing out some sarcasm n shit cause the subject gets muddied by people being branded racist for pointing out the demographics involved.

i mean the idea would be like a gold rush scenario, where everybody would rush to a different region every month.  Kinda incursion like, but resource based and would last longer.

---
This is something i will look at a later date.
---
Yeah look how much time people spent in Mass Effect dicking around the bar lounge at the Citadel. And that wasn't even multi-player.
---
And on top of that, what FC can't get creative enough to give this guy a t1 tackle frig or a support cruiser that would amp up the fleet in some way, no matter how small.
---
Had a newbie in my corp who could only fly t1 minmatar frigs, bought him a vigil and told him to paint and web anything we called primary. Best support frigate I have ever had on a fleet.
---
If they launched it on a new console instead of a dying console that would've helped.
---
Probly provi. Lol dont have fit gtfo grid. Ussually how it goes.
---
If you check is losses you'll understand why he's doing this
---
Init still has a staging in Hakonen. Our deployment to Hakonen was simply designed to get that staging established. It achieved that goal. Now we are using that staging to good effect.
---
I can see the console rationale. You want people who have always heard of EVE but had no way to participate to get involved. You want people younger than 35 to get involved in EVE. It makes sense to start making EVE this game different groups play in different ways from different platforms.
---
you never have a single ogre out though
---
I agree with this guy. And /u/looktoyourleft_. And honestly, I don't think bots would compete very well in Jita, judging by how fast a player can gauge whether or not to update the order after double clicking on it, man sometimes I even doubleclicked like 2 extra orders before it registers that I gotta update that one I saw just a second ago. So for 100 orders that's like 1 minute, maybe 2. I don't think a bot would do it any faster when you think about all the processing it has to do to compensate for not having intuition.
---
This is the correct answer.  Vets might leave, but honestly at this point who cares?  Majority of vets have turned into whiny little bitches anyways, so fuck them.  EVE is Ana amazing sandbox and more people need to be brought in; the way to do that is make it easier to get into the game.
---
But they should cap the number of skills injectors you can use in a month, tho
---
There was no running that camp regardless of his direction. Only chance was maybe crashing gate.

Also I poke my nose out of w-space regularly looking to kill honest ratters . Happy to report the botters who escape tackle every single time!
---
Daily reminder plz ccp keep abyssal/instanced content to a minimum thanks
---
But he logged in and did PI for a few hours?
---
At this point a large chunk of enterprise software is a mismatch of new and old code because nobody ever thought it would still be in use 20 years down the line. EvE isn’t unique in this area and they are going to have to work to fix it like many other companies are; I think they can continue to do that. What kills the game will be someday when no one gets angry anymore; we’ll know EvE has been lost.

* played
---
Sadly bluemeleon stopped playing eve :(
---
Gonna let you in on a secret: they were all over, alliances just kept their locations secret.
---
There is - just ignore anything from stainguy
---
You sound jaded and like you are bored. this next part will be hard but why don't you try getting off the beaten path of "most optimal." Try including other people (real people not alts) in doing things finding cheaper rather than more time efficient methods of doing things.
---
It is possible to min/max the fun out of a game. And it sounds like you've done that to yourself.
---
Region-locking more resources **could** be an effective counter to mega coalitions. If you overproduce in your region all other regions would become a bottleneck for your economic output -&gt; you will have to sell cheap and buy expensive -&gt; you can never grow disproportionally. Then again as a nullsec empire you could simply work towards establishing trade-relationships with other regions which could lead to more blueing which sounds even worse that what we currently have.
---
I don't think it's completely insane; a big goal, presumably, was to try and expand the Eve Universe into areas it hadn't been in before, and at the time we're talking about (seventh generation consoles), consoles seemed to be selling pretty well, and unlike many video games, EVE Online just isn't going to be portable to a console system. So, in that sense, it makes sense to try and develop something like DUST for console, rather than PC: they had already tapped the PC market and wanted to tap other markets. I don't think CCP wanted merely to have the same players playing DUST, because, like multiple clients, that doesn't really grow the number of players playing Eve. 
---
I think CCP's problem with Dust is that (and we've seen this several times since with Project Legion and most recently, Project Nova) they're so worried about connecting the game to Eve, that the game just wasn't all that *good*. What CCP really needed to do (and unfortunately I think this ship has sailed), is to A) hire other developers to work on projects they're not familiar with, because it makes no sense to try and develop a FPS in a studio who's only game is practically a spreadsheet and B) focus on making games that, while not directly connected to the game servers, had the EVE feel and setting about them to get people into the universe. 
---
For example, why on earth has CCP never thought to release some sort of RTS set in Eve Online? The game setting seems very suited to that style of game.
---
Further relax enforcement of non RMT related botting. End ban on input broadcasting. Give free 500k sp per month per sub. Pull plug on serenity, allow China acces to TQ without need of proxy.
---
These above measures will easily take online players to 50k, game will be on its knee's after that year however. This is just plan Hilmar knocjed up a gear.
---
Another  bold option would be full server restart with bot ban enforced that would bring game to over 100k online.
---
You do realize, though, that you are literally asking for developers to spend time and resources (that come from our subscriptions or whatever CCP makes money off nowadays) developing a feature (aka potential bug) that is basically the basis for an entire server, which CCP does a darn good job keeping online and market stocked at 100 isk/module. EVE is a cutthroat, social game, and the more bubble wrap you put around things for new players, the harder it will be for them to adapt. There is a reason why one of the tutorial missions was literally just "take this ship and go die" (angel of mercy). That reason is that newbros *need to be accustomed* to losing shit. And if you can't find someone to agree to a duel without death, or at least agree to pay for the ship if they *accidentally* pop it, then you probably shouldn't be playing on Tranquility anyway. And uhh... testing things super fast... very easy on Singularity... import fit, buy all, enter ship, bam, you're in. No matter where your character is on TQ, no matter where your dueling partner is on TQ, you can get an instant teleport to the combat system on Singularity for all of your testing buddies where you can all ship into all the ships you want and test all the things you want.
---
Sure, it's harder to test things with wormholes, but if you live in a wormhole (or are thinking about it) and can't imagine losing a ship, then I got news for you, bub, you're living in the wrong area of space.
---
Please explain.
---
Wormholes?
---
Yes but your other modules do idiot
---
No, he was right on the edge of the bubble. You have a full minute of gate cloak. If he had waited for the crow to burn past on it's orbit, then burned straight out of the bubble with overheated MWD for a cycle or 2, then turn it off and quick warp to something in system, he would've gotten away. Those goons camp the HED-GP gate sometimes and I've gotten atrons through over and over. An inty should be even easier.
---
How do you say VNI in Chinese??
---
There is no miracle thing to do, it is a long job.
---
Two points can help :
---
\- 1) Make translations of the game for spanish, italian, others languages even if it is only for the text. CCP can ask the community for help on this part (give us the files to translate). To get more people connected, you need more customers and to get them, you need to make sure that they can understand the game.
---
\- 2) Make the UI more appealing (give us back the RGB Sliders, etc.), less complex (give us an option for the previous icons for ships in overview), give us the small features who are asked for long but never seen (cancel multiple orders at once, etc.). Content is a thing, but confort is another, and confort is given by the UI. If we have to wait SIX YEARS to get an "Loot All" button for when you loot a wreck, many players will stop because the game seems to fight against them, it isn't confortable. No one want to play a clickfest or use a gloomy UI all the time.
---
If they launched it on a platform that everyone in Eve online actually uses it would still be alive. Launching it on a newer console only delays the inevitable.
---
I have posted on length with regards to the abysmal failure that was DUST. TLDR if they created a captive audience, by making DUST apply a modifier making null sov control/capture easier or harder, they would still have people playing DUST today, in large numbers. Their main failure was not embracing their own philosophy, aka single shard + all decisions matter. They couldn't even make it influence FW properly for fucks sake.
---
They have a hyena. There is no escape unless you are relying on them being potato (which is very possible), but I don't like using this strategy.
---
Cougar Cruiser has a nice ring to it!
---
Would anyone have any good day one Amarr fits for FW? Just made a new alt to try and get a hang of pvp and wanna start oplexing. TIA
---
I'm a bit out of the loop for Nullsec politics. Does this mean Dead&amp;Co and Legacy are allies of the Imperium? According to this Sov map anyways: [https://www.verite.space/maps/coalition/coalitioninfluence.png](https://www.verite.space/maps/coalition/coalitioninfluence.png)
---
This isn't something new, other alliances have done stuff like this for a while
---
oh, the old  "muh development resources"  type of song. :))   
---
You seem to be completely disconnected from what a new eve player looks and behaves like, nowadays. Unfortunately the resourceful, willing to study, gritty players era has kind of gone down if you've lived under a rock since about 2008 or so - people want some quality of life in their games and this feature was supposed to give them just that - an easy, accessible, safe way to test their toys. Sure, sisi exists for testing purposes but having to put in console commands does not qualify as "accessible to new players" even in your most humid, post-cyberpunk dreams.   
---
I still think this is a good idea - a feature that could be put in with minimal effort and will go a long way into educating new players safely, without having to get them into some bullshit "die-reship-warp to fight place" etc, convoluted method and won't change their overall experience as the actual pvp will still have them dying.   
---
so let's all stick to our more-or-less elitist bubbles and agree to disagree :P
---
Cause it was so awesome you spent all your time in Eve and your wife and the kids left?
---
You mean Fozzie Claws?
---
Just like that stress test CCP did a while ago where they just added CPU "players" to reach a certain threshold...
---
Hmm. How about:
---
Hyper Anamorphic Neural Data Yawling?
---
You get a boost like bonus when used with people on your buddies list.
---
we'll see
---
There's plenty of casuals in wormhole space, and Thera is there too.
---
I'm looking at Nova Empire for a similar feel to EVE for a mobile RTS game.
---
I was hoping someone would actually catch that.
---
Was watching live. Fun 10/10. Attitude 11/11.
---
( u/rushlocktwitch )
---
I agree with you good sir. The thing I was looking forward to most was they teased a Station mini game that was chess like that you could gamble and play while hanging out in the station bar with your friends. I cant remember the name of it but I do believe there was video somewhere. 
---
Let me go check youtube.
---
Goons and Test are unofficial blues from whatever we can tell.
---
They aren't technically blue but wont attack each other.
---
isn't the deadline for their deal with Pear Abyss coming up soon? so there's a good chance you won't see him again when it's done...
---
Wormholes have code which allows a indefinite delay - can't be hard to adapt that code - surely...
---
*Brisc wants to know your location*
---
No worries! Glad you enjoyed it
---
honestly if they only implemented dscan immunity without any further changes they would still be quite underpowered for 1 v 1 fw plex pvp - i will happily take on a taranis in my atron and im fairly confident i could take it down.
---
Thank you! I'll be trying to keep up the more gameplay focused content as I find it a lot more fun to make, and it actually takes a lot less time. Sadly it's not really viable for me to sit down and spend 40 hours making a political video each week like I used to :(
---
I had this chick with a Russian accent as an fc once. She yelled at me and now I have a fetish.
---
&gt; 1 v 1 fw plex pvp
---
Yes, someone going to bait using dscan immunity is totally going to go for 1v1 !
---
Yes they are. Legacy and DeadCo each have non-invasion pacts with CFC/Imperium and coordinate with them to fight PanFam.
---
Check singularity at the end
---
Hard disagree on the connection point. Go back and look at all the press and media and blogs about Dust. People wanted to play it BECAUSE of the connection to EVE. It's a killer feature, cross genre game play, that's almost never been achieved in the history of gaming. 
---
People outside of EVE don't care about Eve's IP, ship designs, races. They care about the stories of EVE, the stories you hear about with big wars and massive betrayals and emergent game play.
---
Making a random FPS, even a good one, that relies on the EVE IP but not the Eve server is A MISTAKE.
---
Look at Nova. Game play looked okay but unfortunately it's "just an FPS on top of a ship." But if CCP said "Hey we have this shooter and whenever you win a match some EVE nerd loses an expensive capital ship" it would get a lot more attention.
---
"Remember those stories about 4,000 player wars? Now you can join them on the ground, and whenever you win the enemy alliance can't anchor structures in system for 24 hours." Just examples but you get the idea.
---
I'd say you probably enjoyed it then and if so, my post probably doesn't apply to you.
---
You'd have to give a ridiculously high neut resist for it to matter. With 300 cap you get 1 cycle neuted by heavy neut even 50% resistance.
---
Consumed to much spod
---
There is a implant slot for warp speed that can replace the ascendancy omegas
---
looks accurate, is the perimeter keepstar considered?
---
Boyo needs a tackle titan.
---
Hehe fair point
---
Eve gets enough advertising everytime a "XXX thousand dollar X thousand player" player battle takes place, I would know i joined off the hype from one of these battels many years ago, the problem (and reason im unsubbed) is because player retention is absolute dogshite bottom of the barrel low right now.
---
That's hot.
---
The only targets you will get are actual humans. I think a bubble trap is the only way to actually catch a bot.
---
Shockingly, few reasonable people need to be hassled to not be shitty to friendlies.
---
&gt;Yet....
---
don't do this to me corvus
---
This or something similar to this is what needs to happen: they need something "unique" to be  useful again.
---
They used to be the go to choice for hard(er) tackle, as they could perform Interceptors duty without being paper thin, but now, there's really no reason to go for any of them over an Assault Frigate for that specific role. AFs are way better in everything about performing tackle duty (which, in itself, is a debatable game design choice, but that's another story...). 
---
The 4 combat interceptors need a reason to be undocked again, be it a specific bonus to certain type of module (scram bonus? scram range bonus?) that would make them viable as cheaper, faster, nimbler options of other ships or a new dedicated module like the one you suggest (which I'd love, to be honest). It's truly weird and sad how CCP just went ahead nerfing 50% of the line of Interceptors creating essentially 4 useless hulls from one day to the other, without even giving a single thought about what to do with them.
---
An entirely safe space (skippable) to be used for new players for advanced tutorial. I feel new players hit the tutorial and then say ok what do I do now?  Maybe they run a few missions or they end up high sec mining and get ganked. Or they join on the wrong day and lose everything to burn jita. Many will disagree with this but maybe even an entirely PvE space where newer players can learn more about the game without being harassed by long time players.
---
uhh... wut?

If you’re to lazy to click it, it’s a pretty fancy way to say he has little to no experience in wormhole’s.
---
The hyena and vigils get web bonuses. If he didn't manage to burn out of their lock range with heated MWD, they'll help web him into warp. He burned straight at the only ship he needed to worry about.
---
After a weekend of Colombian marching powder you get a little snuffly cold and the downers.
---
Small gangs are dead because rorquals and botting supers/VNIs are the only thing I can find in 2 straight hours of roaming null.
---
i checked zKill on those two and they were still in test as i posted that message xD
---
I guess you missed the meme here ....
---
I like Jin'taans amazing idea of giving them ADCUs and Merkelchens amazing idea of giving them speed buffs.
---
Id like to see combat ceptors faster at subwarp speeds than fleet ceptors. Also give them the point/range bonuses like the fleet ceptors.
---
Fleet ceptors = bubble immune, acts as a recon ship, good for initial tackle
---
Combat ceptors = actual fast tackle during combat situations, good for sustained tackle
---
Sprinkle in some PG/CPU and trait/slot tweaks and it would be a good start.
---
Not technically correct.
---
Test/Legacy and imperium fight on a daily basis with small gangs/roams.Take a look at the test Goku fleets, these attack anything non-blue that they can find.
---
They cooperate when it comes to Sov (both defence and offence) and tend to how up to each others timers.
---
On the other side of the coin, Panfam/WinterCo and Holy Rental seem have a simular arrangement. I'm not sure who started it first, but at the moment, whenever theres a big timer, everyone shows up :(
---
We saw Legacy promise to help them, abandon them and then return after Provi bled to Legacy.
---
&gt; They don't attack your sov, your structures, they don't camp you, they don't dreadbomb you or do blops drop on your shiny stuff etc. They might go to GE for a good fight and thats about it. 
---
So you basically say that they are dead ?
---
Nah, it was just a shit meme
---
We'd need a complete slot rebalance for that. Claw, Crusader and Taranis all have ass slot layouts for that type of gameplay.
---
You allow input broadcasting again.
---
Pirate frig do that
---
adcu fits more with the definition of combat ceptor - feels like speed buff should be more a thing of the other family of bubble immune ceptors
---
I like this.
---
Do partnership with overwatch of fortnite so you can add some skins in the both games.
---
Soon you will have fluid some where even if it is temporary.
---
Sure. I even mentioned slot/trait rebalances. But it adds distinction to the roles without being a gimmick like neut resist or web resist. Which dont really go along with being a "combat interceptor". It also doesnt nerf larger ships indirectly like EWAR resistance would.
---
Combat inties need a full rebalance if people want then to be viable. Slapping on a gimmick isnt going to do much, except be a lazy bandaid.
---
Stop thinking immunity modules belong on fast ships and delete your reddit account before ccp sees this
---
lol
---
If you manage to tackle a VNI, you can be 100% sure it is not a bot at this point.
---
&gt;but having to put in console commands does not qualify as "accessible to new players" even
---
What? Last time I hopped on sisi you just jumped into the moveme channel and that was that, you're moved, you dock, you fit, you undock, you pew. I can't believe they've made it any harder than that. I still think you lot are asking for bubble wrap, which CCP has very nicely sung as going against the core values of the game (HTFU).
---
We can agree to disagree, but even if I thought it were a feature worth considering, I still think it's a terrible waste of resources that would only serve to further complicate the already convoluted user interface. What would you want, Invite to duel &gt; SAFE? Invite to duel while safety is on sends a special invite? How do you document this to new players? They don't read the dev blogs like we do. They won't know what the difference between a "duel" and a "safe duel" is. I'll give you that enabling the test server isn't exactly "accessible" by modern standards, but you're asking the developers to give you boxing gloves when you already have all the materials needed to make them yourselves. While we're at it, let's seed minerals on the NPC market, why don't we, because it's a lot safer than mining in space and a lot more accessible than having to refine ores.
---
Short run 4 episode Netflix miniseries with a decent budget and amazing story arc that builds into a new player experience but is not obvious about it.
---
If it hits you might have to buy new servers , the key is that it needs to have good actors and storyline that is, outer limits meets black mirror in the blade runner/-alien universe that is eve
---
What you mean 2 mid slots is not enough?
---
As a casual player I think a lot can be gained by focusing more on immersive small scale gameplay. The whole interface, how things are presented, the free camera that feels more like a dev tool than an immersive game client view. I don't think radical new systems are needed to just enhance the sense that you're actually flying in space in a kick-ass spaceship. Just creative presentation and UI.
---
Also like Jester pointed out, more love for non large scale alliance level pvp and industrial scale pve. Focus on the joy of actually exploring space in small groups.
---
I know these are not popular ideas for people with a 'hardcore' mindset who are heavily invested in alliances, like the loud majority in this sub, but those interested in these features are good for CCP's bottom line. They will buy skins and other consmetic shit. And more people is more content which helps everybody.
---
What alliance is SF? :D
---
&gt;Make them dscan immune like combat recons.
---
Horrible idea.
---
See, this is why Dr. Eyjó should have been kept around. We shouldn't have "infinite" resources. You shouldn't be able to overproduce to such a degree that it hurts the economy. The materials should be scarce, not abundant. 
---
As for the trade relationships... Yes, this is called content. It might not be the content that line members are happy with (unless it funds SRP), but it's content that the leaders they follow are happy with. Vote with your corp membership.
---
Im pretty sure this is a bait post.
---
It seems like he scrolled down on Reddit for a few days then put the main complaints he saw into a bullet point list. With clearly very little knowledge on any of the subjects or actual ways to fix them.
---
Same. I'll 2v1, t1 frigate
---
This would only be sad if it happened by accident. A lot of hard work was put into this sphere of influence.
---
Yeh by attack i meant full scale.
---
When it comes down to anythign serious they are blue.
---
That's more like Jerusalem. Enemies living in the same house.
---
Doesn't fix your problem
---
*cries in crusader *
---
This is partly CCP's fault, and partly the tendency of certain veteran players to cluster in groups like NC and PL so they can spend 99% of the game only taking fights that involve them shitting all over massively inferior opponents.  And to make things even better, they loudly protest any attempts to change the system to decrease the power of their groups and especially the degree to which their groups can stifle content almost anywhere in the galaxy.
---
Test awox, best awox
---
dude, i have screenshots proving test isn't blue to goons
---
Definitely, hunters are still in the heighbor system, not visible in local yet. :)
---
What about giving them a probe launcher fitting bonus?
---
it's not an excuse, it's a fact that may explain the trend
---
Don't forget that WiS added no real benefit to the players beyond visual appeal and only served to slow down things they were already used to doing. You were locked into it, it was buggy and crashing some people and wound up being entirely detrimental to the game play experience of established players because its release was handled so poorly. So that was certainly a factor.
---
I’ve wanted to play this game for a long time. However, given how old it is, I’m worried there’s no room for a newcomer. Can anyone let me know if it’s possible to get into this game as a newbie and survive?
---
Its gonna be the exact same thing. People on ebay cannot buy and sell plex and similar without it being against eula
---
soct ships are made of 1 tritanium so they don't insure well as a free ships
---
I think gold-rush encourages too much scripted timed behavior. Why should a set, specific day be designated gold-rush day? It's too artificial. How do you explain that away with lore? How do you roleplay that? Resource based doesn't *have* to last longer, it all depends on how you set the parameters.
---
I mean I get that the FC shouldn't be handling such things at all times. Especially when coordination between multiple fleets happens, the FCs usually have their hands full and it's understandable that this may get delegated to someone else. Being a cunt to your blues however, should never be a thing, no matter who you are.
---
already done ages ago
---
remove all the stupid new stuff of the last 5 years (citadels, injectors, fozzi sov etc.) and just keep all the small changes in that actually improved the game (qol, graphical changes, rebalancing, fatigue etc). just stop throwing out stupid ideas and optimize the core gameplay. a good game will get you players.
---
If you do the archive room yes. But even just Solray + senry room can be super lucrative. Just yesterday i found 3 of them. Did them in Astero. First cache 7m in Solray 120m in Senry, second cache was 90m Solray and 40 senrty , third one was dope - 170m Solray and 240 Senry. With I had t3 or nestor at the time
---
Walking in stations + strip-teasing aliens should do it.
---
For me at least.
---
it was more important to me that we pop the guy's supers on the way out and we didn't want to risk spooking him by kicking him first.
---
Keep on mind the gate is about 90 km from you when you jump in and the leshaks are much closer so if you can tank them while burning there you'll be fine ;)
---
i saw that 6hours later the zkill page i clicked on his own main page, said still in test.
---
kicked from test and a bot cleared. props
---
If you have evidence beyond a quick reaction time definitely DM me on Reddit and we'll look into it.
---
I guess I have only ever done small scale fights as FC so I've been able to do stuff like this, but do most larger alliances not have a jfc or two that could handle getting support ships out to lower skilled players so that they can still join in?
---
The kick was like 20ish minutes after the kills, zkill takes a while to propagate remember.
---
Thing is when you were exploring before you did not know if system/constellation even had ANY signatures. It was always a risk taken jumping into gatecamp/drag bubble without even knowing if there is honey to be had. Now i can just look Agency and see that next system/constellation does not have noteworthy number of sigs any sigs at all - can skip it and go the other way or turn back altoghether
---
I think CCP has long since abandoned the HTFU thing, my dude.   
---
I would say most people expect a "duel" function to work like it does in all other nine thousand mmos out there - a way to get into a "training" fight, where the outcome isn't death.   
---
Eve would still have the caveat that you can be killed by a third party, which can (and does) happen if you fight with onlookers. But, since you have a damn "duel" option on your right click menu - it better be fucking working or - to follow your line of thought - that is actually wasted development time on a feature that no one uses except to move freighters around or to gank clueless day 1 newbies.
---
We were out roaming low sec with 5 of us plus alts. 5 Jackdaws, 1 cyno alt, and 1 dread with insurance about to run up. We cut across a HS like between some LS areas. Jump the gate and saw a tatara with about 15 mins left so we stuck around to see what 2as going to happen. Ended up KM whoring on a DCED than NY that almost got saved. And the tatara. We took a 90 min break, came for the azbel. Could see the writing on the 2 all with all the cyno alts in locale.  I pmed snuff and offered a dread to the blood god. He said sure. The rest is history.
---
10/10 would whelp a dread again.
---
damn zkill and its awaiting to re populate shenanigans
---
lol, great lad, at leat he is honest...
---
We are now longer languishing in Tranquillity.  We have achieved Serenity and we all know where that leads.
---
Two words: mining supercaps.
---
Ok, and? You don't have to look at it for one. For two you can know if a bubble camp is setup pretty easily by looking at the ships destroyed in the last hour on the map unless you jump into a freshly setup one. And for three other aspects of exploration like wormholes and hunting dead poses aren't affected by the agency changes.
---
That depends on the profile of a particular corp/alliance. Some have high-sp playerbase only, some have newbros only, others have both. There certainly should be someone to assist an FC with such things, no guarantees though.
---
Agreed. You have the death of a sandbox if you instance everything.
---
the only full of shit in this was a dragon called sort
---
I bet he would, psychiatrists are a freaky bunch.
---
How many times have you gone out alone in an mwd-fit or dual-prop frigate that could pick its engagements?
---
Nope, they're just not assholes
---
I have had this idea and shared it with my corp a few times, haha.  Hunting the AI controlled alts of the enemy while defending friendly ones would be interesting.  A lot of the PvE is super simple anyways.  Managing a fleet of mining/ratting ships would be more interesting than being one of them IMO.  CCP is not going to completely defeat bots when Eve is an international game and exchange rates are a thing.  If someone can make a middle class living in their country by cheating in a computer game, they are going to do it.
---
We need the same rewards and the same rats but in regular space. That's all that needed.
---
i like that.
---
Spppppop mappppping fppppppun ofpppppp mmmeeeeeeeppppppp
---
&gt; It would take them actually taking sov for any of the Nullsec blocs to be concerned.
---
Oh, i would love so much to actually see them try. :D 
---
Imagine a trig "invasion" fleet getting dropped by 500 titans and 1000 subcaps. 
---
Those poor lads would not last a heartbeat. :DDD
---
Yeah it's a shame. With the speed and tank WITH low sig that some assault frigates have, there's just no use for these. Even the warp speed is minimal when it boils down to very little time difference.
---
\*laughs in legacy code\*

Interesting read... the caldari air defense has me intrigued. I wonder where that is leading.
---
Wait, goon was stranded in the middle of The Imperium? I know with the current deployment, that our security is not the best atm, but still, goons should not get stranded in the middle od The Imperium.
---
Would recommend 10/10 good from the first 30 seconds.
---
Reading comprehension 10/10.
---
Marauders are fine; high sec mission runners.
---
BLOPS are dead because of multiple other reasons. (cheap caps / super umbrellas / VNI-bots / etc. etc.)
---
Faction BS, i actually fail to see the point of those. What are they good for when you can simply buy a pirate BS. How would that rework look like?
---
The sad thing is they tried that before. Those weird moon leechers were a good idea, letting individuals or small groups steal wealth from large entities. ESS were a good idea, letting roamers steal pver's rewards.
---
Both had absolutely shit implementation though and could have been so much more.
---
Happened to me once, did not know about this, so i had to reset to defaults and then reinstall overwiev and all. :DDD
---
So you are talking about ASS-frigs.
---
There was a time when Assault-frigs were ultimate trash. And Ceptors were really strong. (including "combat ceptors")
---
Now you have trash combat ceptors and broken op Ass-frigs.
---
Literacy is hard.
---
As far as we know for certain these are his only two characters, but we suspect he probably has a main elsewhere.
---
End users are great at identifying _themselves_ as the problem
---
So I should buy a lot of them before they go extinct? (love that ship)
---
It does explain it for sure.But it gives botters the "I'm from a low income country card"
---
Assault frigs arent bubble immune like fleet ceptors and wouldnt be as fast as rebalanced combat inties. Nor do they have point/scram range bonuses with reduced cap bonus to point/scram. So no, im not talking about assault frigs.
---
Also, just because things like the ramjag exist now, doesnt mean it'll stay that way forever. Based on previous comments from Suitonia, CCP is aware of the jag's overtuned stats.
---
So people shouldnt keep insisting that the overlap between assault frigs and combat inties would continue indefinitely.
---
what the fuck
---
Dem tears yo
---
Na it's given on a regular basis, I doubt they will go extinct considering each account get one or each variant every end of the year, so before people stop finding them randomly into their hangar I doubt it will disapear.
---
I see your shitpost game is already on point so DREDDIT IS RECRUITING
---
Should, maybe not. Buy them as you need. I sincerely doubt those ships will go extinct anytime soon, as every capsuleer ans their alts basically get a free one during major events, the most recent one being the XVI anniversary.
---
Shoot First.
---
Stabbed VNIs aren't worth the effort. Grab a retribution, load gamma and orbit at 15km
---
ccp doesn't give a crap where you buy the key, as long as its it's not bought with stolen CC etc.
---
Tier skills to ship hulls, max CPU,  power grid for tech 1 frigs/ cruisers only requires level 3/4 skills, same with navigation and most magic 14 skills.
---
More focus on emergent pve, story and events.
---
Fighting in stations
---
Fix insurance -Make losing certain ships cost neutral,  like tech 1 frigates and cruisers, include fit in insurance payout, and have an auto replace/buy tickbox for insurance. 
---
Revamp the courier contracts, add 'lockers' to all systems where couriers can drop off stuff in haulers. 
---
Make the eve gate a permanent entrance to thera
---
So are VNI bots. Fucking bots.
---
Thx!
---
IMO this is what's missing from lowsec and npc null - the "adventure", the "yo check out this sweet spot I found" feeling when you find an unpowered POS, the "jackpot" feeling. This is what CCP needs to add next for low sec IMO, some kind of incentive (preferably player v player) to explore lowsec.
---
I propose that if a citadel is unpowered for over a week, it enters "dormant" mode - if CCP really wants they can keep the reinforce timer, but the citadel should be near useless when dormant - can't dock, only undock if already in. Fuel must be deposited from outside to "wake" the citadel. 
---
In this dormant mode, it disappears from overview and must be probe scanned down using combat probes. 
---
Then, a player can hack the citadel to loot some of it's cargo, could be a random percentage of the total loot. This hack should be 3 to 5 (or even 10 tbh) really hard hacks, that if successfully completed in a row, unlocks the citadel. If failed, it should "alert" the citadel, preventing another hack attempt for say, an hour. Maybe make it so this reveals the citadel on overview to increase tension.
---
Can you recommend a decent BS fit for solo invasion?
---
Congratulations! You have made yourself unemployable in the game review business! :)
---
Yeah seems like everyone's boring now. I usually go out in a kestrel if I feel like some facwar, but there's been little point to it lately.
---
Serious question: how are the botters automating whatever they are doing?
---
Short answer, the game is designed so that new players have plenty of activities and economic roles they can furfil with cheap ships, low skill points and yet still be useful and enjoy the game. I've started the game using a small tackle frigate for my alliance and go ton of fun catching bigger ship that my friends could kill.
---
How to get kited to death in one easy step
---
In all 3 instances you mention isk, not exploration. If isk is the goal, aren't there more profitable mechanics in the game?
---

---
Indeed test not being blue to goons is a meme at this point.Since the FC tells you who to shoot,colors don't really matter
---
Hello fellow FORTRAN/COBAL programmer......shit that was more than 20 years ago, fug.
---
It's still against eula and if they decide to they absolute can ban you for breaking their eula.
---
This is fucking dope dude thank you
---
The Taranis isn't as bad as people think. Assault frigs do the ongrid tackle role far better, but the Taranis does have the advantage of a MUCH higher base warp speed. Throw on a hyperspatial and you've got a more durable, higher damage Ares that has the disadvantage of not being nullified.
---
Okay, so how's that apply in lowsec?
---
Or in space where you KNOW the opposition has no defensive bubbles?
---
It doesn't.
---
These things have a use.
---
The OTHER combat ceptors are \_COMPLETE SHIT\_ right now and need major buffs.
---
Pretty much anything above 800 tank and a web would do, drone boats are not recommended because the system effects
---
And yes, perimeter systems only
---
so non consensual pvp makes you an asshole you say ?
---
Capital umbrellas are strangling the life from this game. Nullsec shouldn't be able to get that safe.
---
I'm sure CCP realises it by now. Question is, will they do anything about it.
---
You do realize that you can max out the skills for flying most cruiser roles in just a few months, right? Characters with high SP are just capable of flying more types of ships. Even capital skills have caps. Bigger ships are not strictly better, either.
---
cherry-picking the good times from the past while discounting the many many quality of life improvements, the gamer way^TM
---
This is unfair! NCdock cannot lose anything if they refuse to undock. For now the war seems evenly poised.
---
i've got screenshots of a fedo
---
he's a good boi
---
You can't warp them beoyond 100km. They are not completely safe. There should be lowsec bubbles that would tackle capitals to make it less cancer.
---
Good on you that you know a few that wanna recruit. To me its just sad how bad eve became experience in the game doesnt matter any more its just how much more people can you bring. And that just a sad and bad state of the game.  Imperium did well in seeing this early but for eve as a whole the current state is bad if not terrible.
---
Ps if you think otherwise and such that all good :)
---
oplexing alone in a day one frigate is going to be super duper frustrating for you as you basically don't have a chance to fight anything alone in a 1v1. I would advise joining a corp in FW and oplex with them so that you can enjoy the game.
---
If you really want to try frigate 1v1 here is my [tormentor fit](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77104734/) it's quite strong. Replace T2 modules with meta ones if you can't use them. You can replace a web for a scram if you are worried about people leaving the fight. Load aurora or a T1 long range ammo if people go above 10km range. Otherwise, orbit à 8km and shoot multi frequency.
---
oops :D
---
Til.. shooting structures is worth reddit posting
---
I'm actually inclined to believe they care.  Had a generic vni bot show up in system that I live in, contacted dinodiplo, they came over within an hour, did testing.  Logged on 2 days later and was told it was a bot, and that it was killed and kicked from TEST. But no fanfare, just a quiet quick execution.
---
&gt; Faction BS, i actually fail to see the point of those. What are they good for when you can simply buy a pirate BS. What would that rework look like?
---
I mean, i think that perfectly describes why they need a rebalance. The navy/pirate battleship progression needs a rebalance.
---
Historical progression has been T1 -&gt; Navy -&gt; Pirate. Now its just T1 -&gt; Pirate. This is due to pirate being so easily farmed and having demand with inherently better stats.
---
Pirate battleship BPC need a drop rate nerf from DEDs. Maybe a minor LP cost increase as well. 
---
Then Navy battleships need a rebalance to be competitive in different ways or provide a niche pirate battleships dont already occupy.
---
As far as BLOPs go, the Widow has a nearly useless ECM bonus attached to the hull. The all could use some freshening up to help focus their role better. A lot has changed since they were introduced, some catching up in certain stats could be helpful.
---
You can do level 4s in a rattlesnake better than a marauder (cheaper too). They are not the go to ship for level 4 missions. Newbros aspire to fly them because "ooh shiny t2" but then realize there are better options.
---
I did this in a vaga, cleared out the whole pocket coz i didnt know i can just take the loot and leave lul

No, i do not care about your reddiquette.

Now kindly remove yourself you bot aspirant.

I'm going to have to figure out a way to incorporate "compliance titan" into my non-Eve speak.

If you make capital grinds shorter, you'll just get more seasoned players spamming capital alts.
---
Btw, capital ships aren't all fun and games. I have a lot more fun flying recon ships or logi.
---
...where have I seen this before?
---
The moldy croissant
---
I would make them immune to having their MWD shut off by Scrams. They still can't warp if Scrammed, but their MWD still works.
---
WAH WHY WONT NC FEED TO US WHEN WE HAVE 3X THEIR NUMBERS
---
Let's cut the revisionism here. They let PL invade and Provide members widot to Legacy, then moved in on the right timing to grab all the Provi forts for themselves. I believe they gave one or two away as a gesture of their benevolence to provi too as well, lol.
---
&gt; NC. are claiming they are winning the ISK war
---
Not, if you count how much can goons farm meanwhile... If you do, NC is still loosing badly.
---
Is there a good how-to or wiki for new players?
---
This is a copy / pasted message, but fell free to answer it if you have any questions.
---
First of all, take the time to do the career agent missions. It will show you many things in the game (exploration, mining, industry, hauling, etc).
---
Then, well Eve is a sandbox, so you will need to figure out what you want to do. As a new player, you are not strictly limited, but what ever you do, Eve can be dull and boring, mechanics are complex at first because of the amount of informations you need to learn but once you understand them it's generally a lot easier. What ever you want to do, try to have fun or enjoy the complex interactions mechanics are creating, so basically don't grind isk for the sake of grinding isk.
---
- Want to explore the stars alone ? Buy an exploration frigate, a cloaking device and go around the stars looking for data and relic sties. Maybe join a wormhole corp and enjoy space where frontiers change everyday, and need scanning on a daily basis. There are some newbie friendly wormhole corps that can teach you the way of Bob.
---
- Want to join one of the large nullsec empire ? Join TEST, Pandemic Horde, Karmafleet or Brave. They are all well known newbie friendly corporation/alliance and they will give you free ships, a place in fleet, and people are generally willing to teach you. They also offer good opportunities for new players to make isk (exploration and salvaging mainly).
---
- Overwhelmed by large organizations but still want to join an active PvP corp ? Try and look for a small faction warfare corp or alliance, there are plenty of them and they will also guide you, get you a place in fleet and you will enjoy endless content.
---
- Want to settle in a bit more in "security" ? Run some combat mission in HS. But try not to do that, really.
---
- Want to become the space Rockefeller ? Look into market, region trading, and all the shit. You won't blow space ships but if you enjoy raw data, data analysis (like, real data analysis) this is your thing. Isk revenue is potentially infinite.
---
- Want to mine rocks and turn them into modules, ships, ammunition ? Start mining and industry. Pro tip, don't do it alone in HS you don't have a single chance, join Goons (= Karmafleet), nullsec have way more valuable ore and Goons are basically the safest most organized industry in the game. You can also join some renter corp but that's up to you.
---
- Want to build your own corp ? Build it with some friends, maybe to do industry, or PvE, or PvP. My 5 isk : FW is a really good way to make isk and have some fight for new players. Low class WH can also be interesting.
---
A short list of advice :
---
- [This is your bible](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main_Page)
---
- Right clic EVERYTHING.
---
- Eve is a sand box, figure out what you want to have fun doing and don't bother what other thinks. There is no right way to play Eve.
---
- Faction do not matter. Pick one you feels seems cool and then ignore it for ever since you can fly any ship of any faction without any difference.
---
- Eve is also a dangerous game. Don't use ships you can't afford to loose. Both players and NPCs can wreck you quite fast, even later in the game when you will fly big expensive ships.
---
- People will kill you. No matter where you are, people can and will kill you, even in high security space. HS is actually the worst place to be, because you think everyone is friendly when it's really not the case. Outside, it's a lot more easier, everyone is your enemy.
---
- The very same people that will kill you can also be the same people that will explain to you why you died if you ask them. People in the game are generally friendly and don't mind teaching new players.
---
- Don't get attached to your ships.
---
- Eve shine when played with other people. Don't be afraid of recruitment policies, knock at the door, join a corp, have fun with others.
---
- Learn of your mistakes, don't get angry. If you died, it's your fault.
---
- r/evenewbies it's a good place to ask stupid question. r/evejobs it's a good place to look for a corp.
---
How I would do it:
---
* Give new players more to work with at the start. Make the career agents give them an opportunity to start NPC corp careers and direct them towards player corporations after completing their missions. Expand these missions and the tutorial to give them a taste of things, even big fleet PvP (have them fly their race's ranged destroyer and anchor on the fleet and follow orders delivered through game audio).
---
* Give these new player corps some amount of passive resource generation for the new players. Basically, give newbies reason to feel like they can risk their ships and learn. Right now, the majority of newbies spend an hour or two in hisec noob mode getting a piece of shit ship, lose it, realize it's an hour or two to get another fuckin corax, and quit. Either these coraxes need to be SRPed, or the new player needs to be making enough isk to get another one in, like, ten minutes. This will create a better baseline for the game and not funnel everyone to two pve career paths (explo and null afk ratting). Don't move the top up, and consider this isk source your baseline for bots (and build a few anti botting measures in).
---
* Continue to point players in the right direction for them to learn about conflict. In a way this game is like a giant, neverending Battle Royale. If we fix Faction Warfare, it's LITERALLY a giant Battle Royale with the guys taking the warzone getting that big V and a sweet medal. Show industrialists it's dangerous space from minute 1, have one of the missions in the tutorial be a courier scam (but it's the NPC losing money).
---
* Put that big ol "this is what you can do in eve" flowchart in the trailer, in the tutorial, generally present that there's a lot of stuff out there. Players who only see hisec quit very quickly.
---
* Make a couple of low to moderate cost changes to sov null so that the bulk of veterans speak positively for a while and can be reliably retained.  Plan the other changes as the income from the new players start rolling in.
---
50k concurrent in 2019 isn't easy, but it's a long way from impossible.
---
I'm not sure all the walking in stations and mobile integration ideas will actually give you \_players\_ so much as numbers to count.
---
You never thought of it?
---
It’s literally the cancer we got rid of when structures care out. Imagine repping a Keepstar from half armor even with an uncontested fleet of FAXes. That’s fun and engaging gameplay right there.
---
Now excuse me while I vomit.
---
This isn't going to help new players or up your concurrent count significantly. We need a lot of them for retention, but you're off your market goal entirely.
---
Do this while improving the new player experience and giving newbies a much higher baseline of resources and skills to start with, and you've got something.
---
It's actually mostly Java/php. It's easy to forget that Java 1.4 was released in 2002.
---
Sorry to be a jerk, but If you're mentioning Fortran/Cobol you're probably older than you think! haha
---
When you’re hunting bots you need to use a hyper ceptor on an alt to actually catch them, and you have to be very fast / lucky with your dscanning
---
Haha like a boss ! 🙏🏻
---
And a sharknado falls on the poor krabber...
---
I think goons are not farming much now.       
---
Simply Goon wallet and NC wallet is bit different.        
---
For NC losing a titan is bad thing, for goons losing 3 titans is ... meh who cares.
---
With a computer program that runs a script often controlling the mouse/keyboard
---
There being great riches unexplored and ready to be exploited is a motivation for both rl and eve explorers. If it was all about going to systems and seeing what's around you wouldn't be able to sustain that playstyle after having done a few of each cosmic signature type.
---
pretty easy.  they just monitor the data coming from the server and react accordingly.  Since it is highly repeatative, you can just program routines.  So see a neut, warp to station.  See a npc, lock up and fire.
---
Yeah, i worded it badly, i ameant it more like you wrote. Goons do not care if they lose half of deployed titans. Not like they have anything better to do with them anyway. 
---
And you can only have so much Rorq pilots injected (most people i know limit it around 6-8).
---
Very much this!
---
In fact, now that Triglavians are invading New Eden, couldn't we make current abyssal pockets into regular complexes and remove that instanced bullshit that looks ugly in our sandbox?

Hi, 
---
returning player currently looking at abysall space. It seems lot and lot of fit are about missiles (and so caldary ship). Is there good turret fit ? I've invest some time for gunnery and minmatar ship, so i prefer to stick with it if possible.
---
Lots of companies, including some of which I've worked at follow an approach in which they wrap the old code in a DO NOT TOUCH container, develop new  microservices and slowly port newer features into the new co-debase until the old code is obsolete. This is actually much cheaper than re-architecturing your software (which is gonna be obsolete in 5 years) and spending a ton on money on top.
---
Having played Eve online on and off it is kinda obvious that's the approach CCP is following. Either that, or they're still hacking 20 year old C code for new features, which would be very sad if they did.
---
Inties shouldnt be neut proof, especially to direct counters from larger ships. However, against things like small or medium neuts, the resistance would still be quite effective.
---
Where is the footage of Fleelo?
---
This is a pretty interesting thread to read :D
---
I'm glad I'm not a game designer, because my list would be savage, and probably SUPER unpopular haha
---
Thanks so much for taking the time to reply..
---
I'll look up some newbro friendly FW corp and try out the fit..
---
Are you in any such corp rn?
---
That is if they somehow were able to follow the route of the key without being able to investigate it under CC fraud.
---
He’s mentioning an old play style that was viable for making lucrative amounts of isk, and saying that play style is no longer profitable. So yes he’s talking about isk but he’s talking about a play style that he enjoys, that used to make isk, not being viable anymore.
---
Not saying that he isn’t able to make isk, just that he can’t play the way he once loved to.
---
the trick is that botters can't argue for themselves because they don't know english  
---
[oops](https://youtu.be/yvMM_Pt39oo?t=10) there i'm at it again

Fuck bots. This is what we do to them.

I'm not super up to date on how active some names I know are. You should post on r/evejobs

We were bitching about all Russians botting two years ago, now it's Chinese, in every other MMO it's Brazilians, I think we can safely say there's no need to point fingers at a map.
---
*glares angrily at Sony and Bungie*
---
But muh Vargur ...
---
Yes. Called them blue, to trigger the autistic children that can't 1d cap hard enough to 2+2.
---
tapi snatched them faction forts panfam had their eyes on then gave provi their space back. you can spin that however you want.
---
What?
---
Double longpoint Ishkur with one hyperspatial can kill a vni fairly easily. Is that cheap enough?
---
Do that.
---
Honestly.
---
It's not that hard to track where a key was being sold and where it was being redeemed. After all at both points its CCP that handles it. Maybe they don't enforce it currently, especially with all the rmt shit which is more important. But that doesn't mean its allowed nor that it won't be enforced in the future.
---
We get them with hyperspatialed interceptors off gates a lot, though they're getting faster. The frat bots have started running a different fit instead of the 100mn that aligns much faster.

Delete local outside empire space. No capitals in lowsec. Delete asset safety. Limit alliance/corp blue lists to 2 entities. Delete sov. Nerf rorqual boosts and HP by 50%. Blops now have cops cloak. Buffer cloaky T3Cs now work again. Blops and Marauders now cost half as much. Hire extra bot hunters. 100 Plex reward per confirmed bot reported. Let people change character sex/name (still list old names on the sheet). Buff incursions of Sansha, Drifter, and Triglavians to Armageddon levels, causing the empires to bring out their Iapetans from storage, and setting New Eden on fire as the target capsuleer power blocs as well in an attempt to preemptively percent a capsuleer takeover of empire space.

I wish this part was easier to do. There must be a better way than some real human who is not a security professional having to stare at this for hours on end and ultimately GUESS that they are bots not just poopsocking players. Bravo on the enforcement work either way.
---
sure was quick for the pr moves to come in. Also that's ccp job, never forget that, regardless of what you do by yourself.
---
Don't come out with retarded content like this stupid trig invasion
---
They call it "dynamic camera" and it changes according to the size of the thing you're looking at. 
---
And yeah, seconding turning that nonsense off.
---
Whilst those are valid points, you can still release it on pc and draw in many people that wouldn’t otherwise play eve. There is a chance that many of those people who would have played dust on pc, may make the change to eve itself. Especially if dust was tied to the eve client (WiS could have helped here). Also, releasing on a end of life console was the biggest mistake that was made.
---
There are.
---
It's bots
---
Indeed they are
---
I get it quite badly in Abyssal space where there's a really noticeable fish-eye effect on the camera, especially if you zoom out quite far.
---
the super sweet nuss gipfeli

By “your very own coalition” I’m assuming you mean literally everyone in EVE?

This.

I liked Dust and would probably have played the shit out of it if it were on PC. Being exclusive to PS3 though... I picked it up and played a few hours of it and went back to playing Blacklight.
---

adc is honestly the worst offender, a competent gang can force off a ceptor in the span of time it takes for the adc to active cycle alone, why even bother with ceptors at that point  (both really) unless you're hunting.

i was there in a shitfit logi praxis, PL enters grid and im INSTANTLY in my pod, about 2 minutes later grid has been reduced to 2 faxes, the moros and a few rookie ships wich keep undocking just to get instapopped

another 2~5 minutes later they start podding everyone who didnt warp off in their pod

Or just reduce the amount of ressources to spread alliances and have spread out space rather than either overcrowded or completly empty space.
---
Create 30k of Veritas' thin clients and log them in

yea that was the worst part, i kinda wish u/Quebber will realize this and pull the plex to his vault when a 140 man fleetdoctrine shows up just to steal the kill and ruin the whole thing

Delete local comes up all the time and while I agree with it I don't see it happening. So what about a compromise? Make local in null be an Ihub module that shares a slot with other upgrades. You want local? fine, no more infinite pirate sites.
---
Good to see you left the blob
---
making capital grinds shorter isn't the only option, giving brand new players way more skill points to get off the ground may be an option.
---
providing CHEAP skill point boosters from npc's or doing special arc missions for certain skill point level players could be an idea. 
---
&gt;capital ships aren't all fun and games
---
id also say capital ships aren't all dull and dreary moments either, from what you have all said they have their ups and downs and well to put it bluntly, i want to experience it, but I do not have the patience for a 2 year skill point grind just to get what, a mastery level 3 or 4 or even level 5 for one, two or three ships.
---
i understand what your saying, i bought an astero and a porpoise before i stopped subbing, but different people, different desires, different available play times, i am not asking to be able to get access to all abilities and all ships, im just asking them to afford the new players the chance to catch up more than what they are offering now, otherwise ill keep my money and wait for arma 4.
---
Its just way too late to invest that much time into this game no, 12 years ago maybe, 8 years ago maybe but nearly 20 years on, how much more life does this game have? I hope for you a long time but I have to be realistic here with my life and my personal time and if it should be spent on this game so late in the game.
---
If the playerbase is what's ruining your game then it's the devs fault for promoting that kind of behaviour. A pinky promise agreement not to bot doesn't stop botters. A pinky promise agreement not to citadel spam the everliving fuck out of every system doesn't make for healthy content. A pinky promise to not drop titans/supers on everything doesn't bring more fights.
---
What fixes all those issues is fixing the game mechanics that promote that behaviour. Just expecting people not to anchor 100 AUTZ Raitarus for the price of 1 titan because it isn't fun for the enemy isn't exactly reasonable.
---
Exactly, they were accused of harbouring bots, which according to the chart, as well as being the largest alliance in the game, doesn't seem to be true. Obviously now that they've started renting, a byproduct of that is an increased risk of botting happening in your space. However, he literally tweeted that "botting is the product of renting.", so he obviously understands that botting will occur in the rental space, which he never states isn't occurring.
---
Also, why do you always assume that anyone that disagrees with you is a goon? Are you that arrogant that you don't believe anyone can form the opinion that you might be wrong?
---
Nothing ? My corp joined shoot first like a month+ ago. I assume the alliance has grown enough outside the main TZ to start contesting timers, probably got more allies too. I still expect Snuff to blob and batphone (just like everyone else in Eve), but so is leadership I assume. Blueballs and boredom from structue bash are probably going to matter more than fighting ability tbh.
---
&gt; how do you do it?
---
Delete reddit.
---
I guess I never thought of people repping the pos during a fight, didn’t play pre citadel so only ever heard of repping poses as a way to fix jump bridges and shut. That does sound rather cancer
---
This might be great for current players and help to retain them. maybe even bring some of the older guys back. But it wont bring in new players which you need old and new coming to the game to reach this goal.
---
This... And do it every year at the end of the Iceland fanfest. Then, at the restart, you'll always have a rush of players heading out to claim new territory again. Annual chaotic content would be better than the current grey aged slug. 
---
Well, I call it a slug anyway, maybe it's just me because I've lost my ambition to fly a big fancy ship years ago due to my lack of commitment to grind like a bitch.
---
I just love that Ma5hy and h is defenders used goon botting to justify his input broadcasting and then it turns out the goon botting thing is just a meme.
---
Instructions unclear.  Slammed face into wall.  Repeatedly.

To add to this, most FC I've played with have multiple alternative ship fitting as options. They're a bad FC otherwise.

Wait really? I haven't run the math on that recently.
---

There are now two rooms with open gates at the beginning.

One is when you are far from spawn and cache, another when you are at their optimal and near to cache.

For close combat room I would suggest to have strong mindflood booster which should help you to burn down critical mass of leshaks that are neuting you.

That's... a bad fit

---
13 years ago, maybe.  With current force projection mechanics, it would just squeeze more small-timers out of null while the big boys spread out and made more space more empty.
---
Yep
---
Well it is completely safe since you can just frag a hunting HIC in no time with a super, unless for some reason you drop with a full heavy armor fleet in system you're pretty much invulnerable, especially if you use a deepsafe to enter the site, preventing you from having any natural warpins nearby.
---
Complexity is hard. Everyone knows there can only be two teams in any given contest. More than that, and it must be a clever ruse designed to conceal hidden intentions.
---
There are several different philosophies when it comes to approaching sov ownership. In its most benevolent form, the alliance seeks to merely hold and defend its space for the long-term benefit of its membership. The alliance will develop its ability to project force only insofar as it is necessary to defend its borders, and perhaps the borders of key allies, against wars of aggression. Since they are fundamentally non-aggressive, these alliances tend to have the strongest focus on fun fights in their PVP.
---
This is a tricky balance to maintain, however, since in EVE an Alliance must be well-practiced at war in order to battle effectively. It must maintain its supply lines, train its FCs, and keep its members at max hype for fleet pings. It's often difficult to maintain this kind of readiness without participating in some kind of aggression, unless, of course, you're getting farmed and steamrolled by the wrecking ball of a much more powerful alliance, which is consequently bad for morale, bad for your supply lines, and ultimately bad for your FCs. Even the enemy will bore of it, and be forced to hire mercenaries to finish the work in its place. 
---
The second philosophy is that of benevolent empire. This sov alliance maintains its territory for the benefit of its members, but its members also have a clear understanding that being part of a strong empire is not only for their benefit, but it requires their active participation and even sacrifice for the good of the empire. They are by no means averse to aggression, indeed they are constantly preparing for the next war of aggression. Due to their strength, they can pick and choose their foes. If they want to sharpen their sword on the necks of the strongest or weakest, they will. It's unlikely they will do so without some clear strategy, however, since empires rarely survive by spreading themselves too thin. Empires can, in their benevolence, deign to participate in fun fights, much like a medieval King might hand out presents to the peasantry at Christmas.
---
A third philosophy is that of the space Nazi. They pride themselves on the strength and superiority of their forces. They may or may not maintain territory for the good of their members, but their focus will be on almost constant wars of aggression against weaker foes. Sometimes empires will hire such groups, sometimes empires will kick them around to insure they still remember who is boss. Everyone else lives in fear of them. They consider fun fights to be opportunities to escalate for max frags, because the possibility of losing *any* fight is beyond their comprehension. It is assumed that any FC caught leading a fleet in such a battle would be invited to seppuku.
---
The existence of the first type of alliance almost always depends on either the protection of an empire or simply being ignored by the space Nazis. Since the space Nazis are unlikely to ignore a nice juicy target long-term, it behooves these alliances to either make friends with a strong empire or the space Nazis. Since the latter often make terrible, unreliable friends, even when they're willing to accept such an offer, the benevolent empire ends up being the much better choice. Strategic partnerships between these types of alliances are sometimes seen as necessary to create a stronger meatshield against the inevitable space Nazi doom, but those agreements tend to evaporate as the meatshield gets consumed.
---
This is everything one needs to know about how pacts are formed between alliances and coalitions in sov null.

How would it squeeze small timers out of null ? Spreading null is the only way you would be able to harass a group.
---
might as well sansha-fy them and give them bonuses to AB instead.
---
&gt;Assault frigs arent bubble immune like fleet ceptors and wouldnt be as fast as rebalanced combat inties.
---
does being faster than afs on grid really matter at this point? """tackle fit""" afs are already fast enough for the majority of targets, sure combat ceptors could be faster than them but at that point why even bother. Agility is for sure a plus but still, pales in comparisson to the advantages of afs, and if they were buffed so that it is not the case now you just have 2 ridiculously overtuned ships instead of just one.
---
imo before you can make *any* change to combat ceptors to fill that role you need to tone down afs pretty hard, there is no way around it, honestly just remove combat ceptors and/or replace them with the afs, there are already enough abandoned ship lines in the game, might as well cut the bloat.

From someone who has been out of the game for going on 2 years now, these are the type of changes that would bring me back-
---
Pockets of NPC null in every region
---
Rework citadel timers and remove tethering
---
remove regional self sufficiency
---
Nerf jump freighter range or remove JFs altogether - It's convoy time, boys 
---
New storyline direction with the empires, under constant assault from the various NPC and player factions, begin pulling back and consolidating their control. Tie it to a shift in lowsec/fac war mechanics that allows influence over security status and empire affiliation of systems. 
---
Lowsec capitals automatically spawn proportional NPC response fleet
---
Basically, encourage more player interaction to achieve player goals
---
X is percentage increase. Y is price
---
Provi Bloc are Legacy proxy.

SkillU are Panfam allies, but still independant.

There is any way to make a dump from corp wallets, or players inside every corp and see their ticking frequency?

The only true easy way to detect a bot, is seeying their online time. After that, each case would need to be investigated and would require a massive time/effort, way beyond players reach.
---
I will probably try wh life.

Got some decent starting isk in nullsex block, but i am tired of it already (even with good people in corp and ongoing war this playstyle bores me to death).

Oh god yes, BRs have a reputation for botting/cheating/scamming/begging that is only semi deserved in every other MMO I can think of.

---
Unfortunately, its true.
---
My daily income worth 2 plexes (46h/week) and its not a bad job.
---
I can easily do 1.5 plex per hour in game. This is SO sad.
---
Imperium announce they are deploying to burn everything down. 
---
So, you let them.
---
No idea how that's fucking with a deployment if you're letting them do the thing they said they were going to do entirely unopposed....
---
I think the real problem began when you could skill inkjet into them on a two day old char.
---
But, it’s what we have now so, we’re going to need to get more creative with our solutions
---
It doesn't matter... just fit them yourself.
---
Anyone can fit rigs, and if you can't use a module it will be offline and useless anyway.
---
100mil possible loot is nothing in nullsex, killmail is pride and bragging rights :)
---
Actually, what we need is Material sinks, just as isk sinks. You see, infinite resources is not a bad thing in a game like EvE that is supposed to destroy and wrecks things over and over, make you loose stuff....and money.
---
However, eve players have become really good at acquiring, farming, hoarding and generally stockpiling stuff and cash over time...which prevents the economy to work as designed.
---
You mine ores for minerals and fabricate ships+items
---
You farm planets and obtain specialized resources to fabricate space structures and a few consumables
---
You salvage wrecks and obtain another specialized resource
---
You exploit moon specialized ores and create adv technology
---
You scoop gas and create boosters
---
You kill drifters/sleepers and obtain exotic pieces of technology and create advanced ships
---
Yet the only way to detroy all the above, is by doing PvP (or in PvE by mistake against an NPC),
---
The only material thing that gets consumed over and over is ice, either for jump fuel or for fuel blocks. Even the regular learning implants and re just plug and forget....replacing them only when podded.
---
A lot of things need to be adjusted so they are consumed more often and therefore keep the isk flowing in the economy, not just sitting in someones wallet.
---
Lets not forget that panfam effectively stabbed deadco in the back because deadco paid imperium for peace with no cloaky camping on the excuse that "40 faction fortizars resulted in money for imperium that they can use against panfam", yet the majority of those ended up in a trophy case in delve. 
---
So it would be less of a blue doughnut if panfam was less shiny and bright towards their so-called allies.
---
wew, so edgy
---
Only battleships and capitals can effectively fit heavy neuts (outside of meme fit ashimmu and curse). There are still a lot of targets to tackle that wont insta-gib your cap. Also, cap batteries exist which would add on to that resistance and increase cap. Making it so a single heavy neut wouldnt cap you out but youd need to make fitting sacrifices which is an effective balancing method. Guess your fit would need go with what you intend to tackle, as it should.
---
Could work as a replacement for current instanced PVE, and give people running the sites more safety than other kind of content (maybe the gates could need some filament or any other shit like that) without removing them entirely from the sandbox.
---
I don't play anymore i'm talking from a development perspective at my day job where 95% of the issues are PEBKAC
---
what's your vaga fit for L5s?
---
Agreed, will update it for next time.
---
Really you don't even need a change in max speed, but in how fast they get to max speed. A lot of ceptors don't reach max speed except in big systems. 
---
You could do both of course. I like these ideas better than the others suggested in this thread. 
---
Also, a crazy web range bonus could be fun... or maybe different ewar for each race? There are lots of options.
---
? All of the ones I play the Chinese do the most of that. I never heard of a Brazilian not/scam/general cheat before.
---
Imagine buying anything on G2A in 2019.
---
OOF
---
I don't play enough of EVE to really make any suggestions, but I thought I might write about some of the problems that I have had, as a newer player:
---
1) **The tutorial encourages solo play.** Even the recommended actions after the tutorial (the SoE arc) is designed for solo play. This puts new players in a place where they have to reach out, or fade away; and without enquiring outside of the game, "reaching out" is difficult.  
---
2) **Players are encouraged to stay in High Sec,** which is coincidentally where the least tends to be going on. This teaches them an aversion to PvP (despite EVE being an always-on PvP game).  
---
3) **The game punishes simple mistakes,** and relies on new players making intelligent/informed choices. E.g. buying insurance, the right guns, etc. Everything in the game that provides possibilities for optimisation for veterans provides areas for "mistakes" for new players. Perhaps the worst offender is the skill system- where the first few days of training will often feel "wasted", which discourages new players to continue when they feel that their actions have been inconsequential.  
---
4) **The game encourages decision paralysis.** It provides new players with *so many* opportunities to do right/wrong, that there will always be a better one. This is great for veterans, but helps keep new players from having any confidence in their path, and can help keep players from engaging with the game at all.  
---
5) **Players aren't properly introduced to Corporations.** I know that with the current War Dec system, starter corps are almost essential, but it means that the way that the player is introduced to Corps is simply not ideal. Finding the right Corp is important, but there is no focus on it. If anything, it feels like players are kept away from them.  
---
6) **There is no player involvement beyond the game client.** EVE is a big game, but almost all activity external to the game is done through third party applications, which many newer players will not want to trust. There is no *easy* way to check up on your character, check your market orders, or plan routes using official tools. Games that want to foster a community and keep players involved *need* to provide ways for players to interact with each other outside of the game, and these ways should be endorsed by the game itself. Ideally, ways to keep track of the game (and make meaningful interactions) outside of it would also help.  
---
7) **New players rarely feel "relevant."** This is difficult to put a finger on, but it is very difficult for new players to feel like they can make a meaningful difference in almost anything. Whether that's big fleet actions, or simply mining ore. I don't know why mining ore seems to attract so many new players, but they quickly learn just how inefficient solo venture mining is, and how difficult it is to earn ISK there. Almost everything a new player does (except maybe exploration?) seems to be geared to letting new players know just how little they earn vs. players with a few months behind them. To a player looking at a new game, months feel like eons. They often put down new console games in a week, or two at most. What's the game going to look like, 2-3 months down-the-line?
---
The end result is that new players are bombarded with very little in-game to help guide them down the "right" path, and often end up leaving without ever finding their niche.
---
great input, thx !
---
Eve Battle Royale
---
The only thing constraining the amount of space super alliances claim currently is that they've got all the space they want for their income.  If you spread that same income over more space, they'll just claim more space - it's no harder to defend a bigger territory, currently.
---
Supercap proliferation and force projection mechanics mean any group can keep their main force in system X but still cross the entire universe to attack system Y in an evening.
---
So if you spread the resources out, the super powers will just claim more space, leave it empty, and migrate across it harvesting - then when anyone else attempts to claim a portion of it, they'll send that titan fleet ravening through the jumps, nuke the small timer from orbit, and move on.
---
Wouldn't be possible to use a light cyno to pull in ships that have more cynos and then just spam cynos. New logistics would be that incoming pilots have to choose the right cyno
---
That's an instance that could reasonably be called "not a bug, but a feature". I don't see any reason to remove it. Would be dope as fuck to get the wreck of some poor chap that went into that pocket before you.
---
I mentioned in my comment that things like ramjags are, based on previous comments from Suitonia, on the table to be looked at.
---
I do agree, AFs need to be reeled back in. Id also like to see ADCU time cut in half and then HACs given a 100% bonus to duration to keep them the same.

Fuck people for trying to PvP in this empire building RTS game!
---
More skins at a higher price..
---
Nah, they don't give a fuck. Even if you fix capitals you got those fucking Ansiblex gates that these fucks chained together to get across the region.
---
&gt; If you spread that same income over more space, they'll just claim more space - it's no harder to defend a bigger territory, currently.
---
... yes it is. It's mathematically is. You cannot say that.
---
&gt; Supercap proliferation and force projection mechanics mean any group can keep their main force in system X but still cross the entire universe to attack system Y in an evening.
---
Yes, except that system X can't cover 3 regions. If you have rorquals tackled 2 regions away or a super is being dreadbombed, they would need a lot more time to react to this than in a single region. Even with currently retarded jump bridges.
---
Lol @ the part telling NC pilots to join imperium, you really don’t like content do you?

So i just started playing, im 29, have a job, bought plex, now im old and a bittervet? Sorry i dont follow your logic. From buying stuff in other games i think the ingame value of plex in eve makes it worth it, and that means more plex sales for CCP right? Do you think CCP want to cater to basement dwellers without cash or people who can spend money on their game? My advice is get a job so you actually have money to use, then this wouldnt be so frustrating for you. If you have a job but dont have room for an entertainment budget i do understand though, that sucks.
---
Do it, I had like 5b after selling stuff from my nullsec time and taking a break from the game.
---
5b isn't much but it's enough to get some solid frigs/t3d/cruiser/bc for wormhole life. Plus a cloaky thing or two.
---
Joined a Corp and it's been a shitload of fun so far.
---
No problem.
---
There's no leveling system. The skillpoint system is there but after you've rounded out some basic skills you'll be pretty much like everyone else. Older players' extra skillpoints and money let them fly more expensive and larger varieties of ships, but bigger isn't better. Personally I prefer to fly frigates, the class of ship unlocked right as you start.
---
Far more important than character age is actual knowledge and experience, which anyone can pick up. As long as you stick with it and find a good place to learn, you'll be okay. Find a good corp to play with, it's a social game.
---
actually I feel bad for saying this now. I want CCP to make $$ and put it back into the overall development of the game. and skins are a good way to do it as it doesn't influence the game in a pay to win manner. that said, prices are a tad high for some. i.e. the latest in rust we trust skins. and CCPlease, why no rag rust skin? i'm off topic now.
---
Ask Olmeca, he will give you freely a 3hour lecture how awesome he is, how you can do it, and how you all can be together part of a change in the landscape of EvE.
---
Prob has something to do with the 1T killed in delve lol
---
We can agree to disagree. 1 yea to some extent depending on the belt your in. But if you position yourself right you can at least get on two. And if your mostly afk yield isnt really an issue.
---
2 yes I realize this but I didnt say you wouldnt be near your computer. Turn your volume up and you know when your under atk. Nvm the rest of our intel tools.
---
3 yes but your ore bay is large enough your dont even need compression. I actually think they should make a T2 orca with compression instead. The rorqs ore bay is so large it simply dosent need it. But as a fleet support ship I understand it. But its mot a support ship anymore. It is THE SHIP. There is literally no reason to fly any other mining hull.
---
And I actually dont think injs are the issue beyond injecting a billion alts. Its the afk ability. You can have 5 rorqs in the background running no problem with maybe checking them every 10 mins, you cant do this with any other mining ship. This is the problem with rorqs. If they werent the king of afk they wouldnt be so prevalent. If they werent the best yield they wouldnt be used over hulks for serious miners.
---
My issue with them is they are THE BEST OF THE BEST OF THE BEST.. 
---
I habe no problem with them mining something. But they shouldnt be flyining minature hulks out of their drone bay. If they want to do that make them fighters. Actually a rorq with a strip and fighters would be way more interesting to the meta than super brick tanked panic rorqs we habe now. 
---
Rorquals are ruining eve cmv.
---
&gt; I'm actually inclined to believe they care.
---
I am convinved if they also start hunting their renter territories and clean up there if they catch someone
---
Well that doesn't really transfer at all unless you consider it expected to alarm clock at 3 am on a tuesday for a video game.
---
Yep. See the Uniwiki.
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main_Page
---
Ship fittings listed there are mostly garbage but everything else is accurate.
---
I think when they rebalanced it they just made it that no resource was as crucial as Technetium was before. Otherwise I don't think they changed much
---
I mean, they aren't fighting anyway...
---
helldunk or blueballs™
---
&gt; So if you need longer then like 20 to 30 seconds to scram point him he is on a structure tethered already.
---
Which is nigh impossible. Try testing a double T2 hyperspatial-rigged, inertia stabbed interceptor and see how long it takes such ship from popping up in local to landing on a site (lets say 5 - 10 au and that would be close). It will still take a lot of time and there is plenty of time for a bot / ratter to escape.
---
Gonna spin up 25,000 accounts for us? :P
---
you may be joking because eve, but modern tractors have a form of "autopilot" where just plow an entire field 90% on their own using gps and some sensors...   
---
    
---
so yes... it may be a BOT
---
More like VNI afk farming, given that the Farmer still has to turn manually everytime he reaches the end of the field (just like you need to warp to a new Forsaken Hub every 30 minutes :P)
---
still a major nudge in the right direction rather than last year where the donut was almost total.
---
I have around 15B, which should last me for a looooong time, assuming i only keep one acc omega and rather pay for it then plex.
---
Bigger concern now is my lack of skills, currently i only have like 12M sp on my best pilot (and mostly drone skills). So, i will probably have to train at least month to be considered useable for wh life. :)
---
No, you are just a wallet warrior. Keep buying PLEX for few more years and you will be invested too deeply to ever let go. This game does not deserve paying more than the monthly subscription. Hell, no game does. In the end, this game is all about who has more money to waste on it. And since CCP is doing badly economically, they are okay with suckering up all your hard earned money. Maybe it is a self-respect issue? Who knows..
---
I've killed a boatload of non-imperium caps including supers in delve so yeah the 1 Trillion killed in delve is a bit uh spread
---
Panfam could replace their whole superfleet 2 or 3 times before wwb. I have no doubt they became richer since then. ISK is not an issue for either side this war, no matter how hard people keep screaming this on reddit.
---
&gt; When you’re hunting bots you need to use a hyper ceptor on an alt to actually catch them, and you have to be very fast / lucky with your dscanning
---
See my comment above, even in such a situation it's very very hard. The time-window for the target to escape is very big, even against such ships. A large part (though not all) of it is the fact you show up in local before you can even warp. We are talking a 15 - 30 second time window to get the fuck out safely for the target.
---
please it's nc. vassals, pandemic legion can't even lead a renter to the "start bot" button anymore
---
For an IT guy, this thread in particular is getting interesting. /u/suitonia where are you going with this?
---
&gt; no country is active in so much wars across the world 
---
As an Amerikan, I agree. Our servicemen are being sacrificed for international banking interests and it needs to end. There is only one legitimate war in our history and it was the one that freed us from Europe. 
---
America should have stayed out of both World Wars. Change MY mind...
---
There are so many juicy bits in here.
---
How will CONCORD react to being told they are not doing enough against Invasion?
---
What are the SoCT (now members of CONCORD IC) up to? We can guess why the Sansha are not invited. Why not the Blood Raiders? Is it because of the attacks on Amarr space? That first list looks like a whos-who of Upwell, but then I am sure the Serpentis will have an awkward time there.
---
Man the Gallente get in trouble for covering things up a lot...
---
I love that they give the Discourse so much attention.
---
Intaki attacks? Oh right there was a dispute over an Intaki religious leader just prior to the attacks in October...
---
I am sure an heir wandering around in an Invasion won't go poorly for anyone /s
---
Khanid is getting to put members on the Theology Council now? Sounds like the Amarrian civil war takes another step closer.
---
We have a fundamentally different view of current force projection mechanics.
---
Delete goons?
---
Yeah... catching them would be really hard :(
---
Maybe with a login trap... but it would take a lot of effort and luck.
---
No it doesn't. There is literally no discouragement to cheap catalyst gank-squads. Wait 15 minutes for the timer to expire, load into a fresh 1m isk trash-dessie, rinse, repeat.
---
Yooo this may not be 100% balanced but can we give black ops battleships d-scan immunity or covops warping? It's not like a battleship can land on grid/decloak on you and nab you 90% of the time with its base scan res and additional penalties.
---
No, but I could bring it down by a few. Let's see I could create a pvp, pve, miner, industrialist, hauler, trader, and fw alpha accounts. That brings the total down to 24,993. 😁
---
&gt; This game, you have to agree, is a testbed for various types of military and industry strategy 
---
Apple parking 40 rorqs in africa confirmed
---
&gt;Upwell structures anchor limit - Citadels only at Gates or Planets. Engineering Complexes only at planets. Refineries only at moons. One Structure per celestial.
---
Would love this. I'd even go as far to say not at gates either, just planets for citadels. Would be so nice.
---
Well sure, and i bet they can still do it 2-3 times now.        
---
Simply goons also can do it while having much bigger fleet.
---
so you want to fill small fw sites with claw fleets? because that is the instant reaction to this proposed change.
---
No, from many years ago.  Long enough that I don't remember when it was.
---
&gt; Because CCP didn't ~~actually~~ consider ~~how the~~ mechanics ~~of this invasion would interact with CONCORD or other high sec mechanics before releasing it.~~
---
yeah and i wish em fun with it because i dont care.
---
whats the issue there?
---
*points to Trig invasion channels*
---
&gt; Lets not forget that panfam effectively stabbed deadco in the back because deadco paid imperium for peace with no cloaky camping on the excuse that "40 faction fortizars resulted in money for imperium that they can use against panfam"
---
Lmao. Wow.
---
How about we rewrite that narrative to:
---
&gt; Let’s not forget that Sort Dragon effectively stabbed panfam in the back because Sort Dragon paid for entrance into the Imperium on the excuse that “40 faction fortizars was a small price to pay for Darkness. surviving”
---
Like, it wasn’t panfam that attacked Branch. It was just Horde. NC. reset Horde for a while because of it, and not the TAPI is neutral to Imperium reset either. Plus there’s no reason to bring the rest of what was GotG and is now just Darkness. and it’s renters into it.
---
Since when 'vassals' and 'influence' are synonyms?
---
Also, the ruck is 'Pink', apart from a singer with terrible styling?
---
Open the contract and right click the ship and simulate.
---
If the ship opens with the items on it then they are plugged in.
---
I’d like to see combat ceptors become the go to hunter. Make it so that you don’t appear in local until you decloak when you’re in a combat ceptor
---
and who in their right mind who want that, right?
---
By this glowybrain logic NC. and Horde have spent more of the last three years as not-friendly. Yet when an outside threat causes issues for B0T when Unspoken begged Goons to come save them it was Horde that showed up with NC. to help.
---
I love the new icons for pl/goons :D
---
Yep retri is awesome for that.
---
Also a dramiel is a option for small gang hunt 7.5 warp speed is amazing
---
'We don't always suck Goon dick, but when we do, we are not blue to them.'
---
Yeah, you'd have to do something weird like prevent lighting a cyno if you jumped recently with a timer. And even then it would make for somewhat weird gameplay of both sides just rushing the field in small cyno ships to get more in.
---
What's with Valkyrie? Is it ded?
---
So im invested too deeply in the last game i played for the money i put into it? Nah, i put down money to have fun, when i have fun im cashing in on that investment, its a pretty clean transaction. I respect my time enough to not spend it doing boring stuff so i can have some fun later, id rather use resources i earn in rl to get instant access to the fun content. How does thos come down to a self respect issue on my part? Are you projecting here?
---
&lt;3
---
Make dank login rewards for 16 days, calculate logins average for just that 16 days ... Win
---
Every other mining ship rakes at least 5 minutes to fill on ore, then you jettison and your booster tractors it in and scoops. How do you think the mass mining happened before Rorqs?
---
because grrr goons...
---
So just to be clear...
---
They aren't part of Goons.
---
Goons aren't making any money off them.
---
Grr Goons anyway.
---
Gotcha.
---
After reading these suggestions, I’m so fucking glad CCP doesn’t listen to reddit
---
I've been around a lot, there are many different groups with their own unique player culture in them. Even in null.
---
turn off:
---
camera shake,
---
Camera Bobbing
---
look at camera inertia, i prefer it right in the middle some prefer it more stiff others more smooth.
---
also remember because CCP is retarded the game looks better with post processing to low and turning off sound increase performance especially in large fights..
---
No 100% wrong have you flown a hulk? You fill it in a cycle maybe two thats 2 mins with boosts.
---
Because everyone is too scared to fight! Ships are super cheap, but everyone is scared to lose their ship and ruin their precious killboard. 
---
Shutting down Zkill would breathe more life into game than cutting back on PvE.
---
I’m actually impressed by this list (well, most of ’em anyway).
---
big if tru
---
Definitely check out the camera options. In addition to adjusting FOV, you may want to turn off things like camera bob, camera shake, and camera drift.
---
" I respect my time enough to not spend it doing boring stuff so i can  have some fun later, id rather use resources i earn in rl to get instant  access to the fun content. "  
---
"instant  access to the fun content."  
---
Yeah, that sentence screams Eve all over. Alright buddy, have pleasant dreams.
---
That's where you and I differ, then.
---
Same difference. When the Provi pet is in danger, Tapirium always defends it. So what does it make them?
---
Its entertaining to be labeled a "PanFam vassal" when we own a small chunk, have multiple citadels of varying types, and try to get Goons to fight and they don't.
---
Being blue to someone doesn't automatically make you a vassal. We're not renting shit from anyone and we don't pay for the privilege of being in null.
---
We fought for it, we own it, and we actively work to protect it.
---
Honor the 1v1 callout! Make the cry heard in all the lands. Justice must be served.
---
"Durr NC/PL evicting TEST from the lands they had just conquered was totally not underhanded betrayal at all guys."
---
if you warp to the beacon from a safespot that isn't in line with anything, yes, you're completely safe. anything that wants to tackle you has to burn to you, since warping to a fleet member on the grid from off the grid lands you on the beacon at zero, and you can't warp from the grid to anywhere else on the grid
---
That is like the epitome of "not a single fuck was given" lol
---
You heard me. All you see around Reddit is small gang folks bitching about no one to fight, but they won't even fight themselves because their kb would get messed up.
---
I am one of the parties who accused them of having bots in Delve. I hunt bots in Delve. We [got botting corps kicked](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/avofad/tnt_kicks_botting_corporation_thering_out_of/) from Delve. A great portion of supers we killed were bots. As of right now, there are VNI bots running in Delve.
---
If you read my response to his tweets, I have a lengthy explanation why Delve bots don't appear in the chart. Basically the chart doesn't mean much as many people in this thread also stated.
---
Imperium is huge. It's not a mainly botting entity. But the amount of botting going on in their space currently is comparable to entities they are accusing of botting. 
---
The chart shows alltime perma bans. Many of the alliances in there are dead. Ofc, Goons didn't have bots in Deklein times nor they had a rental program. But the point of my post is how rampant botting has become in one of their rental regions. If your bloc didn't harbor bots past 10 years, but harbors a good amount this year, it is still harboring bots. There is no point in talking about last 10 years to exonerate yourself.
---
So basically they can choose one. They either harbor bots themselves (the reason doesn't matter here, it can be profit or it can be "denial of profit to the enemy" like how they justify), or take serious action against botting in your space and then take the moral high ground and accuse your enemies of botting. That's my point in referring to Mittens' tweets.
---
&gt; you always assume that anyone that disagrees with you is a goon
---
Because 95% of the time they are. And there were multiple Goon replies simultaneously posted with your answer. It's a habit. I apologize.
---
"content"
---
Guess you were not involved in last years war and missed out on our Hakonen deployment. You also failed to take part in the battles that Asher and Reavers waged on the north before the Imperium deployed. 
---
I am wondering if you even play this goddamn game.
---
Goonswarm, confused.  Imagine that. :D
---
Give them delayed local
---
Here's my weird question...
---
With all the "Grr Goons" going on, why don't more people ally with NC/PL to put up a fight?
---
Oh right - so much better to just Grr Goons...
---
Nothing listed here will work because all of the suggestions are made by people who want the game to improve for themselves.
---
Things such as removing the skill queue which would have a massive effect on people staying would be absolutely hated by most of people still playing Eve today.
---
The other major issue with Eve is that it's more of a job then a game.
---
Make them easier to kill. Medium structures should only have 3 timers.
---
I don't care why, I just wanted to see his/her hull marks.
---
You don't escape the blob dude one way or the other you are tied to one
---
Are you ignoring the fact that fleet ceptors have tackle range bonus that combat ceptors don't? So they already deal better against short range neuts by staying out of their optimal+falloff. But okay, let's say you gonna go ram a curse to scram it at all cost, what's your 25% cap warfare resist gonna do on ship that's got the average cap of 250-300? Fuck all. You'll lose all your cap the same second that fleet ceptor would, then you are doing exactly same thing non cap-resistant ceptor would do - trying to cycle your scram and warp disruptor between neut cycles.
---
Where do you think you gonna fit your cap batteries? The only combat ceptor to have 4 mid slots is raptor and it needs that extra slot to fit an actual tank. because AAR won't work on him like it does on the malediction. To fill the role of the average ceptor your minimum mods are:  
---
1. mwd  
---
2. warp disruptor  
---
3. warp scrambler.  
---
And two combat ceptors are already failing at it (hello Claw and Crusader).  
---
&gt;Guess your fit would need go with what you intend to tackle, as it should. 
---
You rarely fit against your opponent outside the dreamlands of FW lowsec and Wormholes. If you go out somewhere roaming, you fit something that works in the current meta against the broad spectrum of targets you will potentially encounter, not against underused ships or gimmick fits. I'd rather have a guy in a Kitsune in my gang to help stilettos survive instead of some snowflake in a neut resistant ~~c~~raptor.
---
These 1am fleets this deployment is killing me. Work more important.
---
Not true - they have lost quite a bit so far.  For the most part, however, it's been uncontested losses while Goons clean up the stations and other structures that have been littered all over their space.
---
Wow, didn't knew i could simulate it. 
---
Will test it when i can login. 
---
Thank you!
---
Yes, it does matter.
---
Accurate
---
I've heard two arguments within this vein, both of which revolve around structure costs:
---
Make them easier to kill to reflect their relatively inexpensive cost
---
Or
---
Increase their cost to better match their robust nature and benefits
---
And TEST was backstabbed and evicted by PanFam from the north after the Casino War last time they teamed up. Why would they want to help PanFam ever again?
---
And yet here we are. PanFam crying on reddit as usual, "Why do the allies we backstab after we believe we dont need them anymore side with Goons? Grr Goonns Grr?"
---
So i can assume that everytime the rigs/equips are shifted to the right, they are fitted then?
---
So farms are the reason plex is so expensive.
---
Same. And the last real and exiting war was like... Ages ago. Last summer's goon invasion to the north was ok-ish, but this year's is horrible so far. Grind, grind, grind and like one good battle fir the whole duration.
---
Interesting view. I tend to separate the groups in only two types. 
---
But lets define two types of income in the game first, ***linear*** and ***non-linear***. 
---
Ratting, salvage, mining, is linear income, 1 hour pays the same as the next hour, your income is proportional to **how many hours** you put in. 
---
Nonlinear income is reactions and industry, in that you get 10-20% more back for every step you take the resources through. 
---
* Reacting moongoo to get the moongoo inputs for t2 production (like ferrogel), is one step. 
---
* Using minerals to make t1 stuff is one step. 
---
* Combining goo output (like ferrogel) and minerals and/or t1 products, to get t2 products, is one step. 
---
So if you take something through all three steps you get lets say 25% average return every cycle (as an average of all products I've done the math for). So if a member starts with 10bn and runs it through 10 cycles and we say each cycle is 14 days long, then the 10bn has become 93bn in 140 days. You can add more isk from linear income each cycle, in addition to this cumulative non-linearity. 
---
So then we can separate the nullsec groups into two types: 
---
* The alliance where members can partake in non-linear income with as little as 10M worth of salvage/goo/minerals because there's tons of public structures (and public moon fracks, even). They'll even give out free skill books, +2 learning implants and ratting ships (myrmidons) and salvage ships and t1 mining ships (barges) to get people started. 
---
* The alliance where members can not partake in non-linear income unless they have the many billions of isk needed to buy a moon/moon tower/refinery/manufacturing structure. 
---
Guess which type ends up having HUGE wealth growth for their members. Which then translates into the members getting into dreads, faxes, supers and titans and multiples of these at a fantastic speed.
---
this is exactly what I needed! thanks!
---
I felt bad about that. I signed up and was excited to help out before I realized it was in the middle of the workday. Poor timing for such a test.
---
It's fair though.  How much lost in unanchoring?  How much lost in teh structures transferred to other corps to protect the holy killboards?  
---
Also, I'll againb point out that part of the fun here on the shitposting front is the measures of victory:  the one thing fain in the OP was that one side can claim territory captured/nullified/burnt to the ground, the other side can claim the isk war.  Which is the bigger measure of victory (especially when the side claiming the isk war has manipulated things to try to hide a lot of their isk losses?)
---
Would you fight a 20 man fleet solo? It’s the same thing. 
---
You want to find fights and people to undock, either go as a small group or join a smaller Corp. 
---
They aren’t fighting anyway, well what do you expect Sherlock, when you’re outnumbered 3 to 1 in most cases what’s the point?
---
Space Switzerland
---
Most incursion runners start with T1 battleships it go directly to pirate battleships (Mach, vindi, nightmare).  The majority of  people start with a pirate hull and T2 fittings and then bling it out as they go instead of buying a hull that they need to replace completely later.
---
Making Astra 2bil instead of 1 isn't going to change the motivation to kill it. Making it one third faster will. Although to be fair, damage cap should also be reworked so it's not a hard cap but a progressive one.
---
Hell the North has been propping up Frat for the last month. Only reason Test lost that 1 Fort during last weeks 40 Citadel dropping spree was Hedliner CTA'ing PL to go south.
---
Why?
---
As much as I'd like to just throw CCP under the bus here, the reality is we just don't see all the ones they ban already.  Anything turbo obvious like ratting 23/7 that we could see with ESI, CCP already sees with their internal tools and bans.  If we could see it they could see it, and they have better tools than us.  This guy didn't make any obvious transactions between the toons, so presuming he didn't register them with the same email CCP would have no real way of knowing the difference between one guy and a pair of brothers that plays together from home even if they logged in from the same IP.  He ratted on a semi-human schedule, and his program seemed to notifiy him of messages or combat timers within a few minutes so he could make it appear like he was at his computer when messaged.
---
Honestly, if tomorrow I became god-emperor of the CCP anti bot program, I don't know that I have a better solution than what is already happening, certainly not one that would have caught this guy.  He did everything right to look as human as a bot can be, and until you introduce him to something his program can't accommodate for he's as human as anyone else.  Beyond having GMs spawn bubbles or shit that the bot isn't accounting for (which would get hella backlash as soon as one of them contributed to a kill) I don't know what else they can do beyond a complete revamp of the pve system that is too dynamic for a bot to do.
---
...or just delay local, bots can't ask for help on mumble 🙃
---
So in eve its not possible to start a char, boost skills, move to fw space, buy ships and be in the action like 30 mins after first logging in? Lol eve has a steep learning curve, but access to content is there from the start. Man some eve players think this is rocket science, its not.
---
You could form a community of like-minded pilots who fleet up in order to clean out their overview of superfluous structures. I'd call it Fire Sail or Demolition Men or some such nonsense. War is always the answer in EVE.
---
There are no aliens in Eve though
---
Letting people do the thing they want to do isn't fucking things up for them.... It's the very opposite.
---
23/7 bots get banned already, it's the players that are smart enough to bot on a human schedule that are the bulk of the untouched ones out there, and the hard ones to detect.
---
Yeah i do actually i have played the game for years
---
Just a few months ? do you think new players want to suck for a few months ? not from a skill perceptive of how they well they actually play the game but because of a artificial limitation ?  
---
Also do you think its possible that they change their mind and think "I dont want to be a miner anymore its boring, I want to PVP, I just wasted 6 weeks, screw this game i am going to play something else" ?
---
ISK should be the main constraint, not pointless time-gating it just deters new people.
---
Yeah, they are doing more and more instanced PvE, so that you can move away from that multiplayer cancer
---
That sounds incredibly boring
---
They did, it's PI.
---
I hear he's a wormholer...
---
So you’re promoting blue balls? Because that’s what’s gonna happen if people titans just get volleyed off the field.
---
You said it yourself “this means capital pilots have to be scared of getting engaged.” You know what happens when titan pilots are scared of losing their titan? They don’t undock that shit.
---
play dota can confirm
---
viva peru
---
I think you mean something is very, very right!
---
Last year I was mostly inactive due to IRL. Got in on X47 but that's about it.
---
But Mittens himself said as much.
---
Redline confirmed its still a thing yesterday.
---
So I'm not sure why you're trying to contest facts. Just because in 2% of cases it doesn't hold true doesn't mean it doesn't in the other 98%.
---
This is what we all need. I like the spaceships but it's very refreshing to spend time out of my egg.
---
How would a progressive cap work?
---
Can we please see your list Falcon. None of us are game designers either, don't let it hold you back.
---
Sure, just saying that talking about an isk war is completely stupid. Both sides are insanely rich.
---
Are you new to the internet? just ignore it
---
This, too, is an excellent analysis.
---
Interesting since they never helped provi defend, they only swooped in to take the forts after they were flipped so they could spin it as "we didn't take provi forts" lmao.
---
Overviews can be modified.
---
Danm, those will be way hard to catch
---
You could just fix your overview.
---
Well sure, but goons want to trade 2:1
---
At least your videos don't have half the crap on the screens as his videos do.  You can actually see things you need to see to learn the game.
---
Also, his youtube page looks like it was designed by a prepubescent teenager.  The music is awful on that tengu video.  Pure ear cancer.
---
Until a certain DPS, all the DPS is applied. Then only 90%, then 80%, etc. Of course making it exponentional or what ever math formula works best so that you can't nuke the whole structure but you can speed up the process if the timer is uncontested.
---
You can customize the "Overview" which is the informational "hud" that tells you distance to ship, etc. I'd get one of the community created overviews to start. After that I would find a "newbro" corp to join that caters to Alpha pilots in your time zone. If you do want to self service the learning - make sure the videos are fairly recent, within maybe the last 2-3 years.
---
Address the massive toxicity of the people who play it.
---
Build an automated queue that people can join from stations where they pick a T1 fitted frigate from a preset list, and it moves them to a 10 vs 10 arena battle when ready.  Have some smaller rewards per match, then season ratings that give things like custom skins or faction ships at the end of each month.
---
Number 7 there is why I dislike capitals so much. I believe every pilot should feel like they have some impact on the battlefield but once caps drop they simply don't. Subcap pvp is a nicer experience for everyone, including those new players who can't fly caps.
---
thanks for the info
---
what community created overview would you recommend?
---
also, do i need to buy a mining ship to mine? or can i mine with my starter ship (assuming mining ships mine faster and starter ships mine slower)
---
Make the game easier to learn.   
---
I do not mean dumb down; there are however a lot of game mechanics and features that are overly complex and there are also a lack of decent info for new players to read up or look up. Decent tutorials, an arena for learning (basic) PvP and a team of non-partisan (non-alliance affiliated) helpers for new players.   
---
PI was a good example of simplifying - its less clicky and the UI is much easier to understand.
---
Your ignorance and naiveness is so delicious.
---
Umm, what did I just watch?
---
this is correct given the gate camp config and numbers. jackdaw and ceptor = cannot escape by burning away from the gate in any direct. only hope is the vvvvvvery quick re-approach with overloaded mwd and hope to make it most the way before hyena lock, and then to jump before jackdaw lock/fire, slim but the only hope in that particular tight spot. not a gate camp one wants to run into xD
---
My overview is set properly. It was just used as an example for the sake of illustrating the problem.
---
Silly Goon.
---
This dude is a nobody, he is also amazingly salty.
---
Get yourself an assault frigate my man. Enyo is a fun and cheap ship to take out some ratting VNI's.
---
I played WoT and the Brazilians there are infamous for being a complete joke.  I don't think a single Brazilian group has ever been a consistent land (sov) holder.  But then again WoT is kinda hard to bot/cheat.
---
I work on clinic software.  "Can you add chart access restrictions?"  They've been there and are well-documented, and have been for **15 years** reeee
---
It's totally fair. I'd like to add that to the tally. But that would involve good faith by both sides. It's basically 2 regions burning right now. No different than a 2 front war.
---
think of it as you just got a new fangirl
---
In space, no one can hear you scream.
---
BRBRBRBR
---
o7 happy cake day!
---
Dunno much about WoT, World of Warships is full of bots and hackers, almost entirely American.
---
Modern tractors dont actually need a farmer in them these days, they just get dropped off and take care of shit themselves while some dude remotely monitors a bunch of them and picked when they're done.
---
That was simply used as an argument to illustrate the problem. Overview is setup beautifully, if I do say so myself.
---
Haha your arguments are shit, sorry try again, how about addressing the subject?
---
Easy.
---
 * Level the playing field. Generally, everything higher than T1 goes byebye. Exceptions are bombs, cloaks, bastion modules I think they were called and special mode ships like T2 destroyers. Those should just be rescaled to be basically even with other T1 ships. Also Ammo. Picking the right ammo is cool, getting +300% dps vs. T1 isn't.
---
Best thing about that would be that it would *decrease* the complexity devs have to manage, but relatively increase the variety of tools. We don't really fucking need anything that specializes more in logi than a logi ship with a logi fit.
---
 * just remove SP and skill requirements. Yes, all of it, yes without replacement. People are invested with ISK, their social life and that's good enough, they don't need more "oh but you have played for x months, would be shame to quit so close before you can fly xyz ship".
---
 * improve intel, i.e. remove local, change scanning (d-scan and/or regular) to something that requires a little bit of effort than hitting the d-scan "scan" button. The intel that is available is too good. People who can just run and hide because they see a frigate coming 5 jumps away don't need friends to fight with, don't need skill to overcome obstacles.
---
 * drastically increase time to warp, scale with size. If you have a big asset out there, you better have other assets to back it up.

 * talking about big stuff. big stuff needs to get maintenance. A cost-value effective fleet composition in terms of sizes should be between 3:1 to 5:1 E.g. 9-25 frigs 3-5 destroyers, 1 cruiser. A single person *owning* multiple battleships, super caps, etc. is bullshit. It's just bullshit. You should have to earn the privilege to fly the big stuff, by impressing your in game social circle.
---
 * replace scrams with some mix of energy neutralization and a special warp capacitor. Want to hold something down, drain it, want to help someone escape, boost him.
---
 * put all remaining dev time into good social features that allow you properly organize a group of ~2000 people to defend their space. Not just a damn calendar with events, proper pings, regular fleets.
---
 * remove the order limit for market orders. Let people sell what they want. If they want to trade in more than ~300 items, they will create the alts to do so if necessary.
---
Then just advertise to all people who quit. Hire a few big names to stream on twitch for a week or so, maybe, idk.
---
Meh, ive done a lot of incursions and it really depends on the group you fly with.  None of the groups I've run them with will take em if there is a Vindicator / Nightmare available.  
---
We do have to shoo the peasants away
---
There are groups who go around doing that. I believe P I R A T does that quite often.
---
A fully plated, high-grade slave Ark, doing what it does best. Teasing me.
---
Same as the fax/logistics changes. As more dps is added, each additional dps does less. An additional 1 ship to a fleet of 50 doesn’t do 0 damage, but is only 90% effective, another ship is only 85%, another 80% and so on.
---
That's a third of a tick.
---
I find myself having to tell this to new players who are feeling a bit down about the same thing. It is certainly a perception issue at the very least. 
---
I've been playing since 2006 and still mostly just fly frigates.
---
"Why does this game have such conflict averse mechanics?"
---
lmao worst part is this is actually how most goons think
---
Yeah that dude and his entire corp are garbo. Just ignore him, i wouldn't be surprised if half his followers are alts
---
Help, what am I am looking at?!
---
If you really really want to get into mining (there is much better options to start with than that) I'd recommend getting into a Venture as soon as possibile. Your starter ships is really just that: a starter ship, it won't make you a reasonable amount money in a reasonable amount of time (**especially** when you are free 2 play, as it locks you out of most bigger mining vessels). 
---
You are right about the assumtion that mining oriented ships mine faster, as they have bonuses or more lasers to them (infact it is a really significant difference!).
---
For community created overviews it really depends on the thing you want to do. I use the Bakkor Overview myself, but there is many different ones.
---
So all the explosions at :45 is the gankers getting ganked ?
---
Change the NPE - You wake up in your pod, in station. Aura guides you through move the camera left and right, up and down, shows you how skill training works. This is your first 5 minutes of game time.   
---
Next, this is your frigate. This is how you fit modules. Put on the modules FOR A FULL FIT OF T1 STUFF. Basic defense, 1MW AB, a real weapon, the ammo appropriate for the rats in your area. Explain what everything is (this is your weapon, this is your shield/armor repper, this is your afterburner. Here's where you see what they do in the fitting window. You have now spent 15 minutes in station learning how to train, and what you're training to operate.  
---
Now you get a message from Aura, npc pirates are attacking a group of npc miners in a belt spawned for the purpose. The fleet widow opens and you are show a fleet to join comprised of the last 5 or six people to join the game in your system. you join the fleet, you undock. You're warped to the belt. you get all the ship handling instruction there. You shoot the pirates with your new friends.   
---
Yay, you won, good job egger, now the recruitment channel opens and corp ad search panel opens.  
---
In half an hour to an hour you've been shown the basic mechanics, put in a fleet with strangers, and directed to corporate recruiting. Now you can talk to corps, go do the beginner missions, sisters arc, whatever, but you've already been shown the key "mechanic" of EvE, which is doing stuff with real other people.  
---
You're welcome.
---
100% uptime\* is a hell of a trick eh?
---
\* offer not valid during deployments
---
Looks like the cfc sov map from some years back.
---
There are no fair fights in Eve bro. Even outside of Eve.
---
just finished it
---
Then maybe state the "problem" better.  "There are too many structures" isn't really a problem in itself.  "Too many structures cluttering my overview" is, but one that is trivially solved.
---
Yes, the ark seems to have summoned a blackhole and absorbed all the damage, and was left standing in a circle of carnage.
---
I think it's ok if that's possible. Huge capital brawls should still happen if that's what a group wants. The point isn't to prevent large fights but rather encourage small fights to stay small more often.
---
The vision for this is that the really fun, small scale cap brawls would be less likely to turn into a one sided capital blob if it required extra effort to do so.
---
Some of my favorite fights in Eve has been small scale 30v30 fights that we're stalemated and then slowly escalated with a few capitals on both sides until the tug of war broke. I feel this change might, even slightly, make those kinds of fights become more common.
---
What's important is that many of us enjoy your videos. 
---
Keep posting them
---
 I'll 1v1 if you want =)
---
You missed a 'd' because you're retarded I think.  Unlucky.
---
Calling your mom fat isn't hate speech, is this a translation issue? It's certainly insulting.
---
Horde is shit, horde is being shitty, news at 11. 
---
Also Horde is an easy place to get youtube viewers/bots. Used to be there
---
I'm sure he won't 1v1 you.
---
Where are my sunglasses?
---
Concordokken!
---
1. How about new regions every year? These region’s jump gates and systems slowly evolve over the year. By the end of the year it opens up to all ships and structures and then a new region spawns. 
---
I think the only way to look forward is to provide both new content with the implementation of more simplified content
---
haha, it's a little bit different when you work for the company :P
---
I have pretty strong opinions on the direction of EVE and what I'd love to see, but it's not my department and I wouldn't want to create any false expectations or anything - wearing the CCP tag means your words are often taken as gospel rather than opinion.
---
That said, there's some super cool suggestions here, and quite a few that I agree with personally!
---
No thanks, it's better this way. It's more delicious when the victim does not know what's coming for them.  Please keep ''investing'' your time and money into this game. Could you also share your in-game name so I can take a look at your zkill. Got my popcorn ready.
---
If you think SP is the primary indication of skill, you clearly don't understand the game much. EVE has a crazy learning curve, shortening the skill grind will just put new players in bigger shiny killmails sooner.
---
Exactly
---
A very large sphere of red stuff followed by words.
---
I hate it when people tell newbros to fly brawly ab frigates.  The only things that will willingly engage a brawly frigate and that a brawly frigate has a hope of killing, are other brawly frigates.  And a newbro is going to find it very hard to win a stand-up tank n gank duel with an older character.
---
Newbros should fly mwd-fit brawlers like atrons  and try to catch kiters, or they should fly simple kiters like condors.
---
The NGE / CU killed SWG for so many people.   
---
Our group basically collapsed, and many servers seemed like ghost towns after the NGE.   If you oversimplify a complex game you WILL lose your core veteran player base.   Your community.  
---
Eve is mostly about communities.   Then about spreadsheets.   Then about internet spaceships.
---
All hail Mittani, pbuh, the slayer of EVE Online!
---
Give them cloak scanners!
---
I think you're right that reverting it won't solve the entire problem, but it's a good way to remove the "negative balance", if that makes sense. Having an even more streamlined New Player Experience is essential and honestly should be a big focus. Working with established player groups to make that happen (like Eve University, Red Frog, etc.) wouldn't be a bad idea, though I understand a bias is there which makes that difficult to work into. So much of the content for EVE is based on awareness, which honestly the built-in guides and tools don't really do. I'd love to see The Scope come into play there more like they used to, in terms of keeping players appraised of events throughout EVE.
---
If we are talking a whole rebalance, then as per another one of my comments in the thread, all inties should get the range bonuses. Along with slot/fitting rebalances.
---
Also, the cap battery would stack with a 30% bonus, or even 50% bonus. That being said, i dont like gimmick balances. I was merely stating that even at 50% resist, a cap battery on some fits would work.
---
We use cap battery maledictions for catching and holding carriers. Still a 3 mid ship, but holds up fine against a heavy neut and can run tank longer.
---
You cant have a neut proof ship that also has a tiny sig, high speed. Its part of countering those ships. Id rather see more holistic rebalances to the class rather than bandaid gimmicks or nerfing counters.
---
What would you do?
---
Mate... i wouldnt give him the time of day. You mentioned Hagilur low sec and had a feeling i'd had an encounter with them before. Their gameplay comprises of camping the Bei system highsec gate in Hagilur
---
Elite pvp... Not even worth your ammo during 1v1.
---
This is good for your channel long-term; dislikes and comments show the YouTube algorithm that people are engaged with your content, encouraging it to recommend your videos to more people. However, this person does appear to be attempting a personal attack on you and your channel, reporting him to Youtube may result in his channel being restricted.
---
I do understand, just poking fun. While you're perusing though there are some good points in a [less popular thread here](https://old.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bwls5h/wind_out_of_my_sails/epyjhys/) that you might find interesting.
---
A cheap garmur with 2-3 points and warp speed rigs. If they are 10mn they will probably warp too fast for you. If that's the case just set up log off traps but honestly it's too much work for a VNI.
---
Believe it or not, downvotes and bad comments actually increase your channel score. They count as "engagements" of the audience. He is actually doing you a favor.
---
Considering most of my deaths are from goons I don't think we are blue...
---
God, that would be cancer
---
I don't. I give my boss my 2 weeks and "wish him luck on his future endeavors".
---
A great place to read up on the games mechanics is the [EVE Wiki](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main_Page). It basicly has a Subpage for everything you'd want to know. I'd recommend taking it slow, get in touch with people and join a Corp that suits your interests, make sure you go out of your way sometimes and try something new once in a while or in short: find something you really enjoy and don't burn yourself out. 
---
For Youtube sources you can check out [delonewolf](https://www.youtube.com/user/delonewolf/featured) if you like. He covers a bit of everything &amp; you will be up to date regarding EVE news. Even though he mostly doesn't goes into to much detail, you'll get the general idea.
---
Ignore mining as an alpha. Straight up. Dont do it unless your semi afk 
---
Run exploration instead. Get a scanny frig and have fun.
---
Heron is probably best to start with most med slots. Which is the one your need for scanning equipment.
---
Seriously.. Dont mine as an alpha.. You dont even have access to the decent mining ships.. Venture is a gas miner and a precursor to the barges which are 1000x better but require omega. So I repeat.. Dont.. For the love your your own sanity dont mine.
---
We kill and kick VNI bots very frequently. There is just little fanfare because a 90m kill isn't worth writing home about. Now 2 super kills showing up will definitely raise some eyebrows.
---
Possibly a crazy thought.
---
Remove SP and design the game around that. We are past the point where SP is a barrier for many players, while it is an insurmountable hurdle for new players.
---
We are already constrained by time/minerals/logistics. Tweaking these requirements could bring balance back in line now that anyone can fly anything.
---
ISK becomes the main progression, as that is how you get into different ships and sustain game play. You can feel progress with grinding without *needing* to just to keep up like other MMOs.
---
It will simplify the game without reducing the meaningful complexity and skill ceiling .  Thoughts?
---
1. Wait out session change
---
2. Approach gate -&gt; MWD (w/ overheat if you feel lucky)
---
3. Jump
---
4. Quickly assess situation on the other side, i.e. if there are no ships warpout to a random celestial, make a couple of spots in warp and keep bouncing them while making more; if something jumped, decide if you have a better chance of trying to warp or burning out. If required - follow the same procedure from the top.
---
It depends on your goals. Typically EVE can be split into various activities.... Industry, (Mining, production, distribution) PVE - Missions, DED sites, etc. PVP (so many flavors) Exploration. As an alpha Pilot, you only have access to the lowest form of mining. If you like that path you may need to get Omega. If you want to mine for real $$$$ you need to get out in Null space, and its much more dangerous without a corporation to assist. On overviews, I use Z to S
---
Good point. How seriously does CCP think we should take their NPCs if they can't even pose a serious threat to a single Titan, let alone Nullsec Blocs that regularly drop a could dozen supers on each other.
---
Gotta get your macaroni art up to par first
---
Mobile app for economy/industry/science stuff. Develop the shit out of the economic/market/trading features. Corporation stock market? Eve has a lot of good and unique things going for it. Capitalize on them.
---
That's no coincidence he stopped at 1337 right?!
---
e-LEET peeveepee?!?
---
I'm not saying its right or wrong. Just trying to clarify the relationship between test and goons.
---
If you follow the sub, depending on the narrative, the relationship has been called alot of interesting names:
---
Pets, slaves, renters, Meat shields, 'valued allies(tm)', Bros, friends, frienemies, neighbours, content, blues, brotherfromanothermother.
---
All true depending on your point of view :)
---
speaking of, can you guys pencil in a tributary cap roam for next week please
---
He’s in PH. That explains a lot. Nothing but idiots and incels there.
---
this is part in part (i think thats the saying) of posting eve videos on youtube, or any video on youtube honestly, ive got some great comments on a couple of my videos from these aussie guys that i ass blasted a few times, they literally tell me all the usual BM and shade that is pretty common around these days, i'd consider this sorta BM (sadly) pretty normal, just take it on the chin lad and ignore the haters, it'll soon pass (bonus points if you kill him on an alt and post the video on youtube ;)
---
Give them an active overdrive module, you kick the button and it briefly doubles speed. Like for 10 seconds with a 60 seconds cool down.
---
The problem with buffing the fighting ability is that AF are plain better and with the bonus AF got to sig bloom, there's really no reason to fly combat ceptors.
---
They need bonus to play to ceptor strengths, speed, sig, scan res. Without becoming game breaking.
---
Neut resists is interesting obviously but really, ram jag with nos or cap injector does it better.
---
seems to be a shortage of indy now lately, a lot of items are spiking in price due to low supply (i presume component cost increased?)
---
Were you there for Jester's CSM stuff? Seagull had some REALLY cool ideas about the possibilities for Nova's tie-ins and the potential they had for cross-player universes. I'd love to see force-on-force application to affect things like invuln timers, or disabling a super, or a whole host of other things. I really do hope CCP realizes the potential for Nova and integrates it, because still to this very day no game has the level of intrigue that EVE does in its politics, yet the first thing you hear people say when they talk about it is:
---
"EVE is a fun game to read about."
---
Like, that sucks. It's damn near window shopping for players. Having Nova be the stepping stone between the rest of gaming and EVE's involvement could be key. Imagine being part of a force that helps take a station. That's awesome, you just helped your chosen group gain a better foothold in the universe, but it's not as helpful or instrumental as being in a fleet. Maybe you should become a line member. And so on.
---
I bet if they could they would, lol.
---
There are several things to change.
---
1) The default FOV is very low.  One way to change it ingame is to be in space, and hold down the right mouse button.  Move it to rotate the camera slightly, then hold down the left mouse button.  Slide the mouse up to increase the FOV, slide down to decrease.  (I'm honestly not sure of any other way to do it.)
---
2) The game defaults to having a bunch of fancy camera movement things.  This means that when your ship moves, it swings the camera around all over the place.  In Display &amp; Graphics options, under Camera Settings, deselect Camera Shake, Camera Bobbing, and Dynamic Camera Movement.
---
3) The default camera is really heavy, and holds a lot of momentum when you release the camera.  Again in Camera Settings, find the slider for Inertia.  Move it most of the way towards Stiff.
---
Yeah, only picking fights with noobs in probes, ventures and pods is my gig, am highly offended at this playstyle appropriation.
---
time to make some alphas i guess
---
Yeah thats what i thought, not able to address the issue so you want to keep it personal, and no im not gonna link my character to my reddit name, its only losses there anyway xD
---
n1 - thanks for clarifying!
---
Wonder what does tunnel like symbols at the end relate to? Thought it would make the trig logo but didnt quite look like it...
---
What is the point of having Advanced Spaceship Command unlocking Freighter ships when you have to get it to 5 to unlock &lt;corresponding nation&gt; Freighter skill?
---
 The problem with hitting the timers is it his us smaller guys way harder than anyone else. We have a hard time defending shit as it is unless we bat phone someone.
---
They need to add a cap just like poses you could only ever have x amount of poses up vs moons. This worked. Idk why they changed it. So what if the enemy has to bash out a structure thats likely in low power anyway before they can anchor their own. Nothing wrong with this. But apparently it breaks shit cuz poses were broken before right?
---
&gt;It's not that hard to track where a key was being sold and where it was being redeemed.
---
yes it is, because without a crime it's none of their business whether the guy who bought it sold it onwards or used it themselves.
---
If I bought a plex and sold it to my friend, ccp would have no way of knowing whether it changed hands or not.
---
It may suggest a fracturing of the collective and a reformation.
---
so each point is called LGA-LGB-LGD-LGG-LGD-LGE-MGO etc.? i hope you see the point
---
Received the same link from both Veles and Perun Clades. I wonder what the video means :)
---
Title being "Structure Proliferation" quite clearly denotes the topic of the post.
---
You taking line too literally and being hung up on overview settings isn't exactly something I'm going to be overly worried about. 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
even a newbro like me knows the only exploration worth doing is in wh space anyway...people explore in k space??
---
You "clarifying" the above deepens the mystery... Its like you're talking another language! Trig language... Anyways, im sure someone will be along to translate for us mere mortals.
---
join Z-S Overview chat and install the defaults.
---
As for the overview I highly recommend Rakapaskers (I think that’s how it’s spelled) you can find it by joining the in game chat channel of the same name.
---
The Z-S Overview is also a really great overview. You can find information on it [here](https://imperium.news/z-s-overview-pack/)
---
Make the upwell changes to sov, improve the npe, rebalance capitals around roles instead of numbers, remove multiboxing, reset the cluster.
---
they've been added now
---
I may take some shit over there later.  Maybe :)
---
With your version we'd just ignore the t2 titans and spam the t1 titans. At least with my version we (goons) wouldn't be able to cheese-tank like this [https://i.imgur.com/JysQOcq.png](https://i.imgur.com/JysQOcq.png) (unheated thermal btw). 
---
Boson ratting is already low income compared to a supercarrier ratter, its just that its waaaaay less effort so you can do it without going insane. 
---
What is "broken" is that goons have non-linear income and everyone else (except TEST) don't try to make it easy for their line-members to get into non-linear income. So they don't have much non-linear income. 
---
Linear income is ratting, mining and salvaging (and also wormhole farming etc). One hour pays as much as the next, you don't get paid unless you put in hours, you only get paid for the hours you bother to put in. 
---
Non-linear income is reactions and industry (and trade to some degree). If you cycle at 25%% profit margin from moongoo to t2 modules ten times you end up with over 900% of what you started with. So if you started with 10bn you end up with over 90bn. If you had 1bn you get 9bn. If you had 100M you get 900M. In ADDITION to whatever you get from linear income. 
---
18 months ago I could barely scrape together the isk for a properly fit supercarrier, when this war was declared I was up to 2 titans and 2 faxes with all the trimmings. And I've barely mined and ratted at all, maybe 30bn total combined mining and ratting. In 18 months. Its nonlinear income that has made the imperium a superpower.
---
Yeah I read through that and it was heartbreaking. I of course have my own personal NDA stories of my time on CSM X. 100% agreed with everything you said.
---
Hey! We're not all in-...idiots!
---
There is a fine line between not being able to and not wanting to. Anyway, it's your loss in any case. I have no desire to make ignorants like you see the facts. As I said, it is more fun this way.
---
Content is overrated! Come on boyzzz... Lets make the blue donut truly happen!
---
What's gonna happen is that the combat ceptor will be sitting at 0 with a scram and there will be a tristan/algos/coercer/thrasher as bait. And then the ceptor scrams/webs you on the way in, does nice T1 frig level DPS and the beam coercer is full on gank fit and unloads 450 dps into you that you cannot mitigate in any way.
---
That would be brutal in FW, fucking brutal.
---
wrote your because you wrote it, got caught on bait
---
report abuse on youtube then move on, [it's internet after all.](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/duty_calls.png)
---
Eww. Don't lump me with Panfam.
---
Those more experieneced in the ways of fw see how that could be gamed. You are right there sir!
---
What if its dscan immune just in null or wh?
---
Speak English will you.
---
\\o/ 15000 Copies, wow! Hope all the customers recieved their delivery :)
---
Well there are reasons people don't do that.
---
1. There's no real incentive to do it. Because of K-space asset safety there's not much loot from killing structures.
---
2. Convincing people to repeatedly form for structure bashing fleets is difficult, especially when there's no real reward.
---
3. The fleets formed to bash the structures down need to be rather powerful because a properly fitted citadel can dish out quite a bit of damage, and of course people may show up to actually defend the structure at any time. And forming powerful fleets repeatedly for no reward is, well, impractical to say the least.
---

His Titan char, stalk it or bait it for salt generation, he seems to be quite triggerhappy ....
---
I don't know that you can fairly say "2 regions burning."
---
One region is getting glassed.  Structures dying, sov flipped, etc.
---
In the other, low-hanging krabs are getting plucked.
---
I kinda hope he was talking about the base minerals and seeks to return to separating the ores out to different sec statuses agAin.
---
I dealt with this once on my own youtube channel, just ignore these cunts and they will go away, to be honest he's probably a grown man it's just flat out childish what he's doing and it just shows what a low caliber human being he is and that he's probably bitter that his RL sucks just as bad as his shitty videos.
---
I wish they would give them exactly what they guy proposed - d-scan immunity, as I have been thiking about that myself some time ago. It's got more potential uses, fits better (one ceptor being immune to bubbles and other one to d-scan) and they can even leave them without tackle range bonus, cause people will be freaking out like they did with combat recons.
---
I don't think I've ever seen even just a triple bulkheaded ark be successfully ganked on Zkill. 
---
Only dead ones in highsec I've seen are just idiots who fucked up with a war dec, aggression, timers, or kill rights. 
---
I've seen a few pilots go the slaves + A-type tanks, but I still just use nomads and bulkheads for my return trips.
---
To be honest man, report it to YouTube and CCP. They really don't like death threats. I feel as of that's the only way some people will listen that it's not okay.
---
lmao these are the conflicts worth writing about
---
srsly tho, welcome to the internet of ca. 1997-2005. you'd call each other a noob homo faggot and move on. no frayed feelings, thats just how it was. ignore it and move on.
---
Are you sure? Because I remember Test going up to providence every weekend to defend their major structures with our superfleet.
---
I will do it later if ARC dosn't beat me too it. I have class in an hour.
---
I agree with the POS-esque limitations, though that is currently applied to Athanors and Tataras, if I'm not mistaken.
---
Each system should have a sort of "structure capacity," perhaps based upon sec status or activity (indexes in Null).
---
I started my journey into WHs thanks to you, delivering hot torpedo sandwiches to needy wormholers. Your guides helped me stick with the game when everything was confusing as a brand new player. All sorts of memes and jokes aside, thank you for what you’ve given to the game! There are clearly a whole lot of people, myself included, who wouldn’t be playing without your work.
---
You're wrong. It's literally easier to start for a new person now than ever before.
---
We are close to 88,000 total deliveries completed! That's a lot of people we've helped make content.
---
The graph doesn’t have to specify the implant combination. Users spot a good deal (30% for 300mil) and then go back to the excel table to find the combination for 30%
---
Without touching reinforcement timers, I think the best way to do this would be to 1) add a FOB type structure that can be placed anywhere in space, then 2) restrict other structures to being 1 per planet/moon. 
---
This could be easily done by making so that small structures (currently only Cyno Beacons, Cyno jammers, and jump bridges, but FOB would be small structures too) can be anchored anywhere in space. While medium structures and up could only be anchored on planets/moons. Note that pocos would not count towards the 1 structure per planet. 
---
This gives people plenty of space to anchor structures as well as giving attacking forces the ability to set up in space that has been “blockaded” with structures.
---
Maybe now he can finally get his book published
---
Saying that, I wonder if them seeing the result of these fax changes may get CCP to look twice at applying something similar to structures.
---
Would hope so.
---
nema problema.
---
lol not in 2019 son, sorry
---
New players is the focus.
---
Downtime is now twice a week, wed and sat. Accelerate skill training time to 2x while logged in.
---
Sisi syncs every week. Restrictions on /moveme for certain ships into designated systems.
---
Rebalance capitals. Try out different common player solutions on sisi for 3 weeks at a time and gather feedback. Once capitals are in a good place, bring trig ships into line with other subcaps in power. Capitals should be an important small-quantity large-impact resource in battle with value as a goal.
---
Overhaul the accounts system. All accounts are merged into one. Let clients quickswitch characters if no timers or docked. Omega subs are the number of accelerated training queues you get and the number of clients you can simultaneously multibox. Alphas get one queue etc. Give strong incentive to do this, like shared common inventory in stationd, cross-char PI, etc. A friendly accounts system is key to new players.
---
QoL fixes like ammo hotkeys, locking jump/bridge, etc. Toggle for simplified ui elements, default on for new players. Heavy development of walking in stations.
---
Bring on anti-botting expertise and crush botting. Revamp the pve system and continually adjust for proportional effort+risk/reward.
---
Tournaments. Develop a cinematic replay tournament tool, or somehow make the content easier to understand and appreciate to someone who doesnt speak the language. 
---
Advertise like heck. Noob frigates swarming a battleship. Add a ship interior helm mode, make cinematic shots of that. Make a story-rich tutorial with propaganda from the starting faction.
---
Examine the graph structure of the new eden map. Make more connectivity where things get too remote, and this will help in bot activity reduction.
---
 I dont get what OP means.
---
Pirates kill a helpless bistandard... "hahahahahahaha get fukt kid"

What kind of role play are we missing? Drinking mead while talking in a Scottish accent?

I'm sure someone can calculate based on his distance traveled if he would have crashed the gate. I'm guessing no...
---
Yeah, true...

This; any publicity is good, even for YouTube. Hell now he’s directing his viewers onto you by interacting with your stuff. Woohoo
---
&gt; that want to actually shoot something

I think you do not understand the basic cultural difference between PvP-Players and Farms&amp;Fields-Players like you ...

Congrats!

My loss how? For using my own money to have fun? Well fun is subjective and i have had fun with eve so far. Who are you to dictate how other people see their own use of money? I would be at a loss if i did not have fun for the money i put in, but i did, and will continue to. If you think this is more fun that just shows how childish you are.
---
When I read the titel I thought you were trying to advertise a shampoo or somthing, glad it is just you encouraging others :)
---
join wormholes
---
experience Eve the way it was meant to be experienced
---
the fact that the best space in the game was made by accident is the most eve thing about eve there could ever be
---
i mean... they'll dreadbomb you, but half of the dreads won't have siege modules on them
---
Congratulations!

In FW, the taranis has very little to recommend it over the fed navy comet. There's a lot more control fits out there and since tiericide there's a lot more viable frigs with more mids and fitting space. I would eat taranis for breakfast in a firetail or a hookbill or dual web kestrel (maybe with drugs a null/neutron ranis could dps their way out of that one.)

Challenge him to single t1 cruiser combat at the sun in tama
---
They would know if your "friend" bought it in Russia and you redeem it in the US. That's how people get cheaper keys to sell on eBay/g2a. Sure it's not a crime but neither is rmt. For both you can be banned ingame and ccp simply chooses which breach of eula to prioritize.
---
I kind of like the idea of combat ceptors being intended to be "the dogfighting platform" and actually being tuned to tackle and kill other fast small tackle. Faster sub warp speed / agility, smaller mass, and bonus for weapon range/application should do the trick here (just number tweaks) without any specific role bonuses.

It's a lot of fun and my home system is .5 with a single .4 gate that leads to a nice little pocket. It's nice being able to pop out there when I want a really immersive gameplay. Cloaked, smashing dscan, that feeling of paranoia pulling up to the .5 gate home... love it.

Index is a terrible thing to tie it to. I would perfer them do it based on system size or literally anything else. 
---
If its strategic index it takes super long to go up a level. If its indy just call in the rorqs for a day. If its combat call in the vni and carriers.. Its to easy to exploit and you could get over capacity by reducing the indexes there for making it even harder to get a beach head. But if they make forwards bases for us that dont require this capacity system but only provide minor defences and services.. Something like just a clone bay. Or just a fitting service.. Maybe even just the basic upwell suite. Maybe not even docking or tether.. Idk
---
Im not expert but im 90% sure we would find an exploit with using indexes.. I hub upgrade is a maybe but again back to the owner can just remove the upgrade to get over capacity.. I think ccp can solve this issue tho idk force an unanchor timer after a day or so of being over cap.. Idk.. Theres a lot of things to consider.. 
---
I like someone elses idea of you get x per system per type so x indy stations and y defencive stations like asshouses. Where if your over theses numbers the whole systems stations lose overall ehp making them easier to bash out.

---
Off topic... I get the jist of what RNG means, and the context it gets used in, but what does it actually stand for?
---
I've often thought about a small, cheap "FOB" or "Outpost" type structure. 
---
Only thing would be their limitations and benefits. How easy would they be to kill? Too easy and that won't make any sense for deploying and storing anything of moderate value in, let alone ships. Too tough and we'll just get "FOB proliferation."
---
This is why I don't do 5 anymore. I had a nice sub 1bil gila that did 5s but this room would kill me long before I got to the gate.
---
I know a lot of people, including myself, who love the game but don't play it. Not because the learning curve is steep, the concepts are pretty simple: you have a ship, go do shit with it. Now when it comes to things like corp. management, industry, research and all that -- sure, open up Excel and start spreadsheeting but there's tons of stuff to do that doesn't involve knowing anything besides how to hold down CTRL and target lock shit.
---
Things is, every single time you head out of a space station, you know you're going to have to sit there and spend at least an hour or maybe even more just to get that **one** single thing done. Want to go do some FW scraps real quick? Jokes on you, first you have to fit up a ship, then you have to undock and fly your ship to your FW staging area, then you have to fly around and actually fucking find someone/something to shoot at. And then chances are you won't find anyone, or that you'll just get blown up by a wanton gatecamp.
---
Now I loathe to say that we need shit like WoW's "random dungeon finder" that automatically groups people up for things like incursions and such content, but we do. I *want* to head into Delve and run sansha relic sites, but I do *not* want to spend half an hour getting my covops frig first from Jita to a lowsec pre-null system, and then spend another half hour looking at intel reports, gate activity in systems, and so on. Yes, I am aware that there is a subgroup of people who actually do take enjoyment from doing things like that, spreadsheets and "adventure planning" but the majority of players, both new and old, just want play some fucking EVE Online and see shit blow up.
---
Why waste so much money and effort crafting these beautiful graphics, models and atmosphere if 90% of your game time is spent just waiting for that one skill to finish so you can... Run combat anomalies like, 7-8% more effectively than previously?
---
dscan immune pointless... someone see's someone in local they dock.

Make Cruisers / BC / BS relevant.
---
The biggest shame in all this is that Mittens is slowly reaching his end goal. Stagnating eve and so forcing people to leave and killing the game.
---
If your part of the imperium then you are part in killing the game. This is what imperium members fail to see due to the brilliant propoganda Mittens is doing. You are killing your own source of entertainment. It has happened before on the chinese servers, it's 1 big blue donut there that forced people to quit game cause it was boring.
---
It is through entities like PANFAM etc. that it has not happened before since they refuse to blue donut everyone. Skill injection has increased the speed at which Mittens can reach his goal and ensured then the entities fighting Mittens his plan can't do shit anymore.
---
He is too optimistic for middle management. His head should be hung and eyes blood shot. Great job.

Hand out a skill injector every month and rebalance capital combat to focus on anticap/antistructure combat to make subcap fleets important for holding objectives. Introduce better PvE.
---
Yes, reporting is a good idea, might even encourage further bad behaviour, resulting in even more publicity.
---
No. Provi-Bloc has only ever really been interested in Provi, and some of the surrounding low-sec areas.
---
Even if we had the firepower to do so, we wouldn't be interested in attacking Legacy sov and structures. Which is arguably why Legacy are happy to have us as neighbors. They know we don't have any reason to attack them, where almost everybody else would use Provi as staging to do so.
---

---
A time limit for getting back within "capacity" would be a necessity, across the board.
---
I like your final point about limitations for types of structures per system.
---
CCP plenty of options, I'm just afraid of what they may choose.
---
Could you please say about when you talk about? When PL invaded?
---
I don't get what just happened....Can you please explain this in detail?
---
Clearly I need to start dropping acid to get into EVE lore.
---
4 digits less
---
Well sorta, easy to kill capitals will mean people engage in subcaps aka the eve that generates the fun fights. 
---
I want a reduction of capital usage so if pilots are scared and there for not undocking that's fine.
---
When 100+ dudes shoot at a thing in high sec but its brick tanked, only Concord gets a killmail. :(

Nice vid man!, is there some where I can get that overview? Its tidy as

More like "imagine paying full price in 2019"
---
A guy in Villore lost his Astra to a gang of P I R A T Rattlesnakes, but not before he killed roughly 2 or 3 of them in previous engagements. Each Rattlesnake was worth somewhere around 1.5bil, meaning he came out ahead in the Isk war.
---
Definitely not much incentive for bashing when your ships cost more than the structure you're trying to kill.
---
Oh for sure.. I am scared of what ccp is doing.. Between rorqs, structures and just nullsec as a whole.. I dont think CCP knows what their doing.  Its worrysom.. At least with seagull she had some vision.. I have no idea what burger is up to with this invasion shit.
---
&gt;Make it hard to hold onto territory in Null, and managing a large amount of territory should require enough time and coordination to the point that renting out space to isolated groups of renters is infeasible. Allow alliances against NPC corps, and have said NPCs bean active threat to player owned space. Removing self-sustainable regions is one way to do this.
---
This a million times. And NPCs, both pirate and empire, acting and reacting in the universe generally, in ways that give players something to work work with and against and actual rewards and punishments for doing so.
---
So far.
---
*Yawn*
---
Oh my god!
---
that's pretty fucked up... sounds like someone wants to keep r/eve invisible
---
&gt;Plus there’s no reason to bring the rest of what was GotG and is now just Darkness. and it’s renters into it.
---
Well, there's one reason to bring them into panfam, because then they don't fight panfam. Panfam is so busy "being elite" and only accepting "elites" that they're just cutting their cake smaller and smaller because no other bits of the cake measure up to their standard.
---
The problem is ccp tang that bell. It’s to cheap mineral wise for capitals. It used to take months for a corp/alliance to mine up for a Titan. Now there are fleets full of titans.
---
Oh good battle witch BS guy don't bother with him just ignore him
---
Like in GTA. Go play billiard, darts, get drunk. Strip Joint. Give those dancers something to do. 
---
Let those toons have sex with each other. 
---
Oh the possibilities.
---
Other thing is, unless you told him, he did not know how much you carry and could suspect more. ;) But most people, at least in null, do not hunt for loot, they could earn much more during that time by ratting or krabbing. But if you have a neutral in the system, it is not safe, for all he knew you could be bait with cyno and a fleet waiting to drop on anything juicy you find, so it is better to keep you distracted by chatting, etc. :)
---
I am using the Z-S overview, same name as the in-game channel where you can get it.
---
Basically the same thing lol
---
\+1 to this pile : Your videos directly helped cause me to join EVE.
---
That too lol
---
Yes.  Though, as the other comment mentioned - it really doesn't matter.  If rigs aren't fitted, you can just fit them. They don't require skills to fit anymore, just to reduce penalties.
---
Add "EVE Offline", the arcade that is avaliable in the Fanfest hall, as a game you can play docked :)
---
Put scoreboards.
---
So what I am gathering from the comments in this thread, this map is pretty incorrect. (Idk I havent played EVE in 2+ years)
---
Random Number Generator
---
This. If he doesn't have the balls to face you 1v1 on stream after shit-talking you like that, he and his group should be run out of the game.
---
Scrub. Get a 4th monitor
---
You broke rule #1 of the internet. Dont feed the trolls. Just block and move on.
---
It's more like, an afterburner
---
In a 1v1 sure, but a Taranis at the end of the day is a fast warping interceptor that is designed to act as tackle. It brings a bit more than the Ares, in exchange for not being nullified and not having the point range bonus. I find a hard time finding uses for them outside of wolfpacks, though.
---
Bathe in their tears, enjoy their raging.
---
Given that Wargaming games are almost entirely server-side, you're going to have to show some damn good evidence that they're hacking. Bots I can see, people like to skip the grind, but honestly outside of load-and-idle/full speed bots, it's hard to tell a bot from a bad player in that game.
---
We should form a small fleet! I'm in!
---
I just started playing a few days ago. It's really worth it to just jump in and start.
---
He could use a "calm down miner".

That's not even remotely true. Autosteer still requires the operator to turn/operate hydraulics

Love your videos btw, zkill guide to redeemers when???? :)

It will look great on your moms fridge :)
---
We miss your videos!!!
---
That's gonna be hard to implement for a fringe benefit. I liked to idea from someone else here of showing up on local only upon loss of gate cloak. It gives you that extra 10 seconds to make the most out of your really fast warp speed. Maybe even add a bonus that boosts warp speed for each level of interceptor skill.
---
Make it so a t2 hyper rigged inty 5 combat ceptor is the fastest warping ship in the game, like 1-2 AU/s faster then a full travel fit dramiel. Would make them fabulous at racing around for pings.
---
Yeah, he's a lil Bitch, and not so good. He never managed to kill me when i was fucking around tribute (i'm not even good as a PvPer) :P
---
Well, his entire alliance is being evicted from their home :P
---
Honestly i still dislike the whole idea of abyssal space in general, as well it creates way to much of a single player content meaning it's pilots in space that don't add to the eco system other then by the loot they bring back, the pvp makes me worry because honestly it's likely the future of small gang and it makes me doubt more and more if the eve I love is even still in there.
---
I'll get my battle rifles.

Plot twist.  Goons and Pl are secretly blue to each other.
---
Too many dislikes will make youtube not recommend your videos
---
Halloween hack has been live since 2018, and using a request exploit lets you invoke consumables your ship isn't supposed to use. It was probably due to sloppy coding to make all the weird abilities of the halloween/space/whatever events work without idunno, breaking CVs or something.
---
As for bots, no, it's still very easy to tell who's a bot. Bots react to more than bad players do, or react to nothing, but never react CORRECTLY. Players react inconsistently.
---
Because it’s really just gons and panfam left. Would you leave the “winning” side to get blobbed by the bee? You clearly would not and neither would I.
---
Well, it's not single player if the pilots are flying together and they are fighting other pilots.
---
I don't see how an option for those kind of fights could remove from the sandbox, the effect Abyssal space has on the economy is very much a chaos element people should enjoy.
---
Everything costs 100 isk on sisi tho
---
Spectre Fleet does a lot of NPSI, they might do covops sometimes.
---
Honestly yes. At least then there would be people in FW space.
---
How good/bad is the loot found in sleeper data/relic sites? Is it worth doing them or should I simply do them as combat sites and ignore the cans?
---
&gt;Currently, the majority of fully autonomous tractors navigate using lasers that bounce signals off several mobile transponders located around the field. These lasers are accompanied with 150 MHz radios to deal with line-of-sight issues.[11] Instead of drivers, the tractors have controllers. Controllers are people that supervise the tractors without being inside them. These controllers can supervise multiple tractors on multiple fields from one location.
---
Farms around here started using them a while back.
---
They brought:

Typhoon
---
Hurricane x4

Best bet is to simply ignore him. Youtube Drama rarely ends well for anyone.
---
In your YT comments section hide comments from the users being dicks. Its a simple click. They will see their comments but no one else will. Basically shadow bans them from your channel. Its a wonderful feature.
---
Dont worry about dislikes they havent really been a part of the algorithm in a while. They basically mean nothing other than simply making you feel bad. Nice thing about it though is it does show engagement which sort of helps you depending on the number.
---
Finally if you do YT long enough you will have a group of people that will dislike your video every day no matter what cause they dont like you and have nothing better to do with their time. 
---
Best bet, ignore and move on.
---
Congrats. In a way, my evolution as a pilot began with being fascinated by your book. Well, videos too. Though later I realized how much of a noob you might be from time to time in those videos, you're a top notch entertainer and educator, which I respect and will always appreciate o7
---
New pilots reading this, give this book a try if flying cloaky &amp; stealthy sounds appealing to you!
---
co-op game i guess, the options would move well a lot of more small gang frig pilots into abyssal space as well finding fights is easier there meaning the once's that don't well have an eve harder time finding fights leading them to move into abyssal space as well eating away at the limited pool of small gang pvpers. 
---
I see the end game where you can setup a fight of X size in X hull in any abyssal at that point getting well any fight outside of abyssals is gonna be massively rare ( outside of ganks ).
---
When you're treating a patient, the first step is to stop the bleeding.  You can worry about feeding them a healthier diet in a minute.
---
None of what he listed is exclusive with NPE efforts, etc, either.  By all means continue to work on it, but there has to be a healthy mid/end game for them to join or you're just on a user treadmill.  Also, the idea that injectors to caps is a new player concern is honestly part of the problem.  New players are not injecting at all, and certainly aren't injecting caps, not on anywhere near the scale that established vets use them to make alts that put them even further ahead of newbies.  Skill injectors are Malcanis' Law incarnate.
---
They understand that gons are the most powerful entity in the game so they are forced to allow them to burn tribute. They have taken this very much in stride if you ask me. NC. is fighting against the strongest empire in Eve history and the fact that they are even capable of sometimes dealing  punches is astounding.
---
Ehhhhh I’ve found FW to take too long. You get jumped on like every other minute and you gotta be on your guard :/
---
Which type of body armor would you wear when meeting with other CSM members from Imperium
---
[We’re not happy until, you know...](https://imgur.com/pvChz68).
---
Sounds about right.
---
Your alliance is shit if you have FC yelling at you for not flying a specific ship. Leave and join a better alliance. Keep hopping til you find a place to call home.
---
Yeah, I usually go Tristan; occasionally Incursus or Atron
---
There is no such thing as bad publicity.
---
The amount of views and dislikes you'll get will get your videos suggested to more people and make you appear higher in searches.
---
As expected of the CHIEF DIPLO.
---
Since you can build citadels in citadels, and capitals in citadels, the only thing you can do is restrict sov to keep from building supers. Since the smallest building citadel can fit into a blockade runner, you arent going to stop cap,building without some extra coding.
---
Well, we were doing this in Tama lol
---
Yes it did
---
some idea  
---
Make the game really free, no more plex, remove skill injector sell SP directly from the market for XX € capital can't get inject (Skill inject really ruin the game right now they ruin the plex cost they make rorqual online and capital prolifération a thing...)  
---
sell ship skins maybe new model some outfit, no P2W like faction ammo or unique OP ship just some cosmetic shit and P2Accelerate  
---
for new player and low SP character  
---
 reintroduce the "dailly SP quest" you tried some year ago i really enjoyed doing them and you just removed them because bittervet can't do them with all their alts or just make the T1 skill faster than T2 and capital skill waiting 1month to play the ship you want there nothing more frustrating for a newplayer   
---
for Pvper  
---
redo the factionnal warfare, can only place a structure if you are in a faction if your faction don't control the system all your structure become lowpower and all module offline, you can't dock, introduce a "frontline" in factionnal can only plex here = centralize the pvp = more content  
---
when you destroy a ship everything drop make the pvper farm with pvp (remove the insurance to prevent fraud and lower the mineral cost of ship then)   
---
create a new class of inty "black ops interceptor" don't appear in Dscan don't show in local when they pass a gate/wormhole for 30s (so you never appear in local as long you take a gate) can't cyno, can't fit any cloak  
---
create a "black ops bowhead" instead of creating new structure or use a pos to do covert op behind the line just use this beast, don't appear on Dscan, have a clone bay &lt;3
---
Plot armor. I'm part of the plot in which they want me to represent all their enemies as the crazy conspiracy theorist I am.
---
How 2 get kited

"Gibe mony plos" does that sound familiar? :D

If it is, it will be to memefy my candidacy. So I don't think there is any good will/endorsement there. But inb4 50 leftover Goon votes get me elected.

---
As a YouTuber, if you value your channel and your videos, there is no need to escalate the situation. There will always be one person who writes a negative comment.  You could have deleted it or just ignored it, but you gave the troll a spotlight.
---
I suggest letting it go and move on.
---
I would drop the shit out of them, nobody said grinding structures is pvp ....
---
What potential solutions you see, to issues you will report to CCP.         
---
Do you think that EVE map should be shuffled a bit. Regions moved around and some connections created or removed.         
---
What is your opinion about NPC area in each region if not what about NPC area in drone lands.        
---
Should eve have maximum account numbers that player can have?           
---
Due to extractor/injector we have situations when people can upkeep dozens of accounts affecting negatively whole community.    
---
(aka inflating plex prices and removing 'plex players' issue is escalated by constantly growing skill farms)
---
My stance on cloaky camping is in my forum post/ google doc.
---
"'Hate Speech"
---
Did you listen to TiS yesterday? Pretty much every Panfam FC said out loud, "from the start we've know there is no way we are winning this war"
---
Downvoted
---
I can respect that perspective. But at the same time, there should be a limit on how many times someone can get away with talking to others like that in our community.  As much as the complacent masses will argue against this, EVE shouldn't be an "safe space" for socially inept assholes. 
---
We police our space why not police our culture? Sure, we need to remain dynamic while using empathy, compassion and discretion when dealing with people like this; but it shouldn't just be acceptable behavior. We should stop enabling people like this by telling victims of this hostility that their sensitivity to unacceptable conduct is whats wrong.
---
To be fair, the amount of escalations and big fights surged after they changed the fatigue last year. The issue just becomes the caps drop on everything plague.
---
I wouldn't bother. Probably it is some bitch who needs attention.
---
Outsider solo player here. I've had a lot of redditors suggest teaming up with them for a good entry level corp. Could you explain why your opinion is the opposite?
---
CCP gives you carte blanche to change 3 things in the game unilaterally, tomorrow, will full support from the CCP devs, marketing, design, etc. What do you change and why?
---
Follow up - given your ideal changes above, what do you hope to feasibly accomplish, advocate for, or protect?
---
Like and subscribe. Let's hope we can harvest more salt there.
---
Ignore the cans.
---
They’ll have to remake the game from scratch using a new engine. I’m down for it, though.
---
I know people would spill their tea about losing a decade of hoarding ~~progress~~ or whatever, but this crowfall-style seasonal empire war mechanic really is the best idea. Reduced timescale means newbies can potentially fly endgame ships within a year, people are less risk-averse because nothing is permanent, and everyone can experience the gameplay of starting from ventures and frigates and having to actually build their way up.
---
my Q, is what do you feel about rorqs ? 
---
As a miner l want CCP to leave them as they am lm part of the 1% that enjoys mining and getting rich from it
---
How would you feel if a change to cloaky camping was proposed, that allowed the same style of Gameplay but you at least have to do X action at your computer every several hours or be uncloaked? Possibly a 2-6m3 fuel bay of some sort only for ships that can use Cov Ops, requiring a new type of fuel that weighed 1m3,with maybe even giving officer cloaks a bonus and make them desired for ships other than blops. 
---
I am fine with cloaky camping, just logging in before I goto work and imagining the poor carebear while I spend eight hours being paid IRL(and in game cuz similar effect right) is getting ridiculous lol. Thanks for you awesome video and I fully support your position of knocking over the sandcastle, I look forward to your response.
---
Seconded
---
Easy yes vote. 
---
The video you made shows an intimate knowledge of game mechanics, the willingness to analyze and brainstorm, and the commitment to take gameplay to the next level. 
---
Some in this thread are spewing salt. That also makes me wanna vote for you more. 
---
A+
---
Would you advocate for adding a lowsec gate to stain?
---
I've literally never seen anything like that across thousands of games in Wargaming platforms, nor have I ever heard anything like that mentioned on the warships subreddit which I read regularly until very recently.
---
1. That's a huge question for me because I have a lot of proposals. My proposals include anomaly respawn rework, mobile cyno inhibation rework, further balance of capital ships, specific ideas to help wormholes, new C7 (or shattered) wormhole systems with extremely massive nullsec statics, a mobile structure that reverts the asset safety income to the destroyer of a citadel (instead of NPCs), a new local delayed ship class, and more. You should really see the [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_pSzzvWytG2142bx7O8WKGA84TcOiAoSwIPGlbGzN6g/edit) for details on many of these.

2. Yes. But there needs to be really principled reasons and everyone needs to be consulted before making changes on the map. 
---
3. I have it directly in my CSM bid.
---
4. No. I understand people's frustrations about multiboxing and multiaccounting. I think they emerge mainly from multiaccount moneymaking issues. Also it might be frustrating to die in PvP to a few accounts whose user is the same. Then again, I think multiboxing is one of the small areas in which an Eve player can become a "progamer". Compared to other games, Eve ship controls and combat mechanics are not too demanding. To be fully fair and honest, is extremely simple to control one ship in Eve, compared to controlling a character in another MMO. Having the knowledge (e.g. transversal, slingshotting, fittings, modules etc.) is more importat than the application of that knowledge. But when you control 7 ships at once, that's where your skills can truly shine and you can be impressive. That's why I started multiboxing, and why some people appreciate my videos. So I don't see multiboxing as negative as some others. It is also the game's reality now and if multiboxed accounts are gone we'll end up with a huge reduction in online counts. CCP wouldn't want that and tbh we would give them a hard time for that as well.

Thanks evil goon fren!
---
Also a good choice.  My point is mainly that newbros should be flying things that, by their nature, don't have to win a fairly even dps battle in order to get a kill.  Other examples of good ideas for newbros include td rifters/slashers/hookbills and really anything that has a decent chance of surprising an opponent that was willing to engage based on flawed assumption (such as dual-tank breachers and rifters, dual-web kestrels, etc...).
---
Can confirm
---
Thanks for the support o7
---
I see you are also very modest.
---
was a nice chat!
---
For some, I'm sure that's the case.
---
But for others, it's the opportunity to play with fewer restrictions. 
---
How is that a  bad thing?
---

---
Escalations and big fights surging is not necessarily a sign of positive changes.  The largest fights in eve history have all occurred after the beginning of the decline in PCU numbers.  Meanwhile, the number of smaller fights (which, in aggregage, involve far more players, and which are indisputably more engaging for most people involved in them) has decreased.

My camera settings. Pretty close to the old setting. Contrary to the standard settings this doesn´t make me feel nauseous. Eve on standard settings and minecraft with view bobbing on are the only games i ever played to make me feel nauseous.
---
Yo wtf why u killing Wally?
---
I think if the greater ecosystem issues are solved, Rorqual issues will be solved with them. The ships themselves are fine. You can even say the yield is too low for the investment.
---
The way how certain regions are ultra safe, and how most Rorquals are moved in these regions now, and how people use only 3% of mining income converts to mining killmails needs to be looked at. Solutions to these issues are in my CSM bid. I don't want Rorquals to be non-viable. I want more people to use them, viably making money off them, but more Rorquals dying in a fire. I actually argue against CCP's constant yield or ISK/hr reduction as a response to overfarming in nullsec. The adequate response is not decreasing reward, but increasing risk.
---
my setting are 'default' have 16 GBs of ram , so should I change the settings, and to what , 2, 4, 8, 16 ?
---
thanks
---
It does matter if you deal with firesale contracts.
---
Obvious bait question:  Which priorities do you think CCP should be focusing on prior to focusing on a rework of faction warfare, and why do you think focusing on them prior to faction warfare is a good idea?
---
It (like most other new player friendly corps) is a big processing facility where new players get funneled in and put into PvP ships to get more bodies in fleet. At least, that's my view.
---
TIL that Horde live in Tribute

Damn you're retarded

Do you think your high alt account margin playstyle is something that should be advertised to new players ?
---
What easy changes would you propose to CCP to fix LS /FW ? What guideline would you give for long term, more complex rework ?
---
1H sword + shield vs 1H axe + shield ?
---
What do you think of the past 2 years CSM achievements ? What would you continue and what should have been done in your opinion ?
---
Wow, a Pandemic Horde member with mom jokes. I'm surprised considering this is the bulk of their local smack, so you take a guess \*wink\* at the average age and maturity limits in Horde.  They take anybody.  
---
I guess Pandemic Horde is the pubbie null sec alliance that is maybe a feeder for the husk that is Pandemic Legion. Seems to be going well. As such, they get a lot of alpha clone teenagers who just logged off from calling their fellow Call of Duty players the same thing before hopping onto Eve. Basically just being a tosser. Just do your research on youtube's TOS and report them to youtube.
---
How will you defend yourself from accusations/falsifications of NDA breach by the GSM when they find your input to CCP being received well?
---
It's not as if we *never* drop on Legacy things in the Catch area around us. Every now and then somebody gets bored and goes hunting out there.
---
But most days there's no need for that. We've got people coming into Provi looking for PVP all the time, so going outside Provi to find targets is just kind of redundant. - Like forcing your way through a crowd of eager fast food delivery people outside your door, just so you can go to the McDonalds drive-thru.
---
How would you feel about increasing the number of WHs spawned in Nullsec?
---
I already plan to vote for you but I'm curious
---
imo the big thing here is to shift a lot more of the power (and even value) of the rorq from its drones into its link bonuses, and to dramatically buff exhumers thereby. they've taken some steps towards this, but it could do a lot to make single rorqs necessary, make multiboxing them less viable, without hurting account numbers.  
---
in fact i think exhumers need a look at in general

This is the only possible supercarrier solo content

Hi flower fallen.

No alliance is above having idiot members who run their mouths, stupidly like this. I wish I could say I'm surprised, but I'm not, given anyone who isn't blacklisted is guaranteed entry into PH.
---
Please know, members like this aren't representative  of the culture in PH. I suggest you contact an alliance diplo and report their behaviour. As I will be doing the same internally on your behalf. Attacks such as this are unacceptable.

Please don't let this stand in the way of making great content, for yourself and the greater EVE community.

sure if you are dealing with bots making the fastest possible calls all within the same distance from the server on the same isp. given network variability and human error, I still believe the re-approach was by far the most likely method of escape to succeed, even though the odds were not in  his favor xD
---
How much tin foil do you consume on an average day?
---
I have 4 changes that I can't really reduce to 3.
---
1) [Adaptive anomaly respawns](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/9xxc8s/adaptive_anomaly_respawns_an_idea_that_would_fix/): This basically makes respawns in one null system a factor of how much farm is being done in the entire nullsec. If implemented nicely, this would limit the amount of farm an alliance can provide under a single supercap umbrella, yet leave room for small entities to carve in nullsec (and even give motivation to large alliances to let small alliances be).
---
2) [Asset safety rework](http://prntscr.com/nxkrm9): A mobile structure which reverts the 15% asset safety tax NPCs collect to the killer corporation of a citadel. Doesn't change anything at all for the citadel owners. But adds a brand new motivation to attack assets in non-wormhole space. 
---
3) **[Mobile cyno inhibation rework:](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/amgj7y/capital_projectioncynojump_drive_balance_three/)** A range buff to the current inhibs (so defenders really have to warp in on inhibbed friendly capitals, rather than cyno in), combined with an active single target module for black ops battleships that shuts down active cynoes. It would provide a more tangible way to circumvent supercap umbrellas (the counters right now are having a bigger capital force, or picking off low hanging fruits via afk camping), which the game direly needs atm.
---
4) [New Wormholes with Massive NS Statics:](http://prntscr.com/nxktn5) Either nullsec statics for C6s, or completely new wormhole systems with nullsec statics with 25m mass. This would support multiple dreads in and out. The aim here is to increase wormholer/nullseccer interaction in an Eve which the active population is dwindling. Capital proliferation greatly reduced the relative force wormholers can project into nullsec (the old fleets you used to take into nullsec from wormholes are less effective now due to more capitals). The mass buff would increase it to balance things, allowing wormholers to bring in capitals to null and risk them.
---
Follow up: All of these proposals are to catalyze explosions and player interaction. Most of them would make the space that is supposed to be dangerous in Eve a little bit less safe. Currently [below 5% of all nullsec farm converts to explosions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1goutrhQADKczT9MLzA47Crdf3JwsVu5PNDHKN_qIvTs/edit#gid=391531178). In an ideal Eve, that ratio should average about 15%.
---
This is what rorqs were when they first came out and basically nobody used them
---
I probably should have elaborated more, he was explaining to a viewer like 5 minutes before this how you could escape some gate camps, in regards to this one he just took the loss.. Plus it was pretty funny timing.
---
you hit the nail on the head, &lt;3 lm not even in that 3% l use plex to fund pvp and l horde all the ore l mine ;)
---
If you am on the goons list you have my VOTE
---
just get in man! aint gonna be an easy learning curve at the start but possibly best game ever
---
I did a short (2:30) [guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKKnUwOBCOs) on how to catch them by seeding cloaky sabres in the system and catching them off their PoS/Citadel. Bring this + another cheap DPS ship (literally a T1 destroyer works) and you can snag a few kills.
---
if u put tha milk in tha cereal is it a broth or a sauce
---
Sorry for not feeding.
---
I think its an ingenious mechanic but one which should be kept in the game currently, until many issues are fixed. Below is a long answer to someone else who has asked me the same question.
---
--------------
---
We recognize afk camping is not a mechanic of ingenuity. We actually enjoy active hunting more. But the way we see it, it’s the only response to heavily fortified supercap umbrella regions at the moment. So the argument is not that afk camping is an awesome mechanic that deserves to be in the game, but given other mechanics that interact with it, it’d be (really) bad to remove it from the game right now.
---
Right now if you tackle a ratting titan, a supercap, a Rorqual in these regions, all these people need to do to survive is to not be afk and light a cyno before they get cyno inhibited in 60 seconds. And then the umbrella comes and saves them. Most people are nonafk enough to do that. And the only conventional mechanic to beat that is having a bigger capital force. This makes some regions immune to such attacks by definition, as they have the biggest umbrellas. The bigger it is, the safer your space is. So this created ultra safe regions which made people flock in them. The more people flocked in, the safer they become, the more assets they acquire, for even more safety. This creates an infruitful loop. It’s not even only a matter of asymmetric warfare or whaling. By creating huge groups that can exponentially grow in wealth by depending one another, you create a sov null scene in which one side has twice or more amount of titans, and the capability to replace them three times faster. And these people have no reason to split their entities. All of which causes nobody being able to contest that force, which means no “real” gigantic nullsec wars, overall a stale game where people have tons of assets but aren’t using them. So whaling and non-timered mechanics actually directly determine sov null warfare scene, I’d say even more so than citadel mechanics etc.
---
So what do we do in Delve? We afk camp in these systems. [REDACTED OPSEC]. We can’t do any of that if it wasn’t for afk camping. If we actively hunted we’d lose 1) the ability to [REDACTED OPSEC]. The locals have the ability to fatigue-freely go from their staging to any system in 3-4 jumps using the ansiblex infrastructure, and the ability to jump to cyno beacons. So even losing the surprise element would mean we can’t get any more kills, meaning more safety for these regions.
---
I base my CSM bid on arguments which would empower the attacking side at least a bit. That means some kind of nerf to local, some mechanic that lets us shut down active cynoes, a range buff to current inhibitors which would disallow people from interfering to grid without having to warp in, or more anom rework that’d force people to split their umbrellas a bit. Between Mar5hy and me we have about 250 camper accounts. In an ideal world where these becomes true to a sufficient degree, we wouldn’t be offended at all if CCP took camping from us, trashing all that SP and accounts. 
---
The trend in nullsec is that people lose less and less of their farm in daily PvP in form of lost PvE ships. It is 5% and below for mining atm (and lower in umbrella regions: http://prntscr.com/nvjhfn ). I don’t see why CCP shouldn’t design a game where this ratio averages about 15%s, yet buff the nullsec income so the locals are actually not in a loss in terms of income. CCPs typical response to overfarming due to safety has been decreasing ISK/hr or yield in nullsec. Where I think it should have been increasing the risk. That’d just mean more people subbing and playing the offensive playstyles. Each PvE capital killed is a reason to play for fleets of hundreds of people at times. And the very people who farm in these Rorquals can go other regions kill other people’s Rorquals for fun. So it is hard to understand why last 4 years of changes made it so safe for them,
---
So, I've been working on decoding this for a while, and here's what I've come up with:
---
First, i ran the audio through audacity looking for common troughs and furrows to see if i could rig the narrow band frequencies to try and [find](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z92qB.png) any common dips/bumps that might indicate an encoded message in the waveform. 
---
Running it through a fourier algorythm i got this hex string:
---
1245ACBBBEF14FFFF
---
Then i did a decomposition of the imaging using vector dynamic composite refactoring and pulled several interesting tidbits. You can find those on my patreon. Running though through a base 16 digital rematrix binary refactor, i was able to pull another hex string: 1245ACBBEFFEEE897347
---
With the first 6 characters being the same, i knew i was on to something. The odds of this being identical across both data sheets was 14,000,605 to 1. There was no way it was a coincidence.
---
Taking both hex strings, and using a new, custom compiler( that i wrote myself ), i ran the strings through a concurrent flux AI decribber ( with prime base pairs ). 
---
It's output, however, is a mystery to me, i still can't figure out what it means. It output one single ascii string:
---
XENURIAISGAY
---
I like this, I like this a lot. This needs to balance out though, as this could be abused in many ways.
---
Fleet fights would be different if the attacker could resupply ships in system / 1 system over, instead of having to travel 20 jumps to reship (or get podded / self-destruct) and then 20 jumps back to join the fight gives both parties the change to continue fighting
---
It's not fun forming for a fleet, traveling x jumps, maneuver to the right spot, waiting for the other party to show up and then get insta-popped 2 seconds into the fight.
---
I can try those things, though I don't know if those are my problem. I've edited my original post with more info. Thanks!
---
Brazilians in my experience are more known for begging and scamming. But they do cheat if you give them the opportunity.A good example for me was Pirates of the Burning Sea, had tons of BR scammers.
---
Thanks for the screenshot! I'll give it a shot, but I don't know if it's the problem. I put more information in the original post.
---
Well, seeing that for context would definitely make this situation funny and mainly because what he did here probably wasn't optimal ;).
---
Really? Name doesn't ring a bell. I recently dropped it after receiving enough toxicity from the NA community. I worked with WG on it for a bit, and they just don't seem to put any effort in anymore.
---
I spent most of the winter getting top 500 NA, and had quite a few leaderboard games.
---
You've got my vote bro
---
I'm not being disengenuous about this.  It's hard to say what solutions work for the "problem" without you saying how it affects your gameplay in a negative way.
---
This purposes sound good.
---
Great interview.
---
so this already happens in med sites(due to recons, cloakies), and when it does traffic comes to a stop, people talk about the trap in local, and the gank fleet is lucky to get any kills. only at peak times of the week is it worth even trying due to how quick the traffic dies. Once in a while you see an astero fleet do this in small/novice to the same affect. In any case, further encouraging this type of game play only result in fewer pvp interaction in and around the site. In other words, no, this concept is a content strangler, rather than a generator.
---
Combat ceptors would be mostly fine if AFs weren't so strong. An AF can do the combat ceptor role better than any ceptor, particularly since the addition of the ADC.
---
I'm not really sure why AFs get such a tiny sig radius. That makes more sense as an interceptor feature.
---
I never oppose more connectivity. The lower Eve's active population becomes, the more connectivity we'll need to shoot each other.
---
Oh I remember that dude. He ran an Astero bot 24/7 in Deklein. When he would come through roaming the Astero would scout for him (not even his main, an alt scouting an alt) and he would be in an instawarp Kiki. Was pretty dumb, chased him all the time and wouldn't take a fight, only gank. If he 1v1s it'll probably be a cyno and a dread/carrier alt, with him claiming 1v1 since he flies both carriers. Living in Hagilur is par for the course for that kind of pilot.
---
Your videos are better by miles. Don't worry about it, keep making good content.
---
There are lower end sites. People usually say just to run havens and sanctums but that's bad advice for a legit newbie. I have a myrmidon that can tank 300dps per second and thats usually enough to run a Hidden Den. It's alpha friendly too.
---
Docking mechanics need to be tied back to sov. And people shouldn’t be able to farm missions without contributing to war effort. In fact, PvE shouldn't be the main and most viable source of FW LP. Could be a supporting activity you can do when not doing actual FW work.
---
No I am talking like refuges and really low tier stuff think frigate and destroyer sites.
---
So just to clarify, because of infinite Anoms, bounty generation, cap umbrellas etc. You feel logging in after downtime and stymiing someone's Gameplay for 23 hours while not even being in the same room as your computer (or even remote in) you do not think this mechanic should be touched in a vaccum, 
---
-(by which I mean it should only be modified along with other game mechanics, even tho when you alter many game mechanics in different areas at the same time most devs fuck it up eventually)-
---
, even if it means you can do the same thing (just remote in every several hours)? Again not judging, cuz then I'd be judging myself lmao
---
But those sites already exist? You can run abyssal sites in cruisers or frigates anywhere and dens, rally points and hubs are easily done in most cruisers, even with low skills.
---
&gt;The mass buff would increase it to balance things, allowing wormholers to bring in capitals to null and risk them.
---
Would also allow Nullsec alliances to bring capitals into WH systems.
---
Do you think anything is broken in wormhole space? And if so, how would you fix it?
---
Very nice work my dude.
---
I can make the same amount of money as a ratting carrier(and as consistent) in a PvP fit Ishtar in low-sec, sitting in one system
---
If you are running the C5 versions with a dual Nestor setup, it's possible to clear the rats and hack the cans simultaneously without slowing down your clear speed. It's a nice bit of bonus. Definitely don't hack all the cans in the data sites, since the vast majority will be worthless. This is one place where I recommend cargo scanning.
---
Everyone is complaining about it. Yet everybody does the same. The goons, Nc, Test et cetera. Even the low sec swellers and wormhole divers.  Dont point the finger just to one party.
---
They only fight what they can win. NC had more fights that could win but didnt bother to form at all. 
---
Thats what I dont understand. That before even deployment started , with just rumours, the tribute are dropped on his back and put the legs up. Immediately they unanchor important structures and started to evac the region. This is standard tactic for minimum losses.
---
Most of the time the regions Vale of the Silent and Tribute is barely any activity.  Two engagements worth mentioning. The rest no engagement at all as a resistance. Almost no cyno hammers active in the region. 
---
Hit n run tactics were posted as defence. 
---
I only saw NC/horde used ceptors once in the last two weeks as I fly through the region.
---
No bombers and smart bombing roks cynoed in.?
---
Just an idea that works against bigger fleets.
---
Almost no cyno jammers active in any system.
---
I got the feeling PanFam doesnt care about the space .  Let the home be glassed. They just waging the Isk so when the imperium leaves. They have a budget to rebuild n restart.  
---
There is so much more they can do to defend their space. IF they wanted to. Numbers aint everything.  
---
The could consolidate space just like Delve and evac  eveything. Blow up their own ihubs to safe isk to pay etc. 
---
Come on. Whats going on with then ?
---
Does the Imperium value their rival too much. 
---
I think at this point its a disappointment for the imperium. 
---
They expect too much from Nc dock. 
---
What do you guys think?
---
100% this. For those who are scared of how hard it will be to move into one (like I was), don't worry, it's really not that hard. I just joined Stranger Danger a week ago and I've actually been enjoying eve for the first time in a long while.
---
You are trolling. Rorquals were always with mining ops just usually in a POS shield for boosts.
---
&gt; Army of Mango and a lot of their available literature (that I can read, to be fair) is heavily anti-bot
---
I suspect their anti-bot stance will suffer the same fate as their initial statement of not bluing large entities, not owning sov for the first couple months, and not seeking conflict with current Chinese residents.
---
Hmm. Didn't keep YouTube from recommending the Sonic trailer.
---
We needed more poi also Joe not to be bad
---
You guys don't....scan it? Before you attempt a gank?
---
Of course we did. It died. Just not on the first wave. ;)
---
Rorqual guide when
---
Probably nothing. On the other hand, what's the issue? (This is not the only example. I don't remember others off the top of my head, but it's not uncommon to have redundant requirements.)
---
I know some weird requirements are holdovers from prior versions of the ship trees. If something is weird but not actually broken, CCP might choose to just leave it in place. I've no idea whether that's the case for the freighters requirements.
---
Please keep making videos. Always love them!!
---
Yeah, that's my fear as a relatively new solo player. That joining the big coalitions will turn me into a grunt and meatshield at the cost of my isk and time. But everyone says the EVE is a social game and it thrives as such. Hard to land on a corp because of it and seeing the warning signs after I sign up.
---
We're living in 20,019 with our 16:9 meanwhile Triglavians living in 33,333 with their ultrawide aspect ratios.
---
I'm hoping Tier 2 = REINFORCE ALL STRUCTURES IN AFFECTED SYSTEMS
---
Tier 3 = DESTROY ALL STRUCTURES IN AFFECTED SYSTEMS
---
1) No. The bad sides of multiboxing are the economic effects. The good side is it is one area in which you can realize yourself as an impressive player (e.g. multiboxing skills). In either case, it is high-end gameplay which should be considered only after one or few years of actually playing your account.
---
2) Docking mechanics need to be tied back to sovereign faction. And people shouldn’t be able to farm missions without contributing to war effort. In fact, PvE shouldn't be the main and most viable source of FW LP. Could be a supporting activity you can do when not doing actual FW work. And I am saying this as someone who has farmed 100b in FW missions.
---
I'm not sure whether there is a fix for LS in general.
---
3) 1H axe + shield
---
4) I think CSM in past few years has evolved from overly represented nullsec krabbing interests, to understanding the problems which overfarming and krabbing based empires cause in the Eve ecosystem. Many of them would agree with me on that Eve needs more explosions. Particular changes went into the game that is good for that vision (e.g. FAX repair nerf). Yet, they still are far away from fully understanding more precise problems. Particularly the vitality of the umbrella defense mechanics and do something about it. Those mechanics are ones that cause the lack of explions; both the lack of major wars (my definition of this is a war where two huge capital forces willingly skirmish with each other), and daily content.
---
o7 , glad to see your still around. I really enjoyed your videos and streams.

---
Yeah you need to go deeper. Thats how it is. Especially if your starting point is from high sec. There are thousands of players sitting in high sec (or on the edge) because its "safe", so any wormhole you run into is very likely already been scanned. Thats why you have 2 options. Go deeper, if you really wish to do it from high sec, or go to low sec / null and do it from there. If you want to explore, honestly, consider joining Test in null, because they are located in Sansha  pirate portion of the map (the best pirate faction). When you are in null, you now have 2 options; you can roam around known space (from system to system) and do sites (which give you less loot, but still WAY more than high sec) AND you can go into wormholes as well, if you run into a good one. On average when i delved into wormholes, i had to go through 5-7 before id get 200 mil in loot. Once you get good skills and a good ship (like astero with good base bonuses) you can start applying various tricks that will save you time. For example when you go into a wormhole that you know doesnt have no combat sites, you do a single widest possible scan, and you observe the map; once the scan is done if i remember correctly, the sites that move the least, will be c1-c3 wormholes; all other sites are high scanning difficulty, so when you scan with widest setting they will jump all over the map. Since you cant run them anyway, everything thats left will be wormholes :)
---
I disagree. I like the idea of new players having more to do where they are. But I really don’t like the idea of all the content in the game being available everywhere. I think the more difference in different parts of space the better. Sites, ore, moon goo, etc. otherwise just get rid of sec statuses altogether and make it all just free empty space with everything
---
What nullsec power bloc is currently supporting your run for CSM?
---
Wait a goddamn second! Andres Afanador is voting for you? How do I revoke my vote pledge?!?!  /s
---
Make generic alpha character. Contract items to that character.
---
Fair point but higher end content would still only spawn in null. So notall content would be available.
---
I agree, it is a trash change.  I run combat sites for my isk btw.
---
Absolutely compatible with my "more explosions" goal.
---
Not his titan pilot, but please stalk it all the same.
---
Cloaky camping isn't the cause. It's a symptom of a game state where perfect intel and instant teleportation make true stealth and guerilla tactics exceedingly difficult.
---
At EVE Northeast a few years ago, Fozzie said something like "Cloaking and local are two sides of the same coin. In an ideal world, if you nerf one, you nerf the other to balance it out."
---
What's your opinion on WH state today, and what changes would you push ?
---
Also I think Jonny UK said he would vote for you too.
---
Lol he said the same thing to me when I told him you're voting for me.
---
I feel like Jon Snow bringing wildlings and the night's watch together.
---
Yeah... I’ve reached 5 million SP and have basically focused on gallente... I can fly frigates and destroyers of other factions tho(and pirate frigs and such)
---
I can field medium and light t2 drones; t2 neuts, t2 Light blasters and railguns, that sort of thing(so basically anything Gallente t2 and below that an Alpha can use, I can use)
---
&gt;4) New Wormholes with Massive NS Statics: Either nullsec statics for C6s, or completely new wormhole systems with nullsec statics with 25m mass. This would support multiple dreads in and out. The aim here is to increase wormholer/nullseccer interaction in an Eve which the active population is dwindling. 
---
 Get the pitchforks boys, we've heard enough. (Nullseccer btw) 😋
---
Agreed. Contstantly having to scan down random scouts for borderline barely any rewards has been most boring eve experience for me so far.
---
Hopefully next stages bring some actual content.
---
Please this.
---
1. What do you think the worst change to EVE has been in the past 1 year?
---
2. How will you engage the community during your CSM term?
---
3. If elected, do you promise to ask CCP, at least once, to buff the Enforcer so it's no longer The Worst Covops Ship in EVE Online?
---
4. In your ideal world, what does Project Nova look like?
---
Horde is the only one with explicit/confirmed support.
---
Am I in Goon ballots confirmed?
---
PS: Last position in a ballot doesn't mean much endorsement, but I'll take it.
---

Pasting the WH section of my CSM bid:
---
Anaoikis / J-Space / Wormhole Space
---
Wormhole space is one of the rare places where there are actual diminishing returns to growing larger, n+1 doesn’t always prevail, and selective recruiting is still valuable. It is the space closest to my ideals for Eve. This doesn’t however mean everything is perfect. Actually, due to long periods of underrepresenation, wormholer worries often are less of a priority for CCP. I am not a “real” wormholer candidate, but I do live in wormhole space on and off, I know what these worries are, and I’ll make sure to represent them. Specifically;
---
The balance between capital farming and mjd battleship farming meta needs to change to favor more capital farming.
---
To accomplish the above, we need scrams/scramming towers in wormhole anomalies.
---
Wormholes should be made more lucrative again. Getting rid of ship respawns was a good change in terms of motivating farming in the static, but the drifter boss is too much of a income nerf in terms of isk/ehp. Given that items (particularly PLEX) in the game keep inflating due to ISK being pumped in the game by nullsec, it’s only fair wormholes get incremental frequent buffs in ISK/hr.
---
A whole load of bugs in wormhole space need to be addressed.
---
There needs to be at least one person to prevent the “collateral damage”. I’m willing to do this in case no “real” wormholer gets elected.
---
My question was less directed to the specifics of any future changes (I am willing to accept almost anything as better than the current system) than to the degree to which you will push CCP to actually implement some changes.
---
Are you going to come out of the gate saying "Faction Warfare needs to be fixed, and it needs to be fixed now," or are you going to say, "hey, Faction Warfare is one thing on a long list of priorities that need fixing, and it's okay if it's two years down the line"?
---
Max tank jump freighter with implants and all the proper equipment, showing highsec gankers they don't have enough alts to gank it.
---
Good, fuck gangers. Nice to watch them(most likely just 1 person running dozens accounts again) loose, for once.
---
Cloaky camping is not what I'm referring to in my questions, I truly believe in this style of Gameplay and with fozzie sov or whatever it's called its necessary to save time for attackers. What I'm referring to is the fact that someone can never be home but for ten minutes, and they have effected someone else's Gameplay for 23 hours, with no further commitment required... So AFK cloaky camping. I appreciate your response and you still have my vote irregardless, I wish for the wheel to be broken (just don't burn me with dragonfire afterwards)
---
o7
---
In the lasts csm's we saw no  dissenting opinions being expressed publically by csm members to any ideeas ccp pushed forward(maybe except the judge). It was either praise or silence.
---
If you get elected are you going to break the wheel on this or maintain the status quo?
---
You could go find a good wormholer Corp, and have miles of fun fighting your neighbors, with your corpmates.
---
This Bounty Hunter is my kind of scum, fearless and inventive.
---
I really like the fleet warp at the end. Goes to show you what one guy, alot of alts and too much time on his hands can do.
---
Some good thought there definitely. Triglavian sites appearing in K space would need to be linked to the invasions somehow ... Maybe in invasion systems only they spawn. Perhaps spying on us like the Jove Observatories.
---
Alternatively have a different kind of frig only non-combat abyssal deadspace pockets where the timer is only 15 minutes and you have to hack the cans. If you fail then the timer before the pocket collapses gets shorter. The storyline could be that the pockets were abandoned once the invasions started or something.
---
What? I mean just looking at the video and pretend he went towards the gate. Measure the distance he traveled before POOF. (Obviously traveling at a projectile is even higher dps than a transversal)  but I honestly dont think he had any chance besides bribing them lol.
---
Straight from the mouth of pgl himself
---
This^ 
---
I have a little 2.5" I'm using for a hwinfo monitor.
---
Using as 32" TV wallmounted as my main display. Looking to move up to a 144hz curved.
---
I guess so, that’s true. A potential downside to that though is either
---
1) there will be an increased number of anoms in space which is potentially negative because without any way to offset that isk generation then more turbo krabing and more inflation
---
2) same number of anoms but randomized between every option. Then the null eaters who are used to their havens suddenly have less of them, so they’re just running whatever is available leaving the newbros with still nothing to do.
---
&gt; 1) Adaptive anomaly respawns: 
---
This is an interesting proposal, how would it take into account though that some ratting systems are better than others (due to sec status) and are currently abandoned not because there isn't anyone to occupy them but because the spawns inside are shit?
---
I’m not going to say how FOBs should be implemented other than that they need to be balanced correctly. 
---
I am simply saying that if you want to limit structure proliferation without touching ref timers, this is a way to do it.
---
is your name a parody of something
---
I will break the wheel.
---
I am no metagamer or empire builder. I am not running for recognition, "being relevant", or "furthering the interests of my empire". I genuinely care about Eve's health, and I wouldn't hesitate to speak out in both the CSM room and outside (as far as the NDA allows).
---
I would absolutely do it in a civilized way though. At the end of the day we are nerds loving/playing the same game.
---
I’m not going to comment on how FOBs should be implemented other than they need to be balanced for what they are. 
---
I’m simply saying that if you want to limit structure proliferation without touching ref timers, this is a way to do it.
---
Please, you go A-types, slaves, max jump freighter skill and all the hardwire implants. 
---
I'm waiting for the ability to use mutaplasmids on the a-types. Or rigs. Or something else. More hitpoints = more content.
---
Would rather have wormholes be capital-free zones, TBH.
---
Make Eve a proper F2P game, not a glorified trial, would be the only way to do it but that just won't happen.
---
We need to bring baseline income for new players way up so they can take risks from the get go. If anything the game should be SAFER for a newbie, and they should have more means to bounce back without joining a null alliance that teaches them not to undock without SRP.
---
delete jump drives on combat ships.
---
To the sun!!!
---
Thats quite a unbased comment here. RELNT was a long standing lowsec group who took sov in gemi against impossible numbers before PH offered them to join. Their pvp skill is certain and they certainly wont take any of your alts. The stupidness of that dude is certain too though. Agree on the report go ahead.
---
Old news
---
We can only hope. 
---
But then another problem arises: Does he listen to the loudest posters, or the more reasonable posters?
---
1. Remove sovereignty structures/entosis mechanics and place those functions into a singular two cycle citadel that has no offensive weaponry and a 7 day reinforcement window.
---
2. Remove faxes or retool them for anti subcap combat (super nimble fighters) and restore super carrier and carrier remote repair functionality (with triage available for both), while maintaining the diminishing returns on remote reps (this really was all the capital changes now amount to, tbh, after fax/remote repair nerf).
---
3. Remove Rorquals current functionality and turn them into mobile manufacturing or heavy mineral jump freighters, with huger ore/compressed ore bays, buffing the orca and porpoise fleet boosts and hit points to accommodate, double or triple mining barge output, with orca keeping the current PANIC mechanic.
---
That'd be me.
---
I can't decide who's more annoying.. Johnny Pew or Chance Ravinne.
---
In [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g5Hz17C4is) manner more or less
---
Can u just make me new snuff leader please?
---
Who am I supposed to blame for lowsec sucking now?
---
Specifically, how can you tell if the WH doesn't have combat stats? I assume there is some sort of list somewhere that tells me what each WH / system is?!?
---
CCP
---
What are your thoughts on making low sec great again, if that’s possible?
---
I had a similar problem in another game. I was at the end of my wits. I used the repair game utility, and that solved it completely. Don't know if Eve had one, but if not reinstalling might help.
---
Do you feel that the disparity between isk making opportunities in null sech vs. Low sec is in a good place? If yes, please explain.  If no, what do you think could be done to resolve it?
---
What is your stance on skill farms. Do you think they benefit the game?
---
So where to order those? Need it for the next meeting with middlemanagers :)
---
Boosh ravens?
---
Here is the thing.
---
I think nullsec ecosystem fixes are more of a priority than FW fixes atm. But I also think most important of FW fixes are easier to implement. I wouldn't disagree or be offended if they worked on the FW proposals I listed, before working on some of my proposals about nullsec.
---
I think null ecosystem issues are more important. But there is no denying FW fixes are long overdue. And CCP can't focus on only one area of the game. Same goes with wormholes.
---
Ultimately it falls to CCP to decide to work on FW. If other CSMs came together and made it a priority this year, I would join that group. But I can't convince CCP/CSM to make it a priority.
---
As one of 15,000 content customers , I'd like to say thanks. Not only did you share knowledge and theorycraft, you shared a mindset that changed the way I play the game. And when I had very little IRL play money, you gave me the damn book for free. 
---
Thank you.
---
You can get stuff like that here.
---
GOTG (as dumb as that name is its still better than whatever the mongrel dogs in the coalition are coming up with) betrayed Panfam? They literally negotiated a deal that covered only them last year and not the rest of the Northern alliances, claiming they had been brutally camped for months (despite the fact this was happening everywhere.)
---
Then, when PH and PL reset them for fights, they played the victim card every chance they got. They threatened that if PH and BL didnt stop shooting them, theyd fight beside Goons next time rather than provide their measly amount of titans at the next Keepstar battle. Despite a long history of these groups never having extensive blue lists maintained for years, they were gnashing their teeth at the idea that suddenly they didnt have the Panfam support net they enjoyed so much previously.
---
The victim complex GOTG posters have is almost on par with that of Test and their "abloo bloo bloo, we are the underdogs all the time everyone is trying to destroy us, we are so weak" when being bluetral to the 2nd largest coalition in the game allied to the 1st largest coalition. Its pathetic, really.
---
So iirc that guy is from Immediate Destruction &lt;IED&gt; and may have an alt corp [https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98583242/](https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98583242/). Theyre now affiliated with Horde but im not sure of their role in there.
---
I thought burning shit down just for the lulz was a valid form of playstyle in EVE.
---
If it was the loudest we would’ve had a low-sec gate to stain years ago
---
Sorry, but I meant AFK cloaky camping. When the defenders have perfect information about who is in each system, the ONLY way to obscure that information is to always be in the system. Unless local chat and/or cynos are nerfed in some way, AFK camping is the logical solution to "how do we prevent them from knowing exactly where we are, and in what numbers, all the time?"
---
Give a man a torpedo, and he'll be content for an evening. Give a man a "Torpedo Delivery" handbook, and well... he'll be both content and make others content for the rest of his life.
---
I can definitively appreciate what you've done, truly going above and beyond.
---
I think if CCP does implement any dynamic spawning system it'll likely give a chance for better sites to spawn in higher true sec systems based on how distance from active farming areas. 
---
Would make the low value systems more habitable if they are at the 'goldilocks' range from large empires.
---
Yeh but you ruin the one thing that Whs use to roam and not be dropped. 
---
Those holes are just too much of a risk to leave open, so Wh corps would be forced to crit them.
---
Thank you for your time and kind responses, best of luck and skill to you
---
&gt; You feel logging in after downtime and stymiing someone's Gameplay
---
I don't think people stopping anomaly farming just because I am in their system is a bad thing. Overfarming is a big economic issue. And those people have more creative alternatives like Abyss running. The impact of cloaky camping against umbrella regions and botters is more significant than the real people in smalltime regions.
---
I also think if it is ever to be fixed, the fix shouldn't be invasive to other playstyles. E.g. if you introduce fuel or a forceful decloak, you'll make lives of supers traveling thru hostile space miserable. Moreover, here are more legit uses of cloaky camping. Wormholers use it for intel during evictions for example. Imagine going to sleep during an eviction. You watch the citadel, record your screen, and rewatch the "survaillence footage" next day to see whether anyone logged in. There are very legitimate uses of cloaky camping which any change would hinder.
---
You're called a racist because you assume it is the Chinese and only the Chinese playerbase that bots, there are bots everywhere and from every nationality. Before the Chinese it was the Russians who were always accused of botting, but never to the level of vitriol a lot of the anti-Chinese pisting has gotten to here sometimes.
---
&gt;But I really don’t like the idea of all the content in the game being available everywhere. I think the more difference in different parts of space the better.
---
I’m fine with content being different everywhere, but I will say that as much as possible, content should have a proper spread vertically in difficulty as well as laterally across space. Won’t work for everything, but it’s a huge improvement in environment for everyone.
---
Would rather get rid of Astrahus T-Rex farming so people actually bring their caps out to play.  This would bring back the rage rolling days of old.  And lead to more big explosions.

---
Yeah please add a fuel requirement so all of J space gets fucked some more.
---
Would you support Heavy Covert Bombers?
---
Like a destroyer or cruiser hull with heavy focused damage bombs that travel 50km. Specifically designed to counter capital blobs.
---
A massive ball of cruise battleships (doesn’t actually have to be Ravens) approaching an anchor or FC, that is also surrounded by a dozen or more command dessies fitted with micro jump field generators. Gets to play games with the math regarding the citadel perimeter. Generally considered to be the least fun comp in existence to fight against. Can destroy Keepstars (with some damage soakers), and Fortizars with relative ease.
---
I am from that corp and i will take the 1v1. Also btw that dude is retarded and you were just talking to all his alts.
---
or just leave rorquals as they am, some of us in goons mine with there alts or just have 1 rorqual that would force people to mine with set groups, set times or areas were other people have these boosting platforms.

Think if your changes happened how bad it would be with Dsons its bad now having to clean up after them and wasting play time because they cherry pick
---
me
---
You're only affected by the cloaky camper if you let yourself be affected.  Go about your day.  If he's afk, you have nothing to worry about.  If he's not, you can defend yourself, can't you?  You wouldn't live in space you can't defend, would you? That would be silly...
---
Step one: Get rid of the entire CCP management team
---
Of course, the fuel idea I had is ofc variable and needs balance. In regards to the super issue, move it six hours before downtime and bring at least six units of the new fuel. And yes I have done the screen cap thing no clue how to solve it for longer than whatever amount of time is decided for balance issues but referring back to the faction cloak idea, maybe a half fuel usage so that I can get half a day out of it. 
---
I absolutely do NOT want other styles of Gameplay changed because of the "wah cloaky campers" argument. I just strongly feel us as cloaky campers (either on the side or whatever) need to make the change first or not only will it damage us, there will be more "collateral damage".
---
Including the guy who travels and cloaks often, I don't think activation should require fuel FYI, none of these people need change their life style other than making room for a few M3, maybe even less lol
---
That's you :), if you play Eve Online for free. You are what's called an alpha. Basically, you have restrictions on the ships that you can fly (it usually doesn't matter within the first few months) and your skills train slower than paid players (called omega). Capsuleer is the in-game name for players, because we all live in a small ship called a capsule. Clone is a reference to how your player avatar is a clone, so when you die, your consciousness is moved to another clone.
---
So an alpha clone capsuleer is an eve player who plays for free!
---
Lol just noticed that. It works well enough if you hold the phone horizontal.
---
Other than that, might be worth adding Disintegrators on the list as well.
---
Honestly who cares, structure proliferation is just not a problem for a sandbox game.
---
Could you paraphrase it here please?
---
Cheers o7
---
CCPlease unban lenny and ironbank, we need another casino war.
---
Zero tolerance for this type off comments. 
---
This is a social game and improper behaviour should be punished. Its not the matter if thicker skin.
---
True but it's hard to expect everyone to be able to deal with anything from a single t3 to the blops drop from the hell at any moment and imo unreasonable. If they cannot defend yes I think they should die or even I should die if I'm not able, but I don't think it's unreasonable to think that the victory is hollow if I never drop, not by choice but because I'm not even there lol
---
1. The insistence of CCP to make jump bridges fatigue free, and allow ships in while pointed, for the sake of a mere slogan motivation of "making it just like real gates".
---
2. I've been a rather transparent person. I am pretty active on reddit and I plan to open a discord channel to be accessible. I also plan to be active on CSM discord, unlike many CSMs. We have many disagreements with Brisc, but I respect his accessibility and active engagement with the community. He would be my example.
---
3. Sure. Cloaking enthisuasts are one of the groups I plan to directly represent. I've never used that ship though, so we should talk. Perhaps the very fact that I've never used it proves that CCP should look into it.
---
4. I really have no expertise on FPS stuff. The one thing I know is that it is really hard for people to make FPS games that manages to differentiate themselves from others in the market. Looking good or being tied to an already rich universe alone isn't enough. There needs to be innovative mechanics for people to adopt a game as a multiplayer activity.
---
Is this a place to ask eco for follow-ups or to we wait for the ama
---
Report them if they do . Its not proper since its space pixels.
---
So to boil down your response to #4.
---
Even though you understand your chosen play-style causes issues with other players, it should remain the same.  However, other people's play-styles, which make your chosen style harder, are the ones that need to be changed?
---
it might help to have a quick reference chart on the front listing all the faction resists, i.e.
---
Race | Weakest Resist | Strongest
---
----|--------------|---------
---
T2 Amarr | Thermal | Explosive
---
T2 Minmatar | Kinetic | EM
---
Something like that.
---
Wormhole space needs a voice. This is best option. #1 on my ballet.
---
Russians and Chinese fully deserve that reputation.
---
Good idea, I'll have a look at adding those in the near future!
---
How can we answer that. I enjoy it along with thousands of other people, will you? I don't know. Make an account and have a try, it costs nothing
---
If people ignore the cloaky camper, and he's afk, he has no effect.  If people bait out and kill him or his cyno buddies, there is content and that's good.  If the people cannot defend their space against whatever comes through the cyno, they don't deserve to live in peace in that space. Goons seem to live in Delve just fine despite many of their systems camped 23/7.
---
If someone does read my thought and take it seriously I hope I made it clear later in my posts it needs to be looked at from front to back to avoid that. I personally don't mind taking 12 m3 of an object into J space officer cloak my tengu and hope I don't get lost for more than several days(accounting for me remaining cloaked for twelve different 1 hour periods of time, or maybe 2 hour periods idk, as I said officer cloaks can help make being afk cloaky camping for a longer time viable without having to refuel, and perhaps help Olmecas above example of screen recording for an eviction) . 
---
I do NOT want Collat damage and if the whers reeee in unison at a pre patch note that adds this I too will grab my pitchfork. "and then they came for me".
---
Part 2 is an invasion of low sec maybe? Hope that they start burning down citadels.
---
A specific system's mining/ratting respawn rates would be a factor of:
---
- Sov upgrades
---
- Amount of mining/ratting done in the entire nullsec in the past week
---
- Truesec
---
Currently if you do all the upgrades it spawns enough anomalies to feed buttloads of people. Under my system, systems with lower truesec would be more precious and worthy to be taken again.
---
Why are you such a twat?
---
&gt; Well, there's one reason to bring them into panfam, because then they don't fight panfam. 
---
What? What are you talking about?
---
&gt; Panfam is so busy "being elite" and only accepting "elites" that they're just cutting their cake smaller and smaller because no other bits of the cake measure up to their standard.
---
What? Elites? Horde? *what*?
---
Someone come claim your beebot, it’s hurt itself.
---
Totally, I don't want to imply it's every corp there. Member corps tend to be a different set of rules and cultures to them.
---
you know you can steal their drifters right
---
how many "ur mom gay" did you get
---
Where do you smartbomb pods?
---
Yes.  Olmeca has absolutely no self-awareness whatsoever.
---
That doesnt mean its right.  No one should be called stupid or to die and commit suicide. Or 
---
The same as calling this a troll. Its not fucking funny.  The right thing to do is correct their behaviour and letting them now you dont accept this shit.
---
&gt;I think nullsec ecosystem fixes are more of a priority than FW fixes atm. But I also think most important of FW fixes are easier to implement.
---
I would tend to agree with both of these points, but I'd also raise the fact that there have been something like four major attempts to fix nullsec since FW was last seriously looked at.  As long as FW isn't framed as "the thing CCP should fix," it will likely continue to be completely or almost-completely ignored.  
---
Any major changes to FW are likely to inject new life into the warzones, if only because the novelty will draw people back.  In contrast, based on historical evidence, changes to nullsec are less likely to have such an immediate and salutary effect, if only because no set of changes will come close to pleasing everyone and because any changes will step on far more toes than will changes to FW (where all of the major players remaining (there aren't many of them) are begging for literally anything).  
---
&gt;And CCP can't focus on only one area of the game.
---
True, but it does have to pick priorities and allocate resources.  Since 2014, there has been essentially no evidence of any prioritization of, or allocation of resources to, FW design.  All I'm asking for is that the CSM make it clear that they think CCP should prioritize FW and that they're willing to sacrifice some other things on their wishlist (by no means everything) to ensure that it happens within some definable timeframe, preferably the next year or so.
---
&gt;It is absolutely "FW's turn" to get some love, in a sense.  Ultimately it falls to CCP to decide to work on FW. If other CSMs came together and made it a priority this year, I would join that group. But I can't convince CCP/CSM to make it a priority.
---
You've hit on the emotional, admittedly illogical core of my stance here with that "FW's turn" comment.  My only problem with what you're saying is that you've indicated you don't intend to take an active role in getting the CSM to focus on lobbying for FW changes.  If every person elected to the CSM takes the same position you take here, FW will spend another year being entirely ignored unless CCP decides to make the changes on its own initiative.
---
I'm not saying you need to be the lone voice howling in the wilderness for FW changes to the detriment of all of your other priorities, but it'd be nice if you could say that you'll raise the issue fairly frequently and that you'll make clear that you think that the (relative) ease of fixing FW and the long time it has gone without fixes mean it deserves to be put near the top of the list.

These are specific wormhole systems.
---
Wormholers would be agreeing to the risk of getting capblobbed when they populate these wormholes.
---
They wouldn't connect to other (currently settled) wormholes in the same way. So it's impossible to use them against some already settled wormhole.
---
I'm still waiting for Torpedo 2: Electric Boogalo, featuring how tips for how how to warp your Widow to a POS, and how to manipulate the Thukker Large Cap Battery market.
---
You're missing the point.  Astra farming sucks because it allows people to spawn the T-Rex, then wait until a later time and kill them in absolute safety without undocking anything valuable.  People used to farm the high end sites with caps, so rage rolling C5/C6 space to kill caps was a thing.  That's dead. There used to be epic fights in J space when one group tackled another group's ratting caps. Losses ran into the billions.  It was fantastic - hang out on comms while rolling, then intense fights that lasted.  That's all gone now because I can do the same thing wihtout undocking.  Who gives a shit if you can steal the T rex?  I want to kill your caps, and have to fight to save my caps.
---
you son of a bitch....
---
This needs to be upvoted higher.
---
Oh gawd, even his alliance name is cringe, X or die was at it's coolest when bieber said it... sooo, never... Also, Pandemic Horde, ew, they run with Fraternity, which is full of known botters. If you want the chance to hunt them down you should see if you can get in with either TEST or Goon Swarm. Test has a pretty good alliance and training program specifically for noobs - Brand Newbros - I don't know if Goons have anything similar, but I'm sure they do. (TEST is totally better tho :P)
---
You make a good point on how the expansion of nullsec inflated the economy and redenred other forms of pve obsolete. Like in a good pvp mmo the map should be lively with people travelling and running sites like combat exploration offer but the rewards are so bad when you can buy a super for 10bil instead. Even if the ratting is mind numbing at the end of the day you want some form of reward for your pve. I think the whole subject needs to be looked at. How much life nullsec drains from formerly lively areas of the map. Also it might look good to see noobs inject into supers for ccp but the gameplay is so boring i think a fair bit just burn out and quit the game. Combat explo is really fun to do and to hunt runners but rewards suck abuss is fun addition but it removes targets from the map. I think ccp needs to focus on dynamic pve where the runner faces various sites and has to travel in a shiny ship. Can you look into that?
---
no, changing fundamental mechanics for a single ship is a terrible idea, the last thing this game needs is *even more* exceptions and obtuse mechanics
---
&gt;What I'm referring to is the fact that someone can never be home but for ten minutes, and they have effected someone else's Gameplay for 23 hours, with no further commitment required... So AFK cloaky camping.
---
As mentioned above, one of the viable ways to counter super umbrella strongholds that have perpetuated for years is cloaky camping.
---
If not for cloaky campers and the likes of BB and Delve incursion fleets, how runaway do you think the safety of strongholds would have become?
---
I'd rather cloaky campers didn't exist and I love the idea of fuel for cloaks. But as the "runaway stronghold" problem is real and happening, I'd rather see it retained until there is balance.

The UK also has a fair old bunch of vets for its size. I suspect there are other countries as well though I can't think of them at the moment.
---
I respect that opinion, I just don't necessarily agree. I'm a tad old school in so far as the HTFU attitude, but we have people here who aren't doing that in their first week, and instead of learning that lesson and growing to be awesome Capsuleers to feed Rorqs to someone in a year or several-&gt;
---
they just leave instead cuz they think it's senseless for someone who isn't actually playing the game to have an effect on them(granted we know if they aren't there they won't do anything) and having the conversation and realization we just had in regards to how to deal with cloaky campers either never happens in their outfit or they simply don't understand, and back to fortnite and one less sub for us.
---
Also I think using goons as the crux of your "they defend fine" argument might need some polish, they literally use tits instead of subcaps for some responses lol(Olympics Fist in the air)
---
What times do you play? I’ve been trying to get fights in abyssals and never get the pvp room
---
Thank you for your kind responses and criticism everyone
---
Im hearing voices again.. :/
---
No, just no. If you live in null sec your alliance most likly has citidels in it's closest low sec. Al so if you choose to rat just get g cruiser 2 and use a vni. Its is some thing you most likly get with in the first few weeks of playing.
---
No good sir. Thank you for the ongoing and civil conversation :)
---
You did mention maybe putting these as C6, i just wanted to address the issues with that. 
---
As new maybe c7 wormholes thats an interesting idea. Although a couple evictions and people might stop living there. 
---
Would be an interesting base for someone like yourself to temp base out of them with a small dread fleet.
---
I made nearly 2 trillion from Excavator booshing. It entirely hinges on the fact that people can fill so many Rorquals in a single region. Yet, I argue for things like adaptive anomaly respawns to limit the amount of Rorquals per region. In other words, I argue to make less money.
---
Between Mar5hy and me we have 300 accounts. I argue that people should have 1 CSM vote per person (not per account). Against my own interest.
---
There are many occasions I argue against my own interest, for the game's health. In this occasion, I don't perceive multiboxing as huge a problem as some of you folks do.
---
can you add a dark mode button
---
even better: make dark more default with a white mode for people who hate batteries and their eyes
---
Baseline income is just fine, if you don't think it's high enough you are doing something wrong, you can do escalations, grind lev3/4 missions, explore for relic/data using jspace to get to null, huff.
---
I don't know how you think "teaches them not to undock without SRP" is a thing, I used to be in a null corp, I wouldn't have stood for that, I never heard of people complain about that in game, and if that's what your dealing with you should leave.
---
All he's going to do is bait with a triple rep neut hyperion and drop his haw phoenix. 
---
Source: killed him a few times by baiting his hyperion and counterdropping him
---
Give them a 5km radius warp disruption field generator that only affects nullified ships. They could be used as drags for all the nullified ships.
---
I agree but at the same time the overall mindset given by nullblocks is our playstyle is better than yours and the absolute vast majority is hivemind as hell.
---
Does it mean Tribute will see more resistance now?
---
No, this kind of thinking will dilute what Eve is.
---
Where do you fall on areas of 'emergent gameplay' or gameplay areas that CCP didn't code for? Are CCP doing enough to encourage it and, if not, what should they be doing to do so?
---
There was once a time when my corp wasn't accepted into Goons, despite being one of the founding corps of The Bastion. I'm not sure exactly what broke the horse's back but something changed, and mega-alliances are now a Thing. Internalizing and then frequently keeping a close eye on the weaker links has become a more feasible plan than having a renter empire. 
---
I think that part of that has to do with this broken ass fozziesov. Only the owner can defend. So by putting the vast majority of your humans under one umbrella means more people can help in an actual sov attack.
---
The problem with the former sov system was that it was a bit of a grind and took too long. But with the flood of titans and supercarriers, plus the average size of a nullsec fleet in the current day; a good ol' DPS race with one team hitting, say an IHUB, and the other team trying to take down an SBU so the IHUB becomes invulnerable - the time would be mitigated by alot.
---
Some of the most fun I've ever had in this game was living in Geminate fighting Brick Squad, 40 vs 40, for sov. Tornados had just been released and both sides were using them.
---
It's a two-headed dragon situation. Yes, groups in nullsec are too large. Yes, many mechanics are broken. I hid in a wormhole over a year ago.
---
I used Goons because they've perfected it, but the argument still stands.  If you're a smaller group and you live in jump range of someone bigger and hostile, you will probably lose your shit. You should move.  If you cannot defend, you don't deserve safety.  You're arguing for perfect safety, although you may not realize it.  If you don't want to lose guys to subs, maybe don't let them inject into Rorqs when they don't know how to stay safe.  Maybe teach them those skills before they jump into the deep end?
---
Pasting CSM bid:
---
Docking mechanics need to be tied back to sovereign faction. And people shouldn’t be able to farm missions without contributing to war effort. In fact, PvE shouldn't be the main and most viable source of FW LP. Could be a supporting activity you can do when not doing actual FW work. And I am saying this as someone who has farmed 100b in FW missions.
---
PS: I don't think "vast empty systems of lowsec" is a solvable problem in the current state of Eve.
---
Fair enough
---
You can go as high as you want with PVE in hi/low-sec, putting low tier content in null will only get hoovered up by someone's alt that can fly a battlecruser, and the frustration of newer players trying to get out to null to do them without dealing with null corp politics  will be damaging to the player base.
---
If that idiot had a titan it would have died 12 hours after he bought it. That's my rag spacefriend. And I only play eve like twice a month anymore, I'm getting close to winning the game. I think I have like 5 separate entities trying to smoke it over the last 9 months. And the closest I've come to losing it was when I jumped instead of bridging into 40 dudes, in bubbled nullsec, on top of 8 dreads, with zero tank fit. I welcome the challenge. A hint is that I'm quite keen on solo mining ships around the area.
---
Test Alliance Please Ignore has a great noob alliance, Brand Newbros. I've had a blast so far and gone on quite a few fleets. Basically as long as I show up for the important strat ops if I'm online at the time, I can do whatever I want. The people I've interacted with are really cool, and a few of the fc's have paid SRP out of pocket, and one of them even bought the entire fleet a specific kind of ship and fit just to fuck with the enemy fleet - which, they freaed out and ran bc they'd never seen that ship used in battle before. lololol Seriously tho, good corp, Seddows mom is a god, and Vaportrail is...

---
Is it safe to make blowjob jokes now?
---
Currently, all of New Eden consists of human characters.  I'd like to introduce the concept of creating new races of both NPC and playable pilots that are alien to the universe as we know it.  Yes, I'm talking lizard aliens, grays, klingons, and even arachnids.  Following the same introduction as Triglavians, we have a blueprint for how these factions are introduced into New Eden.  But instead of introducing them strictly as NPC's, I'd like to go a step further and propose the ability to pilot them.  Here's the catch; these are one-life / one-session characters to be used exclusively for pirating.  Names and character personalization are randomized and nothing carries over from one life/session to the next.
---
The Alien-Pirates have strict limitations and end-goals:
---
1. Each region has one Alien-Pirate faction with one station.  Your choice of region or Alien-Pirate dicates the former/latter.  You cannot dock in any station beyond the one you spawned into.
---
2. Alpha characters have a choice to fly Frigates, Destroyers, and Cruisers. Omegas have additional access to Battlecruisers and Battleships.
---
3. The alien technology these Aliens use gives their ships the ability to evolve.  
---
4. After you score X amount of kills /assists on player characters, you have the choice to evolve into the next tier of ship.
---
5. You must be active. If you are inactive for longer than 10 minutes, you are automatically logged off.
---
6. If you are killed, you are logged off and must start over from scratch.
---
By introducing this new pirate mechanic, we create a gaming experience that rewards short-term goals but has both limitations and engaging meaning behind it.  Over time, this could come open up the door to new agents, missions, and even playable races beyond what we have now.  For players looking for short-term achievements, this working concept could fill in the gap that's currently missing from Eve Online.  In addition, it is a great way to introduce PvP to pilots who previously only engaged in PvE activities.

---
welcome to ask me here, im hoping to have an AMA tomorrow, i couldnt spend enough time on reddit today to do it justice.
---
You should also expect to be on the ballot from goonswarm. How do you feel about that?
---
So here is the issue.
---
In an Eve which delivers its premises, you'd have NS to have the greatest risk and greatest reward. Newer players would go to LS first, and then move to NS environment later.
---
Right now, NS has lower risk than LS. This is true for both umbrella and non-umbrella regions of NS. When it comes to reward, high reward activities in LS require expertise to efficiently extract (L5 missions, FW missions), so are rather inaccessible to the new player. Whereas both the high and low reward activities are pretty accessible to new players in NS, which is one of the reasons why null entities are getting the new players.
---
I think Eve should deliver its original promise. For this, I argue for an increased risk (accompained by increased reward) in null. I genuinely don't know how one would go about decreasing risk in lowsec moneymaking, or making it more new player friendly. Perhaps FW missions are friendly to them to some degree.
---
OK, HTFU forever, I'm with it. Again we are all getting older and the younger players get ran out with attitudes like that. I don't quite see how I'm arguing for perfect safety as even in an extreme example of having to be move fuel from cargo to fuel Bay each two hours can be done remotely with the campers phone, may even result in more catches as more afk camping toons will be attended too.
---
There are plenty of communities in the game that are younger eve time wise and don't know these things, I take it your like I used to be and promote giving them the stick until they learn or leave(likely the game entirely). I think they deserve a chance to grow without their only option being join Legacy/Panfam/NC/Imperium or goto WH space lol. But no Rorqs, just kill those for them XD XD 
---
Thank you for your kind response and criticism especially sir/ma'am
---
Still kicking myself for not scoring billions in that market opportunity.
---
Definitely a +1 from me, our playstyles definitely coincide.
---
What's your two cents on NPC Null? How would you improve it to add more folks to shoot in those areas?
---
None, though a LOT of people who I guess assumed I was harvesting their data put their names as "Fake McFakerson."
---
&gt; Currently [below 5% of all nullsec farm converts to explosions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1goutrhQADKczT9MLzA47Crdf3JwsVu5PNDHKN_qIvTs/edit#gid=391531178). In an ideal Eve, that ratio should average about 15%.
---
Why 15?
---
I think you're late to the enlightenment party Mr. Bhudda. I think everyone realizes this within the first couple weeks/months of playing the game.  
---
This is what makes EVE unique to any other MMO or Esport I've ever been involved in. This is true "player faction warfare" to its fullest and how it should be done. You get large blocs and then blocs fall apart or reinvent themselves. People complain about it, but that's the beauty of the game.

Thanks for replying. I wasn't referring to FW persay, but do you have any ideas for content drivers in Low Sec (RIP passive moons and POS)

do you have some idea to bring new player into Eve ?

what you think about Plex, Skill injector/farm and TZ tanking?
---
I was a WoT clan commander and the South Americans in general were a pain to deal with even on the Tier 6 map when that was a thing. But pain &lt;&gt; unbeatable and we handled them.

Constant SP pump in the game is bad. I would be willing to give up my AFK campers for a solution. I don't know what would be a good solution. Haven't heard any ("remove injectors/extractors" is not a good solution).

How dare you kill low sec
---
It's part of my CSM bid. We were brainstorming on these ideas in Bombers Bar since 4 years ago.
---
Bombing
---
Bombing is one of the rare anti n+1 mechanics in the game. While people at the receiving end might think they didn’t deserve dying suddenly, conducting a bombing run takes great skill and prowess. Bombing has sadly fallen out of meta due to capital proliferation and we need to bring it back.Thus I am open to possible versions and combinations of below ideas.
---
- Bigger stealth bombers: Cruiser size bombers with XL Torpedoes. 
---
- Focused damage bombs: Single target anti-capital damage bombs.
---
- Ewar bombs: Webbing, painting, weapon disrupting bombs.
---
Free Exotic Dancers for Everyone (FEDE)
---
Imo kiting is more advanced than brawling, though I would agree an mwd atron is another great choice.

Here is my Opinion to the big Should i try Eve Question
---
About the f2p Modell:
---
If you don't invest in monthly subscription you will end up grinding ingame currency for the monthly subscription (it allows you to use all of the gane mechanics. If you dont pay you dont get full acces to full content but you van buy this acces with ingame currenvy aswell. Problem is it is quite expensive and you will have a lot of game time, at least at the beginning, grinding and doing repetitive stuff)
---
Grinding will make you loose fun and you can earn that ingame isk with less time working in real life. 
---
In Eve fun comes from nit vaeing about money, that is my opinion at least, so you will have the best experience if you just buy your omega state (thats what it is called when you pay for the full content) and use your ingame earnings for the ingame costs like spaceships and this stuff. 
---
Plus if you want to spend extra real cash you can sell it for ingame currency (indirekt via a concept named PLEX. You buy PLEX for money and can sell PLEX for ingame currency, that is called ISK btw.) and buy even more space ships. 
---
This concerning the free to play model
---
I do not want to say you can't enjoy the f2p model. As a start i would even recommend it. But if you want to stick to the game after a while, there is a chance you will find yourselfe in the situation i described above. 
---
This is a purely subjective opinion. This was the way i experienced eve 
---
For the gameplay part: 
---
It is fucking awesome. I dont want to go into detail, there are a lot of guides written and i think it is even begter when you just log into the game without knowing shit for the first time. 
---
Just three advices. 1. It is a sandbox game, so du whatever you want and try out dicferent things, 2. It is a multiplayer game. As sandbox there is no deep story. Yeah there is lore and shit but tue core mechanics are that you and the other player build a big community and form this universe together. Eve is really about communicating with other players and the community is very newbie friendly. 3. Dont let Eve become an obsession. It can really fast happen that eve consumes a big part of your time, and thats when it stops making fun after a while. 
---
My last Advice is get into pvp as soon as possible. That's where the real fun is and since after a while you usually dont have to worry about ISK that much (if you  play for a longer time you will have an overflow) you can lose. Its fun to blow up spaceships and it can be fun to get blown up. 
---
Here too it is about finding people to play with (Eve has a guild system of course and you will find enough mates) cause the real fun lies in grouping up together and go blow up some expensive big ships etc. 
---
You dont have to main pvp. But in my opinion everyone could have fun in pvp from time to time if they would only try. 
---
If you find full fullfillment in trading or some of the many other stuffs in eve thats fine too though. 
---
Again its only a very subjective opinion. 
---
All in all: yes you should give Eve a try. And there is a good chance Eve will not leave your life ever again, even if you stop playing it. ( You will understand me when you have your first Eve quit post on reddit and log back in after a couple of months) 
---
Fly safe O7
---
Excavator booshing relies on the fact that many Rorqual pilots are AFK or otherwise not paying attention.  If local was the end-all to sneaky activities like you argue it is and pilots were paying attention, you wouldn't have been able to boosh 2T worth of drones.
---
Your desired changes to local and intent to spread out Rorqs while punching holes in umbrella capabilities all are changes that make your preferred play-style even easier.
---
The fuel thing means everyone in J space needs to haul fuel in for their ships now too.  That's unworkable as well.
---
Certainly better than the Horde variety.
---
O7 symbolizes a saluting dude and is used as greeting in Eve
---
Oh look, the weekly "LOOK AT ME, I'M RELEVANT" post from Olmeca Bronze.
---
I think Abyss is not bad in that regard. Perhaps all lucrative PvE should be more like Abyss. Except the risk of dying to players should still be there, so perhaps non-instanced is good.
---
Not getting laughed out of the room is goal 1
---
I'm not validating it. Behavior like this is why I don't admit to other adults that I'm a gamer. 
---
But the question is if this is normal here and any answer but "yes" would be disingenuous at best.
---
it's no contest, you are.
---
I raised it in isolation, a few times in previous BB fleets. As well as other platforms.
---
I'm pretty passionate about countering titan blobs. I've got several high sp titan capable pilots but refuse to engage in the titan circlejerks.
---
I think another role that could be looked at is a cyno bridging battleship. Non cloaky, shorter range, minimal defences. Perhaps fuel usage bonuses.
---
What? Timmy fell down a well!?
---
Goon ballot not released, but no, you are not on it.
---
&gt; lower truesec would be more precious and worthy to be taken again
---
Systems with lower truesec are the only systems worth taking right now. That's what my question was about. Systems below i think its -0.83 are significantly more valuable than the rest and systems above i think -0.4 are worth very little, especially with the recent nerf to rally point respawns.
---
It's not racist to point out that Chinese culture places a large emphasis on winning, and that this translates into botting
---
Tech didn't have its distribution changed much. They rebalanced the reaction mix that consumes goo to make it less of a critical bottleneck.
---
Most playstyles in Eve are emergent and unintended. Some of these are more legitimate and some less. For example, CCP never intended titans to be anom ratting/mainline fleet ships. And I don't see a huge value in this playstyle for the rest of the game. Meanwhile, wormhole life is completely emergent and a huge value to the game.
---
Depending on their value, legit emergent playstyles deserve as much maintanence and love as intended playstyles. I would never say to wormholers things like, for example, "you aren't getting the HIC mass reduction module because CCP never intended wormholes to be lived inside".
---
My own Excavator booshing is rather emergent. I might suffer "collateral damage" if CCP decides to do something about boosh Ravens. So I know the worries first hand.
---
I mean that's how things were for like 80% of EVE's history...
---
I mean, that was the intent with mobile depots.
---
I think you do not understand the basic cultural difference between actually undocking pilots and reddit PvPers like you...
---
Do you want to see more NPSI groups like Bombers Bar and what are your thoughts on Bombers Bar cutting down on SRP and giving more ISK to FC and hunters?
---
I agree with all your thoughts on improvement but recognize a few shortcomings:
---
For my play style and clearly your's, more explosions make the game more fun and stable.  All of your suggestions center around the idea of this cycle of creation/destruction.  However, most people who play Eve by the numbers are not interested in that at all; they play to accumulate, collect, build and socialize.  I recognize that we are in the minority and making plans to up build our play style is better for us only.  In order for Eve to go to the next level in terms of activity, it needs to be more things to more people in the manner they prefer; in that context, I do not want to add explosions, I want to create more sandboxes.
---
I would advocate for a small (much smaller) high-sec that had no pvp with learning only and market hub.  More risk would be added to the movement to/from market hub. Ganking in this area would be banned but encouraged in other areas, perhaps design gank hulls with ganking characteristics.  In low, I would add a lot more isk creation opportunities and make it the most profitable part of Eve as well as much bigger.  This would motivate all to mingle in complex and unpredictable ways. In null, I would keep things as they are and create more structures for players to build by type with many more niches (build the feeling of being in a city).
---
- It could be an attempt to memefy my candidacy.
---
- It could be their way of saying "we'd rather have Olmeca on CSM than other rival candidates because he's an idiot" (adding me to 10th spot means I wouldn't steal a spot from a Goon candidate due to Goon votes).
---
Regardless, I hope to work with other GSM members in a civilized manner. Goons need "punching bag" personalities to unite against. But I sure as hell am tired of being their punching bag on Eve related media.
---
I guess so, but I’ve been in EVE for not quite a year. In many ways I’m a new player still. But because I joined in with a group I was taught how to make isk and quickly was able to inject if I wanted and get into Doctrine ships and be involved. With 5mill skill points and 0 alts I was in Nestor fleets running C5 sites and making decent money. I think everyone has the ability to make the isk. Nobody has to stay in HS but if they choose to that’s on them. It’s more a problem of us as players not helping new players enough more than the game becoming easier everywhere
---
It means surrender. You are doomed.

If you could pick any player currently playing to be on the CSM other than you, who would it be?
---
It 100% is.
---
Having more NPC Null is directly on my CSM bid.
---
Another thing is fixing the bubble/NPC interaction. People can completely blocking station undocks (to those who don't have standings) by bubbling them and making NPCs stuck. I argue for a more dangerous Eve. And these are hubs guerilla-warfare people use to make nullsec more dangerous. Shouldn't be that easy to prevent their use, particularly by entities with huge supercap forces.

Fix FW reward system remove neutral citadels and access lists from FW space and focus tutorials towards faction warfare as the default newplayer activity instead of mining.
---
Apples and oranges amigo. But nice try.
---
This was my picture taken at Fanfest. I do not have t-shirts like that.
---
Christ, I never said horde was elites, horde is their brave/karmafleet/brandnewbro meatshield branch. Out of which they pick the odd elite player from (the ones that get titans and shit). 
---
deadco is fighting panfam, currently, not paying attention? deadco wiped a region of TCUs in a day or two. 
---
So no matter how shit deadco supposedly is, a reason to keep deadco on the panfam side even in spite of said 40 fortizar shit, would be so that deadco don't fight panfam.
---
It's not unworkable if it's easy to devote 24 m3(or twelve new fuel type different m3, fuel bay is merely 6m3 or whatever) of space in your cargo bay to it, like I said needs to be carefully examined if anyone even deemed to read my words in regards to it. Without collateral damage too please if anyone reads the most important plea of it.
---
I like your thought process, but I disagree with you on the increase reward in nullsec. Is nullsec not already abundantly wealthy in respect to farm able anoms, faction spawns, and more valuable mining assets?  Were as, a besieged site (most difficult lowsec anom) is usually almost worthless and uncheesable.  A lot of people I know in low sec (as a resident myself) stay in low sec due to the higher risk. It just feels like eve truly has not delivered on their promises.
---
what fix do you propose? they already ref the city you agro them with, do you want drifter weapons to bypass reinforcement timers?

It's "easy" when you don't live in J space and don't understand how critical, how difficult, and how dangerous logistics can be.  Now I need to bring in a new type of fuel for every cloaky ship? What if I don't get a good chain for a week?

I am completely bamboozled as to why you would reply to my comment with this comment.

I would love nothing more than massive sov displacement and fighting over limited resources.

Which is why the market needs an overhaul. You've explained exactly how the system is not supposed to work. It took wars a long time, I'm sure CCP will fix the market eventually.
---
I like this. Build them to be anti-tackle.

That's because they are all bots.

If you think they're good, vote for them. Don't wait for someone else to tell you it's ok to do so. I'm all for voting lists as suggestions, but they aren't (or shouldn't be) orders that you have to obey in detail.

No, I declared there's a fundamental flaw with the market. That was pretty obvious.

Some of them even had lore that you couldn't find anywhere else. The Prima guide for Prototype had the backstory on Alex Mercer, Blackwatch, and the viruses that you couldn't find in-game.
---
You want players? just turn eve into world of warcraft. Add a XP bar and respawns for lost ships etc. Basically look up SWGs NPE and take some notes. Dig out walking in stations and add a lobby with other players and some dance emotes. 
---
daily fuckin quests
---
Just bought a copy. Looking forward to reading it.
---
I don't see how this is useful. First of all you assume unfitted ships which makes very little sense as that's generally not what you'll be shooting at. Secondly you don't account for HP numbers for shield and armor. only knowing the resists for shield and armor without knowing how much HP each has is meaningless.
---
Most importantly, this feature is implemented in Pyfa where you CAN use fitted ships and then apply damage types or even npc faction damage types to it.
---
As a tip for anyone using this site, if you are doing PVP always aim for the second lowest resist; people usually plugs the resists hole, but rarely does it with the second (the exception would be heavy tackle or bait ships that favour tank over damage or ewar, or ratters that tank local rats damage types).
---
PL invaded, Provi fought back for awhile but got evicted. Before the faction forts were spawned TEST kicked out PL and took the forts for themselves instead.
---
just put it on a random timer.   aka anywhere from 20-40 days from the time the last one respawned.  same with despawn timer.  anywhere from 20-40 days.  
---
and as far as lore, there are countless reasons why certain materials may be discovered in a certain region.  for example, make them biologics that come together to mate.  or out of control growth of some sort of bacteria. 
---
turn it into some sort of fuel block mechanism for cits or logistics so that the big blocks absolutely need it, while the small groups can get away without ignoring it.
---
It weighs 1 m3 or less, only one type of fuel required for cynos. Use LO ice and add it to the refine table, or maybe give mercoxit another purpose, that way it can least be found in whs some of the time(not often tho I'm aware), also make it drop fat amounts so it's cheap. 
---
 And this man may be noone but it's quite rude how you assumed I don't "know", next time lead off the Civil accusation with"im not sure if you're aware but these things are this difficult for X reasons" rather than just jumping to the conclusion that I know nothing about what I speak of, I know it's reddit and all but, OprahShrug.meme
---
Thank you for your response and criticismsss :)
---
Didn't know market pvp existed. If it did,  I would never admit to that being my mastering tactic of Eve. You just called yourself the biggest carebear of all.
---
Hi Parts!
---
I believe that the greater preponderance of NPC regions, especially regions rich in stations, in the south is a significant factor in the historically greater level of conflict compared to the north of the map. 
---
IMO the north badly needs a region like Curse - large, with fairly easy empire access and loads of NPC stations, plus enough NPC agents to provide a basic living for the inhabitants. Regions like these are like the coastal marshes and mangrove swamps next to the open ocean - they provide a relatively safe environment for small young groups to spawn and grow, and a 0.0 based fallback position for older entities to fall back and regroup in.
---
What can you do better than the current CSM members? and there for put you as the no.1 on our ballet list.
---
And more than anything I'm not saying knee jerk add this to the game, people far more versed than reddit armchair generals should test, review internally and maybe even wait and watch for vocal responses to even having the idea in the first place. Before it's even thought of being implemented, too many times changes are either made or proposed without any thoughts to the other styles of Gameplay, regular lifestyles that rely on this thing that they want changed and etc. I think by no means want that just because I feel I should be forced to drag *FakeCloakFueltype* to my small fuel bay every several hours
---
Man it's been 1 jump way from 2 different invasion locations so far, watched as a autopilot or a got eaten on the perimeter -&gt; jita gate on the first one
---
If you don't mind explaining further, what is the tactic being exploited by a fleet comp like this? I'm guessing the idea is to be able to blink the entire mass multiple times in succession during a fight, but why/to what end?
---
You sound like a troll. Posting nothing of relevance, but a failed attempt to hide your own pathetic life. Crying your incel self to sleep at night. I think I win.
---
So to use supers you have to gate a titan or super with your fleet? Yeah ok.
---
&gt;Bombing has sadly fallen out of meta due to capital proliferation
---
Um. no? Literally half the fleets I go in are bomber-based or bomber heavy. They're in regular use.
---
How about specialize skills more so if you train engineering skills you get a engineering injector, this will then lead you to well inject only engineering skills. 
---
This would mean that at the very least skill farms would be less generic and some skills that where not important a month ago would go up and down in value rather then the statically rising price of "SP"
---
They could certainly be nerfed. Simply disabling the extraction of any skill more than once would go a long way towards that.
---

My thoughts are that these two statements seem to be at odds, "members like this aren't representative of the culture in PH" while you "wish I could say I am surprised, but I am not... anyone who isn't blacklisted is guaranteed entry into PH." 
---
In other words, you are saying its not the norm, while also saying you let anyone in and you are not surprised. See, if it was not at least *a norm* and *a normal occurrence,* you would be surprised.
---
RIP snuffed box

'unfair' pvp haha seriously you need to stop trying to play on the market you are grossly unprepared
---
reason to come back
---
it's the best version of eve
---
The horrors of playing an MMO... almost like you need other people to maximize your isk generation.
---
Burning down a random thing here and there for the lulz and systematically burning down huge swaths of highly defensible structures by coordinating powerful fleets at specific times over the course of several days (again, for very little in the way of reward) are two very different things.
---
You're looking for something that isn't there.
---
Could the sov map be changed so that the coloring only covers systems and not empty space, also, I don’t think the colors should touch unless the two alliances share a border, and even then only at the point they share a border
---
you can also drop an mtu on the gate and send drones to pop box
---
How many are real new players.
---
Flower fallen your videos are always fantastic. Don't let scum like this keep you down, the stuff you make is amazing!
---
When you right click info on WH in space the information box will say Unknown wormhole. Apart from unknown you have dangerous and deadly. Those two only have combat sites and other wormholes. They tend to have like 15-40 signatures or something, so most ppl will avoid them; thats why they are good for finding dead end WHs that will have non combat relic sites in them :)
---
How? It already exists in a majority of places and activities. Incursions, Abyssals, Mining/ratting anomalies, wormholes, faction warfare, missions, and I’m pretty sure exploration has a spread of lower and higher-end content. 
---
Getting more people moving around and out in space interacting with the world doesn’t seem anti-EVE at all to me.
---
Olmeca, I am going to vote for you because *there is no way* you do not get yourself banned if you are elected to the CSM, and I expect your meltdown to be epic.

*rifters

---
&gt; Why would they want to help PanFam ever again?
---
Ever again is a long time. 
---
You know goons have evicted test atleast two times right? 🤔
---
I am just applying the logic and the meaning of words to the statement that was made. 
---
"This isn't normal, you won't find this here" combined with "well I am totally not surprised, this is what we get when we let anyone in the alliance and do not vet anyone" do not match. In fact they communicate opposite things.
---
I was in a group in wh space not active enough to make it fun. Ended up alone in a wormhole alot with no hole rolling help or alot to do on your own.
---
&gt; do you have some idea to bring new player into Eve ?
---
More wars. More stories. More emergence. Those have always been biggest attractors of new players to Eve. The game needs balance for them to keep happening.
---
&gt; what you think about Plex, Skill injector/farm and TZ tanking?
---
Constant SP pump to the game (also CCP's rewards) is one of the root causes of capital proliferation. But I don't think CCP can take injectors back now. And I don't know how else they can balance them. Perhaps balancing capitals will help, as capital alts are where a lot of the SP goes. It also puts pressure to PLEX prices, but I think manipulation is a bigger issue with PLEX.
---
&gt; do you think making everything drop when we kill something a good idea to let the pvper farm their ISK with pvp?
---
No. Destruction of modules is a healthy part of Eve's economy.
---
This would just cause every legitimate local fight to turn into batphone via wormhole even more so than it currently is.  The problem with wormholes in nullsec is that it stops the control of space lanes and prevents people from dying to things like gate camps. Before wormholes, the only way to timely get to catch was through HED-GP, Curse Alliance and Stain Alliance would skirmish daily to control the HED-GP to U-QVWD pipeline. It created around the clock content to enable the movement of goods and materials. Some of this was mitigated by jump freighters, but the point remains that the more wormholes available, the less the geography of the game matters. 
---
I've been playing since 2003, and I still believe that wormholes should only connect to low sec, not to create safety for people in null, but to enforce the geographical constraints of being deep in a wasteland and make control over your spacelanes matter.
---
This is where we strongly disagree. You've in fact changed the words I've used to suit an agenda.
---
Good day.
---
Idea: Make them the slower aligning but slightly more powerful nullified interceptor.
---
+500% stratios wormhole activation limit, -500% for all other ship types
---
olmeca 2nd place on goon ballot c/d?
---
level 3/4 missions require skills and a ship. Escalations require significant skills. Exploration in null and huffing are some of the only thing to do. Level 4s pay okay once you get going in them, but that takes time.
---
Realistically, every newbro I mentor gets the same advice. You can ninja huff, or you can run sansha/br relic sites, then you train skills towards pvp ships and make isk doing the above, ratting, trading, abyssals, etc once you have some skills.
---
The problem is, the newbros who don't have mentors, and begin in hisec. They can daytrip for explo or huff gas. They can grind to get l4s and such, but most of them quit before that.
---
Also, go to null and see how many people undock small gangs without a ping anymore. My corp is one of the few that fuckin DOES.
---
NPSI always has a special place for me. I'd want more NPSIs only in cases which there is no NPSI activity in a niche. WH ragerolling (for WH systems) is one, hisec ganking is one. I wouldn't necessarily want more NPSIs doing the same activities, splitting the community. I'd want people coming together, organizing and structuring themselves. More FCs and more people participating in it.
---
&gt; thoughts on Bombers Bar cutting down on SRP and giving more ISK to FC and hunters?
---
I always argued for 100% SRP in BB. I'd have thought they'd have enough money for both. If not, I'd have prioritized SRP.
---
I know exactly who you are and you're REALLY not a good example of the quality of the NPE bro, but I'm glad you settled in well after I left. :)
---

Having 20 titans smartbomb their 20 man gang then 3 days later 20 titans smartbomb their 13 man gang then we act proud when only 4 people join 3 days after that.  When the sigs were deployed we would get fights, but USTZ is totally dead and unfun for both sides now.
---
&gt;Adaptive anomaly respawns  
---
&gt;: This basically makes respawns in one null system a factor of how much farm is being done in the entire nullsec. If implemented nicely, this would limit the amount of farm an alliance can provide under a single supercap umbrella, yet leave room for small entities to carve in nullsec (and even give motivation to large alliances to let small alliances be).
---
Why not region-wise instead of all of nullsec?
---
What videos m8? You stopped posting them as soon as you got elected.

The CSM is a gigantic wate of time and never achieved anything worthwhile. Am I wrong?
---
Capitals online greatly damaged the solo blops playstyle. I talk about this a little bit in my video. I don't know how to bring that meta back.
---
[One](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/amgj7y/capital_projectioncynojump_drive_balance_three/) of my proposals is giving BLOPS battleships an active module that shuts down active cynoes. Perhaps it would be a motivation to see blops battleships on grid instead of merely bridging.

Sansha AB bonus on combat ceptors plz
---
Do you have an opinion or idea to make other playstyles more effective, especially in Null?

Right now, it seems the only way to 'progress' is turtle up, rorq away, and spam the caps. Only this style of gameplay provides the biggest long term reward, safety, security and supremacy.

&gt;The most upvoted comment that actually tries to answer the question doesn't list a single thing that would draw new players to the game,
---
Unfortunately Eve is old enough and infamous for enough that it would be extremely hard to draw in truely new players.  That said by now millions of people have stopped playing Eve that could be drawn back
---
1) I would do a better job in representing many playstyles other than empire building. Which is why lots of people from playstyles like NPSI, whaling, bombing, wormholes, lowsec etc. support me currently anyway.
---
2) I think I have a better grasp on greater picture issues of Eve ecosystem. The mega empire people in CSM are either empire builders who barely undock, or are FCs who mainly do sov warfare. The first type is ignorant to negative effects of CCPs constant catering to their playstyle. The second type has command in many issues (fleet vs fleet warfare and ship balance, sov capture mechanics, war mechanics). But neither type is aware of the importance of whaling and everyday risk/reward mechanics in determining the meta. 
---
In other words, we are currently seeing Goons capturing north sov. Talking about specific issues there like TZ tanking and specific mechanics. But none of us talk about what happened in the first place, so one side obtained twice the titans compared to the rest of Eve, and has the ability to replace them 3 times faster? In those conditions, nobody will willingly resist to such invasion and engage in a serious (titan) fight. If those conditions persist, the lack of serious fights will persist. And those conditions were exactly whaling and umbrella mechanics. The majority of people don't join alliances because their war machine or propaganda is succesful. They join to acquire assets and get rich as safe as possible. And that safety is a matter of how big your umbrella is, and how effective it is, etc.
---
&gt;Escalations require significant skills
---
They really don't, a cruiser can do them, are you thinking incursions?

I don't care who undocks for what, I'm always undocked, where I am there is usually no place for me to dock, that's your problem if people don't want to get out  without permission.

---
Make a cool video about the loser show what he did
---
Wormholer perspective here: Prior to the introduction of "low power" mode, it was extremely difficult to tell whether a wormhole was inhabited or abandoned, excluding a few wormholes owned by active PVP groups. Each abandoned wormhole with structures left sitting around was another system not providing content to anyone, since few groups would be willing to day-trip into such a wormhole for PVE and few groups would be willing to move into such a wormhole for PVE. Signalling the emptiness of certain systems encouraged new groups to enter the ecosystem, because they could now (mostly) tell the difference between abandoned systems and actively in use systems.
---
In nullsec, from what I've seen, many actively used structures are left in low power mode. To me, this suggests that the penalties of low power mode are not sufficiently punishing. I would agree, tentatively, that the proliferation of *in use* structures is not a problem. But I would strongly contest that the proliferation of space debris which looks like actively used structures is not. I believed high power and low power modes were supposed to be this dividing line, but it doesn't appear to be working.
---
You telling everyone what to think and what to do is unacceptable behavior in my opinion too. But I am not creating public service announcements about that on reddit, since I am less inclined to try my hardest to change public opinion on a matter that is close to my heart.
---
Please stop bullying people into being outraged.
---
The keepstar radius is huge. So you can reposition very quickly and across pretty large distances to evade defending fleets, but still be able to apply damage to the structure.

&gt;GOTG (as dumb as that name is its still better than whatever the mongrel dogs in the coalition are coming up with) betrayed Panfam? They literally negotiated a deal that covered only them last year and not the rest of the Northern alliances, claiming they had been brutally camped for months (despite the fact this was happening everywhere.)
---
NCdot, PL and horde was covered for 1 month completely free from cloaky camping, but for example horde said "no thank you" so we could cloaky camp horde from day 1 after deal was made. 
---
6 months for deadco (a named dreamt up by themselves not imperium), and 1 month for everyone else. 
---
You have drunk the cool-aid my friend. Imperium had a HUGE advantage against deadco in deadco's prime timezone, and that timezone was outside most of panfam's main timezones. So we shat on deadco with cloaky camping for months leading up to the war. WAAAAY more so than our attacks on other groups in the north, we gated dreads through deklein at some point because we had such overwhelming advantage against deadco when their morale had dropped far enough. Every time a deadco member would log on to do some ratting or form a roam or something, before the official war, we were there with enough people to shit on them. At peak cloaky camping we had more imperium people in deklein than deadco had. 
---
Then we shat on deadco in every titan fight, and most subcap fights outside of deadco prime time, and we harassed their structures and dropped on freighters and fuelers and bumped random people who were tethered and bubblefucked their space and sov-wanded at random times and multiboxers even reffed structures with VNIs so that the already burnt out deadco had to respond to prevent them losing 60 day fracks of R64 moons (they even tried to mine the valuable ore with barges because they couldn't fly anything else without us instantly turbofucking them with 150+ bombers). By the time the war officially started deadco was on the ropes. 
---
It would've been silly to run our pilots so hard that we managed to bring ALL the panfam groups to the ropes like we did with deadco, then we would've burnt out before the official war started (or in the middle of the official war). 
---
And low and behold it worked, the so-called ***allies*** of deadco didn't see how much we shat on deadco and so the ***allies*** made deadco their enemy on the rationale that "deadco don't show up with enough numbers for fights and don't contribute many titans and complain too much". And then on top of that the ***allies*** went "the war with imperium is over, lets shit on deadco now for fun fights". Horde and BL literally shat on deadco on the tail end of 8 months of imperium attacks. 
---
It was glorious when BL and horde declared their intention to continue our efforts. 
---
I wish I could say I knew we planned it that way but I think we just had deadco on our shitlist in the second place after CO2.
---
&gt; most people who play Eve by the numbers are not interested in that at all;
---
I know this. Part of my journey so far has been trying to convince people that they should lose ships during krabbing, for a healthy Eve. Otherwise many other playstyles go down the drain. These people need to accept that Eve is essentially a game that hinges on a risk/reward balance. They can't expect doing high reward activities with no risk. I've seen so many good sports GF'ing in local after losing 3 of their Rorquals to a bomber fleet of 150. They appreciate that their death was a reason for 150 people to play for the night. 3-4 fights like that in a month, and these people keep subbing and paying CCP money. The good sports understand their value in this kind of ecosystem. There is no reason for others to not appreciate the same thing.
---
&gt; I would advocate for a small (much smaller) high-sec that had no pvp with learning only and market hub. 
---
Why not. As I said, Eve is a risk/reward game. There needs to be high risk/high reward places, and low risk/low reward places.
---
TEST and Panfam fought, but let's get one thing right  --&gt; TEST was never backstabbed, the issue was with Co2, TEST had a choice and they chose to go with CO2, there was no backstab, everyone knew people would go neutral after the war and that's exactly what happened. 
---
Cut with your victim complex already.
---
Things better hurry the fuck up and escalate.  So far this event has been a dull, boring mess with no rewards, and feels half finished at best in pure CCP fashion.  Considering how much they've hyped it up with streaming of boring ass phase 1, I wouldn't get my hopes up on it not sucking.
---
This is also my theory... cause #justccpthings
---
Yeh but one of the things stopping nullsec corps just blobbing WH corps is the WH. 
---
If a nullsec corp wants to blob a WH group they have to go subcaps, which leaves the WHers able to field capital support.
---
With the suggestion Null corps could take 5-10 caps into a hole with a support fleet, nullifying any home field advantage. 
---
And if it was a static then if they crash it np just scan down the new one.
---
It tips the balance of power more into the larger group, and enforces N+1.
---
I think your analysis of the status quo is right on.
---
My ideas are in [the forum thread](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/the-whaler-an-eve-documentary-also-olmeca-gold-for-csm/161711).
---
- "Adaptive anomaly respawns" would balance the "turtle", by limiting the population you can fit under the same umbrella. It would also bring selective recruiting back, because everyone would want the best people to cooperate with, under their own umbrella.
---
- "Asset safety rework" would offer incentives to not to turtle all the time, and go kill others' stuff.
---
- "Cyno inhibation revamp" would nerf the turtling by limiting the ability to make your space ultra safe by merely spamming more capitals. Same goes with the "New Wormholes with Nullsec Statics" , " More NPC Stations in Nullsec", "New Local Delayed Ship Class" ideas.
---
- Ideas under "Bombing" would introduce new counters to the spammed capitals.

Why did Dopamine left VOLTA?
---
With the knowledge that the gate is open, and with an overloaded MWD ready to go before entering the rift, you _should_ be ok.
---
I didn't have this knowledge, and I had killed this room before, so that is what I thought I had to do.
---
Now I know the gate is open.
---
Now I know the Neut range on those BS.
---
Now I can try again.
---
That would mean if a region is overly farmed, it would spawn even more anomalies. It's the opposite of what I want to achieve (to spread out economic activity in null).
---
The actual answer to this is due to shitty leadership panfam have fucked over /backstabbed or flexed on because they are smaller most of entity's in the game and have very little bridges unburnt to get help from
---
always min max mining all the way
---
Son? Son?!
---
 I've been playing since 2006.
---
I'm your daddy.
---
So a couple things: loved that video. Based on that and what I've seen of your platform, you're going to be somewhere on my ballot near the top.  
---
That said, I see a lot of people in here talking about prioritizing the issues with FW/Lowsec above those in Null. Obviously, I'm biased in favor of that argument, but I also agree that with some effort, there's no reason why CCP can't get both done. 
---
My main issue is that I am afraid that, once again, the FW candidate(s) will get shut out of the CSM because we simply don't have the numbers to vote them in. 
---
Given that FW/LS desperately need a re-work and that it seems as though CCP is saying that they may be doing said re-work this year, would you support a kind of "Gentleman's Agreement" between the Null Blocs (and/or any entity in the game with a ballot) to place one FW candidate high enough on said ballot so that we get at least some say in how our area of the game is "fixed." 
---
As ridiculous as that sounds, it's the only way I see us getting someone in, and yet it has never been more important for us to have someone on the CSM.
---
you underestimate the number of capitals wormholes generally contain
---
I can't tell you how excited I'd be go find 10 nulltard dreads in a wormhole trying to scan sigs and read the wiki to figure out how they're getting home
---
You would have wormhole systems with massive NS statics and standard sized other wormholes (e.g. their wh-to-wh or roaming knownsec connections would be standard sized).
---
So you wouldn't have capital corridors thru wormholes. The only way for me to come to your aid using these wormholes would be rolling them. And even if I rolled the right one, with the mass I am proposing it would support 10-15 dreads/carriers in and out. That's not a game changer considering the size of capital fights in null.
---
m-o keepstar is in final reinforce, https://zkillboard.com/kills/citadels/ 100+b of citadels were killed last night in tribute. Every single PL/NC ihub in tenal is now dead and renters are moving to malpais and selling structures to DeadCo.
---
They are precious now because they will infinitely respawn the _right_ sites as opposed to infinitely respawning sites no one wants. I think what /u/Olmeca_Gold is suggesting is that they will be precious because they are more likely to spawn the sites you want, hence you have to leave them less often to keep bearing.
---
&gt;no, changing fundamental mechanics for a single ship is a terrible idea
---
T2 ships are literally defined by their exceptions to normal mechanics. They all have a specialised 'superpower'. If not scram immunity, then suggest something else? Personally I think it's not a totally unreasonable counterpart to bubble immunity, and would give CIs a feature that distinguishes them from AFs.
---
Thats ok eloknight is furiously defending botters at the moment we'd probably get more action that way
---
in current day eve those skirmishes cannot happen. there is, unfortunately, nothing to preserve
---
Has eves universe ever grown? The first several years of eve had a much much smaller player base (or active accounts).
---
good to know - thanks for sharing.
---
na just limit the null blocks to  max 10 systems than you see more ppl in space
---
10-15 dreads in a local fight (not a capital slugfest) would dramatically turn the tide to favor one or the other. You also forget that there are groups in the game, like our pathfinder sig, that can have 20-30 people rolling different holes through wormhole connections at a time out of Delve to connect us with content. You give us a much larger vacuum to find connections with null sec and you'll have fleets in and out of wormholes all day long.
---
For me, I just want to wake up and see what items sold and what profit they made after taxes.  Eve-mogul doesn't have this, or else it's well hidden.
---
This sounds to me more like a nuisance for SP farmers rather than an actual solution. The limit of extractable skills would still be over 100m. They'd only need to train more prerequisite skills (e.g. Battleship III for Carrier etc.)
---
GESI is a plug in for google spreadsheets with prebuilt functions. Have to figure out how to make it work for yourself though
---
Harden the fuck up.
---
You need to go back and look at eve history the blue donut is not new and its not only happened on the Chinese server
---
There would be a particular market for each skill area and eventually they would all hit an equilibrium where 500m skill equals the same in each. This would create market pvp opportunities like cornering a particular skill area market, but it wouldn't address the main issues with SP farming.
---
Just go Old School and play it backwards for the Satanic messages.
---
&gt;watching, but the item is popular enough that i cant stay lowest/highest order for long.its not always bots.
---
Deep undercutting and driving people out of the market works, if you're dedicated enough.
---
Thanks for fleet joe - good choice in music
---
Depends on the size of the corp.
---
Its not just 10 nulltard dreads. Its those dreads AND a massive support fleet that could easily get through that hole.
---
Make an alt in his corp, backstab him, meme video wingspan style, profit.
---
I specifically meant damage bomb runs there, not bombers. I appreciate the innovation in stuka fleets. Should have been more explicit.
---
Because your specific doctrine is bombers, you can have damage bombs and try to use them. That doesn't change the fact that the a lesser amount of nullsec fights are done in bombable ships, plus defenders make it easy to defend if you have a bombable doctrine.
---
This would completely obliterate mineral trading volumes.
---
You can fly how you want in PH, you can smell gang with mates, you can solo or you can join the big strat oo fleets. There are no demands or requirements, that's the beauty of it.
---
I would include many playstyles, some of which I already played (NPSI, whaling, bombing, lowsec/FW, wormholes). I haven't done too much hisec, which means I don't have too much of my own ideas and a made up mind about it. But I aim to represent all underrepresented playstyles to the best of your ability. Which means if people gave me feedback from hisec, I wouldn't ignore.
---
&gt;You have drunk the cool-aid my friend.
---
Really? Cause only one of us slammed out 2k characters of shit here.
---
&gt;And low and behold it worked, the so-called allies of deadco didn't see how much we shat on deadco and so the allies made deadco their enemy on the rationale that "deadco don't show up with enough numbers for fights and don't contribute many titans and complain too much". And then on top of that the allies went "the war with imperium is over, lets shit on deadco now for fun fights". Horde and BL literally shat on deadco on the tail end of 8 months of imperium attacks.
---
Oh please, the egoism of GOTG leadership is what got them into that position in the first place. It was their **CHOICE** to sprawl across 4 of the most decentralized regions in the game in 2017/2018 rather than compressing into a single region for defensive purposes, it was their **CHOICE** not to retreat or ball up further because it was their **CHOICE** that their fertile krablands in Branch and Deklein were far more important to them than actual planning.
---
Anyone with a few brain cells rattling around in their skulls could have seen what kind of position they were in, but GOTG leadership was too prideful to give up Deklein and Branch and coalesce into a smaller, less plentiful region because muh ticks, muh rocks, muh moonsssss.
---
&gt;PS: TEST was allied with panfam THEN panfam decided to kick TEST from the north some time after the casino war. The reason why TEST say they've been attacked a lot is because they've been attacked a lot. I guess we'll see in five years if panfam complains about being beaten up every year. Or if they suck it up and don't play the victim card.
---
TEST plays its victim card when it bests suits them. Considering how the CFC tried to annihilate them in Fountain, then in their retreat to Delve, Curse, and to FW for a stint and yet they can ally with them freely now does not show that they give a shit about who attacks them as long as it is convenient for them to partner with those who are against the most recent group to beat them up. Prior to joining Origin., I've been a part of a whole host of coalitions that were shitwrecked again and again, and yet even TEST manages to surpass my bellyaching with their victimhood complex which burns brighter than the sun on any given day.
---
Let's talk about how apparently **SURPRISING** it is for anyone who has played this game past the tutorial stage that PL and NC would haze a group living next to them if they felt like it, and how that group is **SHOCKED** that this occurs despite the longstanding history. If any TEST line members ever thought that a post-WWB MBC new world order of NIPs and NAPs was ever going to be a reality, they were mistaken. Sitting around a singing kumbaya forever and ever may be enough for the 1,000,000,000 j4gs in the CFC right now, but it isn't for everyone else.
---
fuck, I like TEST again.
---
No, but one could assume Paquito probably sent that mail out after dropping a biscuit in his tea again.
---
how can someone afk affect your gameplay
---
they are not. you are choosing to let the threat of danger affect your decision-making.
---
the ark camper does not gank your vni
---
Thats why we do a fleet. :D
---
&gt; A total of 13 rorquals were destroyed in addition to the Hel supercarrier, bringing the total isk lost for the engagement to over [100B ISK](https://br.inyour.space/?s=4714&amp;b=8632470&amp;e=120&amp;t=b) by dumb pilot in goonswarm who obviously won't get anything from the SRP wallet, so it doesn't really affect the imperium. But it does pad the killboard of certain people who care about such things. 
---
FIFY :P
---
Yeah they added entire regions in the early years, I know Black Rise is one example.
---
HTFU. If you don't like what someone is saying block them. It's a video game, go find your rl safe space somewhere else.
---
It's not bullying to tell someone they're wrong when they are clearly wrong. This isn't some gray area. Its pretty much universally agreed upon that this type of behavior is toxic. I don't think you're deliberately trying to support this idiot but the complacency you and many others adhear to is a major factor in enabling people like this.
---
The fact that you treat me as some militant radicalist just for saying the we shouldn't perpetuate the narrative that this is ok is absurd. It seems you just want to defend a culture of complacency at all costs. Which leads me to wonder what you have to gain from our community remaining this way. Suspiscious AF bro.
---
The C6 idea is simply giving classic null statics to many C6s. It's a less desirable solution, but it'd be a good step.
---
&gt;Bombing has sadly fallen out of meta
---
[Says you.](https://youtu.be/odio3cF_RyI)
---
Other than that -- sorely mistaken -- remark, I'm with you.
---
Same, if I were rich I'd throw all the money at them to add in these features
---
PH is allied with FRT against the botting menace of TAPI who supported some of the worst betters in the game (KWG) for a long time. So if people want to join a truly anti botting alliance join PH. Nice try on the spin though.
---
Well, this explains the "play other games until pinged" mentality I keep reading about.
---
You realize that you can block them, right? "But I shouldn't have to!" Just shut up.
---
&gt; Christ, I never said horde was elites, horde is their brave/karmafleet/brandnewbro meatshield branch. Out of which they pick the odd elite player from (the ones that get titans and shit).
---
People don’t “get picked” from Horde any more than PL/NC. “picks” from goons or test, or vice versa. Just because Horde is newbro friendly doesn’t mean there aren’t literally hundreds of dudes with 60m+ SP and years of playing.
---
&gt; deadco is fighting panfam, currently, not paying attention? deadco wiped a region of TCUs in a day or two.
---
No because literally nobody cares. They “wiped” it because it was entirely uncontested. If anyone had even bothered to actually show up Darkness. would have gone home.
---
&gt; So no matter how shit deadco supposedly is, a reason to keep deadco on the panfam side even in spite of said 40 fortizar shit, would be so that deadco don't fight panfam.
---
There is no deadco. They kicked Slyce out. SBSQ and RR are renters. Sort chose his side over a year ago, why are you droning on about this like somehow it’s something anyone besides Sort has a hand in?
---
Hope you get 15k more downloads! All your content was always fun and i am sorry you stopped (aren’t able to) producing your youtube vids! Imo, seemed like the CSM 1337 gang killed your interest... hope to see you active again, soon (tm)
---
I want them to despawn after some period of time like the other sleepers do so I can't pile them up and kill them at my leisure without undocking.  Force players to bring ships to kill them in site so there is risk involved.
---
&gt;completely obliterate mineral trading 
---
(upvoted)
---
Can you explain why it would do that? Would it not mandate more strategical pricing?
---
Too easy for larger ships to get caught.
---
4) a mix of borderlands and pvpzones from something like daoc, openworld transition zones that you find cool loot/mobs, dont make it a competitive shooter make it diablo loot shooter that when you die you can drop one of the ultra rare specials that you farmed for. Ofc this would never happen.
---
Not really.
---
Firstly, Im not entirely on board with idea that simply pushing up the player to star system ratio is going to improve much. It makes sense on a micro scale, but I don’t think it will have as much positive effects overall as people think. The systemic problem eve has had for long isn’t systems not being used, it’s systems being claimed, *then* not used. I could go on in detail about this a bit more, but to sum it up just imagine what would happen if all the major alliances suddenly dropped half their sob and made no aggressive attempts to expand or claim other systems. Given the right situation, I’m certain plenty of people would be more willing to move out into the wilds.
---
Secondly, it’s going to be a hard sell, and hard to even implement. What systems do you even choose and why? Even if you have a plan for how to construct the space, what’s to say that doesn’t just push more people into big coalitions or out of null entirely? That may lead to the opposite of the desired effect. 
---
I feel the size of the space isn’t as big a part as one might think. If you imagine an extreme example, cut eve down to 5 nullsec region and what would happen? Would megacoalitions go away or reduce in power? Would more people want to come to basically the same bull as before, but now smaller?
---
You are getting his alts and other players mixed up, he doesn’t fly hyps to bait, usually gnosis or praxis
---
In layman’s terms, this isn’t normal because the shitters are dealt with swiftly before they cause a shitstorm. It’s not surprising that someone is being a shitter.
---
none of your proposals are adressing the aids that is citadel warfare with too many citadels, too many timers and lime timezone wars. 
---
You aint getting my vote
---
Defenders aren't a huge problem, most people are too stupid to use them properly. HACs are the problem. 
---
That said, even in the age of Munnins we can still take a dozen bombers and cause some major havoc.
---
I like this, make it more of an FPS RPG and tack on some PVP elements. The main downside is this requires a lot of narrative writing, which isn't really CCP's strong suit.
---
And wormholes too (if that counts)
---
well done, you promoted your channel...
---
Thanks. For a while I was busy streaming, then after that I didn't have a good computer room setup to use for several months. Even now my acoustics are TERRIBLE. Plus I don't like to make content just to make it. But I am playing around with a video idea as we speak...
---
I think null issues are more central to the health of the game. I can't deny that. Particularly, many economic issues arise from nullsec overfarming, affecting everyone; whereas FW issues are isolated to people who play that gameplay.
---
However, I think FW issues are more immediate, in that FW "waited in the line" for years and years. I wouldn't be offended if CCP worked on FW and not the stuff I wanted for null. I would certainly respect that immediecy, and remind CCP of it. I think FW people can in good conscious leave a spot for me in their ballot. Perhaps after candidates like Matthew Dust.
---
Imagine trying to shoot something that disappears and then reappears further away every time you get close. With enough boosh dessies, you can blink 100km, fire at the structure, blink, fire, blink etc. etc. MJD takes 6-7s (I think) with lvl V skills to activate, which basically makes the Boosh Raven faster than any combat ship in the game at 17ish KM/s, and you have to scram them to stop it (aka get within 10KM before they boosh). To top it all off the Ravens are fit for range and can hit out to ridiculous distances...my guess is well over 200km but I've never flown them.
---
Hisec anoms don't need to spawn in nullsec. Newbro nullsec alliances need to spawn campuses in hisec/lowsec again, where low-skilled newbros can find training and level-appropriate content while they train up the necessary skills to actually enjoy their quality of life in nullsec.  It's not nice to bring newbros into nullsec and then recommend a months-long skill queue to fly even basic nullsec ships like interceptors and VNIs.
---
Really good haha! It's one of the perks of being a z-list internet influencer. To this day I still get salty messages from Assassin's Creed players who are angry my videos popularized the use of Hidden Gun in faster game modes, which is generally hated by the rest of the community.
---
Yeah the reality is I just used the default forms in Squarespace, most of it isn't even required fields.
---
It helps that I have both my hands
---
If you need a spreadsheet to tell that you're making money, you're probably doing it wrong
---
Theres no point in reverting fax implementation. You'll have nullbocs jumping in 300 carriers instead of 300faxes.
---
A better approach would be to go the way of HAW/Cap gun dreads.  
---
Reduce the repping application of capital reps to subcaps, but then give FAXs a passive bonus to large rep amount/range.  Large rep fax are for subs, Cap rep fax are for caps.  Trying to rep one with the opposite yields like 10% effectiveness or something stupid low
---
There is a difference between asserting the accuracy of a statistical prevalence to forward productive discussion and stating an irrelevant fact to provoke a reaction.
---
If nobody is buying your stuff, the 0.01isk war is meaningless
---
&gt; 10-15 dreads in a local fight (not a capital slugfest) would dramatically turn the tide to favor one or the other.
---
As someone who has done lots of null rolling, if someone already has dreads/carriers and a rolling setup ready in a C7 wormhole, and they roll the right region to be a batphone to a fight, then by all means they should be a batphone. Typically I already support more people fighting it out, compared to less people. Particularly via using unexpected mechanics, which tend to yield big fights.
---
&gt; out of Delve to connect us with content
---
If Delve is connected to this C7 via a roaming wormhole, then you won't get the capital level mass. If it is the static, then by rolling it you will commit to being in there for hours, and possibly having no way back. If you do so, then roll it for targets, and find/kill targets, that'd be something I'd support. There is literally no argument against more people killing each other and going on the offensive. That includes Goons. If these wormholes gives you a reason to go do/attend a fleet, I'm already happy. I'm even happy if they help you connect to places you want. The more wormhole connectivity the better.
---
I just had a though. Currently there is injection efficiency so only partial amounts actually get injected and some lost if you have a high SP char. What if there was also an extraction efficiency whereby if you have extracted more in the past future extractions are less efficient. This would keep the mechanic for everyone, but farmed characters deteriorate and are less cabable of extraction to their full potential.
---
WTB option to surrender and join the Great Triangular Crusade. Down with the corrupt Empires!

Might just be easier to have the broker’s fee apply the same or similar way to how it does if you increase a price. Although, I’m fuzzy on how that math would work work out in the end.
---
How can you let broken window syndrome determine where you buy a house for your family? There is no robber and it's merely still broken because it has not been fixed yet. The robber who isn't there won't break into your house, yet you won't purchase a house in that neighborhood. Your making that choice based on a threat that may or may not exist based on your environment.
---
May have made an uneven analogy not only buy using real life but also the entire statement but I'll let the people who remember logic 101 deal with that I'm just here to make bad shitposts that hopefully offend noone. 
---
Thank you for your time and especially your criticism.
---
In lowsec his modus operandi has been to bait with a battleship and cyno in carrier, haw dread, fax, and/or titan as the case may be.
---
More newbros in null would be really good for teaching pvp:
---
\^ This attitude is a good way to lose money without realizing it. I work at a trading firm that does market trading with real money, we use spreadsheets all the time.
---
Asset safety revamp among my proposals is the strongest proposal any candidate ever proposed against citadel spam and citadel warfare. If you have a monetary reward at the end of the excruciating process of killing a citadel, suddenly it becomes worthy to kill one. Works like a charm in wormholes.
---
I don’t disagree entirely.  But for getting you and your stuff to where you want to do things - well it’s why we have clones and end up leaving ships all of the place.
---
That's what an interceptor is supposed to be *for*
---
Mineral trading is already on a razor thin margin on prices, depending on huge volumes to make it worthwhile.  If every price change required a full percent, there very quickly becomes no motivation to even try.
---
There are days where the profit margin on a mineral sell order is already less than 1% - you just depend on selling a few billion of them to make up for that fact.
---
You are a INIT pet, saw your nightmare fly with stukas! not a good position to be a snuff leader.

probably has something to do with the fact nobody in NCPL gives a fuck.
---
Holy crap! Nergals are 1.3 bil isk on the market?!?
---
Could actually work.
---
One problem with it is that getting a new SP farmer to extractable level became essentially free after CCP took alpha SP from 2m to 5m. So if you create a bunch of alphas, and illegaly input broadcast (I unfortunately think CCP wouldn't notice), you can simultaneously log in and get them to 5m for free. So it's not a big deal for people who farm on an industrial level to switch to "fresh characters".
---
That being said, I think currently only MCT farming is profitable. Would take a year to grow 3 chars to 5m as alpha.
---
Technically, since it was on behalf of TEST and not a non-blue third party, I believe this is not an awox, and the more accurate term would be scagging.  Right /u/sapporojones ?
---
Kind notes? This is eve related right?
---
Oh, please - Amarr deserves this kind of invasion too
---
The generic slow paced shooter we saw last year was so boring to watch, I have no idea what it was about even, maybe some sort of defense mission?
---
He probably is a prepubescent teenager.
---
To be serious though. It's a lot harder IRL to block people. The ideas and experinces we cultivate in the digital world will always bleed into reality. Blocking individuals in either won't fix anything unless we distmantle the macro social organisim that is perpetuating the abuse. 
---
It is y'all that need to leave your echo chamber. The rest of the world wants to play EVE too, and they deserve to have a supportive community behind them.
---
&gt; Pirate battleship BPC need a drop rate nerf from DEDs
---
10/10s already suffered a drop nerf just a while back in fact destroying good income for some players, this is a bad suggestion.
---
Buffing navy ships to be on par with their cost is the requirement.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOG_ItnBjp8
---
I know this is a thing now but if a cockpit interior could be added and ship movement can be similar to Valkyrie then I'm sold :D
---
Bombers used to be super-oppressive, and the defender changes were needed. If the battleship because the standard line ship again, I think bombers would be used a lot more and they'd do just fine. In fact I suspect they might still be a bit too strong rather than too weak. Again we return to the oppressive nature of supercapitals - to use another ecological metaphor, they've hunted out the bomber's natural prey species.
---
Adding "large bombers" - some class of specialised ship that is specifically designed to counter 'N+1' massed supercap fleets, but which are weaker vs normal caps and only minimally useful vs subcaps (actually they should be vulnerable to subcaps) would be an easy change to make that could have considerable knock-on consequences.
---
(They don't literally have to be *bombers* as such, or even cloaky, but they should have a similar battlefield role of being able to punish large concentrations of supercapitals. What about commandship-sized MJFDs, for example...?)
---
But its not supposed to be invisible until its too late. A lot of weapons are also ineffective at dealing with small and fast things.
---
More good ideas.
---
Always a good read ty guys!
---
&gt;With enough boosh dessies
---
How deftly you highlight the key weakness of the doctrine.
---
I suggested back in the day to make them lose nullification inside an entosis node grid (where they abused the most), instead ccp removed their nullification completely AND introduced assault damage control rendering them completely pointless even for travel. Now they can't intercept and why fly a crusader if a retri is better in every way.
---
They can serve a lot of good functions if someone at ccp would balance the nerfs instead of hitting everything with a big hammmer everytime.
---
It's exactly as advertised a month ago. We don't actually give a shit about holding the sov. Our playstyle doesn't depend on parking huge fleets of afk rorquals somewhere and never moving them. We'll take it back when they leave, or just move elsewhere.
---
Goons lumbered in with a total of 1300 titans, but are still too scared to engage unless they're 3x enemy numbers. So they're not getting many actual fights. Sucks to be them.
---
While they're up here blinding we've mostly gone whaling in Delve.
---
I always get shaky and enraged when I die like that. I have to take a break and relax and try not to break something.   
---
This guy just laughs. I want to be like this guy.
---
Just knock the price down a decent amount who gives a damn about cents when you walk away with the sale.
---
&gt;How will you defend yourself from accusations/falsifications of NDA breach by the GSM 
---
Shouldn't he be more concerned about accusations/falsifications from the PanFam CSMs?
---
It was a mild nerf, but not much of an effect as you can see by current BS prices. Bhaals are approaching t1 level costs. Cant make navy ships cheaper than t1.
---
If you want navy to perform for their cost, they will outperform pirate ships and have absurd stats. That also breaks the ship progression.
---
Pirate ships need to become rarer, end of story. DEDs still drop plenty of loot. If anything id like to see the nerf to BPC drop rate by 40-50% in DEDs and move 25% of that into lowsec belt spawns like Mordus.
---
It makes me sad. I'm like halfway through the video AMA
---
I’d fleet with you
---
A recon interceptor with hyperspatials can become very OP very quickly.
---
- Remove damage caps on low power structures
---
- let blops warp cloaked
---
- have the events like trig invasion actually do something (turn the highsec system to lowsec while active and fix the loot) 
---
-make diamond rats for all rat ai
---
- increase damage cap on all structures (double) 
---
- bring back sbu's and get rid of sov wands
---
- finish the angel capitals and release their sotiyo
---
- make tz tanking less effective (give attacker the ability to shift exit time by up to something like 6 hours by dropping an offensive structure in the system) 
---
- increase cyno inhib radius to 500km so supercap blobs are less effective
---
Remove cents, it's kinda silly. Yes it's going to make mineral trading more of an issue. Perhaps that means it's a good way to counter trading bots.
---
Solo-corp just RFs own structure prior to the Invasion for a max-spread timer, second RF timer is post-Invasion, bad guys win again.
---
&gt;It  is understood by NER that there was a communication problem with part  of Legacy’s reinforcement capital wing that resulted in some of the  carriers warping to the fortizar as it was dying. Naturally, these  carriers were caught and dispatched easily by WinterCo forces. The  butcher’s bill on this particular engagement was over [83B ISK ](https://zkillboard.com/related/30000516/201905312200/)destroyed,  with Legacy and FIRE losing nearly 73B ISK of that total. This conflict  is only just getting started, and more skirmishes and battles are bound  to unfold. The New Eden Report will keep you informed with updates from  the conflict.
---
I was one of the dumbasses who warped by mistake, but it wasn't the reinforcement wing and it wasn't just carriers. I was in a Phoenix. And I didn't die and neither did most others who warped with me, I think. Bubbles were on the undock, so we simply docked up and logged out. Extracted the next day without issue. If I remember correctly the reinforcement wing engaged deliberately, but I could be wrong. There could also be some that didn't log out in time, it was a pretty close call.
---
Also, would be nice to mention the two fortizars that did successfully anchor. 2 out of 4 is slightly worse than we hoped but still a partial success.
---
Your wish is my command. Olmecca &amp; Jurius Doctor will be out on Thursday.
---
I thought I saw it blow up?
---
Love you Zkill series man! Hope you're doing well.
---
Can you give me the source on that? I'd genuinely like to read it =)
---
That wasn't one guy and his alts though...
---
Wouldn't it better if small gang pvpers found other small gangs?
---
The death of pvp is a direct result from super cap proliferation imo.
---
Even when i played a few years ago it was a problem but you could at least reasonably know who had caps parked nearby, but now everyone has them.
---
It was not 1 person. And over half the fleet was drunk off their ass. While coming back from a roam KF reshipped to gank ships and killed the video'd ark. Well, got it into hull and we went home while Miniluv went back with a second wave to finish it off.
---
with level 5 skills it's just under 5 seconds activation, rounded up to 6 by the tick
---
The SP farming profession relies heavily on the ISK:effort ratio - basically they can set a 30-60-90 day skillqueue and check in once every 1/2/3 months to push butan, collect bacon. That allows skillfarms to be scaled up massively.
---
I'm sure that the anology with rorqual mining hasn't escaped you, but unlike rorqing, there's no way to harrass or interdict skillfarming. And every skillfarm account consumes plex that could potentially have been bought by an active, content-creating player. In fact each skillfarmer account consumes enough plex to support *two* active accounts, because of the plex cost of the extractors. 
---
Making skillfarming at least be harder work is a minimal step towards scaling back the problem.  It's easy to conceive of other possible, stronger mechanics, like some form of "extraction fatigue" that gives an increasing chance of the extraction operation failing (but still consuming the extractor and still leaving the character unable to re-extract that skill in future) as the total number of extractions from a character increases (remember that skillfarming relies heavily on stat implants to boost yields). Eg: the first 5 extracts are risk free, the next 5 have a 1% chance of failing, the next 5 have a 3%, then 5%, 7%, etc.
---
&gt; Wouldn't it better if small gang pvpers found other small gangs?
---
That's small gang consensual warfare. What I'm talking about is whaling. I think they are just different, incommensurable playstyles. Except great consensual fights also occur in the name of defending Rorquals.
---
Proliferation damaged small gang pvp as well as whaling.
---
I dunno if you run 10/10s but I did, it was almost 50/50 chance a machariel BPC would drop, it was actually decent (not great) but ok. After the nerf it became difficult to justify running them as you could spend an hour (including travel) for 3 sites each not and get anything.
---
People farming them now only doing so because that's what they do and that didn't increase the price of BS. Just lowered demand. The eagle replaced the mach for most fleets now as a meta change as a result.
---
So imo if you want more people using navy BSes you would need to buff them to be worth the cost especially compared to the alternative which does not mean nerfing 10/10s to the point they become pointless.
---
No one is going to fly the domi navy with ishtars being so good, or domis being so close at such a lower cost, nerfing 10/10s would not change that 1 bit.
---
Remove cynos and jump drives altogether.
---
Make newbie ships effective enough to PVP so the newbies have something fun to do while they're broke.
---
Only allow X number of weapons/modules to target a given ship/structure.  Would need to apply the same restriction to beneficial mods.  No more instablaps.  Targeting in big groups becomes an operation, squads start to matter etc.
---
Resource scarcity.  Kill Rorqs.  Regionalize minerals to force travel and trade/localized war.
---
Limit structures in a system and make the small ones easier to clear.
---
All ships show on d-scan and are warpable without scanning. 
---
 Cheap disposable effective ships.  You want fast play with little risk and lots of action with few barriers if you want lots of people.
---
I probably wouldn't play the game it would need to become to get numbers but it's buildable.
---
It's Atticus from Period Basis, will you do anything about local and maybe adding a slight delay or something to combat botters
---
Local will also let you know exactly who you're up against. If you've ever done wormhole PVP, you probably know that in some cases, people will bookmark everyone that looks AFK or logged off when combat probing/d-scanning and go around and kill them all. With local, you know when to stop and don't continue d-scanning or probing for years.
---
You are a smart motherfucker.
---
Does getting booshed interrupt a firing cycle? Or does your weapon keep cycling as you teleport around?
---
Hey buddy!
---
Neuts and drones and webs would still work fine.
---
Simulate the fitting from the contracts page
---
IMO the issue is new player hooking not already committed player retention. 
---
As someone who spends a lot of time in rookie help it is very difficult to retain people with the "starter aura" non-sense. The way people get introduced to EVE does not reflect most of the interesting parts of the game. I can tell you without a doubt that so many new players have quit because of a "bugged" career agent or though this game is about mining veldspar at the rate of 1isk/hour.
---
CCP should expose player to much more eve right from the start so they see the good stuff and get "hooked". I dunno maybe drop them in a wh with actual in game videos or "AI assisted" scanning techniques and dscan stuff instead of the "go here mine veldspar".
---
CCP retention people should be mandatory for them to spend at least 1 week say every quarter in rookie help to understand what drives new player away and build ideas on that.
---
Or Capital "HAW reps" so the fitting space /cap usage isn't skewed. Like a Quad Large Remote Armor Repairer I vs. a Capital one.
---
Yeah, no. Points for using y'all correctly, but don't fucking tell me what to do in a video game. I am not the person saying these things, but I will defend their right to say whatever they want. Keep the sandbox/anything goes in EVE, otherwise it's just any other mmo.
---
I'll evemail the industry leaders.
---
Yeah personally I don't have an issue with boosh Ravens. They take a lot of coordination and skill to do right, and that's Eve. Buuut they're also definitely a ball-ache to fight.

They dont work at all in a lot of these cases.

Keeps cycling unless you lose lock on the target I think...been a minute since someone booshed me
---
1. Change sov ownership to an activity system, whereby your claim is based around you moving out the original inhabitants (npcs) and defending it. Anoms would stop spawning in your "capital system" but would become progressively harder (and lootier?) on your frontiers - meaning ratters would HAVE to patrol your borders to rat and give alliances sov and by proxy, provide content.
---
2. Make local need upkeep from sov owners
---
3. Scrap mission agents and provide more interaction points between npc's and players, adding somewhat dynamic and modular content that keeps players moving around
---
4. ?????
---
5. Profit
---
Well if he had 18 ospreys and doubled 17 of them then doubled the 34 that came from the doubling, he'd have 68 ospreys plus the leftover one from the beginning. That makes 69.
---
Yea  welcome to eve 2019    well we as muderous mindset have lost all our sov to panfam renters after 1.5 months  but it was fun but we will try again to take and hold sov
---
All capitals should be purely fleet support with diminishing returns the more that are fielded. Carriers and supers should be assign-only drone boats with some sort of fleet buff and area denial boost (smart bombs). 
---
Dreads should somehow boost damage projection and be solely structure bashers. 
---
Titans should stay the same with phenomena and Doomsday's but no other weapons. 
---
Command ships should be the only command burst capable ships and be more effective than caps in that role. 
---
Downvotes welcome, you know I am right.
---
Now let's put some happy little clouds in here. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power. At home you have unlimited time. A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun.
---
That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. There comes a nice little fluffer. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet.
---
We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy.
---
Put it in, leave it alone. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage.
---
Even the worst thing we can do here is good. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important. And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen.
---
I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. You want your tree to have some character. Make it special.
---
There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbers—just to upset the critics.
---
I'm not sure if this could be done in a year but here we go:  
---
Marketing:  
---
\- Promote in-game content creators such as the noteable streamers and video artists  
---
\- Revive the Scope and similar CCP made in game news. During World War Bee there was a Scope video almost every week that kept people, not directly involved, updated  
---
\- Push for marketing for EVE Online outside of the 5 same tech sites that always cover eve events  
---
\- Make more appearances, if possible, at conventions and presentations (E3, Pax, ect)  
---
Accessibility:   
---
\- Dedicate employee's or CCP vetted volunteers to new play channels or a new new bro npc corp to help with anything that plauges new pilots (fitting ships, career direction post tutorials, ect).  
---
\- Unfuck the default overview. No further comment neccecary.  
---
\- Extend the length of time alpha clones can schedule skill training (I've never understood 24 hr skill caps)  
---
\- Denote which weapons systems are supposed to engage at what ranges (Add a short range and long range to the in game market and fitting tools)  
---
\- Let players opt in or opt out of the UI changes that put all of the icons into catagories. I think we all agree, having to scavenger hunt for your wallet or contracts is dumb.  
---
Gameplay:  
---
\- COMBAT REFITTING FOR TRIAGE ONLY. We all really enjoyed the RnK and similar videos with highly skilled triage pilots.   
---
\- Limit what injected and gifted SP can be used on. Alpha available or non capital ship at the minimum  
---
\- Nerf tracking on HAW titans and buff targeted DD. Make titans into the anti-cap anti-supercap hull they are supposed to be  
---
\- Split dreads into 2 tiers. One for anti-capital, one for HAW  
---
\- Adjust fighters so they aren't so server demanding in the largest fights.   
---
\- Scrap the existing faction warfare system and remake it from the ground up.   
---
\- Nerf citadel dps caps. I'm a fan of a scaling dps cap, the more you commit to destroying a citadel (more people, heavier assets, both) the higher the cap scales.  
---
\- Anti-subcap fit citadels are bad at killing subcaps.  
---
\- Region specific bonuses or materials.   
---
Aethstetic/Art:  
---
\- Introduce player made skins. Skins developed by players will go onto the eve site for community voting similar to the way Rust skins get voted on.  
---
\- Alliance ship skins. They can be as simple as and multiple tone color shift but the alliance logo is mandatory.   
---
\- Clean out the EVE billboard cache. There are still ads from dead corps and alliances still in rotation (looking at you EE ad)  
---
\- I would like the walking in stations option to come back. It would make player interaction in game more meaningful if you're avatar was more present. It would also appeal to more MMO players from other games.  
---
This is just stuff I've come up with off the top of my head.

&gt; Bombing has sadly fallen out of meta due to capital proliferation
---
It was that bombers wreck battleship fleets, so it is now way too risky to field a battleship fleet.
---
Can't use battleships, so up-ship to capitals.

I have a specific proposal for a single ship type that is local delayed. You won't be able to kill bots in it. But you will be able to catch them as a +1 scout, and kill them with other ships.
---
-----------------------------------------------------------
---
New Local Delayed Ship Class
---
Local is argued to be one of the most important guarantors of safety in New Eden. There are many people asking for a complete removal. And there are some who would want to see it tied to infrastructure. The issue with the first proposal is that it’s more drastic even for my own taste. The issue with the second proposal is that, in places that local is a problem, people already have infrastructure. And in empty places with no infrastructure, people actually need to know whether they share the system with someone else.
---
So here is the compromise: A new ship that is local delayed. Here are the specifics:
---
Upsides: Covert cloaky. 0 recalibration. 150 seconds local delayed. Agile. Fast warping. Good ongrid speed. This ship would be a +1 scout hunter.
---
Downsides: 0 damage. Has tank similar to recon ship. No probing or ewar bonus. Can’t light covert cynoes. Can’t take black ops bridges.
---
[wiki.eveuniversity.org](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org) If you have any questions or just want to look something up, this most likely has it.
---
&gt;Oh please, the egoism of GOTG leadership is what got them into that position in the first place. It was their CHOICE to sprawl across 4 of the most decentralized regions in the game in 2017/2018 rather than compressing into a single region for defensive purposes, it was their CHOICE not to retreat or ball up further because it was their CHOICE that their fertile krablands in Branch and Deklein were far more important to them than actual planning.  
---
&gt;Anyone with a few brain cells rattling around in their skulls could have seen what kind of position they were in, but GOTG leadership was too prideful to give up Deklein and Branch and coalesce into a smaller, less plentiful region because muh ticks, muh rocks, muh moonsssss.
---
I agree with that actually. 
---
&gt; TEST plays its victim card when it bests suits them. Considering how the CFC tried to annihilate them in Fountain, then in their retreat to Delve, Curse, and to FW for a stint and yet they can ally with them freely now does not show that they give a shit about who attacks them as long as it is convenient for them to partner with those who are against the most recent group to beat them up.  
---
Well, historically TEST and goons have at least had diplomatic agreements last the extent of their agreed upon time, as far as I know. 
---
And its not really about convenience, its about lesser of two evils. Goons and TEST would like to shoot each other, but we would more like to shoot panfam, so once we've done that we'll probably shoot each other. 
---
&gt; Let's talk about how apparently **SURPRISING** it is for anyone who has played this game past the tutorial stage that PL and NC would haze a group living next to them if they felt like it, and how that group is **SHOCKED** that this occurs despite the longstanding history. If any TEST line members ever thought that a post-WWB MBC new world order of NIPs and NAPs was ever going to be a reality, they were mistaken. Sitting around a singing kumbaya forever and ever may be enough for the 1,000,000,000 j4gs in the CFC right now, but it isn't for everyone else. 
---
1 year of preparation to get a proper war is very short historically speaking, its just that there used to be a lot of small skirmishes over control over good moons in the days of fatigueless titan bridging. Which to the line-member seemed like constant "Grrr I want to kill my neighbors" compared to current peacetime activities (roams and blops). 
---
We're not singing kumbaja, we're singing war songs while forging titans from the metal we harvest from the rocks.
---
Do you think you’re the best person to ever play eve? You certainly seem as such!
---
The fact he has no politics would also be hugely appealing, loves eve, loves the PVP of eve, but doesn't have any desire to benefit any one group.
---
Can you comment on the shirt material quality?
---
Your video was incredibly inspiring but also took A LOT of accounts and A LOT of dedication. How do you think solo players with only one account can be involved in disrupting the current ecosystem? Do you think eve should be more approachable for players with only one (or two) accounts? If so, what changes would you propose to make solo/small gang more approachable for these players? If not, why?
---
I'm an old school player about coming back. But I just want to do PvE stuff. Incursions, missions, mining, trading, building. I have no interest in PvP.
---
Is the game PvE friendly right now? Or is it all suicide gankers still?
---
needs to be in null and burn supers/titans a citadels :-)
---
Fair enough. Im going to just drop my 2 cents for helping all pvp.
---
The problems with the game seem to be a long tradition of ccp bandaiding things and not addressing the real problems.
---
All PvP:
---
Capitals are a problem because they dont follow the rules that subcaps do. They dont lose any meaningful mobility for their size and power bc of cynos and the fighter drones make subcap support unnecessary.
---
Cynos shouldn't be used for surprise attacks at all (really only makes sense for blops). People should have to maneuver their cap fleets into position just like every other fleet. Then the speed edge subcaps should have becomes relevant.
---
For whaling:
---
The other problem is the warp to dock response. Local chat should be reworked. Make players have to work at discovering if someone is hunting near them. If you see a player, or they type, or you scan them. THEN put them in local.
---
For fleet PvP:
---
And finally... capitals need to be less valuable then system control. People need to be willing to lose their big shinies to keep space.
---
&gt; The SP farming profession relies heavily on the ISK:effort ratio
---
I know. I monthly extract 80 accounts myself. But under this proposal I thought what I'd do myself, and the answer was merely having a long skill que and "trimming" those that aren't prerequisites. If I did that only with the Spaceship Command tree I could go on for quite a long time. The price per SP would be more expensive as you need to train some prerequisites, but it wouldn't hold me from farming.
---
I'm not in principle opposing to SP farming. The idea from[ the guy above you](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bwqvra/i_am_olmeca_gold_i_made_one_of_the_most/eq099cn/) sounded better to me. The more you extract an account, the less efficient it becomes.
---
Thanks for the updates! I love when you guys post
---
My argument is that as an FC it's not that players dont have the SP to fly the ship, its their ability as players. Genuine skill. If you spent the time learning the game while training into doctrine ships you would be a far better more capable pilot. That's what i hate, incompetence because these injected noobs have no idea how to play and basically have to be f1 monkeys. I grew up small gang bc's learning every type of combat for 5 fuckin years and i have the killboard to prove it.
---
1000% would train my alt into that instead of using a crow or stiletto
---
Never thought of a local delayed ship.
---
Sounds good :D o7
---
Well, I hate to throw this out here while its so early in development, but I'm re-writing Evernus currently! There's basically nothing useful at the moment, but I just got SDE downloads working last night. You can track the progress over at https://github.com/Meigs2/REvernus :)
---
Having gimped ships in fleet makes it worse.
---
I don't necessarily disagree with your logic, it just comes down to a question of if the person that did the code changes still works there.
---
Well I'm glad I pleased one of the best bot hunters in this game :)
---
The new ships are always like this for 6 months tell supply increases.
---
you'd be surprised all the inventive ways software engineers find to fuck shit up
---
First thing I’d want to know before suggesting any global solutions is the distribution of active ply hour per day between high sec, low sec, and null sec, and WH space.  knowing where my existing customers spend their time will go a long way in understand what area of the game I need to focus on.
---
Aren’t all the suggestions make without knowing those objective current metrics just wild guesses at what will actually draw players in?
---
Well it's a highly specialised doctrine that's specifically designed to evade damage from supercarriers/titans. Trying to fight it with supercarriers and titans is supposed to be frustrating.
---
Here is my suggestions posted up on the eve forums; https://forums.eveonline.com/t/2-suggestions-to-create-eve-2-inside-eve-both-offering-a-fresh-start-new-game-feeling/154984
---
Maybe not, but in situations where a web + neut + light drones wont drive away a ceptor, I don't see how being able to scram off the MWD would help much either.
---
You have my vote! 
---
If you can please make it require more than a T1 15 mil frigate to assault the sov of a systems ihub/tcu. we want actual pvp when it comes to sov battles, we want bigger stuff exploding/on grid  
---
Also the citadel spam is horrible , make it so they cost 10x more isk
---
I'm absolutely in love with the way that, about a year after the power projection restrictions were relaxed, 0.0 looks almost exactly like it did before they were applied in the first place.
---
Yup...we're agreeuing here my dude.
---
Yeah... and so that’s why null and probably even low sec has more people.  Yes local in WH is good.  But it would shut down many activities since you never know if you are safe
---
agreed.
---
People subbed for a month, ran a few invasions. Out for the summer. They'll be back in the fall. Such an anti climatic start.
---
The last thing we need are caps being even better at deleting subcaps.
---
If you cant sell your wears try a diff hub like Jita is the hardest place to sell anything unless you take a buy order or undercut so heavily a trader buys said product. Moving to another hub will likely yield more isk in the sale anyways. What I would like to see the range of editing orders to be galactic wide but I can see that being an issue. Just bothers me that I have to go back to jita to sell shit all the time. Jist kinda forces us to have a trade alt open to baby orders.
---
People tried it, wasn't exciting. Off for the summer now.
---
This is correct.
---
&gt; How do you think solo players with only one account can be involved in disrupting the current ecosystem? 
---
I did most of what I did solo because my living arrangement with wife prohibited talking in comms (changed in recent past). There is no reason for people to not do what I did in teams. It requires its own determination though, if you depend on other people's logging in to do your activity.
---
&gt; If so, what changes would you propose to make solo/small gang more approachable for these players? 
---
I don't think how much small gang can be more approachable to solo players when you can already be a part of lots of gangs roaming daily. You can right now become a hunter for Bombers Bar and hunt supercapitals, for an entire fleet of 150, just with 1 combat prober interdictor. The game doesn't limit your capability of hitting the targets you want with one account and friends. What can perhaps be improved is perhaps bridging the knowledge gap between people and what they can possibly do as a single account owner.
---
You guys hear these cool stories about people multiboxing and maybe get frustrated why it's not possible as a solo player. But I've played years as owner of a single account, and the available activities kept me going. I got my 3rd account no more than 1.5 years ago, despite having played since 2014. There are lots of activities you can do as a single person. And then you can get your own accounts in time. Below are my wider thoughts about multiboxing. I am not as negative to it as some of you are.
---
----------------------------------------------------
---
No. I understand people's frustrations about multiboxing and multiaccounting. I think they emerge mainly from multiaccount moneymaking issues, to which most of the issues with PLEX prices are also tied. Also it might be frustrating to die in PvP to a few accounts whose user is the same. Then again, I think multiboxing is one of the small areas in which an Eve player can become a "progamer". Compared to other games, Eve ship controls and combat mechanics are not too demanding. To be fully fair and honest, is extremely simple to control one ship in Eve, compared to controlling a character in another MMO. Having the knowledge (e.g. transversal, slingshotting, fittings, modules etc.) is more importat than the application of that knowledge. But when you control 7 ships at once, that's where your skills can truly shine and you can be impressive. That's why I started multiboxing, and why some people appreciate my videos. So I don't see multiboxing as negative as some others. It is also the game's reality now and if multiboxed accounts are gone we'll end up with a huge reduction in online counts. CCP wouldn't want that and tbh we would give them a hard time for that as well.

Well last time people flew stukas we lost europe to the germans

If anything goes then don't throw a fit when sociopolitical discourse becomes a part of your metagame. You are welcome to block those of us that share my opinions but we still have a right to vocalize criticisms in regards to your praxis.

if(money) &gt;= more set cokebump=true ;
---
&gt;I have 4 changes that I can't really reduce to 3.  
---
&gt;[Adaptive anomaly respawns](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/9xxc8s/adaptive_anomaly_respawns_an_idea_that_would_fix/):  This basically makes respawns in one null system a factor of how much  farm is being done in the entire nullsec. If implemented nicely, this  would limit the amount of farm an alliance can provide under a single  supercap umbrella, yet leave room for small entities to carve in nullsec  (and even give motivation to large alliances to let small alliances  be).  
---
&gt;[Asset safety rework](http://prntscr.com/nxkrm9):  A mobile structure which reverts the 15% asset safety tax NPCs collect  to the killer corporation of a citadel. Doesn't change anything at all  for the citadel owners. But adds a brand new motivation to attack assets  in non-wormhole space.  
---
&gt;[**Mobile cyno inhibation rework:**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/amgj7y/capital_projectioncynojump_drive_balance_three/)  A range buff to the current inhibs (so defenders really have to warp in  on inhibbed friendly capitals, rather than cyno in), combined with an  active single target module for black ops battleships that shuts down  active cynoes. It would provide a more tangible way to circumvent  supercap umbrellas (the counters right now are having a bigger capital  force, or picking off low hanging fruits via afk camping), which the  game direly needs atm.  
---
&gt;[New Wormholes with Massive NS Statics:](http://prntscr.com/nxktn5)  Either nullsec statics for C6s, or completely new wormhole systems with  nullsec statics with 25m mass. This would support multiple dreads in  and out. The aim here is to increase wormholer/nullseccer interaction in  an Eve which the active population is dwindling. Capital proliferation  greatly reduced the relative force wormholers can project into nullsec  (the old fleets you used to take into nullsec from wormholes are less  effective now due to more capitals). The mass buff would increase it to  balance things, allowing wormholers to bring in capitals to null and  risk them
---
1. **Adaptive Anomaly Respawns** \- you are neglecting areas like the Malpais/Periggan Falls/TKE/The Spire/Oasa, Tribute/Pure Blind/Fade/Deklein, and Wicked Creek/Insmother/Detorid/Scalding Pass exist that don't have much or any ease of NPC Station access. This will hurt smaller entities who can't cover large space with multiple super / capital umbrellas.
---
2. **Asset safety rework** \- this is an unrealistic item to try and code.
---
3. **Mobile cyno inhibation rework** \- this would be extremely abused by every large entity in the game. Example: we would just anchor them off NPC  stations in NPC Delve indefinitely and never have to worry about anything. Shutting down a cyno mid-cycle via \~*targeted module*\~ I can imagine would be extremely hard to code. Big groups, like goons, would spam blackops battleships in escalations essentially crushing the scaling of big fights with no counter b/c you forget blackops battleships have no de-cloak timer and can warp instantly afterwards.
---
4. **New Wormholes with Massive NS Statics** \- how do you not expect this to be abused by the bigger powers in game vs. smaller guys. I'm totally down for this, makes relocating dread caches much easier to farm smaller under-developed groups. I can 100% for a fact say we would just anchor azbels in said wormholes and poop out dreads across the entire galaxy with no resistance, thus furthering our power projection.
---
Asside from your grr-goon focused changes ~~that will totally backfire and help support our various efforts instead~~ do you actually have any realistic goals or changes that CCP would consider? The thing you lack is forsight, but enjoy your 15 minutes while it lasts I guess. Coming down is much harder when you're high on your own farts.
---
Will you give us a voice for some of the old guard wormholers? 
---
Those of us that scour over the lore looking for clues. We lost our chronicle writer, and according to the lore. The entanglement based fluid router network can be used at any distance, which is why cloning works. Why can we jump clone from There to Jita but not Jita to Jxxxxxx, or Jxxxxxx to Jxxxxxx? Jump cloning already has a fatigue built in. already.
---
Yeah same. Wingspan might not be real wormholers but none of us are, at the start, and Chance's videos encouraged me to look into wormholes and avoid unwanted deliveries.
---
You click on 'reports' and then click the time period you want to see that data from, such as:

you know, or unless they said they'd change week after week when they announced them.
---
you read the same subreddit I do, the information was given at release that these would evolve.
---
eve's pretty time based over all, maybe its not the game for you as your level of patience seems pretty suspect.
---
Yea  its true trench warfare   stallmate  when it comes to sov changes sometimes
---
After watching your vid it is obvious you are disgustingly rich in isk. Would you ever consider buying votes? Mines totally for sale.
---
Does anyone have a austrian in their alliance we can assasinate ? Corp or alliance leader prefered
---
How do you get kited to death if you burned off the beacon? Unless you fit brawl ab fit.. Min which case you got time to warp away
---
What's that do?
---
I don't like basing game mechanic proposals to lore reasons, or deriving support to game mechanics from lore.
---
I think not being able to jump in and out of wormholes is a healthy part of the game's ecosystem. Imagine big wormhole corporations taking over the entire high class wormhole space (at least C6), because they can now defend all the wormholes they have via clonejumping.

Good music? Where

So far Spectre's campaign hasn't been impressive, tho. They whelped one fleet on Saturday, and nothing since then. If it's just going to be a weekly whelp... mehh.

The burning shit down for the lulz require lulz. Generally those lulz come in the form of a reaction from the recipient. Given the investment of the 3 timers, (especially when the ref timers are tz tanked), the reaction has to be pretty good. Unfortunately, with the cost what they are, and the fact that the guy who lost his structure loses neither its contents nor any time beyond making the isk back versus how long you spent shooting (30min * 3 timers * players used), you're *nearly* always net negative on lulz.
---
I definitely remember anti-russian sentiment to at least these levels 4-5 years ago
---
I hope to see a nice video of the 1vs1 in your chanel, good luck op!
---
yeah, but wormholes also have much better ref mechanics, with less tz tank and less overall time spent.
---
making horrible, unfun citadel grind more profitable won't make it more fun. they need to remove a timer across the board in lowsec and nullsec, and the defender should not be able to choose the day.
---
Look how well underestimating nullsec worked out for Hard Knocks.
---
10 dreads by themselves aren't that much of a threat. 10 dreads at a time being seeded into your hole over a few months is going to be enough to evict you pretty quickly.
---
If you have a problem with my right to challenge the social structure of our community then what you're really saying is "keep the sandbox the way I like it". Which is what all of us are initially going to lean towards but don't pretend that you have no agenda for the future of new eden because ultimately any of us that are passionate about the game do.
---
I remember that time some1 gifted me billions in insurance payouts.
---
Wait, can you setup your overview to hide the structures you don't want to see? I've only noticed hiding categories (eg. *all* astrahauses). If I can't dock at one, and I'm not planning on attacking it, it might as well not be there, except it is.
---
What if there was a mobile app for station trading and PI?
---
I think its interesting his response jumped directly to FW. It goes to show that FW is the only thing of value currently in lowsec in peoples minds.
---
Thanks. I was out of salt and didn't know what I'd use to season my eggs.
---
Sorry. Reading comprehension is only trained to 1

pretty sure you can report that kind of activity to youtube.
---
Like Redline is a bastion of facts to be trusted about the Imperium. He has an ax to grind as his salty AAR shows, Reavers almost always fight outnumbered and outgunned. We fought for 6mos under the super and titan umbrella of the north. The whole of the Imperium Deployed to Hakonen minus all our Supers and Titans and fought under the Murtha super/titan umbrella.  In X47 the numbers on each side were within 1 or 2% of each other.  When has any other alliance deployed to Delve to take us on, only TEST tried it right after us arriving in Delve.
---
You can super rat in a -0.1 if you want, or support 4-5 VNIs. It's still pretty useful space to have.
---
You've got to love a civilization of invaders who uses words like "liminality" and "poshlost" in their marching orders.
---
&gt; this is an unrealistic item to try and code.
---
This is a deployable structure.
---
- Upon 30m of deploying, it targets a citadel and starts a process (e.g. MTUs target wrecks and start pulling).
---
- When the process is finished in 5 days, the corp who owns the structure gets the tax that is already calculated currently, and taken from wallets of people. So all CCP needs is adding a recipient.
---
- It has range limits like how citadels have range limits from certain objects. It has a range limit from another deployable of the same type, like mobile cyno inhibs already do.
---
Literally all mechanics you need for this item is already in the game. If you can tell me how it's impossible to code, I'll be convinced you're not just bitching to be a bitch. Right now you're just being hateful. The overall positivity I get for this thread and the video should be eating you alive as you genuinely think I am a sperg lord, nobody likes me or likes to play with me. That's what happens when you believe in lies that you made up lol.
---
they were used all the time, just not on grid because they didn't have to be. and the links weren't as powerful then either
---
Are you now, or were you ever, gay4Jay?
---
I'm not saying it's accurate or justified but real talk if I thought I could make more money botting a game and RMTing the profits instead of or in addition to working a full time job I probably would too.  It's easy to talk from a moral high ground when you're not actually presented with the choice.  And in most places it's not actually illegal to break the tos of a spaceship video game.  If you could run a program on your computer and make $20,000-$30,000 USD/yr doing something that had almost no investment nor risk if it didn't work out wouldn't you?
---
Awsome video man :)
---
You will almost never be able to web a pointing inty. Drones have issues applying because of how obsolete the stop/orbit/shoot-system is. Neut can work if you are in a BS, but you have still almost no chance of killing it before the blob arrives. Mjd + gimped fit might be your best bet. Overall, small kitey stuff is way too risk free.
---
Sounds like people i can get along with hahaha
---
TIL you never noticed how goons spent months shitting on horde before starting in on Tribute. And if NC runs away to horde space to hide and horde let them do you really think we won't follow since we are already there?
---
I wouldn't oppose making citadels easier to kill.
---
I just don't have specific ideas on how. It's a tricky issue of balance between the defender and the offender.
---
you are not lol,I am from a low income country,Eastern Europe.You act like botters are people who are forced to do this.I play the game pay for my subs with real money,for which I work for in a part time job.
---
Oh well, maybe the Triglavians will take care of it. *fingers crossed*
---
Whatever The Judge is paying you, I'll pay double.

You probably have some genious solution to achieve that. Let's hear it.

Remember kids - unassailable wealth and peerless martial strength is only a bad thing when the other guys are doing it!

I'm upvoting it simply because he /u/RedheadPopcorn signed off "Fly dangerous." That's cool shit.

Not sure if /r/eve allows call out threads

Technically frat isn’t blue to skillu nc. ph pl ..yet they keep turning up in the south somehow.
---
It’s never been all suicide gankers. 
---
If you fly stupid stuff through high sec that makes you profitable to kill then yeah you’ll probably die.
---
I think there was solid, balanced play and counterplay between battleships and bombers. Caps became cheaper to field and too OP to pass. Thus why use battleships now.
---
tldr that shit
---
What is you favorite ice cream flavor?
---
Ya I mean I guess it's a crapshoot. The corp I joined almost always has at least a few people online. Even if they aren't playing actively they're always down to help roll holes. 
---
In nullsec I did the megacorp stuff and even some smaller groups but it felt like there were actually *too many* people online sometimes, if that makes sense. You just get lost in it.
---
Who flys internet spaceships safely Hound?
---
"Lots of cu#@$"
---
I have favorite color composition, rather than a flavor.
---
1 yellow, 1 red, and chocolate = ideal ice cream cone. Having 3 cups all the time is one of the reasons why I'm fat. Particularly now that I'm in the US and the portions are fucking insane.
---
I mean mittani himself said it. Blueball or squash with overwhelming force. I have zero reason not to believe redline either.
---
Like I said. 2% and 98%. Most goons are not reavers. Anytime we've formed up to fight you and its a reasonably equal fight ya'll either run or ping for reinforcements and double your numbers.
---
I don't see anyone asking this, so: how do you plan to bring your platform to CCP's attention? Each CSM member has their own stance, but they all ultimately need the dev team's support to achieve their goals, and that means getting the staff on your side.
---
Fair enough, do what you feel comfortable with, but I will say if you have scanning skills to level 3/4 and can fly a covops cloak you are automatically going to be useful to a WH corp, even if you can't fly a Sleipnir or something (which I still can't).
---
&gt; The odds of this being identical across both data sheets was 14,000,605 to 1. There was no way it was a coincidence
---
was starting to be on the edge of my seat until about this point. gg... gg...
---
We'll most likely see a huge price spike as soon as they get reworked.
---
Get a renter corp in and be a warp in or covert cyno against blue bots. Really most effective way.
---
can we just blame goons?  I mean, grrr ... goons  :-)
---
jeveassets includes transaction tracking with % profit and a worth graph with lines for assets, escrow, margin, wallet, etc. It's probably not everything you're looking for but a great tool in its own right. The developer, GoldenGnu, is active on discord and very responsive to feature requests. https://eve.nikr.net/jeveasset

If i learned one thing from this video. Launch &amp; returning turns is a cancer mechanic to try and get a jam trigger lol.

And yet even after the changes to BPCs, bhaals vary between 210m-270m and rattlesnakes are \~440m. Meanwhile things like a navy geddon are 471m and Dominix Navy are 500m. Machs are \~370-400m and Tempest Fleet is \~280m (mainly due to minmatar LP being cheap from T5). No one is going to pick a navy domi when the rattle exists, unless you buff it to absurd levels. Which is what i've already told you. If you buff navy ships to "adjust for their price" then you break progression as Then it would go T1 -&gt; Pirate -&gt; Navy which doesn't follow the path for every other ship line. 
---
You can't fix navy ships until pirate ships become rarer/more expensive. You can't make navy ships cheaper than current pirate levels as you start competing with T1 battleships. If you look at cost progression, going from a navy frigate or cruiser to pirate is a x2 to x3 increase in cost. Its broken on the battleship side due to pirate BPC's being so easily farmed, combined with low demand for navy. Even if you make Navy Battleships desirable, they will still be directly competing with pirate battleships, and most people aren't going to consider a 50-100m difference in cost a huge issue and just jump straight to the pirate battleship that gets more bang for the buck.
---
There is more to the game than PVE and Fleet fights. No one might use a N.Domi over an Ishtar to rat, but they might use a Navy Domi over a Rattlesnake if they have high armor skills, or live in a WH that gives armor bonuses if its bonuses were effective for the role (though Nestor might still be better now).  Solo or even Wh comps could still utilize them, not everything revolves around nullsec/PVE.  If everyone felt the way you do about losing DED isk, then pirate battleship prices wouldn't be so screwed up as they are now, so apparently there are plenty people farming DED's (not even taking into account all the hoarding of BPCs from null entities).  
---
People stopped using Mach's in fleets because they lost a low and got a range bonus nerf, they could no longer tank as effectively and project to fight on Citadel grids. Hence why boosh ravens and eagles are thing now. If cost was an issue, they wouldn't be choosing eagles as they're comparable in price to machs. Current market shows:
---
Eagle: 314m
---
Mach: 370m
---
Cost isn't a factor in why they switched doctrines, balance changes were. The BPC nerf was to try to inflate pricing to make them less attractive, but it doesn't work when DED's are nearly perfectly safe to run and people can farm them with near impunity (except against hunters who sit on gates for lengths of time). The low slot/range nerf did them in as a doctrine, not BPC changes.
---
You cannot compare eve history pre skill injection with the current state. And back in the 2007/2005 times etc. there where far more entities that where neutral to one and another.
---
Doesn't stop people from botting in WoT. They're just amazingly bad and fuck your games up if they're on your team. It's not hard to tell which players are bots either from the stats but WG is even more braindead than CCP.
---
You can't get things out of an audit log container without the password, and can't repackage it until it sits untouched for at least 2 weeks.
---
First, you have my vote anyway. I am just curious here.
---
Doing black ops solo (or in a small gang) is currently insanely hard + for most, incentive is not really there: in most cases, you can just drop caps or rather a small bomber/t3 gang and have better results. Anything off the top of your head? Do you see that as a problem at all? In ideal world of yours, what role black ops battleships have? 
---
Also, what would you do to make Widow relevant again? 
---
Thanks for promoting the gameplay many hardly even heard of ♥
---
...literacy's hard, I get it. I guess you don't have books in your mobile depot?
---
Because you actually had to fight to hold what you built?
---
That's a challenge. The inner workings of CSM seem to be such that people have to come together to propose agendas to CCP. Given the composition of CSM I don't see myself pushing most things that I want into the game. 
---
But it wouldn't be reasonable to not elect non-empire builders just because the composition of CSM is typically empire builders. Meanwhile, I think the a "grassroots" candidate without a null empire to bloc him in could attract more attention from CCP. I can already say, without going on details, I had certain devs asking me questions in my areas expertise on certain non-NDA balance issues they are working. That is thanks to people's appreciation of the video and my candidacy. Even without getting elected, I think my platform already began to help shape this game for the better at this point.
---
Moreover, I think that CSM initial consensus isn't about the level of specific proposals, but particular big picture problems. I think many other empire builders would agree that 
---
- Eve needs more explosions and pvp interaction
---
- Citadel mechanics and emergence of wars needs to be looked at
---
- Risk/reward in nullsec needs to be looked at
---
If we start from there, we can talk details on how to fix those big picture problems later during the meetings.
---
What do you mean? At invasion stage 1 there is LITERALLY nothing else you can do whatsover
---
Destroyers make good snipers but as a ship class they're to slow and squishy with a sig radius that screams "please don't fly me into the middle of a blob". A ceptor would fulfill the role much better imo.
---
I like flying my super and carriers, rorqs are more fun than I thought they'd be, burning down fade and pure blind was a blast last year and I've been waiting 10 years to fuck with NC. like this.   
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbHqGqNZZ7M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbHqGqNZZ7M)
---
I use jeveassets. Its fantastic!
---
i wouldn't because i am too lazy to do even that but suppose i wasn't then i 100% would yes maybe ccpls no ban
---
isn't $20-30k still a bit on the high side though? like $5-15k would still be ok but the ethical cost is now a bit more considerable
---
an excuse is something people approach from two angles though, you have the botter justifying the act to themselves, and the players excusing the botter for the act. i guess most players consider the latter meaning when talking about an excuse.
---
No, you can buy skill remotely now.
---
    Caldari Navy Heavy Missile Launcher
---
wait... what?
---
and that is why Delve content so much better, no structure bashes and Kms to 100+bn can be had in matter of minutes.
---
Who?
---
Poor provi, anytime someone wants content they get the fuck raided out of them
---
I don't think it's reasonable to make $30k USD botting a game, but I think in some countries it's possible to make the in-country buying power equivalent of making 30k USD in the states.
---
Doesn't this just make it more profitable for a group to operate on a locust fleet style of operations?
---
Where a group moves as a massive swarm into a hostile region, runs their sites, and then moves on?
---
Itd benefit big groups who could actually do that, while nerf the other groups around them (because they'd be first on the chopping block)
---
that is a tactic in this war.  Your own leaders said they will not take fights they could lose either, they will look for opportunities where they can win.  They are doing the exact same thing.
---
If you make a new video i will gib u all my cummies daddy
---
I dunno, goons put weird stuff in slot 10 sometimes
---
Or at least get your butt in Discord.
---
But hulls are supposed to have drawbacks. Dessies get frig tracking and cruiser dps at the cost of sig and speed. You're asking for something that would be inherently imbalanced and would oppress other classes.
---
If it's made of atoms now, what was it made of before?
---
Good thing BOT is still holding their sov. /s
---
&gt; You act like botters are people who are forced to do this.
---
i don't think i've implied that anywhere, my comment was a half meme half serious answer. i just said that botters who are behind the language barrier (most of them) usually don't come around here arguing for their stance, and even if they did, it wouldn't matter because that's never going to be a valid excuse for the general playerbase and ccp.
---
sorry if i sounded like an ass, am from low income country too

I don't think undefended citadels mean anything for the NER report.

When M-O keepstar will die, sure, even if nobody really cares about it now.

&gt; Doing black ops solo (or in a small gang) is currently insanely hard + for most, incentive is not really there: in most cases, you can just drop caps or rather a small bomber/t3 gang and have better results. Anything off the top of your head? Do you see that as a problem at all? In ideal world of yours, what role black ops battleships have?
---
Yes! I literally talked about this in the video :). I don't necessarily see "having to drop a fleet" a problem particularly for capitals. But the invalidation of solo blops is maily due to the shift in the target profile from battleship and below to capitals (and when you do drop on battleships, they cyno in capital alts).
---
I don't know how to take back the capital proliferation. But I do propose an active targeted item that shuts down active cynoes. That is an incentive to bring blopses on grid even with large fleets.
---
&gt; Also, what would you do to make Widow relevant again?
---
Give it a target painting bonus, make it a heavy DPS platform. Panthers are agile/kitey. Sin has neuts vs active tanked whales. Deemer has tank in those rare large fleet drops. Widow can be the one with top notch DPS, best active tank, and the ability to paint/apply to small stuff.
---
That's what you get for not being able to spell.
---
Evernus is a bit buggy, but it works fine still...
---
The difference is we're looking for fights we \*can\* take, even if we might lose.
---
You generally won't take fights unless you \*will\* win.
---
Which is fine. Both are legitimate strategies. But own it.
---
No. I am not arguing for regional depletion of resources. I am arguing for an overall reduction of resources in the entire nullsec. The system (if you read the details in the topic) just makes sure that 2/3 of all space is needed, and 1/3 of space is available for taking to small alliances.
---
Oh yeah. Finding the ideal group can be a crapshoot as you said. Glad your hole is a good one!
---
&gt; I suggest you contact an alliance diplo and report their behaviour
---
What will the PH diplo do about this?
---
Well i've tried to get in touch with one, they are kinda rare tbh cause i still didn't found one and gave up.
---
Please, dear god. I've been saying the powerblocs desperately need something to throw their supercap fleets at, and this could be it. Better yet if Trigs could ignore things like RF timers depending on the level of player activity in a system.
---
Nope. The super umbrella would move, and then the krabs would have their rock.
---
That's a good question, that only a diplo can answer.
---
You only get once to make a first impression, and they blew it.
---
You saying TEST can help Goons but the north should not pay on the same coin?
---
I've run into this guy and his corporation before; they are nasty pieces of work, recommend avoiding interacting and definitely blocking.
---
I remember that I was way happier when my killboard was green and red than I am right now when my killboard is fully green with the big orange 100+ sign on the right side.
---
On the one hand dope playstyle and dedication to the game(with a bit too many chars), on the other hand very effective communication is key to get things done, and I feel like you are a bit too big a sperg for that
---
that's right buddy!  
---
 you're worth the effort to make multiple Reddit accounts to post comments to  
---
Caught me red handed
---
Well, the feeling is mutual.
---
Hmmm now I'm not so sure I should
---
I think this is a taxation problem.
---
If you tax the economic activity too high in your country (e.g. 80%), then people will cease from conducting economic activity and it'll eventually collapse.
---
If you tax it too low, then you'll be unable to address the overall system's needs.
---
15% is a good ratio I think, in which offensive playstyles of Eve would have enough content and the farmers of Eve wouldn't feel oppressed.
---
It's not fantastic, mid range. Definitely air dry them. The hats and mugs though are outstanding.
---
Do you see yourself more as a community guy or as deep knowledge guy?
---
What are you talking about? We chased your little gang for an hour and you didn't turn and fight.
---
&gt; I am no metagamer or empire builder. I am not running for recognition, "being relevant", or "furthering the interests of my empire". I genuinely care about Eve's health
---
sup lord varys
---
You make a good point. In an effort to give them distinction from AF's I would rather them move in the assassin direction I mentioned and become more squishy if needed to keep the risk vs reward balanced.
---
It was my understanding that those citadels were essentially forfeited. Unanchor and try to get out what you can or sell for pennies to the invaders. Little of one basket little of the latter happens. Didn’t really seem like anything of note imho.
---
10-15 dreads/carriers through a wormhole? That's a **significant** jump over what we have now (where 3 caps is basically the limit for high-class connections).
---
What we don't need is more systems. What I *would* like to see, though, is C6 systems receive Nullsec statics so as to increase their value and up contest over them.
---
Fair, didn't mean to imply people don't bot.  But it doesn't impact the entire game like Eve botting fucks the economy.
---

Can i bring a drake?
---
I'm talking about the fleets I have taken into Tribute and I assure you I have seen no horde or NC or PL chase me aside from one time we gated 10 thrashers into 30 jackdaw gatecamping and they chased pods.
---
Here's a radical change:
---
Merge Citadels, I-Hubs, and TCUs together into just Citadels. Limit one Citadel per system. Allow anchoring of Citadels in lowsec, highsec, and WH space but disable I-Hub and TCU functionality for those structures. Add in old Outpost mechanics whereby Citadels have service modules that can be entosised to disable them, so you can for example disable tethering service on an enemy Citadel. Allow Citadels to be destroyed as they are today.
---
Remove weapons from Engineering Complexes and Refineries. Limit one Engineering Complex or Refinery per moon and restrict them from being anchored elsewhere. Provide no timer for ECs and Refineries at low power and one timer for ECs and Refineries that are powered. Provide no timer for ECs and Refineries anchored in a system where sov is not controlled by the structure owner.
---
I await being told why this will not work.
---
&gt; guess Pandemic Horde is the pubbie null sec alliance that is maybe a feeder for the husk that is Pandemic Legion.
---
Seems to be more the other way around these days
---
Listen, the Chinese figured EVE out from the very beginning. It's all about building, not about fighting. Put the squabbles down and embrace the Communist Revloutsion.
---
To paraphrase Ho Chi Min.
---
You can destroy 10 of our ships for every 1 we destroy of yours, but even at those odds, you will lose and we will win.
---
You can run Havens in a VNI so I have no idea what you're talking about.
---
Well if he's not getting into web range then what the fuck is a scram going to achieve?
---
You don't need something uber blingy to run a Haven. A VNI with minimal skills can do it. Just fit a 100MN and a cap battery, do Rock Havens only, and orbit the Pirate Gate at 30km with your AB on. You might have to warp off once in the later waves but it's not going to destroy you.
---
they have identical tz tank, the only difference is the minimum time between timers and loot
---
Yes. People keep bringing us content. Poor us.
---
My recollection as a frequent chipmover and onetime PETCO commander is that they would chipspam you sometimes but really weren't a threat to hold anything via actually winning live battles.  I feel like I recognize your name from wotlabs or something.
---
This is my Eve account, I post under another name everywhere else.  Can't be letting people know I'm a psycho after all.  Or let the psychos doxx me lol
---
...you do realise that there's a spectrum between "complete victory" and "total defeat", right?
---
Name me a war that was won without a defeat by the winning side.
---
A TEST guy that's actually fair and balanced.
---
I salute you.
---
We're all part of the journey of life. Help me help you to make this game better for everyone.
---
So you acknowledge that it's not a bad strategy.
---
lol bloodofgods is a known retardonk
---
is this news, or an opinion piece? How about the fact that this sotiyo https://zkillboard.com/kill/77112833/ was actually 194b with the rigs they ripped off? Does that meet your requirement for news, or should we wait for ncpl to tell you what is news worthy?
---
I mean, Horde seems pretty alright on that front.
---
I love how people pretend as though PanFam hasn't already resigned themselves to defeat and are just trying to inflict as much damage as possible in doing so.
---
Can’t fly a kestrel in a haven
---
Wait what? they are precious and valuable now because they spawn sites no one wants? Is that right or am i reading this wrong?
---
so his change would result in the most valuable systems.... STILL being the most valuable. How is that a change?
---
Can't be. They're too busy making nullsec suck.
---
You seem mad that no one cares that you're blowing up undefended space buildings
---
\*Unpopular
---
Counter to popular thinking you can super/carrier rat in any nullsec system with a super/carrier, you just don't get max ticks or lots of cap spawns.
---
How are you planning to sneak a few of your pubes into Aryth's meal at the CSM dinner ?
---
&gt; 10-15 dreads/carriers through a wormhole? That's a significant jump over what we have now (where 3 caps is basically the limit for high-class connections).
---
The significant jump is the very point. They'd essentially require higgs capitals to collapse. And could support 10+ dreads/carriers in and out. The idea behind that number is the ability to kill a solo titan/super in 2/1 sieges.
---
&gt; What we don't need is more systems. 
---
My proposal specifies these systems to be just a few (15ish), and to not have farm. Their addition wouldn't harm the already fragile wormhole space ecosystem. I wouldn't, however, be able to offer the same massive NS static for C6. That would be invasive to wormhole space.
---
Meanwhile, I do have the C6/null static in my CSM bid. It is not a full alternative to the above idea, but a start. Perhaps this with 4-5 shattered wormhole systems with the above-described massive nullsec statics would address the need.
---
No, but you can fly a VNI in one. And to be honest if you're ratting in a Kestrel you're doing something wrong.
---
Lol I am sure the 300k In bounties at 5% would have little effect on the Corp wallet. I would like players that fly smaller ships to be included in null sec ratting mechanics like system indexes.
---
Who escapes gate camp like that?
---
You've witnessed most of my sperg vs Goons and their toxic pressure. It's a miracle to not implode into full Gevlon under that pressure. I think I'm doing very good compared to others who has been through that, particularly lately.
---
y'all seem to talk about that delve ihub you killed alot though
---
HAVE YOU SEEN WHAT THEY DID TO ELEMENTALIST, BANE, AND STORM BRAND? HOW CAN I STAY CALM AFTER READING THAT
---
You're forgetting my expertise in cloaking and cloaky stuff.
---
Someone must serve the realm.
---
People rat in kestrels all the time in high sec the only reason they don’t in null is because the sites that are doable don’t spawn. Null space should have all the content so there is a reason for more players to go there. 90% of space in this game is empty this would bring lots of explorers out to null to take advantage of high index space with less risk to thier wallet. Most players can not afford to lose a vni once a week
---
What about all the corps that would love to have new players and would commit to protecting their space
---
What would your plan be to fix ECM? As it stands, the module no longer works, which makes alot of wasted sp in different areas. Such as how it now makes 0 sense to train sensor compensation skills.
---
This was before that, Waffles announced their deployment and after that TEST declared they would support Provi against PL. Showed up for a few fights and then disappeared until Provi pretty died, and while not being there to help Legacy absorbed tons of their members.
---
Not sure. Did I bring that up? This is about making them invisible on dscan. I think thats a bad idea as larger ships have trouble dealing with small and fast stuff.
---
thatll do CODESpan, thatll do.
---
I’m new to EVE and completed the tutorial missions. Everyone says the real fun happens when you join a Corp so I applied to the noon friendly ones I’ve read about, karmafleet, brave newbies. But was denied... so now what.? Thinking about quitting.
---
TAPI promised to help defend provi against Panfam, proceeded to abandon their "ally" and then came back after poaching tons of ex provi into their coalition.
---
They always said they would help provi against Panfam, I was with Waffles then and distinctly remember the promises that TAPI/Legacy made so they could keep Panfam off their doorstep.
---
You are expecting them to connect the code of essentially a moon-siphon and the code of all assets stored inside a structure and even worse processed in asset safety. It's already impossible to see what's being asset safetied unless you travel to unpack it in-station. On top of this you expect the in-game calculations to be correct. This whole process would require the game to process the structure destruction, analyze whether or not one of these was nearby, determine if it was targeted (what about during downtime?), run more equations which you assume is easy peasy, and that's just what I can think of and I know little-to-fuck all about programming. This is also, like all your other ideas, easily exploitable as people could just use altcorps to asset safety tax-evade on their own structures.
---
&gt; The overall positivity I get for this thread and the video should be  eating you alive as you genuinely think I am a sperg lord, nobody likes  me or likes to play with me. That's what happens when you believe in  lies that you made up lol. 
---
No, honestly I'm saddened. It was entertaining at first, the back and forth, and how extreme your banter would get. But now people are setting you up for big failure and I honestly don't know if you can handle it. You have really bad ideas, no one is voting for you based solely on your points - you're being voted for b/c other groups think you \~make the gewniez mad\~ and you're the current meme. This could potentially, and unfortunately, take away from real candidates who promote positive change and work well with others like Suitonia that represent groups not nullsec affiliated.
---
I would repurpose jamming ships for "tank" role which Eve doesn't have. If you think about it, jamming as a mechanic is now essentially a "taunt". If you upgrade jamming ships from "shit tank" to "pretty tanky", you have a line of rather useful and interesting ships again.
---
Meanwhile, I also argue that fighters should be exception to the new jamming rule. But that is less to fix jamming, and more to balance capitals.
---
so when the keepstar pops will that be ignored as well because they can't be asked to defend their space?
---

I hope TTT gets destroyed just for lols
---
Everyone IS roleplaying. Pirates, empire builders, politicians, diplomats, thiefs, etc etc....
---
Why would the bigger group allow smaller groups to exist then? 
---
Right now, they are left alone, because they take space that's not needed. 
---
But if a group today needs to occupy 3x its footprint to have the same income,  they'll simply take control over the surrounding regions, burning the smaller groups.
---
Additionally, smaller groups would be less capable of "staying under the radar" and less capable of actually growing.
---
An unironic 'didn't want those regions anyway' lmao
---
&gt;same number of anoms but randomized between every option. Then the null ratters who are used to their havens suddenly have less of them, so they’re just running whatever is available leaving the newbros with still nothing to do.
---
I don't see the problem here. They share tickers, they can share sites/systems/etc.
---
battle witch loves to talk shit and bring friends to support his ego when it doesn't work out in his favor. he once told me that he was better at life because he owned a bmw. total twat waffle.
---
Kids with guns paid frat the same idk they paid test btw.
---
&gt;easily
---
yeah good luck getting thru a hole that will be bubbled non stop upon finding said 10 dreads
---
The problem is also that even if you boost fitting, the combat inties are all gun platforms.  Their application at speed is trash, so the cant really do the COMBAT portion of their job.
---
&gt;So far this event has been a dull, boring mess with no rewards, and feels half finished at best in pure CCP fashion
---
Arguments? The event is fun, just go with friends. It's not an event for playing alone. No rewards? we take home like 400m for 2 hours of work. It's pretty lucrative. The event have several phases, we didn't even pass the 1st phase and you're saying it's "half finished". You whole comment is half finished. It's like giving an opinion on Summer even when it has just started.
---
You r gay ! pawned !
---
oh yes i'm sure nullbloc #15 will be rage rolling their jspace statics(that their kspace systems really 100% have) to reach them
---
kek it works fine
---
You'd need to read the details of the full proposal on why.
---
Essentially I propose the entire nullsec to spawn 1.5 times of all the farm done in nullsec, each day. That means 1/3 of nullsec is mathematically guaranteed to be useless. In fact, you want small alliances to go in there and carve their space and farm, so more sites spawn in your systems as well.
---
And the beauty of it is that CCP can iterate on balance by just changing that multiplier. Does it feel like large alliances don't leave space? Change that multipler to 1.7 or 1.9. Does it feel like we again collapsed in a system where umbrellas grow too large and too many people are condensed? Then reduce the multiplier back. Easy balance for life.
---
&gt;no rewards
---
Besides the salvage needed to build the tech 2 trig ships. I'll keep my billions over here... keep doing what you're doing.
---
A _long_ time ago, I had my first and only experience with motion sickness in a video game. 
---
It was the hovercraft part of Half-life 2 -- that slippery motherfucker was hard to pilot. I managed to compensate by staring at the crosshairs and not the environment.
---
And _that's_ what made me want to pray to the porcelain gods.
---
So my suggestion is change what you look at when panning around. Look at the moving nebulae... Or stop it if already do so.
---
He might buy a few percent of a replacement M-0 keepstar for NCPL though.
---
You can always try joining a different noob friendly corp. Eve Uni, Pandemic Horde, some FW one. The large NS based newbro corps aren't necessarily the best for all playstyles, and the two that you picked tend to be the more restrictive/bureaucratic newbro corps. 
---
You don't even have to join a corp, and plenty of players have fun cutting their teeth solo. It does give greater access to veteran assistance, as well as financial backing which is why it's recommended to join a corp.
---
I like it! Would you be able to make a drop down for ship categories? i.e. 'show all command destroyers'  The search function works well but it might be advantageous to be able to see multiple hulls at once.
---

7b worth of Talos' for nothing, cause your scanner doesn't know that when stuff is double wrapped, you don't see "plastic wrap" on the scan, you see the container.
---
Plz tell more about the capbattery market
---
Hi, I think I've made up my mind to vote for yourself as I attend NPSI and use wormholes and the views of your campaign match what I want to see in a future eve.
---
As i predominantly live in lowsec My question is, aside from fw lowsec, have you any ideas on what lowsec alliances or corps could do in the future to prove control over their constellation or systems of lowsec other than just anchoring some citadels and saying that's mine get lost. Fyi some of the best fights I've had have been in lowsec.
---
I tried wormhole space. Found a decent corp with friendly people, was good fun when we actually found fights. Id spend hours scanning for little reward. Admittedly it was my first time in WH space so maybe I was doing something wrong? On top of that two other WH corps kept an alt logged out in our hole and would scan them in daily. Don't have the people to fight the numbers/ships they bring, eventually found myself playing less and less due to knowing they were watching 24/7. Couldn't krab either to make a little isk back to buy new ships. Had it's ups and downs, probably give it another go once I've worked on my subcap skills
---
Flying a vni is boring and dull. So if I like to do pve in a frigate I have to be locked in high sec it makes no sense
---
I'm fairly sure I've never mentioned any ihubs anywhere in Delve.
---
Oh lord here we go
---
Not to mention to clear a null sec anoms in a vni takes 40 mins I think it would be cool to have a faster option that obviously is not as lucrative
---
&gt;People rat in kestrels all the time in high sec the only reason they don’t in null is because the sites that are doable don’t spawn. Null space should have all the content so there is a reason for more players to go there.
---
Nullsec is supposed to be harder than highsec. If you want low-level sites that can be done in a frigate, rat in highsec. If you want to rat in nullsec, bring a VNI.
---
&gt;90% of space in this game is empty this would bring lots of explorers out to null to take advantage of high index space with less risk to thier wallet.
---
It's far from the case that "90% of space in this game is empty". In fact, the vast majority of space is occupied in some way or another. It might seem empty if you enter someone's space during an off timezone but I assure you that it isn't. Also, EVE needs more risk, not less.
---
&gt;Most players can not afford to lose a vni once a week
---
Actually, most players *can* afford this. A fully-fit VNI is only about 120Mn ISK and with 10Mn ISK ticks (which is the low end of what you can get running rock havens) that's what, 4 hours of ratting? Hell, I'm broke as fuck and I can still afford to fly a VNI.
---
Also, if you're losing a VNI every week you're clearly not flying it properly. If you fly it properly and warp off when someone non-blue shows up in local you might lose a VNI a *month*.
---
We should ask them to include a section for every undefended structure that dies so no one will feel left out.
---
Just about to start, anyone have a referral code?
---
I never commented on the strategy, I just follow the strategy that our fc's determine they want to do.  I am just your normal f1 pusher.  Good or bad is always in the eye of the beholder.
---
Killahbee said on TiS specifically said they will look for situations where they feel they can win, where our form ups are a bit weak.  And avoid the fights where they cannot.
---
You don't have to be 100% hardcore to talk eve 24/7. I'm what i would consider a pretty casual eve player and i love talking about eve with people quite a bit.
---
Does this mean you've made $75,000 off a 36 page book about stealth bombing in Eve-Online?
---
Can't wait to read your "quitting EVE because X" post in a few months.
---
You think mid grade slaves would have worked?
---
But having access to a site that gives about 100k bounty and can be done in a smaller ship for a challenge literally is not infringing on any other game play. Also it would be a blast to hunt frigates / destroyers in null in other frigates and destroyers. I would not dock up when a fair fighter came I would fit to pvp. There is literally no down side to this. Carrier pulpits won’t bother with a Sansha s refuge it is not worth it. Meanwhile all small ship pve players are stuck to staying in highsec where you have 1-4 anoms in a system and tons with nothing. The index system is really cool but not available to those of us that don’t enjoy flying a ship that goes 300ms
---
Love it. When compared with other mmos, the class that taunts is also usually the tank. What you said here makes sense to me
---
&gt; a moon-siphon
---
Literally irrelevant. The process is literally this:
---
1) Structures have now one more state (like low power), hidden in the code. Name it the tax state.
---
2) The state is TAX NPC or TAX PLAYERCORP{Corp Name}
---
3) When you anchor the deployable belonging to {Corp Name} successfully in 5 days, the citadel's state change from TAX NPC to TAX PLAYERCORP {Corp Name}
---
4) When a can spawns in your asset safety system, it has one additional state. It tracks the tax state of the citadel it came from, at the time of death.
---
5) When you retrieve it from the asset safety system in lowsec, the already-calculated-by-game-design money goes to the wallet of the {Corp Name}, rather than the NPC Corp. Easy peasy. 
---
&gt; as people could just use altcorps to asset safety tax-evade on their own structures.
---
Wait! So I will use an altcorp to destroy my own citadel, sending my stuff to asset safety system, under the effect of my own deployed mobile structure, so that I can pay 15% asset safety tax to my altcorp, when I retrieve my own items from the asset safety system? You don't realize how dumb you sound, just to stretch your points due to hatefulness, do you?
---
&gt; others like Suitonia that represent groups not nullsec affiliated.
---
Lol it must be even more saddening to realize he endorses me then. Too much hate mate. Bad for your health.
---
glad you're enjoying the game, welcome to eve.
---
Not sure it has to effect total numbers of sites big time ratters are not going to bother with a site that gives 100k bounty.
---
How would a low SP relatively poor player operate in a wormhole? Do you make money in J-Space or outside of it?
---
Yes true sec and war index that is my issue currently there is no way for someone that enjoys the smaller ships to have access to these mechanics just seems silly.
---
&gt;But having access to a site that gives about 100k bounty and can be done in a smaller ship for a challenge literally is not infringing on any other game play.
---
Cool. So why should CCP devote time and resources to extending content that's already available in highsec to nullsec?
---
&gt;The index system is really cool but not available to those of us that don’t enjoy flying a ship that goes 300ms
---
VNI goes 1100m/s, btw.
---
&gt;Also it would be a blast to hunt frigates / destroyers in null in other frigates and destroyers. I would not dock up when a fair fighter came I would fit to pvp.
---
All of this indicates that you're a new pilot whose only experience with nullsec is just flying through it.
---
When I still played it seemed like you were the only goon fc active in autz. Still surprises me they ran you out
---
Oh, geez Rick.
---
Why you posting shit under my name again?
---
I am going to report you to the internet police.
---
And you must be a old jaded crab that does not care about this game actually attracting a new crowd to keep it alive. Guessing your next post will be “eve is dead”
---
Hot take.
---
What is the reason why all content being available in null is da bad thing? Because you an fly s vni is not a good argument
---
yes they are, you don't balance by the lowest common denominator
---
You're reading it wrong. I'm saying they are precious now because they spawn the sites you want infinitely. Shitty systems are shitty because they infinitely spawn sites you don't want. A little more equity might make shit systems slightly better and good systems slightly worse, meaning people move around - just like they have started doing since the ore and later combat anom changes
---
It's not about the value of individual systems but making empires spread out.  In fact, it would achieve spreading out empires while keeping the relative value of systems, which from a game design standpoint is honestly brilliant
---
No, I've been outspoken about how EVE needs to attract new people. But adding low-level combat sites to null is not the way to do it. It's completely counter to the way progression is set up in this game and it's only going to attract carebears like yourself who have no business being in null.
---
See your close minded “null is for me and others like me”
---
Same reason the ore anom changes worked. It forces people to spread out. 
---
The best systems would still be the best systems probably. They just wouldn't be able to support as many people ratting simultaneously
---
Because it makes it harder to find higher-level content. And also fucks with the progression in the game. There's a very clear progression from high to low to null. Adding highsec content to nullsec fucks that up.
---
That's a sad excuse for releasing and hyping unfinished content.  Maybe they should call it games-as-a-service!
---
Nullsec is for people who aren't going to cry over a 20Mn loss.
---
How? After being in high sec for a while you want to go play pve with the risk of pvp. You just spent a year maxing our your frigate skills and now want to take the next step. It is a progression.
---
Yep, then they sat around while Provi got kicked around until they could snipe the forts. "Technically not taken from Provi" lol
---
And this would not replace any high level content it would supplement it. A big Corp could do ratting ops and include the new guys rather then making them follow with a salvager.
---
if you don't want to fit them, it does matter.
---
There is no 'between", RC and Spectre Fleet are working together. Spectre tried to cover RC's Sov takeover on Saturday.

---
Oh btw... Welcome to Providence! Imperial Dreams is recruiting!
---
If you spent a year maxing frigate skills only to realise that frigates aren't useful for PvE in nullsec then that's nobody's problem but your own.
---
I'm not sure what other people's reaction to the ore anom changes were but the people I was mining with just started mining out the smaller belts instead of focusing on the two biggest ones. It didn't spread us out at all.
---
That is disgusting yet I am also aroused. Thank you
---
TBH I interpret that as him saying we're going to take fights that are actually feasible and not just feed.
---
Nobody does ratting ops because only the newest of the new pilots can't solo sites.
---
you got my vote olmeca
---
Or it creates a situation where you can hyper farm in one part of null and screw people in other parts of null out of their respawns.
---
Just because you like to play this game a way does not mean that that is the only way
