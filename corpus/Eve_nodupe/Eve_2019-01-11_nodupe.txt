One other thing is that if a pvp entity rolls into you within an hour or so (depending on their activity levels) then they'll probably kill your citadel just before it anchors - unlikely to happen but be wary

---
I can kill the people who try to jam me. I like it alot.
---
Tbf if he ran c2 sites the isk is Teri le. C3 are 200m an hour or more if you aren't bad, C4 are the same, c5 and c6 are drastically more isk/hour
---

---
A c4-2/5 allows easy logistics and endless c5 sites if that's what you want 
---
I focused on salvaging mostly in my early months but ive come to love abyssals since their release
---
Taking advice from strangers on reddit is, though. 
---
"Your post takes two minutes too read, most people are lazy idiots and can't spend two minutes focusing on anything"
---
It's only not good idea if you mind suicide gankers.
---
I LOVE CCP! CCP! CCP!
---
Everyone that has been waiting patiently for the stars to align so that we can dog pile your ass.
---
I'd say you can probably do the same thing, but the T1 Harb isn't going to be as good at it as the Narb, especially if you shield fit (personally I don't know *why* you would do that but whatever).
---
Yes. She missed a pod once. Once.
---
Well we could give her tools to see how creative she can get. But if it's just suicide ganking own members. Seems kinda uncreative.
---
I think I know why the OP left.  Thin skin...
---
Doesn’t it? I know you can write down the manual key and re-enter it if you get a new phone, is that not essentially a recovery key?
---
I mean we're pretty limited with two stickies, and also the fact that no-one reads them. If we deleted every repost or complaints thread there would be no content posted at all.
---
Really the subreddit is what it makes itself, as mods we can't (and shouldn't) dictate 100% of the content and there's only so much you can do in forms of balance to prevent a sub going one way or another.
---
The best thing users can do is use those voting arrows and post content they want to see so others are encouraged to do the same.
---
Whilst we can enforce some ideals to an extent, there's no way to be subjective as "this is a known issue and your opinion is invalid." or "this post is too negative"
---
The actual solution - CCP could hire more community team members instead of laying them off, so that this dedicated fanbase actually gets the communication it deserves.
---
To know more is to damn your sanity.

When the Input Broadcasting ban was first announced, I sent an email to Peligro, Falcon, Fozzie, Seagull, and someone else, asking to sit down and clarify some of the fuzzy areas in the ban, and to act as a translator of sorts for CCP to get the message across for what they wanted to ban. Radio silence.  
---
  
---
I have volunteered to hunt bots for ages. Radio silence.   
---
I've offered to solutions to problems that have existed for a while only to be met with radio silence.  
---
I started playing just after the Incarna riots. I foolishly believed that CCP could change for the better. But I've become a pessimist in this game because of CCP, not in spite of.  
---
I see the threads as an unfortunate symptom of an underlying sickness, one that CCP would rather ignore than deal with; that is that they are unable to take outside advice or feedback if it does not come from an Icelander. There was an article by an EVE player who might've been former CSM which outlined it, and it's an Icelandic phenomenon, not a CCP phenomenon.  
---
Is she goonswarm alt or why does she hang around Delve? Thats cool tho, Gas Factory loves goons &lt;3
---
Back-up the key you enter into you 2FA code generator. Its not perfect, but its a solution.
---
Try and detect the voice synth though. 
---
It's because you live in Delve
---
r/eve is an echo chamber for people that shit post and generally jump on the band wagon of CCP hate or hate towards one of the 3 main factions (Goons, TEST and 'The North'). 
---
On occasion you get a 'feel good' story but not too often. Welcome to Eve, it's always been toxic and always will be pretty much by design, for better or worse
---
How many times has this turned into income revenue for your corp? Or are you just bleeding ISK to corp-hoppers? 
---
A+ meme
---
Try and find a couple of other guys/gals in your corp/alliance and go try out some small gang content or blobs. Honestly just chillin and talking to corpies on comms is good enough too.
---
so, the bazar isnt the same you say? Right.
---
Did you forget to tell them about the time Francis himself made me cry for whelping a fleet? Dude is a straight asshat, embarassed me in front of the whole alliance for losing 25m isk ships. Pathetic.
---
Challenge accepted.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
nah bro your just in the wrong corp. join a newbro friendly null alliance
---
I agree with you. I'd like to say I have done it all in Eve. High/low/null sec missions, market pvp, freightered supplies, freighter ganking, FW, H/L/N incursions, lots of PVP, lived in WH for years, mined in barges, mined my way up to four rorq miners, owned (owns 2, now) titans, VNI/carrier/super carrier ratting, chained belt rat spawns, dread bombed, been dread bombed (survived and died from them), survived tidi and much more. I love this game and I like being able to afford capital ships. I don't understand all the hate. 
---
Well we just help new players get started. We don't expect them to generate income for us, all we want is for them to get on coms and join the action.
---
We dont immediately hand it to them, they need to get into our base first. It acts as good motivation for players to get their asses out of Highsec.
---
bro i think your just in the wrong corp. t1 frigs can dish out allot of punishment to other players if flown correctly. larger ships dont win the fight, better pilots do. chances are you joined a nonsense high sec corp. 
---
sounds like a newbro friendly nullsec corp would be more your speed
---
Is CCP truly that shitty? When we have developers like EA, Ubisoft and Bethesda that people would say just as bad things about, be it their customer service, game quality or being in touch with the player base, I would go as far to say that that are developers that are way more popular but yet way more shitty.
---
There have been many CCP foray's into null sec, you can see the ISD's warping around occasionally and followed one into lowsec last year.
---
They had a christmas roam in 2017:

Your point about the people being the fun, isn't that the point of all online sandbox games? If you took the people out of Fallout 76, GTA Online or Elite Dangerous those games would be a lot more boring so I feel you would have to make that decision with all the online sandbox games because they all have downfalls in either content, bugs or amount of time spent vs enjoyment.
---
key word "MAY" inb4 CCP considers a 1% decline in r/eve posts about broken local a sign that the issue is not as bad as it seems and they keep the old system...
---
Lol the best is the comment below that post saying that EVE is 5% new stuff, 95% fixing, 4 years ago. Now the complains are all about how it's 95% new stuff and only 5% fixing. EVE dies in different ways all the time apparently.
---
TBH most of the T1 battlecruisers seem to be very underrated and underappreciated. They're quite good, and most of them brawl quite well (the Harbinger in particular, IMO, is an excellent brawler when running a buffer-tanked dual web fit).
---
That being said I submit the Drake.
---
Not a newbro, but definitely was new to null bloc life when I wasn't part of the help. 
---
Used the 100% safe space to run DEDs back to back to build a nest egg when I had time to play outside of school/work
---
Enjoyed not being kicked when I didn't login for a while
---
Used my nest egg to try reactions in safe space with logistics handled for me, then later used my own structures to save on hauling costs. 
---
Being paid to scan wormholes is nice since I actually enjoy scanning
---
Got rejected from all SIGs that have actual content because I cannot suffer through all the blue ball fleets. 
---
Deployed my pvp character back to low sec to play with friends while making my activity requirements suicide ganking
---
Nothing that has been allegedly dying for so long could really be dying. Eve is undead.
---
&gt; got hooked on flying Logi (though I still suck) 
---
What makes you think you suck? 
---
too late, it's already a feature, CCP forgets about it the moment it's implemented, it won't be changed for at least another year or two... it's not a bad feature though but needs work, like a lot of things in eve...
---
I still haven't found an Omen fit that I can settle into, it either doesn't seem to have enough DPS or enough tank. Any tips?
---
I had some bady in low sec try and jam me with their rook, instead of me going for their frigate alt I chased them down. 
---
Was nice BTFO that faggotry. 
---
Hmm. Would stealth bombers be good enough in a similar role if paired with a guy in a freighter to scoop the loots?
---
from what I've heard, timer was over a POS, Test got caught with pants down and fed some caps over it to northen super fleet
---
just a fun little 'gudfite' brawl 
---
Uncle Nancy is busy dunking
---
Test is busy spinning
---
Timer was for a POS. TAPI had carriers on their fort, we dropped dreads on them, they warped their dreads in, we dropped titans supers and carriers 100km or so off. They died. Subcaps are still skirmishing, caps are out. 
---
I have not played in over 3 years, I am currently docked in a station that is in null and owned by Goons. is the only way to get my stuff from the station to join their alliance and move it? I am docked but have no permissions. 
---
I hate r/Eve toxicity more than anyone. But I disagree with this post. Think of it this way.
---
Eve is great and all but it comes from the fact that it's the only game in its genre. We just love the genre. If Eve had competitors, the current iteration of the game is bad enough (bugs, balance issues and more) for many people to leave without a glance. We play it because we are in love with the genre, and there is no alternative.
---
Meanwhile, CCP knows it and has kept the investment to Eve at a minimum level for a long time to optimize profits. This means, unless an issue causes a huge outrage affecting CCP's bottom line, it probably won't be fixed.
---
r/Eve serves as a medium for this outrage to occur. So at least every once in a while we can get some stuff fixed. The game is better off with all the negativity on this subreddit.
---
The most disappointing thing about r/Eve negativity is not what it does to the game but what it does to content creators who tend to get shit on for one reason or another. Perhaps we should be more lenient on shitting on each other. But us shitting on CCP is what keeps the game playable.
---

---
wat
---
They always have, as not having a damage cap gives you an incentive to put more assets on grid.
---
There is a good reason to put 20 dreads on a stick to one cycle it.
---
There is no reason to ever put dreads on a fort outside some very specific cases.
---
I don't like to post here cuz fuck the shitty attitude of the vocal people who are just a minority of eve players (if they even play), so I stick to mostly zkill meta posts. If you whittled down negative posts to being allowed just one day a week it would either kill the sub or revitalize it, hard to say.
---
Bums on seats Vs concurrent is significantly different to what you think, and what it used to be pre injectors Id estimate that concurrent bums in seat is in the region of 5000 and that's being conservative. 
---
Yep only 5000 people are actually logged in at the same time... Kinda pathetic really.

What would you know about bushido you.you.you nullseccer!
---
I would say more like a month. I think it took me a few times of shaking my head, maybe assuming things decloaked, etc; before realizing this was happening. Its a pretty nasty bug too and has definitely cost me a few ships (ill even blame losses it didn't on it haha)  
---
But yeah, the fact there has been no official word on this is kind of annoying.
---
This is literally the shitty bittervet attitude that the OP is talking about. It's not a sickness, the game is not dead or dying, and there is not radio silence.
---
Sorry CCP was not receptive to your snowflake solutions and whatever crusade you have against them for not listening to you does not deserve you blaming them "being icelandic". 
---
Fuckoff with your toxic posting, and maybe play a different game if you aren't happy. 
---
I'm not going to get into a pissing contest with you about what we do for the people around us, that is inherently narcissistic, which goes completely against the reason I do things for others. On the other hand, you just proved my point for me, so thanks for providing even more for the people around you.
---
Because we have more time to see the ship just sitting there idle. More time to gawk at a shiny new skin.
---
I know! so many goddamn high-grade snakes have likely past by without the owner screaming "Fuck! why didn't I use the tactical bookmark!"

---
Funnel blunt!!
---
How will they spin this one. Cant wait to hear it. 
---
True I forgot I started salvaging with a thrasher lol.
---
In other words, you do nothing but complain. Got it. That's all you had to say. 
---
I go through an Eve phase every year or two where I purchase some gametime, try to relearn the game, join a corp and try to get involved.
---
Every time without fail I start to enjoy myself and jump on forums to dive a bit deeper into mechanics etc only to see this bombardment of people bitter at a game they've been playing for 10 years.
---
One corp I joined even used to say things like "we don't play Eve" as some kind of weird inside joke in their chat. You could never do anything with them.
---
It's a very weird community. I still have an interest in the game, hence why I lurk here - but yea I agree with you. It's disheartening.
---
Horde avatars. fuckin 2019 lol.

And you have a burning need for a 9mm bullet to enter your headspace.

I'm doing t1 abyssal solo in a retribution, 15 minute per site, ranging from 20m up to 500m the run (thanks precursor destroyer skill) just buy a big stack of t1 filaments and go hunting in a 200m frig!

That should make visualizing it even easier, and more clear as a learning tool.

wow. PGL really is delusional about Horde.
---
he's talking about a Horde a year ago.  but the Horde a year ago and the Horde now are vastly different in strength and capabilities.
---
nor is test, hell i'd say TAPI is weaker now than a year ago due to their growing reliance on Imperium.
---
and if they think they gonna contest Geminate,  well...they're gonna find that the north isn't as divided or weak as they seem to think.
---
defensively...Horde alone can deal with Test. (defense being easier than attack)
---
and if they need to push back,  TAPI seems to forget who Horde has next door, the rest of PANFAM. 
---
and knowing what appeals to newbeans,  the idea of defending an invasion is the perfect way to keep them active,  not sure Test is ready to make newbeans excited.
---
100% agreed. Damage caps were utterly idiotic...
---
Wait what, TAPIs grand plan is to run interceptor fleets, then counter form the fleets that form to kill the interceptor fleets? This is some dinobrain level shit.
---
Nicer than mine - I've just got the tray a sandwich came on. To be fair, it was an unusually nice sandwich tray and it fit perfectly into my stash box. 
---
All the things!  Started off doing explo, lots of standing fleet pvp, it took a while to skill into bigger fleet doctrines but those are fun now. But yes, I do a LOT of VNI ratting but its how I also get my Netflix kick in. I was doing weekend moon mining a bunch until my ratting skills got to earning 3x that per hr. Nearly skilled into a carrier now so I have that going for me which is nice.
---
"just for funsies, no big deal, everything was insured, thanks NC for playing on this arranged Fite"

Do you think Mittens will loan him the Spinmaster 9000?

That used the same tech as Chrimson Harvest. Are you saying this problem only started mid December?

Crappiest proof for the crappiest failing alliance!
---
Two certs gets you three queues.
---
You buy and activate a second one. Activating two MCTs will allow you to train all three character slots.
---
Oh my god. I am not and nor have I ever referenced playerbase numbers. I’m talking about the playerbase having a growth mindset where they adapt and move forward instead of crying about changes.
---
out of curiosity...how much do goons charge to hire you to wipe out gotg? o.0
---
No, this "I hate it because I actually love it" bullshit is completely stupid. It's entitled, armchair-game-dev bullshit. I get that everyone's a critic, but this sub is full of people bitching about relatively inconsequential shit, and expecting the world to feed them with a golden spoon, except they can't even articulate the actual problem, much less rationalize a workable solution.
---
You fall in love with a game, invest a lot of time and effort into it, your character, etc. and then grow bored/bitter, and then blame the game and developers for your own shitty attitude and a sunk cost fallacy. Either accept the game for what it is and find appreciation for it, or accept that your not happy and move on. 
---
Do you stand in front of a painting at a museum  and then hold a grudge against the artist once you grow bored of looking at it? No. You move on with your fucking life, and come back to appreciate it again later when you want.

---
Go POS timers.
---
YEah they use asic miners these days.
---
You have a few options.
---
Asset safety: Select everything in your hangar and asset list, then right-click asset safety. It will automatically be queued by CCP to move to the nearest lowsec station, but can only be retrieved at a percentage cost of the value.
---
Sell everything on contract: Make a contract and set the value based on [https://evepraisal.com/](https://evepraisal.com/). Tell people in local what you're doing or hit up 1DQ and do the same.
---
Apply to a corp in The Imperium (Goonswarm, Initiative, Bastion, Tactical Narcotics Team, Get Off My Lawn) and stick around. Don't be a shithead and just join to get your stuff out. You will be shot.

Here are the first trauma beams just before the above-mentioned "They died." happened. What a beautiful game we play.
---
I mean, I agree that it's important to fix problems, but most of the problems are ones that only bittervets like me notice if I'm being honest.   
---
Bots are an issue, chat is an issue, but a lack of newbros is a much bigger issue - and if all of them are driven away by our oceans of salt, the game will die far faster than otherwise.
---
Still good fight tho we got some back (subcaps), thanks NC and Horde
---
Why would they need to go? Injectors are the sole reason I could start fresh and go straight into exploring and solo PVP and create some other content than running lvl4s missions for days while my Lvl Vs skills train to just be able to win some pvp fights. 
---
Vets should KNOW better to be good at the game because they spent time learning with their actual brains, not their char's brain. You get good with time because you get good at managing your modules, mechanics, cunning with warp ins, spotting, scouting, etc. No just because you waited 9D in station training Thermodynamics 5
---
tapi just wanted to have a fresh start when the deployment officially begins by welping their member's capitals
---
uh, this is EVE 2.0, or rather like EVE 4.5, the game has changed so dramatically in the last 15 years, it's ridiculous. 2 years from now, you can expect just as much change as from 2 years ago to now. 
---
The question isn't "does anyone know", it's "does anyone care".
---
Will have to look into this Asset Safety thing, sounds like the easiest way for damage control at this point. Thanks for the info! 
---
How much time and money did they waste on Carbon?
---
The fact that this is already downvoted to 17% only 13 minutes after it's creation is a testament to how utterly retarded the average genome polluter on /r/eve is.
---
CCP is objectively garbage and works at a glacial pace, even just to change numbers in a notepad file. Not to mention their design choices, between skill injectors, excavators, citadels, asset safety, refineries, and the capital rebalance, they have put the game into an irrecoverable death spiral.

Looks like fate is encouraging you to join the Swarm. You could asset safety it but good luck evacuating it from whatever lowsec station it turns up in in 20+ days. Your best options are join or firesale.
---
But also, you play your part in why the community reacts so negatively - you're out and out exposed as someone who openly lies to the community

Need I bring WoD back up?

Don't be like that. EVE should have more players that take role playing this seriously. This kind of players create the stories and mystery of New Eden.

Test won the strategic objective, the north might have ended up a tad ahead on ISK war.

This is a pretty lame shit post.
---
I came down south for the sansha explo sites two years ago and it was the first time I made more than 20 million isk in a session. I felt like I’d never run out of isk because I had two hundred mill isk... hahah...However I knew I’d never see a dread or a titan by just exploring around and not making isk faster. After talking with Corp mates and when plex wasn’t 1.6b. I made 6 alpha accounts after a few more months of exploring I finally made enough plex to activate an account. After two months I had 5 account ratting at all times. At my peak I had 8 accounts. It was glorious at and other times I may have made more on VNI salvage from my alts buuuuut I was finally making billions. After getting bored with that I decided I really wanted dread to kill the pesky dread spawns. Got it, rarely use it but love it. Got bored wanted a carrier, got it then got bored wanted paladin and started running 10/10s and making close to net profits that I did while multi boxing. Just finished Marauder V and love running DEDs in two years I’m accumulated about 45m SP. I made the decision to truly start training/saving for a titan. I started capital ships IV today and can sit in a Titan in 2-3 months. I should be able to save enough in that time. I’ve sworn off eve twice in this time, but i keep coming back like a bad ex girlfriend.
---
We lost caps, well done. 
---
"There is never a reason except when there is a reason."

I just recently started playing, and I'm wondering what the best way to get really involved in everything that's talked about. I've completed all of the career agent missions, done the tutorial, and I've been mining and killing hostiles. But I'm not really sure how to "get out there" and experience more. Thoughts?

I watched the subcap stream for a good while, looked like a solid slug fest.

To late, the Horde is super content hungry now.

Yeah,  good thing the POS was saved. 
---
How is GOTG still alive? Do they still have friends?
---
"Ha, we made you undock, we win!"
---
The loudest voices on the internet tend to have the most extreme opinions. It comes with the territory. Game developers listen to trends and analyze stats gathered from play. They don't often base decisions on the latest Reddit rant or shitpost; unless it's some kind of big bugfix. 
---
Was it?
---
It's typical of the broader community of players of pretty much any MMO. I think it has more to do with an individual's attitude than the game itself.
---
Nice as always Jack, need to hop on coms listen to you play GEEETAR again sometime haha 
---
One ahead of you

Dangerously close to losing accounts permanently when they can't pay for plex from their wallets again

I was watching people @you in local, but not seeing you say anything, and wondered what was going on, and why there was so little spam.
---
When I realised it was because I had muted your entire alliance some time ago (and forgotten), the feeling was equivalent to finding a surprise $20 in my jeans. :)
---
I usually avoid gaming communities because of how bad shitposting is and the overall whiny vibe... rather just play the game. Eve is a lot different in how IN GAME people are really cool and even if they blow up newbs they tend to throw some isk at them and some helpful advice. But r/eve is where the usual gamer bullshit comes out. I'm convinced most posters here have long since quit the game and come here just to fling their shit at each other. There is such a stark disconnect from what is in game vs this sub.    That said, there are some good an interesting posts now and then which is why I bother to come here at all.
---
You see, all of TEST's clothes fell off.  And they're scrambling to get their knickers back on, but it's too late. I've seen everything.

Stop signing up with the same username and password to ISK selling sites..... really stop it.... this is 99.999995% of perceived "hacked" accounts.

You're asking the wrong question. EVE is no fun when all your friends are alts. Be social.

Wow. In all these years playing eve, I have seen some shit posts. This much good sir is by far now at the #1 spot on my list of worst shit posts in my /r/eve history. 
---
yea I fucked up
---
You're right, we wouldn't stand a chance without those 40 goon ishtars
---
*your posting*
---
I know TEST is going to love this. Well done!
---
 YEah they use asic miners these days 
---
That was last we station from over 5 years ago that was meet with spectismism back then before skill injectors and alpha accounts. Alpha doesn't pay into the prior comment. But less subbed. And hisec has been dying to the boom of null sec. The question is when does the bust happen.
---
FUCK TESTICLES, HOPE THE TTT GOES DOWN
---
sad part is losing 100 capitals doesn't really count as much of a "bump" these days for larger alliances.  just a matter of moving the ore and building 1 or 2 less titans.
---
&gt;And yet I get onto the CSM, without being on the Goon lists...
---
Not for CSM 13 number 10 on the imperium ballot, yes you likely got some outside votes as well. 
---
It's ok your campaign doesn't start until Saturday. This doesn't count.
---
Well TNT are already farming horde 
---
I know Anyanka as the solo ganker who can single-handedly engage Amarr trade hub in thrilling excitement and sell mining permits at the same time.
---
Bit of an understatement
---
Whats new 
---
Good fight all.  The Subcap fight was a ton of fun. 
---
&gt; defensively...Horde alone can deal with Test. (defense being easier than attack) 
---
Can they though? Has there been a single fight during this entire campaign where Horde have beaten TEST and haven't called for NC/PL/BL for assistance? 
---
I love eve, until I play it for a while, then it becomes a job, then I win at eve, but then I lose at eve again because I forget about the job part and remember the fun; then I play eve for a while...
---
That fight felt incredible after the blue balls yesterday.  I hope everyone had a good time.  
---
gf Test.
---
U
---
that is a nice screenshot
---
It's love not hate. EVE is a PvP game and she's getting them involved. Also, with the many nerfs to suicide ganking, frigates are the biggest target she can take down solo.
---
Yea but I work two jobs, have a baby on the way, don't have time to be social hah.
---
Well, as a kiter and in the current meta the Wolf primarily seems to exist to dick over Slicers/Retris, since either way you have dank resists vs laser EM/therm lock and against Retris you can load Phased Plasma to hammer the T2 Amarr resist hole (which is generally thermal but sometimes EM).
---
Other than that however the bigger issue is just that the arty Svipul can pretty much be fit out in a near-identical fashion and ends up being almost totally superior. Sure it isn't as absurdly fast (dual nano Wolf goes almost 4100 m/s cold) but that speed is double edged given server tickrate is 1/sec, and the potential for extra optimal on the Svipul- and the defensive web- is a really big deal.
---
I dunno about brawl Wolf though I can't really into 2-mid brawlers.
---
well.....yes and no.
---
they not alive. just no one awake to finish their cits due to timezones.
---
No idea, I don't pay attention to Delve it's fine without me. Sorry to burst your bubble.
---
I think you're about to bite off more than you can chew.
---
To be fair, we asked them to undock yesterday. 24 hours to form up is a bit absurd. But they can keep feeding.

he's going to have to redo his SOTA
---
I mean tapi also has a coalition? So coalition vs coalition. 
---
Did fox news write this report? 
---
Missing all the dreads tapi lost hahahaha

I want the real /u/concernedeve back...

---
Well I’m currently an alpha, and am training an alt for Logi that can only fly the burst, sub par scythe and navitas, so I can’t fly ospreys or basilisks that are for stratops, so I usually resort to doing ewar for those and Logi for standing fleet. Also, I’ve only recently been flying Logi for a little while. I think I started actually flying Logi like three months ago, so I don’t know what to do half the time.
---
Basically only B52s; Long Range Phoenixes that can out range the citadel.
---
Step 1: Go to your nearest Low Security system.
---
Step 2: Jump from High Sec to Low Sec
---
Step 3: Warp around to FW plexes
---
Step 4: Rinse and Repeat until you die
---
Step 5: 'Start a Conversation' with whoever kills you
---
Step 6: Ask for ISK and if you can app to corp to fly a griffin
---
According to tests current Zkillboard I see no dread losses, just 1 carrier loss
---
that's exactly what I said
---
ok
---
Rofl really you still think I am give myself up -  what you already lost nighbl4de with the same thing I said before.  Know I am good 
---
Go look at the other posts. All 50 of them
---
Sure, it will come down to coalition vs coalition in the end I'm not doubting that, just curious to his point of Horde being able to defend solo vs TEST
---

So, how about instead of another boring, pointless, bitch list, you offer up something constructive. Please, just whining sound so very... whiny.
---
Got a T shirt. Clearly winning.
---
Probably not to be honest, although I think password reuse is definitely the main issue. There are tons of leaked credential lists out there, invariably the ISK sellers would be cycling through all of these looking for someone who happens to have an EVE account. 
---
who streamed this?
---
I have no idea, was fun, GF to all. I'm super drunk, was a good fight! Eve ROCKS!
---
I fucking lol'd.
---
I'm not at a full year yet, but I will be later this month. I joined the game around the end of January last year - ran the tutorial and career agents, did the SoE arc, packed my stuff and joined Brave. Got killed in HED-GP, deathcloned over to our staging Fortizar and started my life as a Brave Newbie.
---
The early days were undoubtedly confusing, I still wasn't sure what I was doing. The (older) tutorial system didn't prepare me at all for the depth and breadth of Eve. I had enough ISK to buy my own ships without needing the Brave Dojo's assistance (though they did offer) and my first couple of weeks were spent doing belt ratting in a Catalyst and a Vexor. Once I'd had enough of watching a rat BS die agonisingly slowly, I switched to Explo. Explo gave a much better return.
---
Eventually, I was confident enough to join Brave's stratops, flying in a tackle Atron (and dying a lot) and then a Vigil. I felt useless, honestly. But over the next few fleets I picked up quite a lot of new information, and I set my eyes on the role that is always wanted, always useful and extremely simple to get into - Logi. Flying a Scythe and then an Osprey, I'd found my place, I still felt overshadowed by the Basis, but I was no longer useless. That was the key, feeling useless is the #1 killer of motivation in new players, I feel.
---
In my place as a Logi pilot, I started joining our standing fleets more often and having fun PvPing around our space. Logi is *always* appreciated in standing fleets. I flew my Scythe and my Burst, and my Navitas and generally had a blast. Things kind of accelerated from there. I joined the Provi deployment, where I learned a ton about Entosis and how sovereignty in Eve works. After that ended, the war in the south picked up. I was in LK1K when the full might of the 'rest of Eve' sat on a Fortizar picking us off. I was there for the gruelling assault on the Y-J Fortizar where Legacy was ordered to "reship into anything with guns" as supercaps were picking us off one by one. To date, that was the hardest battle I've had a part in. Not even the next on the list eclipsed this battle where we were trying desperately to maintain a capchain while getting constantly neuted and warped off.
---
The next on the list... my first (and so far only) alarm clock op. I woke up at 4am, undocked in my Osprey from our staging Keepstar and bridged, just as the sun was trying to rise, into UALX-3. After LK1K, the first moments were not that impressive. It was only after the Titans had jumped that the scale of this fight became clear. As a subcap, this was a boring fight. We were picking apart disconnected caps (I got to drop a Warrior II on a titan!) while the big boys were duking it out. We had the INN stream in the background and one after the other, the titans fell. And then the node joined them.
---
The following week and a half were surreal. Hanging around with the entire coalition in the same comms channel, hell camping the near-mythical supercapital fleet of PL, eating up Eagles, Muninns, Scimis and the errant Revelation as they were logging in. It was a blast. Whenever something warped to the grid outside the bubbles, our probers were competing with the goon probers to see who could fleet warp tackle first. The hellcamp was a hell... of a time. And then that was over and soon after, the war.
---
We're in a relative quiet now, managing to krab, in between the bouts of near-ever-present content Catch and Impass provide. I can fly a Basi now and a Kirin. And somewhere along the line, I've got myself a Keres and a few bombers. I still have a ton of fun in Brave, both in and out of fleet. I've met incredible people, and found a special place in video games where 'Stay Classy' is more than a saying, it is law. I know a lot more about the game now, and I look forward to continue enjoying it.
---
But yeah, I do spin a VNI every so often.
---
7o
---
yeah the Wolf is a great Kite catcher. I don't kite with it. In fact, I use Suitonia's Wolf fit. Plated, AAR, MWD, Scram, Autocannons, 2.2k col, 3.9k-ish heated. 4.2 with a minor speed implant. Plenty enough speed to catch things like Garmurs and other kitey nano ships before they escape scram distance. it brawls well versus laser boats. 
---
The thing its extremely weak at, is fighting anything truly built to brawl, with the mids to support scram/web. Fed Navy Comets? Unengageable with a Wolf. The wolf doesn't Brawl other brawlers very well, unless theyre rocket fit. In that case, just load Barrage and out dps them. but blaster scram kiters? Arty scram kiters? Not my shtick.
---
So your query about brawl wolf? Its brawl engagement profile is tiny. Scram kiters, most actual brawlers, RLML's, drone boats, are death too you. the Wolf is difficult, and you have to cherry pick your fights with it.

You have to leave so much that you have to core up to mine it, but so little that it disappears  30 seconds into the next cycle
---
Ok so it's not just me.... I've been seeing this repeatedly for the last few weeks and thought it was just a need for me to update drivers or something...
---
Who?
---
I spend a lot of time in the Starcraft 2 community and it’s very similar. Same with planetside2 as well 
---
I think it’s common for reddit/ forums to be mostly toxic game vets. I see it often
---
Tip 1 - Drag your guns ontop (group them) of each other and you can fire them all at once
---
Can they? Yes. Do they have to? No. It's not called "Panfam" for no reason.
---
Yeah those things are what...100mil? look out!
---
&gt;The only side casuality was jamming fighters
---
*cries in Widow and GNI*
---
81 titans. That is kinda impres oh wait ain't 2016 nomore. 
---
Yo momma's so fat, she got stuck in the EVE gate, and now we can't return to Earth.
---
Wonderfully made and fun fleet concept.
---
Of course it does, that’s how representation works. I do not need to be a part of one group to represent that group. This is fundamentally how representative democracy works. My Congresswoman represents me in Washington, even though she’s a woman and of a different political party than I am.  I may not like what she does, but she’s there to represent the interests of me and the rest of her constituents. If she does a good job, she will listen to me even though we disagree. If she doesn’t, she will ignore me and just do whatever she wants. 
---
I haven’t been informing anybody, and I’ve been advocating for stuff that doesn’t benefit me or the folks I fly with pretty constantly. I’ve done a ton of work on the WH hic issue and the war dec stuff and neither of those things makes an ounce of difference to my gameplay. 
---
not my ship, posted it for a friend lol
---
This is going to be fun. Does he not realize that the Beans are hungry?
---
all hail POS timers! the true content makers of EVE

Can my cousin beat up your cousin? Sure. Will I stand by and watch if that happens? Nope! Gimme that chair, I'm going in too.
---
-EVE politics in a nutshell
---
You stole my name!!!
---
True. Actually a lot of the time it's "Fuck them! I want content too!!!" Like ravenous hounds to the dinner bell. 
---
&gt; Can they? Yes.
---
How? On max-forms TEST are able to outform Horde easily, even without doing that they've proven time and time again they're very well versed in subcaps, winning fights outnumbered.
---
Even if TEST don't move super fleets to Oijanen, would Horde drop their super fleet on TEST, even if it was a guarantee that no other parties (goons, INIT, SNUFF) would join the fight? I don't think so.
---
I genuinely don't see Horde being able to defend solo against TEST if it were to come down to it.
---
This is the thing - I never said I would be a better representative than anybody else. I said that I was representing their interests. But even then, the idea that I can't be a good representative of one area because I don't live there is dumb. That's like saying a woman can't represent men in a legislative body, or that a person of one race can't represent people of another.  The entire point of representation is listening and passing on concerns. You don't need to be a member of a discrete group to pass that groups concerns on or to advocate on their behalf.
---
As for a single example where I advocating nerfing our playstyle to boost another? The CASB nerf for FAXes and Rorquals. I pushed for an even harder nerf for FAXes. As for other stuff, half the stuff on my campaign website would drastically change the playstyles of me and my coalition, from getting rid of local as an intel tool, to nerfing asset safety, to capital rebalancing to make capitals easier to kill - all of that stuff is on there to try to make the game better, and often at the expense of big groups like mine. 
---
I've never ignored feedback from the folks I ask it from, even if I disagree with it. 
---
How about instead of posting more stupid shit in the future you neck yourself? 
---
This place is, and has always been, a cesspool of a forum. Not even just here, reddit in general. 
---
Bring back POSs!!!!
---
Had a Dread in EX6 that I was going to drop in Brave staging for a fight. Realized I had forgotten my cap boosters back home like a complete nub. One neut in system, a little Brave newblette. I convoed him, and asked if he could pick me up a batch of Navy Cap Booster 3200's, and drop it in a container on our citadel. We haggled a price and off he went to get the goods. 
---
I paid him like an honorable bro, and a few minute later, here comes his hauler, and drops a can on the citadel. I slow boat my Moros out to the can, open it, and there they were, a stack of 3200's. the honorable exchange struck my feels, and I tipped him an extra 30m. 
---
Then proceeded to drop the Moros in GE- to kill Brave stuff. Have him as a good contact now, and he sent me a good contact notification too. Hopefully we can conduct more business in the future!
---
I came back after about 10 years and the only issue I have is with the whole pilot services. It really devalues time and effort we put in. Also, WHY THE F*CK DID I SELL MY 200MIL SKILL CHARACTER! 
---
Major regret
---
Fortunately you mined for the capitals and they were all insured so you came out ahead.
---
Pedantic overly specific idiot.
---
Reddit is kind of like any talk radio. It has no real impact on anything, ever, but you can turn it up real loud and pretend it's real.
---
Lol true
---
Are you fucking dense mate. TEST could walk all over horde without the rest of the PANFAM super umbrella. Like not even close.
---
A good war is good for the blood. It keeps everyone on their toes. GFs all around.
---
I half agree with you.
---
&gt;except they can't even articulate the actual problem, much less rationalize a workable solution.
---
Most posts *genuinely* outline where the problems, and where workable solutions lie. But this is often snowballed into growing frustration in the subreddit due to overwhelming feedback from the community being forgone in favor of mechanics, skins, buffs/nerfs that don't benefit the game as a whole. Though I agree this whole sub is bitchy, and perhaps people need to learn to roll with the punches, adapt and embrace change a little more. 
---
Your painting analogy isn't exactly correct IMO as games such as EVE aren't finished products like a painting in a museum. The analogous equivalent is if you appreciated the painting in the museum, then whilst you're looking at it the artist saunters over and adds a few more brushstrokes. You personally feel those brushstrokes were unnecessary and - to be frank - there were areas of the painting you felt needed the improvement more. This keeps happening and this leads to frustration, disillusionment and eventual abandonment. I can totally get that.
---
I find your lack of AAR... disturbing...
---
They don't outrange the citadel, max lock range on any non-carrier/supercarrier is 300km, citadel's lock range is 350km+. The point of the old B52 was to outrange the effective range of the capital neut, as the Phoenix can tank the damage of a Fortizar while not being neuted heavily, but the neuting rig made this significantly less effective. They are still okay if the citadel isn't rigged for the neut and/or you simply want to force your enemy to fight you far away so the citadel takes alot more time to apply damage, especially if it is forced to switch targets
---
sweet NC and PL undock scap fleet. i just wait, till goons move there scap fleet there. 
---
Congrats to Agent 872 on getting on the most kills this fleet, and SketchyManDan Willams and Cyanerd for tie-ing for second! Agent has won an abyssaled out Comet, and sketchy and Cyanerd won a Vexor Quafe Edition skin! Looks like it was a fun fleet, I'm just glad others had fun in my stead :)
---

---
How? They are pretty equal alliances in regards to size/systems held/ etc. [http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/memberCount](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/memberCount)
---
I would say that TEST has one better FC, and some other slightly better FCs. Horde however has spirit. I know that sounds cheesy as hell, but they always show up. It may be in stabbers, but they show up, every. damn. time. Wars are not won in a single battle, they are won over many battles. So the fact that on a super hype OP TEST can manage an outform doesn't really matter. The question is, can they do that every time. From what I've seen so far, the answer is no. 
---
Also, let him know to hold control and left click and drag Iock up whatever is in the area, instead of chasing down the drone to click lock. That gave me a bit of a chuckle 😂
---
The sticks still work, they phased out the nav/mining mods. They won't phase out the sticks until a citadel replacement (ya know something with a big ass shield) is created.
---
Only equaled by evictus standards
---
Please, continue to put words in my mouth, assume you know anything about me, and ignore what I say. Yeah that'll make you look like a credible person, I'm sure it will.
---
I'm terrible at AAR's, but I can give it a go. You have been warned
---
Just ask daddy NC to bring his titans and you can knock it down easy.
---
Oh wait.

---
Just to add to this, sort by distance and usr your overview instead of trying to lock them up when you're zoomed in so much that they're hard to hit when right-clicking.
---
It’s ok we are still waiting for that eviction you threatened us with. Lol
---
was having a discussion with a friend how long it would take PGL to fuck up and feed a cap fleet, less than 24 hours later. never change PGL.
---
I'm vaca but as far as I can see all they lost were some dreads.
---
So what?
---
78 dreads, 11 carriers and couple faxes.
---
I'm sorry, it's too late for you by now. You seem to have a sever case of dinobrain.
---
I think it's more of an "already replaced".
---
Very similar memes. I understand the confusion.
---
I see other subs do megathreads, where mods post a thread on an interval and related content is restricted to being posted on that thread. I know that's a decent amount of work for the mods :(
---
ah yes you are correct, sorry got confused what rhetoric was applicable in this case.
---
Well, Goons or Test.
---
Off. Where can I read / listen to this stuff?
---
ever seen all of Horde's capitals?
---
or for that matter, the number of capitals waiting in reserve every fight
---
Take it down then.
---
LMAO somebody actually posted that title right before you did buddy
---
This post is as optimistic as our dreadbomb today. 
---
Fox news? That's infowars level of fake news. 
---
IDK I think the Autism level is pretty high in test. Of the groups that could continue a grueling structure grind of a war to wipe a whole region, Imperium is the first, and test the second on the list I would make that has enough fools to want to keep logging in to bash with no resistance. Obviously that is a later point in the war, so your point still stands on continued hyping for regular fights, but I still see enough fire in the dinobros to keep hitting back. Not like they haven't bounced back from even a significant strategic defeat before.
---
Ok, gather round children, let Uncle Gothmog tell you all a story.
---
A few hours ago, in a galaxy of indeterminate distance from ours, there were a bunch of nerds with spaceships. One group, TEST Alliance, had a space installation which had been reinforced by their foes, the evil PANFAM Empire.
---
Anyway, we (PanFam) formed up, TEST formed too (unlike yesterday). We sent in subs (Apoc fleet, throwback to 2009), went under their fort, and TEST sent carriers. Tidi started. We escalated with dreads (popped my dread-alt's cherry), test counter-dropped their dreads, and then we dropped Titans, Supers, and Carriers at range, and proceeded to kill the TEST caps. 
---
Following this, we extracted caps (starting with dreads). Had some interesting times there, but the big boys made it out. We then proceeded to brawl our Apocs with TEST's Eagles.  Lost our Bhaals, but traded pretty well still, then bounced and extracted. Except for glorious Commander Killahbee, whose Apoc rode into the gates of Valhalla in a glorious burst of tackled fire.
---
Lots of tidi, but was fun. Especially after last night's blue balls. GF's all around :)
---
That's not actually quite as bad as I expected.

Don't get me wrong, it's an ass whooping, but I figured it was going to closer to D-G a few months back.

Winning with this is 50% the fit, but also 50% tactics. It requires also some great capacitor management. If you feel confident in that regard you could even replace the cap booster with a web.
---
Avoid fights with frigs in general, but if you do, try your best to minimise transversal. Despite the plating this ship goes just short of 2km/s which can be overheated to 2.7km/s. This speed can give you precious seconds in which to shoot someone before the get on top of you.
---
Be liberal with overheating, it has saved me a few times. This wont win every fight, but it is surprising sometimes. This fit works great in wolfpacks too 
---
CCP Falcon posts on this sub plenty often when there's quirky fun community stuff going on, yet can't manage to crawl out from under his rock when there's a massive bug affecting gameplay that CCP has yet to acknowledge.
---
If the sub exists only to moan endlessly about the game, does it really need to exist?
---
If the complaint is new or fresh and relevant  (ie someone found a new bug or exploit, etc) that’s one thing but maybe restricting things to a given day a bit would be a good idea. 
---
That's a nice [QR code](http://media.giphy.com/media/FA5nT3ApxRnEI/giphy.gif) you got there and a nice key.

Ore  prices are too  damn low!

Speaking in the first person there dasro?
---
Here, have this flower. I picked it off EVE's grave.
---
Weak spin, you can do better
---
Thought null pvp would be good. Right now I have 2 of my 3 charectors in a large null alliance making isk while I pvp with the third in lowsec and do exploration in null and wh space. 
---
Don't like big fleets. To much blue balls, tidi and docking. 
---
Let's hope this war bring plenty more fights and doesn't fizzle out!
---
I miss the glory days of LEX... When we had 20 people in fleet and TS was filled with farting noises.
---
The best advice I ever got was take a cheap ship, insure it to the max, jump to low or nulsec and do your best to lose it. Get killed. Try and kill someone.  This game is SO much better once you get used to blowing up. 
---
Convo the person who kills you. Thank them for the fight explain that you’re new and ask for tips. I did this exact thing years ago and in less than a week I ended up in a nulsec alliance flying with crazy bittervets and conquering my fear. 
---
Also, everyone says it but join a big nulsec alliance and just bask in danger for a week or two. That’s what I’m doing this time around and it’s great.  I think it would be less great if I was at all worried about dying.... so do the first part first. 
---
&gt;I said that I was representing their interests.
---
You imply by that you doing a semi-decent job at it, my argument is here not that you're not trying it's that you're the worse option because of experience. 
---
&gt; That's like saying a woman can't represent men in a legislative body, or that a person of one race can't represent people of another. The entire point of representation is listening and passing on concerns. 
---
God this explains so much, yes not having a woman to represent themselves and in place having to depend on a man to play proxy in terms of representation is kinda a bad thing. 
---
But let's explain this in a way even a Republican might get it if the Texas senator lived in new york for all his life, and went on holiday to Texas once do you think he would make a good senator? 
---
&gt; The CASB nerf for FAXes and Rorquals.
---
The Fax nerf having the side benefit that your in a coalition that benefits more from trading the caps and titans then one your fighting and that your in the coalition the mines in cyno range and therefore has the lowest tanking time on rorqs of all of them both are totally not accounted for in your suggestions for those specific nerfs. 
---
It's literally a boost to your playstyle that your pretending is a nerf here, I'm having an argument with a politician I known but could you like not lie to my a face, please?
---
&gt;from getting rid of local as an intel tool
---
we both know it's not gonna happen anyway. ( it's also a really bad idea ).
---
&gt; to nerfing asset safety
---
Nerfing asset safety, really the biggest group in eve wants a nerf to asset safety, yeah not shocked there, again you benefit the most from such a change because the big group has the ability to well defend their structures against any group, whereas the smaller groups will have to accept invasions can happen and will likely have to eat the structure losses and now eat the asset losses as well. 
---
&gt; to capital rebalancing to make capitals easier to kill
---
Biggest production flow wants to increase the capital loss rate for fights honestly I'm impressed by the balls it must take to tell me that it actively hurts your playstyle. 
---
I guess the jobs fit you I couldn't do that with a straight face.
---
Skill injectors, rorq mechanics, capital umbrellas ect.
---
Thing is we wil never see Horde vs Test 1v1 cause Gobbins would be stupid not to batphone every time.There no such thing as overkill in eve.That said I am curious too wheather test could take horde in an actual 1v1
---
One thing, don’t do any hisec incursions with a character that is in Horde, or any other alliance with wardeccers. Either drop Corp,  or make another character. 
---
Fighting in Hakonen with our caps vs NC/PL supers/titans was the best thing that happened to Goons in a long time. It taught us so much and it made NCPL vastly overconfident. I will be personally interested to see how Test responds to this. 
---
It really isn't that complicated or dramatic. Let's be real.
---
-The investors are probably quite hands off and let CCP do what they do unless there is some public outrage about something and they have a reason to get involved on a meta change level(let's be real here though, they probably give a fuck about the meta)
---
-Why would Rise or anyone else that cares as much about the game, it's well being, and players as much as he does present an idea that wasn't good for the well being of the game? And for simplicities sake let's not split hairs about differing interests because on the most simple level anyone that loves this game and has some basic logic and reason wants what's best for the well being of the game so that we can all enjoy it for as long as possible. I'm sure we would all love to see a healthy game state that drew in a larger player base. 
---
-I'm certain the process of getting something from idea to in-game feature involves quite a bit thought and consideration. I'm sure it involves loads of group discussion, brain storming, peer review, implementation testing, etc. No ones implying that one rogue dev risks his career to implement terrible ideas into the game. And since we've already acknowledged the presence of logic and reason in the process, I'm certain all ideas that come from any source that are void of that aren't even given a second thought. 
---
I don't think any one(or even more importantly, this community) is asking for CCP to add features that would break the game. Most reasonable suggestions come from community discussion and rationale about ways to implement things with as little disturbance to the game state as possible. The game state is constantly evolving, this is a complex universe of a game that's lived for a very long time and gone through countless iterations. 
---
Are people upset about one thing or another? Yes, they always will be. Change takes time and it takes even longer to see how that change impacts the game.
---
I understand skill injectors and cap umbrellas, but rorq mechanics? How does that effect krabbing?
---
You called me a narcissist because I stated the things I do to provide content for the people I like. I'm not to worried if you think I'm credible.

Ability to scale all most indefinitly being easly multiboxable/afkable. Combination of huge active tank+wetus to save drones and panic make survivability high and reletive risk low.
---
Income in EvE is essentially min-maxed and common knowledge ( A person playing this game for a few months can easily be crabbing in a super carrier making about 500 mil / hr. CCP are so distracted with other projects they completely neglected to incorporate new alliance level conflict drivers and shake up things to breathe life as players adapted to new mechanics. There is so much of this topic to expand upon but people who are afraid of change or just comfortable with how things are  will spew endless rhetoric garbage.

This is something I / we would do regularly but we had a bunch of threads about modbias or all kinds of other stuff so we toned it back a lot. It culminated in a 'mod strike' which was mostly just for fun but it kind of demonstrated a point as well (We still modded during the mod strike, we just let all the garbage low effort threads through).
---
Sadly the negative outburst prior to that 'strike' burned a lot of us out. Chevis outright stepped down and many others needed a break for awhile. I got very busy in real life so while I'm still pulling my weight on the team I'm not insanely active like I was for the last year and change. Two new mods were pulled in to sort of pre-empt that but at the end of the day it takes a lot of time to integrate them into the *bizarre* mod situation r/eve has going on. It's just not a problem we can chuck warm bodies at.
---
In a nutshell somethings that are routine at best for nearly every other subreddit are actually overly complicated for this one. The fact that this is neutral territory and there are so many opposed groups muddles the hell out of things. It gets even more complicated when you factor in the multiple groups are constantly brigading the sub - especially so as of the last couple of months.
---
tl;dr: I'm thinking about what to do.

People applying effort to their posts about it aren't the problem. However there has been a lot of what is effectively click bait with the topic. Personally I've been extremely busy IRL and only recently have I had enough time to really look at this problem. My fear is if I start doing quality control on the topic you all are going to fucking lynch me if I don't get it *exactly* correct.
---
Miss those days a lot - so many evenings doing stupid shit, but doing it it in a way that was fun and chilled that it was just enjoyable to turn up night after night and see what happened.
---
So many great people, from both blues and red - Core, Botia, Ashade, PBA, Hide, Silandra, Ristlin, Equinox to name just a few - and all the folks I shared a laugh with in fleet, evesterdam or fanfest.
---
Sadly I got busy in RL for a while, when I got chance to logon it felt too much like things and people had moved on and it just wasn't the same - I might have to drop by the next evesterdam if only for a few hours just for old times tho !

Looking at the MER, test are probably the only other group that, with a straight face, shrug and say 'already replaced'. 
---
I'm usually just here to read the shitposts of the highest quality. 
---
Stainguy and nazgul obviously.
---
test can form more than 2 fleets of dreads alone so if horde was gonna jump in their supers solo they'll probably lose it. that said horde vs test 1v1 is never gonna happen so
---
Cycle between sanctums and havens, drop MTU on each site (loot with hyper spatial / I-stabbed DST after session), sell escalation Bookmarks for 100mil. Will easily break over 500 mil an hour. 
---
Instead of bringing as many assets as possible, everyone brings the minimum amount of assets possible. Topsy turvy upside down world
---
Yes, you will get the option to extend  a queue or start the third
---
Isn’t the train time from newbie to a good super carrier 6 months? That’s a long time just so sit and wait and an injector gives about a week of skill training so that’s like billions of isk being shelled out just to get a super immediately. Krabbing isn’t easy, it’s probably just the most brain dead thing to do for some people. I mean, it could be fun, but brain dead.
---
Idk man in the time it takes you to warp to pos, get out of super and travel to make the bl and come back kinda makes you isk in the time you could have spent just continuing to rat (on average it’s at least 4-5 jumos away so takes like good 10min-15min in a pod m)
---
ARE YOU IMPLYING THIS MIGHT BE PROPAGANDA?!
---
It's a tricky problem. I don't think targeting negative posts is the correct method rather I think 'finessing' constructive threads is the right approach. There are a lot of things that can be done with removals or even just jumping into the comment section and doing what we can to keep a conversation productive. The issue is - for example - If I went a little bit too hard or, god forbid, made a mistake then suddenly I have multiple threads accusing me of simultaneously being a pro-goon shill and an anti-goon shill (this literally happened). Basically, people do not hesitate to fuckin lynch us here at the slightest misstep. It's the same problem I think you're talking about here but maybe I should just risk it and do what I feel is right anyways.
---
Kiddo? Really dude we are gonna get into this whole age bull crap that dominates NEET fights throughout the Internet?

---
in tyool 2019
---
The short answer is yes. They appear to be pushing quite hard for a 64 bit client as well as knocking out legacy code. Unfortunately one of their first major pushes in that direction backfired pretty hard (chat).
---
Damn it. Why was this the fight that happened? I was so ready for my first combat drops with my carrier &amp; Dread but no one showed up for the SkillU fort. 
---
Damnit TEST invite us to these fights, not blue balls.

Yeah, I can unfortunately see that happening after similar incidents in other subs. Maybe a Bug Report day or something to give people a place to vent and consolidate the issues.

Krabbing is easy and new players can easily be crabbing in VNI's (50mil - 60 mil) an hour without touching their keyboards on 25 minutes intervals. 
---
Step 1) Make a reddit thread about it so that people can come find you 
---
I see. Thank you
---
No, I said fighting with you about who does more for our people would be narcissistic. But clearly you're far more interested in furthering your narrative than actually considering the meaning of yours and other's words, so all of this is pretty much just a waste of my time.

The fact that they are being hypocrites doesn't counters the fact that the guy should be banned
---
TNT is hiding on edge of TKE lol
---
Y’all do any abyssal sites?
---
was the best part of the night
---
It's mostly our fault. We broke the meta completely open when we decided, hey, maybe we shouldn't violently shit down the throats of anybody who decides they want to do PVE in Eve, even if it meant sucking crok for cash. One thing led to another, and now, with elation, we a crustacean station, for your information.
---
I do VNI ratting occasionally, but I prefer abyssal sites because they yield a bit higher isk per hour, I am not contributing to the krabbing epidemic and there’s actual risk.
---
Ya know, I really don't think any alliance has it in them with the current game mechanics as they are. We all have our nice tree forts, with nice high walls. Citadels , FozzieSov and TiDi make taking a region a nearly impossible task when it's against a hardened opponent. It took what, 3 months for goonswarm to take...fade? Also say you manage to take it, then you do what with it exactly? It's not like the rest of the north is going to sit around while you set up shop. 
---
On top of all that, why bother? Considering an alliance of 40k endlessly farms a single region of the game. Why would anyone need more space, it's just more alliance overhead.
---
Exact same comment, wouldn't let me fix formatting on the phone app.
---
Yea im thinking they might have thought sarcasm. I did not.
---
I updoted :(
---
Yeah, no. Not even then will you break 500M an hour consistently.  You might get one 500M hour, but you won't average anywhere near that.
---
You're better than this lmao
---
Can confirm, already dead.
---
The fact that there being conflicting interests is also inherent to representative democracies. It's why we have parties. You can't represent democrat leaning people as a republican congressman just because a few democrats also voted for you.
---
Also "everyone can represent everyone" is an ideologically loaded claim and not the uncontroversial truth you make it to be. There are arguments that you need to be from a certain background to be able to fully understand and represent their problems. That's why people care about having women, blacks, Muslims, native Americans etc in the US Congress. Well.. at least democrats do.. I won't argue with you on the ultimate truth of this approach but I believe in it and I believe it translates to Eve as well.
---
First you retards complain about test blueballing, then try to shame them for taking a fight.
---
lol @ this subreddit
---
Lol [sAmE cOmMeNt](https://i.imgur.com/4c9KRmz.jpg)
---
the real question is,, what kind of chair
---
True.  The benefit of low sec is it's much harder to tackle mass capitals. Our valiant stabbers gave it their all, but saddly all the stabbers in the world are not match for a few bubble bois at holding a group of capitals.
---
That's the "benefits"
---
But why can’t we be violent krabs, fighting for every star system worth of content. Like eve is a zero sum game. The net “worth” of the game isn’t increasing. There are only so many star systems and so many players. We will run out of room eventually and there will be several gigantic wars. But why can’t we violently skirmish for star systems? I mean null sec shouldn’t be safe, but the only really threats there are player generated,  but if players decide they don’t want to fight, then thee is no fighting and the game stagnates and becomes boring. Like everyone has at least one ship that they know will hurt to lose but they know they will have fun losing it in some random back corner of new eden in a 1000 man fight.
---
"It's ok, the pos was saved!"
---
We have them. The worked well in the last war. They're effective for entosis and a squad fucking with enemy logi in fleet fights. Instawarp out.
---
Oh hell no. We came up here for this. It was an awesome fight and we want more. TEST is one of the few entities in the game where you should and can drop everything on them. Do it.

That, or you're just inflating your numbers to look cool on the internet like people tend to do.
---
Have you ever spent hours sitting in an entosis ship endlessly cycling your entosis mod on one node after another just so you can come back and do it again later in the week?

Oh lordy

horde definitely has a supercap fleet, it just doesn't seem to get used often
---
The pure angur in this post...its top tier.
---
You don't get the luxury of only representing the people who vote for you, or the people of your party. You're the sole representative for every person in your district. Since the CSM is elected at large, we all represent all of the players. 
---
Instead of arguing with me about this, wouldn't it be more beneficial to try to hold others to the same standard I hold for myself, which is to put the best interests of the game ahead of my personal interests or the interests of my alliance or playstyle? Instead of contradicting me when I try my best to represent everybody, why not hold folks who don't do that to a higher standard?
---
If you can't train shittalk to 5 you're not nulling

Real talk: very slick moves there. Dropping the subs in to get the carriers nice and aggro'd up. Then the dreads drop in, baiting our own dreads hungry for a fight. Then the soups jump at range and DD everything. Notbad.png

You need to provide evidence of that for anything to happen. You have some evidence right?
---
Mate... I was there. We welped plenty of caps...
---
TBH they didn't have to put much effort into reporting mar5hy since he provided the proof himself in multiple locals.
---
You missed my point - are you arguing that women can't represent men?  Or a gay Congressman couldn't represent straight people? Obviously that's not true. It's not true here any more than it's true anywhere else. And the guy who was Governor of Massachusetts just got elected Senator in Utah, so I'd question whether your view there is really accurate.
---
The FAX nerf hurts everybody, especially folks that have a large supercap fleet that relies on FAXes to save their Titans. It also impacted Rorquals, which made the unkillable triple CASB fit a thing of the past, helping making Rorqs easier to kill.  Given that my coalition has more Rorqs than the rest of the game combined, making them easier to kill is clearly against my self interest, but I advocated for that anyway. 
---
Whether getting rid of local is a good idea or a bad idea, it would make nullsec a hell of a lot less safe than it is now, and that's arguing against my own interests. 
---
No asset safety gives nullsec fights more meaning, and creates a bigger incentive for invading areas that otherwise would be left alone. The folks with more stuff have more stuff to lose, and thus they're risking more. 
---
I don't build capital ships, so seeing more of them die does not benefit me personally. And considering I've lost a titan this year, I clearly am not risk averse. 
---
Here's the reality - almost every change in the game hurts and helps, and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to spin these changes to claim that nothing I've done negatively impacts my group, when the reality is that I don't let my personal preferences or benefits or the benefit to my alliance change my opinions about what I think is best for the game. The fact that I've spent most of my time advocating for stuff that doesn't impact me at all makes that pretty clear. 
---
 
---
I don't expect to change your mind, but I know what I've been doing and why, and I know you're being overly cynical for no reason. 
---
Well after you complete the tutorial you're told to go talk to the Agent mission dudes, so as a new player that knows nothing about EVE this to me, implies this is what you're supposed to be doing. So I did that and it was terrible. To say the game is great IF you get into the right corp or IF you can find the right situation or IF you can get into a good fleet. Too many if's for a new player when you can look on Twitch and see a billion other games that have more action faster without having to literally have a 2nd job just to play a video game. 
---
I get it EVE is hardcore or whatever but everyone is missing the point of my post. Do you think its healthy for the game having this pay to wait timer on all toons just to be able to PLAY not even enjoy but just to PLAY the content they created? And what content is there really? Mining, ratting and pvp. That's it. Unless EVE is your first video game and you never done any questing before in a game then MAYBE agent missions but for how long? I lasted less than a month of that bullshit, my time is more valuable to me than to waste it on a space MMO centered around waiting for skills to complete so you can go out and do shit. You're looking at over 100 bucks just to SEE what the game has to offer. That's shit design. 
---
When have I ever done that? 
---
BoMbErS bAr Is NeUtRaL
---
Oh, and the POS lived. With almost 70 titans shooting it... Lol.
---
No.. It’s not..
---
Highly recommended you don't join a corp while doing incursions. That's why most do high sec incursions on alts. 
---
Create yourself a corp with no tax rate (NPC corps have 10% tax or whatever it is) and then if you ever get war dec'd which is unlikely in a 1 man corp then just close the corp and make a new one. 
---
If a corp was ever to be shown to running high sec incursions as a group often they would be permanently war dec'd because everybody knows most incursion ships are blingy.
---
This is the best reply. Thank you!
---
I kind of get the feeling that you don't understand what a hypothetical situation is, as both times I have tried to use one to define something to simplify something complex, you reply like it's a face-value situation. So I'll try to simplify it further, with no hypothetical:   
---
The job of the CEO is to make money for the investors, so, if it's a competition between making investors money, and making a small segment of customers more happy, he is duty bound to make the investors more money. The job of the developer is to take direction from, eventually, the CEO.    
---
The OP suggests that "CCP" (vague, but based on context I assume this to mean Hillmar or a random developer) should grow some balls and make changes that make the game less accessible for causal players, and more entertaining for more hard-core players.    
---
By suggesting this, OP is essentially saying that someone at CCP should go against the grain, the grain being the financial benefit to the investors by making the game more accessible to casual players.    
---
By saying that, OP is making a harmful selfish request, which I did my best to define to OP.   
---
Hope that clears it up for you.
---
Does CBB still spout all that religious nonsense in local?
---
the ore i have seen advertised today in our trade channel alone could easily rebuild all the caps lost (along with regular caps on field for both sides).
---
Logistics of doing so, bit annoying but really all it takes is 1 pilot shifting production from a titan to dreads.

Implying Provi have the strength to punch something...

BLFOX's friendship with DHSJ got us soooo many good fights! I was in Villore Accords for the longest time (I'm in TNT now).

---
I was on it? huh. Missed that.
---
With the way the system worked, I most certainly did get votes from elsewhere.

Because there was next to no vote transfer from their third candidate, iirc. (I've not looked at the results recently. But for people voting strict ballot, positions 5-10 were pretty much useless, as vote exhaustion happened before then)
---
mm, your name is familiar.  we got into an ss duel, https://zkillboard.com/kill/74457009/ and https://zkillboard.com/kill/74457089/  , as your gram died a little to quick i had to kill my own gram (1 left of 12).

Damn I was off by 10 days huh
---
Started "playing" in 2010 for about a month, played in 2015/2016 for about 1 month each. Finally came back to the game in December 2017 with 10 million SP on one account and 3 million on the other.  
---
Been playing a little over 1 year and 10 days since then. In the time I've gone from 2 accounts to 8. In the next 2 months or so all of their skill training's will finish and I will have the following:  
---
1) Sub-Cap PvP toon  
---
2) Super  
---
3) FAX  
---
4) Dread  
---
5) Rorqual  
---
6) Manufacturing Toon   
---
7) Reaction Toon  
---
8) Sabre Alt  
---
I got here by starting 50 alpha toons the day I came back and sold 28 of them for \~4.5 bil each 6 months later. I kept 22 of them to make my 6 other accounts (I already had 2) and in addition to this I put 2 Skill Farms on each of the 8 accounts in order to pay for the sub on that account.   
---
I made about 40 billion ISK from the 28 accounts that I sold (had to buy 1000 PLEX in order to do the transfer) I used that capital to transfer toons to my other accounts... unfortunately those transfer cost more than the profit soooo that was awk and not every accounts was able to get a skill farm on it right away.  
---
Since I didn't have to grind isk to plex my accounts (thanks to the skill farms) it was pretty much 100% profit after getting them all set up (took about 2 more months). I was living in Drone Lands at the time and ran a bunch of 10/10s, which was super good money (at the time). Eventually I joined an alliance that has an actual super umbrella and started rorq mining with the other 7 accounts sitting in Covetors, I am able to attend almost every moon mining op, which is crazy good isk.   
---
I'm loving EVE. I love spreadsheets, I love blowing shit up, and I love my alliance and corp mates.   
---
I'll admit here that I've dropped some money by buying 4 galaxy packs when they were on sale vOv but that's the only IRL isk I've spent this year on the game.   
---
I've grinded... a lot.... but I've not done too much ratting. Mainly just hang out in the belts for a few hours a week shooting the shit with people. I go on quite a few nano-cruiser roams with my corp and attend most alliance/coalition fleets.   
---
I guess to answer your question... I've spent the last year getting my accounts all set up haha. But at least I wasn't VNI ratting ;) 
---
Hahahaha oh my, citadel tether is the replacement for pos shield. You guys seriously think they are gonna add an exact replacement for the pos?
---
Unless they had a way to make it so you can 100% prevented from escaping, No, tether is not a replacement for it.
---
That's really awesome!!! I was introduced to Eve by a guy in my Platoon at my first duty station, IGN Vaanic Dale. Taught me how to fight by getting me into ratting (taught me the basics of targeting, orbitting, module activation, etc.), then got me into a real pvp fight when our HS alliance got wardecced and we successfully set up a counter trap cause we figured out the wardeccers had a spy in our corp, and we figured out who it was. then onto Nullsec. He was my Eve mentor, and we're still friends to this day, but he stopped playing. Id like to think that if he saw my character now, and what Ie been up to, he'd be proud.   
---
TL/DR, IRL friends that play Eve with you are the best kind.
---
This was fucking hilarious hahah. Nice job
---
Let me be the first to say, upvoted.
---
I....Can't believe I missed this.  Oh well, at least it wasn't a total loss and I got to have my first car accident instead!
---
lmao'd real hard
---
 A+ post
---
Wh/hic changes
---
Many wh people told you that porp wasn't an option, you pushed porpoise anyway while advertising yourself as a wh representative. 
---
the fact that there are enough sound clips to do this is fucking amazing
---
&gt;The question should rather be "why should they be an issue ?"
---
Then you argue against a fictional position. So the correct question is "why are they not an issue?".
---
&gt;why the fuck shouldn't you if you want to do it ?
---
Becuase that ideology breaks the game.
---
&gt;Injectors are not that evil monster everyone wants to portrait, I inject chars myself (with ISKs) and I really don't care, cause I have objectives and it is good for CCP if they sell extractors. 
---
Because you don't understand the importance of balance. Players who abuse mechanics are often unable to see that something that benefits them actually hurts the game.
---
CSM 12 summit II:
---
&gt;Quant mentions that the game design and economy changes after skill trading and plex is very complicated due to the monetary exchange involved. **Such as players buying supercapitals and the skills and then it being nerfed for the sake of a healthier game**.
---
My corp and I are always looking for new, friendly people that like to pvp and also do plenty of carebear stuff out in nullsec. If youre looking for a corp full of friendly people, you should look at Systems High Guard. (I know, I know, blast me for shamless recruitment promotion lol) I joined them about a month and a half ago, and I already call it home, and havent looked back. My reddit is my IGN if you wanna hit me up.:) We'd be glad to have you!
---
I'm not a hypocrite, ban all botters and input broadcasters.
---
There's a reason they put in the have i been pwnd check for passwords.
---
You should share! Ill trade stories with you, that way you can include multiple stories with multiple friends, and people can read and appreciate the experiences! :)
---
Except it's not. If you're say...super carrier ratting, and you warp into a pos shield with your fighters out, you are safe. If you warp to a citadel, you are not. Also you can't be bumped out. 
---
&gt;Titan is the same as just buying a Titan pilot on the bazaar, which has always been an option.
---
The supply of toons with specific skills was always somewhat limited. To have those specific skills, you actually had to train them. Now 100 toons can just train "bullshit skill 1" 10000 times and instantly translate that into whatever.
---
The fungibility of SP is retarded.
---
Im sorry for your loss, brother. Losing those kinds of friends hurts in a way that never goes away. But those memories you have, and sharing them here, honor him. Go make some stuff explode in his memory! Ill be sure to toast him with a drink when I do our corp roam this saturday. :)
---
It's not the _only_ way, exactly
---
And for multiboxers, 2FA is already a thing. It's really infrequent, due to how the login system actually works.
---

SS duels! Fighters are such cancer (cause of lag). Real talk though, Can we talk about the pandemic horde guy on my fighter loss mail? [https://zkillboard.com/kill/74457009/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/74457009/)
---
is there a list of corporations, that do this sorta stuff, talking about hitting/harrassing sov alliances while basing out of lowsec/npc 0.0
---
I was used to do this sorta combat/playstyle for quite a while, but then my alliance got sov and we lost this way of life.
---
Any recommendations (corps/alliances)?
---
How much is this fantastic product!?!
---
&gt;I am in that case, I have enough ISK to inject a new char into a Titan, I just don't want to, I'm more of a Dreadnough type of guy and it's what I'll do.
---
So essentially you are just defending your own position. You think this is about you. It is not.
---
Star Wars the Old Republic has an item vendor with some exclusive items that you only have access to if you enabled 2FA on your account.
---
Perhaps CCP could do something similar? an SP incentive I imagine would not be as effective because some people will disable 2FA because they will get sick of having to open their phone every time they want to log in to zkillboard via eve
---
for goons to put up a good fight but then lose to their betters
---
oops
---
I wish I could upvote this more
---
The fact that you think representatives "have to" vote based upon their party affiliation is the cancer thats killing representative democracy, it isnt supppsed to be a feature.
---
My style here is that I usually argue what I believe to be true regardless of instrumental value. But in this case there is value in debunking the kind of myth you are spreading, so maybe next time those who are not too immersed in mega null empire playstyle can elect their own respresentative who truly thinks alike, rather than thinking Brisc can represent them. 
---
Politicians have a duty to lead change as much as represent. Framing and pushing for change and convincing people to their cause on the way is as ineliminable from the politician as ability to listen. Your kind of passive listener shell politician approach to politics is actually a shortcoming of US politics. For all that, we need to know politicians' stance and worldview and decide if that aligns with ours. Particularly on conflicted manners. For Eve, your worldview does not align with many you claim to be representing.
---
I did however recognize and appreciate your approachability hoping that it poses an example to others. I prefer you way times over completely absent CSMs.
---
No, fuck off. CCP don't ban obvious botters anyway.
---
Roleplaying is fun, I wish there was more of it. As it is, I roleplay my character in my head most of the time. Ive thought about creating an Amarr roleplay alt, cause I fucking love Amarrian ships and lasers in general. Know of any good Amarr RP groups? :)
---
More complicated, unless you're using the yubikey authenticator app with it. (in which case it's exactly the same, just with the secret stored on the yubikey)
---
Remember to make tons of scanning alphas
---
you probably can't. And can't have a password longer than 12 characters.
---
Because banks are fucking useless with security.
---
One thing I want to point out: With games like this, people rarely talk about things that work. Then when there's a legitimate problem, you'll get an echo chamber of everyone piling on.
---
That's not to say there aren't legit problems, but I haven't stopped playing, and I doubt most of them have either.
---
He is a cheater, i agree with that. But delve has more cheaters then his 200 accounts. In that way, you should all be banned for this. Isnt it?   
---
Amazing how protected they are. Internal affairs are ignoring everything.
---
I wonder how much other assistance goons get regularly.
---
I understand where you are coming from but the point you are talking about isn't the one I wanted to make. My point is that a representative cant vote in everyone's interest due to the very fact that there are conflicting interests. That's one of the reasons why we have parties and it's a good reason. They don't however have to vote fully aligned with party stances all times.
---
Who's shaming?
---
https://twitter.com/stebets/status/1069912553059422209 is pretty good.
---
It's actually a lot of fun. Some people have fun building empires. Others have fun social-engineering their way to tens of billions of isk heists.  
---
That's the beauty of a sandbox.  
---
The specific day is more of a random example to illustrate the idea but yeah you summarized it quite nicely. There are a number of ways to deal with the issue but in the interest of not becoming 'modzi' and overmoderating that limits the options greatly. I could just log in and when it looks to me like there are too many botting threads.. well, the remove button is right there. But we ought to remove sparingly otherwise it becomes a subreddit of topics I (or any mod) wants to see and not one that everyone can at least sort of live with.
---
There's not a lot of "ifs" I moved to null sec within 2 weeks of playing when I 1st started and have never looked back. 
---
I realized after my 1st retriever lost nullsec is where it's at. But they didn't have tutorials and all the other shit behind it.
---
If you want content and fun and you're willing to give the game another shot at some point and wanna come to null sec. Let me know. If not, it makes sense.
---
Suiciders are cancer. Thats all.

10/10 /u/concernedeve quality shitposting. Actually you have a little effort thrown into your posts while /u/concernedeve just spits crap out of his mouth!

It's not r/eve. It's really any game's sub except those with Overwhelmingly Positive rating on Steam. I really like and enjoy Eve, Overwatch, Artifact. All those 3 games' subreddits are shitfests.

Lets see. Exploration, especially in Stain. I also dabbled in hunting explorers, but never managed to get one. 
---
I also took a Hecate to querious to look for VNIs to hunt, found an AFK rorqual, and killed about 5.5 bil in excavators and mackinaws. Then I proceeded to feed a few dozen Hecates trying to copy that, and only managed to get one excavator more.

Have you considered taking the throbbing cock out of your throat for 15 seconds and leaving the subreddit? You won't be missed friend.

This is standard war posting mate. Its only gonna get worse as the million dollar fights^TM wind up. Welxome to /r/eve

so far we we've done missions, rat clearing/salvage  and mining that's about it. we're pretty much up to try anything.
---
6 months ago GSF and the rest of the Imperium were in the middle of shitting on the North, powered by the ISK created by their krabs. The rest of the game finally took note, and has been trying to catch up, most notably, according to the latest MER, TEST. Others, due to lessened pressure after "The Deal" are also trying to ramp up their krabbing. There are those that are resisting the urge to krab. You can see their posts around this subreddit crying about all sorts of topics, but it boils down to them being broke and not being able to afford to fight.
---
Whoa, 10/10 burn dude, you really got me

How can i be as cool as you? Do i have to smoke the marijuana cigarettes too?

Shut up Sue you irrelevant fuck

Noice.

TEST's always feeding shit to something, but it appears they're getting better at it. /u/sueabbott

I've been playing for 11 years and people have said it's dying every day of those 11. 
---
r/eve sucks because it's the only main community outside of the forums and ingame, but i'm convinced 95% of the people here don't even play anymore.

Horde has fought TEST 1v1 in Highsec about 50 times so far, they've won 3.

Probably a good post to plug them in 
---
&gt;are you arguing that women can't represent men? Or a gay Congressman couldn't represent straight people? Obviously that's not true.
---
No, I'm arguing that a congressman not part of that group will make a worse representative for that group the one that is part of that group, with the provision that when somebody claims to do so it should ring alarm bells (because it's very rare an especially in politics for people to not do so for there own benefit rather than altruism), and more importantly when a system systematically selects people of a particular group it's unlikely to benefit anybody but members of that group. 
---
Now I guess for the benefit of anybody else reading this: 
---
&gt;The FAX nerf hurts everybody, especially folks that have a large supercap fleet that relies on FAXes to save their Titans.
---
Not how Titan warfare works and you are aware of this, the moment both sides commit a large group of titans fax count doesn't matter. 
---
&gt; It also impacted Rorquals, which made the unkillable triple CASB fit a thing of the past, helping making Rorqs easier to kill.
---
Sorta like the Triple CASB fit mostly exists because some Rorq pilots where aware tackle means tank until DT because rescue wasn't likely now my suspicion is that was likely, not high on the imperium's problems list. 
---
Now if that is a good or a bad thing is a secondary question but let's not pretend it was some massive nerf to the way the Imperium runs the rorqs. 
---
&gt;Whether getting rid of local is a good idea or a bad idea, it would make nullsec a hell of a lot less safe than it is now, and that's arguing against my own interests.
---
Yes and I believe CCP should delete all capitals it's as easy a position to take because we're both very much aware it won't happen, now deletion of local is to abstract for either me or you to predict clear benefits, as it changes too many aspects of the game, I suspect the test intel bots might become more popular. ( yes I'm aware there a real player copying d-scan ). 
---
&gt;No asset safety gives nullsec fights more meaning, and creates a bigger incentive for invading areas that otherwise would be left alone. The folks with more stuff have more stuff to lose, and thus they're risking more.
---
The problem is let's be real no imperium entity has to fear a relocation in the near future because there is nobody with both the will and resources to do it. 
---
So really you don't have to fear such a relocation, while anybody else well how exactly can stop a test/imperium deployment? 
---
&gt; I don't build capital ships, so seeing more of them die does not benefit me personally. And considering I've lost a titan this year, I clearly am not risk averse.
---
Really you can't work this out, your coalition mines 90% of the ore in eve meaning you outproduce anybody else in terms of capital production or in other words if all the caps exploded tomorrow it would be to your benefit because you have the shorter route to replacement. 
---
&gt; almost every change in the game hurts and helps, and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to spin these changes to claim that nothing I've done negatively impacts my group.
---
When 75% of my government is rich, I'm gonna suspect they do this to benefit the rich when 75% of the CSM is Goons, I'm gonna suspect they do this to benefit goons. 
---
Call it cynical but when the majority of people talking to the devs fly that banner any sane person would suspect they might be advocating more for there fellow banner carriers than for the rest of eve.
---
Especially given most of the discussion happens in a closed room where we never hear the out from because of NDA.
---
The bitch of it is, that even if you're doing the best job humanly possible, yes there is no real way to convince me because when more than 75% of you carry the same banner that banner will always be suspect and no that isn't fair but it's the cost of being a massive collective. 
---
Now luckily for you at the end of the day what I think doesn't matter because all you need is the imperium vote to get re-elected. 
---
“ha ha made you...uh...make our trip home easier? by relieving us of our volumous capital ships! yes, let’s go with that”
---
- dinobrains, probably
---
Sorta, like the GSF like formed a rather large voting block, given how much of there ballot reflected the result, not sure if you were on any other null block ballots, but consider that the likely source of the numerical votes.
---
Incorrect, we've been beating on each other for weeks with fleets. Geminate beans are battle hardened, and mentally geared for war. It's just how we operate on the daily. Just another day in Gem.
---
Mine gets almost 13mil a day in high sec (0,5), 1 character and with the scanning skills at 3. Mostly making t1 reactive, base and toxic metals plus robotics among a few t2. 
---
I thought the yield was much much much higher in nullsec because everyone always sais so. Is there less tax or so on the customs office?
---
Glad you're back! I love this game too and find it, or at least my corp, to be a mostly very positive place.  Although this subreddit is a large voice for the player base and does often seem negative, I imagine the voices of most players are never heard here.  There also seems to be a lot of fun on here too, so there's that.  
---
I too hope the devs are able to process all the sperging here in a healthy way.  They are good people working really hard to make this gigantic game work.  They have connected me in a meaningful way with nerds all over the world, and to think I used to be a normie. 
---
I just come here for the funny/ epic stories and videos.  Other than that I like to spend my eve time playing the game. See you out there o7
---
If you find it that would be amazing! I was just tackle during the fight I would love to hear the comms and see the fight from the main guys. I’m still new but this fight was the best yet that shit was incredible!
---
It's not rare at all for elected officials to do what's in the best interests of their constituents over their personal interests. If they were putting their personal interests first, they wouldn't have run in the first place. It's a shitty job. 
---
You chew through the FAXes first, giving the Titans a chance to get off the field. The quicker you chew through the FAXes, the sooner you get to the Titans. That's how the nerf hurt. Come on, man. 
---
Reducing the tank on a Rorq hurts the folks who use Rorqs more than anybody else. That's common sense. 
---
"The problem is let's be real no imperium entity has to fear a relocation in the near future because there is nobody with both the will and resources to do it." - that sounds awfully like "Nobody will ever kill the HK Keepstar because nobody has the will or the resources to do it."
---
It's unfortunate that nothing I say can change your mind. 
---
Formalizing feedback like that isn't a bad idea honestly. I'm extremely open to feedback (for you naysayers if you happen to read this: check my post history) but that doesn't mean a huge portion of the posters here even have any idea who I am much less so that it's an option. I think the problems would be getting the rate of feedback threads right.
---
I can't seem to find it. Was a third party steam with no comms or audio, just a camera man showing the battle with a bunch of us commenting in chat
---
I'm not spreading any myths, Olmeca. I'm explaining to you how representative democracy works, because you apparently were sick the day the taught civics in middle school.
---
There is no duty to "lead change," unless the people want the change. If they don't, trying to force it is not representing them. There are ways you can nudge folks in the right direction, but if you get out too far ahead of somebody, you're going to end up getting pulled back. 
---
My worldview does not need to align with the folks I represent. I'm going to have opinions that differ, and beliefs that differ. So long as I am not substituting my own personal preferences for what the majority wants, then I'm doing my job. 
---
I floated that porpoise idea because a WHer gave it to me. Turns out his solution wasn't a popular one. I never pushed the porpoise. I asked the community if that was a solution. They said no. So I pushed for a module or a script because that's what folks said they wanted, and that's what we ended up getting. 
---
Did you just not anticipate a supercapital escalation?  I also noticed only 3 faxes on the BR.  How many were there total?
---
that's only a tiny tiny fraction of what we have of our beloved PGL.
---
Now my Alexa can be as disappointed in me as I am of it 
---
The dota version I remember:

---
the reddit/eve overlap has become more pronounced in the last few years which has contributed to the content getting shittier/whinier
---
few years ago this subreddit was mostly test players, some self-hating goons and randoms from those communities within eve.
---
3-5 years later and we have mainstream entitled gamers who take eve too seriously and pine away for the day that they can fly with their body pillow off to korea to join the pro-gaming circuit.  They tend to suck the fun out of online discussion
---
The world needs more people that just come out and say this.. 
---
first time for everything.  Hopefully not the last, I look forward to (and expect) more gudfites
---
&gt;You chew through the FAXes first, giving the Titans a chance to get off the field. The quicker you chew through the FAXes, the sooner you get to the Titans. That's how the nerf hurt. Come on, man.
---
You don't DD faxes, you DD titans, titan balls are setup as an alpha doctrine alpha doctrines don't engage logi, Come on man. 
---
&gt; Reducing the tank on a Rorq hurts the folks who use Rorqs more than anybody else. That's common sense.
---
Reducing a specific tank setup that wasn't used be everyone only hurts those with that setup. 
---
&gt; that sounds awfully like "Nobody will ever kill the HK Keepstar because nobody has the will or the resources to do it."
---
The difference is with the HK keepstar an entity techinically existed but nobody figured they where willing (or more that the folks how did would be willing to spent that time seeding), with the imperium the numbers are literally not in the game as long as test helps you. 
---
of the 10 biggest alliances in the game 6 are in either the legacy or the imperium, this isn't like the bob day's where a big influx of players will change the ballance.
---
It's really common for standings to bug out on fighters in tidi so they show as not being in a corp (neutral). Most of the older players know to ignore that but all bets are off for horde. 
---
Pretty pissed off this isn't a real thing tbh.
---
Credits to Ti Onren in dreddit amazing job.
---
b-b-b-but gudfites!?   cmon tell me you're not stiff right now
---
So...like when local messes up and you scam disappears into the abyss?
---
Not to mention the secondary effects of Rorq's - boatloads of ore entering into Null-sec economies. 
---
Rorq skills translate well into carrier/FAX pilots, suddenly it make sense to have 3 capital-trained alts. 
---
Capital-ships are easier to build, and there's more players that want them. Smart alliances that embraced the rorq (and the necessary rorq-save fleets) found it was the fast route to a capital-fleet. 
---
We’re NC’s nephew, not cousin
---
It’s an overview glitch. Horde doesn’t even have caps. They were all PL or NC.
---
I’m assuming your flair is unironic...
---
Which is really fucking hilarious.
---
One Horde guy streams Oija for gatecamps
---
''betters''
---
One is not better with a green killboard while they hide their shame krabing in renting corps.
---
tbh so would Goons.
---
It will be just some "solo dudes" and "sigs" though as per narrative.
---
I mean a tick is 20 minutes?  So if you are averaging 167 million ticks super ratting, yeah, 500 million an hour is reasonable, right?
---
It also says at the bottom of the pop up when you will too it. But by then it's too late 😀
---
Someone streaming an actual perspective with comms would be a real quick kick from corp
---
People gotta mine for the ships you want to blow up.  
---
Go try to kill the miners, fight the people defending them, and stop complaining.
---
You don’t want the capital escalation, go pick on a small lowsec or WH corp.
---
Plus, half of the roqrks are probably people’s alts to fund their PVP fun.
---
I know my alt is going to be mining a lot of ice, to power the WH stations, to get the mats we need to build the stuff to fight in...
---
How the heck do people not understand the whole process behind what makes the stuff you need to go pew pew?
---
Grathlexa was better my friend

It can be worth looking at exactly how the votes transferred around.
---
The way the system works, all the votes go to the first candidate, and if they're elected, some slides down to the next candidate on each ballot. 
---
So you can see how much transfers at each stage. 
---
https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/resources/auditLog.txt is the audit log from the election.
---
You can see, in the first pass, I got something like 11 votes transferring from goon candidates. (before transfers, I had the fifth highest number of first place positions)
---
By the last pass, I had enough votes to get elected without transfer. The last pass is where there's only 11 candidates remaining, and everyone has been shuffled up the ballots as eveyone else is eliminated. 
---
I remember when it was the Eve Official Forums that everyone thought was the super-important opinion database that CCP should revolve around. BoB and Goons going at it, talking shit without nearly as much fear. The game has changed a lot. I wonder how many people post there now as opposed to here? 
---
Reddits whole design encourages circle-jerking. A lot of circle jerking and awful low-effort  gimmick posting. Its fucking nauseating.
---
gating home from the north in my titan was an exercise in futility
---
after getting bumped 140km from the gate twice i wish i had been primary'd in x47
---
like where the fuck do these other titans even come from when you're coming in from an off angle
---
Can anyone tell me what the point of a target painter on the Monitor is? To let an enemy know he's about to be primaried?
---
PGL Alexa skill when?
---
&gt;tapi wins subcap fights outnumbered
---
You're probably spending too much time here as well.
---
tapi even mentioning being outnumbered with a hint of salt in tyool 2019
---
my sides
---
when citadels were announced, bump immunity in tether was listed as a core feature and they haven't found a way to implement it yet
---
Looks like you were in a bad corp i am afraid. 
---
There is no reason an alpha cannot do fleets on day one. Sure as disposable tackle. I think they did you a great deservice here by forcing you to train without you getting invested in eve on your own. 
---
I also find it disturbing that they did not teach a new player self reliance so one does not have to buy with cash injectors / ships  and the like....
---
Are you in a hisec corp?!
---
Its not the gameplay per say the F1 etc... its more the planning the reason behind the actions. Then again you are far to young to understand the complexities of a fight.
---
 Fleet combat is different from solo pvp and there you will feel the adrenaline rush as its just you and your cash, the mechanics get waay more involved and the battle is won or lost before the fight, you just don't know it yet.
---
But then again your points remain valid.
---
wtb avatar sized truck nuts
---
This is why EVE has to last forever: it brings out the best of unabashed bullshit and creativity in us.
---
I laughed hard at this one :-).
---
Already you're easier to talk to than CCP because you actually respond to things with something other than "because I said so". Getting the timing right is key, yeah, and ensuring that posts of just "x sucks" are encouraged to elaborate. 
---
It could be that they did a temp ban for a full 5 minutes before the last downtime and you just missed it. It is ccp and this allows them to keep raking in the rmt related cash while 'enforcing' policy. 
---
Daily reminder he did nothing in violation of the Eula and GM interpretation. 
---

---
Let’s the FC get on killmails
---
Weeeewooooweeeewoooooweeeewoooooooo
---
not sure where you're getting that that fight made us overconfident, bud
---
basically everyone already knew at that point that supercaps within range of a sufficient fax cache are virtually unkillable by a dread bomb of any size, yall just decided to use empirical methods to test it
---
what it did teach us was that our fax caches outgirthed your dread cache, meaning we could just drop supers on you with complete impunity for the rest of that deployment, which we did
---
if you'd care to elaborate on where you think we were overconfident, then by all means
---
"she"
---
I disagree, in large fleets he would feel useful provided he is given free ships and SRP. 
---
Sometimes that extra second of tackle or that extra ping on grid provided by a newbee is just what the FC needs.
---
And yes doctrine ships are not always for omegas and most large alliances should or have a variant for new guys.
---
Why does PGL's voice remind me of leafyishere sometimes?

There is a lot that happened behind the scenes, but in the end we remember the memes.
---
I mean the product seems great but I have to ask, does it come in blue so it fits in with the rest of my TAPI overview?
---
Suicide ganking in nullsec.  Thinking.
---
If you are "suicide ganking" in nullsec you are just really bad at PvP.
---
We'd done the same thing for a month and nothing happened.  We even have done riskier things recently and not been dropped.  We got the hubris.
---
Derth are you gone for good at this stage?
---
Sure i will take the bait.
---
\~\~Alts\~\~
---
Good on you, better to have taken the fight and had fun, then to stand down. Props for jumping!
---
the krabs have always been here, you just noticing them? 
---
Hyper krab here, the highest tick I can get consistantly in a super is at 120m. Gonna have to disprove the guy above you. Sure, I can hit 140m ticks but that's one in a blue moon.
---
DD IN low sec?wtf dude?did they change dd mechanics?
---
For 4 minutes, sure. I have 2FA everywhere else so I'm not against the idea itself.
---
This is great. updoot to u.
---
Have you ever played Escape from Tarkov? What about Hardcore Path of Exile? EVE isn't as punishing and the attitude you bring into this discussion, this assumption that I'm looking for instant gratification is absurd having read my post above. 
---
I'm providing feedback based on my experience. I'm too am sorry I wasn't able to see the full beauty of EVE but I think I've explained many reasons as to why I was unable to. Now if you want to help and maybe provide some things to actually do that is not only fun but engaging, I may give it a try this weekend. However your attitude, If I was anyone else, would completely push away any remaining desire to continue playing EVE. Was that your intention or did you just come here to tell me how hardcore the game used to be for folks? If so, I've played more hardcore games and excel at them. Waiting around for skills to complete so I can maybe go out and PVP is ridiculous to expect from a new player WANTING to see what EVE has to offer. To just sit inside a station waiting around for "Logistic Missile Range Level 2" or mining or even ratting is a sure fire way to not have any new players join the EVE community. 
---
I'm asking vets what I should be doing and being told to scan for relics and hack sites. Do they not understand how boring that is to someone who has over 25 years of gaming experience? Im sure you old vets enjoyed that back in 2009 or whatever but gaming has evolved and it would appear EVE has not. 
---
Also, Continuum of war 1 and 2 on YouTube.
---
You can just wait till you get like 8-10 bookmarks then burn around in a ceptor and sell them all for like 1b which is a big spike in profit for half an hour of warping around 
---
I always thought Eve would be a great setting for Traveller. You would only need to pay a century's worth of sub time to pay for all the rulebooks and supplements and shit.
---
I've read words. Good words. Am amazed 
---
Dude, seriously, i hope you renewed that!
---
What marauder did you fly?
---
Lots and lots of frigate and a small amount of cruiser PVP vs roamers and farmers in Horde space.
---
It is a lot of fun having so much content right on your doorstep :)

Are you talking to yourself about yourself?

It's not only ticks, dude probably is counting escalations and faction/capital spawns. Not constant but it usually happens.

---
'Horde alone can deal with Test'
---
'Horde has next door, the rest of PANFAM'
---
contradicting yourself in two consecutive sentences.
---
Sure you talk about defense and attack ... but you really know if the second sentence wasnt true, you woyldnt have written the first either. 
---
Shadows, don't forget about shadows, also run from those. 
---
Be nimble, get good running shoes and remember to stretch.
---
"Getting out there" is a hard thing to define. It really depends on what you like doing most! If you are more into mining ratting, then you should maybe look into further variations and what others have done before. Try to learn the mechanics of that, for example by watching videos or looking up certain things on Wikis.  
---
For PvP while there are many videos and documents out there to read, hopping into some Twitch streams can be quite helpful. Try to understand what that person is doing and ask questions if you have any, try it yourself atferwards and if you like it do it again. There are so many different things in EVE so it is hard to cover everything, but try to find what you like.  
---
And you should not think that you as a new player cannot participate in certain things, even Frigates are helpful in PvP, Exploration and other PvE Content.

---
Having the visual que on where someone will be ahead of time is a major fucking advantage - imagine you're trying to catch a capital that you followed in warp, or an interceptor trying to catch a subcap trying to escape. "They warped to next gate" - "Already here boss, I see where they will land aprox 50km from gate - I'll sit and wait till I can tackle".
---
Not being bumpable means nothing, this is catastrophic.
---
It's really time they started being more organised. It's been a shitshow for years now.
---
yeah fuck those australians not setting their timers to USTZ 
---
I was looking for the correct one, was a pretty good form
---
Next time, a little better photoshop/ms paint. Overall 10/10 corps would leave again.
---
Are they seriously doable in a single dread?
---
I'm guessing he did 95% of the damage with a super and then waited for the super to get off the Kill mail, because that's way less than the damage taken should be. So no, unless something changed or he figured out some kind of exploit / glitch
---
Daily reminder to ban someone for input broadcasting so that hundreds of rorqual pilots can input broadcast instead. And still wondering why CCP hasn't done a thing.

As a new player, i joined eve because i heard it was a harsh open pvp mmo. THE ONLY FULL OPEN WORLD PVP MMO. So i aprove of this post. If they keep nerfing pvp I will go play something else.
---
please sir, hybrids and lasers

Please don't start the "we're getting blobbed" whining this early in the campaign.  There's a time for that, but it's not yet.

Oh but that's the way it goes

You can anchor a large secure container in a special safe spot to store your loot. They can't be combat scanned and you can set a password. Every time you access the can it restarts a 30 day timer.
---
Okay, but who are Evictus?
---
Honest question btw

this is fantastic

Definitely Myspace.  Make social media great again

Honestly, I'm pretty sure that more than half the people here don't actually play EVE anymore.
---
Aside from that I completely agree. I come here for the AARs, stories, and I try to help answer any newbro questions I can. Hell, I even enjoy the shitposts. However, these days I tend to only stop by once or twice a week because I can't take the constant bitching and complaining about how broken the game is and how CCP employees are all retards.

1 week of inactivity also doesn't mean anything about who lives there. A lot of WH pvp happens outside of home in your chain, although this is not as often the case in C2s since you have a k-space feeding you nerds in explo ships.

Blockade has 21M in bounties. Add mission payout, LPs and loot, and it gets close to 30M.

I really don't want to dive into this, as I quickly get belittled on when revealing my concerns around personal data.

See _BearHawk's reply. But after your detailed explanation, i owe you this.
---
I probably picked the wrong term in the first place as english is not my native language and this seems to be kind of a trigger,
---
making me look like some conspiracy theorist. And perhaps I am one. I just try to deliberately avoid those big internet companies
---
wherever possible to be a part of my life and sometimes this turns out to be ignorant, like in the case of Eve 2FA.
---
Having said that makes me a bit of a hypocrite, as i sometimes feel the urge to express my views here on reddit :-)
---
Nonetheless I deem that approach healthier than just using everything available that makes my life a little easier.
---
As for big data itself, my admittedly vague and again uninformed view is that we already leave so many paper-trails
---
in our on- and offline lives, illiberal governments are on the rise and some internet companies became so big they
---
can be seen as indispensable infrastructure or even political entities, making them really powerful.
---
And all those authorities have one thing in common - they estimate the value of our personal data quite much higher
---
than we usually do, for purposes that out of experience i very much doubt are for the better of me.
---
I don't want to be a part of that and retain as much control as i can over my papertrails.
---
Wikipedia says BD is generally the processing of complex, fast-changing incoherent data in huge amounts, so I am not too far off i guess.

It's certainly a good idea if you can :D
---
Tacitcal Supremacy/ The Watchmen/ Dangerous Voltage are 3 AUTZ alliances based in  Legacy coalition space in Catch.
---
There is also Row Row Fight the Power which is a part of TEST.
---
There is an AUTZ corp in GOTG as well that I am aware of
---
Kirin is one of the most fun ships to fly in any fleet, change my mind.
---
Pretty much all the major alliances have somewhat of an UATZ. Darkness/GOTG probably still has the two biggest corps in Kenshin and ANZAC alliance. Tactical Supremacy are fairly large and active in null as well. Otherwise the obvious goons/horde/test if you hate yourself. In WH's Exit Strategy seem pretty cool. In LS you'd probably struggle to find a corp that will take new players without a vouch.
---
Don't be silly.
---
There used to be a list of Aussie corps on http://evedownunder.com/. I don't think the list exists anymore, but you should checkout that website anyway. EVE Downunder is awesome!
---
There is an ingame channel called `EVEDownUnder`, its not a bad place to find an aussie corp suited to you, and just hang out with other aussies and kiwis!
---
If I could do that and live in Iceland I would do it in a heartbeat 
---
Hope you stocked up on hotwings ;)

I need that clip.

The fundamental core balancing of Eve has turned to complete shit. The capital rebalancing, citadels, and basic ship to ship balance has turned to complete shit. 
---
Its great that you didnt play for 3 years and found a couple neat things to rediscover, but frankly people who have been playing for 3+ years dont care at all about what you think about a couple of shiny new features you get to experience.  
---
Also I'd like to see your ingame main character.
---
Much like your posting.
---
Randomly chat on comms while ship spinning?
---
So after the two last Fortizar Timer PanFam whelped 140 bil into, now another 80 bil ? How much do you get from VNI Ratting and Renting these days ?

---
He's the second best FC I'd love to not fly with ever again.
---
For us, yeah! heh
---
Wardecs were changed recently and corps that don't own any structures are not eligible as wardec targets. It would now be OK for incursion runners to form corps, since they're protected from wardecs as long as they don't deploy any structures (which seems reasonable since incursion running is fairly nomadic).
---
holy crap, was that a minor panfam fleet win? 
---
Being dissatisfied with the direction CCP is taking the game is just part of the bittervet cycle
---
Go play something else for six hours, six days, six weeks, or six months, and then come back to EVE
---
You'll be amazed at how all the things you hated are now overshadowed by all the ways CCP made the game worse while you were gone
---
You guys clearly don't know how to Delve.
---
Rewards for activating 2FA and regularly changing your password are something we've suggested internally a few times. 
---
A couple of other gaming companies actively do this already, and it seems to work.
---
I'll bring it up again with the relevant people/
---
First thing you have to do is find what you enjoy doing, and then find other people that enjoy that same thing. Hell, if you find cool people to hang out with you'll enjoy the parts of Eve that "suck" (mining, sov warfare) because you'll have fun screwing around in comms for hours while doing whatever tedious task that is. If you're not having fun, find a new group or new activity. This community has a bad habit of immediately pointing new players towards the big blocs, but there are hundreds of corps/alliances out there willing to take in and help newbros. Right now any 'successful' group requires both a combat and an industry/logistics side, so you'll find a spot/something to do if you join any kind of organized unit. 
---
From your description of combat, it sounds like you're doing something wrong! The only time combat should be boring is when you're in a large strat op/CTA fleet as a DPS and you're anchored on FC pressing F1 when he says, or when you're doing boring parts of PvE. While having more SP helps, don't mistake more SP/ISK for skill. I've played this game for 9 years, I have lots of SP/ISK, and I still get facerolled in PvP that comes down to my skill versus the other person's skills. I've seen really good pilots split groups apart and pick people off, or small groups cause giant headaches and wipe out larger groups. 
---
Eve isn't for everyone. If you required to be spoonfed information/content, Eve will be very hard for you. I've seen in my own corp recently two new guys go completely different routes. The first new guy dipped into every aspect and really learned the game, and climbed his way up to leadership position of the biggest corp in our alliance over 7 months due to his eagerness, effort, and commitment to the corp. Another new guy who started the same time as him was completely clueless and out of the loop, completely ignoring all of Discord/organization and never taking part of corp/alliance stuff, only to be full of questions anytime something big happened (and freaking out from losing a VNI because they had no clue we were at war). 
---
Lastly, you don't need more than 1 account for this game. 
---
Just use two MCTs. The interface is actually quite well designed, it will let you choose if you want the 2nd MCT to just extend your 2nd queue, or if you want it to activate your third queue.
---
Cheers for that! Ill take a look!
---
1 ) Join Dreddit
---
2)  Train the newbro TEST Crucifier fit
---
3)  go on on fleets in your new doctrine ship
---
4)  Train something better (harpy)
---
So basically what brisc has said to you three times now that you are saying he is not? you have to make your mind up and stop huffing grrr goons all the fucking time you meatball (grrr goons).
---
So no evidence then, gotcha.
---
&gt; CCP its time to stop treating goons unfairly
---
looooooool idk even 
---
And then you guys ate shit in the following months down south, what with doomchinchilla promising to evict TEST and so on.
---
it will be fun.
---
Rather predictably TAPI will only commit if you answer the phone.
---
I dont think you could be more wrong but nice try. 
---
Hey PGL I'd love to join every  single one of your fleets but some days I just have to get shit done &lt;3
---
Stuff died, mine more Mex
---
I mean, he's really good FC for a TAPI member
---
If you just take a month or so out from training your exploration gubbins to train one or two always useful ships you'll... always be useful. Massive blobs don't care about what you specialise in, just that you're a warm body in an appropriate ship when it's important. Getting the skills for that really won't take long at all.
---
Uh... hope you are okay dude. Get better soon if you got injured (hopefully not).
---
Whats your main character?
---
- "who the fuck is broadcasting the target? Oh, it was me"   
---
Literally a "I was there" module - it's a heavily nerfed TP designed purely to get on killmails.
---
Most times I forget to use it entirely on my fleets; I only ever really lock targets to monitor that they are dying (Ha, Monitor, get it).
---
Something something goons something something sneaking pictures into childs backpack

Aridia currently is LSH domain iirc.
---
I appreciate the fact that progodlegend gives his fleet three whole days to get good.
---
I was thinking a while what is different between EVE and games like Elite or even scams like Star Citizen - and why subreddit for ED feels different and is different.             
---
Then i played bit of both ( yes i got scammed on SC i know ... trust me i know)            
---
While in both cases there is lack of serious player vs player conflicts 'heating up the atmosphere' of all actions - everything what is good in both cases come from the player community engaged by the community teams.                  
---
You can feel this especially in ED.            
---
People are requesting support ... and get it, but in form of a joke or RP text - that is posted on reddit and every one laugh (post get to top post of this day)       
---
&gt;What EVE have? Policy forbidding posting any communication under possibility of permanent ban.            
---
People find something new hidden by the devs - and it is named based on this find. We get again reddit post that gets to the top post. Player community is cheering and everyone is happy.         
---
&gt;Do you remember Caroline Star? It was big event requiring a lot of work, but fact is that it occupied community during it, and long time after - people are still coming from time to time hoping they found something.                  
---
There are also sad situations when someone from community die - we are not getting any younger, and spend to much time before the computer. ED changes names of planets, nebulas, stations ... we have "Cyno up events" this unites everyone.              
---
&gt;We truly lack a way to commemorate in more permanent way those people in EVE. Even eve cemetery died - what is quite sad.       
---
EVE fails at community aspect of the game (don't get me wrong i don't say that you don't do something bad - but we need big and active team as EVE is a community based game).         
---
The best prof was during this recent "slave revolt" and way someone from CCP picked up the player started narrative.         
---
There was a lot of good posts about this later - and good posts are happy community.          
---
People were not posting about EVE issues but about how Concord was bad and how it was favoring one side.         
---
Next example was when we had those bots teleported to higsec.      
---
Many people were happy, posting about it in a good way - and 90% bad posts after it was about ... that it stopped.             
---
Eve player-base is small, but like any community it need friends and enemies and leaders.                
---
If there will be no external enemy presented, internal ones will be found.            
---
&gt;something about Star Citizen and venture and how this played out - or fact that when stuff destabilized during Christmas - New Year period people wanted fixes when most of the devs/ccp personnel was with their families.         
---
Like imagine yourself if someone just posted around that there is a Grinch in CONCORD that tries to ruin 'Christmas EVE' by scrambling 'Communications arrays' across New Eden.        
---
Make few post ... keep the narrative ... just to let EVE players to hunt for this bad Grinch in the begging of January ... white a huge capital battle at the end where CCP employees will be fighting a capital fleet together with players.          
---
But i guess you know about it - yet CCP as a company lack the vision or should i say ignore fact that most of the current eve players are not those who started to play in 2003.            
---
That's actually cool, but they have to make it official ffs.
---
Its cute you felt the need to say that honey.
---
It's not pedantic or overly specific. It's what the guy said.
---
15-16yrs ago, the folks at CCP had a dream. In that dream they opened up a closed alpha and had weekly and sometimes daily chats to talk about issues within the game and a semi somewhat reporting system that sometimes did and did not work (who remembers typing out about an hours play and what your experiences were only to hit submit and for it to say "error submiting report"?. The game devs at the time would change things two to three times a day just to see what would and would not work and the affects it had and then discuss it with the testers.
---
The game once it went live had it's problems but the devs were around, would listen and engage and would rightly so sometimes give shit back which was different at the time but neseccary sometimes to get over the REEEEEEE that happened from time to time.
---
The point is they actually engaged and listened, something that has become lost, something that would happen over a day or two for a change then became a week, which then went to a couple of weeks, then a month etc etc, you see where I am going with it. The communication went aswell along the same time frames. No longer was it to engage and get feedback and fix things but it became a sense of "whatever, we are right you are wrong because we are the devs". Bad decisions and stupid community replies became the norm and the playerbase has felt pretty helpless.
---
A few scandals later with the likes of T20 and others CCP lost the plot and went full retard only to later try and reedem themselves which takes us more to present day and more stupid decisions.
---
CCP tried in a way to throw the playerbase a bone at one point along the way and created the CSM. CCP being CCP never listened to the playerbase in that the CSM would be by far and large pretty useless and would be abused by larger entities and that forward knowledge would be leaked to help players ingame (it's happened what, 3-4 times now?).
---
EvE players being EvE players have always pushed what is possible in this "sandbox" and that extends outside of the game also with forum after forum succumbing to scandals/hacks/epic salt level stuff and that pretty much brings us to now where as a playerbase we still feel ignored, CCP finally after 10months admitting to a failure but not yet fully commiting to putting it to bed and starting again. Supers and Titans still being mass produced (ccp said players will never manage this remember?) badly needed core game mechanics still botched and half assed repaired to tide us over.
---
We as players are rarely going to be satisfied but one thing that CCP could INFINITLY do better is communicate to the playerbase in a much better way, they killed off a community team for the love of god which says volume of their contempt of the playerbase! People like Verone, Kil2 and players from the past who have went to CCP and left have all taken the brunt over the years from us and it's unfair to them but at the same time they are the "face" of it. Hell, If it was Verones job to be the man we talked to in a channel all day or forum or twitter where he answered or any other CCP employee then we would actually be happier I reckon! but untill CCP actually give a damn then it's not going to happen and no amount of bitchin/posting in forums/complaining at player gatherings is going to fix one of the BIGGEST issues that CCP continue to ignore!
---
wrong corp mate. i love new players because they are eager and can participate in any fleet there is.
---
But you continue to post here and log in everyday? Are you trapped or somehthing? 
---
Tell us about the result... If you survive it ;)
---
Michael1995 Alexa next pls
---
I want that alarm. Does..anyone have that sound clip?
---
Lol
---
all the problems started when we started to bring PVErs closer to PVP. now we have those mouth breathing f1 monkeys that turned engaging and emergent pvp gameplay into a disgusting killmail farmville
---
&gt; **abo**solutly
---
ಠ_ಠ
---
For a minimal amount of ships to train go for: amarr frigate, caldari destroyer, gallente and minmatar cruiser.
---
Frig gives you interceptor, bomber, assault frig. Retribution is the most versatile for pvp and abyss
---
Cal des, for jackdaw and cormorant
---
Gal crui , for vni, duh
---
Min crui, muninn
---
I mean I am not going to tell you that. I am in a small / medium pirate alliance in low sec. I FC (probably poorly) my own small gang fleets and most of the stuff I do is in 3-20 man fleets although we do have larger alliance size engagements. I am not a null rank and file member although I was part of Gents a long time ago that stuff no longer interests me, I like roaming into null just not living there under a large bloc. 
---
I appreciate I have been away for a while but many of the problems I see being talked about are variations on problems that have been around since I started playing many years ago. I dont see them as game breaking and although I may not agree with all the changes that have happened I do not think CCP is wrong for trying to change things. 
---
EVE is old, much older than most games and I should imagine its a struggle to work out what they should be doing to keep the game going. 
---
I have relatively few gripes with the game, tbh.
---
I'm quite enjoying eve at the moment.
---
PL deploy only caps and not supers on the border of Legacy space -&gt; get destroyed by supers
---
TEST deploy only caps and not supers on the border of PanFam space -&gt; get destroyed by supers
---
Man blob warfare is so much fun.
---
Where are the hotwings?
---
Yet we rarely ever say it. I have no friends interested in the game due to the boring sperg posted on here daily about the game dying 
---
Maybe don't form 800 guys for a French newbie alliance lol
---
'Cause UALX didn't have many supers...
---
Can't say I blame them. If I had to start over from scratch... I wouldn't - I'd find a different game to play.
---
If that was true it would be really easy to shut me up. 
---
delivering a working product to your (very) loyal customer base is also a virtue.
---
(especially since CCP didn't get the reputation for putting out quality content the last couple of years)
---
imho your apologia attitude is the real problem. i already said it a few months ago but this sub is getting closer to SC level of shills everyday
---
I'm now a fan o Tristan with salvage drones. Get to mtu where all the wrecks are, press F and watch youtube. Also I think it's faster than nereus with 8 salvagers. But it's my personal feeling.
---
Your brains leaking out your ear
---
How dare you call killmail whoring pointless?
---
How else do we measure our worth?? Paps? Who can yell the loudest? 
---
Tell me!
---
Am i getting my order of events mixed up? Pretty sure it was the hakonen thing and then ncpl goes south, then ualx?
---
He is referring to Providence, prior to our deployment to Tenerifis and fighting in UALX. Calm yourself. 
---
Literally every major block deployment.
---
We all would, who the hell wants to start from scratch? This attitude is why we have let down the game as a community though. Unfortunately what happens when entitled shits pretend to grow up.
---
You are confusing two different issues here my friend. The shitty bittervet attitude has grown over many years because of many many long lasting reasons.
---
The one you are currently addressing is not "snowflake solutions" it's one of the bittervet reasons that he is saying is his reason, "not listening". I do not agree with it being an icelandic problem as stated by him since CCP has many people from many different countries working there.
---
With regards to sickness that you mentioned, well with subscriber/player count that has been in decline for years the game is not dead but not thriving either and ccp's advertising of massive player battles and then players doing it and the servers pretty much grinding to a halt is no way to advertise and keep a playerbase and it shows in player numbers.
---
Maybe instead of "Fuckoff with your toxic posting, and maybe play a different game if you aren't happy." you should try actually having a conversation about it instead of trying to suggest getting rid of another player not of the same viewpoint as yourself as we really do need everyplayer we can if we want to keep the game alive.
---
Using member count as an assessment of actual membership is pretty much the worst possible metric available. By your logic, Brave has 2/3 the capability of Horde because they have 8k dudes, even though about 80% of that 8k is inactive.
---
No there was a 8 month period in Curse and Providence prior to deploying to Tenerifis a then a further four weeks til UALX but you call it how you think you saw it. 
---
Yes and UALX required all PL and east groups supers to be deployed to end up in somewhat of a stalemate where not much was achieved because supers fighting is just a big stick of who has the most. So my point still stands : Blob warfare is so much fun.
---
How'd those go, im OOL here
---
IT'd be great to get one for other ammo too :) 
---
Why would they leave it with 1% structure?
---
Had a blast last night, 80+ ppl on policecomms and got some good fights! 
---
Crawl back inside your wormhole then. 
---
&gt; However, I fear that the path I have chosen may be completely useless in the grand scheme of a corp. Almost everyone talks about having to farm SP for interdictor ships, huge industrials and so on for benefitting the corp and something tells me that an ultra-specialized player with his exploration vessel would be useless.
---
Being in a big newbro corp is like having a citizenship in a country imo. Do you want to go explore relic/data sites? Do it, with a horde/test/goon passport in your coat.
---
You can engage in mostly all activities you'd enjoy, you'll be presented various unique opportunities for example to make isk, and you'll have a bunch of bittervets at arms length who can help you with theory if you need it. In turn, well, some contribution is expected, like, go to an important fleet each month, which in turn helps to your alliance, your 'country'. And it can also happen that you'll enjoy these.
---
Worst case, you got bored and drop corp.
---
The problem is, these are not their own chatservers. They thought outsourcing mission critical infrastructure was a good idea.
---
I just wish there was more. I could watch hours of this. 
---
You can join wh Corp and live in a place you like. Of course you'll probably need to learn to fly some ships but it's a part of the game out of hs where you want to defend your space.
---
From other hand I know scanning chains is a big thing so if you're the scout going around and mapping wh connections everyone will be grateful. 
---
Now this is a helpful post, basically you just represent the opposite site of the medal the "shitty bittervet" does. As always truth lies in between you both, EVE isn't dead but it is also not in its best shape.
---
It has nothing to do with entitlement.
---
It has everything to do with the fact that back then, all those years go, eve had little to no competition and I had significantly more free time to establish my pilots.
---
These days? I don't have as much time, and there are a lot more and higher quality alternatives than there were 5, 10, or 15 years ago.
---
Well, that seems fair.
---
What would you suggest as a first corp for a beginner as of now? I couldn't wrap my head around the billion of acronyms on the net for EVE corporations whose scope, tactics and interests changed so much in the last years that almost every thread can be considered outdated...
---
Yeah, only retards say that word
---
There's two I know of in Darkness, Kenshin and Anzac Alliance
---
Per definition of today balance, if the defending alliance isn't shit there isn't much a subcap deployment would do, and a subcap one except maybe a successful dread bomb or two is most likely to end in supers being dropped. And super deployment mean a full cluster-wide escalation with everyone involved.
---
Lol like? 
---
I only crawl back to get another ship and get out of my WH again.
---
My corp in init is 70% australian : https://evewho.com/corp/InterSun+Freelance
---
We are a small corp and nice people :=)
---
Apparently not. 
---
Look at games like warframe, path of exile, etc.
---
Free, well made, frequently updated. They're popular for good reason. Hell these are the things eve players are already playing while their VNI is grinding through yet another forsaken hub.
---
Think they'd really miss eve all that much if it upped and vanished tomorrow?
---
Complete and utter difference in gameplay/ experience. If your leaving Eve for those then your time in the sandbox is over my friend. 
---
&gt; I was kicked from an alliance for buying and dropping it a fort ... I ended up selling the fort to some neuts
---
I don't know the details but those sequence of events regardless of what happened in the middle are the reason a lot of alliances are ultra sketchy about letting people drop structures willy nilly in their space.
---
Karmafleet is a decent starting corp. The thing about goonswarm though, is that most of the action is in special interest groups, your corp doesnt matter for that kind of content. You can explore the universe to your hearts content with a goonswarm passport.
---
Quick everyone get onboard, we are going to the hot page ! 
---
No it isn't. Not completly. We are resisting. They think it's their domain.  We are at war with them. 
---
If your titan pod is only 3.1 bill you doing it wrong ...
---
Amazing work
---
Just imagine BOAT, just less cringy stories
---
Please stop posting
---
Eve is a sandbox. If you're interested in getting involved in the big alliance warfare, you can join any of those large alliances (TEST, Goons, Pandemic Horde, Brave). You will be able to join their fleet, receive free new player ships and be somewhat useful. But some people like that, because they are guided and like being part of the large entity who achieve its goal by the sum of its players involvement. Some people don't like been a pawn and being told what to do and play other ways. You might like it, you might not, in any case Eve is large, complex and varied, there are plenty of different groups playing in different ways, so if it's not for you, you can always change your mind.
---
Is joining a large group the best way to understand a lot more what's going on ? Yes and no. Most of my knowledge comes from reading r/eve, and there are some groups I've never been involved with or against I direct IG contact with, be it in a campaign or even one large fight, and yet I can explain to you what is there "recent" history. Yet joining a group and participating in some events helps you get a much better idea of what's going on and, to some extend, be the one sharing the knowledge on reddit or elsewhere. It rarely is the details you can provide that will change everything, you can just see from the battle report who more or less won, basic context like "this was XYZ alliance staging area" and stuff like that to know why it is a sifting event in the grand scheme of things.
---
Here is a least of reasons :
---
- Entosissing a system is boring as fuck and is basically a game of ceptors moving between nodes to kill entosis ships before the other side can catch them. It's mostly very boring.
---
- There is no point in invading space if you already have your own. The largest entity in the game is leaving from almost only one region and has established a really large industrial empire. This is mostly due to NS ratting and mining sites respawning quite fast.
---
- Shooting structures is boring and unless you have a very large amount of titans or supers on it, at the defenders advantage.
---
- You can try and roam your enemy space to hunt their farmers, but first those big ships are hard to catch and to kill. If they aren't retarded, they are just going to lit their cyno and bring in carriers, FAXes and supers to save them. Rorquals in particular are just so hard to kill because of PANIC, the ability to put excavator drones in a WETU so even if you kill them it's only half the real value, and heavy drones being pretty strong at clearing tackle.
---
1) because it devalues old trained characters
---
2) because the ability of creating full trained characters from 0 in no time as you wish was never the spirit of this game. 
---
You should have to take your time and learn the ropes as we used to, before injectors existed.
---
No it is not.       
---
Because EVE space is **NOT** equally seeded with systems.     
---
This is not a "PVE content" that you run in a paladin or a golem but you utilize whole fleet or big jump capable ships.            
---
When you want to do it you are checking **how many mids, or titan bridges** it is from you. 
---
This is why current mechanic is so unbalanced, in the south east you have usually part of a region covered up from a single location :            
---
(some examples)

---
but i guess looking on the eve map is enough to see the issue.         
---
if you look at area split by NPC pirate race you will see that utilizing this is much, much more fair when it comes to a players as then every one will have much more equal chance of getting a spawn in the area they are living or in neighboring region.          
---
/u/ccp_falcon can someone please look at this.        
---
Just add 1 more random. Randomize Race where it can spawn and then system within this race.        
---
If for example "Sansha Nation" is choosed it then will randomize in one of the systems in Providence/Catch/Stain/Esoteria or Paragon Soul.        
---
I can't. I was wrong. Sad.
---
Games are just a way to have some fun while passing time. 
---
It doesn't matter if a game is different, if people would rather spend their time playing it, they will.
---
Had this happen to me as well in a particualr system always near a planet. This massive FPS drop was also happening to my corp mates. For us the solution was to disable asteroid environments in dispaly and graphics settings. 
---
A POS takes 15 minutes to anchor, a citadel takes 24h before ADMs. The last POS functionality yet to be replaced is the ability to stage out of a quick forward base like that. 
---
not really, his pod is perfectly standard
---
I FC my self now and then so i just link any kills by anyone in fleet and take credit for those.. BAM!
---
Because you're contradicting yourself, that's where I'm struggling. The broad issue here is that there a bunch of middle aged guys that genuinely think moaning about stuff 24/7 on public forums is a way of making them feel better. If you put this time towards your family and partner you wouldn't be sat on a video game crying about how shit it is in the first place. 
---
What's POCO?
---
Any corp that makes their members work for them sucks. Not supposed to be like that. Go join a Null bloc, Goons/test/brave/PH (im sure im missing some others? ) 
---
Reason to do this is the isk per hour you can make is drastically higher. You can krab for a few hours then you will have all the money you need to go buy whatever you want and go solo pvp in it. My favorite times in eve is when I am hunting/welping solo in a cool ship. 
---
I do not think any of the bigger alliences will force their members to do their bidding when they are online, generally they will just expect you to do some fleets and pvp. 
---
As for fleet pvp, unless it is one of the epic battles I still prefer to play tackle since it's just the most fun, despite the fact that I can fly almost everything. 
---
You don't need  80mil SP to enjoy the game. You just need your core skills up and from there on you are sorted. Give the game another try, but find new people. Heck see if you can do a heist of a corp's assets.. nobody will suspect the noobie of doing that.  Create your own content. 
---
To be honest, that happens in nearly all game subs.
---
If you are based near jita, ingame mail me what you can fly and ill send you some fitted pvp ships to go lose gloriously. 
---
Lt Motion
---
ISK = SP, meaning there is no longer a hard limit on how quickly a new player can become a titan or super pilot. 
---
This creates an environment where the best solution to get the most amount of super pilots is to literally encourage everyone to rat 24/7 and well that's kinda the current eve meta.
---
screamer at 2:26 be ware

I'm just back playing after a 4 year hiatus and I agree that the game is simply amazing, so much has changed I almost feel like a noob, but flying around blackrise and that general warzone area in a frig is fun as fuck! FoRed a Corp with an old buddy that just came back too and we'll see how it goes.
---
You make it sound like I give a shit...
---
Pick a beginner corp based on the culture of its alliance, is my advice. Look up Test, Pandemic Horde and Goonswarm, reddit/youtube/google, maybe spend a day or two with this, and go.
---
pod worth around 5-10% value of the front line ship is ok i guess.
---
reddit isn't designed for thoughtful commentary. it's designed to show you the most popular outcome; the same old tired jokes
---
it's literally the worst platform for discussion on a game that goes completely against what the average gamer wants i.e. call of duty &amp; world of warcraft
---
this triggers me
---
If you like exploration, look into signal corp. They are non-aggressive though.
---
Dude, I already fucking told you that I have very few gripes with the game and that I enjoy playing it.
---
There's nothing confusing about that statement.
---
&gt;Tell that to fade, pure blind, and the faction titans of NC that will never see the light of day again.
---
&gt;with this shitty mechanics you win if you make your enemies stop logging/contesting.
---
Gj
---
Also citadel damage against caps is bonkers. Bringing in dreads at 0 gets you deleted. The only way is LR Phoenix (maaaaybe other dreads, but Phoenix is by far the best for it) so you can rep outside of neut range.
---
explo ships are great
---
give connections and intel to your corpmates that are interested in hunting, you get to explore and get dank null/wh explo loot and the people hunting in your corp/alliance will be grateful
---
## Eve Action News at 11: PanFam WTB Titan fleet there for we can DD some dreads ''FC HELP'' we need back up fast jump all things in now.
---
We will keep you updated  
---
\- see you soon   
---
\- Reporter sue abbott  
---
You look more grr Olmec than I am grr goons
---
It helped a lot that the 'coalition' you were taking it from were massive krabs with low average combat experience, some of which had recently been evicted elsewhere.
---
They were really bad and basically never tried to stop you.
---
Thats the best way to do it, I loved running my own corp/alliance a few years back. That being said I decided to join another group this time and its working out pretty well. 
---
I heard it was possible to do this with a carrier but didn't know you could do it with a Dread.  These things are horribly broken aren't they.
---
&gt;definitely I need/want to join a huge newbie corp. 
---
So here are the choices for the big groups.
---
Dreddit (TEST Alliance) - reddit based corp, Largest corp in TEST 3500 players,  for new and old players
---
Brand Newbros (TEST Alliance) - Test newbro corp
---
Brave Newbies (Brave collective) - Large corp specifically founded for new players to shoot stuff, Allied with TEST in the Legacy coalition
---
KarmaFleet (Imperium) - The Imperiums/Goons corp for newbros, part of the biggest Alliance in the game
---
Pandemic Horde (Panfam) - Takes anyone almost instantly, Huge  corp, Has the veteran alliances of Pandemic Legion and NC. to back them up.
---
Basically the 3 big groups are , Legacy, Imperium and Panfam. Its up to you which you join.
---
Dam you seem mad.....
---
we had less supercaps and won handily so there goes that theory
---
Ships don’t build and pay for themselves. Before anoms became the null profit centre people still krabbed but they were doing it on L4 hisec alts, then incursion alts, market trader alts. CCP wanted null to have some value for line members to move and live in null fulltime as l4 hisec running was pretty much risk free so they tied the ADM sov mechanic to krabbing, to reinforce your sov it became an imperative to krab up the ADM’s and maintain them rather than a handful of super rich alliance guys just printing moongoo money. This benefited large alliance groups with huge industry backbones against small nomadic groups like PL. The more space you take the more krabbimg you have to do for the ADM’s. It may appear as if the entire of null has gone carebear but the reality is that it’s mostly off duty pvp’rs alt armies and since large alliance warfare is now a battle of attrition then having a strong industrial backbone with SRP funded by ratting taxes is the only way to fund warfare.
---
I honestly don’t know why people complain so much, it’s been proven the more isk players can make the more likely they are to risk assets since they can be replaced. We’d never see the scale and frequency of battles we have done without SRP and krab farms. The only people bitching are the solo/small gang types who clearly don’t engage in as much PvP as they claim or are secret krabbers. So the answer is in CCP adding the connection of ratting/mining to ADM requiring anyone holding sov to increase defense by krabbing.
---
You mean Goons brought their whole supers fleet which made the node crash and then PL had to back up because Gotg and NC were eating shit up north ?
---
Daily reminder of spodbrain

suggests nothing but null corps 
---
Tapi Poster btw
---
The author himself posted his work here exactly two weeks ago, and what everyone told him was to watch his back to not get hammered by CCP lawyers over copyright.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/a9msgo/eve_adventures_a_new_eden_tabletop_game/
---
And I echo here what I told him then. Forcing capsuleers into classes and not having a solid but visceral tactical combat system like X-Wing hampers the flow of the game. 
---
The game would benefit plenty if it explored the EVE universe using characters other than capsuleers (such as DUST soldiers, Valkyrie pilots and Gunjack miners) to explore New Eden in a narrative focused game, using a rule set like D20 Modern.
---
Does he welp every fleet he bring out of home system too?
---
If your interested in wormhole space I'd check out Spoopy Newbies
---
So, whenever PGL says warp to something, he follows it up with "oh shit, if you warped you're dead!"?
---
Or he is just welping every fleet he brings out of home?
---
Yeah, was fun fighting you guys as always! 
---
&gt;definitely I need/want to join a huge newbie corp.
---
There is literally no such thing as a huge WH group
---
maybe because you had not been playing with alts until that day.
---
Dead Coalition (what used to be called GOTG) is TBH the best place to situate yourself in AUTZ. Its main allaince,  Darkness has two rather large mainly (80+%) AUTZ Corps, Kenshin and ANZAC Alliance - I have been in both (and currently with Kenshin), and both are a great bunch of dudes.
---
The best thing about DeadCo/Darkness - Our AUTZ is one of the bigger ones in the game, so all of our structure/sov is timed to that, which means in any conflict there is a shit load of content for us while you get to laugh at everyone sperging on here about timezone tanking.
---
As the group who did 99% of the work on this sotiyo, he jumped in after some peasants tried to tackle our supers. You can in fact run the in bling dreads/carriers/fax.... but it is extremely tough. Most people run then in 2x titans or 2-6 supers. He did the final 1%after we bailed. And yes the high majority of these only spawn in east and north regions of eve. The spawn percentage by region is not balanced and it is not an even chance to every 0.0 system. 
---
The Sony Vegas watermark is what sells it.
---
Lmao, look how many sneaky ninja looting DST's there were
---
Hasn't that been the case for the last 10 years anyway?
---
Read the post and was like, this must be stainguy 
---
*Wasn't disappointed*
---
no i mean between our supercaps, and the goons' shield supercaps (the only goon supers that made it on grid in UALX before the node crash btw), we were outnumbered by about 20 titans. 
---
nc. fleet was in range btw but like goons, didn't make it onto the grid before it crashed
---
That's an interesting spin on it, lets see how many revolutions you get.
---
According to intel HK an form 350 by themselves thats pretty huge for wspace if you ask me!

Ok, let’s assume...for a minute...that my flair *isnt* bait.

Who the fuck is he and why should I care? Educate me.

Can you blame them?  1 shot at a 300 billion drop.  I'm surprised there aren't 4,000 people in local.
---
I think you miss the point of krabbing. The vast majority of PvP players don’t enjoy or want to do PVE activities, it’s purely a grind for currency to fund their PvP content, be it buying skill injectors, or funding supers and titans. The smart way to grind is the minimal effort for maximum return so leaving rorq’s to mine or vni’s to rat is the best way to earn isk while you do something more enjoyable. If you run abyssal for 3 solid years then you’ll be bored to tears - that’s how the majority of PvP guys feel about all PvP content. I grinded through 35 billion of L4 running to buy my first Nyx and when I was done I was so bored I quit for 3 years. If I actually had to run abyssal or other PVE content to make ISK i’d quit for good because like every PVE activity in Eve once you figure out the min/max trick it just becomes a repetitive slog. In any case there is no enforced playstyle in Eve - miners get a lot of hate but the fact is without miners you’ve got no basic materials to build ships with, the more PvP there is the more materials need to be mined, not everyone wants to mine so ratting provides a income stream to combat trained pilots that don’t want to put sp into Indy skills. Eve only works at all because different players do different activities - if nobody ran missions there would be no lp items from factions or pirate stores. Without salvagers there would be no rigs, without inventors no bpc’s, and without haulers nothing would move. This idea of all players doing 23/7 PvP has never been the Eve model and the players who demand that playstyle are likely the ones who play casually enough to fund off buying plex not the bulk of the playerbase who commit years to the game. By design Eve is closer to empire building games like Civ than a space shooter and the whole sov model is a long form game of command and conquer not call of duty in space.

Okay, I thought this sub was complaining about 240million ticks with super rattling.  Is it 240 million per hour then?

Bonus points for the music.

Would have been a good post if it wasnt the 2nd or 3rd time youve posted this (or pinged CSM discord about it)

Have you heard about lowsec gate to Stain?
---
Learn to key bind you fucking pleb
---
Don’t get it , what do the regions have to do with it ? since they spawn everywhere 
---
Mainly the shouting at people followed by friendly banter moments later
---
It looks like an even chance per system simply some areas have much more heavily seeded in systems.         
---
Me again trying to fix it and let players around New Eden have the same chance for a spawn :      
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/aeuhed/so_when_we_are_talking_about_npc_sotiyos_again/
---
Looong Time Ago in 2004 i played with some people up in the north, mostly germans, and found out that one of them living like 10km near my hometown. so we started to go out and go drinking, having fun in RL and Stuff.
---
2 years ago i became the godfather of his little small daughter and last year he was my best man on my wedding, thats what i called friendship is the best ship
---
Then how does NCDocked still have space?
---
... i'd give praise if there was any to give. you might have fun in the current interation of EVE. But so many people left over the changes in the last years which has to be obvious that not everyone is having as much fun as you are having a couple of days after coming back from winning eve.
---
This game has almost nothing left resembling the eve i grew to love
---
Very nice video.
---
Have you heard about fair NPC Sotiyo spawns?
---
Be nice if csm would do something and get it fixed then. Not hard to see un even spawn rates
---
If you don't have much time, I would not recomment to live solo in a WH. There is a lot of "work" to do (scanning and rolling) before you start to earn money or do PVP adventures. You'll have to do it all alone. 
---
If you are in a group, the work is shared, much less to do for each individual. The smaller the corp. the more important are you for others and the more you have to rely on schedules of others. So if you are very occupied in real life, you should look for a big corp.
---
Thats what I thought.
---
It can actually work but you have to not just think you can beat the other side. Every deployment that gets fucked is because someone is WAY too confident that their enemy is retarded.
---
Wait, isn't this just another repost?
---
reddit shitposts achieved quite a lot in regards to CCP fixing shit...not sure you are right there
---
I think this whole narrative of BB not being neutral and so on and the whole pushing of goon pilots to get him banned, makes me think that those public fleets of bombers really seems to hurt (at least some) goon miners' income. 
---
Basically they are doing god's work.
---
I just find it hard to believe given where they have spawned since ccp's changes. 
---
The best advice I can give you is play Eve the way you want to play and enjoy it. Any corp that tries to enforce a playstyle on you against your will is not a Corp you want to join. You’ll meet a lot of space Hitler CEO’s who think they have a right to dictate what you do or don’t do in game just to be a yesman member of their little club, but the reality of this game is the only Corps that last are the ones that work for the members not the other way round. Having all your players ragequit or awox your Titan builds is a symptom of poor management and social skills which is to be expected as a lot of space nerds lack the sort of people skills that make good leaders and simply attract talent based on ticker epeen. Don’t listen to the echo chamber that only small nanogang pvp’rs are ‘good’ at Eve, the game is full of thousands of pilots quietly doing their thing be it exploring, building things, trading or mining and there is no right or wrong way to play, the only important thing is to enjoy what you do enough to keep coming back. It’s YOUR time, YOUR  sub money and YOUR  game, corps exist to allow people who share the same interests and goals to work together, they don’t simply serve as a ego platform for their CEO’s. Post in the recruitment thread and on the forum recruitment telling people what you like to do, timezone and what you want to achieve in Eve and you might be surprised to find a corp out there who’ll support you. 
---
As far as I know Goons moved to assist TAPI because NC were moving to assist PL - or NC moved to assist PL because Goons were moving to assist TAPI.  Anyway they arrived at pretty much the same time on different gates.  I don't think Goons had much affect on the fight itself, though we certainly did on the strategic situation as we deployed North a short while later, forcing PL to retreat.
---
I don't know, I'm just an F1 monkey.  That is how I saw it at the time.
---
Small hint its in the numbers posted, you will understand if you know basic school math.
---
Has /u/Stainguy ran out of shitposts? Is he just recycling them now?
---
While I do believe that joining a corp is the way to go in EVE, lets not forget that you can have a lot of fun PVP with the various NPSI fleets.
---
When has suicide ganking ever actually been nerfed? 
---
Explo in a big null corp is kind of like sex. Pretty much everybody you know there does it and sometimes they even talk about it, but predominantly it's just you and a few wormholes having a good time together on your own. Does it help the corp? Well corp mates get a good list of wormholes and sites you discover and have had first crack at so that maybe they might try their luck sometime. And some daring explorers even team up and share the booty... I guess, though I think most that brag about gang explo just say that to sound interesting but really they are back in the station spinning their ship alone. 
---
The point is... the explo part itself probably isn't much different but you'll have more friends and perks to fly home to as well as other activities to do for when some bitchy sleeper site ruins you for other sites or you find yourself slouching through a long dry spell of shit data site drops.
---
No matter what, use protection out there! A cloaking device may save your life someday.
---
was this a reffed node, though? was at least somewhat less awful TIDI than last time
---
Our super fleet would match the first goon escalation, but not the second. Also worth considering is how many titans were effective in our group.
---
The spawn rates are way too high.  They should be super rare and also heavily contested. For this reason I think upon initial discovery their location should be publicly available.  It should be impossible for a cloaky to snipe the drop;  right now that's far too easy.  Some other way of determining who gets the drop over "just keep the location secret" should be implemented.  It should be impossible to cap the thing with a single carrier or dread. 
---
That's what I think about that.  Thanks.
---
a couple? lol
---
NC started moving about 10 minutes after goons, goons arrived about 30 minutes ahead iirc. The real effect was managing to come in in such a way that half our fleet was out of effective range.
---
In the context of the TIDI, being 30 minutes ahead is like being a few seconds ahead.  Also who moved first is quite murky as groups may make decisions based on intel/spies revealing the other is planning to do so.
---
Nah man, I understand industry, but I was of the belief that the majority of industry was done in HS but now it seems that regions like delve are producing just as much as the HS Care Bears, I was just wondering when this change happened, or if I’ve been retarded and missed it for a while.
---
Quite simple.       
---
Let say that you are randomizing a number between 1 and 100.    
---
In theory every number have the same chance.         
---
So lets do a lottery, we create 100 tickets aaaannnddd give them to 3 people.       
---
1st guy gets 3 tickets, 2nd guy gets 27 tickets, 3rd guy gets 70 tickets.         
---
Now are those guys still have the same chance of winning ?      
---
If you make 10 rolls there is quite big chance that the guy with 70 tickets will get from 8 to 10 winnings.          
---
Look now on the table above and links to system ranges.             
---
http://evemaps.dotlan.net/range/Archon,5/37S-KO  -&gt;  97 systems in range within 1 region              
---
http://evemaps.dotlan.net/range/Archon,5/2-WNTD -&gt; 216 systems in range within 6 regions             
---
South and West have small number of regions without to much overlapping, quite often none.      
---
North and East have multiple regions overlapping each other.       
---
Whole Sansha space is 448 systems within 5 regions.      
---
Whole Angel space is 912 systems and 12 regions.      
---
The smallest is Blood Raider space 232 systems and 3 regions if you exclude SOE or Mordus. 
---
   
---
Issue is still there. 
---
Yeah. 80 dreads is pretty "oh well."
---
I'm not trying to spin it. Test got thumped. It's just... It's only 150b lost across a large alliance.
---
In order for them to be contested - they should spawn only in NPC areas - because who will contest a NPC sotyio in the middle of the Drone Lands or in places like deep Paragon Soul or Tenal.          
---
NPC space allow people to prepare and store a dread bomb ... and wait for opportunity to fight for it.         
---
hello, i'm retarded and just calling random shitposter retarded offends me
---
Yes i did, tracking them on a daily basis. For last months i know where 95% of spawns locations are and you?
---
I agree, though the dd cycle I assume they got off contributes to mounting losses but not the defined flow of the battle. I was there, we would have prob moved anyway but goons already moving put us on the clock so to say.
---
Fake news is fake :D
---
&gt;I honestly don’t know why people complain so much, it’s been proven the more isk players can make the more likely they are to risk assets since they can be replaced. 
---
How has this been proven? 
---
What evidence are you using how did you compare, what data did you base this one? 
---
Because playing eve is see the exact opposite happen most of the people that rat all day barely show up for fights, the people that tend to do the majority of the fighting tend to be well relatively isk poor because they spent most of there game time pvping. 
---
Blood Raider retard and wannabe
---
What?
---
Dread brawling is one of my favourite things in eve, change my mind.
---
Expect the worst,  and you'll never be disappointed. 
---
What is the chance to spawn a lowsec gate to Stain tho? 🤔
---
Well if a given alliance has an issue with having too few systems, and therefore not getting any sotiyos, they can just go take the "better" sov.. 
---
Generate some content \o/
---
But oh wait they wanted to have those few tightly spaced regions cuz general krabbing is safer.
---
i would think copyright wouldn't be an issue as long as he is not profiting of it.
---
&gt; I'm not spreading any myths, Olmeca. I'm explaining to you how representative democracy works, because you apparently were sick the day the taught civics in middle school.
---
No. You are pushing your American-centric and neo-Republican-centric understanding of how representative democracy is supposed to work as if it's the only way to think about it.
---
&gt; There is no duty to "lead change," unless the people want the change. If they don't, trying to force it is not representing them. There are ways you can nudge folks in the right direction, but if you get out too far ahead of somebody, you're going to end up getting pulled back.
---
Nobody forces anything to anyone. But folks don't know what they want until someone frames an idea and presents it. Take Ocasio-Cortez. Nobody knew what "Green New Deal" is until she began to frame it. Now we are learning it and some of us are liking it. She is leading change. If politicians passively waited for the majority opinion to form, lots of issues many countries already solved would still have not been solved. 
---
&gt; My worldview does not need to align with the folks I represent. I'm going to have opinions that differ, and beliefs that differ. 
---
Never said you have to have entirely the same beliefs or opinions. It is a waste, however, if someone votes for you without you having a more or less aligning political worldview to them. If they want more social security and you want less, they want looser immigration and you want stricter, they want more taxes and you want less, and there are enough differences between you in this manner, then there is no point in that person voting for you just because you listen. 
---
But that's what you keep saying. People should vote for you just because you listen. If what you were saying was true, and any politician could represent anyone as long as they listen, we wouldn't need to know their political leanings before voting for them. They would just do their best to adopt the opinion of the majority of their constituents, then not get elected next time if they fail. But that's not how it works. We know, and are supposed to know, political interests, background and worldview of people we are voting for.
---
Your kind of a "tabula rasa" politician picture is the exact thing politicians who seek power for the sake of power would push for. And that'd be most politicians in US the anyway. It deeply misunderstands democracy, and causes lots of problems in US.
---
Basic Maths 101:  Distribution doesn't affect randomness.
---
In your example let's assume there's only 1 winning number, so a 1% chance to win. It doesn't matter how the numbers are distributed between players: the chances of any given number to be the winning one are still 1/100
---
I would like to say that the Rook and the Navy Griffin in a terrable place atm
---
I mean why fly the GNI when the Navy Comet can do the same if not more (15m3 drones). And the rook doesn't even have a application bonus for HML and HAMs. The Rook feels like it's stuck in 2012 when HML were good and now that i think about it, the only reason to use a rook over the cerb is the d-scan immunity.
---
Td;lr why use a Rook when a curse can shut down almost any subcap and drill a hole in your ass at the same time
---
FREEZE SCUMBAGS, GPD!!
---
Iirc a study recently showed that changing your password regularly just leads to poor security (eg writing it down somewhere so you remember) and doesn’t help with illicit account use. 2FA idea is great though. 
---
Where did i say it is linked with sov?           
---
It is about players having equal chance for a sotyio within 3 mids.     
---
Then they can do it or contest it.          
---
    
---
PGL - "VAHIZ MORTIZ WHY ARE YOU NOT ANCHORED, CAN YOU NOT HEAR ME?"
---
Others - "No, hes deaf FC"
---
PGL - "oh god! he is isnt he!"
---
Gates don't spawn so logically chance for one to spawn is equal to 0%       
---
Your question should be what is the chance for one to be created by CCP - then is equal to awareness of fact that New Eden is lacking one.        
---
nah, we handed them out for free, ask your corpmate :)
---
Player Owned Customs Office
---
look at the 2nd sentence really hard,  notice i don't say test in that one. i say tapi.  
---
that help?
---
Number yes - but in this case i am talking about one of those 3 persons.               
---
This example is about fact that equal chance for each number != equal chance for each person if they have different number of tickets.    
---
Because we have this situation now.          
---
Because "someone" cynoed sabres in on us when we got it to 1%
---
No sir, He stated that he was confident that TAPI would flunk the Invasion because they could be defeated by Horde alone. But in addition to Horde, Panfam would get in on fights too, he was stating that Odds were against TAPI, not that they didn't 'need' Panfam.
---
I'm pretty sure both groups would have moved on the fight anyway. I'm pretty sure Goons had an effect since first there shield fleet was there from almost the beginning and once their armor fleet (and NC fleet too, not sure about that one) arrived, the node crashed (not saying it was the goal).
---
My main point is that the numbers of supers weren't fight-changing different, "20" titans less isn't a whole lot, especially when if I recall correctly supers carriers where on TEST/Goon side, and if I'm not too wrong on numbers, Goons armor fleet would have been in superior numbers to the NC reinforcement.
---
The whole conflict was about supers numbers and the moment PL wasn't there in the south, surprisingly the other side wasn't too keen on fighting none one sided fights, and once TEST was north it wasn't really equals anymore and the conflicts ended.
---
UALX was more of a "shield vs armor" thing but in the end it didn't really matter in the whole conflict. Even if TEST would have been bleeding as many titans as PL&amp;friends, I doubt they would have reloged anyway.
---
amen
---
Cool ty
---
please stop playing again.. thanks
---
Well its related to where said player lives &amp; thereby the sov they live within
---
I was to lazy to do exact math eh ... i guess i need to do it at some point. 
---
So you're tracking the ones on zkillboard. what about all the ones not no zkill?
---
nothing missed. just an other tidi fight 
---
Piggles *giggles*

WAAAHHHHHHHHH MY LESS DENSE SPACE GETS LESS SPAWNS WAAAHHHHHH

Might want to work on your timing with the hull Energizer lol
---
WAAHHHHHHHH OTHER PPL HAVE MORE SOV THAN ME 
---
keep yourself safe retard
---
you, sir, have may downvote -upvote.
---
maybe the game IS bad?
---
Approved because of how retarded this idea is
---
Well if yours isn’t bait, then mine isn’t either /s
---
I agree with pretty much everything you said. Having these be exclusive to NPC null and lowsec makes much more sense from both a balance perspective and from a lore perspective.
---
I hope CCP revisits these one day because the current meta for clearing them is both boring and incredibly favorable for those who have access to multiple titans/supers over any type of subcap fleet.
---
Just to be clear, a single dread cannot run these.
---
It also means absolutely zero time for already glacial ccp to iterate on any change because anyone can react instantly to a change by spamming injectors for either skills on existing characters or new ones entirely. 
---
On that note there’s a thread on the character bazaar selling over 30 “skill farm ready charactarers.” If someone tries to say that isn’t game breaking then they’re truly idiots 
---
maaaybe a single carrier can? its gonna take you like 15 hours though
---
lol you unironically mentioned all the changes that lead to the game getting worse in a post on why the game got better....
---
Isn’t the last E a bit crooked?
---
Thanks again, was awesome.  Was a sight to see how the outnumbered officers fought to the last man standing until being executed by non law abiding hamsters
---
Pee paw Pew paw
---
I sense a big butt hurt here 
---
Butt hurt is strong in you
---
Remember when we used to have massive brawls over mining moons with regularity, all across the game? And then they made everything roughly the same, deleted the resource incentive, and ruined that content source, all because people cried too much about passive income? I remember.
---
I don't track sotiyo kills - most of the kills don't land there. I have my ways.     
---
That is terrible advise.
---
There are also lowsec spawns you know.    
---
Yes, I know what you mean, but you used a logical fallacy to prove a point.
---
So, you say that every player should have equal chance to get a spawn. Sounds nice.. in paper!!
---
What about the people that have worked to have the chances in their favour? Because we all know how that will end: with complaints of the EVE playerbase arguing that change "casualizes" the game, that implies 0 effort and all that jazz  
---
You want to destroy Sotiyos? Work for that goal. You don't like how that gameplay works now? Find another that suits you.  
---
But trying to change CCP decisions is like asking for a lowsec gate to Stain: totally futile ;)  
---
no, a we did the initial ref and then 99% of the hull with a group of 5 supers, then some neutral tried to drop sabres on us at 1% hull so we left, Bongalonga then dropped his own dread to do the last 1% hull
---
Exit strategy is a  autz wormhole alliance 
---
i knew
---
but then ... why bother ?
---
dunno why you’re replying to powers. Just open his post history and it becomes painfully apparent that he has little actual interest in talking about anything 
---
Have you been to the EVE forums?
---
While reddit is pretty bad sometines, at least the user group who participates is more diverse. As in you get a lot small gang, null FC's, f1 warriors, solo, lowsec and even some high sec guys that take part in the discussions. Which can help give better perspective about things.
---
The EVE Forums are full of people who dont post on their mains, troll and have clear lack of understanding basic game mechanics (yes, you could say the same about reddit, but seriously, make a post on the forums and see the kind of brain cell losing responses you get). Its mainly highsec gankers and ratters on the forums.
---
He's cooked mate.
---
&gt; If it were real life you should have actual players try and become part of concord to find and research botters.
---
I wish this was for real.
---
yeah it genuinely offends me that someone can be as dumb as you are and continue breathing 
---
I see you have read "*How to get downvoted into Oblivion 101*"
---
Remember that ccp event where they teleported boting capitals to highsec? Like 70% of them were goons.

---
I've heard rumours about certain glitches I won't go into here.
---
Its unironically easier to kill an alliance than to evict one.
---
Then I would liek to know how many I an Skillurself has run (since you got your ways;) )
---
Well on one hand people dont have time to wait one whole subscription price to train a skill to level 5 but I agree that it devalues old characters. Personally I think the problems lies into EVE's character development from the beginning.
---
I think skills learning shouldnt be time based but ISK based, either with cheaper injectors or a system like ship's insurance. You would buy the skill books on the market like it is, then once the skill books injected you can just apply level 1 by injecting say 100 000 ISK into the book, then it would scale up for higher levels skills and books. This could create a nice ISK sink aswell to slow down inflation. Or just have smaller injectors like the alpha ones that some tutorials used to give you, but craftable by players. Attribute and implants could reduce the ISK needed aswell.
---
 These methods could make players feel like they're working for their skills rather than waiting, a bit like in other MMOs where you work up levels by killing mobs and doing quests, but here you could get lucky in your exploration run and get 100m worth of stuff in a wormhole and learn into a new ship without having a terrible grind unless you blast Veldspar all day. Players would take more risks to make more ISK faster and go run missions in low sec or NPC null. Go mine in lowsec or null, rat in lowsec or null, risks for money. You could even combine time with ISK so that you can still learn a bit if you're broke as hell lol.
---
 Learning the ropes in EVE isn't artificially waiting 25 days to fly a T2 kitey ship, it's learning the REAL skills associated with flying your ship, how to kite (keep range, ammo type, disruptor vs scramblers, using and killing drones, transversal, tracking, etc). Otherwise, even if you're a newbie you can inject into a shiney ship that you'll lose very quickly. Ive been playing EVE for years and if I were to inject into a Curse tomorrow I wouldnt be sure how to use it, which fits, which ships to attack, where and when to attack, etc.. And that's just one exemple of one aspect of the game, you still have to learn PI, research, industry, the market, jump clones, dscan, probes, all ship classes, modules, wormhole classes and their mechanics, etc.. There's just so much.
---
Lol, that would literally make what you're complaining about worse in every aspect.
---
I don't say that my goal is to have equal chance for all players, i say that CCP changed the mechanic having this goal ( initially those are meant to be faction locked).        
---
I say that it is not working - and propose a logical solution to make spans much more equally distributed.           
---
you sound like someone who have plans to change this fact. 
---
It did help a lot, but they managed to form fleets with as many logi as we could form in total during USTZ, they could've won against us if they had been able to fight us in our timezone.
---
Please enlighten me
---
Actually no, because every one can store a ships and clones and contest a sotiyo - or just kill players doing it if this is in NPC space.       
---
You cannot do that if this is in the middle of sov , 3 'sov mids' from nearest NPC station. 
---
Some things are better kept private so dig, read documentation about what you can pull from eve servers ... you will find it eventually. 
---
Thanks to everyone who showed up, and to the groups that formed up to fight (Salt Farmers &amp; BRAVE). We'll do another one of these soon.

If you call them peasants but you run away from them, what does that make you?

another perfect example rly 
---
&gt; I’ve been playing for about a year and a half
---
There is your problem.
---
[removed]
---
I don't have kills just locations where they are showing - so i cannot provide you with the info you ask. 
---
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY! 
---
Read what you posted earlier.

Where did you get that?

I'm coming up on my one year anniversary of playing EVE. I joined Pandemic Horde and went out on fleets to lowsec. Fell in love with Caracals and brawling. I helped kill the Triumvirate Keepstar and watched my allies defend the Keepstar in 9-4. I lost my first Raptor there because of an allied bombing run. I tried ratting in a VNI but I wanted more. I wanted to lead fleets. But I wasn't allowed.
---
So I left Horde and joined Goons and led dozens of fleets per month and even got to lead those big fleets you speak of. Now I'm doing something a little different. EVE is a wonderful game. So many opportunities should you choose to grab them.
---
Now I have a supercarrier. I killed my first Dread spawn today after losing more fighters than I care to admit.
---
It's been a great year. I love this game.
---
Yeah, if that'd be possible you couldn't allow people to scam others and all the fine stuff that is legally prohibited in RL but encouraged in Eve.   
---
Also there are trillionaires in this game who did most likely not make all their money  the honest way.  And this would be directly translatable to the real world. 1.5t ISK roughly translates to 20k dollars. 
---
&gt;it's happened what, 3-4 times now?
---
Caught*, how many times it happened is anyone's guess
---
When they were testing capitals on sisi people were ejecting from titans as soon as they fired their DD and going back and getting another rather than wait for the timer because there was an unlimited supply AoE effectively free ships. At the same time on tranq Titan pilots hid in their pos bubbles fearful of moving incase RocketX nuked their 100 billion asset. People suicide gank catalysts and tornados because they are cheap enough to be disposable, suicide your Titan for lolz in PL and expect terse words from rageliner for shitting up his kB. People’s risk appetite is connected to the value of the loss and the effort to acquire it, nobody cries over losing shuttles or noob ships yet people still kek over Titan kills - nobody wants to be that guy who loses a super, if you made them 100 isk nobody would care. This is how Eve has always been and why we have a culture of telling people they were dumb for flying blue mods in null/low, now isk is raining from every asteroid and anom the culture has changed and if you tell people they are dumb for losing a faction fit super they laugh at you for being a poor. The only reason to be a poor pvp’r now Is because you either consider yourself too elite to krab or have some perverse ideological stance that space guild x is the root of evil and being a rebellious Indy makes you a superior space being, when in reality it doesn’t matter whose team you play on and joining the evil empire to be showered with money to buy shiny ships you can afford to blow up might actually be more enjoyable than waiting in a station unable to fly anything you want to. I mean sure you can basque in the elite ness of your solo killboard, but it sucks to be a veteran with less ban roll than a 3 week old hordeling who recognised that grinding for currency is an inherent part of every mmo.

citadels in each system, which means safe tethers to warp to whenever someone comes in.

I have no idea what’s the point of your comment. If you have something constructive to say like “I’ve repeatedly seen this bug before” then just say it. I roam literally every day with a ceptor alt so while I can only speak for myself and people I play with I know what I’m talking about. I see that shit every day since it’s there.

Yes, we know, there are areas with issues. Ask for a megathread about it, hide it somewhere and get on with it.
---
The feature become redundant so the herd moves on.. does that mean complaints are down . Yes .. at the same no use of the feature means that no only arent the players investing in it, it then becomes a low point in future expansions around demand..
---
That doesn’t mean if self corrected or as per balanced design ccp were right.. all it demonstrates is how to moth ball feature in the game as a recipe 🧐
---
&gt; FW is fine, it was never really about system control for most people it was about a good way to get fights.

Fuck off, you have no idea what you're talking about.

Ah, it's a shame you get belittled for that. You might want to look into browser fingerprinting and how to avoid that (as, nominally, folks who don't use various services that data-collection-focused companies provide tend to leave a 'hole' in the data that can be threaded together, so to speak, as well, in order to determine the nature of their browsing habits -- one of the big ways to do that is via 'fingerprinting', though I'm admittedly not well-versed on it myself).

Is incursion running profitable?
---
I’m also not sure why you say that frostline was the same tech as crimson harvest because iirc crimson harvest was deadspace while frostline broke it. No deadspace + camera lock + fucking white screen made it complete cancer and now we are left with the worst bug for actual pvp combat since the massive rubberbanding episode of 1-2 years ago
---
Well they are ^^almost normal citadels after all ....
---
sadly true....citadels are easier to spam and replace than they are to destroy.
---
and fozziesov plus citadels makes controllign sov near worthless when fighting invaders (minus jump bridges and cyno inhibs)
---
at this point, the only way to win is to make the enemy act like GOTG, and quit.
---
to be fair, that was PL.  and those of us in Horde are also waiting on them to follow through with that, though none of us are expecting much

---
Tactical Supremacy is one of the larger AUTZ Alliances, with a great mix of Subcap and Capital pilots/fleets
---
For a new/returning player I highly reccomend Winnie Blues and VB Crew - we have players spread out from New Zealand to Perth, with a lot of fleets forming around 7:30pm your time, with more going on after DT (which is around 930pm your time).
---
The worst part is they did it AFTER introducing fatigue. Prior to fatigue, moons (R64s and Tech) were a massive source of passive income to a select few alliances. But fatigue localized this passive income because no one was building up their jump timers to save moons making them a few bil per month. Introducing fatigue nearly deleted the need for eliminating these sources of passive income because they could easily be fought over by smaller entities. 
---
Who is that? I've heard the name
---
Yes about 100-120 million an hour once you are actually in the fleet.

I like your video man, it's fun to see a little window into your journey to start to try to figure EVE out. 
---
One thing that might help, if you keep DScaning while the fight is going on, and another ship appears on your 1 AU Dscan, you can align out and attempt to bail on the fight. One of the nice things about FW space is that it takes time to warp to a beacon, activate, and then ultimately get inside the plex, which gives you some time to bail.

Then again why would anyone even jokingly flair as brave?

FYI you don't have to worry about wardecs if you join a corp with no structures.
---
I'm not too used to POS since I started playing when citadels were introduced and I mostly fought around citadels but  : 
---
- Citadels if fueled have one more timer, so it takes more time to kill them
---
- Citadels have cap damage, which means you cannot dump a big ass cap fleet on it to kill it quickly. It's sometimes time to kill (aren't gate or cyno jammer 30min of cap dps to reinforce ?)
---
- Tether is a relatively strong mechanic to stay on grid.
---
- Citadels have pretty strong guns, neuts, web, bombs and for Keepstar even DD, which makes it a big pain in the ass to have a fight on grid with it
---
I prefer the bumper sticker "Nuke the Whales" it gets the right reaction out of the right people.

Have you even fought on a grid of true dick star or jamm star with proper gunner alts?
---
The two big communities are warp to me or the valhalla project. Both will have their fits for you but you need either a battleship (preferably a faction one) or a t2 logi with logi V trained. 
---
You're talking a Keepstar or some kind of deathstar POS ?
---
Apart from the killmail whoring everyone else mentioned, I'm pretty sure it can be used to trigger drones if you're running some form of drone assist comp.

We're a shit tier TEST pet, but it's better than a CVA pet. Daddy TEST also doesn't yell at us too much, unless we steal faction forts n crap. All in all, we're a bunch of idiots that feed to war decs and have a good time.

😂 you should ponder that for a bit.

I’ve spent the last hour pondering it and can’t come up with anything.

The more charged the capacitor the biggest should be the explosion, makes sense.

Let's try to push this into development. 
---
Is this what dinobrains actually believe?
---
1st one is large pos with guns around it - if someone incap one you are onlining another while focusing fire from all guns on one target.      
---
2nd one is about jams ... a lot of them, enough to jamm all DPS and if not for sure all logistic and ewar ships.         
---
Whole point is that citadel damage is delayed, ewar can be applied to 1-3 ships at most but you want t to one.       
---
Well configured pos could easily kill dreads - same for subcapitals.    
---
Simply not so many towers where done this way.

Large Tower with Guns+Tackle+Neuts+Hardeners was called dickstar. Large tower with less guns, but a ton of Hardeners an Jammers was called Jamstar, jammers mostly were Amarr/Minma to harass the fotm Logis so the remaining guns could pop subs on grid ...
---
Please stop. Get some help
---
Sure, but for a solo player I think C2’s have higher risk, due to the statics and the popularity among pvpers primarily. 
---
Will version 2 include an alliance update?
---
Well alright, as I said I didn't fought around a lot of POS so didn't really know much about that. That being said, how many POS in the game where fitted that way compared to simple, let's just say forts ?
---
It was like that for a while, but once they made the changes to cits, they all got cleared out pretty quick.  It is somewhat rare to find LP cits in low class space now, and finding systems without any is pretty common

To be completely honest I haven't been around to have been here for the origin of most of these 'long lasting reasons', however I do feel people on Reddit are way more interested in just screaming about their 'snowflake' solution than engage in a normal conversation which you are asking for.
---
I think for many people who have started playing, myself included, Eve doesn't feel like it's dying. I throughly enjoy playing with the people in my corp/alliance/coalition and experiencing/improving in the things I enjoy doing in game.
---
Yes, some things CCP could improve on and maybe should have shown that over the years but I just refuse to believe in a world where CCP would actively not listen to their own costumers/players.
---
I do think the decision to close down the Community Team was a colossal mistake and that should be addressed as should some other issues we shouldn't let CCP forget about. But thinking that CCP could fix these as soon as we would like to see and in the way some people here on Reddit seem to think they should be fixed is unreasonable.
---
Oh my sweet summer child, wake up. There won't be any fixes in the future. CCP sold their soul to the Koreans and they already started to fire people and assigned teams to other projects. If you're lucky enough they won't make DED drops only accessible by a special key, that you have to buy for real money first.

Ah, Pax Sex. Salty of the salty.

---
There are certainly people I'd love to re-connect with. Swanger, DrSmashface, BavarianWitch &amp; Weasil to name but a few, Freindships sort of come and go which is sad when you've been playing for so long, EvE is so THICC, and groups so protective of coms, even if they last for a number of years, IRL breaks tend to transition to breaks between groups.

Lived in a C2 with C2/LS statics for a long time. There was a freeport low-power astra in it that I found during a long trip through WH space. I stayed there for a while and would day trip through the static and other connections for sites to hack. It worked well enough that I made a few alts and put them in the astra so that I could get back if I needed. 
---
One day I got had gotten a pretty big haul through to a good Jita connection and sitting on a bil decided to blow it all on a Raitaru and industry fittings. I hauled it back in a no-cloak Badger back to the hole and somehow made it safe to the astra.
---
The next day I waited for all the statics to turn over, then anchored it in the middle of off hours. Just as I was about to log on to babysit the timer coming out, one of the DDOS attacks that were going on happened and the server was down for a few hours. The rait called Bar None anchored in the meantime. 
---
I thanked Bob and moved my things over from the astra to my new home. 
---
It was pretty easy to get logistics for fuel and whatnot through the K-space static. Usually I'd come out not that far from a good hub and could scout my way through the LS or I'd get a favorable HS connection through my C2 static. There were a few times that I got ganked running sites or hauling stuff back in, but it was mostly when I was being lazy or not paying well enough attention. One time a Tengu slipped right past my scout and I didn't think anything of it until he shredded my Bestower full of fuel once I jumped it through the hole. I got to talking with the guy and he scooped the fuel that dropped and contracted it back to me at the k-space station. 
---
I lived like this for a good while, building up a stock of BPOs that I used to make shit fit PVP ships and the basic things I needed for WH life. I trained up in to a decent Astero fit and would trip through the static hunting for explorers. Or I'd jump through the LS static and tank my sec status. It was easy enough to finance the monthly expenses for the structure with PI income and the occasional good relic site. 
---
A few times, people came and plinked the shields to look for a response. I couldn't really give good fights but would sometimes mess around with them and chat it out. Tri came and blew up the low-power astra that had been my original home in the hole, and I killed off the POCOs to improve my margin on PI.
---
Eventually I left my home for a while to explore null and do some other things in the game, but I would keep the Rait fueled about a month at a time. I went on vacation for a while and didn't bother keeping it up, so it went low power. Just as I was thinking about going back to refuel it, I get a notification that Odin's Call has put it into structure. The timer was set to my old time zone, so it would be coming out at 5AM my time. 
---
I headed back to the hole (always having kept a few alts in so I could scan my way back) and copped a mega to roll the statics. It was my first time ever rolling the holes solo, as the whole time previously I would just take what Bob gave me. I evac'd everything of value, then rolled the wholes without issue,  thinking I managed to roll out a scanner in another connection as I finished. With fresh statics, I settled in to my chair around 4:30AM to wait out the reinforcement. I woke up the to see my Rait swarming with Odin's Call Drakes and support ships. I can only imagine they had logged off in the hole or had somehow kept a scanner to bring the fleet last minute.
---
There's was nothing I was going to do against that, so I gave them a GF in local and  packed up my last things into my alt ships before logging. RIP Bar None: [https://zkillboard.com/kill/73976048/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/73976048/)

It was a really good time and I made back way more than I put in at the end of the day, in both fun and ISK. WH life is not so bad once you get used to the ins and outs as long as you don't take yourself so seriously.

Yes, unfortunately for whatever reason the votes do not always go through even when you click the correct button. I find the whole corp management with shares/votes to be horribly broken and buggy at times. If you again complete the vote and select the correct option but the result says 0 votes you should submit a ticket to CCP.

Probably for the best for your overall health.

You know this isn't 2016 anymore?

Maybe all your dudes resub and you out form us, but that's not a given anymore.

We won't do it anyway.

Well to be fair, I only stayed 2 months in WH as a PVP attempt an had a 2nd WH for industry for a bit longer. 
---
I have my main and my 2ndary PVP alts in a C2 with a static C2 &amp; static low sec. The ides was I'd pirate low sec from the WH with new hunting grounds each day.. As luck would have it, my WH low sec static seemed to open up in the ass end of dead amarr/minmitar space..
---
Now my other WH was a C1 with a high sec static. It was very easy to maintain via the high sec static but those are hard to find or at least they were.
---
Something nice about him! Kappa
---
Can you say that though? State of the game when you started might have been the 'same' but you didn't have the sperg/salt mine that is Reddit sometimes. So a new player might view the game and all of it's quirks as great.
---
yup, huge unsustainable growth enabled by venture capitalists and anti-consumer-minded-consumers will crash the industry as fast as it has grown.
---
The state of the game is not the same as when I started, though. Not at all.

EVE community: Please finish structures in space changes 
---
CCP: We have a brand new feature for dumping isk and also for monetarisation called Loot Boxes payable in real money.
---
EVE community: please continue the ship rebalancing
---
CCP: Ever heard of Loot Boxes?
---
EVE community: please give us new content, also whats up with Jove space?
---
CCP: Loot Boxes it is!
---
EVE community: overhaul the sov-system
---
CCP: Loot Boxes are realy cool tho
---
EVE community: please fix the Rorq, its destroying the economy
---
CCP: LOOT BOXES!!!!
---
EVE community: WE DONT WANT FUCKING LOOT BOXES
---
CCP: whoa, now that you guys are talking about it we will actually bring twice as many and expensive Loot Boxes, its the thing that pur commmunity wants the most 
---
well then you are part of the problem
---
&gt; You're so dumb. https://i.imgur.com/m2351s3.png
---
Are you saying I'm dumb when you link a Google search result, that 1) is not organic and 2) is relative to your own search history. Second of all, the screenshot you provided clearly shows that the term "ganking" is to kill another eve player, while "suicide ganking" is to gank another eve player and expecting to die yourself - and how to keep that profitable.

what? who shit in your head? in no other game you could make proposal like that and make it sound sincere
---
I'm not too interesting so I'll keep it somewhat terse to save reading for others.
---
Please note I have been injecting SP heavily.
---
I have trained into multiple ships (up to Rorquals and carriers).
---
I have become a logi pilot and LA.
---
I am a skirmish commander (think trainee FC).
---
I am a booster/boosher.
---
I help with the onboarding of new members.
---
I have done some wormhole stuff and some exploration.
---
I have done some industry/import/export.
---
I have done and still do PI and moon mining.
---
I have done some, but not nearly enough solo/small gang stuff.
---
I have done some scouting.
---
I have done some home defense.
---
I have fought in a war, destroyed structures and entosised as both fleet member and FC (skirmish commander).
---
I have helped a member sneak a super carrier purchased on fire sale across the map and through hostile space to its new home.
---
I have moved a carrier for a friend when a move op was going on.
---
I have made friendships both in game and out of game.
---
I have learned many nice things that have improved my out of game life, cooking, music, alcohol (helloooooo Scotch!).
---
I have found fellow players that love both space exploration and history.  Many books are now on my shelves because of this.
---
But most importantly, I have had fun.
---
In all I'd say, I am home, and am glad I made it out here.
---
lol this so much
---
GIRL = Guy In Real Life
---
"Yes, some things CCP could improve on and maybe should have shown that over the years but I just refuse to believe in a world where CCP would actively not listen to their own costumers/players."
---
You should have been around for first to lock wins when it was geddons with tachyons and all heatsinks in the lows as there was no stacking penalty and no tracking, when vexors ran around with 10-15 ogres II's, when mines lagged out the system and all the connecting systems, yulai event to move a tradehub, nos and nano cancer (which was really fun I must admit), carriers and dreads being pretty much what supers and titans are now, REMOTE Titan doomsday that were gridwide! game grids being small and extremely broken. 
---
Can go on to really recent things like the t3 cruiser and destroyers, both broken before released but both still released and then nerf and nerfed and nerfed again, granted they done the destroyer nerf in a shorter timeframe than the cruisers but still, took far longer than it should have. Then we come on to the rorq changes....never more has this topic been pretty much agreed upon by the entireplayer base that once CCP put the changes on the test server we screamed in unison that it was broken. i remember at the time alot of "eve celebs" wrote a fair few articles about it at the time of how rediculously OP they were and we pretty much all agreed, Hell, they even had discussions with CCP on and CCP ignored pretty much everyone and done it anyay, a few nerfs later we have the current ones.
---
Also never not forget the Injector mess we have! Something that fucks with core game and the way CCP did it is a crime!
---
Throw skins for $$$ is fine as it doesn't mess with core game but they done it for nothing but greed (greed is good remember? google eve online greed is good if you need a reference)
---
Move on the the latest one and it's chat, has been broken since day 1, 1 week later still broken, 1 month still broken. At that point ccp should have pretty much rolled it back as it is/was clearly a failure but ccp do ccp things and plow on regardless. 10 months later they admit it's a disaster and no fix is in sight but it took 10 MONTHS, 10 MONTHS!!!!!!! 
---
It's a pattern they keep repeating and every now and again throwing the playerbase some free sp and shineys to pacify the masses for a little bit but it's not enough. Nearly all the core playerbase would love for them to shelf new content in favour of fixing core gameplay that has been around for years now but they have this need to keep throwing out shiney stuff, breaking more things and then after the flames can't be controlled they try and fix it and end up fucking up worse than before so throw out a little more free sp and shit to pacify folks....rinse and repeat as 15yrs prove.
---
NEVER FORGET BOOT.INI
---
"Is CCP truly that shitty?"
---
Yes, it is, the amount of times the community has to raise it pitch forks in "summer of rage", "Monocle gate". The number of failures of all of its secondary attempts to make games. The inability to integrate simple chat systems into the game without them breaking everything. The multitude of constant game breaking bugs, (like the one above). Simple limitations of the game that should have been lifted and fix ages ago eg: 500 item hanger limits, contracts fucking up constantly, FAX meta when rep carriers actually required skill, them banning players without appeal, them NOT banning known bots, and being unable to detect the massive bot rental empires (Their confession, and outright LIE, they allow bots to go unnoticed for years). Jita undock instant lockers, trading bots, autopilot bots, while banning multi boxers, and multiboxing tools. The list can go on friend. CCP is Bethesda, they make a shitty game with bugs, lots of bugs. CCP is Ubisoft, they make tons of crappy games no one plays, just one or two good ones. And finally CCP became EA when they got bought by Pearl. 
---
I'm still waiting for the shoe to drop, when CCP can't raise their profit by the end of this year (Q3 or Q4), the next phase of the PA takeover begins.
---
Why I think that, is because when CCP was bought:
---
"The $425 million includes both cash and a bonus earnout **if certain financial targets are met.**"
---
They aren't going to tell us what happens when those financial targets aren't met. Those failures are coming. Hilmar is like your drunk uncle whom takes all your lunch money for liquor.
---
"Hilmar told Hollywood industry paper [**Variety**](https://variety.com/2018/gaming/news/ccp-games-pearl-abyss-sale-eve-online-1202936322/) that the infusion of cash will allow the studio to improve the game and possibly pursue partners for **a film deal.**"

---
I count 5 possible new and upcoming failures to squander the 425 million dollars CCP received. Money that isn't going back into the game to ensure its continued success, re-visioning, and remastering.
---
I could write you a book with tons details for everything that makes CCP bad. But that's a lot of effort for something so obvious. As for those other games? GTA is a mixed bag of players, I login sometimes but the more I do the more I notice its full of Russians and Chinese. Which nothing against them, but it makes for a no communication boring game sessions, and my computer doesn't render the Chinese properly anyway. Most players just shoot on sight. Which makes the excitement of GTA, not the players but the game play to be honest. The core of GTA's game play being a casual shooter game, with fun modes and missions, oh and a side of racing, planes and boats. Who actually plays Elite Dangerous, and Fallout 76? Its a mystery. Sorry if you do.
---
Which is why I used 'same'. My point is that you were able to grow into the game and all it's flaws without the sperg and shitting on Eve/CCP of Reddit. And that might have made your experience better, so why not allow the new players of now that privilege? By calling CCP out on the important things but also realise you are still talking to people so do it in a way you might respond to constructively. Some people mentioned that CCP employees used to visit this subreddit a lot more in the past and given the language I've seen some people use against the devs and CCP I can't actually blame them that this frequency has gone down.   
---
was a dictor bubble always anti-tethering? if no, this will be a great shift in citadel fights as the defenders can retreat much less easily
---
Rorqs, a few years ago, were utterly useless. The only thing they were useful for was mining boosts, but because offgrid boosts were a thing, you just sat one in a pos.
---
Now they are the best mining ship in the game, have more local tank than any other ship in the game, have a 7 minute invulnerability button, and are scale very VERY well.
---
Damn, then some guys I know would make literally $5m USD
---
thats all?

&gt;"Fixes have been made to make New Eden a safer place."
---
First of all, WTH
---
Second of all, I thought it wasn't supposed to be safe
---
But as you mentioned (some) of those issues don't exist anymore because they were addressed by CCP and changed. Sure, they might not get it right first time and some issues might hang around longer than some people would feel is OK but you literally pointed out (some) issues that were addressed by CCP to improve our game experience
---
&gt;The game devs at the time would change things two to three times a day just to see what would and would not work and the affects it had and then discuss it with the testers.
---
That's how software development usually goes. You are a lot more flexible in the starting phase of the project as you prioritize core functionality changes and tweaks over bug fixing, stability and general quality control. This is a state where both developers and the users are usually happy as developers get to be flexible and change things when problems arrive and the users see new shiny features they ask for being implemented on a daily basis and ignore bugs that don't break core functionality. This is phase is amazing and this is why so many games stay in "early access/beta" for years. But no matter how hard you try this phase starts fading, the software project begins accumulating years of minor bugs and eventually also technical debt as new tech is introduced that does not function as well with the old. You also get issues with whenever you start making changes to something it effects old code in a bad way. At this point you just have to introduce quality control of the product and more... The project just naturally becomes more rigid....
---
And that is all just from a technical standpoint. If you look at it from a company standpoint it gets even massier... bigger teams need more coordination and management, etc... 
---
On the other hand... Wouldn't null be kind of dull if everywhere was the same? Even _more_ dull, even. I kind of don't like the idea of, say, a set of hexes that are all strategically equivalent, and folks effectively just picking whatever has the lowest level of activity if they need to move for whatever reason.
---
I searched through a proxy and got almost the exact same results. All of them being highsec ganking for 5 pages minimum and I'm going to guess if you search in google yourself you will too.
---
&gt; But to be fair, the results shown there that may not explicitly call for suicide ganking 
---
You could have just said that's not what you meant. The reality is that most people would correlate ganking with highsec suicide ganking.

Thank you

Agreed but this becomes 100000% worse when people can anonymously be dicks on the internet.

Pro tip, buy Plex, sell it and buy the multiple pilot training certificate at jita. 
---
Only if you change your Location/Desktop often. When you entered the Code once, you can exempt your current machine from further auths. If a hacker gets remoteor physical access to your system an eve-account is the least thing to worry about.
---
Thanks for nothing! 
---
I don't recall the exact mission name but I had done a drone Level 4 recently that had 5 battleships in one pocket, each one dropping Elite Drone AI that sold for just over 5mil each so 25mil total just in that loot and it was a fairly short mission. So some are pretty lucrative even without huge bounties.

Well, we´re getting "a lot" of bugfixes with this release compared to the months before. I would like to think that this is a good sign but looking at the fixes it really seems like most of it is cosmetical stuff, spelling mistakes and once again dumbing down and making a few things safer than before like with this
---
&gt; Duel Invite dialog no longer opens with exclusive focus, and there is now a Confirmation dialog step to properly accepting a duel.
---
*sigh*
---
lol, oof
---
You know, videos like these aren't helping when your FCs and stuff screech "hurr we're neutral"...  
---
Thanks for posting though, it seems I need to offer some people some loans. 
---
It might not bother you much but I would guess if stuff is genuinely broken (chat) you would try to fix that.
---
Even if that doesn't lead to immediate solution, you keep trying to fix that. I'm honestly astounded that people think CCP would just do nothing with the fact a part of their game is broken but that the fix might be infinitely more complex than they can see/comprehend.
---
Progod is one of the best FCs in the game. Period.
---
Wow, thats shitty loot
---
everyone's definitely interested!
---
great infographic! please make one for hybrids/lasers &lt;3
---
I had the issue as even did a support ticket and they said “it’s broken we can’t fix it quit the Corp
---
And make a new one” 
---
I agree that some of it is done to improve our gameplay experience but when you keep fucking it up more than even come close to fixing stuff and keep trying to fleece an ever declining player count then you have to stop and think.
---
two words, LEGACY CODES!

Nah, CBB went back to Provi when we joined Legacy. Haven't heard from him in a bit, but he's probably busy with that game called "real life".
---
Row Row Fight the Power in TEST are some pretty cool dudes 
---
This comment section is exactly what I was talking about. 
---
Properly operating structures 
---
Yup I agree with you on what it is and why it went the way it did but when your game has a social core the way has, then little to no interaction with them affects things greatly and CCP has been getting worse over the years. They fired the community team for gods sake! granted it wasn't very good but at the same token, it was better than we have now.
---
I want to know more!
---
I’m happy about all the bug fixes. It’s good to see an update where problems are being resolved. I hope that CCP continues to include bug fixes of this scope on future updates. That said, RIP my Yellowjacket investment. 
---
Oh no a grown ass man who cares about video game leadership thinks I made a fool of myself what will I ever do 
---
Honestly, in all the ways it matters, EvE is better than when I started back in 2008. There's tons more content, PvP isn't just nanofags for days, titans can die, and nullsec regularly sees the kind of content that once was relegated to only the biggest mass battles. Exploration can be done by people who aren't obsessive nutjobs like myself. Fleet meta isn't "get a capital or die to one doomsday." CCP Engages with the community now more than they did then.   
---
Pretty much the game is objectively and subjectively better now than it was then... but I'll still always look back on those days more fondly because that was my first sense of wondrous, anxious, exploration into this crazy world of internet space ships.
---
highsec pvp is clearly the true endgame 
---
We are just getting started.
---
I'm in Pandemic Horde.
---
TEST I hate you and I'm ready to spend my whole net worth fighting you and defending our space until the last battle venture I own.
---
But Eve is just a game after all so I hope you will have an amazing week end, spend time with your friends/family, play Eve a lot, get a good dinner. &lt;3
---
Fly safe o7
---
"Fixes have been made to make New Eden a safer place."
---
What does this mean?
---
Fundamentally I agree with you. 
---
I already acknowledged that all ideas void of logic, reason, and sensible benefit to the game are taken for what they are and don't even enter the implementation/consideration process.
---
That being said I never said OP had good ideas or CCP should implement what he's saying. I just made the point that comparing CCP to Walmart is overly dramatic and disingenuous to the conversation we are trying to have. But you absolutely have to push it because it helps your narrative so by default I'm wrong and I don't comprehend how large business works(even though CCP isn't one and doesn't operate even remotely similar) 
---
please read again
---
Nice!
---
Yep.  All you really need to do is balance risk vs. reward.  I ran the drake for awhile and went ahead and bumped up to a sacrilege.  Sites went faster, exposed less longer..     
---
I moved into a C2 Wolf Rayet (small weapons bonus).  Was perfectly capable of running combat sites in a Hawk....
---
 "Fixed an issue where wormholes would sometimes not correctly expire  over downtime. This could lead to static wormhole's reappearing at the  same location as the previous one, or wormholes that lead to different  locations in different directions."
---
Thank you CCP :) 
---
There's a difference between making things "safer" and changing things that are just giving people a bad game experience for no good reason.
---
For instance, this was causing a lot of issues for rookies, and has been heavily used by people who just want to grief the shit out of other players who're still learning the game.
---
I'm all for EVE being harsh, rough and dangerous, but not everything has to be implemented in a way where you can fuck with someone unexpectedly and ruin their experience.
---
If we see something that's fundementally causing problems like this, then it'll be changed for the better. This isn't a new concept, it's been happening since 2003.
---
&gt; Gameplay:
---
Fixed kill reports not generating when ships are destroyed by sentry guns.
---
This is useful AF, as I have a good general idea of what charge is what, but am always checking the stats because I confuse them
---
Typically we use this line when we've fixed an exploit and don't want to reveal the particulars.
---
Caimans are dope. 
---
These are super cool &lt;3 
---
They required breaking tether to launch but i think if you warped you could tether after you warped, even if your bubble was still around, so this is a nerf to interdictor survivability, yea.
---
What about c3 and c4? How much dps should you be tanking with say a drake 
---
I feel the pain of ass end of nowhere LS statics, but have find those system generally have some nice WH, null, and ls connections themselves.  
---
probably just looks at zkill for locations, nothing complicated.
---
Much love.
---
Thanks for all your hard work falcon - improving gameplay for turbo newbros is something everyone here can get behind &lt;3
---
This is seriously useful 
---
similar for smartbombs pls
---
He's an FC for TEST
---
Theres a video of it somewhere
---
First thing of the patch note is the best ^^
---
Seeing some changes to combat anom to improve performances, could a look be given at (level 4) mining missions anoms ? they have a ton of clouds stacked and mixed between each other, making my computer going up in temperatures noticably (with high settings).
---
I think I'm the only person here who did understand any of this. Like i don't get it. What is everyone laughing at exactly? 
---
For the untrained eye, i only saw an Amazon alexa video with some guy jist saying random unrelated stuff? There must be references im not recognizing or something.
---
Tons of ore? Don’t we deal in m3? I would have to identify that as the error...
---
sadly, alot of them dont know of Empires of EVE T.T
---
Ratting does not work for me and I don't like exploring too much
---
There are. :) tis progod
---
For me, personally, none of these changes have made the game worse and MOST of them have made the game better. 
---
And my original statement still stands: The game isn't ruined, despite what others said. It's still great. 
---
Perkone
---
Who is progod?
---
Any BR? You guys only managed to get the Apostle?
---
Was it causing the issues or was it their lack of paying attention to things that was causing the issues?
---
&gt; By calling CCP out on the important things but also realise you are still talking to people so do it in a way you might respond to constructively
---
I'm getting really tired of people like you. You seem to not want to realize that it doesn't matter what tone is used, CCP response is either absent or very slow. Issues that have been around for years don't suddenly get fixed if we just ask CCP nicely. 
---
Not being able to read and/or comprehend the difference between "Accept" and "Decline" (or waiting what happens once the strange countdown from 30 downwards is complete) in a pop up window that states "duel request" (or w/e, long time since i saw one) is imo a pretty good reason to punish someone.
---
It has two mining lasers thus it has no cyno.
---
I wish iwantisk didn't have to try to make money off this...   I made over 200 bil isk there before I even made my first bil in game...
---
Pretty minor compared to CCP actually releasing destroyers and especially attack BCs :D I do feel ganking has gotten silly when JFs or freighters get ganked just "because" though. At that point you might as well not undock/play. (and not during burn jita). There is for freighters certainly, zero counterplay beyond "don't undock" though. Jfs maybe get a chance to jump out if they have an exit cyno prepped but even then it is unlikely as they would have to get the jump off in the tick before they start getting disrupted. 
---
Hey Falcon, unrelated question but, is there an organisational chart available from CCP? Don't want any names, just out of interest
---
Unless you plan on mining in a venture then it most definitely isn't free. 
---
Player Owned Structure
---
There's rather a large difference for a new player between "lack of paying attention" and "paying attention, but have no idea what this means or how it varies from normal game play".
---
You are missing the point about goal of the change.        
---
Initially stuff was region locked and was meant to be region locked.     
---
Then change was made to every one could run it. 
---
The game is still great, no doubt, but sometimes it just takes up too much of your time.
---
The truth comes out.... StainGuy=CODE. 
---
Low Sec Gate to Stain=CODE.'s next big strategic move....
---
For shame.
---
POS
---
-no Dmg Cap, so dreads do full dmg and thus encourages dropping them to deal with POS fast
---
-no tether, so enemies have to leave the forcefield to lock you, instead of locking while safely tethered(until lock is finished)
---
-only 1 reinforcement timer with max of 36 hours. so fast to deal with
---
-offensive weapons are outside the pos, so can be targeted individually.
---
-FAX, rep the shields, encourages tug of war
---
-limited storage, cant fit 600 people in a POS, much less that many replacement ships, each ship hangar is limited
---
-if it dies, everything dies. no asset saftey.
---
citadels
---
-on deploy, free 3 days of fuel!
---
-while fueled, have 2 reinforcement timers
---
-2nd reinforcement timer can be DAYS long. up to a week
---
-even with no fuel, this 2nd reinforcement timer applies
---
-dmg cap means no fast kills, or high alpha. so subcaps ideal and artificially inflate the time to kill each level
---
-tether lets you deploy fleets of carriers.  safely sitting read to lock anything that comes.  can't lock them till they FINISH locking you.
---
-unlimited storage
---
-asset saftey
---
-built in weapons so no disarming citadel
---
in short, a POS encourages large ships to fight it, and isn't as spammable as they not as hard to kill undefended when attacked by large fleets
---
citadels encourage slow, artificially long tiems to kill each layer,  LONG reinforcement timers, usign subcaps that people ignore,  and can be spammed faster than they destroyed.   plus if your losing, just dock, and log off.  all your assets are safe!
---
I killed a brutix with a ruppy and gate guns and the kill never generated anywhere, this made me a very sad boi so im glad to see its fixed now at least.
---
Yeah, firing the community team effected me a lot. I was supposed to participate in a smaller EVE tournament, but they had to shut down the tournament server.. Also EVEsterdam, witch I went too was effected. Still don't get how you can fire someone as dedicated as CCP Leelo.. Oh well
---
Any plans for missiles and drones?
---
well, seems like I missunderstood. the bubble is now a "red timer" for docking. 
---
they just should add it to gates as well, and it's perfect
---
Check r/EveJobs
---
Actually CODE. is mostly PL guys now.     
---
If you don't believe me check yourself. 
---
No fix for the warp in bug, I thought that one would be high priority.
---
seriously?
---
So..  You're saying that it's too hard to understand what "XXX has sent a Duel request" Accept/Decline?
---
Much appreciated, these are very handy.

&gt;Changed "Ship Ambiance" to "Ship Ambience" in the Audio Menu Settings.

Its leviosa not levioSAAAAAA
---
Even more motivation to make my dps graph tool &gt;.&lt;

EvE is no longer a PVP game, it is mining online now.          
---
Get over it.

hey i like your editing and its a good video. However when only piloting a single bomber pls try to atleast put the camera in a place where something interesting happens. would defineatly make for a better video

Shit game, shit community, shit post

FALCON REPLIES TO MY COMMENT *swoons*
---
The last CH had a blackout at warp in and a change in nebula. It was said this was an extension of the abyss tech and was later expanded to Permafrost.
---
If TEST invited all their allies to that fight, it probably would have been blueballs too. It turns out, if you want decent content, you can't invite half the universe and expect the enemy to show up.
---
Not true. One m³ of water weighs 1000kg in the real world, for example. One unit of spod is 1e+35 kg and its volume is 16m³. If you want, you can easily calculate how many tons of spod you've mined.
---
I mean, a few years ago I posted on here about a hacker who was flying around at like 30km/s and unlockable, had a whole spectre fleet (or maybe bombers bar) see it, as well as having video proof. CCP didnt ban him and hes still playing to this day.
---
I gave up all hope in CCP actually banning people that day
---
Why do you want tracking and range for missiles? :thinking:
---
**Blasphemy !**

&gt;Sansha's Nation attempted to expand its borders into the the Serpentis Drug Outlet deadspace complex, but the Guardian Angels caught them and put a stop to it. The errant Sansha NPCs in the Serpentis Drug Outlet have been replaced by the correct Serpentis NPCs.                
---
Upvoted for quality shit. *Claps, stands up and keeps clapping*
---
Selling the fort was my only option at that point. The alliance I had deployed the fort for kicked me out because of it, and when the sister alliance booted me, within min of doing so, began batphoning anyone they could to attack it. That night it was reinforced by the sister alliance.   
---
So, in the end, I was left with making a last stand and watching it burn, as I was a neut to the area, or trying to sell it for next to nothing to the people trying to destroy it. Then funny enough, a neut was at one of the timers hoping to kill some people that came to attack it, we got talking, and his alliance offered me full value for it. 
---
My original intent for dropping the fort was to help the alliance as we didn't have access to one within 3 constellations. But when the people you flew with for 2 years turn on you and start attacking you (literally), why keep trying to help them?
---
not even reffed.  for the record yall should start reffing more nodes, I can't be the only one who does it
---
"Sansha's Nation attempted to expand its borders into the the Serpentis Drug Outlet deadspace complex, but the Guardian Angels caught them and put a stop to it. The errant Sansha NPCs in the Serpentis Drug Outlet have been replaced by the correct Serpentis NPCs."

Heh
---
The thing about it was you could be typing a sentence in a chat box, duel invite comes up as you hit enter to send the message, and get auto-entered into duel.
---
Just like how microsoft changed some of their auto-update shit so that you didn't accidentally shut down your computer for updates while typing out an email and hitting enter.
---
you just see a lot of bombers bar people screeching hurr we're neutral because marshy forgot to turn off his input broadcasting when posting on reddit as well
---
What? You recently batphoned goons that were supposedly a "third party" in this "invasion" of yours... I can mention so many fights where you were NOT outnumbered...
---
Why don't you yell us how you reeeeaally feel?
---
The whole thing sounds a bit stupid yeah but it sounds like you didn't plan it at all. Did you talk to your alliance CEO/leadership before dropping it? Maybe they didn't want one for a reason? Maybe they had intel about someone planning something? Maybe they were a smaller group and had an agreement with a bigger group nearby?
---
Where/when was this anyway? I find it hard to believe there's anywhere in the game without a Fortizar within 3 constellation at this point.
---
Its probably true. Although we don't know the density of the ore to confirm.
---
I don't think making every single dictor run a suicide mission is really a good idea.
---
A game system as complex as EVE and as dependent on complex interactions and efforts of tens of thousands of heavily invested nerds to imbalance it to their personal favor simply cannot be perfectly balanced 100% of the time. Life gets easier once you accept that fact and enjoy the game. 
---
I see what you did there 
---
Most of these comments are neutral or positive though?
---
Unfortunately, CCP lawyers would disagree, see Sons of New Eden and other spinoffs that got taken down.  They used to be OK with these things (aware and uncaring) but they've started cracking down on fanmade projects because :reasons:
---
As someone who still has to double check stats on ammo, this is crazy useful, thank you!
---
I’d buy it in a flash!
---
Mac support?
---
&gt;&gt;Fixed an issue where wormholes would sometimes not correctly expire over downtime. This could lead to static wormhole's reappearing at the same location as the previous one, or wormholes that lead to different locations in different directions.     
---
     
---
I knew I wasn't fucking crazy.
---
One of my goals was to create a dst alt and buy a hauler. Done that. Now I would like to make the money back in 2019 with saved hauling money. From my calculation, the investment needs 100 runs from the market to the factory and back. I've got 20 so far, so on a good way.
---
Additionally, I'd like to build some high value products for profit. T2 modules are good, but I have made some substantial money with it and would like to scale up. Not sure what to look for yet. T2 ships seem to not make more procentual profit, or if they do, there is not much demand. We'll see what I can come up with. 
---
Where can I send Isk?
---
1. Quit my corp
---
2. Find a better corp
---
3. Remember what fun is in the game

Rip all super pilots who bought yellowjacket for their pod

yup

and drones too

Rowan Crendraven is a boss.

Majority of teleported bots are from your alliance,doesnt it tell u smth? And yes other nullblobs have bots too. Delve is best place to bot,rmt right now.

1.[Probability and Odds are two different things](https://learn.problemgambling.ca/probability-odds-random-chance)

2. He didn't say every player should have an equal chance. He's discussing geographical location of Sotiyo spawns and the probability of them occurring equally in each region(which is easy to see with the neat little graph he made.)

I think he's trying to advocate that they shouldn't spawn in Sov null at all so that no one has an inherent advantage.

We are outnumbered in every fight... BUT we are here by choice.

I know it's "less secure" but authy is an alternative to google authentication that backs up the state (in its own service, but still).

You can take a C3 (probably not the relic's) in a drake but it would take forever.  Looking at a passive Myrmidon or Ishtar.  Rattlesnake maybe.    Honestly, the C2 will work out for you but if you get a C3, you will thank yourself later.  Maybe work the C2 until you find a C3?    
---
The C4 is kind of "meh".     
---
On a single account, you can run the sites in a passive rattlesnake, no problems but honestly, isk per hour a C3 is probably the same, maybe better.    
---
A C3 will only have a single static, LS, HS or Null so there is not a lot going on for statics.  Better pay in the hole, fewer options.  Either the C2 or C3 is a win.  A c4 is going to be a lot to maintain on your own.

This is like the bible for running wormholes.  Can work out the risk/reward.  
---
I fly the omen like the Navy issue, you just need to stay around 20-30km with scorch. Also no defensive neut.
---
That'd be a start. Also, if you're not flair baiting, leaving CODE also helps.
---
It's a fantastic anti caracal/bellicose/ONI/SFI if you fit a reactive armor harderner
---
What your showing here, isn't what you set out.
---
Let's ignore that the plural of anecdote isn't data, you seem to be of the mistaken impression that people have unlimited time, if I have 25 hours a week for eve I might Spend 1/2 hours generating isk at best and 22 of those getting into fights, not because I'm some PVP god not because I believe I'm elite but because that's like the part of the game that's fun. ( and yes the longer I do the less the grind becomes because you tend to learn not to die or well die less ).
---
My notion is that people that grind a lot of isk tend to have limited time to play eve as well and given they spent 20 hours grinding for isk tend to well not fight all that much unless there really time rich, because there limit game time is eating up by generating isk, rather than doing the parts of eve that are fun, now this is confirmed let's look at kills per toon
---
Goonswarm Federation 34,730 member total kills this month 6,470 that means: 0.18 kills per member, or in other words about 1 in 5 toons in GSF get's a killmail 
---
Now yes GSF in times of war is perfectly able to defend their space but let's stop pretending it's a bastion of PVP content when the majority of your members didn't get onto a killmail this month. 
---
Now compare that to NC. 3,790 members 4,084 killmails.
---
It seems rather obvious to me that a majority of people in GSF don't like to PVP and will only do so if they have to aka my notion that the vast majority of people that like to mine and rat don't go out to pvp is kinda supported by this data. 
---
No point in killing it if you aren't sure you can secure the loot.
---
So you're saying you know people with 375 trillion isk?
---
It's more around 300-360 an hour but if you're lucky enough to get faction titan spawns, you can quite easily hit 480m in a single tick. But that's reliant upon luck and is not considered to be consistent.
---
Progod has a nice voice. I wonder if he could become a singer. No shittalking here.
---
ISK is secondary to pushing your game on other people. 
---
Hey mate I just checked this as I knew that the issue had been fixed internally. Its just a case of the patch note being missed, it will be added soon.

Exactly my feeling when we finally worked out what the problem was, props to Habakuk for this fix!
---
Goals for 2019: Rekindle my love of EVE (which kind of went stale for most of 2018).
---
The last 2 weeks have been a pretty good start, and last night's brawl had me pretty hyped  :) 
---
Thank you! 
---
I was personally surprised by the similarities between the energy crystals and hybrid charges. 
---
Clearly we need more choices for Disintegrators though - look how empty that chart looks!
---
What were you saying about them? 
---
Welcome to the game! So good to have you be part of the EvE community. Let's blow some ships up!!
---
You are very welcome! Sorry it took us so long to track that fucker down!
---
You can't play free with the ship shown.
---
&gt; I just refuse to believe in a world where CCP would actively not listen to their own costumers/players.
---
I mean, you live in that world.  Whether you want to believe in it or not is entirely up to you, but just take a look at the game you play. Rorquals have literally been overpowered and far too scalable for the entire time you've played this game.  The afk VNI has been the number 1 ratting ship the entire time you've played the game.  Hell, the chat has been broken for **most** of the time you've played.  You saw people who were allowed to train for free on dozens or hundreds of accounts without paying a sub, and if you've paid attention, you've seen countless players buy years worth of SP in mere months.
---
PLAY FREE - Not in a mining barge laddie
---
I actually took a break from reddit for the last couple months and only popped in to do basic day to day stuff (Clearing spam queue). 
---
This thread was hit by automod and then pulled out of that spam queue by Zelden. In fact most of the 'removals' are just automod killing a thread for a number of reasons. Auto spam filtering is "Yes / no" - it doesn't 'think'. We can't really give it a bunch of options and tell it to remove based on multiple criteria. Instead its "If this word is used, remove". It's a constant thing to tweak automod to get the ratio of misfires a little better but given how basic the tool is there's just no way to get it even close to an acceptable error rate. Right now I'd argue around 15% of its removals are misfires and that's actually a fairly good rate for automod - unfortunately it's utter dogshit in reality.
---
No, see this; https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/aewbbj/-/edtf220

" Blue is definitely better  "
---
Fakenews
---
That was an awesome read. Can you explain this part to me:
---
&gt; (always having kept a few alts in so I could scan my way back)
---
Is it basically have alpha clones that can scan living in the wormhole so that you can scan how to get back into the hole at any time?
---
The PL Jackdaws were volleying your Kirins in your subcap fleet, allowing my Ishtars and the NC Apocs to chew through Eagles. They also brought a large contingent of titans/supers/caps, including a Molok, which you tackled when everyone warped off and proceeded to do nothing about it.  
---
Killboard very green yes
---
Good shit m8,
---
That’s how you learn to pvp and we all have been there done that.
---
Just tag along with me when you see me online(I am in your Corp) and we will go out and get some good ganks.
---
Cheers
---
Really cool, thank you.
---
As an idea: While tracking seems to be a useful metric on the y-axis for projectile-guns, it feels like it doesn't fit other weapon-types as well. I'd love to see slightly adjusted ones, that e.g. use energy-consumption instead of tracking on the y-axis to better express the differences of the energy-ammo.
---
Trying to think how to keep this short...
---
So to start, the alliance was small, like maybe 20 active people (don't know total numbers but less than 200). It was run as a dictatorship, but we weren't allowed to say that. For about a year, "leadership" kept stating we needed a fort as we'd been using Comms Black's and Unspoken's. Well, for whatever reason, half the alliance lost access to those structures with a line or rumors to why about 6 months before I dropped one. So for 3 months prior to me dropping a fort, I said I was going to, said where I wanted it, and was told not to as they wanted to build one rather than buy it; the same story it had been for a year. 
---
At the time, I was a one-man corp. I had just unanchored my last station, and because the two station owners in the alliance and I argued a lot, I had just lost my station access for the third time (they claim by accident).
---
So I decided to drop a Raitaru so I had a home, next door to the main alliance system. Got chewed out because I didn't get the king's permission to do so. Week later, I dropped the fort in the same system (that I paid for out of my pocket). I was then given a 7-day eviction notice almost immediately. Well, other parts of the alliance felt this was wrong and we kinda through a coup...that was successful...so that I didn't have to get evicted. The same day it flipped back too, which is then how the sister alliance took me in, as everyone except the king wanted that fort.   
---
Month later, I still had no access to any comms, any alliance information, and I'm about 5 men in my corp now (nothing to brag about but not one-man anymore). I get on one day, and my corp is being insulted by the sister alliance leader in alliance chat for not being informed and thus not part of the projects. I defend us, leaving with a non-eve personal jab at the alliance leader as I had to go to work. As I'm at work, I'm getting messages from my second of how we've been kicked (again) and that we're being attacked by my old alliance and new, and how Unspoken was batphoned to drop supers on it.
---
Two days later, guy from DUSK was camping the system waiting to attack the people that were attacking us. We got talking in local, and within I think 3 days, I sold the fort for full value. Week Later Coastal moved in next door to the fort and from what I'm told, haven't been making friends with my old alliances.
---
To go any further in detail, I'd have to write a book as there was a series of events that took place over almost a year. Sorry it wasn't as short as I wanted it to be.
---
Alliance: [Rising Dominion](https://evewho.com/alli/Rising+Dominion)

Sister: [Semper Fidelia](https://evewho.com/alli/Semper+Fidelia+Ut+STAIN)
---
Sweetie you should maybe be asking Kendarr why he ran all the way back to FDZ after losing a few logis, and then never undocking that evil SV dreadbomb in FDZ when the cap brawl started.  
---
Also fun fact, Horde/Panfam plays this game to PvP, not role-play a retarded empire building narrative. 
---
&gt;It is now no longer possible to re-dock at an Upwell structure in high sec while having a criminal timer and flying any ship (except a capsule). This is now behaving the same way as for stations.
---
Does this impact those freighter gankers? 
---
&gt;Fixed kill reports not generating when ships are destroyed by sentry guns.
---
Oh is this why so many of my Jita killmails never show up? I never knew that was a thing. 
---
thank god
---
- 10m ISK permit
---
- fit max tank
---
- limit your value
---
ie. Follow the Code.
---
Not the same thing, ghost training was fixed (maybe not in the timeframe desired but fixed). Chat I've already mentioned is bad but I don't think they haven't been doing anything about it, maybe not as visible or as wel communicated but working on it nonetheless.
---
Rest is different, those are issues in your eyes but are a playstyle for others. CCP not acting on something doesn't mean they didn't listen, it might just mean they didn't agree. Could they communicate this better? Sure. But I'm guessing the shear amount of input they get might preclude them from answering everything.
---
James 315 thinks im cool :(
---
Haha, the editing is really funny, good job.
---
That being said, could you turn off the option that asks google to automatically translate the title and descriptions of your video(s), please? The result is not very good, especially with all those special eve-related terms mixed in. (:

Absolutely brilliant, suicide ganking in an exploration ship is always a highlight.

The weapons system doesn't really lend itself well to switching ammo types on the fly, though so I doubt there'll be much to add there

Tonnes of ore
---
its a problem when you don't know first of all what windows has the focus, or that pressing enter will select "yes" in the focused window. Lets say im writing a message in chat and the duel prompt comes up, I press enter to send the message and I end up accepting the duel. Or if the prompt comes up with an intentinal prompt on your part and it gets obscured or whatever, discerning focused windows in this game is already a pain in the ass.
---
That's an obvious fix that makes everyone's life better, come on,

Search for Signal Cartel in game.
---
&gt; Adjusted the scenery in Hierarchy combat sites to reduce performance impact.
---
As someone who will occasionally run the Hierarchy sites for that sweet sweet drone mat/sentient drops, this is actually really nice. My computer sounded like it was going to take off into orbit and temps would go up at least 5-10°C just going into one of those sites with the gas cloud.
---
The problem is CCP is seen as being deaf and blind.

then go move to more dense space

---
Since sometime in early November. Idk exactly because I didn't see patch notes for it.
---
How about the dscan bug and the sensor overlay bug?
---
I have found the same with T2 ship production. I haven't really seen a decent market for it. Then again I haven't looked to far into it to say I would be completely out. I have had great success with T2 module production though. Only downside is the amount of time planning margins for inventions then to turn around to build T2. I know EVE IPH has the ability to do this, I just haven't had the time to dive into it yet.
---
&gt;You could have made it a bannable offense
---
or they can remove the chance of it happening and not rely on the super effective and responsive support team for it (and thats assuming they could even detect intent on it)
---
I meant 100 on 100 carriers with subcap fleet support
---
Weird flex but okay.
---
You said zero counter play. There's plenty available, I just shared two of the most obvious and used. 
---
Good to hear, that bug was seriously annoying :)
---
Ikr, i ran into this a few times and it was really annoying going from typing at 80-100wpm to like 20-30wpm because typing too fast felt like i was about to cause a socket d/c.
---
Piggles' knowledge of wormhole mechanics is second to none.
---
delet this
---
Great memories. The best part of that whole day is that while Mittens was blurfing they had a T3C fleet flying around looking for something to do and we took the left over ratting handouts hanger and a handful of people and would probe them down, warp in, gank a Proteus, die, reship and repeat. 
---
They eventually just docked up after they realized there was nothing to accomplish with the timers being changed and no one there to actually fight. 
---
Asset safety takes 20 days.  So you may want to avoid that.
---
Karmafleet is easy to get into.  Get into it, and have Goon JFs haul your stuff to Jita/Amarr.  Then drop corp.
---
Another alternative is to just make a well-priced courier contract.  Some player is going to have space in their JF and will move it even if you're not in the alliance.
---
only bosons don't work
---
&gt;but saddly all the stabbers in the world are no match for a few bubble bois at holding a group of capitals.
---
not with that attitude
---
Haha sup Jay. Fuck that. I'll mine in an Abaddon alpha as fuck.
---
Who says that highsec mining is not competitive lol
---
And I don't disagree with that perception. But I think we should all realize that perception isn't reality. And maybe, just maybe, that if we stop sperging and, in my eyes at least, almost verbally abusing them they might be more inclined to return to this platform to keep us more up to date. Which people might disagree with, as someone else has already told me in this thread 'CCP doesn't listen anyway', but I still feel is a better way to interact with people. I know I would be more enthusiastic to talk to the people who use my work if they didn't say to me 'Hey idiot, nerf rorqs u broke the game. Eve is ded. F U'. 
---
I'm not saying they are entitled to it, I'm just saying imagine how you would respond. Along the lines of catching more flies with honey.
---
for poor motherfuckers maybe
---
you'd be surprised
---
What ship is he in?  I've seen frigates go 14km/s and this was before mutagens.  I was friends with the guy, he shared his fit, and I confirmed in pyfa that it was real.
---
&gt; Sure, CCP isn't really handling the botting issue / perception correctly - but do we need threads + comments every single day about it?
---
Yes, getting CCP to improve can be done in one of two ways; Mass unsubscribing or a PR shitshow that will impact their income. r/eve is where that PR shitshow takes place :p
---
The official forums are a shithole these days, CCP made the mods stamp out anyone whose posting wasn't positive enough/in line with their point of view and all those people came to r/eve.
---
I don't mind scrolling through lots of complaints about all the shit CCP as a company is neglecting/doing wrong/etc because it allows me to hope one day well see an improvement :p
---
When you're happy about the game, you're busy playing.
---
When you're unhappy, you turn it off and post.
---
The math is easy.
---
&gt; Except its not deteriorating and is getting better.
---
we might have different opinions of "better."  From my perspective, there are serious mechanical flaws that allow continuous growth past a reasonable threshold, which makes it possible for entities to become so powerful that they actually cannot fight each other all-out without literally breaking the game.  Rorquals and injectors scaling infinitely create a situation in which alliances can continually grow stronger to the point where the game cannot handle an all-out throwdown between superpowers, and it's only going to get worse as Horde and Brave and Frat start reaching the level of Goons/NC/PL/Test.  The big goon brawl in the north last summer proved that two sides committing all their supers created a brawl so large it couldn't finish before downtime, and UALX proved that if two or more coalitions team up for such a battle, the server will simply crash before everyone can get into system.  
---
Hell, we fought panfam yesterday and lost 300b.  Without spinning a narrative or anything(already replaced etc.. etc..), I can tell you that 99% of Test pilots didn't even care about losing the fight because they can replace their ships so easily.  For many, losing a dread is now similar to losing a Maelstrom 3 years ago, and the game cannot support this kind of system.
---
I believe the only comments in the post are actually TEST.   
---
When you learn these things, you'll be ready to graduate from Brave.
---
Navy vexor lol, he was exploiting. Even had somebody working with CCP comment on it - yet he never saw a single day of ban as i watched his zkill activity for at least a month.
---
brave could really learn a thing or two from salt farmers
---
autz is a myth, do not fall for the bamblooze
---
So you're a meme fit peasant.... and the difference is... what?
---
Me too. Me too... ._.
---
The fuck are you talking about?
---
... Mar5hy predominantly hunts goons and cloaky camps their systems 
---
didn't rvb cease operations a while back? happy to see them become again active
---
True that tbh. Dunno. You can only hope to prevent it as soon as you are a target not much you can do but sit and die. Even just getting bumped so you can't align/warp out. I guess i just get shocked at freighters getting ganked empty now. It is certainly far far more common than it once was. 
---
That doc is amazing, thanks a bunch for sharing. I was also told to use pathfinder so checking that out as well.
---
You're referring to this, right?
---
&gt;Being tethered to an Upwell Structure will no longer prevent an Interdictor from activating Interdiction Sphere Launchers. Once launched, the bubble will prevent the ship from being re-tethered until it expires.
---
The defect was that if you were tethered then you were blocked from launching the bubble. The fix is to let you launch the bubble even when tethered.  
---
The anti-tethering once the bubble is in space was always there. I think it is just mentioned in the patchnote as a reminder.
---
Tried to resist. Couldn't.
---
Short range missiles: 
---
Rage: more damage less range/app
---
Javelin: more range less damage/app
---
Long range:
---
Fury: the same as rage
---
Precision: more app less damage/range
---
Thats really all there is
---
&gt; TEST is fighting this in High Sec for you
---
looooool yeah probably
---
It was not an aggression, sorry if it feels so.
---
I mean that maybe the conditions to notice the bug where not present before, so all we can say is that the bug was present before you noticed it.
---
at most at the
---
While bumped use your alt to create a new warp out since you will be aligned somewhere in space at the right speed. 
---
* Killmail whoring
---
* Activating drones that have been assisted to the FC.
---
I mean, you're not wrong. However I would make the same argument about TEST or Goons. When you break down actual form-up numbers
---
NC. - 4k members - 500 man form-up - 12.5% attendance
---
TEST - 16k members - 500 man form-up -  3.1% attendance
---
P. Horde - 16k members - 500 man form-up - 3.1% attendance
---
Goons - 36k members - 500 man form-up -  1.3% attendance
---
So while yes all alliances have players that are not active, I would say the inactivity is equal in both alliances. 
---
Finally an eve video with not terrible music. +1
---
When you factor in goons being responsible for like 80% of all nullsec ratting and mining in the game, it makes sense that they're the most common target. They have more assets in space to drop on at any given time than anyone else in eve, by orders of magnitude. It would be pretty stupid to form a hundred people and take them to a region where they may not find anything, rather than a place where they're more or less guaranteed to find targets quickly

Exit Strategy is a good AUTZ group. They live in Wormholes and are heavily active and offer lots of fun. I've worked with them before and they are a fun group with lots of experience

eh? Did you watch Talking in Stations last night? I explained it, I am VERY happy with the fight. This is exactly why are here. We want to grow as an alliance and this is how you do it. We have been in half a dozen super/titan fights in the past 2 weeks. Dude, I don't want to sit around and rat/mine for years on end. I want to fight.. die.. enjoy the very end game stuff. Remember, we are up north by choice. We expect and want to get blobbed/super'd. Do it!

Yeah, part of this dates back to my memories of early EVE when i used to actually just fully AFK autopilot freighters round highsec as you just didn't have ganking like you do now. It happened but was much much more difficult. Now with alphas/skill injectors etc there isn't really any reason to not make alts, use them then potentially burn them if needed.

The reality is, I don't think ccp can afford to ban them. I think we are in a player bubble. Where maybe even half the daily active accounts are bots and cheaters. Ccp is too greedy to deal with the problems

Some changes compared to previous version:
---
 - Damage scales with bubble area, rather than radius
---
 - Range calculation takes better account of falloff
---
 - Introduced cap-need for hybrid and energy turrets

On the scan alts, yes they're normally alpha clones fitted with a probe launcher and probes, sister cores are b better than sister core probes.

Wormhole connections will collapse after some time, 16-20hes if I remember correctly, but they can also collapse if to much Mass is put through it. A while has a maximum amount of mass that can fit through it at once and it also has a maximum amount of mass it can take before it collapses. If a wormhole has a maximum amount of passage of 300 that can go through, anything that weighs more than 300 can't go through it. If the wormhole has a maximum capacity of 2000, then if you put ships through it that weighs 2000+-10% then it will collapse. So if you have a ship with a mass of 300 and you jump it through the wormhole with a Max cap of 2000 7times then it will collapse the wormhole. If you collapse the Wormholes static, a new static leading to the same type of space will spawn. (This is the very rough way of saying that he was rolling the statics of his wormhole)

Eve IPH is great. I used excel sheets for years and tried IPH alongside. It works flawless and makes calculations with current prices very simple.
---
Additionally, it can tell you with your assortment of bpo what is currently lucrative. For example, sometimes you can have good profits on t2 components if the material prices are low. So it could be worth to run a batch of components and sell these instead of making the final t2 item.

it's not a red timer for docking, just for tethering -- bubbles immediately expire when you dock, and presumably that applies to citadels as well
---
which bug ? having people on dscan with the exact distance ?
---
No idea. EvE managed in-game inflation because of the 'cost' of losing a ship. With more and more risk averse mechanics implemented, and the idea that you should be 'Safe' as a given nowadays unless you do something ridiculous is going to pave way for an interesting future! 
---
Obviously the guy making this ad only saw some EVE trailers but doesn't play the game

I think it would be a more honest graph, if the base range ammo would be taken as the base (1x multiplier) damage ammo.
---
Thanks for the daily reminder on how hard goons brigade this subreddit 
---
Living solo is doable. Living nomadically like you mentioned is also doable and won't attract as many campers as having a structure would. 
---
If you're in a wormhole, scanning is of the up most importance. Set up an alpha account and have 1-3 of the characters with probe scanner and probes logged off in the system to scan you back in if you get locked out. If you go through a whole that is edge of collapse (EOL) don't go through in unless you have that what and exit chain scanned out or have a probe launcher and probes fitted to your ship or in your cargo with mobile depots.
---
Having a structure helps a lot since you can store spare ships in there as well as ships for different activities: explo, ratting, gas harvesting, rolling BS,  hunting ships, cloky Proteus, ect...
---
If you want to live nomadically, then get a bunch of secure containers and anchor them in the system at safe spots. Once anchored they'll last for 30days from the last time that you opened them. 5days left on it? Open it to reset it back to 30days. Carry a mobile depots in you cargo though so you can refit so you can change what you want to do. Cloaky ships are normally the best for living nomadically as well as T3D. I'd recommend the astero/stratios/T3C and an astero/pacifier/T3D(confessor) for C13s

I've been a bit back and forth on whether to translate or not.  The advantage is that any translation at all means if your native language is Russian and you tend to view YouTube in Russian you might be able to find the video and we do have a few Russian and German speakers in Bombers Bar.  Having said that, I agree, I'm not always happy with the translations.  I have to think on it a bit more.
---
That is pure gold. 
---
Awesome - and yeah, the sensor overlay is rarer/doesn't annoy people as much, apparently. And it's much harder to reproduce because it doesn't happen all the time.
---
The sensor overlay sometimes does not load fully/properly after you enter a system. It will half-load anomalies/structures/etc. but you cannot right-click them in space to warp to them. You have to manually disable and enable the sensor overlay to refresh it, then it usually loads things fully.
---
Training each racial frigate/destroyer/cruiser/Battlecruisers/battleship to 3 as well as each level of weapon to 3 would allow you to fly each T1 ship with ok skills and use the weapons that go well with them. This will allow you to match whatever their doctrine at some level. Exploring is extremely profitable, assuming you don't keep dying which takes learning, and in wspace everyone should know how to scan. There are plenty of stuff to do in wspace
---
Please be astra drifter farming
---
Fair enough. The bug is very visible though if you play the game, at least if you pvp: ships suddenly appear out of nowhere in the middle of the battlefield as if they were decloaking and sitting untargetable for ages without a way to tell when they will actually turn active because you don’t see them land; if you chase or you’re chased your duplicate will appear at the exact spot where you’re going to land... It definitely is recent and massive and I’m sure ccp will have no trouble tracking down the moment it appeared when they will actually do their job instead of throwing out worthless events and crappy skins.
---
Yes.  Sometimes I'm a bit nervous.  I might start recording from a recon instead to get better quality footage.  Problem is the recording stops when I die, but yeah there's like at least a minute of that video which is me staring at my warp out cause at any second I might get red boxed.  Thanks for the feedback.

AOC is not leading change - she's getting as much push back from her own party and she's alienating herself from the rest of the Congressional Democrats by being a spotlight hound. And, frankly, a lot of what she's suggesting either won't work or has been discredited.
---
It's not a waste if someone votes for me who doesn't share my perspective. There are ten slots on the CSM, and voters - in my opinion - should be voting for who they think will do the best job, not who will simply advocate for whatever their personal playstyle is. Because, after all, the impact a CSM member has is based on their influence, soft leadership skills and the like, not based on what they do in game or the alliance/coalition they come from.  
---
When nobody else is listening, voting for the guy who is generally is a good thing, isn't it?  In the end, voters choose who they think is the better of the 2 (or 10) candidate for the job (based on their own subjective views as to what makes up better). 
---
Your view is the view of a computer algorithm - take this "test" about your political views, and here's the person who aligns most with those views. That ignores a lot of different things that matter to people - character traits, soft skills, personal background, for instance. Choosing who aligns most with your views is one facet of the decision, but it's not the entirety.  95% of the stuff that folks in legislatures do, (and even more when it comes to the CSM) is based on things that don't align neatly into one ideological bucket.  Oftentimes you have competing priorities going into any single decision, and each one has benefits and detriments that need to be weighed. That's why we have people doing these jobs, not computers. 
---
Under your philosophy, if you agree 60% with me, but you agree 95% with somebody who doesn't show up to meetings, doesn't talk to anybody but their friends, and doesn't really care about being on the CSM or doing the job, you'd say vote for that person over somebody who is putting the work in but doesn't agree with everything you think.  Doesn't that strike you as dumb?

Super handy, thanks.

Incursions are just another form of grinding that require you to buy a loot piñata and wait in line to be allowed to grind. To make money without grinding you need to be clever. I hear there's good money in ganking incursion runners.

Did I say anything about DDing FAXes?  What we saw in UALX and X47 (were you in either of those fights?) was that if you failed to alpha a Titan, it caught reps and lived. But standard super cap doctrine is always to get rid of the FAXes first and then move to the supers/titans. FAXes are a bullet sponge.  Under your philosophy, no big group would bother bringing FAXes to a big fight, because alpha is all that matters. Obviously that's not true. 
---
As for your position, I try not to be that cynical, and I try to judge people based on what they do, not what I expect will happen.

If a game company lets people trade other people cash for in game currency/goods, government agencies start asking them questions like "What are you doing to stop criminal enterprises/terrorists from moving funds through here?" And also saying things like "Well, since people can move money through your game, your are a financial institution, and you are subject to regulation as such." The price tags on the related compliance costs are very high, so you won't see a game involving real world cash that thrives on any large scale for a sustained period.

I mean, in the last war when they lost the last keepstar battle that's exactly what the north did. Imperium was rolling around doing whatever they wanted after that, hence what, 3 uncontested keepstar kills? The defenders lose as much drive to form as the attackers, more if they're losing. Once that happens, it becomes exactly what I was talking about, just a grind to turn over all the citadels and sov. But modern wars seem to no longer be about taking space, just burning what your enemies have.
---
This is gold. Just what i needed to hear today :joy:
---
Just for future planning, if you’re able to occasionally dedicate a solid few-hour time block to the game incursions will end up being pretty good isk/hour in hisec. You can start off in a T1 battleship or a logi relatively cheaply once you have the skills up, and while it’s not much more interesting than missions, it’s better money.

Even though you can’t target the ghost before he actually exits out of warp, you can actually use commands like approach, keep at range or orbit the ghost to be ready to tackle/bump/cyno from the perfect spot.

C2 resident here o/

Biggest question you should ask yourself is do you like J-space that much so that you are ready to dedicate yourself to it?
---
I have lived in many different places (except SOV null) and I find myself most happy in J-space. Can't explain why, maybe because of the different audio, lol.
---
Several things that should help you to make a decision:
---
\- You should be ready to multibox. It is almost impossible to have fun with just one ship out there. 
---
\- As others noted C3 is your best static option for getting started. Other one can be HS/LS but not Null. Null is fun if you live with a group, not much to do there alone, especially for the beginner.
---
\- If everything is done properly you won't even bother with PI. Seriously, hauling that shit is just as much overwhelming as setting up high-tier production. 
---
\- I do 1 month of cost of fuel for my astra just in one casual evening. Do not worry about fuel costs.
---
\- Do not worry about equipping your astra with all the weapons and other defense modules. They take a lot of space to bring in. Depending on what you want it to look like, some of the modules might be expensive. No one is going to attack you in the first week after deployment. In fact, it is the most vulnerable until it is fully deployed with Service module installed and fueled. I have never got attacked for the past 2 months that I lived there.
---
\- The WH effect is as much important, as you static options. As you might think that the specific effect is helping you, you should realize that once you are facing an enemy, they will also benefit from that effect. And as you will be farming your connections more than your home system, it might be the best option if you live in the no-effect system. Just something to think about.
---
\- Never keep piles of loot in your citadel. When there is nothing to farm, or you are just bored, take your stuff to hisec. Even if you don't plan to sell it right away it is always good to take it to the safehouse once it hits specific amounts. I have been selling the blue loot and keeping salvage/relic/data loot I've got from exploration/salvaging. I have 2.5b worth of that shit now, that's for month and a half so far.
---
\- Salvaging is NOT a waste of time! It is a healthy process of keeping both your mind and your space clean! :D On a serious note - it is good additional ISK, with almost zero risk. You can't be endlessly farming combat anomalies, they either end, or there is K162 popping up, or just some random alpha explorer jumping into your system. In either case you want to just jump into you salvaging boat and go wreck those wrecks :D Unless you have Salvaging skill at 5 I suggest you put some Salvaging rigs (preferably T2) on your boat. This will not only allow you to salvage Battleship wrecks from C3s, but will also reduce your overall salvaging time to a minimum.
---
\- Don't be afraid to fly expensive ships. That's what a big discovery for me. I was always scared to fly 300mil ship in the space where anyone could blow it up with a snap of fingers. Now I'm not, as I know that 300mil is something I can do on a casual evening. I started to engage more into PvP. I started trying different things, not all of which end up well. There is no point in making all those billions if you are not blowing shit up, most of the time it's your shit, but those rare case when it's not are totally worth of.
---
\- it's OK to sit sometimes for hours in a system and just watch the d-scan. Especially when there are others in that system :)
---
\- No matter what - praise the Bob, and Bob will give more than he takes.
---

Yeah, I think it is stupid. In fact, I think everything about copyright is stupid--and spare me the lecture about how will artists profit--because part of the problem is that we live a world where we need to worry about shit like profit. 
---
Anyway, I digress. The 'reasons' you are talking kind of multifaceted. First, if they do not assert their copyright and trademark rights, the corporate legal hive mind worries about losing control of said trademarks and copyrights on the basis that they demonstrated their defacto relinquishment of those trademarks and copyrights by failing to defend them.   
---
However, the reason they would probably own up to is rather abstract and is not a 'problem' until it becomes reified by someone doing something bad. Essentially, by not cracking down on derivative work utilizing the Eve universe, they 'run the risk' of a third party believing that said derivative work is associated with the Eve IP and approved by CCP. 
---
The reasoning goes like this... If people think that non-approved derivative work is actually associated with CCP and EVE, then a person makes a derivative work, but does something fucked up with it like... I dunno... Let's say insinuates the Eve universe is really just like the Gor novels (google them), where rape and sexual slavery are a-okay, people will think this is what Eve, CCP, and the people who make it are about. Thus, irreparable 'harm' will have been done to the IP. 
---
Of course, this is kind of bullshit. For example, people write terrible fan fiction for Star Trek that has this sort of content, or other weird shit like Kirck/Spock fucking in it, and nobody actually thinks that Paramount/CBS/Whoever owns the Star Trek IP these days approve of said fiction, or that it is canonical to the IP.

I know I am going against the rest of the comments, but IMO these graphs don't add anything to the existing information, and make it more difficult for the reader to find the information they are seeking.  They may be "graph porn", but I don't think they are a great example of using a graph or chart to improve visualization of the information that is represented.
---
As a quick example, look at the energy crystal X axis which is labeled "Range".  You think, "Okay, left to right the range will be in order", so you want to know which energy crystal has the best range and look for the left-most bubble.  Is Multifrequency the shortest range ammo?  Nope, Gleam is, but because the bubbles and the pin-points on the graph aren't laid out consistently it requires additional effort to read the graph to make this determination.
---
If all of the damage information was consistently represented down and left of the dot that they represented then a user could probably make a more accurate visual determination before reading for specifics, but with the way the graphs are represented right now they're just colorful information that requires relatively significant amounts of time to read before having enough information.
---
I appreciate the effort, they'd make good, colorful backgrounds, but I'll stick to basic tables if I need to quickly compare flavors of ammo across a single ammo type.
---
Nice i like you add the ammo type legend

Underrated comment 
---
Happy to take some criticism.
---
For just one parameter (like range in your example) it's definitely easier to look at a table. But when you need to start comparing multiple parameters (Range/Tracking/Damage/DamageType/CapUsage) there is no easy way to compare all of these other than with this type of chart, unless you find it easy to look through tables for each parameter all at the same time. 
---
I'll take the point that the bubbles are laid out not so clearly, as you may have noticed this started with the projectile ammo from my previous post, which has multiple ammo types with the same range/tracking values, making it necessary to introduce these pins/lines. And in keeping with the same theme, I may have lost some clarity for the other weapon systems.
---
Either way, I'm reasonably happy with the result. And my only hope with making this was that it was helpful for some other people too.

Maybe it is time for the crabs to rise up and put the ore/bounties to use. Delve is good FarmVille simulator but it must be boring after so long

Yep, basically.  Reasons can be both legitimate and stupid at the same time.

There is some pretty good advice in here already but I'll give you some of my experience and play style.

I live in C3s solo(with alts) I periodically take breaks from the game and don't log in on a predictable/consistent schedule. So instead of anchoring a citadel that while get blown up while I'm offline I bring an alt in an Orca with me.

It's got a fleet hangar for refitting, a rather large ore bay that can hold onto some gas for you, a ship maintenance bay that lets you store a few different ships for certain purposes, and a lot of loot storage.

By contrast, I was always annoyed that hybrid and laser weapons have twice as many crystals as you'd ever want to pack because it's not worth switching ammo that fast.  There's a reason projectile ammo doesn't use the weird ladder it had once upon a time anymore, I suspect.

&gt; AOC is not leading change - she's getting as much push back from her own party and she's alienating herself from the rest of the Congressional Democrats by being a spotlight hound. And, frankly, a lot of what she's suggesting either won't work or has been discredited.
---
I'm not here to debate American politics with you. The point of AOC example was not that. One can find Republican examples as well. Not a lot of people knew whether they wanted a wall on the border before Trump, and now many do. The point is politicians create, popularize and lead agendas as much as representing their constituents agendas.
---
&gt; Because, after all, the impact a CSM member has is based on their influence, soft leadership skills and the like, not based on what they do in game or the alliance/coalition they come from.
---
No. If we accept that CSM is a means for CCP to make the game better, the impact of a CSM member is grounded in his ability to give CCP value feedback on mechanics that they can immerse themselves in, for the betterment of the game. Surely there needs to be a minimum level of soft skills so they can communicate cooperatively. But we don't necessarily need smooth or charismatic people. What we need is people who listen to feedback from the bottom and relay it to the top (for which you don't need to be charismatic). And you are good at this. But we also need people who are good at different parts of Eve. So they can sift through bad feedback they get from the bottom. And they can help CCP on matters which they have zero feedback from the bottom. And this "being good at different parts" include other stuff than empire building. Hence the need for a CSM body from diverse backgrounds.
---
&gt; Under your philosophy, if you agree 60% with me, but you agree 95% with somebody who doesn't show up to meetings, doesn't talk to anybody but their friends, and doesn't really care about being on the CSM or doing the job, you'd say vote for that person over ,e - somebody who is putting the work in but doesn't agree with everything you think. Doesn't that strike you as dumb?
---
No. I never said soft skills are unimportant, and I accept there needs to be a minimum. I also already accepted I'd rather you over absent CSMs, which means I value things like showing up. You construct your case at the extreme and portray someone who does not fit this minimum. 
---
But things change when you don't do this kind of straw man. The fact is, nobody campaigns on the premise that they'll be absent. And those who are absent are empire builders whose CSM memberships are guaranteed due to block voting. I have firm belief that non-null candidates like Tikktokk or Tifida would still have sufficient soft skills to be able to sit down and talk to CCP, and they wouldn't be one of the absent CSMs.
---
Now in this case, suppose my views align with 90% Tikktokk's and with 40% with yours. Further, suppose Tikktokk will talk to me 60% of how much you are talking to me. I am saying that, as long as he talks to me at a minimum 40%, and he won't be absent, and he won't fight with devs kicking the table, he is a better representative to me. The dumb thing would be me voting for you, just because you promise to listen, but when the time comes I know you'll relay the opposite, competing feedback to CCP. Meanwhile, all your campaigning point is "I'll be stable, I won't be a maniac, will listen to you and will be able to speak to CCP". Most functioning human beings can do that. You don't get to campaign on the premise of others' instability.
---
Do a meme one about wh groups power level? Not even joking, it could be a lot of fun. 
---
Ironic...
---
&gt; They have more assets in space to drop on at any given time than anyone else in eve, by orders of magnitude.
---
Delve is the best nullsec content in the game. Everyone else hides because they never caught up with the new Eve where winning means putting people in space and accepting the occasional killboard losses. This is a growing problem as the game continues to polarize into the content creators putting players in space, and the content consumers who produce nothing but expect others to provide targets for their killboards. So far the only other alliance that gets it is Test.

Stain is already pretty cool, it's full of very long pipes, with some of the most awkward systems I've seen in the game.  I don't personally think another gate to it would hurt this too much, but at the same time I agree with you, its isolation is part of its charm, and if just anybody could pop over for a weekend it might risk losing something.

Simple fix. Release faction caps for all races. Remove retarded Serp microprocessors. Make BPCs available in LP stores. Increase LP and ISK cost to a reasonable amount. Make Sotiyos drop BPCs with 10/20 research. Shorten the time they're in a system so they dont just sit there for a month on end.

Gate to Stain
---
If we don't alpha it gets reps there for the fax tanking less dps will hurt that, faxes are not taking primary damage in those fights, so their tank isn't relevant ( keep in mind you advocated for specifically a tanking nerf in the CSM minutes ), now the repping power nerf is somewhat relevant because it would theoretically slow down the rate of recovery and make the alpha window larger, in those fights with the tidi the impact is likely questionable at best. 
---
Faxes only really work as a bullet sponge when the other side has to remove them ( this means they lack the alpha to remove your titans/supers directly ). 
---
This is most common with dread bombs and while it's good throwaway dreads get a bit of a buff ( because god they need it ), this is of nearly no impact for any large fight. ( my original notion ), now yes I didn't go over in great detail why having reps against an alpha setup is relevant because it really isn't all that relevant for highlighting the lack of impact this change has on large fights, sure the person that loses alpha ability first is less screwed but they're still screwed. 
---
&gt;  I try to judge people based on what they do, not what I expect will happen
---
I can't judge you on what you do because what you do is secret and CCP will not tell the player base about it, all I have is a bunch of CSM minutes, a platform ( election promise ), and some vague feel-good claims about being there for everyone that doesn't demand redirect action. ( and are vague enough that they can simply be ignored when it's convenient to do so ). 
---
The only other hard evidence of your stance we have is well the clubs you sign up for (aka eve corps).
---
But let's judge you on what you do because you ask for it, has eve in the last year become more or less fun to play. 
---
Now if you ask me that question the response is less fun, so based on that blanket assessment your position isn't saved. 
---
The reason wormhole space is stale is because whenever a group comes up they leadership usually gets poached by bigger names cause everyone’s internet glamour shocked and will dump their friends and leave the corp to die.

---
That's not all. Unless CCP actively defends their IP by taking down *all* derivative works they come across, they might actually *lose* the IP. That is, if they don't take down the unlicensed fan comic or TTRPG that is being distributed for free, they might not be able to do so when someone else decides to make one for profit.

https://github.com/evepraisal/evepraisal-google-sheets

Literally make a Google Sheet, and it can pull the corp wallet(s). You can set certain filters to get it to pull all the income from taxes, from donations, contracts, etc. and the expenses can be broken down similarly; then just set date ranges to get it to populate the profit-loss sheet as you like for a given period. Requires a bit of set up and excel-style know how (although that can be Googled), but then it'll run nicely, and very customisable as to what 'types' you want to break it down to (eg do you want tax income as a single entry, or to break it down further by tax from bounties, project discovery, custom House usage, etc.?).

I dont know whats with all the downvotes, most people here would have jumped into the rats than into the orthrus.
---
noice
---
I know that feeling.  One of the things I really wanted to get into in Eve for a long while was logistics, not just repping ships but moving freight.  Of the nullsec groups I joined though, they just had one or two guys with JFs and a couple alts who could handle pretty much all the needs of the corp themselves, if not the entire alliance.  Wormholes provided some decent logistical challenges, but again people generally just packed lighter and one or two guys were usually more than enough to haul stuff to market when we got a good exit.
---
It's nice if people want to just hop on and pewpew, but then again you can stage out of lowsec for that purpose.  I remember one of the things that attracted me to Eve way back when was how difficult and challenging it was to live in the deepest corners of space, having to haul goods in and learn to manufacture on-site.  But these days people just kind of hop to Jita and back no matter where they are.
---
I'm sure such gates appear on a periodic basis, no?
---
I wish I was cool

"Fixed an issue where charges could get stuck in an empty fitting slot if the module was removed while charges were being loaded."

YES! This happened to me plenty of times when trying to quickly switch fitted command bursts.

That was something someone at CCP said (can't remember who) to justify fighter nerfs last summer.

Proof of 240m ticks was, iirc, never provided, but the statement became a meme for a while.

I know. I think that whole mechanism is dumb. Might as well just make it randomly explode after 48 hours like a big retarded loot pinata for all the bads to come fight over. 
---
The eve thing would be that he knew about it and has been manipulating markets and alliances that know it by keeping the gate from being constructed. 5d wizard hat chess.

It’s a new weapon set of continuous “energy” beams released for a new faction of Triglavian ships. ED weapons have the unique property that their damage increases the longer one target is shot, which gives them considerable firepower when used properly. 
---
The problem with a large amount of raw threads is the limited link space real estate. Typically only the top 10-15 threads get any meaningful traction. Not to mention they only get a very brief window of opportunity in the new queue to even make it to that slot. Thus, if you have several duplicate or at least same topic threads you effectively start pushing out other topics / threads from view. Reddit has the decaying thread / karma system so the system distinctly lacks a benefit of old forums: near guaranteed visibility for new threads.
---
Keep in mind that some very iconic / important threads that have come and gone through r/eve were sitting at 0 views until a mod made some 'space' for it to get some visbility. There are some threads that have nothing happen for 30 minutes then get crazy amounts of traction due to a thread link position change.
---
But yeah tl;dr: finding a way for people to complain about it as much as they want without also drowning out other topics is the goal here. I definitely don't want to silence people who are upset at CCP for whatever reason but there's only so much space and other topics exist.
---
Weapons on the new Trig ships.
---
They are effectively beam weapons that have no falloff and only optimal range, and ramp up their damage, with the tradeoff that it's the only weapon type trig ships can equip, and that once ships get out of their optimal range, they straight up shutdown.
---
Found the Blood Raider.
---
Good job CCP!
---
It's hard to keep being nice after so many many years of being ignored. The only thing that is going to change anything is if more players leave and thats a sad but true statement. If it gets to a point of CCP losing money as the subs or microtransaction are no longer enough then alarmbells start ringing for them.

Now can you imagine how many communications someone like Falcon receives? If I get blown up this hard from the subreddit alone - they definitely get it several orders of magnitude worse.

---
&gt; I think for many people who have started playing, myself included, Eve doesn't feel like it's dying. 
---
Eve isn't dying but a certain paradigm / play style is. Lately a lot of the old guard have been rotating out for a myriad of reasons. To them and people of a similar mindset (or even just used to see certain people around) it can definitely feel like it's dying. In a way it is - if everything you enjoyed about Eve was permanently killed off you'd probably feel it was dead too.
---
We hit a point with this last northern war where a lot of old conflicts kind of resolved all at once. We got our 'next B-R' and the 2 main mega groups who've been hitting each other for years finally went full bore at each other and a clear victor was decided. - Yet this has all happened before with various groups over the years and things turned out fine.
---
Couple that with a slow dwindle in average online logins and it's clear why people get this impression. Something people forget though is average concurrent logins can also be indicative of an *average playtime decrease* and not an *average player decrease*.  The ones that do realize this also content that an average playtime decrease is similar largely due to lack of interest. I'd argue that Eve's average player base age went up a bit and with that average game time per capita likely went down. I could be completely wrong - but so could they. It could also be somewhere in the middle. The point is to not believe anyone claiming the game is definitively losing active players at an alarming rate on just the concurrent login charts alone (More evidence you ought to consider though). It's entirely possible (Though I don't think so) that Eve has more players now than it's ever had but that those players just average 30 minutes per day instead of 40 minutes per day.
---
Eve will be dead when whatever you want to do in the game is no longer possible, you've already done it or it costs too much to do.
---
Or when it stops getting major patches and goes into maintenance mode. That's a p. good indicator.
---
Correct, and I believe I said that's the very first reason that's really in the brain of corporate legal hive mind. The second is also a reason, and probably one they would actually fess up to; however, again, fan fiction for all sorts of things exists all over the internet. From a legal point of view, while it is true if you do not pursue copyright or trademark infringement you *could* lose said rights, you do not actually need to go after everyone. 
---
As that fan fiction for literally every significant IP that exists all over the internet, not only do you not really need to go after every derivative (unless they are trying to make money off it, then you *absolutely* need to go after it for the above reason), but it is also impracticable to do so in many cases.

1 )Get virtues, scan a fuckload and always look for ghost sites.
---
1.1) get on scanning webapps like tripwire, siggy, or pathfinder. Put everysite you scan out here so you can like see a map of your chain. Also make note of peoples citadels.
---
1.2) when entering a new wormhole always bookmark your way home, warp around and look at whats out in space. Take note of citadels, vulnerabilities and what have you. Get a ship scanner and data analyzer so you can look at peoples fits and see when their timers are. Do this to all the major PVP corporations you come across and judge the data for yourself. Enter notes on populated wormholes so you can see them on siggy. Enter all your red scannable sigs (I like to filter on and off my anomalies when I don’t need them.) 
---
1.3) to be a good scanner you want to look for ghost sites and scan K-spaces. K-spaces have many connections. 
---
1.4) always have D scan &amp; the probe scanner window open and out on your HUD. You can put them in the same window if you want but when you scan everything ignore all your scanned signatures in system so when you travel the chain you know when a new signature occurs.
---
1.5) train all the scanning skills &amp; get mid grade virtues on any scanning character.
---
2 )Make a bait channel. The channel I have with all my alts looks like a killmail so whenever I think someone is afoot I say something in local akin to GF FC. And I post a link to my channel named After a killmail with something shiny like a pally and nobody can resist.
---
2.1) put that link in your bio among a list of other real killmails for ultimate bait.
---
3) DO PI. Jesus the best isk in a C2 is PI! Make all your 3 characters able to do PI. Get really into PI. You can make a few bil a month.
---
4) don’t overextend. Whenever possible use the cheapest method of krabbing (ratting). Make copies of BPOs in bulk and keep them in highsec or lowsec.
---

---
Pick a static based off where you think you can efficiently krab in space. If you need Highsec to live I suggest finding a lowsec /c3 static. If you’re a pro and want to make dank isk, dont mind scanning, but still want a C2, get a C2 with a C5/NS static. It’s where HK moved to. You always have C5 space &amp; a NS for logistics like Jump freighters. 
---
7) Blueloot gets bought en mass by NPC buy orders. Amarr proper has NPC buy orders for blueloot.
---
8) guess peoples passwords on pos’s. I have a corpmate who did this and won a rorq.
---
9) talk to people, be nice and fight. Fighting is a sport here. 
---
10) learn to fly good solo nano ships. Like the orthrus, muninn, phantasm, Osprey Navy issues &lt;3.
---
11) useful alts include: PI, transport ships, highsec market alt, scanners &amp; hole seeders. &amp; dreadnaughts.

I appreciate it when people don't blow me up for running their sites in their rented system.

Can anyone recommend a nice Rattlesnake fit with RHMLs for nullsec anom ratting? I have good dps numbers, but I think it needs some help with cap.
---
Same question for RHMLs Ravens or Typhoons, except for nullsec pvp where I need to serve as my own tackle.

If that should include gate guns it did not work. I'm missing a heroic and elite Rifter kill.
---
&gt; I just made the point that comparing CCP to Walmart is overly dramatic and disingenuous to the conversation we are trying to have.   
---
So it's not overly dramatic or disingenuous at all. When you are speaking to someone you don't know, but trying to communicate a concept they don't really seem to understand, you try to relate the concept to them as an individual. It's a pretty commonly taught communication practice that you'll pickup in pretty much any public speaking class.   
---
There's a very good chance, based on the types of people that play Eve, that the hypothetical that I used (a Wal-Mart manager being asked by a customer to drop prices today for a potential gain tomorrow) would relate to OP in some way. OP might shop there, or at a similar retail chain, or work for a similar company (large super-corporation by definition employ a lot of people and service many millions more), so OP would probably understand the similarity between what he was asking and what I had demonstrated as effectively, asking a lower level employee to do something they don't have the power the change.     
---
&gt; But you absolutely have to push it because it helps your narrative so by default I'm wrong and I don't comprehend how large business works(even though CCP isn't one and doesn't operate even remotely similar)       
---
So, this is just fundamentally false, and only serves to help you back peddle out of the conversation you dropped yourself into. I gave you an example two posts up of a similar situation to what OP is asking for wherein the only interaction required was a CEO and an employee, which is basically the definition of a small business. You choose to ignore that, and focus on "big business" because you think it's your out.    
---
I'm not really pushing a narrative, CCP is, in fact, a small development company. It is also true that they are, in fact, owned currently by Pearl Abyss, and previously by a group of private investors with voting control over the company. CCP staff have openly spoken to the fact that they were previously, at the time citadels were released, owned by a majority, by private investors. There's even an Icelandic news article regarding how much Hillmar made from the PA acquisition, wherein he defines the percentage of the business he actually owned, which was nowhere near 51%, which is what you require for creative control that would conflict with investor demands. Which, does in fact make the situation of creative control very similar to a publicly held company in terms of the investors or shareholders ability to determine the direction of the company, and how little power your average employee has, and speaks directly to OPs request to stop catering to casual players, which are, in fact, a cash cow for then investors, and now, PA.   
---
&gt; Hope that clears it up for you.

This is the best of EVE right here
---
I think the whole point, which you are missing, is that it isnt. Reddits importance is purely self-referential. CCP isnt sitting around at a round table worried about what people say on reddit. It doesn't matter if they post here sometimes to keep in touch with you and see how you feel. 
---
It's not onboarding it's waterboarding
---
Honestly looking at your main points vs. what ultimate got changed it appears that the brunt of your issue is more closely related to the speed of response than it is to the issues themselves.
---
I fundamentally believe a simple "Hey guys, we know XXX is an issue. I don't know what we're going to end up ultimately doing yet but we're looking at it right now. We need to process what's really happening with XXXX and look at it in an objective manner (with data) but please sit tight for a little while longer while we work this thing out" would be far more potent if done early enough than teleporting banning supers to a massacre (though that was pretty awesome).
---
I get the distinct impression CCP is afraid of the reaction that kind of response can generate - especially after the 270mil tick fiasco - but it's simply what works. If the community is rioting at you because you worded something wrong or picked a bad example when trying to help - that's something you can manage and hell it's even fixable if you own up to your mistakes and continue on. Don't let them push you around, but explain - clearly - why you're doing something and reply to the feedback you get of the explanation (This is where I feel most of CCP is lacking, but then again the ones I feel doing it well are the ones who specialize in this sort of thing).
---
holy shit,you weren't kidding. Eurotruck Simulator too is real up there
---
Yeah :(
---
These are criticisms that I agree with with the exception of injectors (I do think it is perhaps too easy to just completely self fund yourself with skill farms but in terms of abilities granted my skill injectors I dont think they really causes imbalance as we had character trading before.)  However, I will point out that this is still better than PL back in the day utterly crushing every fight above subcaps within minutes (I remember those times...they were dark times.)  Which is one example of changes made that I believe made the game better (and further then eventually fixing the super long waiting of jump fatigue.)
---
you nailed it

Expecta petron a

OP asked about C2 sites, I was just trying to answer that with my own experience of living in a C2. I didn't run C4 sites as I was low skill and solo. I didn't have the dps or ehp to run C4 sites. But yeah, maybe I was just doing it wrong. Serious question - what do you use to run C4 sites solo?

R/Eve is full of people who dont post on their mains, troll and have clear lack of understanding basic game mechanics (yes, you could say the same about the official forums)
---
See how that works? Reddit loves to proclaim its superiority to other forums and it's own importance and "impact", whilst it labors with a structure that encourages anonymity, gimmick posting, and a popularity contest that rivals any high school drama. It's no different, and not just a little worse in a lot of ways.
---
Yeah, let’s all be hunky dory that ccp is happy to make this game krabs online with optional player interaction. 
---
There’re always changes to be made and shit that’s broken. You’re like an ostrich that thinks we should all put our heads in the sand. 
---
From your post it certainly seems you have the foresight of one as well. If nobody spoke up about any issues carriers would’ve never been nerfed from their initial change and the Drake navy never would’ve been given a utility high. 
---
How can you expect devs who don’t even play this game beyond being mindless krabs know what’s wrong with it? 
---
Or is it revenant?
---
Bots never mine solo
---
I'm glad I only spent 300m on it
---
Its all true.  Its still a great game, better then anything I know of, but it is not as great as it used to be back when I started in 2010 or so.  Yes there is a lot of flying around looking for something to shoot, but when you find something to shoot it is worth it.  It is not too late to join, and with alpha you don't have to spend a dime, but if you want to have max enjoyment then you should probably be a subscriber and have at least one paid account (like 15$ a month).  OFC you can plex your account so you dont even have to pay the 15$ if you have more time then dollars on your hands.
---
Apparently not long enough. My advice would be refrain from posting to not to be considered as a total dickhead, but its too late mi thinks.

Reddit is infinitely better because you can downvote trolls and tell them to fuck off whereas on the forums if you even suggest that a troll is wrong you get reported and banned.

I'll get back to you with an update at XXX time." would be far more potent if done early enough than teleporting supers to a massacre (though that was pretty awesome).

I honestly cannot remember the last time I read that sort of thing when it wasn't damage control weeks or months after the fact.

Why should anyone bot in higjsec when you can bot in dronelands?

Well you can try the game for as long as you want as an Alpha and you can come to your own conclusions. The game is old, but updated regularly, I came back last month and play as an Alpha and still have a blast finding people to shoot. But keep in mind this is a sandbox, you make your own fun, those reviews about "waiting for things to happen" can be anything from people not taking the initiative and looking for trouble to a front line grunt in a huge alliance waiting for the call to charge in.
---
As much as this community can be rough around the edges it is very devoted and has many outlets to help a new player in what ever avenue they wish to pursue. But before you really come to a conclusion try a few things. I did mining and missioning (PVE) when I first began, got really bored of it and almost quit. I put together a poorly fit Thorax and tried my hand a piracy, got my butt handed to me, but invited to a corporation, which then the CEO booted me mere hours later due to being a noob \*womp womp womp\* but later that day the same thing happened. Got in a fight with some random player and we became instant friends, playing together for years until they finally won the game and started a family. So really go out there and do what interests you.
---
As for sinking money into the game the only thing really is you can unlock the rest of the game as Omega with a subscription, there's nothing like golden ammo like other games, but there are mechanics like skill injecting and plasmids (loot box-ish) that is it's own box of worms.

it's the most pay-to-win game there is, but money and skillpoints are outshadowed by personal player skill and knowledge, so it's effect isn't that bad.

it's getting there because of recent ccp decisions
---
&gt; Is the game still good? 
---
it used to be 'good'
---

it's really niche and always has been, so it's either for you or it isn't.

&gt; From what I've seen this subreddit isn't the best place to ask this but, I don't know where else I could.

it's probably the best place to ask

&gt;The positive reviews say the game is an awe-inspiring experience with amazing graphics and excellent gameplay. The negative reviews say the game is just flying around, waiting for things to happen, and that the game has become a PTW hellscape.
---
they're both right, it's a niche game and it either gives you that fix or it doesn't. 
---
Reddit's post/comment voting isnt some magical defense against trolling dude. In fact, its voting is perfectly designed to destroy thoughtful posting. If an opinion, however valid, is disagreed with here it isnt given equal anything. It dies instead of fostering brisk debate in too many instances to be useful for anything good.

Play the alpha.  It allows you to try the game at no cost, and you’ll have made the decision to buy a monthly sub after you start playing.   
---
My own .02$ though is to not play.   Not unless you like raging.  Not unless you like crying constantly.   Not unless you like the downward spiral of madness.   
---
I played the game with a friend.  It was fun for a few months, learning how to play, discovering all the skills and ships and modules you can fit.   It was exciting, it was new. And just when you get to the part where you’re semi knowledgeable and want to experience the greater part of eve..... you meet the other players.  
---
They will make your eve experience miserable.   They will gank you for no reason (well, they get to taste your salty tears which sustains them), try to scam you at every step of the way, gank you, scam, gank, gank, gank, oh yeah, they blow up your capsules as well.  
---
But besides that, try the game out.  I did enjoy it for a couple of months, and you might have a better experience and stick with it longer.  It has a lot to offer.  It’s just not very beginner player friendly.  
---
From somebody who played quite a bit in 2018 and quit:
---
When the game was fun it was lots of fun. So many things to learn and consider, so many ways to make money and people to meet. The player groups are fun and PvP was exciting. When the game is boring it is excruciating. Lots of time waiting for something to happen or looking for things to do. There are a lot of times spent looking and looking for something, finding that thing, and being killed immediately by a player with much better equipment and more money than you have. I liked the game a lot but ultimately what drove me to stop was the combination of the pay to win elements and the long stretches of waiting for things to happen. It’s difficult to earn money in game and it’s always constantly in your mind that it would be a lot easier to just buy plex and get it over with rather than grind a million hours for some ship that will probably get blown up by a gate camper anyway. Just my experience. 
---
And marketers doubly so. Thanks CCP :(
---
The author didn't do it for profit so I am sure hes fine about CCP bending him over backwards. But you gotta give it to the guy that he did put a whole lot of time and effort into his idea and he deserves some gratitude for that (something like 40+ pages of writing?). Its nowhere near perfect but with a bit of work it may be decent.
---
&gt; in terms of abilities granted my skill injectors I dont think they really causes imbalance as we had character trading before
---
the difference is that if you wanted a titan pilot, you had to buy a titan pilot from someone who had trained one.  Today, you can inject as many titan pilots as you want overnight, with SP that was pulled from characters that could have been anything, or even nothing.  Your titan could be made with injectors from 100 different 5.5m SP toons. 
---
Creating a new titan pilot used to take *someone* years, even if you didn't do it yourself.  Now those years can be split among 100 SP farmers and complete in weeks.  People used to train titan pilots because they knew that eventually they could sell it, even though it had to be subbed and basically unusable for years.  Now they can create an SP farm that pays itself off monthly when it extracts, so you recoup the monthly sub every month.  It's no longer an investment, but a passive revenue stream.

Seems legit.

The issue is whether it's become more or less fun based on changes CCP has made, and what impact the CSM had on those changes.

This is the problem: "Because I know when the time comes I know you'll relay the opposite, competing view to CCP." You don't know that, any more than I know what I'll advocate before I advocate it. I also make it clear when I present a position that here's the opposite view as well, because in the end CCP is going to make their decision, and if I tell them "I like this, everybody will like it, go for it" and then everybody hates it, I look either like I played them, or I'm an idiot, and I don't want them thinking either of those things. 
---
These is EVE - most functioning people can't promise to be stable, not a maniac, will listen and be able to speak to CCP. But between that and what I have done in the game, my perspective and experience, that's what made me a credible candidate in the first place. 
---
i hope so - otherwise eve is going to be very one sided and boring for the foreseeable future.

I've been away from the game for about 8 years, playing a lot in 2009 -&gt; 2011. I flew Sabres in 0.0 90% of the time, and I'm curious on if there have been any mechanical changes or things to be aware of with interdiction, aggro, logging off in space, or Sabres in general since I last played heavily. Thanks!
---
Theres a few spots in that area that spawn some great loot (for high-sec). I've personally sat on their with a weird dominix fit or with praxis just being a meat man with cargo expanders and drones. You can make a killing off shuttles, or rare pieces for manufacturing. 
---
Those cosmic sites are sweet on their own but the cosmic mission chains are insane (albeit relatively hard and on the obscure side. I'm so glad I did them though. The goodies you get from them are wowzers. There was a guide somebody gave me, if anyone wants it I can pass it along, but it should be accessible otherwise. If you fail/cancel a mission the entire chain goes dead (as far as I know). 
---
Also, fyi theres two brainlet carriers that camp all day in Ihakana, seriously. All they do is snag mission runners coming from Friggi, Otitoh, going in and out of  [**Otomainen**](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/The_Forge/Otomainen) . Just FYI, incase anyone wants to start doing this cosmo mission chains. 
---
They'd be pretty easy to pop IMO, I've been thinking about it for far too long, just don't have the resources or power. Not hard to figure out who they are, they're the only active ones in the system. [https://zkillboard.com/system/30000169/](https://zkillboard.com/system/30000169/)

You forgot this part:

&gt; While reddit is pretty bad sometimes, at least the user group who participates is more diverse. As in you get a lot small gang, null FC's, f1 warriors, solo, lowsec and even some high sec guys that take part in the discussions. Which can help give better perspective about things. 
---
There are a lot of similarities between the forum and reddit, i never said otherwise. I use both. The forums are not as traveled as much as reddit is. You end up in an echo chamber of a vocal few hating any kind of change. As reddit is more diverse, you will get those same people, but you will also get people who actually have the same playstyle as you or experience in what is being discussed. For every HS/NS carebear that would respond on reddit, you'll also get a few small gang guys or fleet guys. On the forum you will mainly get carebears and gankers. I value reddit's feedback a smidge more than the forums as the individual player experience on average is higher than that on the forums. 
---
Take for example the same topic, 1 on reddit, 1 on the forum:

---
While there are some side Topics on the reddit thread. There is an overall consensus that its a reasonable change (even my comment about increase warp speed faired relatively well). A lot of other people chime in about things like the BLOPs sig res, which after looking into, is pretty comparable to most battleships after cloak, but they could stand to increase their sig res as well, to help their role.
---
On the forum, there is 1-2 guys discussing it, 1 guy who doesn't even understand the concept of why its a problem and just thinks i should have a squad of frigates following around every battleship to kill EC drones. Even Brisc (CSM) seems very non-chalant about it and says i should put a SEBO on my battleship, which again, completely misses the point of the topic.

The state of the game is not that bad. People are whiny little bitches.

Reverse that joke so the shattered hip was fixed and the scrape was ignored and you'd be a bit closer to the truth. They fixed a TON of bugs in this patch - big ones - and are planning to oll back to the old chat system.

&gt; it's literally the worst platform for discussion on a game that goes completely against what the average gamer wants i.e. call of duty &amp; world of warcraft

The funny part about your comment is that you're decrying the sub in a hand wash sort of way in a thread that would never see the light of day on the official forums.

&gt; on a game that goes completely against what the average gamer wants i.e. call of duty &amp; world of warcraft
---
You make the flawed assumption of assuming an average opinion is the one most viewed. Yet, reddit (and r/eve) is quite known for 'changing its mind' aka having different opinions get traction at different times. Reddit isn't about amalgamation of opinion - reddit is about being *first*. The entire platform is designed for speed and the common things you see thrown around are what is *first* and not what is the always the most popular. Seriously, one upvote in the first 10 minutes is worth somewhere around 50 upvotes at the 2 hour mark. You can easily flip the perceived narrative on a subreddit by just lurking /new and commenting. In fact this is something that people do constantly and they do *not* agree.
---
It's that or 100k + reply megathreads that have an OP who died in 2013 and the guy you're replying to will never check the thread again because he's also been dead for a long time much like old forums.

I miss how sparsely populated it was too. You could jump through a lot of systems and you were really on your own. You didn't have logistics from high sec. You didn't have citadels. You lived out of a POS or if you were lucky to build one, a station. Eve was big.
---
Asking if a game is still "relevant" (whatever the fuck that means) on the active subreddit for said game. 
---
I'll take "stupid questions" for $200 Alex
---
Citadels, coming back after 10 years its a trip to me to see so much going on in null. 
---
It's not like it's terribly different, I used to mine in null, the corp would process it at a POS, then we'd form a fleet to escort the shipment to HS.
---
I don't believe in Care Bears, first I think they are mostly alts, second, even if all you want to do in Eve is mine, trade, hual, and run production, that is what the game is to some people. 
---

Hey there i5 8400 and a r9 380 4gb bro here, I've experienced the same thing but dropping to 30-40fps rather than 1 until I restart

Why do you keep saying goons were scared off when you are a goon?

I've never fully understood what logi is.

You're also only one dude who volunteered, rather than a team that gets paid.

&gt; If an opinion, however valid, is disagreed with here it isnt given equal anything. It dies instead of fostering brisk debate in too many instances to be useful for anything good.
---
Some of the most viewed and replied to comments / threads of all time are also the heaviest downvoted. Downvotes don't erase the community interaction. In fact, downvotes often work exactly the same as upvotes but far more amplified. Typically if a comment as -50 karma it has a boatload of replies. +50 on the other hand... not so much.
---
The fact that reddit as a controversial sort and a controversial tag matters a *lot*. On top of this, people naturally check what the "worst" part of a thread is. Pay attention to medium / large threads in particular. You will see high activity at the top and high activity at the bottom while the middle remains dead.
---
Saying it's designed to destroy thoughtful posting demonstrates ignorance of the platform. In my view the sheer size of reddit is throwing you for a loop on this one. People tend to use the front page of r/all as the base line of 'viewed posts' and thus jump to the conclusion you are making when in reality there are threads that you will never see or hear of that get *millions* of views - yet get no where near r/all or r/popular.  Reddit has grown on the level of youtube / facebook.
---
Remember when evolution of dance was the highest viewed youtube video of all time for *years*? It's at 304 million views.  Despacito is at 5.8 billion. Does that make evolution of dance any less impactful?

We're trying our best to turn INIT into TEST, let it happen

You can see the init flair is fake, because there are no 60goons covering in case he misses. Almost got me harvey, almost got me...

Dont you have a rock to go eat?
---
The PTW comment is silly, the soft skills (how to play, what to do, etc) are far more important that the ingame skills or equipment.  It's more pay-to-get-more-stuff-blown-up.
---
The waiting for stuff to happen is real, but that's the nature of a game in which meaningful stuff happens in realtime.  You have to get a fleet together for a particular time, you can't wait till the last second for everyone to get shipped up - there's going to be some "let's get organized" time.
---
The combat is more realistic in the sense that it's not how quick you are at aiming or trigger-reflexes that decide battles, it's how well you planned and prepared.  Thus the time "doing nothing" while planning and preparing.
---
If you want a FPS twitch shooter, this is definitely not it.  If you put an FPS player in this game, they'll die of boredom before they fire their first shot.  It's a different game, where preparation really really matters, and some people just want to jump in and start shooting.  Those people are going to review EVE very poorly.

just like your dead meat f1 monkey playstyle

is there or is there  not a rorq tackled?!

2 FUCKING DICTORS!

Ping goes out for Machs in staging, convo ensues:

Spodbrain: "Anybody got any machariels for sale in our staging?"

Me: "If you need a Mach for this op, let me know and I'll let you borrow one."
---
Spodbrain: "Thanks, but I can't fly them."
---
WTF

You're not alone.

hahahaha JUST ADAPT haha meta is changing hahaha I could crush your elite dvd microgang (lmao) with my 2 titans and I have 7 more in build already xddddd pvp alliances are just relics you need to get off your high horse

And start a multi dollar media empire

Dude I second this! WBVB is super fun and a great Corp for content. I will follow their greatest FC and leader, Swift Isu, into Valhalla daily if he asks.

My cyno hounds and tackle astero’s are ready.

Stitch is by far my preferred EVE youtuber for the videos he uploads. Watching him blap people makes me want to leave the rorqual and look for fights every time, using his fittings with some changes to adjust them for what I like/want, and of course, my own fits. Thank you to both of you for this work!

And that's when I go "fuuuuuck this" and go find a fight
---
High praise indeed, thank you very much!
---
My pleasure man, glad you enjoyed!
---
If you like frigs around that try flying lowzec faction warfare space. Novice and small plexes. Can be great fun. If you really like it their are a lot of solid small/medium pirste or fac warfare corps
---
420noscope!!
---
This is a rich man's game, always was and always will be. If you can't afford at least 6 Amazon prime memberships a year, you can't afford Eve. 
---
Okay. That's sort of what i was guessing. Thank you!
---
As I have stated in my other reply - WH life is really hard if you do it solo. I started with multiboxing 2 accs to run C3s, I am tripleboxing to farm C4s. People use dual-Rattles/Nestors to farm C4s. I don't like idea of using 1b+ ships there, the risk is just not worth it. So I fly cheap Domis, works great for me so far.  
---
You can see on ZKB what people lose in C4s, that's crazy. People are flying 4b+ Golems, I assume that's how solo farming C4 looks like and I don't like it :)

Almost a week and no shits given by ccp.  :(

This looks pretty impressive 'till you realize every phase is just "post about a lowsec gate to stain".

Then it's really impressive.

Alright, now I feel bad for my meme answer. He did in fact gain prominence by being the main FC for Nulli, but that alliance disbanded years ago and he's now one of the main FCs for TEST.

---
There's two important aspects to consider in regards to eve and "pay to win"  
---
The first is how plex is bought and sold,  and how skill injectors are produced.   
---
The second is that when you use your isk to but an awesome ship hull and it gets blown up,  you don't respawn during in that ship you "paid" for, its just gone.   
---
I think those are important distinctions anyway versus other games.
---
Thanks man, how are things over in Tri?
---
My point exactly. As soon as I get back to playing I'm heading back to WH lolol
---
Eventually, you come to terms with ships as expendable equipment and blowing stuff. Win or lose you get into fun fights that escalate to major battles. The solution is to out earn your losses and to have more ships ready to go.
---
I think you should just make the T2 ammo stand out more. Outline them in a bolder color to differentiate from all the info that's specifically T1. T1 is so similar to each other anyway, "-x% stat 1, +y% stat 2", its not that important to see all the details. You get the picture just by seeing them arranged on a line. Meanwhile I have to hunt to figure out where you even put the T2 info.
---
Thanks, and i encourage all modifications to my fits that help your end goals.

How do you figure?  It is one small table with a few columns that clearly articulate name, damage and modifiers, and is sorted in a way that is useful then color-coded to show the highs and lows for each column.

Indeed, like 2 weeks ago I killed a Firetail in my bait celestis before his gang killed me. But the bastard shot something to get gate agro just before he died, so there was no killmail at all.
---
Oh man that first one has so many options. My favorite is always: "I need 2 more basies to take this fight, comeon someone needs to switch over"
---
It happens in lowsec too.
---
So is this an omission by CCP that I can now ISbox hulks?
---
I feel always sad but I'm just too stingy for more accounts :/
---
1. Dope infographics
---
2. A nice complementing infographic would be the typical damage hole on cookie-cutter fits.
---
I know it would be far from perfect, but when I was a noob I charted out all the typical holes for frigates so when I saw stuff on dscan in fw I knew what ammo and if I could even fight it.

Once you issue a pap we will upvote. Look at NGSA that worked.

CSM8 spent our full term building one of these for our use which was on -- surprise! -- a spreadsheet. It was like the world's worst logic puzzle, though. Every time we linked someone's RL first name, their CCP name, the dev team they were on, and their responsibility, they'd be transferred.
---
I can't tell you the number of times we'd be told something like "Grimmi is working on this" and we'd immediately reply "What's Grimmi's dev name? What team is he on?" in an attempt to keep our spreadsheet up to date or add info to it... ;-)

Reddit is a communication medium, not a viral YouTube video. Stop being weird and stop puffing up your own importance. It's a communication platform, and a pretty poor one at that. Reddit is too fractured and difficult to read to make any rational comparison to facebook and YouTube.

I understand who you are, but it really changes nothing, it doesn't make r/eve any more or less of steaming shitheap dude, and you know it.

I too have noticed that when some clueless dude asks for help during fleet formup he frequently cannot be helped.
---
A: Can I bring my inty???"  
---
B: No, bring a doctrine ship.  
---
A: I can't fly any of them.    
---
B: Then bring a tackle or ewar frigate.  
---
A: What do you mean?  
---
B: They hand them out for free in that newbie channel.  
---
A: Will you give me one?  
---
B: I don't have one.  
---
A: Can you link it for me?  
---
B: Check your welcome mail!

A: Uhh I took a three year break and I don't have it any more.

B: Fuck off!

Much like highsec miners
---
I'm gonna judge you bae. If you're anom ratting with a Rattlesnake you're doing it wrong. Leave a half-billion ISK hull + fittings sitting at warpable beacons for extended periods and you'll get killed by blops hunters. You also don't use rapid missiles for PvE. Stick to the fits your alliance gives you. If you want to make money with a rattlesnake buy and run other peoples' escalations.

Nope there are like 2-3 StainGuy corpses atm.

yeah if you sit 2k out with your fighers on outoattack, you can pretty much afk all fight
---
He blamed us for letting him yell at the deaf guy.
---
I understand why you think my comment may be silly, but Eve as a sandbox only exists for people with either a lot of time, or a lot of money. If you truly value your time in this game, you pay more than $30 a month. 
---
"It's more pay-to-get-more-stuff-blown-up."

It's also pay to blow stuff up. 
---
With 1 pilot having multiple scouts in multiple systems, the chance of a successful gank increases drastically.
---
I have multiple accounts in this game. I"m not afraid to call a spade a spade. The game IS p2w if you define 'winning' as enjoyment.
---
Half of that example can be avoided by telling him to bring the inty after he says he cant fly doctrine. So I'm putting that one on you
---
1DQ1-A fits this bill. What do you mean, you don't have a krab alt in GSF?

Im glad you find fixes to 8 year old bugs exciting.

Well you can set up a bubble and cyno inhib too tho...

Not if you make most of the words 'and then'

There is one keepstar in Stain in this manner.

A very annoying timing issue at loading wormholes after server start. It tried to remove expired wormholes, but if this happened exactly at the time, when the system of one end of the wormhole was being loaded, we delayed this expiry indefinitely. But: We only delayed the expiry of one end, which enabled the possibility of the wormhole restarting with a new destination. 
---
As far as I could see it is quite likely that this bug existed already since wormholes were implemented originally for Apocrypha.
---
Matterall tried this in low-sec. Goons said take it down or we will blow it up. 
---
Null sec it wouldn't work either. The sov holder would likely recruit someone or take it out themselves 
---
Mark feeds again
---
The rest of the game is like that too, it doesn't hold your hand. Some like it, some don't 
---
also major buffs to concord response time back in 08 or 09, something like that
---
NPC null is a thing tho
---
Oh look it's the weird maths where an even chance to spawn in any system is apparently 'unfair'. And strangely the 'fix' he's proposing would bring a big benefit to the group holding Blood Raider space. Who's that again?
---
Asking them to only spawn in NPC null, thereby taking whole sections of space where coincidentally you aren't active out of play, just makes it even more transparent what you're trying to do.
---
There is a kind of valid point about systems in jump range, but there being geographic variation across the cluster isn't a bad thing. If you want more shots at this you can take space in the 'good' parts of the map.
---
why would you want that in the first place?
---
There a lot of neutral jump freighter coming and going everyday.
---
No, go away.

The active subreddit for the game thinks it's shit and should never have been made if you read most of the posts here.

My goals are Being able to fly most T2 caldari cruises/destroyers/Battleships.   Learn planetary interaction which im doing with help from a friend  getting some more pvp  experience and create An alliance with my friends and allies

basically every time CCP makes ganking harder, the gankers just become more organized to compensate.
---
concord arrives faster? ganking becomes a group activity instead of solo mad bombers.    
---
insurance gets removed? guys start scanning and killing for profit to pay for their expenses.

hp of freighters buffed? invent new methods like hyperdunking to kill more efficiently.

Pheobe Freeport Republic, gone but not forgotten.

Short answer to is the game still relevent is yes, the long answer is the game is fun only if you have a goal to work towards and a good group to play with. I would suggest starting an alpha account and trying a bunch of different stuff first. Join one of the newbie corps like karma fleet, brave newbies, or pandemic horde. They can provide a lot of guidance on various parts of the game and help off set a lot of learning with free t1 frigates fit for new low sp players and alphas. If you enjoy pvp you can join the specter fleet npsi or bombers bar (requires omega for cloaks) and fly with them. Once you find a goal the game is a hobby so allot as much as you feel comfortable with for it. Once you complete a goal move on to a new one or give the game a break. Best way is try the game for a month with one of the starter packs since for $14 you get a month of game time, some plex for starting capital or to save for later and these frequently go on sale on Amazon humble and steam.
---
Perhaps we should change the name shit stain?
---
So what's this GDP ?  Havent seen or heard from them.   A police Force ? Also enforcing fake laws made by the bank ?

That's why i left a few months ago. Im happy where i am now.

Each citadel have ID ... including those sotiyos.

Fuck Francis  im happy i left months ago i was so done with that Guy.

Have my upvote too funny

Economic opportunities, mostly. Imagine a nullsec port where it was generally safe to trade; maybe as safe as Jita.  
---
Granted, that's not very safe, but imagine a Jita in -1.0 space.
---
Normally you'd be right. What I am is overly optimistic.
---
...huh. weird then
---
If I have an Omega account can I also have a free non Omega account? And play then at the same time 🤔
---
Man why eveybody crying about this every damn day of the week
---
part of the honor system would be not using it for any war purposes, once it's used by one side it's no longer neutral
---
I never heard of em probably because i live under a rock most of these days. But what's their story?
---
Mind sharing how you know what's going to drop to determine if it's worth showing up?
---
You know, there are these things called citadels that completely bypass the timers right?
---
Lol. Moving for content lmfao.
---
Those are just jf alts for Goons, every major ns alliance has them. 
---
No 
---
I hate em i only jumpclone to jita to buy skillbooks inject them log off and a day later i jump back. It sucks i Cant go back instantly. Im a Guy i stick in 3 systems and never come out without a group or fleet because apparently every time i go out solo i die. Doesnt matter where when i always die. That's why i Cant sell in jita. But got tons of stuff.  
---
Have you by accident tracked where did you put missing gates from Stain to lowsec?           
---
That's pretty sad, honestly. It was more interesting when they tried to accomplish something on their own - then they became Goon pets to a degree, and now they will become another weak group in Legacy.
---
??? redesign? 
---
But if the person is struggling with the concept of fleet doctrines I don't think anyone can be bothered to get them into the absolute optimal thing. There is a certain point past which you say "you know what, if it has a warp drive your good, just don't broadcast for reps."
---
Your Move
---
I feel like the level of humour with all these, 'our alliance is folding - made you believe it', threads was boring at the beginning. It's been reproduced so many times though, it's not even slightly amusing any more.  Kind of like the jokes your 10 year old plays.
---
Shameless
---
Who replies to a post that's over 24h old??? really??
---
One of the GalMil alliances which got buff and took over part of Cloud Ring. Picked a side in the war between Legacy/Imps and Gotg/Panfam, havent done super well afterwards.
---
It's easier said then done though. I've tried several times. 
---
Really happy to see so many minor QOL fixes taken care of. This patch removes my personal 2 most annoying bugs, and a whole lot of other ones. Great work!
---
Should be changed to an 8hr max with the cooldown from there.  Probably rescale that reduction skill too it eliminate alright.
---
This would let me play both EU and USTZ without having to choose.
---
All those positive reviews - people who enjoy these large MMO sandbox style games like eve with brutal death mechanics
---
Negative reviews - aren’t into this kind of game, or got their blingy little ship blow up and they are seeping their salty tears into reviews
