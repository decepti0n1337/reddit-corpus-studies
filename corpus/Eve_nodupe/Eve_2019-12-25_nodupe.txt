It makes no sense!
---
---
---
thanks!
---
Pretty simple way is to just extend "tiericide" for meta modules to faction modules as well. Have a "baseline" faction module with better stats than Tech 2, then apply the same restrained/scoped/compact/enduring/whatever modifiers to the faction modules as well.
---
Statistics disagrees with you.
---

---
Otherwise you could just go buy that many tickets in every raffle and win an endless amount of stuff!!!
---
Right????
---
&gt; "Anything that doesn't perfectly align with my world view is false!"
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Nice reasoning buddy. You've done nothing but strawman and act like a total assclown.
---
&gt; You want to keep waving away the insanely obvious issues with his death by screaming "mUH magIC AsSaSSin".
---
&gt; As someone else already pointed out, far far FAR greater conspiracies have been proven true.
---
&gt; Keep being such an ignorant asshole.
---
What absolutely insane logic. Someone conspired once, somewhere, therefore all conspiracies I come up with are true!
---
Well I guess he was assassinated by the lizard people, huh? No, no, wait. He IS a lizard person. And the body that was found was actually his shed skin.
---
Ah yes, "far far FAR greater conspiracies have been proven true" so we must be on the right track!
---
This is definitely the content we are looking for!  Thank you!
---
&gt;I don't know you, you don't know me
---
Bold assumption, Steven.
---
Then you'll likely just end up where we are now. People always prioritize for the stat that the module is supposed to improve. 
---
Gist/Domination shield, armor faction hardeners are rarely used already. Faction point, scram and web prices are directly related to range and strength. Thukker is more fitting friendly, but the only module that is really used are the cap batteries.
---
No, it's a real gooby.
---
Regardless, it solved the issue completely and instantly. My friend also had the same issue and as a last resort after exhausting all other options CCP suggested that he try using another router and it instantly fixed it for him too.
---
There are 3 sizes and 4 types for deadspace modules.
---
 
---
Frigate size modules: corpii (blood raiders), centii (sansha), coreli (serpentis), gistii (angel), pithi (guristas).
---
Cruiser size modules: corpum, centum, corelum, gistum, pithum. (Note that all the juicy adaptive eanm's and invulns are here)
---
Battleship size modules: corpus, centus, core, gist, pith.
---
1/10 drops frig size c-types
---
2/10 drops frig size b-types
---
3/10 drops frig size a-types
---
4/10 drops cruiser size c-types
---
5/10 drops cruiser size b-types
---
6/10 drops cruiser size a-types
---
7/10 drops battleship size c-types
---
8/10 drops battleship size b-types
---
9/10 doesn't really exist but faction fleet staging point escalation drops battleship size a-types
---
10/10 drops battleship size x-types
---
Every site that drops frig size modules has a chance to drop faction frig bpc. Cruiser size module sites have a chance to drop faction cruiser bpc. Battleship size module sites can drop faction battleship bpc.
---
1-4 spawn in hisec. 5 can escalate in hisec.
---
1-6 spawn in lowsec.
---
6-10 spawn in null.
---
All deadspace drops can be accompanied by faction loot. 
---
Guaranteed loot from deadspace sites is only overseet box. Max  number of deadspace loot in one overseer wreck i've seen is 4 different deadspace modules.
---
Now go to jita or 3rd party site, see what deadspace loot is expensive, refer to my comment to see where it drops, and google the site to see where it can be scanned down or what it escalates from. Good luck!
---
Why not in a power block or scared of null
---
You're the one that started this whole thing with "there is absolutely no way, ever, never ever, that Epstein didn't kill himself and anyone saying so is a moron".
---
You started this entire thing by putting up a field of strawmen and acting like an assclown.
---
Honk Honk mothafucka
---
What sistem
---
Good
---
Those have the annoying X in the middle forcing you to use a 2x2 to hold them don’t they? Have you tried offsetting them at an angle so that they’re only held on by one stud at the top, you could maybe make the arms more compact that way, and still fit 3 without it looking off. As it is I think it looks pretty awesome still.
---
True that!
---
Just no.
---
I used to be in PIRAT and lemme tell you this hits home sooooo much harder when you've been on the inside XD
---
Well most stations have agents so you can just keep on doing missions as you skill up and get into more ships.
---
No?
---
This is obviously a (poor) deep fake attempt.
---
Merry Christmas everyone!
---
are you having a stroke?
---
Imagine getting salty on your own bragging thread lmao
---
What was the point of this thread?
---
no
---
Green skinned hurricanes seem appropriate. Or perhaps the right arrangement of Nightmares.
---
The nightmares go before xmas
---
Looking at the screen you are talking about, the actual wording there is "Base Broker Fee". Presumably that's the fee before anything else is applied to it.
---
and the new ships' colorful coating aurora astronomical!! wonderful color

Fk

Fw Fox is easy imo. When it was released it made sense to have the standings and at penalty. But now what fw needs is people flying in space. First Remove the silly requirement of having to be in a special fw Corp. This will bring the null sec crew into fw space. Then remove the “your whole Corp is at war” silliness. This will make alt Corp able to join fw without affecting their ability to do support for mains. Lastly remove the dumb standing penalty for a neutral fighting in a plex there are lots of players who do not want to mess up thier standings but want a outlet for fair pvp.
---
Yes
---
Dumbass
---
Give null sec a outlet for fair solo pvp. Add plexes as part of adms.
---
e
---
&gt;i uh... am not sure why people are downvoting me
---
We're downvoting you because, given the current evidence available to us, this appears to be a paranoid fantasy more than a genuine concern.
---
Fuck Christmas, it's the worst day of the year.
---
It's not going to happen.
---
could you do a photo of all the pieces used, separated?  Not asking for full instructions, but I like to know all the pieces to the puzzle before I start.
---
&amp;#x200B;

Does CCP state that at any point? Do they even claim that it's random anywhere? CCP can do whatever they want in the background.
---
Like a wh?
---
Not anymore
---
They took that out due to incompatibility from the used legacy code with the newer engine a few years back (at least that's how I understood it, no programming experience what so ever)
---
Ummm try again
---
r/echoes
---
Unless you fly T3 ships.
---
&gt;A bunch of burly Icelanders bust through your door and beat you with frozen cod.
---
**ÉG ER AÐ KOMANDI FYR ÞÚ**
---
It's in the game
---
which one is this?
---
A few bil it'd be a lot more if any of these were fully researched. Still that's some good fuckin ratting tick
---
Ok, I remember something about a decently researched bpo. That's worth more than a titan. And a titan's worth of materials from Richie/ alliance? - the few billion worth of trash you were too lazy to move.
---
Bump omens/ stabbers were nasty, over 20km/s. Luckily we don't do station/ pos games any more.
---
(farting noises)
---
I would never get rid of stuff like that
---
Bring it to Jita 4/4, and store it, if necessary on a different account.
---
Chances are very small, that you will sell anything for a profit.
---
Were you using the abyssal filaments? Those have restrictions on what and how many ships get transported.
---
The holiday one.
---
Different reply, different topic
---
You can always go to one of the bigger null blocs, although their politics are often debatable, their space is likely safer than HS, if you pay attention to the 2 rules there are: pay attention to the Intel channel and local/ descant
---
Next question is:
---
How long have you been playing, how many SP are on your Toon. Depending on that, you could also join one of the smaller Null alliances like Triggerhappy (I’m in there). Then, if you have alt accounts with maybe a cyborg charm or tackle alts, you can consider even more NS alliances/ Corporations.
---
I have done that, and I lived
---
.... for a certain amount of time
---
I had that, too
---
Check you router for a firmware update, and check what port you are using to connect to the game in the prefs.ini
---
[Faction is better](https://i.imgur.com/vehGQui.png)
---
I mean, see how you look if you make it to 98 :D
---
Congratulations! I’m only at lvl 251 so still a long way to go for me before my own Marshal bpc.
---
I think I saw while back an app or website that could do that
---
Jesus - i came in here to get context on the condor catch, shouldn't be surprised.
---
You will go nuts eventually :)))
---
You can solo. You need to be &gt;1000 km from structures, stargates, and wormholes. Just warp to a planet and activate.
---
I SD the cyno this time, I didn't have any alt ready to defend and didn't want to give a "stupid" killmail I guess. There's no sign of cap activity on my killboards yet
---
I'm with my boy Trottel
---
Nope because you can still yeet kikis through frig holes and kill leshaks east
---
It's Fraternity that's literally all they do
---
Maybe pandemic hoard
---
Always some edgelord has to hop on reddit to show everyone how displeased they are with the ops post.
---
Because people don't understand math. Including you.
---
Looking forward to the Lego animated short in a few years
---
People complain about boring PvE, but the truth is I only spend about 5% of my time ratting, and the rest is dedicated to losing semi-blingy ships in glorious combat. I don't mind at all.
---
The in-game tool is garbage. Go to the recruitment subforum, or use /r/evejobs.
---
If you replaced the 2x2 roud tiles with 2x2 round jumper plates, you could add levers to represent the mining turrets
---
Gotcha, i still prefer t2 over the faction, I run a cookie cutter shield kiki and it’s got the fitting to use t2, better optimal is nice but kiki doesn’t super need it imo, I typically dive in with mystic loaded instead of meson. I just prefer the dmg increase
---
Most excellent!
---
Im up in venal launching attacks to the surroundings. Casual tho!
---
Thanks for that, Merry Christmas.
---
Thank you, I'll go check that out. And Merry Christmas!
---
Yeah. It's difference in preference. I used to fly a kite Kiki and having the extra range was nice to stay further away.
---
How is TAPI equal to calling sb names. Your still as retarded as you used to be lmbo. And yes i remember you dimwitt xD
---
Wow thats very mean my dude :(
---
exactly. I have 3 toons currently until october next year, with that 15% today, guess i can extend that a bit :)
---
The notification stopped at "upgraded leg".
---
Honestly, still accurate
---
hes my corp mate and trolling. dont bite the bait
---
I was in jita. And we had a long romantic relationship. We talked hours on end about all the dead corpses in your hanger. I couldnt help myself but be engaged. Please come back to me.
---
I think shitty low-effort memes only work when they really say something cutting or insightful, then: the lower the effort, the better.
---
The ones from some porno or movie with logos just pasted all over faces don't say anything except "I'm a nerd trying to be funny, that's it".
---
can YOU not
---
go join a small wormhole corp and have fun
---
Where is the link for the actual deal? I can't find it
---
Yep. About 4.5/5bil each. No way in hell I'm paying that much for a re-texture job. The others for the ship range from say 75m-1.5b, which is acceptable, but c'mon, 5billion for a ship texture?
---
I'm kind of surprised (and a bit disappointed) that CCP isn't opting for the same system that STO is using-- IE allowing us to print any ship, with any skin. 
---
Like, this are nice ships, but other than the Oracle, they're not really ships I'm interested in, unfortunately.
---
The current ones will expire January 14th.
---
Whether they'll come back is yet to be seen.
