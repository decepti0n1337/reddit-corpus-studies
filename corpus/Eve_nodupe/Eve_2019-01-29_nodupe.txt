Jump Freighters?

&gt; undocking to move items
---
the particular items traded in Perimiter, PLEX, you're doing it wrong if you ever undock with them.
---
Which is why they attacked our fort in Oijanen instead of showing up for the armor timer, I guess.
---
Horde was taking in even more money than we are currently from highsec, our market tax rate is 60% of theirs and we don’t have full control of he market. Despite this, they have worse benefits in every way. Their SRP is terrible on the rare fleets they actually get SRP, their free ships and skillbooks are a joke, and they nationalize their best moons. The alliance provides basically nothing to its members, it’s among the worst in EVE, despite having some of the best income for a while.

"you're risk averse" - a bunch of guys with zero career solo kills who only pvp when an FC is telling them how to, 2019
---
Reality is that the games player base has complained loudly about bots for 10 years so has the CSM and CCP has given exactly ZERO fucks. One more guy doing the same thing we have done for a decade will make no difference in the short term and in the long term he will burn out and walk away like he always does.

There are multiple signs for an anom nerf. I hope for an anom nerf. I guess anom nerf. Fuck me for explicitly guessing. Forgot guessing was forbidden by the mega empire reddit warrior type.
---
There is a guy who does something similar in a supercarrier who hit the cap recently (999, the hull can't display more)
---
What I said, unless I somehow forgot to mention it, is that of course you'll see the rest of the coalition together with Horde when TEST has put up staging Fortizars and stuff like that on Geminate's border. Some might call it batphoning, but I'd imagine it's pretty normal for a coalition to respond that way.
---
Just like how the rest of Legacy did the same for TEST's HS Keepstar, that's what I meant. It's just lame that goons jump on too, as if that was needed.
---
If you’re going to accuse us of violating EULA and NDA, at least have the decency to have some facts before you do so.

DAE NOTICE FRANK TRIED DRAGGING STRONT INTO HIS DD?!
---
Everyone THINKS they know and that's the problem. I have been in a fleet with 10 rorqs, and watched a boosher get called out one jump out, heard all the different rorq pilots say in coms they are pulling drones. Then watched the boosher come into system immediately scan catch the excavs for one split second on scan while they are still in space but already being recalled, then they scan a second time and immediately accuse 10 different people of being 1 person multi-boxing using broadcast to recall. That's why I want to see video proof, because anything less can just be someone angry people were aware of their presence and taking precautions to not get ganked and the person hunting has no way of knowing which thing happened.

I don't know, but I want to declare war on this and go to town....

---
Perimeter recently has had content every couple of days with PanFam repeatedly reinforcing the TTT and TEST attacking dozens of Horde-aligned Azbels which they're using to try to undercut the Keepstar.
---
The disparate locations of r64 moons is definitely a major difference though. I touched on that in the article but maybe not enough.

i thought Snuff was an independent alliance that dont need no goon overlord now? Or was that just a temporary thing just long enough to make FEDUP join legacy?

nice !

I was sieged you moron. Learn how this game works 
---
This was already debunked a few weeks ago. Horde SRP's nearly every fleet in addition to helping the purchase of capitals and super capitals. Everything you just stated is false, on every account. Once again, the narrative you're regurgitating shows that you literally don't know what you're talking about.
---
I'd seige it.
---
I'm behind 12 proxies, you'll never get me

when i read that yesterday I was wondering initially if that failed WH op was spies activating MWD while jumping the hole as a strategic effort. but now i'm wondering if it was goon miners activating MWD to get an easy Pap link.

at least 30% of the Esoteria if not close to half are mostly empty most of the time. people just like to cramp into that few system

Irony overload.
---
CODE. can choose to invalidate their "licenses" at a whim, citing obscure rule "infractions", or being AFK, etc.
---
It is far easier just mining in a system that CODE. don't bother with.  There are a LOT of such systems.
---
Goon FCs are not entosising Period Basis.

If shit hits the fan you can be sure that they are as blue as goons are to test.

Same as nc. And horde

---
You would be wrong in your assumptions.
---
This venture has zero to do with an anom nerf.  You are talking out of your ass now.

But your premise as to what will be/is currently happening in Period Basis is based upon a false notion that you have.
---
Neither
---
Yes :)
---
I'm having a look over your link to Signal Cartel now. I keep seeing some groups offering a "buy-back program" but without explaining what a buy back program actually means. Does that mean you sell members of your corp stuff with the right to buy it back at a later time?

So.

Where did the Isk go?

By an metric, Legacy is larger than Panfam on it's owns. Goons are by any metric at least twice the size of Panfam and combined by an metric the two are at least three times the size of Panfam.

Maybe before dropping your dread on a solo frigate to "bait an escalation", you should maybe know who you are supposedly baiting?

see my post history for a failed coverup and goons trying to excuse their leadership doxxing last year
---
nice
---
Not at all. They were fun to harass during the last war. My corp currently has a NIP with them... however I am not entirely sure it is still "technically" valid as I believe their activities with SkillU could be an act of aggression. But I am just an F1 monkey, not leadership, so I am not privy to all the diplomatic stuff. I just liked pewpewing cute little pandas.

Can confirm that Jamaicamans lot are good folk and fun to hang on comms with.

---
Clementine for linux
---
Well does it really make a difference once you go beyond the structure of the alliance what you define other participants whether they are called coalition, mercenaries, frenemies, third parties etc?
---
Brilliant
---
Buy-back programs make it easier for members to sell stuff they harvest or produce, as the corp buys whatever it is.
---
However, there can be a cost for the convenience; that can vary greatly.
---
Some buy-back programs are designed to help build a corp's wallet, to pay for things like structures, ship reimbursement programs, or even system rentals.
---
Mining buy-back programs generally buy all ore that is mined, with the exception of ore that is mined during ops organized to pad the corp's coffers.
---
Example 1:
---
As a CEO, my corp had a buy-back program for Sleeper (w-space) loot.  All loot on corp ops went to the corp, until the corp wallet hit a magic number (2.5b per member).  After that, all loot was distributed among participants, with the option of the corp buying it all, and just giving everyone ISK.  The ISK was used for operating costs, and ship corp-op reimbursement, and we did reimburse many ships, including capitals.
---
Example 2:
---
I was involved in running a PI buy-back program for my then corp.
---
We paid members Jita buy-order prices for their PI materials (we bought all P1).  Since we were about 20 light-years from Jita (3 jumps in a jump freighter, at a then cost of about 90m per trip), it was a no-brainer for corp members to sell to the buy-back program rather than trying to sell it elsewhere themselves.
---
Get drunk and sing shitty songs.
---
&gt; If you’re going to accuse us of violating EULA and NDA
---
Where?
---
You are all a little bit more brain dead today lol.
---
Yes. I was part of the fleets that recaptured Provi after Legacy kicked PL out. Lots of work. Spent several days doing almost 24/7 fleets of entosis work.
---
All I'm trying to point out is that the OPs claim that all KWG sov structures have already been destroyed is objectively false. Perhaps it's simply that he jumped the gun, and parts of them are still being worked on?
---
why was I created to only feel pain
---
you know the fort got reinforced right?
---
Did you even bother to look at dotlan in the past 2 years? Even after losing all of pure blind and fade, gotg has all of 2 full regions, plus half of another, darkness itself owning 34 systems.
---
Maybe they were simply *fed up* with that direction!
---
Damn nice
---
Again, we’re not talking about Legacy. This was a purely Test deployment, with only Test doing anything in Oijanen. PH then panicked and hid under papa PL’s skirts, and called in the NCPL super fleet to save them, so we opted to call in our allies as well, because at this point a 1v1 wasn’t happening. I am firmly in favor of a Test vs PH single combat fight, and I’d love to see that happen at some point, but unfortunately PH’s leadership is too cowardly to do so.
---
Be a newbro again. Try a little bit of everything and then join a player Corp that does what you enjoy doing most in-game. 
---
I mean, it's the only way the game doesn't turn \*\*100%\*\* into blue donut syndrome...
---
Leaking CSM information is a direct violation of the NDA and the EULA, which is why Noobman is currently banned. You stated that we had likely found something out from the CSM, which would be a clear violation of this policy, thus accusing us of breaking the NDA and EULA. All this despite not having basic facts.
---
Don’t write checks you can’t back up.
---
&gt;Sure, you can make a name for yourself pulling off some epic scam or grand heist but that takes some serious creativity now that so many have been done to death and so many of those exploits can be seen coming miles away
---
Absolutely. There doesn't seem much opportunity to pull of anything remarkably outrageous unless you have a willingness to invest considerable time.
---
&gt;Turn a one man industry biz that builds and sells vexors to newbs into a conglomerate that absorbs competing buybacks, holds a monopoly on cap building for your alliance, and attain so much industrial power that you effectively have a big corp's CEO by the balls and can influence military, defense, sov acquisition, etc.
---
There is one thing that bothers me about this though. Surely people have already achieved this state of  dominance and yet, from looking at the sov maps, I dont see much change other than a few name changes and the Goons rising from the ashes like a Phoenix. Unless there is some epic history to be made I would personally find it demotivating to put so much effort ( much of which of seems to be incredibly tedious ) into an end result which only provides border skirmishes and the occasional troll raid. 
---
For that reason I find some of these fringe groups, such as Wingspan and CODE to be far more appealing due to the simplicity of what they do, their innate humor, and the undoubted good fun they have doing something without the grind of huge time investment, and which can not be destroyed when some elephant decides to simply roll over.
---
To each their own though, in the meantime I am still waiting for CODE to pay me 10 billion ISK. Otherwise they will have to answer to the awesome power of my t1 frigate.
---
I agree with most of what you're saying but id rather do the stuff I have fun doing that also makes me the most loot. For me the fun is in the worth of the cans I'm finding. 
---
The plan right now is to replace it with a permanent landmark that serves the same purpose and can have cans anchored around it.
---
Design for the landmark is ongoing.
---
Upvote.  Awesome fan art, wouldn't mind seeing more

You gonna fight in high sec with them sure. Otherwise it's going to be cap blobs anywhere else. That genie is out of the bottle never to return
---
Horde does not SRP most fleets, this was not debunked at any point. To get SRP, a fleet requires director approval. I have not received SRP on most fleets my Horde alts go on. The most egregious case of this is the Ishtar stratop, in which Horde refused to SRP the pilots, despite the events not even being pilot error. It was only after a public shaming that they retroactively agreed to SRP that one specific fleet and only that fleet. Meanwhile in Test, we provide SRP on every single fleet from random shits and giggles roam all the way up to massive stratop supers dying everything is insane. The default assumption is SRP because you always get SRP, there’s no director approval.
---
And I can assure you, what little Horde has that they call subsidies, it’s got nothing on us, let alone goons. Not only is it tough enough to even start to get subsidies on your cap or super in Horde, but you also get diddly squat when doing so.
---
Not to mention that while Horde alliance leadership gets rich off the back of its members, the actual line members do not. They don’t get to mine R64s for profit, rorquals are basically impossible to operate as a lifestyle, and any kind of ratting tends to be forced to die or fit so many warp core stabs you aren’t making any money. 
---
The problem with Horde is so many people automatically join it with new players, and don’t realize that the hellish experience Horde provides is not emblematic of EVE as a whole. Other alliances are so much nicer to be in, but thousands of people quit before they get to experience that.

---
Whats your in game name?
---
Hmm. Okay. That's interesting. The reason for my concern is I have seen the impact of such blocs on other games. They get their toes in, they grow, they stick together remorselessly, they never give up, they keep growing. My experience has been they dont play the game to play the game. They play the game to make irl money, RWT or RMT, whatever it is called in Eve. I am pessimistic about CCP's willingness or ability to combat bots or batshit insane levels of multiboxing, particularly so now in view of Alpha accounts.

10-15% over jita. Sometimes a bit more for the bigger more specialised stuff. When I didn't have an entrance I had buy orders set up across the trade hubs. So (depending on the items) I'd actually make closer to 20-25%

&gt; Leaking CSM information is a direct violation of the NDA and the EULA
---
Alliances position themselves for upcoming changes all the time. Nobody can tell whether the said positioning is due to the leaked NDA info or not. This kind of thing happens all the time with many alliances. Whether it's supposed to happen or not is another discussion. But I did not blame TEST/Goons for anything.
---
Null and WH are the endgame.
---
Null has the advantage of local, so you know when to GTFO.
---
WH is probably more profitable, at the risk of being every exposed while doing the hacking game. The site guards are also probably tougher to clear depending on what class you are in.

How am I imagining things, this entire thread started with your accusation:
---
With both Goons and TEST taking over possible farm grounds  nearby, I would guess CSM has been told that another anom nerf is incoming. It would be nice if these alliances actually have to spread out a little.
---
You directly stated that you assume we’ve gotten info from the CSM, and are acting upon it, in a blatant violation of the NDA. If you don’t have any evidence, don’t make those kind of accusations.
---
Fax was only there to rep my Onyx, which didn't happen. There was no coordination between the Test guys on grid.
---
we have hundreds more. 
---
Since Red are a ratting alliance (as far as income goes), they don't actually need to mine anything. Due to their move to the East, which seems to have been done over the past year, they probably found living in two places a little too hard, so decided to move. They're still friends though, but probably want different content and have gone looking for it.

If it's not Slayer then it has no right being used as music.

Tanky ass T3C and ghost sites and sleeper caches, make this your goal 1, your 2nd goal, cloaky and tanky ass T3C and go hunt / kill explo bots and alike, both are excellent next stage goals for you. Man, if we got rid of like half of all the crappy sites in the game and just randomly replaced them with ghost sites, it would solve so many issues in the game, at least on this front.

Number of upvotes I gave you:

&gt; You directly stated that you assume we’ve gotten info from the CSM, and are acting upon it, 
---
That can still be true yet I might not be accusing anyone of anything. Instead, I was only pointing out that maybe an anom change is incoming. Frankly I don't give a fuck whether TEST/Goons committed this kind of NDA leak. I believe these leaks do regularly happen with nobody to prove them. So from my perspective if one alliance can do it why wouldn't others do it.
---
But tell me more about how you know what I meant better than me.
---
I think I gave the real reason above in my own post on here. It's nothing to do with we need more space and everything to do with what Red Alliance want, which is content. Period Basis is sleepy townville and is boring as all hell unless you love ratting or mining. Red Alliance are largely a pvp alliance since their inception. If you hadn't noticed, they have been moving across the map over the past year. Perhaps analyse what Red want rather than what Goons want? You may find the real answer when you answer that question.
---
The same place its going to from test, and where goons income goes and where everyone elses goes. Caches of stuff, srp, infrastructure and of course into Dooms ski trips, sappos subaru collection capqus katana collection and mittens rmt yacht.

It doesn’t matter that you don’t care. The people who matter in this scenario, CCP, do care, as shown by the recent Noobman actions. Your entire logic for an anom change coming is based on faulty evidence, and you’re claiming that evidence comes from an NDA violation. You’re not only sperging baselessly, you’re also accusing people of permabannable activity while doing so. Words matter, so pay attention when you write them.

Did you buy your friend a mining permit?

Ahhh okay. Thanks!

Friend has been playing for a week, Omega'd only 2 days ago.  Loves to mine so far.  This CODE guy thinks he's a bot or someone 'killing the game' when he's new and is exactly the type of person the game needs.

its not that rare but most of the time nothing  post worthy happens
---
         You continue to make things up so I'm unsure if you're open to facts or you're going to continue to ramble on. I've been apart of Horde since its creation, 2015, and I've seen the inner workings better than most throughout this time period. I've witnessed where Brave, TEST, and Karmafleet have failed their members time and time again and I've been apart of the solution to ensure it never happens to Horde.      
---
        I would also like to thank you for unknowingly complementing Horde by comparing its relatively new creation versus entities who've been around for twice as long. Nonetheless, comparing Horde to these groups isn't valid due to their core principles being polar opposites.     
---
        To start, Goonswarm doesn't just recruit new players but instead entire corporations and alliances to ensure they have peace. Instead of conquering their enemies, they recruit them.      
---
         Secondly, TAPI is a miniature Goonswarm who will sooner or later join the Imperium. TAPI also likes to recruit the low hanging fruit with minimal alt coverage. I wouldn't be surprised if The Imperium is pulling the strings right now for TAPI's overall direction.       
---
         Lastly, Pandemic Horde is nomadic by nature where it does not depend on space to live. Since you're apart of TAPI, imagine the opposite. Where you have to have space for money, Horde holds space for content. Gobbins has been quoted many of times over the years indicating that he does not care to lose space. Instead of funds being utilized to "defend everything", funds are leveraged for excursions, special projects, and rainy days. Don't believe that Horde is nomadic? Look no further than who created them.... the most nomadic alliance in Eve.          
---
      The next time your alliance runs out of money, watch how quick you blue The Imperium. Its real simple, new players join Horde to PVP. Other players join Tapi, Brave, and The Imperium to PVE.
---
forever.  If your friend likes the peaceful nature of mining, get him to null where you don't have to deal with Code and the ore is much better.

Code just likes to role play against all miners.  They particularly feed off the tears of players that feel that hi sec is completely safe.  
---
It's been years,  but I still love this schtick
---
This and wingspan
---
Then you're on your own
---
We don't care if you think we're blobbong. 
---
You're correct
---
This is one of CODE's standard things - salt mining emails. 
---
If newbies want to be 100% safe they can stay in the rookie system where people can't gank you.
---
  Eve is a PvP spaceship game. People buy ore, to build new ships, that have been blown up in PvP.
---
  If eve was actually suffering due to "trolls" it would have died 10+ years ago due to the combined effort of scamming, and ganking.
---
  TL;DR - Get good. Don't fly what you can't afford to lose. Ships are ammo, not items.
---
Thanks for that constructive feedback.
---
I'm not an Asshole, I'm a Hemorrhoid, I irritate Assholes. 
---
I don't know how alliances spend their ISK but if you do, contact me. It'd make a good article. ;)
---
In Karmafleet, it's 3 per quarter, which I find, is even easier. Netflix mining is great, btw. That said, salt mining with pvp whilst mining ore/ice on the other screen, is even more fun!
---
Eve is suffering because of the opposite, too many carebears who want to be safe all the time. I started playing this game BECAUSE I had to watch out for some dirty pirate who always wants to kill me.
---
Wingspan is great.  But when they killed me, I didn't get a receipt.  Pretty sad.
---
&gt;That can still be true yet I might not be accusing anyone of anything.
---
No, it actually can't.
---
You can't say: "people are acting on information that is protected by an NDA" without directly implying that someone violated that NDA.

We didn’t reinforce every structure in the game in one go so you guys *really* won the objective.

Nobody understands the struggle. AUTZ is essentially eve on hard mode.

Also to add: you can’t manual pilot ships that are over 6kms like snaked ceptors.

THIS sounds interesting.. Always assumed the WH sites with rats would tear you a knew one (especially in a C5..)

Literally just shoot the shit and rag on eachother, doesn't even have to be about the game.
---
If a nerf is announced...it would be awkward for those CSM reps.
---
It'll work fine. Just use 5 heavies and go afk
---
Since my fit can only dodge battleship attacks, I get hit by the rest of the ships, and the heavies do not engage frigates for a pretty decent time, they come and web me, so AFK is not possible for me.
---
....Or am I doing it in a weird way?

Please post update, i wanna see if its a wormhole straight to jays room

I have about 500b plus in BPOs and am averaging around 40b returns per month. Not great profit, but very AFK and lazy
---

Orbit at 50-60 and get some drone tracking bonuses. Also if the fit skills are not l5, get them there, specifically your tanking skills( prop and shield)
---
Get rid of the auto targeter 
---
Jump freighters.
---
Forgot to add language filter on RNG engine
---
because pre t3 changes ham/neut-legions were awesome for brawls..
---
in fact, pre t3 changes 5 different builds were used while nowadays it just comes down to lokis.. which is kinda sad

I simulate the cap with the auto targeter off.

Only with the AB, still can't get cap stable.

Every newb and their grandmother thinks about selling bp after researching. The smart ones look into what it actually involves and decide to station spin instead. But if you LIKE doing it, power to you.

Doing ORE stuff and selling those BP may still make money though.

Then get better skills? Or replace a rig with a CCC

A friend of mine thinks really high of you. Never been in a fleet under you but everyone says you have great skills. Then why did you not take actions against Marshy even when you know input broadcasting is still wrong? Because you are an icon and a lot of people respect you!

Now that people say it, I guess it's not that rare. Just docked up from exploring some Venal and saw a Tengu on dscan next to a data site, and he didn't even bat an eye when I warped in. I guess people can be nice, even when you could one-shot somebody 
---
First of all, thanks for the reply. So when have those changes been implemented? Some of the videos are just a couple of weeks, some others maybe 2-4 month old. 
---
I thought, it might be because it's an Amarr-Ship, so it benefits armor-doctrin, and due to the fact, the Gallente version is the worst of all t3c's they chose this one.
---
CCP Pointy Bits inspired me to create this. I hope he sees it.
---
More, more!
---
Love it man!

there are only a handful of frigs that web.  two i think per horde?  you can semi afk the fight since they are only in one of the waves?   sorry i'm a bit out of practice with the VNI in the dronelands.  
---
if you want, you can go full buffer shield regin.  ditch the nav comp and put another large extender.  ditch the field extenders and put on two more purgers.  drop a dda and put on another Power Diagnostic System II.  that will give you a ton of buffer and solid shield regin.  
---
Well done
---
Mah bro
---
drone BS only hit out to about 30 or so (i think).  if you orbit at 50-60 nothing hits you and your drones go limp. 
---
I did.  I received no message back.  Sad.
---
Drop the purger rig and add a CCC if you need to. Drop the drone nav and add omnidirectional tracking link with tracking speed script. Finally, replace an LSE II with an Invuln. You should still be cap stable. If you aren't, get those cap skills up.
---
Warp in at 30 and lock up all of the small stuff - go from smallest to largest. Set your orbit and go. 
---
Why CCP wont but something valuable in the sleeper data/relic sites? Seems kind of silly to take all the good loot out and put nothing back in.
---
Dear lord, what have we done...
---
In response to much feigned outrage and confusion regarding how Imperium and Legacy standings work, I have opted to publish this new pilots guide in an attempt to educate the slower of our northern friends.
---
Uhh isn't this supposed to be backwards?
---
I don't see the picture with the four Sansha ships tho.
---
I can look into this as we take customer satisfaction very seriously, please link or PM me the kill mail and I'll address it with the agent in question
---
No, it shows how Pilots from the Imperium and Legacy generally view each other with regards to their physical location in the cluster.

Uh bud, Imperium is definitely not red to themselves and Legacy, much less blue to panfam/thenorth.
---
Voltron would mean taking groups and making something better not worse...
---
Best bet I can think of is activate Asset Safety, wait the 20 days or whatever it is and you should be able to move it to an npc station in Khanid.
---
T3C changes happened a long while ago. But the reason you see Legions in Jspace is because the raw neut power they have is absurd. They become seriously dangerous to even capital level capacitor with just a handful of them.
---
Asset safety or join the locals. If you like them, stay. If not, you can extract or sell it.

Legions are rarely used anymore. They were traditionally used as a neuting platform, and then as a mainline dps ship as HK used it as a main doctrine for like 3 years. Most of w space copied this doctrine, or used Damnations. 
---
Then the t3 changes happened....
---
Why do I smell bait
---
Anyway, legions are dead. They were the go-to for years, after the t3c balance lokis are king. Legions exist sometimes as full-neut configurations, or blops, but for armour brawls it's weak. 
---
Obvious bait is obvious: [https://gyazo.com/22628db2fb222f56f9819b92e0264732](https://gyazo.com/22628db2fb222f56f9819b92e0264732)
---
Flown all of them except for Damavik and the new logi's, and they are in a good spot except for Damavik needing more help, and the muta-adaptive taking way too long to spool up to be a serious logi contender. Like any other ship, they are scary in numbers, but requiring cap and spool up time means they do have counters against them.   Vedmak could probably do with a tad more powergrid and Rodiva/Zarzmad having RR fitting reduction bonus back? 
---
Honestly, the best way to make money hauling is to join a big nullsec alliance, like Horde or Brave, and then ship in items with either a high turnover or a high markup from Jita, and sell them. 
---
If you’re just taking normal hauling contracts you’ll be competing against freighters and jump freighters, so you’d make terrible isk/hr. But if you combine it with trading you don’t need such a huge volume, and you can make quite a bit of money. 
---
I’d recommend using an instawarp Sunesis to move stuff, it can fit almost 1500m3 with t1 rigs. I can’t speak for any alliance but Horde, but the path from our staging to Jita is usually clear 
---
its disgusting how fast supers can log frigates, but nice bubble
---
Seems to me Ascendance might be just it. :)
---
Whats the difference between them and KarmaFleet?
---
&gt;if he's not flairbaiting
---
He's not, he's in HK. HK has one corp. It's not german specific, it has like 3 or 4 germans. 
---
If you're talking about HK renters, I can safely say there's only one of them that's not just total bear-ish nonsense like he mentioned. 
---
:thonking:
---
You cant work the isk/hour out on paper like that, are you accounting for the travel time for your excavs to drop the ore they mined off at your rorqual? The really big spod rocks can leave your drones up to 9km away sometimes, which results in about 18-20 seconds extra time per cycle. 
---
These things are what drops the isk to what you see.
---
P.S. Get t2 industrial core
---
Why? 
---
1. Telstra is shiiiiiiiite.
---
2. Everything crosses the pacific towards US and then crosses US, atlantic, before landing in the UK.
---
So the minimal roundtrip is around 300ms at light speed. Had a routers and a telco that cheaps out on peering and transit and well, you get 500+ ms to the DC before the eve lag.
---
I'd drop my D^^^r^^^e^^^a^^^d on that
---
P sure tikktokkcan solo your entire alliance m8
---
My favorite part was when Mrs. Dunk told you to eat the ding dong.
---
This looks cool, what shader setup are you using?
---
You sound like me when I first joined Brave (we are kinda neighbors!). I am the type that isn't quick to chat with strangers and that's how everyone felt to me. Eventually I got to know the core group and everything got a lot easier.
---
Here is what I did. Maybe it will help.
---
1) join all the comms. I'm in Brave so my comms are different than yours but it's all the same really. Get on them and listen and read. 
---
2) I assume you have an idea of what you like to do in Eve already so find a space job you can quietly do while you are getting used to the people in comms.  Go rat, go explore, go mine. Whatever it is just focus on the priority is still to learn how the corp works and not get comfortable quietly doing your own thing.
---
3) you are going to have to ask questions. Find the way that easier for you: typing in chat or just asking in voice comms. Brave has over 9000 members including afk peeps and alta but still A LOT of people and 80% of them just type a question when they need something answered then go back to doing their thing. You certainly don't have to be social but you do, eventually, have to not be nervous. 
---
Basically listen, read, learn while building up what it takes for you to feel comfortable chatting with corp mates.
---
Also, you may find that corp isn't a good fit for you. If so, I can recommend Brave if you want to stay on the good side and in the best alliance, haha.  But you'll have to overcome the same hurdles here too.
---
News just in: passive moon mining actually generates more combat content than what we have now.

What's so sad about it? Just the fact that combat now takes place in 0.9 rather than -0.9? There's money to be tapped into in highsec.

I actually laughed audibly. The fucking wormholer is retarded.

When I got out of the shower in the morning I saw that titan was tackled and russian wyverns had landed.  I then went to work and saw the killboards fill with supers throughout the day.  I won at eve shortly thereafter

You're so daft, it actually worries me how you get along in everyday life.

No, mining fleets can and do spawn independent of a sotiyo. I do not know where the hauler goes in that case, but in NPC delve it just goes to the station.
---
Ha well we'll see, when im drunkenly tackling the FC instead of a primary, it can get shouty ;p

I hope the damavik gets some love because I love flying frigates and really want to train in to it but it just doesn't seem worth it

The internal narrative in TEST was never an "invasion". From the get go it was "we won the defensive war, now we bring the fight to them.  TEST didnt bring all its super fleet with it, it even brought just the armor supers and none of the shield supers - which are the main doctrine of TEST.
---
It doesnt matter what the NCPL/Horde, or dumb 3rd parties call this. It's an attack in a controlled disadvantageous environment.

Why are they trash?

No bait here. I've started playing EVE in December 2017, and scince then, I've spend my time in null. Crabbin around, and got bored. Due to the fact my corp had no FC, there was like no corp-related pvp action. So, here i am, trying to figure out why things are the way they are, educating myself by watching videos, trying out stuff with a bunch of people, that are stupid enaugh to follow me and asking dumb questions on reddit ;)

A third reason might be that the fight is happening in Lowsec, and shooting pods loses you a chunk of sec status

yeah, what i'm saying is that dude didn't describe anything that's particularly unique to the german-speaking community, he just described the average mmo guild with traits that happen to transcend language
---
yes
---
With the kikimora you have to remember that it is a destroyer, and that it can be neutralized by a single long range or rapid light cruiser instantaneously. While some ships are strong, there are definite counters to all of them, and they are the only answer to the current capital meta that a lot of groups have.
---
I don't see why people don't like the damavik. Looking a zkill losses for them most are armor tanks and a couple shield tanks(seriously people?). It makes me wonder if people have forgotten speed tanking is a thing. I have a nice little fit that gets near interceptor speed with almost destroyer DPS when at full ramp.
---
A more mathematically precise way of defining the ramp up/down mechanic:
---
r_0 is the base rep amount
---
r_n is the rep amount on the n^th cycle
---
a_n is the raw hp actually applied on the n^th cycle
---
For all n &gt;= 0
---
r_(n+1) = (0.9 + 0.3 ( a_n / r_n )) * r_n
---
where r_(n+1) is additionally ceilinged by 1.5 r_0 and floored by 0.5 r_0

I've been on grid for a bit before drones were recalled. Several times, this month 2x rorqs 1x barges, idk who and in what exact systems, was more focused on catching something than to report people. It didn't happen in delve.

Did Reinforcement mechanics change? We just reffed a raitaru and it was low power and it made us shoot through the armor timer too with no ref time. Hull timer reffed but only for 11 hours? like da fuq

Also I am still banned from the r/eve discord who do I beg to get back in lol
---
Stain is not a problem. Remeber it has no low sec gate...
---
No clone vat bay, there's your problem.
---
It's just too tight, really. You cant plate them well so RR damaviks is wasted.
---
Also they dont actually have armor tank bonuses, just some hp and resists helping--but the slot layout lends itself fairly well to a shield tank so it actually makes sense.
---
The problem with the Damavik is that while it is ok fast, it is outclassed by a lot. Its one saving grace as a trig ship is it gets high max ramp dps, like a daredevil's amount. However this takes a long time to ramp up and you might not be realizing just how glacially slow this is when you talk about frigate fight timescale, and unlike the kiki the damavik doesn't have the range to poke and extend the engagement long enough.
---
Ummm...yeah....

Vedmak could definitely use a bit more power grid, the leshak, drecavak and kikimora are all definitely in good spots with their roles though. These ships have made killing rorquals and capitals much easier for small groups and have an interesting spot in the meta. However they are still very vulnerable to neut pressure, especially since an active leshak chugs 3200s like a fat man drinking a big gulp.
---
If I remember correctly the t3c changes happened in summer 2017. It really depends on what kind of videos are you looking at. Ganking ratters/explorers is a lot different than brawling of a wormhole. Also like all t3c, cloacks are used a lot in j-space. 
---
No specific support? That's why your daddy and legacy wardecced the entirety of panfam?
---
Im moving in! 
---
While that may be true now, that it can be executed by many 50km projectors, it is undoubtedly very strong and slippery. Also without recons it is hard to tackle, and often can escape. I think that it's probably not broken right now though undoubtedly very hard to deal with if flown well. Not including carrier drops which are their own can of worms.
---
That power goes way up, though, when you add Locus rigs into the equation. When you let the Kiki poke up to 600 dps with Mystic S from 80-100km, it becomes extremely cancerous and outranges or outdpses almost everything.
---
I don't think there should exist a destroyer that you need a blob or a capital drop to take on seriously.

I would like suggestions like: after you finish tutorial, do this... Or "Go and do this..." "Do this first...." Etc.

It is one of the more advanced methods of hauling due to the special characteristics of the ship.  So for it to be more suited to new players?  No.  Let them fly an Iteron.
---
They don’t have locus rigs currently though, do they have locus rigs on the test server?
---
They are planning to add them, it's been said that rigs and implants are in the works.
---
I'd link my fit but I'm at work and don't have it with me. But I'll give you an idea of what it is. T2 gun, 5mn YT-8 MWD, Scram, Web, 2 damage amp modules, overdrive injector, and I believe a Nuet and NOS. Rigs are the cap control ones. Nuet and NOS are meta'd, I believe the Scram and web are T2, possibly the overdrive injector also. 
---
With the MWD on if I remember correctly I get 3800+ m/s and the DPS with T2 Hobgoblins is in the 290s at full ramp. Oh and cap stable. I'm thinking that this would work as a fleet tackle(not initial, but secondary at least). 
---
Honestly, you should have advised your friend what is going to happen in this game. You should have also understood that 99% of players couldnt give less of a fuck about a person being new.

---
They were also planning to add shield slaves and look what happened with that unfortunately. It’s really too soon to tell if the ship will be cancerous when range rigs are added, also that means it will have to go without speed rigs which will make it a much slower, easier target to hit.
---
I agree. I believe if Germans speak English they need to only do so with that Hollywood German accent that you never actually hear in the wild unless you are at some Oktoberfest with blondes spilling out their breasts. 
---
Its not hard to get them. Find mission, go there in random ship, make him leave. Plant instalocking lachesis in the site. When he returns (and he will), kill him. 
---
I mean that's not too far off from the Garmur's ability to just orbit @ 50 km and tomato its way into solo kills because of superdank point range and LMLs letting it literally give no fucks about application against almost anything that it can actually catch.
---
The Garmur's only real limit is just that its lock range is super shitty and in-practice DPS does go down somewhat, but I'd honestly argue that the Kikimora- even if it could slap people at 80 km with Mystic- would be nowhere near as oppressive, as in an MWD fit you can just drop something like a T1 railgun Brutix and vaporize it because of the fat destroyer sig and no sig bonus.
---
In similar fashion the 10mn AB fit might be relatively "immune" to long-range cruiser weapons (very unlike the MWD fits and especially the fairly popular shield gank fit) but it's also fairly slow so something like a ramJag will be able to, well, ram it and then get it held down long enough for something else to kill it (and with an ADC said ramJag can definitely hold on for long enough).
---
I don't think it's necessarily bad that the Kikimora needs some (relatively) specialized tools to deal with, considering that the Garmur, and for nullsec bubbles in general, already restrict what is and is not possible in the meta.
---
I'm also reasonably certain that you can still shoot further with some of the T3Ds- perhaps not with quite as much DPS (assuming that you aren't going for a shield gank fit or something, since that's really the only way you can try to push 600 DPS with Mystic).
---
holy shit.  it happened.  peeps lost.  
---
let. it. go....
---
The kiki dors not lock that far natively, and has three midslots.
---
5mn, shield ex, sensor booster
---
nanos and entropic rads/dcu lows
---
That kind of fit is going to be vaporized by single cormorant before it can add anything meaningful to an engagement.
---
It's videos like this one: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgWntVdxnNA&amp;t](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgWntVdxnNA&amp;t)  Just some good fights. I'm not into those ganks on people who can't defend themself. If one seems unaware of his situation, and he seems to be a newbro, I shoot him, so he learns it was a stupid mistake, but I also reimburse the hull. The last thing I want is to make newbro's leave, cause they think all of us are shitty nerds, trying to kill the ones who can't yet defend. I enjoy brawls. Get a bunch of guys who are stupid enaugh to follow you, find some people that are willing to form for your little gang, and have a good fight. Thought about extending those activities to jspace, but as long as I don't understand why people do the stuff they do, I'll stick to the activities I am more familiar with. I'm totally aware of the fact, t3c's if they have the right submodule, can use cov ops and go nullified. 
---
In nullsec I constantly meet lokis and tengus, but I've only seen a single legion in null yet. In jspace I've come across more legions, than the combined amount of lokis and tengus I've seen in there. Maybe I've just had weird timings, and all the lokis and tengus were cloaked when I passed them, who knows? 
---
Thanks for sharing your knowledge

&gt;Light Entropic Disintegrator II deactivates as you have lost your lock on your target
---
&gt;I mean during my highsec noob phase where I was doing courier contracts I no doubt woulda tried some dangerous lowsec ones.
---
You've got this backwards. You don't try to use an *expensive* ship to run dangerous routes when you don't know what you're doing.
---
Me? I flew a cloak+mwd'ing tayra out to solitude fairly regularly for a while, made a bunch of isk hauling relatively small contracts out of both aridia and solitude. I didn't do it for the isk, I did it for the *experience* - specifically, I wanted to get chased all over the place so I could die a few times and get better.
---
Because doing stupid things in a 13 million ship+fit hauling 200 million collateral means later when I got into a 300 million ship hauling 4 billion collateral, I wouldn't *do* those stupid things that got me killed.

---
Got a faction miner from high sec belt once, sold it for 120m, it was like 3-4 years ago
---
It has the buffer to survive trading with a longbow corm, but yes, it does get threatened by anything with 100km projection like Nagas or Talos.
---
However other than that it really doesn't have a whole lot that can fight it. The reason why paper thin longbow corms work even mildly well right now is because 99% of subcaps simply cannot shoot that far, or catch up in time.
---
Kikis would be able to bring high dps into that equation. Fights involving them become less interesting and devolve into 100km dps contests or lose.
---
They halved the armor and shield HP in low power mode but made you shoot both like that, I guess it's less confusing to people. 
---
While T3Cs have had the overhaul to them (\~2017) and got quite a bit weaker, they still offer great platform for various builds. In 1v1 face-to-face PvP action a neuting Legion can hit quite heavy, especially to ships that rely on reps (the Tengu for example would most likely lose against a neuting Legion).
---
T3Cs in general are found alot in J-Space for being able to:
---
* tank alot of damage
---
* deal alot of damage (equivalent to those of some Battleships, especially for the Loki)
---
* have the option to fit cloaking (Hunters approve)
---
*  have Scanning bonuses with a certain Subsystem (especially when Solo hunting, fleets usualy have other ships for that job aswell)
---
The biggest drawbacks are mostly the cost and the loss of Skillpoints in a certain Subsystem skill level (average for costs on a loss: 600mil-1.2bil in ship &amp; fitting and \~4d of training back to full skills)

What fitt is used for the frigate Marlin on level 1 PvE and PvP in 2019? :)
---
Did you forget that the jackdaw exists? Or the zealot? There are a million ways to kill something with a large destroyer sig, t1 resists, that can project to 80. It still has poor initial dps with meson and is still relatively slow. Hell the fuckin jag can still probably tank it without issue.

Is there any field that's friendlier for alpha clones than the others? I've dabbled in PVP, PVE, exploration, and mining (gasp!), and found them all fairly enjoyable. I love the depth that EVE has to offer, but it all seems restricted to omega accounts. I've been spending hours on reddit and eveuni every day reading up on theory and stats, but it's all for things that are, as things stand right now, years down the road. To be fair, tempting alphas with great content is kind of CCP's entire business model, but I'd love to find a way to enjoy the game as an alpha clone—I just don't know what direction I should be moving in. 
---
For PVP, I'm leaning towards smaller engagements, rather than following the mega-fleet F1 monkey path, but haven't been able to find a corp that takes alphas, teaches PVP skills, and offers an SRP to help players along. It's a lot to ask, I know, but it seems like a bit of a catch-22 to be stuck without isk or skills trying to break into PVP. I know that a PVP habit is generally supposed to be funded by more profitable activities, but those seem to have similar issues.
---
Mining has pretty much no room for growth, since a single Venture can only be so efficient. I don't really have much more to say on that.
---
From what I've read (as well as what I've personally experienced), exploration is only really profitable in null-sec (read: Stain) and w-space, but every system I enter seems to have already been picked clean of any potential spoils, presumably by other hungry alphas. Flying a T1 frigate, I can't get anywhere near sleeper cans, and I've been told that an Astero will get jumped pretty much instantly if it doesn't have a cloak. There's also the issue that an Astero is definitely something that I can't afford to fly, seeing as how a skeleton fit for one would be around double my current wallet balance. 
---
As for PVE, I could conceivably belt rat my way to a VNI and skill myself up to the point where I could take it into profitable null-sec anomalies and then scrape together enough isk by next year to give myself some more options, but with no other activities to occupy my time, that honestly sounds like the most mind-numbingly boring activity possible.
---
Sorry if this question has been super long-winded and salty, I'm feeling pretty lost right now, but I don't want to leave this game! 
---
TLDR: Life as an alpha feels hard, what's my path into the big beautiful galaxy of New Eden?

You'll have high traversal. I wouldn't bring this on a cormorant or jackdaw fleet where you're having to cross 50-100km of space. 
---
I think tracking should be nerfed for all but the leshak amd frig, all drone bandwith and bay nerfed
---
Thanks for sharing. Didn't know about their neuting power before you guys told me. :)
---
You'd have high transversal in almost any frigate and, likewise, almost any frigate would outperform it. There's no point stacking damage and cap (for whatever reason) on what is meant to be fleet tackle.

It was just an idea I had. I didn't know if it would work or not.

---
&gt;Is there any field that's friendlier for alpha clones than the others?
---
Exploration would be it. Keep at it - it's not that systems are picked clean, it's more that the relic and data sites don't spawn in every system. Don't go to busy regions where big nullsec entities live. Don't go to high class wormholes, stick to C1-3. Use [anoik.is](http://anoik.is/) to figure out the class of your wormhole. 
---
Alternatively, salvage - it's a boring activity that relies on other people to make profit, but you can earn a lot of cash with it. Basically you move in with a newbie corp in nullsec, then follow their ratters around and salvage their sites after they complete them. 
---
&gt;but haven't been able to find a corp that takes alphas, teaches PVP skills, and offers an SRP to help players along.
---
Check out faction warfare corps, as well as /r/evejobs 
---
You will not be apolitical as a Goon. They don't allow it. You'd be better off joining a newbro alliance, or going solo if you're into adventure.
---
Normal anomalies, belt rats and DED rats will always be hostile towards you regardless of your standings. It's only the new diamond npc rats that take standings into account, the mining defense fleets and FOB rats

There are 3 agents you can use to start the epic arc. Check them out in the eve university website.

For the Angels one, as long as you have 3.0 to dominations, Amarr or Minmatar you can accept it.

For the guristas one, you need 3.0 to guristas, Caldari or gallente or the specific corp of the starter agent, so hopefully you have standings to at least one of those.

Thanks for the answer! A couple more questions:
---
How important is the location of the entry hole? I've been jumping in from holes in the systems around Jita (usually 5 or so jumps out), which might have a role in my trouble finding sites, but even 6 holes down it was still nothing but sleeper sites. I keep seeing reports of exploration netting 50m+ per hour, is that at all realistic? In my last 6 hours of explo, I made 4m off of a single data site!
---
Faction Warfare. Are there FW corps out there that offer LP buyback programs? I've seen some references to such programs from several years ago, but none from currently active corps. If it wasn't for the trouble with hauling and trading the faction items, I would absolutely be spending my time in plexes.
---
Hope in Mumble and you’ll see. 120 in alliance chat, 10 in Mumble.

&gt;In my last 6 hours of explo, I made 4m off of a single data site!
---
Oof, that's really rough. I'm no seasoned explorer, but there's a couple things you might be doing wrong. 
---
First of all, holes that lead directly to HS around Jita and Amarr will be mostly picked clean, so I would try venturing a little further than that. As for your journey through j-space, I can't know for sure, but I would assume you ended up on the "C5 highway". In short, most C5 holes are connected to other C5 holes, and those are pretty bad for exploration. Either avoid them by checking anoik.is, or limit yourself to only checking holes that lead directly to HS (these will be predominantly low-class). Having said that, not many newbros are willing to travel deeper than that, taking a chain like you did usually means getting to holes that weren't picked clean by other explorers.

Drones only have data sites. These are better than those of other factions, but because of the lack of any relic sites, Drone regions are still not great for explorations.

Like most EVE battles, it looked more interesting on BBC News than it actually was on-grid.

I am not unsympathetic to your plight. The Prowler is one of my favorite ships in the game. It indeed makes hauling - from wormholes to missions - a great deal easier and more enjoyable. For this reason, I think it should be something you have to train into that remains firmly behind the Omega wall. It's one of those things that's desirable but not necessary. The perfect goal in EVE.

Titans slap fight at each other until one winces then its all over bar the shouting. 
---
I thought i was having a stroke when i tried to read this.
---
&gt; I won at eve shortly thereafter
---
I'm not sure if I should tell him.
---
Apart from good content what you need to tell a story. The goal is not to be an exact 1-to-1 reproduction of what happened, but to retell the story so that a viewer that was not there can follow.
---
1. Context: That means giving a quick recap of who/where/what/why leading up to the fight. Maybe some schoose words from the FC as you are in route. The whole first segment of This is EVE is a good example.  
---
2. Pacing: Running EVE videos in normal speed is rarely a good idea. No one except three dedicated corp mates will watch 45 minutes of grinding HP. At the same time you want the viewer to be able to keep up, the video is made for the viewers sake. 2x speed is a good compromise, but don't be afraid of speeding up really slow parts or even cutting it out completely. Or if things gets super intense, consider running it at normal speed.
---
3. Commentary: Commentary can come in many different flavors. Including coms is the best, if not the easiest way of getting commentary. You don't need to included every syllable of sperge. Focus on that which gives the over all state of the battle. e.g. primaries, warp outs, call for reps, pilots reporting 20 ships showing up on D-scan. Once that is done add some coms which shows the over all mood of the fleet, both the good and the bad. Consider adding short texts pointing out key moments if they are not easily conveyed by the coms. Record game audio, coms and your own mic on separate audio channels so you have the flexibility when editing. Speeding up the video means removing a lot of coms, I try to keep even the bad stuff if possible but don't crowd the coms.
---
4. Perspective: From which perspective are you telling the story, what does that perspective and what doesn't it show? This is where the commentary has to fill in the blanks. I fly a lot of logi and I feel it is often a very perspective for getting a feel for the ebb and flow of the battle. Your perspective will provide an account of how well you are tanking and I let the FC calling shots tell the offensive side of the fight. I love flying the Bhaalgorn but it doesn't make for particularly good footage, you will often not have the primary locked since you are focusing on other targets and are fighting your own fight.
---
5. Camera management: Is hard when you are in the thick of if. But try to be somewhere in between zoomed in to look at my kill marks and zoomed out so far all you can see is brackets. And for the love of Bob do not have dynamic camera on.
---
6. Music: No dubstep. OK, play what ever you like, it is your video but the music is supposed to complement the video. And since coms is more or less mandatory you need to use music that does not interfere with that. So something which is a little bit on the ambient side is often easier to work with. I love classical music and have used it videos, but the high dynamic range, from barely a whisper to really loud makes it hard to work with. Getting the volume right is hard and Youtube's compression can fuck it up. Check the volume after you have uploaded the video. 
---
If you do decide to go for music which dynamic, try to find something which has a dramatic curve which follows that of the fight. This is a pain in the ass to do and will typically require that you spend some time working on scene changes and video speed to get things to line up just right. But if you succeed it can be really sexy. I tried to to that here https://youtu.be/l5RuCoK9Rnk?t=944 where the cannon shots are timed with the reports of the last ships dying.

Hey Manny &lt;3
---
Id love to see a Drake
---
Game is in a decent state i guess overall, but it all depends where you fly and what you do. What you will notice is that the pop seems much smaller than what you remember because eve, well eve is not doing so well pop wise.
---
There is no balance team tho
---
Oof
---
i see no [homeworld](http://www.homeworldshots.net/index.php?/category/34)
---
&gt; TAPI also likes to recruit the low hanging fruit with minimal alt coverage.
---
I cannot believe you actually said this in comparison to horde....... wow.
---
You're very lucky if you get a slap fight, usually it's just a lot of hissing and growling before one side puts its tail down and backs off to the dronelands to rebuild. Titan fleets are way too valuable for a sovnull group to risk them in actual fights where they could actually die. 
---
No podding, just keep it going 
---
You mad?. Love how you call Papa goon our daddies.
---
The future is now old man and if we are going by flair. Your daddy is PH.
---
Look into thera on eve-scout.com
---
And on the 8th day, God looked upon the world and said "What the fuck have I created?"
---
Meh, said from the leadership view of fall in and get in line. 
---
W4RP is trying to reform from the bear alliance it is to the leet alliance it wants to be. Will be interesting to see if you can make it happen with the old bears in charge. 
---
Haha Then let us join the fight as Well 
---
But how do you add your alliance name to your Reddit name ?

Nice job! Very cool 😎

Oh wow where are the lows?

He should really go skill himself (IRL)
---
Oï !

I can’t remember the name of an EVE youtuber and cannot find any of his old videos, however, I remember he started most of his videos with : "Welcome to the Explorer Log". He did multiples videos, one on the Crimson Flood event of past years and one where he opened a golden event case. He also did one with a Venture when the Ressource Wars came out.
---
Does anybody recognise him, please ? Or did he deleted his channel ? Thanks !
---
Johnny Pew maybe?

:P
---
Well that’s one thing we can agree on
---
he could have warped off, its a stealth bomber w/ covert cloak, takes 4 seconds to get away and he had way more than that 
---
Lets acknowledge the true war, those who call it "Bee tack Arr" and those who call it "Bee Arr Five"
---
A single 3k dps frigate though, all things considered. Yeah, sure, a bit much to drop a titan on it, but he out-escalated all the small stuff with his NPC crew (brilliant btw) so what are you going to do if your subcaps can't match the opposing fleet?   
---
Call for 50 people or just drop a dread? That the dread needed saving is hardly something anyone could have imagined. :D
---
To be fair, you did ask us to wardec all of panfam to make sure it wouldn't happen. Not really smugworthy test friend
---
pls no anure, you've gone to the bad place
---
Please throw this whole idea down that well, too.
---
Magic system in EVE?
---
Are we that bored?
---
Tbh I think they're all fine except the Damavik. Not a fan of the Vedmaks tracking bonus maybe replace that with optimal or damage, thats about it really.
---
&gt; It's ok to blame others for your big failure after WWB. The spot where you are actually is a self made problem.
---
You are probably correct, but I'm having real trouble seeing the connection to WWB in this...
---
The Whole Imperium wardecced Panfam, not just Tnt 
---
Mate, buddy, friend, don't huff paint and post!
---
No goons up here though

I answered this in the other two threads about this already.
---
It was Panfam vs Legacy. COALITION VS COALITION.And goons would have came, they prepinged for this shit
---
Brave you retard
---
You should kys ingame btw
---
cry baby faggots like you are why dreads are in the game
---
Come join us in RvB, we're alpha friendly and focus on small sized fleets.
---
Yes, that’s him !
---
As I thought, he deleted every video on his channel, sadly...
---
Yeah they stood down, cause there waa no fight
---
I dont know why the downvote when input broadcasting is used a lot.  Ecspecially when you see these generic names numbered.  Even on comms you cant be that well timed.  
---
It's not gonna snow this time around, people are paranoid for no reason 
---
Well we have magic wands for sov .... instead of ability to gun down the nodes.          
---
We got also Triglavian Enchanting for the modules ...

But i can agree ... no more....

---
That has nothing to do with his point
---
Did you not see how long it took you to do anything? You are a fucking retard bud
---
Just a bit?
---
I never filled EM holes on T1 resists simply because you sacrifice too much damage/speed/general tank for pretty much no gain. At the end of the day it´s a T1 frigate so not much EHP to work with in the first place. Pretty certain Suitonia is on the same page or some pages ahead. :) 
---
Or how hard long range fighters rape frigs.
---
Really fun to use, horrible to face
---
true.   
---
more to the point: all the NSA does is give you a 500% scan resboost,   
---
if the resulting number is big enough, a frig gets locked as quick as that guy did, if the bomber had a MWD and it was on for some reason, it would have been a near instalock 
---
I don’t think the locus rigs will turn the Kiki into a massive powerhouse. It currently hits to 50ish km max with meson and with rigs you can push it to 70km (maybe 80 but now you’re running a stupid fit with tracking computers in the mids). Also, you will be giving up a fair amount for this. 
---
The current fit is with a medium shield extender and long point and tank or speed rigs, the lack of speed rigs for range will bring it close to nano cruiser speed (and all nano cruisers will shred this thing) and you can’t really give up the mids or lows for anything without becoming a super expensive longbow corm.
---
     
---
I feel like the Damavik will improve significantly with locus rigs as the ramp mechanic is just not conducive  
---
Yeah the techno in the background is a must
---
Sitting on comms with &lt;10 people so it's not always the same annoying extrovert ppl talking all the time, and Loyality I think.

Can’t wait till they actually just disband the CSM. it’s almost as much of a joke as the real government this asswipe works for. 
---
would have lived if the pilot was awake
---
Good job, Johnie :D
---
🎺
---
later on some of them started to attack him, did the npc get mad at him for something ?
---
You should look into FW. I'm sure there are plenty of corps looking for fresh blood, you can do good enough isk with plexing and you can always be useful with only T1 hulls.
---
Holy crap, is RvB still going? I flew with you guys a decade ago, back in the Plave Okice days. Cut my PvP teeth on RvB. Think I should give it a go again :)
---
source? I have only heard player rumors, no Dev hints at all, the CSM has been quiet afaik
---
This but unsarcastically
---
Well in that video there's 2 main reasons for legions, armor doctrine and wolf rayet which both benefit the legion.
---
I haven't encountered legions in j-space for months I think, or they've either been solo or in kitchen sink fleet. Tengus, lokis and proteuses are much more common in my experience. But you might've had different luck seeing them.
---
Also kiting isn't as commonly used in j-space than in null/low afaik, because how the mechanics work, so maybe that's also a "benefit" for legion over kitey t3c's.
---
Oh and about nullified t3c's, havent encountered a single one in wh's. 
---
spaceships
---
do you have other sites than facebook? 
---
Nah the problem was directly between the chair and the screen.
---
And then Dawn Rhea starts talking and ruins the video. 
---
Who'dathought all it takes is to mention "goons are coming" and PANFAM leaves our highsec market alone
---
&gt; It was Panfam vs Legacy
---
  No it wasnt. It was HORDE/NC vs TEST for the first timer. Swap it around and HORDE would have been crying for days.
---
That's actually the problem. Titans have always been way too valuable, the only problem is, now they are way too valuable in a negative way. Back in the days (even before B-R), a Titan could change the tide of a battle, now it's merely who throws the most on the field before the server gets a stroke.
---
This should never have changed, Titans should be the worst pain in the ass to get, and fielding them should have a real meaning other than just throw them of the field to make the worst gameplay experience possible. I actually have a Titan capable pilot, but I never bought one because in all the fights I was in, I just could imagine myself being in such a ship with that amount of TiDi and literally just praying for the server not to boot me out.
---
Wonder if OP remembers failing to kill our Moa fleet in Eso even after dropping titans and supers on us multiple times.... we managed to kill some of their caps that bumped off from the blob too... ended up getting so bored we just whored on each others ships and self destructed.
---

Yep, people probably changed several times over since you left, but war ... war never changes.

---
blue standing w/ rats is great, great way to troll in incursion systems if you manage to get blue w/ sansha 
---
Has to hide his cloak instead of cyno
---
Also to be clear it's just a visual to accompany the system effects. You can't go to them.
---
Dreads are completely fine imo. They need support or close range grappler fits to be able to dunk subs for the most part, need to commit for 5 minutes without logi and can't chase you once sieged and can be countered and held by most gangs that know what they're doing.
---
It's carriers and supers which are broken at dealing with subs 
---
Gobbins could have done with this map a while back!
---
Hell no it shouldn't be easier to get in to. They are incredibly useful in niche scenarios. 
---
As for noobs needing something similar, how about cloak and mwd trick on a t1 hauler? Sure it can be cargo scanned but then...train longer for a blockade runner.
---
bad bot
---
same
---
How can you label  the loss of a human being, a fellow eve player and a son of an eve player as pro imperium?  I sincerely wish everyone the same when it comes to matters like this
---
You've forgottwn about 1 thing. Ability to reroute gate to Stain if youre in lowsec and if you're in Stain - to random lowsec system.
---
It's not that long a train anyway, I managed to get the t2 haulers, interceptors and covops plus t2 shield modules in 2 months. 
---
Ferox is in a good place
---
Because that's obviously in a different folder!
---
Base assumption is they got fleet numbers and comps
---
mystic is T2 long range :-) ... meson is T1
---
If by good place you mean "eclipses almost every other ship in its weight class" sure.
---
Link kills 
---
really makes you think, eh?
---
so it seems
---
"us"
---
I dunno. I could still fuck it.
---
what is this dumb nonsensical narrative you all are trying to push
---
This is really good and was totally unexpected.
---
But a fairly typical response for leadership.
---
Silence... just get in fleet you Indy scrubs!
---
Nobody gives intel in local save china.
---
One of those abilities is literally a ship scanner
---
One is literally a scout alt/ cloaks eyes
---
Are you going to batphone for this too?
---
So tell me what really happened then please
---
what are you on about?   
---
it was one of the largest battles and it made EVE history   
---
Christ.... it even has a nice ring to it.
---
I guess I'm one of those few that actually kind of liked the whole walking in station thing. I mean, I did want that to be expanded on, but it was still fun to sit down or see my toon actually moving around. I also liked seeing how big the pod was and what it kinda looked like inside. Also cool seeing the scale of how large these ships are.
---
Recently coming back to EvE I was sad for a few minutes when I realized that feature was out. Oh well. Now to keep hoping for walking around in my spaceship in Elite Dangerous.
---
I am curious who you are, with this very vague name.
---
That wasn't a joke!
---
Not my call to make, but who would have guessed that if you call in goons, you are not getting a fight
---
Everyone knows except Russians brainwashed by Kremlin propaganda that Crimea is annexed by Russia. If you steal bike it wouldn't be your bike, it would be stolen anyways
---
Of course you are. Should be hard to figure out since half the corps are dead or just three people and armies or alts. 
---
But I need my 15 rorq alts m8
---
The only nullified T3c I see are [scangu](https://zkillboard.com/kill/73252662/), some travel T3s and some wh groups that uses [cloaky nullified TIII logi](https://zkillboard.com/kill/74841186/)

test vs horde
---
horde get slapped to fuck with alarming regularity
---
gobbins cowards out and batphones nc.
---
test, already outnumbered, now face impossible odds against a super fleet we can't realistically contest (but still try to, of course)
---
hordelings, desperate for a morale victory on reddit, try to claim there's some distinction between being in a coalition and not being in a coalition, despite that being utter shite, and despite legacy not being involved in any meaningful capacity
---
everyone else laughs at the notion of horde opening the batphone floodgates and then lamenting that fact as if they didn't set the wheels of batphonery in motion
---
To give you an exemple :
---
A medium neut on a neut legion draws -22.5 gj/s and non bonused med medium neut does -15gj/s
---
A non bonused heavy neut TII does -25gj/s
---
Derp, yeah that, got em mixed up
---
Is it difficult to aim warp disruption probes?

Bhaalgorn are usually prefered over the legion but the bhaalgorn does not fit in C1 hole so legion you can play a part if you have to go through one

Still waiting for a day when someone decides to kill KWG in omist, at this moment KWG might be an alliance who is living the longest in one place and never moved. 
---
I was only away for a few months and I couldnt work out where all my stuff had gone. I went back to my home station and rented an office and all of my corporation hangars reappeared. So that might help.
---
as a current flyer of the damavik you reeeeallly need minimum mid grades or hg pods to make it work. they really only have 3 options 1)buffe(150k ehp with slaves 2)nano 3000 m/s with snakes 3) duel rep with asklepians. The big main issue or not really one depends on how you look at it is. For the triglavian ships they need to be blinged out to really shine. One thing ive noticed is theyre real cap sensitive ship so one neut boat can really hurt it.
---
Yep, and the meta suffers greatly for it. Since titans have no counter other than more titans, the only way to stay ahead in the sov game is to constantly turtle up and build more titans at a *massive* scale (blueing everyone within six regions to boost your isk/hr); but also you can't afford to *risk* your titans, since you're out of the sov game if they all die. It's pretty cancer. 
---
Yulai is dead
---
But we are talking about the Hs keepstar fight...
---
Funnily enough, it even has a Wikipedia page:
---
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodbath\_of\_B-R5RB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodbath_of_B-R5RB)
---
No but honestly thatd be a pretty cool idea. 
---
Atron kill Kikimora, Thrasher kill Orthrus... Today is a day of dunk kills or wtf is going on 🤔
---
Northern bois get so vexed over imperial legacy it’s great. 
---
TIL that NPCs can actually be non-aggressive to you, and even remotely repair you.  Is this a recent development?
---
very nice to watch
---
smh,
---
Assuming your flair checks you have a lot of friends you should be talking to. Oh the irony.
---
yeah but isn't the current neut legion version even stronger than before? or what am I missing?
---
I despise people that censor the fit of their super or titan 
---
dodging 2 init sabres in null with my crane was judt amazing. but yeah 300mil hauling ships(w/o fittings) isnt meant for newbros. Start training in a t1 hauler. get your hauler to 10 or less seconds of align time and a cloak with mwd. youll be more or less uncatchable unless you luck out. 
---
The top quality post I would expect from his sub.
---
I agree with you but the dude was mioving like 10m/s
---
you can't talk about the keepstar and not include the wider conflict because the context matters, although if you insist on blinkering yourself and focusing on one tiny part then the point still stands.
---
If you are new they are fine. Still you have really newbro friendly allies that will help you even if you arent in the alliance. Brave dojo brandnewbros to name a few. Best to just ask the questions in your corp or alliance chat. 
---
Reddit shits on any alliance. If you are truly new best to see what others are doing. If you need isk maybe ask corp mates how to make it.
---
Alot of guys dont like talking but you can speak via text if its kinda an issue untik you feel more confortable. 
---
Id stay off here and make your own thoughts on your alliance or even corp. Have fun dude!
---
The meta changed, FAXes were strong enough to rep fleets while totally cap dry. You need enough dps to quickly kill a t3 and cycle time fast enough to easily switch targets and stress FAX reps
---
Was this a DC or something? I **need** to know!
---
the sotiyos in nullsec can be ran by a couple of blinged out revs and Faxs

---
&gt; Telepathy: A separate chat channel that picks up random snippets of conversation occurring in systems nearby. 
---
The upside of this *feature* would be that basically all chat would then move onto Discord or other such out-of-game services, and the next time the shitty in-game chat goes tits up we aren't as effected.
---
he had neutral logi repairing him btw, not a solo kill
---
Thing is, there is no problem with batphoneing goons, we would probably do it too if roles were reversed.But then don't act suprised when we don't take the fight. 
---
&gt; CCP can we finally have NPC constellation in the middle of the drone lands so hunters can fuck with the botters in there on the daily basis?
---
Hilmar's hair just went white at the suggestion.
---
Funny how you edited the post multiple times and changed flair after the callout. You seem salty sweety
---
I want a keepstar waifu \^\_\^
---
lol no one is surprised my friend, i can assure you 
---
no honor use npc...
---
His low slots were &lt;insert corp name&gt;
---
They just pay everyone who bothers them to not bother them, very effective tactic 
---
MJD buffs and free skill injectors
---
There's a lack of 7+ rorqs with cold steel skins for it to art.
---
I mean, technically that is "good"... it just means that the other ships are 'bad'... in comparison.
---
Everything is a blob now.
---
But what about a low sec gate to Stain!? Sort out your priorities!
---
Praise James
---
Most likely he did let the atron inside 1000mtrs, after that the kikko will not hit shit with that fit.
---
Your alliance leadership is complicit with bots and aware of this transition. PGL keeping up with the good ol' days. S2N was very bot-friendly too.
---
&gt;  I'm really bad. 
---
No shit. what gave it away?
---
RMC is being cyberbullied out of the region at 50%, and will be forced to bot somewhere in the Dronelands in the coming weeks instead of just in Period Basis.
---
Omist is a logistical Nightmare
---
You realise that the definition of a renter is that he just pays and doesn’t owe you anything if he wants to leave. Literally nobody gives a shit.

You are comparing Darkness Erebus to the entire Panfam super fleet.

Why he puts his self destruct? to make the other guy engaged and forget to remove it? :D

I want to shoot and blow things  ... if i would like to play something that looks and feel like magic - there are plenty of other games out there focused on this aspect.

Where you at? We can come take a look.

That is still the Best fleet I have ever flown in.
---
I wish we get to do it again
---
Oh of course i do.       
---
To put it simply - i truly dislike boters - if there is slight chance that those assets will be blown up instead of sold and then RMT'ered ... ill post about it on reddit ... oh wait i just did it.         
---
Here is my motivation. Test don't want to have dread cache in Stain i don't want KWG boters to have isk for dirty operations.         
---
Initially not. CCP adjusted it few times, also depending on spawn those dreads will die ... so why risk if you can just use supers and shoot it from safe distance.           
---
Simple, dont use the 100mn sig tank fit in drone lands.
---
Swap to a 10mn, pith c med booster active tank instead.
---
There is too much debris for a decent 100mn.
---
Heavies work just fine, kill elite frigs first to stop webs.
---
For a very simple reason.           
---
People in high places have good reason to not touch them.         
---
Sad but true. 
---
It was not meant to be shitpost. 
---
What have making botter life miserable have to do with ingame balance issue?
---
What toxicity?
---
I break the ice by asking the age old unanswered question.
---
If your partner dies during sex, At which point does it become necrophilia? 
---
I heard  [skill urself](https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99007379/) &lt;INGME&gt; has a pretty decent German corp.
---
Unlucky. Trasher boi had logi help BTW. :wink:
---
I hope you're still taking good care of your corpses
---
I say we just get all the titans in eve, warp to 100 on the sun in [random NPC null system]
---
And all of them fight to the death. No support. No faxes. No escalations. Just got, sexy, Titan on Titan action.
---
Last man standing self destructs.
---
Make it the largest titan battle in all of eve history. We can make a new monument out of it, it will get some nice press, a new group of new players will surge in and eve will be better for it.
---
Certainly better than them collecting dust.
---
No, problem was entirely on the chair. 
---
This add sounds disgustingly german
---
&gt; At this occasion, CCP can we finally have NPC constellation in the middle of the drone lands so hunters can fuck with the botters in there on the daily basis?
---
like this wasn't possibly now
---
Karmafleet has a much cooler ticker.
---
You have the magic vault for them now anyway. So sad.
---
In theory there are more counters than just throw more titans at the titan(s) but that would really break the servers. 
---
Can you just change the ammo instead of the gun and impact tracking/ramp up etc. that way?
---
Can we toss you down said well after the coin?
---
Not had an update recently but who knows. Hopefully it's back I really like that app

That way more impressive than what I had in mind. 😀
---
Forget about it. ROI is getting so low even on capital BPCs that you need like 2 years to make even. I have ME9 Nidhoggur BPO that I don't even sell anymore as they are wortch like 6 mln each. Dreads and Rorquals are not much better. 
---
woops big typo wasnt nullsec meant to be lowsec
---
No it is not.       
---
NPC constellation allow you to have assets in NPC station where you and your 10 friends can keep assets and look for stuff to kill.     
---
Because there will be multiple groups like you - much more people will be moving around.        
---
It is not about those big guys that drop fort in the middle of enemy space as they can defend it - but about those 20 smaller groups that will move also around spoiling the bot active times.            
---
**You started to defend the 'Bot Lands' of the drones ... like do you have business in keeping local ratters (and botters ) undisturbed ?**
---
&gt; You started to defend the 'Bot Lands' of the drones ... like do you have business in keeping local ratters (and botters ) undisturbed ?
---
Rather pointing out that it's free for all hunting grounds already - it's a free frontier land for hunters with endless herds of targets.
---
I mean if you're so incompetent that you have to have an NPC station, you probably  better stay in high sec
---
They are the predators that keep the natural balance, otherwise all the people that would love to just "make ISK and lose nothing" would crash the games economy pretty fast and EVE would be dead complete.
---
I mean, in VG's marauders are quite ok.
---
Ayo ))
---
Trying to end his streak?
---
and again you can do it 90% of times even without fax, simply you can get spawn that will blast those dreads out and at the same time you can do it safely in supers ... so why even consider blinged out dreads with good skills. 
---
cheers mate, have a good one!

Wow, you're a massive retard. Go back to serenity k thx

Titans are at 0 ... but yeah have fun dropping tackle fleet, rats will murder your fleet.

Go with dreads?    
---
Well they will all die to rats before siege cycle ends.

Every fucking alliance has a group called voltron it seems

I think Legacy B-team is much more suiting, considering it’s basically the sequel to DRF b-team (let’s hope it ends the same way)

Yup. Watching the keep get anchored for the first time and all the dramagot me to join up.

Best decision ever.
---
Remove a gun from the ferox, leave it with 2 utility highs. Dps would go down a decent amount. Maybe even consider dropping the optimal bonus from 10% per level to 5% per level.
---
Its pretty crazy the Ferox does 85% of what a vulture can do, for a fraction of the cost.
---
Vulture with 3 magstabs = 538dps @ 40.5km+15km using antimatter
---
Ferox with 3 magstabs = 538dps @ 34km+19km using antimatter
---
The ferox is also faster and has the same scan res. The only thing the vulture has is better tank and link bonuses (which are strong, not to say the vulture is worthless, just the Ferox is stepping all over its toes).
---
If you dropped a turret and nerfed range to 5% per level, it would look like this:  
---
Ferox with 3 magstabs = 448dps @ 26km+19km using antimatter, or with spike, its 260dps @ 91.5km@19km
---
i love how its a proper article that even lists the fc's as commanders of each side

Does ccp have any plans to fix this? seems like an annoying mechanic.
---
Realistically there's no way for anything to compete with fax reps. Even titan vs. titan fights devolve into fat alphafleet play - DD volleys to kill something before reps can land. 
---
If faxes weren't retardedly good it'd be possible for dreads to counter titans, at least in isk efficiency terms.

WTB 500% sig res boost module for battleships.
---
Actually, i'd be happy if battleships didn't have the same scan res as capitals. Kind of unfun that a carrier/dread/super can lock a battleship and blap it before the battleship can even lock fighters. Not that locking a carrier's fighters will help in most cases against a battleship, but its the principle of the matter.
---
NSA is a cheesy module that should just be removed. Capitals should just rely on SEBO's like everything else. If my Scorpion navy issue needs to take 30s to lock something, so should your super carrier. Just put SEBO's on it. Then capital pilots need to make more fitting decisions on if they want to lock fast, or have more tank/application.
---
Then, with the NSA gone, you can remove the stupid EWAR fighters so carriers aren't capable of pointing/webbing/dps'ing everything while maintaining max tank/application.
---
"But muh anti-fighter defanging lock speed"
---
Just make SS fighter's sigs much larger than normal fighters. Its not like SS fighters are used anywhere outside of defanging, so it won't effect solo caps/small groups of caps when defending against a small gang.
---
just fly logi, healbeam the ones that scream, whore like a motherfucker and enjoy your stupidly green killboard

balance capitals then talk about balancing other ships / game mechanics.

One don't post on reddit about it. You will attract people who either want to gank you or infiltrate to ruin it for you. And two i think the mods add those flairs to a big stockpile so your corp/alliance has to be big enough for them to bother with.

Part of why this subreddit thrives I think

I whent wormholing yesterday, with intends to find me some gas. Turned out to a few hours of exploration. Wound up in the other end of new eden compared to where i live, and in lowsec. Good times.

N3/PL, which was basically what Panfam was called 5 years ago, accidentally dropped sov in their staging system, either due to an error or a bug, depending who you ask. 
---
The Russians had been at war with N3PL, and attacked the system, trying to take Sov and claim the npc station there. N3PL dropped everything it had in terms of supers to push them back, but the Russians called in the CFC, and dropped their own Titan fleet. 
---
At first, N3PL was trading favorably, but they weren’t getting the reinforcements they needed. So, to damage the lines of communication between the CFC and the Russians, they primaried Sort Dragon’s Titan, as he was the leader of the Russian coalition. 
---
However, Sort’s Titan was much tankier than a normal Titan, and by the time it went down N3PL had lost 5 of their own. They still never got reinforcements, while the CFC/Russians did, and eventually lost the numbers to alpha enemy titans, and then the CFC/Rus coalitions just went to town on them until DT, which was 23 hours away. 
---
All told, N3PL lost 59 Titans, while CFC/Rus lost 16. It confirmed the CFC as the dominant power bloc until WWB, and was the bloodiest battle of all time in Eve Online 
---
Not all players use bots.

It won't, and mostly because of other people like you lol.

If I ever read the word "updoot" again you're banned.

I’m not quite sure what you are trying to say. But if you used three injectors that would make sense. After 5m sp the injectors only give 400k sp per inject

Don't nerf ships before I get a chance to fly them

I read one sentence and i'm now debating it.

Updoot

You have a closet camper in our staging? Maybe look at it from time to time.

A new alliance could be healthy for the game and for Lowsec.

But posting about it on reddit will just get you unwanted attention.

Your friend should follow that guys advice and stop mining in highsec.

I think you have us confused with LSH. 
---
Mate that’s really impressive, I hope you’re suitably proud of yourself. 
---
you are already doomed cause you have written on reddit that you founded a new alliance with location
---
Bud if you think this way - you have no idea.            
---
VNI is one of the less effective ways you can use bot now.         
---
You have multiple chars in the system and from what i know - the moment issues started big players included code that check who is on local and if chars don't see each other - the dock.      
---
Profs?    
---
Like none of this communication is floating ingame, what more it is not even getting to me directly but from a friend from Ukraine that knows russian and have access to channels.          
---
The most important part here - professionals don't run bots untended they are observed when they run by person that when something is going badly issue command to "dock to all accounts".    
---
It is quite easy to monitor bots in a single constellation with minimal effort.

&gt; WTB 500% sig res boost module for battleships.
---
the NSA is capital only, and those exist, while not getting you a 100% bonus, if you are willing to sacrifice all tank a row a SEBO's does the same, alternatively fit one or 2 sebos w/ res scripts 
---
Cached values.  I've seen the same.   The login screen says one thing,  and the skill queue tab reads a larger number.
---
I wonder sometimes how many of the players who joined in the post B-R world of Brave Newbies etc felt shortchanged that big, map-altering, battles like that are so long and boring.

Yep.  The point is to exert power over powerless targets.  They are pure trolls.  Who could be less able to defend themselves than hi sec miners?

Carebear pvp more accurate.  Avoid all targets that can defend themselves and torment newbies.

Nope lol I'm not rich enough to use injectors so wily nilly but I'm thinking it's because of what the other commenter said. Thank you for replying

---
Try pausing and unpausing your queue. It's pretty common for my chars to be 500k to a 1m SP lower than my out of game tools say they should be. Pausing and unpausing always fixes it.

Yes, I fucking know what it does you nitwit. The point I was trying to make is that you painted in the light of "oh its just 500% no big deal!"

it also takes a fuckload of cap, but i digress, what they can do is give it an aggro timer, kinda like smartbombs do

I have always thought mining could be so much more engaging.  Like you have to keep your laser from overheating, by toggling on and off.  Or you have to end the pull within a certain window, to get max yield.  Or just more small rocks.  Basically they need some kind of minigame every so often like hacking is.  Something that cant be so easily automated.  And hopefully fun to take the boredom out of the mining grind.

There's nothing that could realistically be done to the Apostle right now that couldn't be reasonably countered by "Ok, well now you need \*two\* Apostle alts" per super/titan.

---
If "those already exist", then we don't need an NSA for caps, just "use SEBO's" as you mentioned. If it works for battleships, should be fine for capitals, right?
---
What tank are you giving up to fit an NSA? None
---
What EWAR capability are giving up? None (because of EWAR fighters)
---
Meanwhile, for a battleship to not lock like a capital, it normally takes a mid+low (SEBO+Sig amp) or a mid+Rig. This means a battleship loses tank, dps and/or application just to lock a little faster than a capital ship (before NSA).
---
EVE is about fitting decisions, its probably one of the best ways the game can be balanced. Instead, we have NSA's which are a no brainer to put on every carrier/supercarrier because you lose nothing. Then you can cram your mids with tank and application mods and lows with DDA's. Or go full application on armor carriers and still retain max tank.
---
There are no decisions being made, its all the same cookie cutter, max dps/application fits.
---
ccp is going to milk money from players, and they are pretty happy  about alts.
---
But for true 1v1 you have abyssal dungeons for now
---
Oh no, my capacitor in a CAPITAL ship for a 500% scan res bonus, the horror.
---
You're right. 100% balanced.

---
If you are training long skill like Capital Ships V - the total SP is updated **after** training is completed or stop/start training. 
---
ge wizz i wonder what uses capacitor  
---
oh wait my jumpdrive needs 75% and if i get neuted by some ships i could not even be capstable, killing my resists entirely
---
ferox would become nonexistant solo/small gang though
---
you loose something when fitting an NSA , a slot for a Figher support unit (damage) or shield/armor links (tank) or cyno (help me device) on a super you might not even be able to fit the burst projector if you wanna do max damage/tank + nsa 
---
he can tri
---
Wormholer btw.
---
 If you're getting into exploration as an alpha, or in general, you should learn how to ID holes (or make an educated guess) based on what you see when you hit "show info" on the hole itself; very helpful. Also something else, you can tell what class wormhole you're in by looking at the constellation, i think it is. They're lettered A-F, and they run from 1-6. So you'll have the system number (J#), and then you should see the constellation (A#, B#, C#, etc). 
---
Also, if you're new to exploration, always, always, always, always be spamming dscan. You should be spamming dscan so much that you do it in kspace where you don't really need to. Then you'll feel dumb :D
---
Who needs supers when you have battle ventures though
---
where is the proofs
---
diamond rats are already supposed to be citadel bashing, which they sometimes do well.  This was more meant of a "what would be interesting to add to wormhole space without obviously being game breaking, or useless.
---
And this, boys and girls, is how power creep happens.
---
It pretty much already is nonexistant in small gang/solo. 
---
Its too slow for solo/small gang. Sure, the blaster version is fine and can brawl, but that won't change with whats mentioned here. Will be easier to fit too, so the dual XLASB version would probably get stronger. You'll just lose some damage, but potentially gain a 2nd link.
---
If you're kiting with a rail Ferox, you'd be better off with a rail brutix as its faster and does more damage, plus its range is fine for most engagements. Combined with the self-rep bonus, the brutix is a better small gang platform if you want to rail kite+link.

I think the Sansha Crystal Quarry and Science Outposts are the sites that have the potential to net the most money. Crystal Quarry and Science Outposts are the sites you wanna do, no matter the faction. Buddy of mine ran a relic site in an adjacent wormhole and came out with 96mil in intact armor plates from a single can. Ended up with 120mil+ profit after he finished the site. 
---
TLDR; fuck data sites, relic sites are where the money printers are
---
It remembers the owner of the ship. His alt who brought the ceptor for him didn't have as high standings as him.
---
You most likely laugh at Gevlon back then
---
Be a girl.
---
Being slightly too strong is arguably better than being unusably weak. It doesn't mean I'm opposed to it being dialed back; and at least in the case of it being too strong you have the useage data of *why* it's too good.
---
HAVE YOU EVER FLOWN A TRIGLAVIAN SHIP? I would love to see this  *"When you let the Kiki poke up to 600 dps with Mystic S from 80-100km"*. Also want to buy triglavian locus rigs please. LOL your post is bad and you should maybe fly the ships more....
---
Literally all in the game already. 
---
**Farsight**: x% Chance to view a specific local from any number of jumps away  
---
x% determined by how bothered you can be, or an alliance mate can be to log in a cloaky set of eyes.  
---
\-% modifier added for how rudely you ask them to do so.
---
**Gateview**: Similar to farsight, but this ability is brought with your fleet, hauler or space wessel, and deployed forward to the next gate. This is an ability with charges. N of charges is equivelent to how many scouts are in your fleet.  
---
To use this ability, send a scout forward +1, if he dies, remove one charge.
---
**ViewCockpit**: Literally a ship scanner.
---
**ControlCockpit**: Only available for specific modules! Wish to turn off an MJD or a MWD? use the control item. Warp Scrambler. Be careful! overheating may indeed affect your own modules!
---
**Telepathy**: Literally a Spai account
---
&lt;Insert creative name here&gt;: The ability to sense spais in the alliance you are currently spai-ing upon. And play verbal hinting games over coms to the fact that you know, that they know, that some of you might know.  
---
Then, you have to engage in a mating dance all whilst being undetected. Fall in love. And get married in a shotgun wedding at a shadey chappel during Eve-Vegas. (A Civil Partnership, obviously, if goons)   
---
Finally, once you are both married and Spai. Inevitably downwards spiral until you are desperately attempting to destroy one another (In game.) in a re-enactment of Mr &amp; Mrs Smith (Two Brad-pitts, in the case of goons... Obviously) with many explosions, double crosses, and a final duel on the jita undock to represent the department store.
---
But that's just, like, my opinion on the subject, whatever.
---
Add some stations with drone hive models. With hammerheads as security agents
---
Love's everywhere man
---
You must be new here.
---
Yeah. They just matter a lot. 
---
how much bother would i need to be? i'm looking to get on this gravy train.
---
PASS i cant fly an "atorn"
---
What do you happen to use Rhino for if you don't mind me asking? I used it during my yacht design days.
---
Yeah, lol, I mean if we're being real, they weren't looking for a gudfite, they wanted to protect their market cash cow investment. I would've done the same thing. But you gotta do the local and reddit song and dance as part of the game. Keepstars are shitty content anyways, they're either blueball boring, Batphone blobs, or ultra hell dunks. The good fights happen on those random astra/raitaru/sotiyos(sp?)
---
I know, I've flown the damn thing solo, and unless you get tackle, you die in it.  However,ds the one saving grace it has is the optimal bonus.
---
Losing damage and getting a second link is pointless.  Flying a ferox for links is generally ridiculous, as its better to use a med neut or nos in the highslot if you have fitting room, and dual xlasbs died with the fitting nerf.
---
Well, you have lowsec voltron, who repelled goons in lowsec just before WWB.
---
And legacy -test, who have done nothing of note except ride test's coattails.
---
Lowsec voltron, best voltron.

The history of mmos is a good topic. Starting from wow, the original, all the way to the current king of mmos, wow
---
stop being silly, oasa is a clusterfuck of bots and you know it
---
brick tank small SB atrons? man you have the best ideas you know that? 
---
Ugh, that blows
---
how can that be? there’s a bot report button ingame just hit it
---
Jita 4-4 has never been shot at
---
Also passive moon mining generated more med and low moon ores mined, as Rorqual miners are chery picking cunts that min/max.
---
That led to an avg. 50% increase in T2-prices.
---
A tower that was put up for content does not mind if its R64 or R16, the miner just guzzled the goo to get some of uphold costs back no matter what quality.
---
I mean, you could just get paid off, then evict them anyway.
---
Looks good
---
Hey man, at least you didn't do it in some retarded 2b tengu. Don't give up on the astero, it and the stratios are some of my favorite ships in game
---
Yikes.
---
CCP said that is actually the opposite. You're not getting the large capital escalations that happened before but there's people getting killed more often apparently
---
It's almost like he wanted to change everything that made him lose, also lets change caps and supercaps so blobbing with subcaps will be even more important, that will be great for the game for sure
---
I really like text on screen explaining what's happening (context) and real time speed. 
---
The funny thing is truly balancing (read: nerf) caps and supers would be decidedly detrimental to the game play fueling his and his closest allies' alliances.
---
+1. Hilmar here's some new content:
---
&gt; "...focused scans of deep space in Malpais have revealed several new, entirely artificial star systems. Believed to have been constructed by a rogue drone collective AI overmind, following the deviation from the Gallente Federation in YC109.  Early explorers have confirmed the drones have developed the scaffold for what seems to be several gigantic artificial planets, in orbit around nearby dwarf stars. The planets are bristling with defenses and are invisible to most scanning platforms, until the Sisters of EVE unlocked new wide range scanning arrays from Triglavian relics, uncovering the new systems and working with local capsuleer factions to gather data and establish forward outposts.
---
&gt; "Rogue drone swarms have amassed their new artificial planets from the vast quantity of precious materials in the asteroid belts that encircle the dwarf stars.  The new drone systems bring an unpleasant answer to where the innumerable rogue drone reinforcements have been originating from. Reports of thousands of shipyards producing drones relentlessly has caused a state of alarm among empires...."
---
No big differences really, goons share. Different groups get themselves setup in different pockets, I'm not very familiar with where they tend to hang out outside of the main trade hub though. 
---
I see them around frequently. 
---
Just from reading their recruitment materials, it kinda sounds like karmafleet has a notable program focused on recruiting and training newbees to fight in large fleets, Ascendance comes off as being a little more general, possibly more of a focus on capital warfare. 
---
tl;dr 
---
&gt;i lost to this mechanic, therefore it needs to be removed
---
ahhh i forgot that was there, since its not really having any effect, tought it was a place holder for future reporting ui
---
Yeah right, nobody's memeing "kick snooo."
---
It's one of the uglier capitals, ngl
---
Haw titans could literally [track the old armor T3 AB doctrine.](https://youtu.be/4Qnrql_Zni8?t=699) Tell me how that is healthy for the game lmao
---
Pretty sure everyone wants that feature back
---
AHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
Lmao oh..
---
&gt; they’re only overpowered when they’re used against you
---
I remember when PL went south to Curse and extended Provi deployment, it was strictly a subcap deployment, yet every fight Test was involved with, multiple super caps and caps were used
---
What a hypocritical piece of shit
---
you shut your handsome face
---
Lemme remove the mechanic that guarantees dominance of imperial legacy with the biggest superfleet in game. 
---
Maybe he just finally accepted that the game mechanic that made test and goons strong is bad for the overall game
---
Damavik is crap, I think we can all agree on that.  
---
As for splitting the weapons... how about NO.  
---
They are great ships, but not without easily countering them with a single range tracking disruptor.  They range is limited on most of the hulls (except the Kiki) and a single TD will force most trig ships into changing out their ammo to lower DPS, or force them into a range they aren't comfortable with.  Aside from that, the Kiki is super squishy. Can be easily countered by a jackdaw, beam confessor, or rail hecate which can snipe the shit out of it and apply DPS better from the start making a 1 vs 1 sniper fest, leave the Kiki with less tank and range at 4 X the cost minimum. 
---
As for Triglavian Logistic ships.... do you not understand how hull bonuses and fittings work?  I get 70% of guardian reps before any ramp up from 72KM away!!! on top of that I also get huge logi drone bonus.  More speed than any other T2 logi, more tank, and way more utility. For small gang fights, the triglavian ships are insanely OP especially if you have an early ramp up on a heavy tackle or control ship for kiting gangs. The only issue with this ships is in larger fights target switching makes the triglavian ships fall short, but that is ok for me.  I don't mind having a logi ship that is designed for small gangs we need more of this and less BLOB VS BLOB.
---
They'll rep you?! Holy shit that's hilarious
---
You know, the “just drop capitals” on them of this war will be fucking with botters, which in turn fucks with CCPs profits from them. Happy jihading
---
Sounds like someone is triggered and giving up being clean!
---
Pretty much this. Eve pilots asked for something to counter the carrier proliferation, and the Triglavians we're born. Yes you can counter with other shiptypes, but Trig gives small gangs a hope of fighting the carrier menace, and killing them too.
---
Well said
---
What?
---
None of these matter in an all out Titan vs Titan battle...
---
People are going to shit all over this because it's PGL and the way he's going about it seems pretty fucking retarded.
---
It's hard to argue though, capitals in their current state are not good for the game.
---
join goons, use their shipping
---
I don't agree with this actually. Subcaps are easy to move, but supers and to a lesser degree caps aren't. If you make caps/supers unable to server as a counterbalance to larger sub fleets then the coalition with the largest subcap blob (Goons, TAPI, and NC/PL in that order) wins.
---
Most carrier's don't have links (except for dedicated fleet carriers). Ratting carrier/response carrier's very rarely have links. Checking the killboard, i found 2 out of 12 niddy's that died yesterday that had links. One just had 1 link and the other had 2 (some weird kiting niddy with double skirmish links that had plates).  
---
In reality, the only thing you're losing (if you are indeed running 2 links) is a cyno which doesn't effect your actual fitting/tank/application. You can go 2 links, 2 FSU's and NSA. You lose what, 100 dps from not having a 3rd FSU? Oh no, instead of 2900 dps, you're only doing 2800 dps. Meanwhile, you still have 4 dda's, double omni links and tank. A battleship would be losing at least 1/3 of its dps if it lost a low dps slot, or a good portion of tank if it used a SEBO in the mid or scan res rig.
---
Its pretty funny that you shoo away battleships with "just use a mid full of SEBO's" (which doesn't give a 500% scan res bonus, more like 60% bonus each+stacking), when you're getting a Hi-Slot 500% SEBO, with Hi slot damage mods, low slot damage mods and Hi slot tank mods. You lose nothing, except maybe a cyno. But a cyno doesn't effect fitting, its just your safe space button, as in you don't need one to perform your role as a carrier.
---
&gt;  I've done my best to bite my tongue, but after conversing with the **other FCs from other nullsec alliances** the past few hours, **as well as the current competent CSM members**, I've deciding I can no longer take it. 
---
Everyone that is not a spodbrain or lets his hateboner think for him knows how bad the balance is rightnow
---
Wtb scalpel poster. This is excellent!
---
You ever heared of our lord and saviout the scap umbrella. Making rorqs and most caps really hard to touch?
---
Or just keep it the same. There are numerous other ships that need balancing imho.
---
You can also drag the last skill to the back of the queue for an update as well.
---
I was expecting something more dank than this.
---
Tapi loses a deployment, immediately points to caps as the problem lmao
---
Progod is not among that group of people.
---
I meant in respect to defending Rorquals.
---
how about u get gud instead of trying to remove shit that u don't know how to use. other alliances playing the same game are winning left and right with the same tools everyone has. idk if ccp can't be reasoned with or not, but the game shouldn't be changed cause the losing side doesn't like losing lol. if anything, a successful group's input would be significantly more relevant since they obviously know both how shit works and how to use it.
---
For posting an article about my favorite corp??? That's a little harsh. 
---
But if it makes you feel cool. Sure. 
---
New player here. Why does everything sell for so low in Rens? I thought it was a major trade hub. Basically every item is 90% under market price when I go to sell it. Am I doing something wrong? If not, where is a good place to sell items?
---
The core problem has always been proliferation, and it's the singular thing CCP will absolutely never touch. Progod doesn't have any problem with that - only with mechanics that inconvenience him from N+1ing everything.
---
5 paragraphs, and then this dribble. Do you even lift bro?
---
dude sounds like a cry baby lmao
---
I will try that next time as I'm always paranoid I'll leave a character paused by mistake. 
---
I'm training the month long scanning skill
---
I mean, I'd rather be blobbed by subcaps than capitals. No matter what changes are made, blobs will always be a thing. But at least you can pick off stragglers and dumbos from subcap blobs.
---
"reeee"
---
I like how it’s all test nerds defending PGL for his blatant hypocrisy 
---
When that happens hundreds of Titan pilots will resub, and CCP will cancel the shutdown. 
---
Fuck PL. 
---
You do know that we allways admitted how strong supers and caps were way before we moved north and lost the deployment right?
---
will you include install instructions so someone who is paranoid could host it for themselves?
---
What do you think happens after the Titan vs Titan battle where one side achieves superiority?
---
The problem is if you nerf proliferation now then imperial legacy will forever dominate the game, and CCP will absolutely not remove ships from player's hangars
---
Unless you remove light fighters it would change nothing. SCap umbrellas exist to prevent dreads from countering anti-subcap capitals from dropping safely. This change would only nerf titan anti-sub usage but ultimately not the deterrant that titans pose against dreads.
---
They matter in the Titan vs subcap meta, which they use to no risk build more Titans. Mechanics like those are absolutely what brought such great strength to the alliances playing the krab meta.
---
is there a contest for dumbest war ever? cause if there is this should be called the Spectrum War
---
What makes you think this would be a good idea for eve?
---
Is this like some reverse psychology shit posting? knowing it was going to get leaked on reddit or was he just that out of his mind to think it wouldnt make it here? 
---
I mean, at this point TEST benefits from strong supers as much as anyone else. The test (shield) super fleet is similar in size to that of the north. 
---
The strength of supers has undoubtedly been the main reason for stagnation and coalescence of power in the game.
---
A nerfing of supers/titans in TYOOL 2019 would help restore roaming and combat operations outside of full super deployments or wiping out groups without supers. It would also be a nerf to theta-like defensive fleets and force the defenders to put more bodies into fleets to defend their assets. 
---
Down with capitals  
---
The only counter to TAPI+Goon subcap spam!
---
You are mistaking salt for facts friendo and which evac are you talking about I've had to do a few so you know.  
---
You know how hypocritical this sounds? Idk I can literally point to every battlereport down south with tapi and being overblobbed 3:1 with caps and subcaps pounding PL
---
It’s just so ironic that after PL finally left the south and allowed some breathing room for the legacy coalition to grow and infrastructure to be put into place (in which super caps and caps heavily helped make that happen) they now want to call to a nerf to capitals? Lmao
---
&gt;Subcaps are easy to move, but supers and to a lesser degree caps aren't
---
Eh, not really. Astras/Forts/KS + jump/cyno beacons make it brain dead easy to move caps now, and subs even more so when I think nothing of sticking them into my suitcase dread.
---
Just last weekend, I was solo moving my dread without a scout, which was fucking unthinkable 8 years ago. If I did that before all this convenience came about, my corp CEO at the time would've torn me a new asshole before letting a battalion of monkeys plunder the new hole while it's still bleeding.
---
Who cares they already will because the game isn’t growing. 
---
Status quo cements them more than any MeTA cHaNgE 
---
Not anymore
---
Jita or Amarr are better places.
---
Jesus fucking christ.
---
Calm the fuck down PGL.
---
2019-01-32 10:23:56: progodlegend: also, buff dread bombs
---
TDIL super carriers can shoot bubbles. I thought they was like other dictors. 
---
I don't mean in a mid-long term strategic sense. I mean that right now you can take a subcap fleet in o-v, or 1dq, or whatever, and get it across the universe in &lt;30 minutes with the smallest amount of planning. You can't really do that with capitals.
---
&gt;Rorqs are a problem
---
Pretty much, you can balance whatever bullshit you like, in the end as long as you can build insane amounts of caps/scaps due to rorqual mining: any kind of "tweak" beyond making them completely useless will be minuscule noise at best
---
Test/legacy should lead by example and not drop supers on subs. 
---
Nothing about PANIC
---
Nothing about injectors 
---
Nothing about light fighter or LR fibo application 
---
Nothing about citadel mechanics 
---
All of those do far more damage to the game than a GTFO. When was the last time anyone actually used one? Is progod still mad about his nightmare fleet being chain gtfo’d by NC?
---
unironic “I lost to this please nerf it” post and the only thing good in there was siren (should be support fighter) mwd
---
Thanks
---
I fail to see what this upcoming war will have to do with genocidal pony-zombie body-changing Mind Rapists.
---
Test are kinda the biggest perpetrators when it comes to dropping supers on subs, it's just not fun though especially when it makes casual PVP content pointless due to the standard response of drop supers and f1.
---
Dude what, it's been 5 years? WTF? How long ago was the Battle of Assakai? That's the one that introduced me to Eve.
---
No one gives a fuck what a shitty ex-sc2 player cares about
---
But my OPSEC
---
hypocritical? Yes but come on, the balance is actually shit
---
&gt;Just keep it on our forums for now   
---
well that lasted an entire.. what? 2 hours?   
---
Google search "ghost training bug", it shouldn't work anymore.  You can still fly ships that are allowed as an alpha, but if you trained them past a certain point the skills won't apply.  If  you are in a non alpha shop, it won't let you undock.  If you have non alpha mods, they'll go offline.
---
The war will Start this weekend?
---
not sure how a video of a maelstrom fleet getting lanced was supposed to be evidence that haw titans could track armor t3s
---
Maybe not the best wording for what you want to accomplish but I understand.
---
or
---
it's just pgl and dinobrains like you who parrot whatever dumb shit he says
---
&gt;1) remove GTFOs
---
okay just for posterity
---
can anyone with confidence cite an example of a time when a gtfo was used in combat, and not to troll a fleet waiting to bridge?
---
make titans, wich are ship railguns, even more of a shiprailgun ... yay? 
---
Code isn't letting the game alive though. They just aren't that important.
---
What about TAPI+Goon cap/supercap spam?
---
You can also counter comp subs, or at the very worst can unironically be happy that you wasted a bunch of people's time and effort to watch you warpoff whereas super responses literally just involve 5 or 6 people right clicking and jumping to cyno from their haven.
---
Good grief 
---
... which is facilitated by titan jumpbridges which everyone and their mother has now.
---
And said titan is also a capital.
---
PGL may frequently be a bit of a pompous bastard and I don't always agree with him, but I'm on board with addressing the issues with capitals tbh. Then again, I'm biased. I enjoy flying subcaps a lot more than sitting around in a capital and twiddling my thumbs for an 80% probability of a blueball. 
---
Turns out, when you are chock full of spies, things get leaked really fast.
---
this is going to be a productive thread not filled with shit slinging and hyperbole at all.
---
Are you seriously this much of a fucking retard? Or do you gloss over everything for reddit karma?
---
Exploration of relic sites in c1-c3 whs nets a very good amount of isk for non-omegas. In some cases I've gotten 70mil in isk from a single site. The sleeper sites are garbage. Data sites of any kind are not worth doing with the exception of dronelands. Dronelands have no relic sites but the data sites can be very profitable.
---
This really does come off as a "oww my butthurts" post
---
Jita has it’s own permanent node. A fight in any other system will never affect it.
---
Cant be the "top dog" in a game no one plays, just try to figure out the perfect moment to RMT your account before the failscade hits critical mass and dies due to shit balancing and the blue doughnut
---
Says the guy on the spectrum
---
I saw that, it's nice for the more forgetful among us!  I've gotten 32 down to less than 1/2 hour before, apparently I'm bad about restocking.  Normal people definitely don't need to carry that many :)

Did you even watch the video? You got an attention span of like 2 seconds. At the end of the clip you see the old armor T3's getting dunked on by HAW titans

Hasn't he cried about pl before? 
---
IIRC, it was used quite a bit when goons+test tried invading the north the first time.
---
What's that? 
---
Capitals arent too big a deal, Proliferation promoted by rorquals is.
---
TBQH jump gates are far worse than Titans in current meta. You can go from Delve to Deklein in 14 jumps atm, just as an example.
---
xDddxdd triggered sjw rentlord EVISCERATED by ben stainpiro with LOGICAL FALACIES and RUMOR MONGERING 
---
Oh idk? How many Legacy keepstars have been placed down since PL left?
---
It was used in hakonen fairly successfully during the goon deployment.
---
You can fight a subcap blob with bombs, booshers, ewar, neuts, bubbles to split them, range to kite them, you can headshot anchors and you can counter their doctrines. And that's not theoretical BS, all of those things are happening in real subcap fights. If you're better than them you have a realistic chance of beating them, even at 2:1 or worse odds, because you've got a ton of tools and tactics at your disposal. EVE's history is full of relatively small but really good PVP groups who took down much bigger blobs because they were simply better at it.
---
Not so for capitals. You get blobbed by capitals you gotta bring more capitals. No booshing, no bombing, no ewar, no maneuvering past the initial cyno, no counter doctrine besides "bring more FAXs, bring more supers". No options, no tactics. Just numbers. 
---
You really want to tell me that's not bringing down the quality of the PVP in the game? That capital blobs are better for "the little guy"?
---
ccpls add supertitans and ultratitans and make them super hard to build
---
So what PGL is saying is to Rollback to 2012.
---
Why the fuck are you on about Keepstars? Are you honestly crying that a group who uses Supers and HAW titans sees how retarded they are to the game as a whole? And you're sat there crying hypocrisy. I know you try your hardest to be a living cliche but come on mate, go have a smoke or a wank.
---
Except that he doesn't propose any changes to the ability of supers to protect rorqs and other krabs. All the things he's proposing are targeted at combating your ability to counter n+1 risk free t1bc spamming by using capitals and super capitals. 
---
Not everything is a conspiracy, Omist after all is a region that is a royal pain in the ass to actually live in.
---
The first times goons deployed north to Hakonen without their supers. 
---
One of the fights over their anchoring Fortizars /u/Doomchinchila had one or two of the Titans GTFO one of the fleets (I might have actually been pgl, idr which FC got hit) several times and was dying from laughter on comms after the target kept complaining about it. 
---
The GTFO in TiDi, is absolute aids.
---
Funny af to use tho.
---
Crystal clear, thanks!
---
Huh? Did you make a habit of moving your dread across deep hostile nullsec or something? Everywhere else, NPC stations and outposts/conqs were ubiquitous.
---
Is coincidentally not affected at all by the changes he's proposing. 
---
*Specific* examples with dates and battle reports? No. But I've been GTFO'd in combat more than twice. Not a ton of times — not enough to consider it a problem — but it has happened.
---
Personally I think it's a pretty nifty mechanic. Maybe it needs some balance tweaks, but I don't think it needs to be removed entirely.
---
Or maybe idk I remember when tapi entosised Provi, it was mandatory that every toaster had a fax buddy
---
They’re **only** ok if tapi uses them lol
---
I'm just waiting for the Vily apology post.
---
'Blah blah we weren't really going to brigade /r/eve awful suggestions to improve the game...blah blah We obviously have no say in what CCP doand no amount of reddit crying will change that....blah blah..'
---
Use a titan for a short bridge that gives fatigue, or use an ansiblex for no fatigue or regular gates that can travel much further.
---
For last leg stuff or where infrastructure isn't set up, sure titan bridges arent used, but they're really not the reason for subcap mobility. 
---
Welcome to real life? How long have you spent sat at a computer? Jesus christ 
---
Rorqs are fine.
---
Remove excavators.
---
&gt; posts examples of haw titans being OP  
---
&gt; nearly all have supers as top damage except those where they had zero transversal  
---
&gt; is in TAPI
---
The last tapi/goon deployment to obe/hakonen about 1 1/2 years ago where pgls nightmare fleet got gtfod and their dreads subsequently booty blasted. 
---
Although I do not support the weaponized autism, the ideas are good. Bosons most especially are ridiculous right now, sirens are indeed what makes carriers and supers relatively dumpable on everything, GTFO are ridiculous. I don't know enough about burst projectors tho.
---
Yeah, the only good routes are via Delve, otherwise you're forced to take region gates to cross a gulf
---
The biggest change that has occurred, which you missed, is the bot explosions. 2 of them. The 1st one was at the end of 2014 / beginning of 2015, and the 2nd one after alphas and skill injectors got introduced into the game.
---
Next is the explosion of multiboxers and AFKers. These are very botlike in their behavior to a regular player and are harmful to the game in the same ways, though often to a just slightly lesser degree. In addition, the multiboxers and AFKers often become at least part-time macro / bot users which makes it impossible to tell them apart and they fiercely defend bots and are against anything that would make it harder for bots to be in the game because it encroaches on their multiboxing and AFKing. 
---
So that is the biggest thing that you missed. The percentage of actually playing and active players has severely dropped, while the percentage of bots / multiboxers / AFkers ( they're all the same shit really ) has risen drastically.
---
Omist is owned by people that live "before it" unless there are other business deals.      
---
Yeah, i'd much rather see a nerf to capitals/rorqs and just deal with goons being top dog for awhile, rather than the game continue to head into the slow heat death of meta stagnation and nearly impenetrable super umbrella's that apply to everything in the game. 
---
Goons say this everytime this comes up, along with the "little guy" argument, and at this point, I don't care if the little guy gets fucked (they're fucked already in the current meta), or Goons are "winning" for a couple years. The capital meta needs a hard slam in the nuts with a sledgehammer.
---
make them able to counter larger subcaps like battleships, but there's no reason why carriers should be able to apply DPS to frigates when some subcaps can't even do that
---
Ok I'll give it a shot
---
&gt; Did you make a habit of moving your dread across deep hostile nullsec or something?
---
Yes :|
---
tier ones tier twos tier threes
---
sounds like someone who hardly played the game
---
Guess he didn't like the loss last night...hummm he must be in TEST....or one of the Goon puppets.
---
Camp whole constellation, drop 1-2 times ... and you get paid for leaving the local. 
---
combined with max tidi its a one shot for a whole fleet of subcaps. thats a horrible mechanic to have in a game. 
---
Are you retarded or just pretending?
---
this reminds me of the time i found a gigantic black buttplug on the ADA seat in the shower in the student housing
---
in a good way
---
The trick isn't to nerf the tools to "fix the goon manace", the trick is to implement balance passes that discourage super large player groups.
---
okay that's pretty funny
---
Do stuff together, combine comms/interactions, maybe find a goal you share with all your members, take care of your content creators/FCs or whoever makes stuff happen.
---
Try to keep drama/toxicity at a minimum, try to keep the orgainsation structure flat so members have no issues talking to the highest up leaders and the other way around, no point having l33t tryhard directors and diplomats and all the fancy rolles filled with people that want to feel important when members don't feel happy.
---
wrong thread bro. this one is about capital ships. 
---
You can get all the footage you want in on day by just stepping one foot into delve with a 1-500 man hac fleet. 
---
Get dunked on shield fight, chestbeat anyway cause nobody shows on armor. oh how good must it feel to always have a dose of Kool aid at your disposal.
---
You can bomb 500 subcaps with 50 and win a battle. Proliferation doesn't mean as much because there's a wide range of counters and doctrines to choose from.
---
What are you going to do against 500 capitals except bring 600 capitals? When it comes to capitals proliferation is all that matters.
---
He is just bad.
---
That will never happen. You can't nerf Human behavior. If you limit corp size, they'll just make sister/splinter corps and fill those up.
---
I don't have an issue with Goons' organization, or that they have a lot of people. I have an issue with the fact that a single class of ship can counter 95% of the shit in the game. If you nerf the tools to not apply to everything, then they'll stop being used for everything. So it doesn't matter if you have 3000 carriers, if they all apply poorly to small shit, then they won't be used for every engagement.
---
Again? This is almost the same as what he ranted about when he quit the game like 3 years ago. There's threads about this on /r/eve but all the links are dead. 
---
Someone made a mirror here:

---
i dont get it.
---
we are evicting them we are not purging them. they are free to evac their assets
---
Can't agree more! o7
---
 Those things are supposed to be a major milestone in a player's progression in EVE!
---
Problem is I agree, but I do not think it will really help. If you make everyones toys worthless everyone in nullsec is pissed and the status quo shifts to hoarding the new meta within a day thanks to skill injectors and rorquals online.
---
You clearly dont know how it works, you warp your fleet at titan, new spawn of npc undocks and warps on you fleet on titan, your fleet warps out, npcs reagro on titan and titan gets extra warp disruptors from npcs, and now it wont be able to rewarp on fax.
---
Sounds familiar when you think about reinforcing citadels during unanchoring.
---
Well just F1 if you group stuff.  Run some DED sites.  Cant bot those really, and can be fun and challenging when escalations lead to enemy territory.  
---
/r/iamverysmart
---
Maybe nsh should just adapt
---
&gt; Maybe he just finally accepted that the game mechanic that made test and goons strong is bad for the overall game
---
Nah PGL's been whining about how caps are OP for a loooong time
---
Alright, carry on then.
---
If you introduce resource scarcity (from overfarming) and/or making nullsec systems valuable based on their truesec (meaning lower quality nullsec is actually garbage) then you force the larger groups to decide who gets the good space and who doesn't. Boom, conflict.
---
When last time have you tried  to move uncompressed ore and capital parts?           
---
Some things you need to build. 
---
Hope so. Was getting tons of app crashes before. 
---
Reckon this war will be longer/shorter than the war on Horde/Geminate?
---
TEST logic best logic
---
If you are not aligned in titan you are doing it wrong.    
---
You need to tackle titan first. 
---
if they cost a lot they'll be balanced for sure
---
&gt; Capitals arent too big a deal
---
Yes they are. Not in general, but on some sweet spots they are.
---
Nah, the post came out late, next weekend for sure
---
&gt;  other alliances playing the same game are winning left and right with the same tools everyone has
---
Please prove this point because I'm not seing any alliance winning anything without capital dominance.
---
If Tidi would get reduced 1% for every time a narcissist cries out loud on r/Eve, we would have fucking smooth Cap-battles all over New Eden.
---
because this isn't a SOTA.
---
Ohhhh yeah.... Bring me those ores real good!!! *u*
---
This hasing for good heat does. I can has for make Pylon for all prots, but then we cant do
---
Anyone got the video of that NCPL dreadbomb eating shit by the trillions?
---
o7
---
Really simple solution:
---
Delete PANIC
---
Delete skill injectors.
---
All other mechanics are not in an absolutely terrible state. Skill injectors have been the driving force behind everything-proliferation, and rorquals are the driving force behind everything-cheap.
---
Remember when it took 6 months for people to train a basic super toon? Haha these were the good days. 
---
Skill injectors are fucking eve to death. 
---
TFW: a horrific unthought cashgrab ruins a game. Feels a little bit like BDO for some reason...
---
he was sitting at the star trying to figure out what a kiki was and figuring out if he should engage him or not when the kiki warped in on him and forced the issue. as the other commenter said he just follows the suggestions we made about blaster boats and got in under his guns, and orbited tight. 
---
was hilarious because he linked the kill in corp chat and still had no idea what the killed i almost spat my coffee all over my desk.
---
Stop embarrassing yourself and stop writing.
---
&gt;i lost to these things i hate, plz remove
---
Downvote button isn’t for disagreeing. It’s how we show your post adds nothing to the discussion. 
---
so you're saying back home in two weeks then?
---
lol if only that were the case 
---

---
They are broken and need nerfing. 
---
I noticed I was ghost training as alpha, it did stop training after a day or 2 I think, server may check your status at downtime and pause your skill queue then if no omega? 
---
I had a skill completed a few hours before the omega ran out and then it continued to train the next skill, which is how ghost bug used to work I believe? 
---
Prove you can read first? Where did i say anything about capital dominance? 
---
:dinobrain:
---
&gt; What are you going to do against 500 capitals except bring 600 capitals?
---
Just go around the caps (unironically). The Initiative has done this to great success.
---
Yeah caps aren't _terrible_, the problem is you're fighting 100 of them where previously you'd have fought 10-20.
---
I was doing this Last night thinking to myself "I have become everything I hate"
---
Not chest beating, just wanted a fight.
---
I mean, what was he expecting?
---
A titan module that removes a subcap fleet from the grid and tackles them for a minute.
---
tbh I prefer to move through hostile null than dumb hunted lowsec regions, at least nullsec residents leave my cynos alone
---
The core problem is their dominance over subcaps, with the result that all content is capital content. N+1 supercaps is also tapigons biggest strength, and anyone who actually plays the game knows that supers and caps are oppressive as fuck.
---
Losing subcap fights should matter. 
---
In my defense it was 5am
---
just make them cost as much as a palpatine keepstar
---
conservation of effort states that we should just give the palpatine keepstar a jump drive
---
Supers are an entire small gang nowadays with what you can do with them :)
---
after making the original post, I switched to EveNova and deleted droid, now I'll have to add it again! Grrr (but also yay moar choice)

Lol here come the armchairs.

News @ 11:
---
Triglavian ships fighting the carrier/rorq menace. Living Breathing Fuel Blocks pilot convinced that "DrugsDen &gt; been a gf without your fleet of over powered joke ships"
---
https://br.inyour.space/?s=4685&amp;b=8456520&amp;e=150&amp;t=ub
---
Proof that Krabs want Triglavian rebalanced, so that they cannot be brought to the pwnzone day after day. Their inability to fight off pico gangs warriors with capital sized vessels is unfair to them, and unbalanced. Krabs outcry together at CCP, and think they should fix the game so the spod brain rules over all.
---
If you have 500 people and get countered by 60 bombers biomassing is your best balance option bud. 
---
How about we fix Rorquals, Panic and skill injectors.
---
Rorquals and thier spam allow for the  capital proliferation we see today. Roll things back and make Rorqs what they should be, a boosting ship. Remove thier massive bonus to mining as that was never suppossed to be thier role. 
---
Make panic act like an ADC and boost resistances for a set period of time or boosting ability. Invulnerability makes them too safe in the hands of a semi capable pilot with any allies.
---
i had no idea how much i wanted this until now
---
God damn it there is a reason we don't let wally play with his keyboard 
---
That helps spread them out and yes, create conflict. It does not however change anything in the meta.
---
Capitals will still be the #1 ship class in the game to drop on anything roaming around and apply to them. So what if they're spread out more, if they can still just undock their caps, or cyno in some reinforcements.
---
You can say "well they'll own more space and it'll be harder to seed caps everywhere". Yeah, for maybe a month. I'm no nullsec/alliance member, but i can certainly say the amount of capitals in the game, and the amount owned by goons is staggering. Just based off the minerals being mined and the amount of caps i see daily. It would not take long for them (or any large null group for that matter) to spread those out everywhere, have them in corp hangars so people just hop in one and cyno in to save their rorq/ratters.
---
Once the dust settles with the "resource scarcity", we'll still be in the same boat as we are now. The organized groups will move with their super/capital blob and just smite anything that gets in their way as they gobble up resources to maintain their power.
---
Nerfing the ability for their supers/carriers to counter nearly everything would help neuter their ability to form roaming death squads of capitals and leave them exposed to more subcap counters.
---
&gt;  There are mechanics that could use a tweak, maybe, but those aren't what progod is complaining about.
---
Bosons, fighters being efficient at everything, GTFO beign ridiculous for TiDi fights, HAW titans shitting on BC and BS without an issue ? Mechanics that are supposed to be marginal but have ridiculous impact now. Capital proliferation wouldn't be an issue if they weren't the solution for everything.
---
&gt; Progod only has a problem with mechanics that make it harder for him to N+1 everything with subcaps. Coincidentally, N+1 subcaps is TAPI's biggest strength.
---
TEST focus has been to focus heavily on getting their supers and caps fleet up to a serious size which it is now. Yet he is asking for supers nerfs ...
---
&gt;based on their truesec
---
Good thing we occupy some of the choicest space in the game in that regard!
---
Come now, let's not pretend ya'll weren't phone for last night but instead went to kill the darkness titan when it fail jumped.
---
Also, rote is a bunch of retirees. Active count is a better count of alliance size.
---
also disgusting how they can launch bubbles, do more dps than a dread at any range with no siege, use fighters that point and web with no penalty to the fitting, and have a warp core strength of 25 :)
---
I literally downloaded it yesterday and promptly deleted it since it crashed 6 times in 2 minutes.  Guess I'll give it another whirl
---
We all know spies don't wake up till at least 11am, so you should have been fine.
---
Lore wise it's a binary system. However due to Legacy Code star systems in EVE can't actually have two stars. So this is what you get.
---
It's also kind of funny that j-space has tons of binary and other strange star systems but there's not a single binary star system in all of k-space. Imagine if Amamake had a wormhole-like effect?
---
YES
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EXxkd\_8pi0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EXxkd_8pi0)
---
damn, nice job Atron pilot!
---
Excuse me but what "winning" are you talking about then ?
---
Hey, that too sounds familiar when I recall certain group getting their keepstar reffed during unanchoring
---
I mean I don't actually care that much that it gets leaked
---
Open questions regarding their sexuality usually helps... Start foolish and rather interesting talks about the promiscuity of woman around their places (because they might be from other countries, so cultural shit and stuff is interesting).
---
Avoid religious and political crap like it was the plague... And if by some reason someone do not get your joke regarding classical cold war crap, you just stay silent and let it all blow over &gt;.&gt;
---
&gt;I remember when PL went south to Curse and extended Provi deployment, it was strictly a subcap deployment, yet every fight Test was involved with, multiple super caps and caps were used
---
Yeah because super caps and caps are OP and works :P
---
PGL specializes in subcap stuff, and he's been complaining about caps for a looong time. He's not a hypocrite for not stopping Test from taking advantage of caps in the name of justice and balance, that's just plain impractical.
---
Depends on how long it takes Rexchancellor Vily to apologize or whatever
---
This is the way to significantly nerf rorquals and make sure they still see use outside of combat.
---
Good, more useless features that will blow up the server
---
"We're not happy until you're content." First time seeing that, and best pun of the bunch. A+
---
TIL you could decloak with the burst projector!
---
Nice one
---
&gt; How about we fix Rorquals, Panic and skill injectors.
---
Never going to happen because CCP isn't going to nerf what is making money. Capital proliferation isn't there anyway so might as well nerf the things that make them oppressive as hell right now (bosons / fighters being the best tool for anything)
---
6 years
---
Trust me guys, the dreadbomb will work against supers
---
Reset Tranquility
---
It has two main issues: 1) takes fuckton of time 2) is dumb easy to spot. Compare that to any wormhole-based (or just gating-based) mobility of whatever non-battleship subcap fleet you choose (reminder T3Cs can be easily refit for hypers/agility travel mode) and you can see the difference. Sure, ship caches kind of circumvent that, but those are limited to regular caps only, difficult to set up and very prone to being scouted by spies.
---
Only reason why it's not exploited is not due to cap vs. subcap balance being skewed, but due to timer mechanics making it hard to abuse subcap mobility, with how much heads up there is and how vulnerability windows work, any kind of high map mobility is almost unusable outside few very rare cases like full scale invasion. Caps/supers just shine in timer-based trench warfare, so trying to fight that way will make them seem unfair; sad that trench warfare is likely the only viable way to fight wars now.
---
The warp probe itself can decloak.  The “beacon” that shows in space 10 seconds before the probe does not.   
---
Well, I guess half of what I meant is close enough
---
Spod bookmarks?
---
I like to believe they're allowing Capital proliferation to continue so they can then run some massive live events. Perhaps a return of the Serpentis Solteur in a large scale invasion of the Empires, or even an Empire-lead attack on the Drifters that's met with such massive resistance that the Ipetans and perhaps even the Amarr Emperor would be required to stem the tide of angry Drifters.
---
This is all from a mostly uninformed lore standpoint and wishful thinking, no doubt others have voiced these thoughts... but it would still be cool to see more Eve storyline unfolding outside our little capsuleer bubbles.
---
You mean ... he was *planning* this thread all along?  What a propaganda mastermind.
---
Loki’s was a great game that play for a bit and then it would go back out again but I gotta is a fun way of playing with the other teams 
---
I'm actually fine with jump gates.  Pop the ihub and they die for 35 days.
---
No, then you just have 90% of the game living out of hisec again. 
---
Farms and fields was the first and only thing CCP ever did that actually worked to get people out of hisec and into the conflict zones of low/nul/wormholes.
---
The idea of certain prequirements for skins is interresting, but i doupt it will happen. It simply excludes too many people who are willing to draw their credit cards...
---
Also, it wouldn't be that much of an achivement because most players would just gank their alts in rookie ships until they can claim the bragging rights with that skin. What would render it kind of worthless for those who have put real effort into it.
---
Solid idea. Fuck caps and supers. Subcap wars were much more fun.
---
That is a good enough excuse for me.  
---
Carriers are kind of presented as anti-small craft, anti-support capitals, so ability to deal with small support ships like frigates, destroyers, maybe recons feels fine. And I actually don't like caps being so effective against mainfleet doctrines (battleships, command ships, T3Cs, HACs), capital way of dealing with mainfleets should've always been HAW dreads - which have their own share of issues, especially when used in larger fights (like having to commit to siege).
---
Have a concrete plan for what you want to do.
---
Nothing worse than being in a 'We do a bit of everything' corp, where nothing ever happens.
---
&gt; Not in general, but on some sweet spots they are.
---
For example, when an incompetent Legacy FC warps a full Ferox fleet to an unscouted gate and gets the whole fleet bosoned to smithereens (which is what triggered pgl)
---
I heard this joke somewhere before..... 
---
Which is absolutely right.  Who doesn't want to see buffs for dreads?  (Maybe take away HAW guns at the same time).
---
I believe they're allowing capital proliferation to continue because it's funding a lot of subbed alts and injector sales. 
---
to be fair, that wallymarts guy shit talks enough for both guilds
---
&gt;Delete skill injectors
---
It's almost like we knew this would happen when they were announced. They allow for ridiculous capital proliferation, and makes replacing banned bots almost free.
---
&gt; N+1 subcaps is TAPI's biggest strength.
---
Pretty much this IMO.
---
Eh, I've moved carriers and dreads in perfect safety for 9,5 years now.
---
&gt; Coincidentally, N+1 subcaps is TAPI's biggest strength.
---
We're regularly outnumbered by horde and the North.  Not every time, but I'd say more often than not.
---
Those boosh raven fleets are almost impossible to fight in subcaps as well 
---
You're probably right... but nonetheless....
---
You shut your filthy clam and let me live in my dream world!
---
lol
---
I read this and thought "people are going to spurge about rorquals and cap building in the comments" -- yep
---
No more tears, only dreams dude.
---
Can you imagine a keepstar bumping lol
---
There’s a difference between ‘people will do this’ and ‘we want people to do this’. Instead of making it a challenge for people to form larger and larger player groups CCP has gone the route of enabling and making it easier. ACLs, increased corp sizes, at every turn CCP opens the door to this, instead of expecting players to put in the effort. I wouldn’t care if there was GSF 1 2 and 3 as alliances, it would be more interesting than what we have now if there was genuine effort required.
---
Just delete Tranquility and start over in 2009.
---
&gt;3) Remove all Burst projectors
---
fun fact, 24% of all doomsdays fired for the previous 2 years happened at that battle
---
Amarr caps are all pretty ugly besides Rev and Avatar 
---
If the boosh fleet has more subs to support it than you do to attack it, sure. Otherwise its merely very difficult to fight in subs, but definitely not impossible. Chemo, boosh Rokhs, and even mass cormorants that focus on head shotting booshers are all methods of hurting the comp, though they all require that you have reasonable control of the subcap grid to make use of them. If you're badly outblobbed, only the first can really work... if you're lucky.
---
\^this, soo much this
---
\+15 years of balancing +300 subcaps, there is enough play and counterplay for an amazing game
---
Just plant 100 astras simple Farmers style.
---
It's not reasonably possible to remove a determined enemy.
---
He quit yonks ago.
---
+++
---
Remember when they were going to add that to keepstars...
---
Where did he recommend the removal of capital remote repair?
---
Not a fan but, PGL is right ...
---
No suggestion to remove fax tho :thinking:
---
Truthhhhh
---
Michael Wilmore for president
---
If he quit 3 years ago... it's pretty accurate. It was rough going back then. Lots of changes since then.
---
winning fights? objectives? as in taking stuff and destroying stuff with or without capitals? if ur trying to tell me that nothing gets done without capitals, just look at some of the brs posted in this sub in the past 2 weeks. as for opponents being shit, that's not really a reason to change the game now, is it?
---
This team has insideing. I hadnt made for it
---
Yeah that’s what kind a like you think of it a little guy and then you should go get back with him a bit more of it and you can do something.
---
Literally the only thing I looked for on the km.
---
Two possibilities:
---
1: Make less players viable in a system:
---
* Add a delay between Havens respawn (technically, add a delay for all combat sites, but especially havens since people farm those in VNIs).
---
* Add a **large** delay between mining sites respawn, and/or make it that you cannot trigger the site despawn, forcing people to clean all the worthless rocks.
---
* Maybe don't respawn the sites in the same system, but rather make respawn constellation/region wide, to dilute people around? (And no respawn in the same system if no free anom slot, you must go clear something somewhere else to have it respawn here.)
---
2: Make smaller groups more viable:
---
* Have resources dwindle over time, forcing a more nomadic game style.
---
'delete all force multipliers so my big blob can always win'
---
:ok\_hand:
---
Throwing shade a lot when you are literally the epitome of a faggot yourself
---
Even when him had for it has dont out pouring. Even arms open
---
Just turn all the fax into carriers, game is fixed
---
I'm more than a little mad that no one has commented on my telestrator thing :(
---
Free skill injectors? Could you elaborate? 
---
Too late 😂
---
Just have goons and test unsub until the changes are made. Either the changes get applied, or no more tapirium.  win win. 
---
Shaka, when the walls fell. Temba, with arms open. Darmok and Jarad, at Tanagra.
---
Makes sense
---
Not at all. It's under delve and left of Stain in the map. Think of how Tenal is to Venal.
---
Is the Hunter from island make happy inside plant for girl to drink?
---
all of null-sec is infested with bots, no-one denies that
---
however claiming that drone lands is some kind of botter safe haven and people are actively protecting them is nonsense, almost as dumb as the suggestion that some npc space would shut down bots
---
fact is rent lords or ordinary players don't have the time and patience to go through every system and constantly check for bots, just because there are bots in their space does not mean they are complicit or encouraging those bots. some of the reasons bots do not get removed by players more often: 
---
* it's a game people play for fun
---
* it's not directly rewarding, you will not catch them
---
* you may get false positives because you lack the appropriate tools and back end access
---
* it should be dealt with by ccp
---
a single gm with teleportation and hide from local tools could remove tens of bots a day with reasonably low false positives, but this either doesn't occur or occurs rarely enough that no-one notices
---
It for jump can test LMAO, for big man sleep on street nice air in city!!!!
---
So what you mean is, goons and TEST quit EVE and there is lots of free space, just make sure they send me all their citadels first thanks
---
Mostly because out of game tools are bad, because the developer misunderstood how the skill queue worked.
---
The SP in a skill doesn't tick up in the api, until the queue changes. So it has to be calculated. (This is efficient. ticking everything up would be inefficient. It's why PI works in a similar way)
---
I'm about as interested participating in a "reddit war" with PGL as I am in working with him in any other capacity. Yeah there are things CCP could do to help the health of the game - IMO though, TAPI becoming actually independent from GOONS and breaking up the biggest bloc of pilots in the game would probably be more impactful and healthy for the game. 
---
Tell us how you really feel
---
Slamming both goons and test? Who do you think will be left to upload this on /eve? :P
---
Wormholers maybe
---
FC, I would like to buy...
---
* What Is rapid light missiles
---
* What are sensor dampners

For 500 please. 
---
+1
---
Yes because we don't have titans bosoning everything they can. Titans camping gates and WH because hey, what's the beautiful art of bombing if a titan can do it anyway right ? Maybe PGL is triggering over the fact he got caught by a boson he could have dodge, it doesn't mean bosons, GTFO or fighters are not to be looked at.
---
Rote Kapelle - yikes
---
how does wolf rayet benefit the legion in way that it doesn't also benefit a loki
---
Well, subcaps, except for when PL used caps a bunch...
---
You can use a tool and also believe that tool is broken, because not using the tool puts you at a severe disadvantage. Especially when it’s against PL, since PL lost their honorabru subcap card years and years ago.
---
No u
---
got me
---
There's already a delay between havens respawning, and there's a five hour delay between colossal anoms in a solar system. A single solar system can, at most, sustain 10 rorquals mining indefinitely. Or, at least that was what I came up with at the time of the change. I forget if CCP nerfed rorqs/excavators even more since then.
---
Is this holy war starting now or after you ate shit for 3 month? And will there be dread-srp?
---
Lots of people were excited about rorqs but in their current state, they are absolutely killing the game.
---
Gordon I didn't know you played eve?!?!?
---
I’m sorry, blobbing doesn’t mean you’re superior lmao
---
This is the reply every nullbear posts when someone posts something scary that will nerf their farms. Maybe it did get them out of hisec but the player behavior has made large swaths of nullsec safer than highsec.

Add special haw tracking rigs that would make them work. 
---
Not going to fix every problem but it would force people to make a meaningful decision about the role of their ship. 
---
Where exactly do I say we’re superior at any point in that post?
---
The main point is that of any alliance in EVE, PL has the least right to complain about getting supers dropped on them because that was essentially their entire strategy for years when fighting anything from solo roamers to full on battles.
---
They'll never delete skill injectors now. But they should limit them to a few per month or whatever. Enough to grab a quick train or shuffle some SP, but not enough to make RMT isk and Injectors the best way to get into the game in 2019.
---
anything to be relevant kiddo!
---
You dont need to bot those you can do them half afk with drone ships.

Hi, I have an example for you. My fourth video, "Six if Spades - Shadows" has double point of view synchronised footage from perspective of TEST sub-capital fleet. Both recordings are from Basilisk logistics perspective, from a fight in C-LTXS on 20th May, 2018, when XiX were evacuating their home. The footage is I remained on grid, while other part of the feet, including the footage of my logistics pilot - did got GTFO'ed 18.4 AU away from the battle. Time stamps in this video for that fight is starting from 02:36 to 07:05. In this time slot for this fight, double point of view footage takes the majority compared to cinematics, and they all have broadcasts, watchlist, modules, and all locked targets (part of UI) visible. Comms in this clip are not disjointed from the time of video which is sped up to compensate TiDi. https://youtu.be/u_F9wJHmo6M
---
The grid of battle had no citadel structures, friendly or hostile, and you can even see a Titan, spooling up the GTFO, from 03:50 to 04:05, at the top center of the screen in this video clip.
---
Do you have amnesia? I’ve pointed out in this thread that we had a strict subcap deployment lmao 
---
You must know so much about PL, please tell me more :^ )
---
I seccond that...this is not DnD
---
2 Eagle fleets too stronk, must tether immediately.
---
Iron had other plans last night. Also if you didn't know, Iron and Snuff do not like each other.
---
Your fight was during the time when we were killing the titan. The titan was 4 mids away. Even if we didn't want to kill the titan we wouldn't have been able to make it to the fight in time since we are deployed 3 mids from solitude.
---
I'm talking about an incorrect value represented in game on the character sheet.     
---
    
---
For instance say I log in and try to extract because my out of game tool says I should be at 5.6M SP. I activate the skill extractor and get an error message saying I need 5.5M or more to extract. Sure enough, the in game character sheet says 5.1M. If I pause and unpause the queue it will then correctly represent the 5.6M SP and allow me to extract.     
---
I was aware that the SP has to be calculated for out of game (but only because I tried to make my own SP farm google sheet with GESI and promptly gave up after getting to that point.)
---
It was a good idea
---
This is not the first time.. 
---
Going from Delve to Deklein in 14 jumps isn't the fault of jump bridges, it's the fault of massive galaxy-spanning regional gates. Not using jump bridges would increase the travel time involved here by 12 minutes and a single 5LY capital jump's worth of fatigue.
---
just adapt
---
Man, I can only imagine how hard it is having to choose between REE PGL and REEEE CAPITALS
---
Which regional news outlet will this be broadcast on?
---
PK used it on Co2/TEST when they'd set up a blob on a gate in 15w. They never recovered.
---
&gt; no reason why carriers should be able to apply DPS to frigates 
---
**bzzzt**  wrong direction, we need more counterplay not less. Make bombers do 4x-10x damage to fighters and caps. Make ABCs do the same. make marauders bastion do the same with damage reduction from fighters/HAWs. Suddenly dropping 10-20 supers isn't auto-win in any subcap brawl and you have counterplay.
---
I'd also increase cap model sizes and tell people to stfu about bounces. now you need subcap grid control, or multiple cynos and warpins to protect caps and cant just warp a whole fleet into one tether spot. 
---
I don’t work for the government. 
---
It's probably related, tbh.
---
The SP isn't applied until the skill finishes training, or the queue is restarted.
---
Yes and yes. 
---
This is the kind of shitpost I was expecting from the corp
---
Thats one way, if you dont already have fatigue, if you already have a titan in position. Its the ease of casual movement that is the issue.
---
lol just bring 100 dreads
---
I’m fine with all of these changes. Especially since I keep dying to Frat bosons. 
---
That's probably it. I will keep a closer eye next time I go to extract and see if the numbers support that.
---
You know the phrase "It's better to stay silent and let people think you are stupid, than it is to open your mouth and remove all doubt"?
---
This is that.
---
&gt; ...take care of your content creators/FCs or whoever makes stuff happen.
---
This. Don't try to do all by yourself, you will burn out very quickly.
---
&gt; we're going to focus on the simplest most glaring issues that would at least get some daily content back into this game
---
Nerfing the n+1 game?
---
First of all, how dare you? Destiny was an apex capsuleer as evidenced by notable losses such as this...
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/36951235/
---
Bombing runs are hard to get right to annihilate that amount of people. If you can kill 200+ people ins 60 bombers, it's not embarrassing for the losing fleet, it's an impressive skill for the bombers. Everything has to work right in a good bombing run. 
---
&gt; They allow for ridiculous capital proliferation
---
gotta love seeing day old titan pilots. 
---
You missed that shot bro
---
CCP used to andvertise with "build your own empire"  for years now and yet its supposed to be "build your own useless empire"?
---
Thats Not going to work 
---
just bring 10 reppy boiz
---
The literal epitome of loney
---
This is a meaningful discussion? R/eve has those?
---
Looks like your caching redis worker pool died. If it’s the public facing pathfinder, you’ll have to wait for Exodus to either figure out if it was a memory/config error. (If he doesn’t just reboot)
---
Good luck.
---
You do kinda look like a young John Madden, so it fits. 
---
It's the same things that fucked over the NCPL deployment down south a year ago. When those problems fuck over all sides then something is clearly wrong. 
---
wanna debate?
---
this was posted in 2015 and he quit even before that so these are pretty old takes
---
I think it will be on his Twitch Channel?
---
Why are we still talking about destiny? He's toxic to every scene he gets into, and this coming from an old school Sc2 fanboy 
---
Normally on a strict subcap deployment you don’t use caps.
---
\&gt;nullbear
---
ok well your opinion isnt worth anything then lol
---
&gt;I'm declaring Jihad, please help if you can 
---
idk why but that line had me laughing.
---
Also, what is a Siren?
---
What happened to cause this sudden and recent outcry from you?
---
RoI per region should exponentially scale back depending on how much you farm. 
---
This means, alliances who arent tapping their regions hard enough still get a chance to grow while those who are tapping the hell out of it have to spread out alot. 
---
This is why you post before you drink. 
---
it doesn't help that they are unironically 0.2 buttons per minute *before* tidi. People that want to get titans to do anything but bridge can't possibly be doing it for the pvp
---
In case this isn't bait, I really appreciate this. Nullsec is certainly not what it used to be; I miss being able to undock and not having supers dropped on me in 9/10 regions. I miss having ways to force people to undock. 
---
In the end we know nothing will change but why stop trying.
---
Here let me help you since you have conveniently left it out.

He got dunked on by capitals a few times.
---
I swear if I see one more cosmic sig starting with RAW I'm gonna fukin lose it
---
Yet again CCP advertises with the empire building Thing so this wont change as its one of the biggest sellers for eve. Thats what attracted a lot of people to be Part of a huge Group to fight large battles So even if they kill the empires we will end up with another round of batphones online.
---
Also the nomadic Part will cause more harm then good. Just imagine for a second if little ass Group owns a pocket in lets say kavela and suddenly kavela becomes the most valuable Region guess whats going to Happen? Right! Goons TEST Pl right at their doorstep fighting a war the Group didnt ask for and smashing that Group into the ever loving void.

---
&gt; All of you have opinions, 99.9% of them are wrong, but you deserve the opportunity to find that out the hard way.
---
http://i.imgur.com/qePp4Vs.gif
---
The problem I have is that you *need* rapid lights or specific ewar hard counters just to deal with them. That essentially turns fights into "bring this or lose" which is inherently uninteresting in terms of piloting. A lot of this would be helped by a massive tracking nerf which would allow more piloting counterplay by getting under guns--right now you literally cannot do that, and they have 400% of the tracking speed of literally any other similarly projecting system. Unless you outblob or get specifically bonused hulls like the Lach it is virtually impossible to close scram range on a Drekavac even in stuff like interceptors.
---
Essentially the goal of this split is to remove this brawl-class tracking at skirmish range and to preserve it within the shortrange for pilots that do make use of it at closer ranges. This is still good for anticapital applications and introduces the viability of trig brawling while making the long range variant of trig hulls a more interesting piloting game at subcap vs. subcap.
---
This *demotes* blob play on both sides and increases skill both flying and flying against these ships.
---
Similarly my trig logi pass is designed to improve them at the small gang scale (obv irrelevant to solo) and demote blob play. It cuts the ramp-up time to a few cycles and makes smaller numbers of logi much better than overblobbing logi. You still get your range and your drones, but it means that blob logi, especially afk logi in a gatecamp is not as viable. If there is more than one of you it is more rewarding to be a skilled logi which reps at appropriately staggered moments.
---
I agree with you exactly. This is why I'm trying to demote the utility of these hulls in blob vs blob or spod brain piloting.
---
I guess we are playing pre-RMR in the age before jump clones.
---
But yeah OK.
---
As if anyone gives a fuck what that pedophile thinks.
---
I will debate you on twitch
---
The current stagnation in game is because two biggest coalitions in game have decided they'd rather blue up. 
---
Who's bringing the "Hot wings"?
---
I got cancer from reading this. Can you rephrase your point? It sounds like you are saying that supercap umbrellas only exist as a deterrent to keep hostiles from escalating to cap fights in your own space.
---
You can disprove your own argument by going roaming in an assfrig gang for an hour, tackling a rorq and then getting the absolute shit dropped out of you. That happens without you ever threatening to escalate beyond the frig hulls.
---
make excavators only usable by assigning them to hulks. one to one. so for every rorqual in use, you need five hulks. bring rorquals back to being the fleet boosters they used to be.
---
for 200 euro its  a little boss! all new games are shitty anyway so not like im missing anything
---
So your tactic to bring 500 dudes was out played by teather,   and your... mad?   Makeing fun of them? Hopeing to shame them into feeding you?  
---
 Unless this is an illustration of pgls  "capitals too stronk" manifesto?  
---
Please shitpost more clearly for those of us still trying to get enough caffeine into our bloodstream to graduate from walking dead to mostly human.
---
   Kthnksbai  :)
---
You do realise he is still part of the biggest capital and super capital force in the game?
---
just bring
---
What triggered this? :thinking:
---
Before you declare a reddit campaign.. we should talk. 
---
 Politiks too stonk.   CCP nerf plz.   
---
Kthnksbai
---
Hey it was national
---
We made so much money on drifter incursions. Used AB Crucifiers to damp the Drifters and killed with drones. Made 45 mill per site, site time of 5 min. So 540 mill an hour in T1 frigs. The DD's killed us sometimes but our fits were so cheap that it didn't matter, just hop into another and come on back. 
---
They outnumbered us .. not including the caps. By 2 fleets I was saying 2 independent fleets, not full.
---
I dualboot Win 10/Ubuntu and have not made the switch to gaming on Linux yet. My corpmates tell me it's stable at the cost 5 fps.
---
Yeah like, who cares about big metagame dominance. It would just be nice to have interesting fights without localised 'I win buttons'. Everyone uses and abuses it, and everyone would benefit from it being changed. 
---
pbuh
---
So what until there is not a single kill on zkill without a capital we shouldn't look at capital balance ? What's current day skirmish and fights going on about ? Rorquals, supers. Anything else is not achievable, the rest is either on the extrem scope of mostly empty NS space, or in LS. Sov warfare, not going very far. Structures, against supers not going to happen. We've seen countless large alliance deployments just not working, because once you try to achieve anything valuable (structures or sov), you can't achieve it. We're seing it against recently, but it's a several year long trend. All that have been achieved on a grand scale what with supers, or because one of the opponent collapsed on their own failure.
---
So if you look out of that "large alliance warfare" scope, or at the only thing large alliance can achieve, but also what small entities, wormholers, NPC NS people can achieve : roaming, ganking, rorquals, carriers and supers. And unless you're going for dude not doing the proper things to defend themselves or not in range of defense (so renters). Outside of that, you're guarantee to see supers being dumped upon you. Now this would not be that big of an issue if supers were not so oppressive against subcaps. Fighters application and utility is just far too efficient, bosons are almost blindly use to kill subcaps because it's so easy to do (unlike bombers who are comparable in effect). What's wrong with saying these are issues ? What's wrong with saying GTFO is stupid if used during TiDi ?
---
&gt;  as for opponents being shit, that's not really a reason to change the game now, is it?
---
My point was to not use shit groups (Gotg / DRF) as example of what you can be "achieve" in the current balance. Because by definition, they are shit.
---
pretty much this
---
Yet every change he proposed are things he happens to have lost a fight to.
---
so its now a two front war?
---
never invade CCP in the winter.
---
"Build your own Empire"
---
That's rich. How many new "Empires" are built now? When a new person posts on reddit on what to do, or how to start their own corp, its almost always met with "Join Goons, Horde, TAPI etc". 
---
So instead of "build your own empire", they should advertise it as "Help build their Empire!"
---
It's ok. Let's just blame the guy who wasn't even there and had no intention of being there.
---
Nope a straight 1v1. We had just finished altering his fit the day before so he could online the third blaster and discussing blaster mechanics in general.
---
He got under the kiki's guns but it was still applying damage, he said he got out with 10% structure.

---
I really like pgl.. But this one made me lol hardly 😂😂😂
---
Yea sure its better to kill it with hundreds of caps, i am sorry for salt but i am seeing exact comment under every idea post
---
 See what I mean?   Clear shitposting would only help prove your point?  
---
Capitals are the only counter to being blobbed, and not even a good one. 
---
With legacy as one of the three largest coalitions, blue to the largest one the only thing holding them back is groups being able to us caps in their own space.
---
 I agree with your points / ideas (or at least what we've seen) but :
---
&gt; 1) You can debate me if you wish live on Twitch. All of you have opinions, 99.9% of them are wrong, but you deserve the opportunity to find that out the hard way.
---
That's a good way to receive shit for no purpose.
---
Do your own holy war then.
---
Wait did they just introduce that? Patch link please
---
&gt; Losing subcap fights should matter.
---
That is something you won't achieve by nerfing caps, and in fact it will probably strenghten even more use of subcap fleets you don't mind losing. Most effective subcap fleets to use when dealing with caps are stuff like HACs, T3Cs, command ships - when properly fit and piloted; and managing to lose entire HAC/T3C fleet is both expensive and very hard to quickly come back from - thanks to build times and more limited supply of materials. Best way to deal with those doctrines is any kind of garbage spam - throwing large number of T1 BC, T1 BS etc. and trading kills knowing you have advantage of quicker, easier and less expensive rebuild. Coincidentally, caps work wonders quickly cleaning up whatever random T1 garbage is being thrown at them, and any significant nerf to capitals means you get even more results out of T1 spam, meaning you have even more fleets where losing them doesn't matter.
---
&gt; dronelands has the least bots of any region
---
was the part I was replying to primarily. anyone who roams your renter space will know that you have as many and more bots than plenty of other areas in eve.
---
and yeah, ccp is shit at dealing with these things, it would be piss-easy for a teleporting/local-hiding GM account to verify bots and ban them, but that doesn't happen
---
Well its Not easy but again the advert didnt promise you that it will be easy but its definetley doable.
---
There are New alliances going up every now and then some learn that politics and friends are usefull and survive and some dont and fall pretty quick.
---
And yes joining existing empires works as strategy aswell takes time and dedication though but for Sure there is a whole lot to learn from these groups. 
---
/u/respaaaaaj
---
A small gang should be able to kill an atron, the fact that you can just drop them on everything that moves as an instant win button is ruining this game.
---
&gt; I miss being able to undock and not having supers dropped on me in 9/10 regions.
---
You're wrong. You got supers on 5/10 regions only, because the rest are completely empty.
---
[ ](just)
---
Not to speak of, thats its increasingly hard to counter the PLEX-Market fuckup that was created by making Multibox-Nullsec-PvE the absolute and by very far fotm-method to generate ISK and Ore for Caps.
---
That caused pvp-averse people with lots of online time to inflate from maybe 3 to 30 Accounts (the people that grind for their ISK and buy PLEX from the ingame market) while in the same time lots of pvp-focused guys, low-sec-dwellers that got kicked in the nuts with Lifeblood and Vets that feel trolled by CCP skilling years for big toys and now seeing totaly clueless people sitting in a fully injected range of Titan/Super/Rorqual-Chars unsub their accounts and stopped supplying the ingame market with PLEX (as these guys hate grinding and spent RL money on ISK).
---
sorry, he ment the most glaring issue the mega blobs have, not the general game

That's why I'm willing to die on that cross for you.  Someone has to

Never argue with an idiot,   they will just drag you down to their level,  and then beat you with experiance.     
---
:p   
---
I'm pretty sure there are less retarded and more productive way to achieve that.
---
That is exactly the problem, dude.
---
You need rapid lights, ewar, or blob to shut these down. It's hard counters or nothing against a weapons system that tracks like an autocannon at 45km. So let me counter by asking you...
---
FC I would like to buy...
---
* What is spiralling
---
* What is being transversal matched
---
* What is tackling the Drekavac in an interceptor
---
Dealing with this issue will let us supplement the weakness of certain hulls and give trig ships better ability to brawl with high dps and tracking, so you can take out caps even better if you are daring. We can do nice things like cut the ramp-up time to the 30s fight scale for the Damavik, even, without breaking balance.
---
Make piloting these ships interesting and skillful. Make flying against them a risk-reward game. Stop railroading conflict into a few hard solutions and calling it good.
---
Yeah lol, 9/10 inhabited regions
---
The truth hurts.
---
lol you're so butt mad
---
do you actually think there's nothing wrong with capitals in EVE circa 2019?
---
Im a new player in test (brand new Bros) it seems we are one of the only alliance's in the game who adapted. We stand alone and built an empire, but if you want to do anything outside your space you get broken caps killing my atron
---
This dumbass doesn't understand ccps business model... You aren't going to change anything, unless you become a majority shareholder.
---
You applying for the job?

Nope. That's all part of the skybox. It'd be like trying to burn to the EVE Gate.
---
~~Palatine~~ Palpatine Keepstar
---
&gt;due to Legacy Code star systems in EVE can't actually have two stars
---
Wait, seriously???
---
No. There's all kinds of things wrong with capitals. But the way that PGL is presenting this isn't doing him any favors.
---
Nope 
---
The joke
---
Moving uncompressed ore is easy. Step 1: Compress it.
---
Moving minerals or capital parts is annoying. On the other hand everyone could use them, so offering a fair buyback would be an option.

Late bloomer /u/CSMprogodlegend? :) 
---
I´d totally support your cause but sadly no footage. But let´s be honest here, CCP never really listened from what I can tell. I mean, admitting you (CCP) can´t fucking fix your own game pretty much says "Hey, I am getting paid for nothing, the community/focus groups couldn´t do better." So the playerbase needs to force CCP to change things. Only way to force them is by organising behind a common cause. So I hope you (TEST) and Goons can organise enough spin to get shit going. 
---
Fite me irl
---
why don't you shoot the fighters with your ateon 
---
I am, you seem to be not ...
---
No, but you can hire me as a consultant about how to not make shit reddit threads. Not sure if you can afford me.
---
&gt;Maybe it did get them out of hisec but the player behavior has made large swaths of nullsec safer than highsec.
---
And nerfs that attempt to limit corp/alliance size can't change that player behavior, because it's basic human behavior.  If your nerfs block something, we'll just use out-of-game tools to do it.
---
like 2 weeks ago when PGL was feeding the first dreadbomb to NCPL.  The titan blob on the fort used it against the subcap blob while extracting.
---
Killboards and BR’s are what I consider to have the biggest effect on content. Eve is to risk adverse. 
---
.01%
---
This is the perfect example of what happens when crap on the floor and can't smell it.  
---
TLDR: it still stinks.
---
Man it's going to be tough following this holy war when all your posts are hidden
---
&gt; capitals in their current state are not good for the game.
---
Just adapt and roam with dreads. 
---
Yes. But those dies when you're not one solo dude but a roaming gang with some prep.
---
I've never seen that used but ty for the pic
---
Hm, a different local where we make mention of a reddit post, arc admits off the bat it was snuff that won the fight for us, kahless talks about his small penis, and some people calling you salty.  Still not seeing the part where we talked shit like we beat you on our own.  We know we batphoned, and we know we would have been beaten without it.
---
I'll pencil you in.
---
Does the presentation matter if the arguments are valid? Just earlier you thought it was cause he whelped those dreads against PL......
---
Neither desirable.
---
Yeah but those things aren't _his problem_ so he doesn't want to 'jihad' those.
---
I look forward to someone else raising their voice against capitals.  The more the merrier.
---
Stand alone?
---
Whats his plan?  To cry endlessly about it on Reddit?
---
_Sounds like a typically solid PGL plan._
---
My allergies are acting up lately, I can't really smell anything tbh
---
He's both right and wrong.  Our subcap approach has been tilted toward blobbing for a long time, since we're one of the few entities that can consistently put enough (maelstroms/aurora nightmares/megathrons/muninns/etc) on field to alpha anything.  Vily and PGL both knew where the rorq meta was going which is why we moved to the South and set up a farms-and-fields empire away from supercapital hunters.  They pushed Test into an N+1 titan mode because it was the solution to how the game is currently balanced.  They're asking for super/titan nerfs, and getting a lot of agreement, because supers and titans and cap blobs in general are stupidly oppressive to all other forms of gameplay, not just Test's subcap blobs.
---
I would love to debate with you, but I think capitals &amp; supers are utterly broken, so it would be 2 guys just agreeing on shit :P
---
why did u not do this until you fed 300 dreads trying to kill the ships you're now arguing to nerf?
---
Thank you. 
---
"Hey let's try and fix this problem with the meta, it fucking sucks!"
---
"REEEEEEEEEE U FOLLOW THE META LIKE EVERYONE ELSE SO THAT MEANS U CAN'T PROPOSE CHANGES REEEEEEEEEE!" 
---
Lmfao. Calm your hateboner down for a second.
---
For a (presumably) smart dude, he had no idea how EVE mechanics worked. 
---
1) I said their efforts were embryonic, not the alliances themselves, get reading comprehension. That's TWO Goons who missed fifth-grade skills in this subthread.
---
2) I'm blaming CCP's mechanics, not your organization.
---
Good God, you get defensive so quickly that you don't even read.

wait what would you be hunting from thera if carriers and supers were banned?
---
Yes, why would I lie? Don't you think if EVE could natively handle two suns they would've done it instead of this weird binary skybox thing?
---
Well played
---
If we needed to take fleets from Delve to Deklein at all, why wouldn't we have a titan in place? This sort of movement doesn't happen casually, even with JBs in place.

I've been saying the exact same 4 things for 2 years, I just haven't tried to publicly berate people with it.

Actually, your post makes me wonder if a simple tweak might rebalance cap warfare immensely: make all ships booshable.  No more wrecking ball blobs being anchored in place forever. 
---
Probably a silly suggestion but it'd definitely end titan/super blob warfare and make dread bombs viable once you split up the enemy super fleet.

You. I like you.

I actually have no problem with their tactics.  Just the Sirens.

Yea I couldn’t give a fuck if they were nerfed into the ground, but that’s probably because they’re not part of my play style, and I only really come across them very occasionally when snuff or whoever are doing what they do. 
---
I wouldn’t want the null bloc guys talking about nerfing blaster merlins in ma lowsec, so I won’t do the same for their caps.

Yep. But we were drowned out by people who said "it's the same thing as the character bazaar".

Funny, we never had these proliferation issues and rapid meta shifts when we only had the bazaar :thinking:
---
You lose 3 capital battles, then start a campaign against capitals.How fitting
---
That's not realistic or feasible for any situation except outright invasion.  
---
Bullshit. Killboards and BRs are half of Eve's staying power. People that play (or pvp at least) this game like stats and records. Risk averseness is simply a by-product of the game being meaningful - whether its a win or a loss.
---
Wait a second, I just started cooking up a few runs of Siren IIs.  
---
Why does PGL hate me making ISK?
---
So some of your points are based on hypothetical modules that don't exist in game or on the test server? 
---
Do you even play this game? The whole thing is mostly a system of rock paper scissors with some skill mixed in. You are able to pick your engagements and aren't railroaded into fighting something if you don't want to. Many people in trig ships will get themselves into unfavorable, outnumbered situations to make things interesting. If you aren't flying something that is strong in the current meta you can't expect to match something that is. Your whole balance discussion seems to ignore the fact that ewar exists. I mean its not like they are as good as the cynabal used to be before the tracking enhancer nerf, they just exist to fill a gap in a lot of comps need in this time in EvE. Honestly I would fight you 5 rounds in a jackdaw vs a kikimora just to prove a point, unless I massively fuck up I'm going to dumpster you every round.

---
Pizza with ananas is considered a normal pizza
---
Yes of course, caps are definitely an issue that need to be looked at. However I don't believe that's an exclusive issue to this at hand.
---
Currently we have a long range weapons system that can track godly and given a little time, dish out Serpentis levels of dps.
---
This cuts a lot of piloting out of the equation. Ab, you're regarded as a very good slicer pilot--how much does transversal matter? Are there not entire piloting tactics like spiraling downwards that use skill to bear down transversal at long ranges against targets? You know there is and that is part of what makes fighting interesting.
---
Trig hulls literally track 400% as fast as anything comparable. That is not an exaggeration, the tracking speed is actually that good. You don't need that tracking speed to torch a carrier, but it does cut a lot of potential piloting counterplay out of the equation and reduces it to hard counters. Is that the kind of gameplay we want to promote?
---
I believe cutting this transversal speed at the long range will make skirmish fights more piloting skill dependent and allow for more counterplay options--giving breathing room for buffs like small entropic ramp up, rigs, or fitting room bonuses on the damavik.
---
apparently not
---
yeah i was confused by this as well
---
Okay

It doesn't have to be literally Deklein, it was just an example of how trivial sub movement is now.

Delegate delegate delegate. And make sure delegates can't get their hands on more than what is needed of alliance assets than is needed to do their explicit job.
---
okay maybe it was a bit silly of me to claim, but i have no reason to believe otherwise
---
both the things i said were true, and we very rarely receive reports or evidence of people botting
---
what's even more concerning is i don't think we've ever encountered people not paying on time due to being banned for botting. which if what you say is accurate then it's a pretty sad state of affairs

Kiki has terrible tank though, so while it does shit on frigs (like almost all dessied do) it can be hard countered by a single talwar.
---
The prevalence of Atrons in PvP is destroying the player-driven economy. CCP of course will do nothing as every Atron pilot is another sub they use to line their pockets, with no regard to the long term health of the game. 
---
&gt;Im a new player in test (brand new Bros) it seems we are one of the only alliance's in the game who adapted. **We stand alone** 
---
Goddammit Joe, nearly making me choke on my coffee.
---
I seriously think you are trolling now.  You can't be this clueless...  Do you not understand that this game is not about f1 blobs and you have to plan ships and fitting accordingly. Especially against ships that are nano....  I'm starting to think that you don't do any actual PVP, and your experience with triglavian ships is nil.
---
as a solo frig/cruiser player, yea, sure. however, from pearl abyss' perspective, more capitals (be it rorqs/supers/dreads, whatever) means more subs and a ton more extractors sold cause waiting to train skills in 2019 lul. i wish it'd happen but i don't see why they'd do it. if things don't change a few nano dorks are gonna rage quit the game at some point. if capital alts won't be worth it anymore they lose a (small?) fortune.
---
this is fake

it's a fake log

hey new bro, don’t fret pls cuz your new friends in brand new Bros will next time save your atron i am sure

you are literally allies with the largest coalition in the game and more than half of the playerbase, your largest enemy, PANFAM, is only about 1/4 of the game.

If you wanna look at the km's yourself: https://zkillboard.com/related/30000250/201607312000/ sides are messed up but that doesnt matter. There are a lot more killmails with titans as top damage, I only linked a few.
---
Yeah you are right their speed and sig got fucked by webs and paints and through webs their transversal also got fucked but they sure as hell werent sitting still like you can clearly see in the vid. 
---
I just dont think its good game design when you can have like 2 support ships which you cant kill because lol faxes for your HAW titans and suddenly there is a 60km deathzone around your titan blob
---
They actually do affect that.  Whaling groups using blingy comps of sleipnirs, lokis, or just cheap talos gangs can do a lot better if they're significantly more difficult to track.  Dropping the titan/super/carrier blob on them in home space while they have a rorq tackled might not be a fleet ender for the whalers in this case.
---
 You stand alone?    You blued the entire south...   and then blued the largest colition in the game...
---
Your littarly the problem with n+1   
---
The blob is the problem.

 And now the blob is crying that smaller groups of higher sp pilots who are willing to risk some of the most expensive assets in the game can still fight back? 
---
#politikstoostronk

Sadly these dusty shitlords would riot in Jita if you touch their holy cap ships now. CCP let this go on too long and now everyone and their mammy has capitals.

Those ‘empty’ regions are teeming with life. One VNI bot per haven.
---
It wasn't at Fanfest, and i didn't see any wizard hat.

And you are no Mittens.
---
But then the nyx just o7s your sabres and warps before the blob forms.
---
hmm
---
Thank you for clarifying, that makes much more sense to me now.
---
Those dreads would be just as dead with these proposed nerfs.  Not like you need HAWs on a titan to hit dreads.
---
let me tell you: the current situation is very much supporting goons and test. so you really think PGL would sacrifice the exact thing that made him and his alliance the second most powerful in the game because he is just annoyed one single time?
---
the only way panfam and other alliances can catch up if caps get a counter
---
Except nothing has changed except a modest reduction in fatigue. Hell, if you want to address subcap movement, nerf/delete wormholes; those are orders of magnitude more useful for subcap movement than JBs are.
---
We don't need no water, let the motherfucker burn  
---
Down to the ground 
---
Fair point.

Achievement should still be measured just not with killboards and BR’s.

The fighter spam was a shit ton of sirens. That would just hold down whatever they could hit from tether range. Rinse/repeat.

"National" except it was Canada so I think "regional" still applies.

Who are you? And why would Horde care to do anything you ask on their home turf?

I don't see the same courtesy extended in Delve, and I bet it wouldn't be the case in Eso.
---
You're ability and content from the telestrator will be judged completely off your ability to "accidentally" draw dongs on the board while breaking down the battle. I however am really excited to see something like you're trying to put out there. 
---
How dare they use tactics?
---
Finally something that PGL has said i can get behind.
---
and?
---
You forgot the "most battle-hardened" bit
---
Kinda yea. If you are trying to *actually* push for some kind of change, people won't take you seriously if you're a jackass about it.
---
you tell them daddy
---
Titan and Supercarrier docking bays no cost 10 plex per month to maintain  
---
Carrier and Dread now cost 1 plex.

the first 10/100 slots are 'free', the price doubles every 10/100 after that.

It's missing the mountains of isk and hundreds of supercapitals that they should clearly be surrounded by.

---

---
Fax trains are.
---
Change my mind
---
You do realize that Tapiperium have the vast subcap superiority? 
---
Tapirium reinforced the Horde Fortizar.  The onus is on you to shoot it, and on us to defend it.  If you can't figure out a way to do that with our carriers sitting on it, that's your problem, not ours.  Not to mention that you tried to blob us with main goons, liberty squad as well as your own alliance.  You let Thomas Lear face tank for you, warped in 200 KM off our carriers, fed a few Eagles and left. At least he stuck around for round two and engaged decently at the second fort two hours later, and didn't immediately run home with his tail between his legs because we made the obvious defensive play.  
---
Also, our supers are two mids are a regional gate away, so where is your execuse for not bringing your own caps this time?  You surely have way more dreads than we can field.
---
If by the time the rest of your group arrives you loose your dictors, the buble goes out, the super warps out and tether, you were probably too far away to do anything anyway.
---
you two should 1v1 at the sun
---
Yeah but I don't mind them using carriers to defend a structure when they're out numbered by subcaps.  That's fine is what i'm saying.  There should just be no sirens.
---
I used to work for a prop shop where the designers were using Rhino. Once the prop was 3D printed I would paint them. Started learning  Rhino to maybe try and become a designer for that company but it didn't work out
---
Calling for a twitch debate, and presenting video analysis along with comments/input from FCs from all over EVE is being a jackass about it?
---
I mean don't get me wrong, PGL can be irritating as fuck, but this is not one of those times.
---
Small gang roams.do NOT exist. I dunno where that thought that they do came from. I haven't seen a small gang roam that didn't end in supers dropped on their face in about 18 months
---
Instead of making it an interesting concept that can add additional activities to the game, I think CCP should just keep making some OK looking SKINs, that only apply to about 3 ships actually flown and 15 ships no one ever touches, and then charge about $18 per SKIN, per ship. 
---
fatigue changes were fine, but i had no issue with old fighters, old tracking (no haws), old triage.  
---
theres alot of stuff that has changed since then though, citadels, cap ship utility slots and capital modules, sov system, etc.  Things are a bit too far gone at this point to thing anything from the past is going to solve the current game problems, they're just not all that compatible anymore.
---
I would have been fine with the glue for a while though if it meant we got a different iteration of eve changes than what we currently have.
---
also give subs a cap counter. like a heavy torpedo bomber t2 battleships
---
that is a respectable stance to take and i wold want to have a conversation with a lowsec veteran about their meta when know nothing about it but it makes me giggle when wormholers start crying about things in Null because their angry about their changes but in Null supers, titans and carriers are oppressive and dreads are pointless outside of an ambush

A leader within the game's largest power bloc that can defeat pretty much anyone with a ferrox blob (and everyone else by actually logging in caps and supers) has made it his mission to address balance issues in the game.  
---
If your objective is truly to "focus on the simplest most glaring issue that would at least get some daily content back into this game", I strongly suggest you login to eve and take a nice hard look at your blue list and rethink your bizarre unholy alliance with goons. I understand that ship balance and OP tactics are distinct from the issues of player distributions between power blocs but please, don't contend to lead a crusade purposed on fixing eve using the word "balance" when you repeatedly make a habbit of blobbing the shit out of virtually every fleet you encounter.

because that's the most content you actually get out of supers, the rest is just formup/standdown ops. 
---
Can't remember the last time a small gang roam didn't end up with supers dropped after long enough. I've had 3 supers dropped a 5 man cruiser gang. I've had 4 titans dropped on  20 man Subcap gang. 
---
I know I know adapt etc and to a point I have but it's ridiculous that the above examples are considered a viable option

&gt;All of you have opinions, 99.9% of them are wrong, but you deserve the opportunity to find that out the hard way.

All of this because PGL misplaced a dread fleet?

---
The fundamental thing to understand about markets in EVE is that for (the vast majority of) items, the "sell price" is the highest bid that an actual player has put in a buy order that covers your current station. These buy orders can be up to region wide, but folks who place region wide buy orders and who place orders in low-traffic regions are planning to gather up their purchases and ship them for resale. And they price accordingly. If you want the best prices, you need to be selling where the bulk buyers are shipping to.
---
Alternatively, you can place sell orders and pick your own price, but items may move slowly (or not at all) if you are selling the wrong stuff or at the wrong prices.
---
I prefer capitals online thanks
---
1) Having an ethos or purpose the defines your group is key.  Being able to describe what makes you different than other groups is an important thing to help maintain a group focus and bring people in.
---
2) The metagame is real. You will have foes, so you will need friends.  Start relationships with other groups, get to know them, and begin forging bonds that will help in times of stress.
---
Rorquals + Engineering Complexes (and skill injectors) are what made Capitals basically T1 Battleships in terms of ease to replace, but the cat is out of the bag now. Supers are everywhere that apply 3k DPS to untackled cruisers  and aren't going away even if CCP does the right thing (IMO) and turns the Rorqual back into a boosting ship and make Hulks come back as the strongest mining ship.   
---
In reality, I think Capitals need to have their roles re-explored.  
---
Dreads currently work the best. Anti-Cap/Structure, OR Anti-Sub. Need to choose beforehand, very immobile, no logi while in siege, even with HAW they still can easily be immobilised and held down by frigates and require support of some kind to apply to most HAC/AB Strat cruiser targets, can be out-ranged by most 100km+ LR subs too. So they have to hard commit and are sitting ducks without support.
---
Carriers are kind of weird. They have a weird mix of niche roles, mostly anti-subcap though, or serve as economy super capital force multipliers with support fighters for helping tackle other caps plus Anti-SS fighters for shooting down enemy FiBos mostly, or trebuchet.   
---
Faxes are huge force multipliers for Supers/Titans. each one must be killed for supers/titans to die, since they nullify around 50k+ DPS per FAX vs them (Depending on Active/Passive hards etc.)
---
Supers are basically Dreads/Carrier Hybrids with all the strengths and none of the weaknesses that both types have that have 15-20x the EHP, can be fully aligned and have no siege requirement, while having fantastic resists to the point where 1 Fax can nullify 5-8 Dreads worth of DPS on it depending on type, that can fulfill both HAW (LR) and Anti-Cap (SR) without having to choose before the fight unlike Dreads, doesn't have the positional immobility and predictability and range limit of Dreads, while also being able to support it's own damage and tackle with Support fighters. They are basically 1 man swiss army wrecking balls, with frigate scan res.
---
Titans are just Dreadnoughts that have 30x (or way more for full tank) EHP, no siege requirement, huge resists, more damage, huge alpha weapon with Doomsday. Fucks subs with HAW fits, BOSON. Provides fantastic utility with Phenoms, JB.   
---
The General problem I see is that a Super completely overshadows a Dreadnoughts role, with none of the weaknesses of Dreads, and just having tons of stats, resists and RR on top of that, while also being able to perform every other role in eve, bubble, point, web, anti-support, anti-cap. Titans also obsolete Dreads and Supers in any task that isn't tackling, trebuchet or krab defense. Titans/Supers getting full reps from FAXes is shit.  
---
The TL;DR is that Capitals are entirely about n+1 wins. If you have a bigger composition of Supers+Titans and enough Faxes then you will not take losses, there is nothing you can do. Non-Spodbrain Rorquals are mostly untouchable under Super umbrellas. And you cannot win with dreadbombs when 1 FAX neutralises 6-8 dreads. Unless you literally have better than something like 5:1 odds with Dreads vs enemy Fax+Supers, you aren't going to accomplish anything.   
---
IMO the general problems as a solo/small gang guy as I see them.   
---
Fighters suck in TIDI fests, way too good at applying to random raiders/roaming gangs, obsolete need for your own roaming subcap defense fleets, cause lag in big battles.  
---
FAX reps are way too good on Supers/Titans.  
---
Supers apply to Subs way too well, and obsolete dreads in almost every single way. Heavy LR fighters are generally the biggest offender here. Support Fighters obsolete need for sub tackle.   
---
Titans also apply to Subs way too well, BOSON/GTFO cancerous.   
---
I'm not sure what the solution is, but I personally think that LR Heavy fighters, and to a lesser extent, light fighters, should have their application nerfed. Titans/Supers should have a RR debuff that prevents them from getting huge values from Faxes, Titans should lose access to HAW guns, or nerf HAWs and give Dreads a big tracking boost while in siege so they can wreck BCs/Cruisers but Titans struggle with anything that isn't tackled BS+. Delete BOSONs, Delete GTFO. 
---
Question though, and I’m not sure if you know this. 
---
Yes it was a ballsy play, assuming everything else was equal.

Ron I like you better when you steer clear of propaganda.  You’re the attacking force.  Don’t blame the defender for doing whatever best suits it.

this is the literal outcome of all conflict in eve, except in hisec .... which might be the best explanation for the perimeter hi-jinx.

PGL's four points aren't nearly far enough. Clipping the edges of this problem. It needs to be run over with a lawnmower.

#Remove faxes, or prevent faxes from repping supercapitals. 
---
The current sov meta is defined by the invincible-yet-unriskable titan+fax invincibility combo. There's no counter other than more titans, but any sovnull alliance that actually *risks* its titans in real fights will quickly not be a sovnull alliance. So most major conflicts are decided by one side deciding they're outmatched and quietly leaving (with no fights); while super+fax umbrellas suppress all other content in nullsec with total impunity. No big fights, no small fights, not a lot of point trying for content out here. 
---
Damn I've been building up to releasing my own anti-fax manifesto and now I gotta figure out if I should try to sync it up with this or put it on reddit separate

so, 40% upvote rate, where am I wrong?

is rightclick-jumpto good gameplay? is this why Bombers Bar &gt; Spectre?

I understand force multipliers like FAX can be nice to fight outnumberd.

Or have simply way to many invested way to much money and time into their cap gameplay?

Can noone see we won't survive the second decade going on like this?

Proliferation might be an issue but thb it's already way out of the ballpark. Once the biggest superfleets became unbeatable by anything other than other superfleets, we were past the point of no return. This probably happened in like 2010, 2011 or so. **New proliferation only lets more people join the "people who matter club" and makes it easier to risk your shinies; it doesn't make subs less unimportant in big fights.**

How about the real war in 2018 where Panfam lost trillions and trillions of isk in structures, keepstars, and titans. That war doesn't even have a real name yet because how ridiculously panfam lost it. You have a good reason to complain about those other mechanics but null sec wars is what pgl wants to fix.
---
Probably already working on a capital class boosher to hype for an upcoming expansion, with a few new rank 16 skills to inject into.
---
Excavs are actually great for solo/smallgang frags and theft though. Legit the #1 remaining option for blops pilots trying to work under a supercap umbrella. 
---
Slower, 2450 lmao.
---
I don't mind capitals. I understand why big toys are nice to have, I like having a dread and dropping it myself, but there is a margin between having a lot of caps, and having caps able to achieve basically everything. They need balance. Not turbo uselessness, but a margin between "not worth using caps" and "using caps against everything because it's easier and better than subcaps"
---
imagine getting baited by joecuster on reddit
---
Just introduce propulsion mods for citadels, they already do everything else anyway.

Absolutely brilliant. Well played.

joe brings all the retards to the yard.
---
If Sirens are as strong as you claim, why didn't we frag more then?  I know caps are an easy scapegoat, but believe it or not Sirens aren't that strong when used as the only form of tackle.  
---
Unless you allow the enemy (super)carriers to launch Sirens on you at 0 Km in combination with Dromis, you can kite them.  Some math: with our fit, max skilled sirens go 1,160 Km/s in an Archon.  Your Eagles go over 2,100 m/s with links.  Any time the MWD on the Sirens is down, you out pace it nearly 2:1 making it easy to kite out of range.
---
You should! Pure Blind has been a hell of a lot of fun. Hop on comms some night.
---
Yea, the great thing about eve is there’s a few paths you can take which can be very different from each other, a lot of people have dabbled in most of them, like me - but it’s been years since I was a wormholer (btw) or a member of a large null bloc, so I have no idea what the state of their game is right now. 
---
Short: overfarming factor won't work, it's baseline amount of resources possible to be extracted (meaning - what you can get if you farm the system in near perfect way) from every system to be cut down significantly, otherwise someone will find a way to play the system and we're back to square one while actually only hurting "the little guy".
---
Resource scarcity will actually help in all those cases too, you skipped how other players would affect groups that spread across the space. Having big organization spread (think goons) across 5-6 regions means they're either staged in one place while leaving other parts of their space barely defended at all, including defense against roamers etc; or they spread their umbrella across that space, effectively cutting down critical mass needed to deal solid blow to them hard. The moment you create something like that, you bring new life to whatever dreadbombing and hotdropping groups they are, not having to deal with supercap umbrella or having to deal with supercap response that's manageable in size means they'll have much more targets and much more opportunities to keep hitting everyone.
---
Over time it leads to local groups either becoming more restrained with dropping on whatever moves (you never know if you're being baited or not), or repeatedly getting dunked and having to rebuild losses every time someone comes prepared for easy cap kills. And it's not something we didn't see, back when megablob consolidation wasn't as prominent as now, we've got many examples of home defense drops being exploited by external groups, with cases like D-W beacon incident (PL+HK+friends dreadbombing goons), CO2 getting dreadbombed in 9-IIBL by GWCS, another time CO2 got dreadbombed (this time by PL), TEST eating up big RED/Stain dreadbomb twice after taking Esoteria, early 2018 Snuff+Goons dreadbomb on GOTG superfleet, Horde getting bombed in their own space in early 2018 by Snuff+BL+friends and many, many more smaller or less notable incidents.
---
Another thing to consider, thanks to the fact fatigue exists, is bringing back high viability of 100MN cruiser small-to-medium sized doctrines, which generally work well against capital response unless being in position to be completely overwhelmed by sheer number of capitals - which shouldn't be a problem for majority of space if people are forced to spread out. Even in worst case of full centralization like we have now, you'll end up with either overpopulation so heavy people will start leaving that part of space, or with pvers being outside umbrella and having to rely on whatever local response they can self-coordinate in about 70-80% of space with remaining 20-30% being hard to touch (just like now). Even if you manage to create longer skirmish against whatever local response was there, them getting support will take time and might/should allow you to do what you wanted and extract before they get there.
---
No amount of cap nerfs will change what's going on now - having more than enough players able to react on moments notice with no long term drawback to that; and arguably any kind of capital nerfs will affect using capitals offensively and taking risks even more than any kind of defensive overkill. Even if you nerf caps into being suitcase and bridge boats, there's still titan bridge capable of bringing those masses sitting in one place and being ready to protect their own alts from any harm. In the end, it doesn't really matter what gets dropped on you, if there's no way to get near guaranteed sweep of whatever roam/fleet came to someones space, everyone will just dock up the moment your scout shows up on intel.
---
CCPlz being dependent on so few people, with such a high average spend per person. keenly feels when they piss off 10% of the community.
---
its not like wow, where you lose 100k subscribers and it's 1.5m / mo in revenue.  Eve players are whales in comparison.
---
so removing haw guns on titans would do a lot, no point in fielding a titan fleet if it cant hit the subcaps you're fighting
---
&gt;nothing was teleported from GLD4U (the drone renter alliance) to be killed in highsec
---
Duh, you don't teleport unknown randos for a public execution. The goal of a public execution isn't to punish, it's to entertain. CCP cherry picked the most recognizable names in the largest ships for public execution to increase the entertainment value. No one is impressed by VNIs being publicly executed.
---
For two days straight my statics take me shattered systems with TONS of sites and twice more sigs. I don't scan anything, I just bring in the farming plows and harvest as much of those blue doughnuts as possible :)
---
&gt; There's already a delay between havens respawning
---
From what i remember, that's not the case in an upgraded system. Last time i could be active (1-3 months ago?), i remember perpetually running in a carrier that rock haven (and not touching the two cloud ones) for hours a day with the only interruptions being enemies in local, not respawn couldown.
---
Every time I enter a wormhole there are 2 stars.. OOOOHHHHH!!!!!
---
I was thinking more like alliance level achievements that reflect on individuals that participated.
---
We're trying to adapt but wheeler keeps feeding our caps to Snuff
---
You should totally be able to warp small subcap gangs to 0 on smartbombing battleships.
---
It's truly saddening that people can't let the "us" against "THEM" and propaganda go for a single post and discuss the game we've spent years of our life on.
---
The same game mechanics that are shitting on his deployments shat on yours a year ago.
---
Whether his points are good or not, the resulting discussion can only make the game better.
---
He may have done it.But he didn't start a campaign against capitals while "PL and the north were folding like a lawn chair", he started a campaign after some fail dreadbombs and a failed invasion
---
I see a future where hundreds of booshers are smartbombed to death under the oppressive capital smartbombs before they can spool.
---
just saying, family drama is the most epic in all of human history.
---
Take your logic elsewhere sir, there’s no room for it in this holy struggle.
---
Just because you can't suck your own dick does not mean that others should do it for you.
---
Supers and titans should be incredibly powerful vs caps and not below, caps should be strong vs battleships and battlecruisers and not below, and rorqs should have more risk associated with their use. 
---
Some suggestions:
---
- HAW dreads are fine, but HAW titans are dumb. A ship that can only realistically be killed by a massive cap escalation shouldn't be able to wreck subcaps. 
---
- I don't know how I feel about bosons, because it is good that people are risking their titans. But they seem a bit easy, maybe the lance should be the only AOE dd. 
---
- Supers shouldn't be able to field all kinds of fighters with bonuses applied. Supers should be bonused for heavies specifically, and regular carriers for lights and possibly supports (but only so as to replicate existing balance/stats). Also, supers shouldn't be able to field dromis AND sirens, they should have to make the same choice carriers do. 
---
- Nerf fighter application, hard. Sort out the tracking on LR guns as well, at least for titans. Like however hard that problem is, it needs to be sorted. A supercarrier should not be the optimal response to a cruiser gang, and LR titans shouldn't be the best response to a battleship fleet. 
---
- For rorqs, either remove panic or remove their outrageous local tank. Also I honestly think excavators were a tremendous mistake, as they have completely eclipsed exhumers. I think the game would be a lot more healthy if rorqs provided incredibly strong (yes, even stronger) bonuses to barges/exhumers rather than being afk solo monsters that can be run 20 at a time. Make rorquals an incredibly advantageous part of a mining fleet, rather than a self-sufficient isk printer. 
---
- In general, cynos need looking at. 
---
Don't get me wrong, capitals and supers are cool, and it is great that they are seeing much more use. But the balance is out of whack, because whether it's ratting, mining, home defense or offensive deployments, capitals dominate the game in a way that's become extremely boring. 
---
It was hilarious 
---
You mean Goonswarm ?
---
I think it’s partly because you said “don’t go easy, use the hammer”. 
---
A lot of people enjoy the gameplay, but also recognise that there could be improvements. A lot of other people enjoy capitals on small scale levels, such as solo drops, or hunting them (you’re a wormholer right?), and maybe don’t appreciate someone who they feel may not fully understand their gameplay shitting all over it. 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5MfgefJVAE
---
Our dog is cooler
---
To do what?  Die?
---
I think we can all agree that dreads need a buff.  Give them a bunch of tank in exchange for removing HAW guns (and NSAs and GTFO module and excavators) from the game.
---
The best thing about the needed changes is that they're mostly removing things from the game, which is relatively simple.  The most complicated part is reimbursing people for those things already made.
---
No matter what CCP does that touch economy or resources distribution, large groups will roflstomp small ones for the big chunk of money. Having only one rich hotspot making large groups viable would force competitions specifically between those, and small spots for all the others would make the rest of the map still useful for smaller groups.
---
fax aren't force multiplier lol they're just meatshields for your supers 
---
Majority hate nano gangs....
---
Super pilot.
---
I agree partially, but I also feel that a huge chunk of the issue is the whole skill-injector + rorqual issue - beforehand, if something was OP, there would be time to see it shake out, and could make tweaks before it got too bad.
---
Instead, we've now got mass capital proliferation, a mineral index that has crashed through the floor, and anyone with the money can burn a new alt for for said caps in about 20 min. And that doesn't include the whole "everyone injecting into new metas" about a week after balancing/changes.
---
Yes, caps could definitely use some adjustment. But we need to fix the cause of this imbalance too, otherwise in 6 months +1week, it'll be Orca Blobs Online or some other such stupidity (though I'd be ok with Coraxes Online - that poor ship deserves some spotlight time)
---
Is it really a holy war if you have to open up with "please help if you can"?

I mean yes, he played for like 2 months, 4 years ago.

Do you have any tips on how to take things everyone agrees on and turn them into a politicized shitshow?

Do they have skinz?

Like moths to a flame 
---
Untill the large Group grows enough to consume all spots fun for many people is winning and if you cant beat it join it is how goons got big so yeah that doesnt work several games tried yet all failed 
---
Using what numbers? Dotlan? If that were the case, PL would be forming 2500 dudes lol
---
Debating a narcissist...yeah...fun...
---
Because of this statement you know he doesn't want a discussion, he just want's claqueurs.
---
I'm actually for a cap balance in favor of subcaps, but even if his cause is right, he won't be able to achive something as long as he acts like an arrogant prick.
---
&gt;I just haven't tried to publicly berate people with it.
---
You probably stand a better chance of convincing people if you stick to that policy.
---
I'd agree if CCP hadn't painted themselves into a corner by declaring a *change* in the role of all mining command ships.
---
The only reason we are blue to goons is because of how NCPL turbo stomped us in the north under jammers with the N+1 supercap blob
---
And a good way to do that is to make subcaps more relevant.
---
Small sub 20 people fights were the best time I had in eve

Is it me or have these 2 past threads just been thinking of ways to get twitch viewers?

I think you should go back and watch some of those streams at the time. He was on pretty much all of the INN streams talking about specifically Faxes and also capitals being way too overpowered. Just because you ignored it and it doesn't fit your new narrative does not mean he wasn't one of the loudest voices behind the fax nerf or capital proliferation previously.
---
As they should.
---
;)
---
at least 70% of r/eve are turbokrabs who can't deal with more than 2 active modules at the same time, high upvote rates here tend to be a negative sign if anything else.

---
CCP happy to balance the retribution... not willing to look at ram jag.
---
So I am not giving CCP any ideas... Nerf Capitals.. then we can talk about sub-capital balance.
---
CCP cannot do not do multi-tasking.
---
Not sure if this is sarcasm or not, but i small gang roam everyday or so. Normally with 3-5 guys is the norm, though sometimes we get a little big at 8-10 dudes, just depends on the time zone. We just assume everything is a cyno and stay a safe distance. Once the cyno is lit, we just leave, as we aren't going to do every roam in an anti-capital comp. You'll sometimes get people to chase you off the cyno and into another system, then we just rinse/repeat.
---
Lulz
---
The problem is the proliferation.  As others have said, everyone has capitals now.  It’s almost at a point where it’s weird for people not to have a suitcase carrier.  When everyone has easy access, you’re going to see things used in huge numbers.  The same reasoning applies to supercarriers and titans.  We’re at a point where a fair number of alliances have been around long enough to easily afford large numbers of supercaps.
---
Maybe it’s time to change the requirements for building these things, make them a lot harder to get.  Also nerf Rorqs into the ground.
---
I agree that haws need re evaluating specifically for titans as do bosons. GTFOs are an absolutely stupid idea and need removing but we havent seen them used enough to create an outcry apart from the last 48 hours.
---
The main problem with the argument on the dread bomb subject is just simply the nature and natural timeline of how these things usually play out; Assuming one side is only willing to commit caps and not supercaps but the otherside is then all we see is that side clearing faxes while losing significant chunks of their fleet every 5 minutes and bleeding it inbetween; Thats just a fact of an unbalanced super fight. 
---
In reference to the L4X fight recently; Feeding 270 dreads in trade for 70 faxes is absolutely atrocious but comes primarily down to DD timers and their ability to remove dreads straight up - Without trawling the kills with 70 titans on field and 2 DD's required to kill a dread without a CHE (DD's dont show on your hud so you dont know when you're being zonked) and the fight lasting approximately 20 minutes before tapi gave up entirely you're looking at 140 dreads just straight up being deleted and not being fully utilised in trading effectively - Even with CHEs you're looking at massive losses thanks to the titans superiority and thanks to the CHE nerf which saw dreads being nerfed more than faxes were.
---
The tactics are obviously far different in a super v super brawl and this still needs to be explored more without crippling server disconnects and general server fuckups.
---
 
---
LR fighters do need nerfing to the point where you need to support their damage application, either through the use of a dromi or a burst projector to anything smaller than a BS.
---
But again; all these problems have become an issue because an entity with a supercap or capital umbrella/regional dominance can get away with using these with impunity thanks to both Quick reaction projection and mineral+skill point proliferation, allowing everyone to get into anything they want quickly instead of having to train slowly into them.
---
Ccp will maybe read this post, then put up a sale on injectors (so more people can get in caps), and add a few skins to the store. Good luck
---
Eh idk I don’t think the big ships should be able to track a dram honestly, I also don’t think a dram should be able to anything to a super + , damage or otherwise
---
🤔
---
Jesus Christ this is a bad post
---
I was just meming. But yes dreads are in a weird part of the meta right now. There is no point using them to kill citadels because of damage caps, and they also suck against FAX and supers, so just take supers. So people just use them to dunk small numbers of caps or lone supers, or meme on small gangs.
---
r/eve.  It's like r/all but with logos pasted on top.

You should have Ron be your co-host.

He unironically does a wonderful job on TiS keeping people on topic.
---
The prevalance of PVP in PVP is destroying PVP.
---
There is nothing wrong with people fighting in t1 ships, provided there is an interesting balance and good engagements result.
---
Right now, cap v cap balance is OK though dreads are weak (or more accurately fax are strong), and carriers kind of meh. The subcap meta is pretty decent by itself, although booshballa are probably becoming too prevalent and need more counters. But at the point of interaction, caps/supers completely dominate the landscape. It's not healthy for the game. 
---
GOT EM

reset the servers

your welcome I fixed it

But where is AMC?

Panfam had many chances to prevent that, but their actions were pushing Legacy and Goons closer and closer together.
---
World Word Ree was the final Panfam mistake and now they are paying for it.
---
Wouldn't one want to layer the rent payer from the botter anyway?
---
basically
---
I'd absolutely love to debate. Tell me when.
---
No one is going to bring up valid points against the argument that capital balance has been bad. But if your goal is to refresh Eve, the focus should be on breaking down the large coalitions and having conditions that foster more conflict on a smaller scale. 
---
And also, there are more than 1 or 2 "real battles" a month. Have you seen the BRs coming from the Min-Amarr WZ, Derelik, Provi? No they are not 500B Max TiDi snorefasts - rather low or NO TiDi, 50-100b, 100 v 100, fights where almost everyone enjoys themselves. Even a recent fight against Snuff wasn't ~terrible~. 
---
Honestly if you crusaded for that, I'd support you all the way, FWIW.
---
Sadly people want to take the path of least resistance, instead of learning proper PVP and taking engagements, they want to throw a carrier at any nano gang that disrupts their isk-making. It's disgusting what capitals are capable of doing, they're really broken.
---
No, when omega ends, you stop adding sp. what your describing was known as “ghost training” and hasn’t been working for several years now.
---
On a side note, when omega time ends, that’s what is called “the happy ending” 
---
Both of those actually would be counterproductive to what you aim to achieve, given enough organization and strong leadership - in case of #1 you're promoting having shared space and mixed groups even more than now, by making any system fully usable only by multi-TZ groups and harming tendency for players to stick to people they play with (like same TZ corps in same system), while #2 encourages locust fleet-like approach even more.
---
For lower resource viability, better idea would be to limit site respawns similar to how they work in w-space (site can respawn in any system out of a group) and making sure those systems are not close to each other - say, have every system linked with 5-8 others randomly across EVE (and, say, restrict to one per region in each group) and for every time anomaly despawns, it respawns in randomly selected system across those few. And to cut down any attempts of abusing it, reroll those connections every 1-3 months or so, while also disabling all easy ways of triggering anomaly despawn without clearing it fully. To secure the system from ihub sniping abuse, make it so if anomaly would spawn in system without appropriate upgrade, it becomes "ghost anomaly" that will expire after normal despawn time (72 hours or so) and is unreachable otherwise.
---
this is it, this is the point, every side in the game has now lost at some point to capitals.

Can't smartbomb a boosh fleet if it's spearfishing from 500km.
---
No, well, Mebbe, but each of these skills can only be bought using real money in the store. Also if we can get hand weapons (sword/axe) and get out of our ships and run around killing things. I’d also like if there were different races and if we could cast magic spells.
---
Then again, yeah im going back to my original answer....”No”
---
You might know the game is broke, but what do you do about it?
---
You can just go play PUBG or some shit.
---
You can keep trying to play the game.
---
Just because you keep trying to play doesn't change the fact the game might be broke.  You might even realize the game is more broke then you thought.
---
So I'm not sure what you are getting at.  The timing of whatever PGL is doing is irrelevant.  It doesn't change the state of the game.
---
I think you guys killed like 5 eagles in the first volley of fighters. We only had like 130 in our fleet, not sure how many of those were eagles. You guys were doing really well. Basically, as soon as you let the fighters go we had to warp off. This post was just teasing you guys about not coming to fight us in subcaps after you won the timer.
---
You missed a zero.  Back in the day when there was a big capital fight there'd be 100-200 easy to pop off on.  Now it's not hard to push that number to 1000.
---
There is no TEST, only spies.
---
https://i.giphy.com/media/kPbuseKjYmmac/giphy.webp
---
Your last point is probably part of it, this is also reddit where the larger outspoken majority is test/goons/supercap embracing line members. 
---
I’m with you. Caps are everywhere and a little too good imo. Sure they’re great in null as a heavy asset over critical objectives, but they’re also used as a “this fight isn’t going perfectly let’s drop titans”, which is the issue imo. In wormholes you see like 1 or 2 caps thrown at something (due to mass restrictions obviously but point still stands) and to me it’s a massive game changer. Which imo is how they should be. Cyno goes up and a fax and carrier wing jumps through should be oh shit, not “hah baited” and a fleet of supers jumping in for you to annihilate them, all while rorqs are mining and replacing everything lost before the fights over.
---
The bigger problem, at least to me, is there isn’t a single fix. Removing excavators? More rorqs get multiboxed, mineral prices rise a bit. Remove support fighters from supers? You’re just gonna have a carrier sitting there with dromis and sirens too. Maybe the answer is removing HAW guns and support fighters completely? Idk. My point is the answer (if CCP even cares) to cap proliferation *I* think is multifaceted. Imo leshaks were a great start as a good subcap tool for killing caps, but that’s still a slightly pricey solution, and at the end of the day they’re still battleships which are vulnerable to caps. Caps deserve to be strong given the right environment, but at the moment it seems they’re the answer to everything from frigates to other caps, which is definitely not healthy for the game
---
&gt;HAW dreads are fine, but HAW titans are dumb. A ship that can only realistically be killed by a massive cap escalation shouldn't be able to wreck subcaps.
---
This statement doesn't make sense. Why would a large ship all of a sudden lose the ability to kill smaller ships? In fact the larger the ship, the more guns you can emplace, which would make it even more deadly to smaller ships.
---
Mining was supposed to be there role tho
---
remove excavs and people have to mine in barges again. barges aren't exactly known for being tanky, or spread out.
---
"learning proper PVP" this kind of elitist gibberish is what gets so many people on the train against cap changes as it shits on the elitists who think nano is the only viable playstyle in the game and any ship which costs under 500m and is not a cruiser is a non viable playstyle. You should try to get dudes onboard with liking diffrent gameplay instead of just shittin on theirs and gloryfying your own. 
---
&gt;no coordination between the Test guys
---
I thought this would be assumed.
---
You are right!

That's why there are Supercapital ships
---
#Fuck capital ships
---
Yep, he use to ask his fans to chat spam people he played against causing them to disconnect.
---
This was before you could turn off chat from people not on your list. 
---
But not really though, because the same people that blob can now blob capitals, especially with injectors. As far as sub caps go the only and effective counter to a blob is speed and skill, stretching the incoming fleet out and killing shit in the process. Maybe caps should be fast, not agile but fast while having an array of other support mechanics, actually take some skill to pilot instead of sitting basically perfectly still and getting bubbles just waiting for cynos. The most expensive ships in the game shouldn’t be the most boring ones. 
---
Not a big PGL or Test fan, but +1 on this. Fuck caps.
---
so im guessing jita is where bulk buyers are shipping to?
---
You made my point. All I used to do was small gang roam. When I played that is. But it became a tedious affair when 50% of the things you tackle lit a cyno. 
---
Same. Those roams were the best. Stomp everything in site for hours, it's so late and you're 40 jumps from home so you just welp the whole fleet and pods on a capital gate camp so you can get home and go to sleep!
---
CCP listens to money, not cries on reddit. If you really had an issue, you would get all players to stop subbing until demands are met.
---
Mikal this is truly a good post. Well done. 
---
If your 'friend' was incapable of navigating to the website and reading then he won't be a good fit. Agents need to be self-motivated.
---
50% of the time was a cyno? Those were good times. Now i'd chalk it up to 75-80% of the time, its a cyno, or a cyno ship is inbound to your gang.

Could always come join us.

awwww was hoping for a cartoon video, left very sad

Says someone who has not played the game in years. He makes his viewers by complaining a lot. just move on and dont give him the time of day
---
Injectors are the terminal illness killing off Eve slowly. also Rorqs. My Corp has like 50 dudes and the only time they are logged in is to  rorq mine and drop capitals. That's it. NO ROAMS, nothing fun to do. Just mining and cap blobbing. So I chose not to play basically since that is the norm everywhere.
---
It's my fault for assuming you'd understand I'm not a hauler.
---
Besides, you probably represent the 1% who know how to avoid being ganked during Burn Jita (other than the smartest, who simply don't login or undock for a few days). There are literally thousands of other ~~targets~~ pilots who do not.
---
It's for balance, or at least the semblance of balance. Typically battleships apply pretty well to battlecruisers and normal cruisers, but can't hit frigates for shit.
---
It's basically the same reason you don't use a cannon as a sniper rifle. 
---
My eyes!
---
If the mistake means more fights I am all for it, people just need to get used to the fact that if you hit someones structure they have incentive to defend it. For you this was calling goons into highsec, for us it was to move the super umbrella. 
---
Yup. That was always (and still is to a lesser extent now since theyve been nerfed) the selling point of t3cs. They can do what things on par with BCs or even BSs in some cases, I’m a cruiser hull size.

Would like some kinda dev blog from CCP not the CSM.
---
Lowsec is calling
---
They were rediculously strong. I don’t want to say it was needed but it helped diversify the game so that everyone wasn’t flying the same thing because it was so strong.
---
Because it's a game not a simulation. In eve spaceships work like submarines and planets and moons are completely the wrong size. The point of a game is to be fun.
---
However, even if you look at real navies, you'll find that carriers are incredibly vulnerable to smaller vessels and require an entire strike force of frigates, destroyers, cruisers, and submarines. You don't get fleets made out of supercarriers and nothing else. 
---
wormhole besthole

So you support the removal of PANIC?

I'll bring it up at the next All Players meeting

Yes that easy...
---
1. Do stuff.

2. Do stuff. (I can't stress this enough, activity is the most important thing)

3. Don't do everything yourself, the more people are creating content, the better it is.

4. Watch who you recruit. It needs to fit your alliance.
---
5. Give yourself time.
---
6. Use your brain

7. Get friends

That's basically all you need to know. You will learn, you will make mistakes. See where it goes and the people take you. Learn from your mistakes. Don't be afraid to make decisions though.

8. How do you even pick a favourite out of that category. There's so many.
---
PGL lost all common sence again LOL
---
No I think their outrageous local tank should be removed.  I actually like the idea of the panic module, but it shouldn't require 40-50k DPS to force them to use it.  Many Many more rorquals would die if a 10 man gang could realistically push it into panic (and then didn't have to worry about the siren blob being dropped on it)
---
Isnt that what it's designed for? Literally a giant space toilet.
---
More like over 1/2 of players disappear from the game overnight, and Pearl Abyss shut CCP down due to lack of profit.
---
I mean he's not wrong, PL hasn't done anything meaningful in like 3 years
---
Yup. After we tried to drag them along to delve with us to finish the job they started they instead dragged their heels and decided that we looked like easier and better targets than goons did. Pan Fam have had the opportunity to deploy down to Delve for multiple years now, but instead they wanted to go for the EZ WIN L337 PVP mode and try to stomp TEST and Brave and contest us instead of the enemy we all agreed was the true enemy years ago. This pushed us to accepting goons as more than neighbors to simply ensure that they'd stop tunneling visioning on TEST and esso and actually leave us the hell alone for a while.

Find a small-medium size active group in your timezone.

If you are USTZ/EUTZ check out Unspoken Alliance.

You may not.   But in no way do I foresee this turning out poorly.

GTFOs are insane.

They are as broken as when tidi didn't affect a timer.
---
Yeah I fully agree.
---
I'm just tired of ppl complaining about Legacy and Goons working together, while noone bitches about other coalitions trying to gangbang and evict Legacy last summer. 
---
Useful point of reference, I personally (and anyone in initial wave) got off about 4-5 dd's, so each titan should have killed 2 and a half.
---
What do you think about subcaps "strategic bombers" based on ABC hull that can delete caps and supers the same way bombers delete battleships.
---
There seems to be a free slot when the State of the Union address was supposed to happen.

Get PGL to congress.

Just sell it to Goons
---
What are 3200's?
---
You are a shit economist if you fuck up talking like this.  No wonder you were up at 5am on a business day.  smh
---
Panic doesn’t need to be removed, it should just not apply to the ship using it. It should just be a fleet support module.
---
One of the only times you will hear me say this, stain guy was right. Rorqs are there to force the defenders to fight instead of docking up. If you want more fights double the siege time and cut invul in half. With just those two changes you will have an entirely different field. 
---
While yes, they do have drones, their ability to fight back like other caps(excluding fax) is severely hindered. They don't have the dps or mobility of a carrier, the dps of a dread or the shear power of a titan. They also don't have the tank or the repping power of a fax. Getting rid of the mining aspect will make them useless.

Beware of hauling all your items to Jita to get a better price. There are numerous places along the route where your hauler can get hijacked (ganked). Especially if it's a T1 industrial with cargo expanders carrying more than 100m. Notably the Balle corridor and Uedama area.
---
Use https://evemarketer.com/ to look up some of your highest value items and head a place that offers reasonable prices.
---
The main trade hubs in approximate order of largest to smallest are:  
---
Jita 4-4 CNAP (Caldari, The Forge, #1 hub)  
---
Amarr 8 EFA (Amarrian, Domain, #2 hub)  
---
Dodixie 9-20 FNAP (Gallente, Sinq Liason) *  
---
Hek 8-12 BCF (Minmatar, Metropolis) *  
---
Rens 6-8 BTT (Minmatar, Heimatar)  
---
\* Try these ones first.
---
I was personally up north, as far as I could tell it was half of panfam and some smaller blocs vs legacy, what was the number disparity of your average fight? Or were they dropping supers up until \*I forget the system name\*?
---
Its called game balance and doesn't need to match realistic scenarios.
---
If you want to go down that rabbit hole, why can't my battleship's large guns/launchers hit for full damage on an interceptor with no effort and also fit a point defense system to nuke fighters/drones?
---
EVE is balanced by the bigger the ship, the less it applies to things smaller than it. Also, larger ships aren't bonused to smaller weapons. HAW are technically battleship sized, but put on a system developed for dreads/capitals.
---
Taking a que from other balancing points in the game, you don't see any battlecruisers with RLML bonuses do you? No, because RLML is a cruiser weapon made for anti-frigate. A battlecruiser is 1 level above a cruiser and 3 levels above a frigate. They don't get access to those weapons being bonused, because then, whats the purpose of using an RLML caracal if a RLML drake is just always better at killing frigs and other larger ships.
---
I think HAWs should be the same way and Titan's looked at as being a higher class than dreads that don't get access to smaller weapons. A Dread is 1-2 levels above a battleship, a Titan is 3.
---
If you want a lore reason, just say HAW were developed specifically for dreadnoughts and that they have the hardpoints to properly fit them and Titan hardpoints are setup specifically for XL/Capital weapons.
---
I am not doubting that the game is broken.But the timing is not irrelevant at all.PGL is using the general mood of this sub to his own advantage, while not touching the real problems like rorquals and skill injectors.You can nerf caps all you want , that will just increase the N+1 effect,mine more and inject more cap pilots
---
Wormholer btw?
---
&gt; as it shits on the elitists who think nano is the only viable playstyle in the game
---
nano *is* the only viable playstyle in the game for non blob pvp however, and that is not the case to spite the cap drones, it's precisely because of them. Go ask those "elitists" if they enjoy flying overpropped and snaked shit just to be able to survive on grid with fucking brave of all people, or if they wouldn't love to be able to brawl.
---
&gt; any ship which costs under 500m and is not a cruiser is a non viable playstyle
---
what are you even talking about
---
&gt; You should try to get dudes onboard with liking diffrent gameplay instead of just shittin on theirs and gloryfying your own. 
---
oh yes the feelings of the overwhelming opressive force in the game were hurt because they were told that pressing f1 is indeed just pressing f1.
---
If the mining aspect was taken away, i wouldn't use it.back the orca and hulk for me
---
We've won with this shit too.
---
You don't have to go back very far to realize we've won in the current meta more than we've lost.
---
how do you feel about these 2 changes Ive been thinking about
---
1) Change rorq panic/cyno interaction such that you cannot have both modules active at once. You either have to choose to panic and wait for your allies to save you, or you forgo your panic and cyno to get fax/help immediately
---
2) Make ansiblex jump gates give blue timer, but not orange. This way it fits in CCPs vision of allowing empires to move fleets/assets quickly, but makes it harder titan bridge before/after taking gates.  Another change would possible to not allow using ansiblex gates with an orange timer active.
---
Thoughts??
---
Awwww look at the cute little alliances fight each other
---
He is just mad because cfc  and  test have no balls  and dont like to use their  supers. against panfam. That  is the  biggest problem  of the  game. Since  casino war  whole  imperium  loose  their balls. Same  btw. for  Panfam. Each  big  entity  use his supers only for  near field action  they can  easily win.
---
It does not follow eve's basic balance principle:
---
*Big ships are bad at killing small ships.*
---
or more precisely, *All classes have a weakness against another class.*
---
* Battleships are great at killing each other and bigger things but not great at killing frigs and cruisers.
---
* Battle-cruisers and cruisers are great at killing each other and bigger but are generally bad at killing destroyers and frigates.
---
* Destroyers are good at killing frigates but usually bad at anything larger.
---
There are of course exceptions to these rules, but generally one class is good at killing a certain class but weak against others. Some ships can make sacrifices to be good at killing smaller ships (RLML, RHML, grapplers/webs) but that is what they are, sacrifices. 
---
A capital generally does not need to make any sacrifices at all to be good at killing anything. Supers, carriers and dreads are strong against any of the subcap classes, with almost no weaknesses of their own.
---
The exception here is HAW dreads, which have to choose between good damage vs caps or good damage vs anything else.
---
So what I'm seeing here is that obviously we need more capital hulls.   With different types of play and counter play,   to give us more options!   
---
Yay for more caps!  
---

---
I can't tell if you don't know what hardly means or playing 4D chess
---
&gt; this is it, this is the point, every side in the game has now lost at some point to capitals.
---
Do you realize how retarded you sound?
---
even though i'm not a fan of capitals, this made me chuckle.
---
no u
---
delete all supers.
---
Rebuilding dreads to feed to anticap astra ‘s 😃
---
Still can't add my character, but the fitting tool is great. 
---
except all those bosons that kill subs even before you can lock them.
---
My meaning: you are just mad because cfc  and  test have no balls  and dont like to use their  supers. Against panfam. That  is the  biggest problem  of the  game. Since  casino war  whole  imperium  loose  their balls. Same  btw. for  Panfam. Each  big  entity  use his supers only for  near field action  they can  easily win.
---
&gt; TEST focus has been to focus heavily on getting their supers and caps fleet up to a serious size which it is now. Yet he is asking for supers nerfs ...
---
I mean I'm affiliated with the biggest supercap blob in the game right now and if you fucking deleted supers and titans tomorrow I'd legitimately ponder playing again, because the supercap meta has been stupid as fuck for like 10 years now. 
---
&gt;while not touching the real problems like rorquals and skill injectors.
---
If you want to make sure no one can ever catch Goons, the best way to do that would be to Nerf the mechanics they used to build their alliance before anyone else gets to use it.
---
You're not going to get supercaps deleted.  Your not going to get them completely nerfed to irrelevance. It's never going to happen.
---
You'll have a lot more success limiting the use case for supercaps while leaving the ability for people who don't have them to get them.
---
This is a terrible post.
---
Just to add, I also think removing the crazy tank is better than removing panic. Like ideally it should be easy to force a rorq to panic, and thereby generate a subcap engagement (because supers aren't the optimal response). Even if the rorqual doesn't die, it's the response and escalation chain that is interesting. 
---
Contrast with now, aka "bring 50 guys or don't undock, then cyno up and here come the bap mobiles". 
---
They can can be powerful, just make losing one meaningful instead of mining it back under a day.
---
"jihad" fuckers...
---
Increase the fuel size for cynos by x5
---
This needs to be higher 
---
This sounds like something eko would ssay in his day28 of goon bots not being banned
---
depends what you want to do
---
I feel like this is a threat. If I don't debate you win, but if I do debate I have to talk to a guy who named himself ProGodLegend so I still lose. 
---
Are you in rote?  
---
Cause that's fucking hilarious coming from a pilot in rote.
---
&gt; exactly the type of person the game needs
---
What do highsec miners provide for the game?
---
They don't create content for anyone but CODE. The amount of minerals they mine is neglible compared to actual nullsec miners. They don't join fleets, take space or do anything else interesting.
---
No, the game does not *need* more highsec miners.
---
not everywhere, embrace it, become a bad wh man
---
As a brawler for most of my EVE career, i can confirm brawling is on its last limbs as a valid form of fitting. Its incredibly tiring having to zkill check every person in local to see if they have a cyno to drop a carrier on you with. Even past capitals, you're at the full mercy of the blob when brawling. So even if capitals weren't a thing, you still have a large blob to deal with. Without capitals though (not to say they'd be removed, but just as a thought exercise), i'd say brawling could still survive in well designed comp against a blob. Just the eclipse of the capital umbrella is upon you anytime you commit to a scram.
---
Far not in every fight... Also if I were you I really wouldn't be so sure about that. TEST and Imperium have basically every alt inside the alliances, while most northern alliances have their farming character outside.
---
Additionally, neither TEST nor Imperium can be reliably beaten inside their super umbrella. This would change a lot, if supers/titans lost their ability to deal with everything. And this kind of warfare is what decides fights, wars etc. Not the "all hands on deck", which you see coming for 5 days.
---
Hey fweddit is your blackops wing still named bokk ops? Because I loved that.

That can be debated and I don't care about it.

But biggest.
---
I care
---
PGL's Reddit campaign begins!
---
Always the same argument."If we nerf rorquals how will other catch up to goons?".They won't.Nobody will.You can even start buffing them and Goons will still be kings cause they have the most people mining.
---
Imperial Legacy, Tapirium, beloved child has many names.
---
thank you
---
Generally speaking I don't like how mandatory multiboxing alts is at the high end. Why bother making an MMO?
---
Inb4 someone really likes multiboxing and I'm retarded: there's a difference between allowing multiboxing and making doing that the best course of action. For instance WoW (regardless of expansion) had multiboxers but nobody ever expected you to do it.
---
While a lot of the ideas you present here fine andlikely agreed on by a good amount of people that understand the game, the fact that you're addressing and only trying to push the specific things that are currently hurting your fleets and your coalition's gameplay makes this attempt a bit too hypocritical and for it to gain a large amount traction.
---
There are far worse issues in the game, some of which were already being pointed out decently well in the other thread.
---
A prime example of this which should go well beyond even a capital and Ferox rebalance in priority is the current state of a supposed high-risk high-reward mining ship being introduced to the game a few years ago, that has long since had it's risk-portion almost completely removed by the largest entities in the game. A couple regions in the game are currently spitting out minerals at a rate that is completely fucking the game's economy and causing a significant of side-effects, largely including the ones what you're complaining about as well in the form of capital proliferation, and some of the most powerful fleet combat doctrines in the game effectively costing nothing post-insurance, making N+1 a pretty absolute deciding factor in any fleet engagement with half-decent FC's at the helm. 
---
The biggest root cause is the fact CCP has almost completely removed diminishing returns from regional resource harvesting, making it possible for tens of thousands of people to mine within the same 6LY supercapital umbrellas. The bizarre thing is that CCP even implemented a system that added site respawn timers, and then never iterated on it again when the respawn timers clearly weren't enough, and by adding normal ores to moon pulls on top of that for some bizarre reason.
---
This being the optimal way of resource harvesting promotes blobbing up both regionally and coordination-wise into a few megacoalitions to an absolutely ridiculous extent, instead of remaining in smaller groups looking to carve a path for themselves. For small groups, and independent players that just want to make ISK for themselves, the choice that offers the maximal amount of utility for the smallest amount of effort has become joining the biggest megacoalition that exists at the time,  and it's the optimal choice by quite an extreme margin for harvesting resources.
---
Unlike the narrative goons (and some Test) tend to push, I don't believe people don't have any kind of innate tendency to join huge player group blobs of mostly non-likeminded people, unless they get something out of it. Eve has traditionally always favored large groups for defence and security due to the game's pvp mechanics always favoring N+1 due to there being little viable and non-counterable AOE mechanics (especially after the introduction of defender launchers), no diminishing returns on N+1 fleet members, any kind of significant friendly fire mechanics, being able to anchor and warp 254 people almost perfectly synced on 1 person ETC.
---
This has always been the case, but unlike before where megacoalitions would have to split over multiple regions, which reduced their safety and caused conflicts, the fact that resource harvesting no longer has significant diminishing returns from blobbing everyone under the same supercapital umbrella simply breaks the risk-reward system of resource harvesting safety.
---
Furthermore the design promotes and might eventually lead Tranquility into a somewhat nightmarish Serenity-like state, with one megacoalition being the only one large enough to protect their members' assets.
---
The catch is, that by now the game's economy is so fucked by letting this go on for years, that I don't even know what would fix it anymore, outside of creating a new line of ships that's mostly independent of conventional minerals and completely powercreeps our current ships. If CCP simply removed rorquals with no new alternative of harvesting resources as efficiently(which would preferrably gain no synergy from being in a huge blob this time around) the people who have been taking advantage of this broken system would simply keep the comparative advantage from it, but at least there would be some incentive to spread out from the current state of huge megacoalitions mining with non-existant diminishing returns in a single region again, adding risk back to a currently high-reward and risk-free ship.
---
TLDR: Mostly good ideas that promote changes that are badly needed, but you likely won't get much (or at least my) support for them until you address the mechanics that are even more broken that your coalition is benefitting from instead of just addressing the ones hurting you.
---
hear, hear
---
Trust me, you don't.
---
..but... hivemind...
---
I agree, the problem is not the power, the problem is that we have *so* many of them
---
Should we trust someone using light green on white tho?

I do like the fact that hisec is the stage for all this action. Refreshing

If it makes you this salty I'll double my output.

Hell yeah it is.  Saanguine still does fleets if you recognize that name.
---
I always ask for feedback on my videos and it has always been “add comms” to an overwhelming degree. It seems like everything else is preference. You will always have people who hate your music or love your music, people who think the video is too slow, some who want it faster (hard balance to hit). Comms always seem to be unanimous though.
---
This is how SpongeBob got his pineapple home. Through jihad!
---
&gt;They won't.Nobody will.

Of course not,because instead of trying everyone would prefer to play Fortnight and cry on Reddit.

Fuck it. I don't give a shit. I already have my Titan, Super and personal Fax cache.

Nerf rorqs and skill injectors.

Remember when there was a blops target every \~1hr during peak time? Was right about the time we stopped looking for targets that it ended. COINCIDENCE?!?!
---
What if cyno inhibs were buffed?  If dropping one could keep caps out of a subcap battle reliably?
---
I haven't thought much about this, so there's bound to be unintended consequences, but off the top of my head:
---
 * Cyno inhibs work system-wide
---
 * Cyno inhibs disable capitals travelling via gate into the system where they are active
---
Something like that?
---
&gt; Also, what is a Siren?
---
Support fighter that warp disrupts.  Essentially a near infinite range warp disruptor.

Jump fatigue. It fixed over-saturation of capitals. Bring it back and make it hurt. There have to be consequences to actions or nothing will ever change.
---
Unreadable, lines aren’t straight. 
---
Lol PGL's war is so holy, he took down his response thread out of piety.
---
Anyway, bants aside, I think what it all basically boils down to is this.
---
A cheap, smaller ship should have either 1) the opportunity to kill a larger, more expensive ship if flown with sufficient skill/luck or 2) have the opportunity to run from a larger, more expensive ship if flown with sufficient skill/luck.
---
Any viable solution should in some way incorporate one or both of ideas. 
---
Yeah let's ask silver miner about barges
---
you can't tackle supply-side issues without handling botting as well
---
lmfao what "days" are you referring to. Back in the "day" a big cap fight was lucky to see less than a dozen caps shooting another dozen caps. It was extremely rare to get those monumental fights people gush over. 
---
No, it's too late for that. There are too many anyway and even if they would be at a reasonable price, they would still be pretty oppressive toward, well, every subcap types of engagement.
---
Exactly.  How do I get you promoted in PL.  Who do I have to talk to?
---
All it took was the thumbnail of the vid to make me burst out laughing at work. Thanks for this. 
---
NCPL are the biggest anti goon block.    SkillUself  maybe . 
---
This is a good post.
---
Just delete supercaps and prevent remote reps on carriers when NSA is active. We can go back to having capital brawls with dreads/triage/carriers where everybody gets to frag shit. That's far better than the current whoever puts supers on grid absolutely demolishes their opponent.
---
Lots of people said this would happen though.  Lots.

The catch is, that by now the game's economy is so fucked by letting this go on for years, that I don't even know what would fix it anymore, outside of creating a new line of ships that's mostly independent of conventional minerals and completely powercreeps our current ships.
---
If CCP simply removed rorquals with no new alternative of harvesting resources as efficiently(which would preferrably gain no synergy from being in a huge blob this time around) the people who have been taking advantage of this broken system would simply keep the comparative advantage from it, but at least there would be some incentive to spread out from the current state of huge megacoalitions mining with non-existant diminishing returns in a single region again, adding risk back to a currently high-reward and risk-free ship.

@here /r/eve/new
---
&gt;What would I have done?  
---
&gt;For starters engaged on my own terms- his fleet was only good in that one spot. After that not feed it.
---
And then you would not have had any fight at all. If he got his NPC support fleet in a suitable location, you can savely assume that he can relocate them, either at will or at least partially.   
---
So, since you can not force him to fight without his NPC crew, what are you going to do? Retreat, no fight or fight and possibly lose? Well, we can see what his opponents did, they did the good thing and engaged. Frankly, I like that better than the other option.   
---
I mean, I understand the hate for capitals (somewhat), but saying "but it's only a frigg" is a bit missplaced here. 
---
Great rebuttal there friend'o
---
Whats the over/under on the bet
---
Stop.
---
This. Even if they were more expensive to lose (removing insurance, increasing build times, changing costs to build, skillpoint loss on destruction, etc), they are too effective at too many different jobs. Their job should be more focused.
---
Oh gods I can see it now... Burn Jita with Citadels.....
---
What about making caps vulnerable to ewar like jamming?  That could help, if implemented carefully.
---
Longer than PGL’s post lasted before getting deleted
---
Apparently you're the guy that drops caps on a single frigs because you cant figure anything else out. That's cool I guess, have fun with it.
---
I can gladly admit I dont fully know how all online forums work, not this one either. I read r/eve occasionally on reddit and created the account to follow r/eve because I like EVE.  But I sure as shit dont feel any pressure to be "cool" here. It just reeks to high heaven of serious  insecurity issues having to put down people for completely innocuous posts or comments. A complete waste of time and excess negative energy too.  It just makes people look a tad more juvenile than absolutely necessary...
---
TFW a krab empire FC complaining about capitals in all the wrong ways.
---
Your weekend Keepstar ganks are irrelevant. So are your problems with GTFO and burst projectors and such. If you want to fix capitals and the meta you start with how much risk and time it takes to get one. To do that, you fix unchecked and unbalanced farm. To do that, you fix supercap umbrellas. To do that, you fix anom respawns and mobile cyno inhibition mechanics.
---
Fighters are OP. Boson is OP. But nerfing them won't fix much. The stale meta continues until someone does something about how the only right way to play the sov null mega empire game is blobbing up in a single region with the largest supercap umbrella.
---
I used to fly with NC (no dot) and cap fights were regularly 100-200.  Before they changed sanctums to be "literally nothing outside of -0.3".
---
I might be missing it. 
---
Well, you're mostly right. Deleting bosons seems a bit extreme, though. GTFO is cancer in tidi fights. It happened to many in Hakonen with Goons/TEST vs PanFam and that ended any further fighting for anyone booshed to the middle of nowhere. In 10% tidi, there's no recovering from that. I'm just curious, have if you evver laid out and articulated this case to CCP at all as a CSM rep I voted for with 4 accounts twice. 
---
Wew asking a pet to give up their pet status
---
Is it vote brigading if I upvote all your posts because you're my EvE boss?

You're arguing against a literal NPC dude. He's been fed so much spod flavored koolaid about ELITE PVPERS he doesn't even know his keyboard has button besides f1
---
Skillpoint totals don't update until there's a change in the state of the skill queue, it's always been like this.
---
Time on a skill ticks down until completion, but the skillpoints aren't calculated and applied until a state change in the skill queue such as pausing it, editing it or changing what skill you're training etc.
---
This will lead to lower cached total SP values in your character sheet until a calculation occurs, then it'll jump to the correct value :)
---
Indoctrination at its finest 
---
back in the day when i started playing my corp of a dozen dudes in lowsec had 100 caps ready to go cmon john..
---
In cap vs subcap relation we do have good balance points scattered around - HAW dreads in vacuum serve a role that is both useful and not overwhelming (as effective tool to deal with mainfleet ships), and for supers/carriers main issue is not their raw strength, but how universally useful they are in majority of situations; you can't properly prepare to deal with carriers/supers as of now, outside bringing more. HAW titans are strong only because FAXes are strong and being able to quickly refit for targeted Doomsday + cap guns makes it possible to deal with supposed counter (dreadbomb) attempts, supers deal insane amount of damage to everything, and carriers are able to overwhelm almost any subcapital fleet while having smaller numbers total.
---
I wonder how the meta would change if carriers and supers were delegated away from mainline DPS role and more towards strictly antisupport role (big dps nerf, light fighter application buff, volley damage nerf compensated by RoF buff, generally that direction) - direct full on nerfs will either not change much or make entire ship class obsolete (kind of like HAW dreads are now), while role-targeted changes might cause some interesting stuff to happen over time (going in direction I mentioned I could see CS/T3C/HAC being dedicated carrier counter subcap doctrines) to both cap and subcap meta. Currently a lot of fleet doctrine meta is centered around what is good against commonly used ships, making that relation more complicated and cutting down "universally good" stuff will always make large fleet meta more interesting.
---
As for T1 ships, there is nothing wrong with fighting in them and they serve certain roles well; the problem might arise if at any point T1 spam could be considered overall best strategy by any group out there - strong T1 proliferation means large losses are irrelevant and it's simply not worth the time and effort to try and pin down enemy fleet instead of just forcing them off. About a year ago there was the case of NC. Machariel fleet getting trapped in Catch by Legacy and all the story about them having to extract ships via safety (and effectively getting those ships locked in safety for over 3 weeks), and that is something I'd love to see more - situations when bringing expensive stuff that is hard to quickly replace (due to ISK, build time, market size etc.) is both viable and exploitable at the same time. It both adds to variety and creates good incentive to try even more to get good results when you know that causing other side to lose what they bring will have actual meaning.
---
Note that last point is kind of my personal preference - good fights are fun, but winning also is fun, and for me win or loss is about time/effort needed to recover; so that part might differ between players. I'd just find it more fun to have the ability to outship for reduced risk at higher potential cost, while also having the option to actively work to maximize that loss for whoever I'm fighting against.

Capitals are just part of the equation. The entire ecosystem of eve is fucked right now - changing capitals without changing supply dynamics and the need for large, secure, stationary empire space where people can endlessly rat and mine would accomplish nothing. This is the player cycle in NS right now:
---
1) Rorquals are powerful. You want to mine, so you buy a rorqual, often PLEXing and injecting because "I'll make it back in a couple months then never have to spend money on this game again". They are vulnerable, so you get some friends with capitals to protect you.
---
2) You mine far too much to dump into subcaps or modules, and the margins aren't very high. So you build caps. More likely, you sell to someone who buys your ore for increasingly lower and lower prices, as they are already sitting on a stockpile of caps, supers, and high-cost goods.
---
3) Your friends buy caps and now there are more to protect you.
---
4) Their friends hear how safe your space is and bring their rorquals/the dudes carrier ratting or doing any other shitty isk making activity see how much isk you're making and buy rorquals themselves, often PLEXing and injecting because "I'll make it back in a couple months then never have to spend money on this game again". Return to 1.
---
Rorquals mean caps/supers which create safe space which means rorquals which...
---
I'm all for what PGL wants to accomplish. He's just the wrong messenger. You cannot seriously sit in Esoteria, surrounded by rorquals and super ratters in every system, and argue that capitals are the problem because you got spanked across the universe in someone else's backyard. /u/CSMprogodlegend if you want something to change, you gotta start at home. Be the change you want to see in the game.
---
A boosting/mobile compression platform was its original use, never mining.
---
If your friend is smart, he will ditch you and join Lewak, then they will come gank you. 
---
The same guy did both of these.
---
I agree with this guy. Remove all remote reps in game.
---
No meaningful capital nerf can take place wiyhout nerfing the rorqual. Without that any balance becomes obsolete in hours.
---
Then they redesigned it, and then ccp said it’s a boosting ships providing strong fleet support AND have strong mining capabilities on its own. Ships can change there roles you know 
---
That's how you get exactly opposite effect - the side that already has grid advantage is able to force taking down/placing cyno inhib, but only after their capital reinforcements land in system; and that makes those caps virtually untouchable. It'd make caps use even more of one-sided swing than it is now.
---
Well the issue is probably not that capitals are too good and subcaps aren't or anything.
---
The issue we have is, that EVE is running for a long time and people gathered money, alot of money. Alliances remain the same most of the time and build up huge structures which they can easily defend in their home systems. So building 24/7 capitals ships like others build subcaps, just increases the numbers. So throwing capitals on people is basically as easy as any other ship, just more effiecient, it's still a captial ship, so it should be better then a subcap in most cases.
---
You can only turn this back, by having huge wars, where people commit capitals, until they are running low on them and have to get back to subcap fleets, where caps are used only in special occasions.
---
I mean right now it's capitals, lets pass 4-5 years and people will throw supers like the throw caps today. 200 nyxes, 200 titans, or maybe even pirate supers by then ... 100 komodos or something, who knows.
---
Hard to reverse that trend right now.
---
This is awesome work!
---
Looks a little like what we put together for Frigates of EVE, although we used the old model for the Burst, as the new one wasn't ready.
---
Seeing this reminded me of the 14 month long slog that I had writing all the tech backstory for the book haha. Was so much fun!
---
If you're interested in seeing what's inside ships in EVE, shoot me an email with your shipping details and I'll mail you a copy of Frigates of EVE :)

&gt; Spectrum War
---
Read that as "speculum war"
---
That is a great video. Thanks for sharing 
---
Agree!
---
It's basically the Nail and the hammer problem... You need a cruiser to do that? Capital!
---
You need a Battleship to do that? Yeah, that's right, CAPITALs!
---
When every problem is a nail that needs a hammer, bringing the biggest fucking hammer is always the right answer... if you have the mega hammer, might as well use it. :(
---
Which key do you use to shoot your weapons?
---
Yeah it's pretty bad. I can't remember the last time we were in a gang and got a fight that didn't end with someone getting butt salty and dropping a capital.
---
stop making me like you with your cool videos and your good points
---
So... capitals should be reserved for the worst game play (structure bashing) in game? That doesn't sound like punishment at all.
---
I mean, we had dominion sov and POS warfare, and everyone bitched that caps &amp; supers were too good at grinding structures and had too much DPS, so we got citadel mechanics with damage caps and fozziesov instead. I wonder if people are finally realizing how much worse this system is, and particularly how shitty citadel mechanics are, for driving conflict.
---
Welcome to the game CCP chose to create.  Capitals Online.  Why even undock a subcap?  There's no reason, and if you do, you're just content for capital pilots.  
---
Ugh I can't stand WHs . I'd rather biomass 
---
FAXs are not the problem why do people keep thinking faxes are the problem. The problem is the risk free spamming of faxes. Yes fax csn use a nerf. But with the rorqual it costs literaly minutes to replace fax losses. RORQUALS ARE THE PROBLEM. fix rorquals then you can rebalance the rest. 
---
I think the problem hes pointing to is that you can do too much with caps. Sirens, GTFOs etc give the cap fleet to much control. The control is where the subcap fleet is supposed to come from (i assume)
---
The game is 15+ years old and as much as some people want to argue Skill injectors and rorqs are the problem, without those the game can't survive.
---
There is so much more choice for a gamer why would they chose EVE  where they have to wait literally years to fly some ships.
---
Came here expecting shitpost.  Pleasantly surprised.
---
So you still agree that caps, subcaps, and structures are balanced on the whole rock paper scissors thing right now, but you want them to be matched in the opposite direction.
---
Sorry, but I like the current meta where caps and supers duke each other out. It is simply more fun even as a bystander. I want to see caps being the ships-of-the-line, the spearhead of alliance/coalition-level warfare. It is boring to hoard all those cool ships behind hangers and only using it as a siege weapon on stationary targets.
---
Good fights, make enough isk to buy ships to blow up, cloaky fun (I &lt;3 Black ops), chill with cool dudes. 
---
After reading through the sub, it sounds like alliance Vs alliance wars are really boring/non existent.
---
Caps were more fun when there was less isk in the game.  Years ago when I got my first carrier, I remember thinking how can I possibly drop this thing?  I might lose it and it cost billions of isk which I couldnt easily replace.  Now, Just about everyone I know has a super.  Suicide dreads are a dime a dozen, and carriers and faxes are cheap.  If you lose something its instantly replaced.  As a result, there is no discretion anymore in dropping things - if it moves it gets dropped and correspondingly, the excitement of actually risking something has been lost.  Kinda makes the whole thing meh.
---
Cool to see Fweddit still alive, first corp I ever joined was with them out in Cloud Ring
---
Considering the Rorq proliferation out in null, HiSec miners are fairly insignificant anymore. So, CODE ‘s whole motif has no point anymore. Unless it really is just to gank n00bs in very low-risk PvP.
---
Yea pretty much. Get a tank and a repper and then drone ships. Just have to pay attention to spawns and local.
---
But what about the Oxford comma?
---
In a world of damage caps and sov wands, what else is there for Caps to do but shoot caps and sub caps?
---
Now is a moment in time, we are in the realms of then where clearly release was implied. If he wanted it to stay longer a clear timeline would have been stated
---
If a CSM member thinks that CCP wont have the balls to do whats right and nerf the rorqual then why are we still investing time into a game that will destroy himself.
---
Great work!
---
Dude I was the guy FCing most of those fleets for TEST while Progod was off being busy for a couple days for a month. That wasn't what happened at all. The jammers worked in our favour lol.
---
How does something that happened a year and a half ago when you were much weaker dictate what you're doing today while far stronger?
---
Certainly viable. I've been on both sides of NC. In the past and had good experiences.
---
Yeah. I was referring to the original usage, which was fleet support.
---
Agreeing with you, by all means, fuck rorq mining

For years its been some form of NC. and goons standing off against each other while PL would go around and suppress any potential up and comers.

Lets not pretend that anything today isnt the players own fault.

Hey look its pos mechanics and dominion sov!

---
Fuck skill injectors too
---
To late already posted. 
---
Even in the old NC those fights weren’t fights. One side would bring a massive number and the other side would stand down as is the age old tradition. The actual fights where you shoot something for more than a siege cycle were rare. 
---
I have been looking for a BLOPS group as well but haven't found anything outside of Bombers Bar which is a NPSI (not purple shoot it) so not a corp or alliance just randos and goon alts that meet up together in a wormhole and rageroll for rorquals.
---
If you find a corp or alliance doing a lot of blops activity pm me please
---
Backwards....  We don't stop until we get something big enough to warp backwards.
---
Of course that doesn't happen, that'd require paying someone that doesn't generate direct profit and Hilmar would never do something like that.
---
do you know how many times I've done TIS, The Meta show, Shit on Kugu, Open Comms, etc. etc. etc.
---
I never said I wouldn't do those shows.
---
Ive had more fun the last 2 years in EVE than the previous 5.
---
So make of that what you will.
---
&gt; we had dominion sov and POS warfare, and everyone bitched that caps &amp; supers were too good at grinding structures
---
Then they halved the EHP of said structures to the point that no objective took more than 15 minutes with a 100 man fleet
---
&gt; so we got citadel mechanics with damage caps and fozziesov instead
---
Everyone in the game from Brave to PL said fozziesov sucked after testing it before it was even on TQ. There was also an entire year between the release of those 2 things.
---
You're right but I don't think you're outlining it very well.
---
are you actually saying tis is a good platform for anything 
---
I'm glad to see that you haven't let your illiteracy get in the way of your Reddit posting.
---
Truly an inspiration.
---
Wormhole space and some NPC 0.0 regions still have a decent amount of subcap fights.
---
So, what you're saying, is that capitals need a niche they shine in instead of being universally strong? I can agree with that.
---
I must have gotten lucky then, most of the fights where caps were involved often had plenty of solid wings to them, with 100+ caps being dropped on both sides.
---
I did leave the alliance after the debachle in Geminate where we pushed DRF out of all but two systems, only to reclaim a station so GYPSY could undock a shitton of freighters and get their stuff out and we were told "We're not keeping this system."  We rally and fight for a month after a DRF spy flips Geminate from one of our renters, only for us to just walk away?
---
NC collapsed not even a month after that moment.
---
&gt; The game is 15+ years old and as much as some people want to argue Skill injectors and rorqs are the problem, without those the game can't survive.
---
Bud EVE was hitting its 10 year anniversary when I started playing and had plenty of people playing without any of those things. The trend you're discussing is not the culmination of 15 years, just the last two.
---
The real question is
---
If this doesn't work are you going to eat hot wings to pay for your failure?
---
Here's [an actually legible version, mirror, copy](https://i.imgur.com/ZWwMbtC.png), etc. I hate you OP
---
Disband TAPI. I agree.  
---
awox the whole alliance
---
I'm kind of embarrassed the most I had was 4, and in a Nereus...
---
tee hee could use some love (upvotes NOW) guys pls xd uwu rawr dx
---
You are dumb.  Jump fatigue alters the defender/attacker balance, not the capitals/subcapitals balance.
---
If you have 5 fax, you can save 5 ratters per hour, if you have 20 fax, you can save 20 ratters per hour.  
---
This is a classic example of missing the root cause.
---
Focus on what you want people to be doing and why they are not doing it.  Not what they are currently doing.
---
I have no issues shooting Pred in game.
---
Pandemic Legion- they’re the training alliance for Horde
---
No one is going to bring up valid points against the argument that capital balance has been bad. But if your goal is to refresh Eve, the focus should be on breaking down the large coalitions and having conditions that foster more conflict on a smaller scale.
---
And also, there are more than 1 or 2 "real battles" a month. Have you seen the BRs coming from the Min-Amarr WZ, Derelik, Provi? No they are not 500B Max TiDi snorefasts - rather low or NO TiDi, 50-100b, 100 v 100, fights where almost everyone enjoys themselves. Even a recent fight against Snuff wasn't ~terrible~. These fights happened outside of supercapital umbrellas and coalitions that can flash form 300+ nerds.
---
oh fuck off
---
Imagine the North without their Supers. Vs 2000 Goons on an average Weekday.lol
---
Is that by being part of the large null sec blocks? 
---
Thats what I am doing for the most part, i'm basing myself out of a low sec one for now, getting ready to move into a wh.
---
Please help, I'm being killed by a ship that I can't afford/can't be bothered to train into.
---
nothing wrong here. I heard /r/eve is the official TEST forum. so  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 
---
More evidence PGL is a 5 year old in a man's body.
---
Ravens are badass, yes. But their strength lies in reffing a structure (fortizar or larger) under a supercap fleet - NOT fighting the supercap fleet itself. 
---
Actually, horde is a great example of what you _should_ do at home. I'm not saying horde is perfect, or doesn't drop caps at a whim, or doesn't rorq mine till their noses bleed. But if you show up in O-V there is a philosophy of fighting. There's a mutual understanding that if you show up to fight (as opposed to invade), you'll get a fight. To a lesser extend, GE-8 is this way as well, but there there is a tendency to call for backup when things get too spooky. 
---
Just embrace the fight. Encourage people in your alliance who want to take fights because fights are fun. Discourage people from dropping supers on everything moves. Get people out of rorquals and into ships. Or make cringey calls for Jihad to your alliance every time you lose a fight to caps while changing nothing. 
---
Actually seems like a descent summation of the core issues with balance atm. Well done
---
It was suggested by this user to introduce sp loss to capitals -&gt;
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/agwhnn/ccp_it_is_more_than_time_to_put_t3c_skill_loss_to/ee9jlam?utm_source=reddit-android
---
The idea really resonates with md although I have a biased wh opinion. I think it is worth some discussion whether it would be a reasonable solution or not.
---
&gt;When a new person posts on reddit on what to do, or how to start their own corp, its almost always met with "Join Goons, Horde, TAPI etc".
---
Yeah, it's too bad you're permanently locked into the first alliance you join.  Oh wait....
---
The reason people are given this advice is the big alliances have the logistics to support new players extremely well (ie. mentoring, free ships, frequent fleets), and someone is doing almost every part of the game within those alliances.  Which means the new players get exposed to a much broader slice of the game with sufficient support to keep them playing long enough to stick with the game.
---
Once they've got that exposure they can figure out what they like, and change corps appropriately.
---
&gt; Considering the Rorq proliferation out in null
---
I've heard about this, sounds like it could totally unbalance the mining economy in the long run.
---
Seem to be spinning the retard just fine friend
---
Wow u just don't want the little guy to have a chance in null...
---
Nah it's really easy to reverse that trend. Nerf capital application across the board and people will go back to flying subcaps. 
---
I just want them out of low sec.  Remove the ability for Carriers/Dreads/etc to cyno in LS (allow JFs and the like to remain the same as now so they can seed markets) so that they have to go gate to gate.  That'd stop the cancer that is caps in LS FW space.  
---
Couple nights ago a DNG fleet was trying to flip Rous when a Phoebe got dropped on the 10ish man Vexor fleet.  Once we attacked it, all sorts of other caps joined in and blue balled everyone.  Fuck that
---
PGL has gone full Romo and will now be able to predict our opponent's movement and tactics with deadly precision.
---
Your move atheists.
---
&gt;This means, alliances who arent tapping their regions hard enough still get a chance to grow while those who are tapping the hell out of it have to spread out alot.
---
Thus the alliances that are spreading out will conquer the ones who aren't sufficiently tapping their regions.  And we'll finally have the actual blue doughnut.
---
&gt; structures needed to clear hostile structures
---
There is a line suggesting you almost wrote that
---
I didnt say that the jammers did not work in our favor, I did say that the only reason they won was because they could just bring their supercap fleet in and no one could touch them regardless of how many subs you have.
---
We held out an entire month because of the jammers and then we collapsed and gave up after we lost ihubs and with it the jammers so they could just bring in their super fleet
---
&gt;How does something that happened a year and a half ago when you were much weaker dictate what you're doing today while far stronger?
---
Context my dude, the guy I replied to complained about us being blue to goons, we activly worked on our relationship with goons as soon as we settled into eso because if NCPL would have decided to follow us they could have just evicted us because the entire thing would have repeated itself. An "anti extinction pact"
---
Now yes, we arent (that much) reliant on the goon super fleet anymore to prevent us from being evicted if they wanted to but goons could just evict us if they wanted so why would we risk it? 
---
Something something self preservation
---
i think you are missing the bottom right corner of the triangle
---
Eve is about keeping up with the Jones, if you don't you will get stomped. If everyone else has caps, you will have to have them too. 
---
But real life war is the same, the side with the technologicial and/or numbers superiority ends up winning.
---
&gt;3.BTW what is this Praxis I bought under 100M ISK HOW CAN A SUBCAP BE SLOWER THAN A RAVEN
---
Well a Raven is a subcap
---
upvote for good post
---
Not quite right
---
CCP sells extractor, not injectors (besides alpha ones) .
---
I see a sale for extractors coming soon \*g\*
---
it's also boring to only fly caps because supers can volley subs
---
inb4 lol you just want to kill carriers in a rifter
---
Its what they used to do back in the day outside of critical mass. Shit i got exicted for sov war because i got to kill towers with my super and actually use it.
---
There are too many but you can't really remove them from the game other than getting people to blow them up. 
---
one of my favorite moments in eve is when elo baited his public fleet and we dropped on him in slippery petes and he couldnt figure out how to do anything
---
&gt;TEST why didn't you ham string yourself  when you fought us if you thought these mechanics were OP xd what a hypocrite
---
How fucking stupid can you be? 
---
also, PL bitching about getting blobbed with supers is fucking music to my ears 
---
The old guard were playing, for new players the retention was awful. I chat to ALOT of new players they always have, and still do talk about the insane catch up. 
---
Im going to make an assumption and i maybe wrong but i think CCP decided on changes when they saw what PL were doing to Hero in Catch. 
---
I want to ask you, if it meant CCP could scrap the legacy code and create a modern game,  would you still play eve if it had a complete restart?.
---
I've finally started to come around to the idea as i dont see anyway to resolve the different issues vets and new players have, or PVP and PVE players have.
---
I could but it would be fairly developer-centric and not all that straight forward for anyone who isn't a programmer. But if you're a programmer or just all around a savvy individual, then it shouldn't be too hard to host locally.
---
Can't argue with geometry
---
It's some sick ass yarn tho

According to the OP, you would drop caps to fight a structure (boring) but then the enemy would have to engage you with either subs (fun for enemy, boring for you), or caps (fun for both). If they bring subs, then you have to counter with subs (fun for both), and if they bring caps then both sides have the choice of supplementing their fleet with subs, thus putting the enemy at a disadvantage. 
---
Worst (and most common) case, hostiles don't respond at all, in which case you get the reff done very quickly and/or with fewer people since presumably caps would have an easier time killing a structure. Everything checks out from what I can see. 
---
Supply and demand: less people live in rural Minmatar, less people come to buy on Rens, so many things are sold cheaper than Jita.
---
But some things(i.e. ships and T2 modules) were cheaper or more abundant on Jita(because more people come to sell them) so when I bought my first Maelstrom I had to make 22 jumps returning from Jita to Hek.
---
Then later I had to make about 30 jumps from Jita to wherever Thukker lives on Minmatar High-sec to bring Lv4 mission blitz Mach.
---
I wanted to self destruct.
---
Nothing says fun like having to minmax every ship in a roam instead of just dickin around with friends. It turned from "grab a ship that can roughly do x" to "we have yo have this to counter rammybois, this to counter fighters, 2 logis incase a haw dread, the dps to blap cyno baits, oh and 3 alts to make pings incase of bosons on gates."
---
Caps "relatively" suck against subcaps pre-citadel
---
But that doesn't mean they are good against caps
---
Back then it was only the dread blob
---
Good post apart from the light green.
---
Kendarr’s retardation aside, this game is more engaging the more dynamic fights are. 
---
Supers make the game less dynamic with their current balance, except for the people who happen to be in them. 
---
Changing supers and titans back to more of a cap and structure killing roll and less of an answer to every null and lowsec engagement would make fights more dynamic. 
---
Not saying death to all supers, but I do think this game was more fun when it was more diverse. 
---
i'm gay
---
at least the red isn't blinky
---
How about a T2 (or even T3) BS designed to be a cap killer?  
---
obviously thats how im feeling right now.  
---
Any alliance that claim they flossin' can bring your Ass on down to OV and start brawlin...  
---
I don't disagree that caps/supers are too powerful. I just find it funny as fuck that people are bringing it up now that goons/test have caught up/surpassed ncpl on numbers.  
---
Caps/supers/titans have been too powerful for YEARS, none of you complained when titans could DD subcaps, or when the wrecking ball was implemented, or when you could assign sentries and hide in a pos shield.  
---
Cry me a fucking river
---
&gt; It is simply more fun even as a bystander
---
As a bystander maybe. As someone who wants to play the game and fly subcaps, definitely not, because you get dropped on by bigger ships and you can't do anything about that.
---
Rock-paper-scissors with structures doesn't work because you can't roam with structures.
---
I LIKE CAPS SO MUCH, I EVEN WRITE IN CAPS!
---
YEAH, FUCK GAME BALANCE, I JUST GOT MY WTFPWNMOBILENYX AND WANT TO BASH NUBZ, EVERYTHING ELSE DOESN'T INTEREST ME!!!111
---
Was that what you wanted to tell us?
---
Its because the last 2 years of being in TEST have been a wild ride. 
---
We have gone from being traditional TEST to being the 1st genuine new superpower contender the games seen since the BoB days.
---
Its been a constant struggle to survive and grow and all the hard work finally paid off last year in UALX.
---
Players shouldn't even be allowed to advertise sales. We have markets and contracts with search and sorting functions for a reason. 99.99999999999% of the adverts are scams. 
---
Majority have done nano gangs to death and don't think that ganking ratters is interesting gameplay anymore.
---
just join a wh corp that actually operates and fights in wormholes
---
stay away from c2 /ns people, they're just ramming their heads into the kspace wall of total shit 
---
holy shit that intro tho! its one min long but didn't even notice it was so good
---
Sure, but a super fleet which isn't in range of anything isn't very useful. Its still negating trillions of isk of hardware for 50b or so.
---
are you just pretending to be retarded 
---
How much m3 you got? I might be able to help you out for a decent price. PM me. 
---
Right when pgl and Vily got down on their knees to suck mittens off...    
---
I actually like your RL parallel, because its a field that I am actually familiar with. While its true that superiority comes from tech+numbers, its not the only game in town. One of the reasons that the United States doesn't just sail a carrier fleet into the Straight of Hormuz is because while the Iranian's can't match the US Navy's big guns, their fleet of small, fast frigates and cruisers can wreak havok on the bigger ships, literally being too fast to pin down and able to plant explosives and otherwise cripple the carrier fleet.  They wont be able to win an extended fight, slugging it out by any means, but then, they aren't trying to.   
---
That is a simplification of an RL example, to be sure, but the idea is the same. There are counters that can be used effectively.  
---
&gt; also lets change caps and supercaps so blobbing with subcaps will be even more important, that will be great for the game for sure
---
It would be better for it than blobbing with capitals being the important thing.
---
We can't remove local chat scams from eve, that's our culture and tradition to see "Windin Gabby" spamming over and over that she's quitting the game and needs to sell her entire inventory for some reason
---
Didn't they try something like that at the sub cap level with the tier3 BCs that had BS weapon mounts (Naga, et al).
---
Damn thats well put together, true thats exactly the same reason why bountys are absolutely worthless.
---
You simply can't reward PvP kills since the system is exploitive as fck.
---
It sucks that dreads suck. The whole siege mode thing requires a rethink, and frankly I'd like to see a second dread added for each race to give options, mostly because some of the existing dread models are so godawful ugly people don't want to pilot them (I'm looking at you Moros).
---
The irony of this coming from PL.
---
The problem is that anything that is told to you now could be flooded 3-6 months from now.
---
The problem with sub caps v supers &amp; titans is that sub caps can't kill supers or titans. You can fix this by providing sub caps with Titan killing weapons. Need context? Well then,

Change the meta dramatically as has happened in real war.
---
5 Frigates if fit with super busting weapons should be able to kill a Titan fairly quickly, shake eve up a bit, FFS Every man has a Titan already and his dog a super, lets pop em all.
---
but, I did.  Though I get you're probably not including me in that group.
---
Wait until your excavs get spearfished by a booshing nanogang after NEAR doesn't warn you in time because they rolled in from a C2 with a nullsec static.
---
It was Locke, the REQ FC, with Seddow backseating him. Seddow spoke up twice I think, but it was Locke who FC'd most of the fleet.
---
Most are talking politics "shot talking", the others are talking game mechanics. Im guessing your talking about the game emchanics?
---
Those ~600 PLEX Skins are for capitals only, and Supers / Titans can easily farm those 2,5Bil ISK within 2 Days or so...
---
Capitalpilots may also pay with their credit card but usually we let highsec carebears or people who feel the need to buy themself into the game pay for our looks.
---
consider suicide
---
That all makes sense to me, damn im to deep in the rabbit hole
---
Im guessing a mixture of both no?

PGL's first twitch streaming video is out:
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3orjTQWmwc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3orjTQWmwc)
---
No, jump fatigue forced capitals to be more saturated in smaller areas. Jump fatigue is a stupid ass forced mechanic that was supposed to fix the problem of force projection. It did nothing to discourage the proliferation of caps, and if anything it just forced large entities to produce even more caps to have caches stored around the map.
---
Should have kept it shut down if this is what we're paying for...
---
Jihad.  Arabic word which literally means striving or struggling.
---
PGL is declaring he is going to struggle.  What's new?
---
this makes Elo's "war on bots" posts look good
---
&gt;Feels the need to post that a ship will indeed still be hard countered by the T3 variant of it's counter
---
Ok epic
---
No, I just find it very self serving to be able to use them and win a fight down south and be completely ok with the mechanics and not make some reddit post about it.
---
Turn the page to your northern deployment and get the shit kicked out of you, then go bitch to CCP that capitals are unbalanced
---
I don’t give a shit that you used them, it was just very interesting to see the liberal usage of them during the PL souther deployment when you guys clearly knew that PL was fighting with one hand behind their backs.
---
Next off, don’t empty quote some nonsense conjecture that I never said lmao
---
Literally a Leshak
---
Right, in that one situation. But if that super fleet is attacking your own structure, or your own capitals, or for whatever reason forcing you to engage the ships themselves and not whatever they're guarding, then Ravens by themselves just won't do the trick - no subs will, if only because they lack the damage to grind through the FAX wing in a reasonable amount of time. 
---
You literally just vote brigaded the first time, got your post removed, and reposted the exact same thing.  
---
Could you don't?
---
yea i never need to reload those, and they are totally perfect and take 10 seconds to refill cap, not like 5 minutes w/ 2 cap boosters in tandem 
---
Let me guess, you have lots of geckos for 1 million isk for sale. Lots of skins, modules, and BPs you are trying to sell for 9 billion when evepraisal says its worth nothing. 
---
There's no good reason to allow adverts in local. Almost none are legit. Players can use the search tools. Will save all our sanity.
---
Considering a nyx can 1 shot sabres and coast 1km/s... If you didn't have tackle ready to jump through a cyno it probably wasn't happening.
---
Yeah but I'm envisioning something like a Marauder but with anti cap guns.  
---
I am not. Can you imagine how different a reaction you'd be getting if you made this post 2-3 years ago?
---
This guy gets it.
---
Fair enough. Sieging structures is the one place I think most people are fine with Capitals being a good tool though, so I'm not sure I would change that.
---
Jita local scams are fine, but endlessly spamming the same message every 15 seconds is not.
---
One of the main reasons the corp I am in has left null-sec is due to the capital proliferation. We can't reasonably do small-gangs anymore without a capital being dropped AND being able to blap us. We've found that Faction Warfare seems to be the only place where we can still enjoy sub-cap game play.
---
Why's that?
---
I agree. I made a post awhile ago about comparison to Capitals and the older FOTY timespans. Drakes online/Ishtars online were OP in their respective field. Mainly Fleets. Infact drakes weren't even OP, they were just cheap as chips and easy to get people trained into.
---
The big difference between this FOTY/"Insert Ship" Online trope is that the Ishtar/Drake era, those ships were strong in 1 area, maybe 2. 
---
Ishtars were strong in fleets and PVE
---
Drakes were strong in fleets and in PVE (before drones got DDA's)
---
Ishtars were not appearing out of thin air and dropping on you, they were not solo pwn mobiles and were pretty easy to handle if a few were around.
---
Capitals on the other hand can appear out of thin air thanks to cynos, are oppressive in fleet and solo pvp and are also the #1 ship to get into to rat in. They are smothering all the meta's.
---
That being said, I could go on about balance and what needs to change, but we've been there before. What we need now is for CCP to start communicating with us about what they might want to do and so EVERYONE (capital pilots, small gang, fleet FC's, Wormhole, lowsec) can voice their opinions on if CCP is going in the right direction. Not just dump a nerf on us and either piss everyone off because it misses the point, or make them completely useless.
---
CCP has been unusually quiet lately, and maybe its because they're tired of being shit on all the time, or their 2 guys that interact with us are taking a breather, or there is just literally nothing interesting happening at the moment. Even if its 3 months out, tell us, lets us voice our opinions/concerns approval, so when the final product is released, everyone is
---
1. Happy or understanding of the reasons why
---
2. can provide their own perspectives on balancing it so its a proper balance and not a rush job
---
The whole HIC rebalance was a good indication that CCP needs more balance exposure before they make large sweeping changes so they aren't missing anything.
---
What about using scalable NPC mining response fleets as belt rats?  And maybe include bombers in the spawns?  Target the excavators, not the rorqs.  
---
The AI already exists in game, it's just not being applied to bigger belts, only asteroid belts.  
---
AFK miners lose excavators.  
---
Miners who aren't AFK have to engage in PVE content for maybe 10% of each hour which cuts down on ore mined.  
---
If there are 30 rorqs in the belt, maybe a shit ton of NPC ships show up (response fleet ships, not the crap which spawns in belts now).  They may not kill rorqs, but they would force the excavators to be pulled in which at least cuts down on the ore being mined.  
---
If only 1 rorq is mining, maybe a logi and two battleships show up.  Something basic.  
---
Not sure how this would apply for rorq fleets in Delve which have a super sitting in the middle of the belt, but I'm sure some mechanic could be imagined.  NPCs which target jam the super?  
---
Just spit-balling here.
---
You're missing the point. 
---
In a perfect world (or one players are trying to create), you'd bring caps out to bash a structure and a subcap fleet to escort. The people defending would bring subcaps to fight subcaps, and caps to fight caps. From there, certain sides would escalate on what they'd want to do next.
---
What usually happens is a group brings subcaps to bash, defenders drop caps, subcaps get melted and attackers don't want to escalate because their subcaps are already eating shit. It also doesn't help that 99% of the time the objective isn't even worth the loss of a few supers, both in terms of finances and actual tactical advantage.
---
high sec --&gt;
---
dont think reposting this thread will make me forget that you promised to debate me
---
Also Stealth Bombers don't fit Tank but ewar.
---
You might want to look into how AssFrigs can tank Supercarrier etc. while destroying their fighters.
---
https://youtu.be/cTMwgFlinuA
---
Really fun and if you swap AssFrig Empires you can do that in other space too.
---
Hey I enjoy ramming my head into nullsec XD
---
Forgive me if I can’t a bunch of null f1 monkeys seriously when you say you want “dynamic” gameplay.The majority are just crabbing while you wait for pings instead of finding content on your own.
---
*old grampa voice* "Back in my day we would get a few hundred tristans together and swarm capital ships. Now. . . .now they just use aoe DD's."
---
Even longer ago some dd's would have the ability to shoot nukes all over the field and wipe fleets out. They got rid of those, remodeled DD's for single target. During these days you could get a frigate with as much resistance as fucking possible and literally tank a DD. That was soon gone because OP. So they made DD's stronger. Then came the AOE DD's again. FUCK
---
Agree, I should have invested my isk in plex before I quit for 5 years. Would have made bank.
---
He can't farm horde, so he's farming Karma
---
Shut up if you cant bring 1000 people you just dont deserve to play eve online a spaceship video game
---
&gt; In general, cynos need looking at.
---
My dumb poorly thought out idea for this: Give cynos a short spool up timer where all the effects on the ship are active and the beacon shows up on grid but you can't jump to it yet. This wouldn't hinder most travel/JF jumping since you mostly do that when people aren't around or into range of a friendly citadel anyway. It would make it so the cyno ship is has to be able to survive what's being dropped on for a short time, either because it has an escort/logi or it's big and tanky enough. This makes people either need to actually have some level of subcap control on a field or risk a more expensive ship.
---
Doesn't really solve anything, it just means you have to fly those everywhere you go or you'll still get shit on by caps.
---
The problem isn't that subcaps can't kill caps easily, it's that caps kill subcaps too easily. 
---
The real issue is both fax reps and absolute ehp of caps. While they are somewhat balanced in terms of against other caps they are completely imbalanced against sub caps. A solution to help bring them in line with sub caps is to nerf all cap dps in proportion with ehp. Caps would remain generally in balance with eachother but more vulnerable to sub cap weapons and less damaging to sub caps. Obviously the numbers would take a lot of thought but I personally wouldn't mind cutting dread/super/titan/ dps in 1/2 and dread/super/titan/fax ehp by 1/2 with another small nerf to fax rep amount. 
---
Just cutting fax ehp would also solve a good amount of the problem. 
---
do you want wormhole cap fight videos too or would them dying horribly not fit your narrative 
---
Im pretty sure Vily and progod spent the last 2 years making sure TEST didnt pick a side so we could grow.
---
PLs  shortsightedness completely fucked up that balance though.
---
I enjoy this too. Still get null roams and explore my chains.
---
flair checks out
---
at very least they should show up on the killmail so when you do zkill-fu you can see, take this one for example, that he was a huge bitch.
---
DON'T GIVE HIM IDEAS!!!
---
strongest geometric shape
---
Eh plenty of us were making these posts 2-3 years ago and we were told to shut up and adapt.
---
Just boosh and steal extractors worth 1 plex from rorq pilots.
---
Better than fluorescent yellow, that actually hurts my eyes.
---
I need a video...  please tell me someone recorded it!  
---
The one night I really could have played but decided to sleep for work ya'll get a titan... fuck off. 
---
It's just one of those things that are part of the genuine sandbox experience. Unless CCP said it was against the rules, there will always be opportunistic players that run multiple accounts.
---
Praxis is just a battleship sized Gnosis. 
---
Yeah, they should make carriers the logical escalation vs subcaps, then dreads/supers the logical anti-carrier escalation, then titans/fax, but make each level do little to levels not immediately below them. I think having supers only able to use bomber fighters, and making bomber fighters do jack vs. cruisers down and titans not able to fit HAWs would make more of a Rock Paper Scissors thing with logical progressions up to caps, not just a “lol boson the frigate fleet they can’t do anything”
---
lmao implying I'd ever become a spodbrained goon with 27 rorqs, probably cherrypicking all the good rocks so I can krab up my next super alt
---
Your vids are so good to watch, losses or not
---
How do you intend to nerf friends?
---
I'm not arguing or agreeing with the validity of your argument, I'm just stating that nerfing the social aspect of a social game seems like an uphill battle.
---
No HAWs on Titans too.
---
I didnt
---
&gt;Rock-paper-scissors with structures doesn't work because you can't roam with structures
---
*yet
---
Nerfing a ship in the game wont cure the cowardice that's herding all the players into 3 groups, the two largest of which are aligned. 
---
The fights you're looking for aren't being shit on by capitals anymore than the outright bulk of each side. Every nerd applied to caps gets undone by players bitching.  Remember when I said removing jump fatigue was the worst thing CCP could do? 
---
The issue with this kind of thinking is it assumes that there is no balanced middle ground. Like capitals can be good vs structures, but there can still be a damage cap to prevent them easily blobbing out structures. 
---
People commit the same fallacy when I say mega empires need to expand, citing how fozzie sov was designed so mega alliances do not need to take space from the small guy. There is a difference between a system that forces an entity of 30k accounts in 4 regions, and a system that forces it to 10 regions.
---
Well the maze had a torp that oneshots a battlecruiser unless you had 95+ em resist.  And i remember one having a 30 mil battleship spawn that could tank close to 2k dps.  Either way i wish there were more of a cycle of these ded sites.  Random waves or different stuff.  Or even whole different sites.  Sure they added sleeper stuff, but that doesnt help the rest of the game with 10 year old DED sites.  
---
Nerf the yield of rorwual by 30%. Nerf the explosion velocity and radius of fighter by 30%.
---
Impossible to fit haw on titan but put a new standard weapon on titan that will be better against cap to compensate.
---
Make a delay of 15 sec before able to jump on a cyno.
---
And eve will be great again imo.
---
TIL nano gangs is ganking ratters
---
you aren't...
---
oh dear 
---
Good suggestions but misses a couple of points of capital imbalance. For example Rorq mining yield should be nerfed into like Orca +25 to bring them in line with Porp and Orca. Cynos probably need to be nerfed, too (spool up time?). Also bring back CCP Greyscale and roll fatigue back to it's original levels.
---
Until I stop? I, sir, don't hate myself that much. I only just found out about the problems that came with the glamourex boosters. I had a null hole to venal and watched this very large group (10ish) characters all doing the same thing at the same time and I assume they were turning in/getting missions and were all input broadcasting. 
---
And still are.
---
Probably by the same people who are now agreeing with you since they aren't the TOPDAWG anymore
---
It's a good platform for when I want to listen to something Eve-related on the drive to work. It's a bit propaganda-y sometimes, but still enjoyable. 
---
&gt; 1) remove GTFOs
---
&gt; 2) Remove Sirens ( or at the very least remove their MWD)
---
&gt; 3) Remove all Burst projectors
---
&gt; 4) Ban HAWs from Titans
---
&gt; Bonus) Make Boson Spool up much longer
---
1) okay maybe
---
2) yikes, maybe make their MWD slower
---
3) Nah
---
4) ummmm. no thanks
---
Bonus) I can sort of agree
---
The only thing this does is stop dreadbombs, which isn't even a problem right now.
---
"people should not huddle together for safety they should be forced to spread out so i can prey on them more easily."
---
Your statement makes my point. What if CCP relegated nano kitey ships to the new structure bash. Only ultra fast, low dps ships could get under the guns of structures? But they were good for nothing else? They would RAAAAGE.
---
&gt;No, I just find it very self serving to be able to use them and win a fight down south and be completely ok with the mechanics and not make some reddit post about it.
---
Yes it sucks more to be on the receiving end, we know. Pgl has been complaining about it for a while. It's not just suddenly an issue because it happened to us, he just happened to post about it. He's just more publicly vocal about stuff than most. 
---
&gt;Turn the page to your northern deployment and get the shit kicked out of you, then go bitch to CCP that capitals are unbalanced
---
&gt;
---
&gt;I don’t give a shit that you used them, it was just very interesting to see the liberal usage of them during the PL souther deployment when you guys clearly knew that PL was fighting with one hand behind their backs.
---
You're literally suggesting we can't have an opinion because we once participated in the oppressive side. That's exactly the same thing we did with our northern deployment. 
---
&gt;Next off, don’t empty quote some nonsense conjecture that I never said lmao
---
Ah, sorry you don't know what summary is I guess
---
I think he just misses the simpler times of the Charon/Carbon contract or people just plainly asking for isk to double it. 
---
That is your perfect world. That is not "the" perfect world. In my perfect world there are two fleets of thousands of capitals that fight to the death with no tidi.
---
Sell/fraud minerals, buy compressed ore, reprocess at desto.
---
tbh who even cares about minerals anymore, rorqs mine so much you can probably mine whatever you want where you're going in a short time.
---
But holding a lot of space is harder than holding one region, so this will allow smaller groups to poke the big beast and try to carve off bits of the empire.
---
How can you catch up? Explain it to me please.No matter how much you mine you can't outcrab the chinese and russians in goons like PLA
---
Simple solution that will never happen is make all capital ship bpo into bpc and make them drop from High sec missions or DED sites. Lore wise you can maybe make it so that the bpos are being stolen by a unknown entity and only new bpc can be found if you do a specific mission or something where they drop due to you killing a escort group. This will limit how many capitals are in the game at any given time and make titans, Supers and roques valuable again.
---
Let me rephrase, "a realistic perfect world." Caps aren't ever going to brawl for no reason, especially in today's climate.
---
"Sub should beat cap by attrition, numbers bla bla"
---
Lol yeah
---
lets get a fight with 500 caps and 4000 subs see how that works out
---
A realistic perfect world would mean thousands of capital ships, each with hundreds of anti-sub capital weapons and dozens of small fighter type escorts.
---
1. Plex is more expensive because everyone and there brother have even more alts these days mining and injector farming. They make a ton of money doing those things and are willing to pay more for plex. Higher demand, higher price.
---
2. All that mining and industry means a lot of supply so things are super cheap.
---
3. Praxis is battleship Gnosis. Very pretty. Have you ever looked at the speed of the Nestor by the way because I'm pretty sure that's the slowest subcap.
---
Well those Fighters only travel about 1.1km/s on a Hel, Nyxes are those with better Fighterspeed and tracking but support Fighters still travel at about 1.5km/s.
---
You're not scrambled so overheat your MWD and simply burn away, you might be webbed by Dromis but they're also slow.
---
You can allways defang fighters quite well. And Siren/Dromis got a squadsize of only 3.
---
You need a Fleet to take on a Super and even if you both manage to kill yourselfes those Subcapitals will be ISK positive. If you fight 1v10 kitchensink or something against a Super without proper fleet-setup you will loose.
---
There enough YouTube Videos of BjornBee fighting Capitals, you can defang Carriers rather quickly with a good FC.
---
https://youtu.be/cTMwgFlinuA on how to solo Heavy Fighters 1v1 with an AssFrig.
---
Supercapitals are no Battleship, you can't 1v1 them as easy.
---
the Initiative demonsrated it well how to take on fighters while killing a PanFam Keepstar. Fighter MWD shuts off after 20sec and can't be reactivated for 1min. So INIT kited Fighters in their Battleships around Keepstar grid.
---
Welcome to Red vs.  Blue v2019
---
Sounds like someone is upset.
---
We don't care about bots, macros, or scammers.
---
CCP only bans input broadcasting. So as long as you're not input broadcasting your bots, you're okay!
---
Elo butfucked a load of NC faxes with muninns when we ambushed a load of rorqs. Not even carriers and supers could stop us. 
---
Faxes are not OP, you just need a decent target watcher to blip them away one by one.
---
MY 300 DREADS DIED I BLAME CCP SUPERS TOO STRONK HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MY PLAN
---
&gt; We have gone from being traditional TEST to being the 1st genuine new superpower contender the games seen since the BoB days.
---
Huh? Post-BoB rising superpowers: Goons themselves, the old Northern Coalition, NC., PL...
---
You could do a new MSpaint with a screen shot of e/EVE and post that as the problem with Capitals.
---
It's the rorqs plus injecting that is bad. It just synergizes and has made supers so cheap and attainable for anyone that it has cheapened the experience and proliferated things out of control.
---
They should just make EVE 2 and start from scratch and think long and hard how caps can and should be implemented. 
---
They should start over because they can't take peoples toys away in this game or it will be seen as punishment. 
---
I feel like in some ways eve is irrevocably ruined after injectors showed up. That in combination with endless rorqual mining. 
---
Can we get a change on that light green to something we can read #ccpliss
---
When you scan down a wh and warp to it, right-click and click show info. Look for where it says it leads. You are looking for "unknown space". "Dangerous unknown space" and "deadly unknown space" are C4-C6 wormholes and won't be profitable for an exploration frigate.
---
I have an idea, this will not solve or put a large dent in how things are, but it may be of some help.
---
Make a Triglavian Dread. Make it so that it requires a 3rd material found and extracted only and exclusively from the Abyss, no HAW, XL weapon only with some serious additional tracking penalties so it is capable of hitting caps and structures only. Give it enough spool up DPS so that 3-5 of them can actually punch through tank and kill a super.
---
In addition, give marauders another module, kinda like the bastion but instead of doing what bastion does, let them fit XL weapons instead, again, super low tracking so they can't be used on anything other then caps / structures all the while giving marauders the usability buff that they need.
---
The nerf on caps should be as hard as the nerf on your sence of irony.Basicaly nerfed out of existence. And not everyone is a retard, just 99,9%. Il make a twitch stream about it. You will see, you will see.
---
It was AIDs.
---
And also hilarious.
---
Yea the problem is that none of it is random so you know what you need to bring to cheese it
---
I was thinking more like a marauder but with anti cap guns or something.  Idk.  I'm not a game dev.  
---
Don't have the is problem in wormholes.. Just saying..
---
In what way did I say for test to fight us fairly? We knew you had your super fleet around the corner, we knew that there wasn’t much we could do about it lol
---
So in what part of my statement suggest you do such a thing? That’s not a summation of my beginning post lol learn to read ~~Valkorsia~~ creecher
---
They also make pretty explosions
---
You actually think he wanted it to stay on our forums? Jokes on you then lol. 
---
They'd get squashed as soon as they poked the beast.  If the beast was somehow distracted at that particular moment, it'll stop by soon and supply a squashing.
---
The "little guys" need indifference from the big blocs to grow.  Right now, no big bloc is going to conquer, say, Omist.  Too much of a logistics hassle for what you get in return.  But if Omist has resources and a big Bloc doesn't, then it is no longer too much of a hassle.
---
Hello my dear friend.
---
The amount of people that have/had a succesfull alliance is very small.
---
They sure as shit won't read this thread. What you are doing is asking for advice from a group who has 0 idea on how to run a good alliance.
---
I am sorry for your loss. But as a starting tip: Have 500b startup.
---
Or just put what other games have put, chat / timestamp filter on similar chat messages so that they can spam it only once every 15-20 min. But hey, imagine what that would do to the chat servers ... LOL
---
There are more options with right click. Also it has words instead of pictures. 
---
Only got 10km range so its quite useless tbh.
---
You most likely will refit for it incombat.
---
And dreads are also the only "cheap" option for killing supers
---
-1 too much  symmetry
---
Removing jump fatigue was indeed a horrible decision. One of many they made the last few years.
---
&gt;legit
---
You realize that has no bearing on CCP's decisions, right? This is a game company that encourages illegit.
---
so your willy will fit when you put it in
---
&gt;it's CCP's job to police and nerf human nature and their desire to join together in groups
---
Christ, that's a lot of ads.

Your definition of meaningful and my definition of meaningful can be wildly different based on how we fund our playstyles.
---
If I've got a trillion and you've got a billion, there's no way to make a loss meaningful to both of us.
---
Just added my characters and it didn't crash!
---
I'm pretty excited, its got the best fitting tool for being on the go.
---
The best way to kill a work meeting is going to EFT hell. 
---
It's ok, I adapted last year by unsubbing.
---
For my first several months, most of what I read was indistinguishable from the average Triglavian writing.
---
Its a space ship parking lot, those are just the parking spaces down that hole.
---
I figured it was AFK or repped late, but seeing 2 nanite in the ancil convinced me it's real. Tell the guy it's a great kill
---
Oh my, has it already been 5 years? Tfw a game makes me feel old.
---
Not sure if that would be the best solution for the little predicament we all face in EVE at the moment... Although one thing is undeniable, something needs to be done about it, it's uterly ridiculous how you can be hot droped by a super when you are ratting in a T1 CRUISER...
---
Honestly, I do not know a way that would be "Fair" to deal with this situation... It's either a "BAN HAMMER" situation or "Band-aid" fix.
---
Make all capital bpo into bpc only with ccp have a low drop rate. Make capitals worth having and a little more spevial to kill and to own
---
I would come back to a eve 2. 
---
I'm done with eve after the injectors and rorquals it ruined most of the "danger" eve represented. The joke of "already replaced" is more real then ever now. 
---
If they reset and made a new eve they would have to think hard on how they would re-implement capitals so they dont run into similar issues. 
---
Except, we didnt rage back in the day, thete was a natural escalation.
---
Well, you go mine ore, and with that ore, you build shit.  It's pretty easy.
---
Alternatively, you can sell the ore and buy shit.
---
If you don't understand that everyone reaches a point of diminishing returns eventually; that you can only load so many ships on a grid, you can only multibox so many characters, well, I don't know what to tell you. Keep playing PUBG.
---
Snuff says hi!
---
Eve players have raged forever...
---
&gt;All of you have opinions, 99.9% of them are wrong
---
Pulling statistics out of your arse is not a good way to get people to listen to you. 100% of people agree. 
---
We had that earlier in Eve's history.  Alpha was so high that there was no point in logi, because they'd be dead before you could even click on them to start targeting.
---
It was not an improvement over the current game.
---
Don't think scam is the issue here.
---
But the all day round presence.
---
I wouldn't recommend AFK ratting in a Super Carrier.
---
I like reps. I was just respond with how useful an all or nothing response is. Plus, now I wont get reps in fleet and get insurance pay outs.
---
You my friend ought to go through some military training other then boot camp, someplace that starts with the "Art of War", or at least has it as part of the curriculum. You will then understand how nonsensical your way of thinking is and how many battles / wars have been lost exactly and precisely due to commanders / leaders who thought like that and followed those thoughts IRL.
---
Fancy apartment. 3,150 rent. Utilities not included. Has view of real starship underbellies.
---
You should ask your mom. I'm sure she knows.
---
Disposal chute for people who run on low graphics.
---
Just kidding...
---
That's valet only parking. 
---
I have 2 titans and 2 supers, I'm willing for them to go right in the trash with no buyback or reprocessing/etc. It's true that PL has abused supers, as have Goons, TAPI and pretty much everyone in existence at this point. It's not a fun meta, surely we can agree on that?
---
Ratting and selling the escalations that I don't feel like running to corp mates.
---
So if I buy a full-fit carrier with a month's worth of PLEX I can plex myself with 30 ticks(or 10 hours) a month and spend all the rest of my in-game income throwing cheap subcaps on pvp to have fun. That's good to know.
---
Querns V/S PGL .

Money 1.5x promised if your side wins.
---
Taking 100mil bets.
---
Send ISK to "Karan Arjun" with a comment made as "Querns/PGL".
---
Payouts after 30days sharp. 
---
(People probably will get bored in a week though so expect isk  earlier!)
---
That's true but that's why you have strength in numbers.
---
No one is suggesting that, but if you can't bring 1000 people, you shouldn't be able to fight someone who can without putting in some effort to isolate smaller chunks of the group.
---
That is perfectly fine, but the game design should not reward it to the extent it currently does.
---
Problem there is dreads are cheaper and would be better for almost every situation.
---
Best thing i could thing of on short notice would be give blops cap guns, similar to the fact that cov ops frigates get torps.
---
* It would make them actually viable in the meta instead of just bridges
---
* They are expensive as fuck compared dreads (cause T-2 insurance)
---
It was mostly AIDs because of crimewatch. It made each of you guys vanish one by one because it had to do some stupid crimewatch mechanic interaction between each person and the titan pilot.
---
I haven't played the game in years but have lurked here enough to understand completely, and that worries me.
---
naw just buff dreads, then more caps will die more often
---
No poors 
---
Am I supposed to care who this is?
---
I click on the icon.
---
cruisers can absolutely destroy most dreads and all carriers, and can wear down supers and titans if they have enough time. Without fax support, at least. The problem is that caps destroy subcaps too well, and subcaps can't even touch anything with boosted local or remote cap reps (faxes &amp; rorquals)
---
A clicker.. is worse than a button pusher!
---
It was "how can ANY OTHER subcap" my bad lol
---
And I realized I forgot the Nestor anyway, that billion-isk mobile depot/hanger of the wormhole.
---
wouldn't this make the n+1 meta even stronger? 
---
This isnt a before and after buddy, read again.
---
I expect you to have plenty of footage of your own alliance, right?
---
I feel like you can make more money just working in reality and subscribing. It's illegal to pay less than like $8/hour so surely you can find something paying slightly above $1/hr full time. 
---
replaced? no... mabye by shit groups...
---
Leshs got added to brawls which is a nice thing. more diversity, good dps against caps.
---
dreks are awesome too.. but only for ganks.. not for big armor brawls. 
---
Yeah. They should be about helping a new player train up a bit faster. You shouldn't be able to inject into a capital ship on day 1. And that's without even considering the RMT and botting implications.
---
He's so fucking annoying.
---
Nah, having huge wars that cost capitals no longer works due to the rate mining / isk generation / cap replacement. Just look at the last war. The north has some less caps but is catching up at an astonishing rate and some of the alliances are even growing more and faster in caps then they did before.
---
All the while Gooest ( I invented a new word for Goons + Test ) have replaced all their losses and are plowing on ahead again stockpiling even faster and even more.
---
So you have to come up with something else.
---
Talk about it, I said so since I smell a strong POS siege nostalgia from the post
---
ISK has lost its value. Hence why it takes more to PLEX and less to buy items. When CCP decided a monthly subscription cash flow wasn't gonna cut it and allowed people to inject into rorqs overnight with six orca toons while skill farming it's gonna throw shit out of whack. Supposedly they have an economist on staff. He sleeps on the job. 
---
this game isnt as complicated as nerds make it out to be
---
Yeah let's just make subcaps useless for bashing structures in the only kind of space where you actually get loot from them, and instead make you have to build caps in system.
---
OP has never played in Jspace 
---
Don't like to scan exits and roll holes .....
---
Yea but hasn't that alpha been super nerfed since then ?
---
Extremely balanced ... subcap ships can point out to maybe 50km, capital ships can point out to 1000km
---
More like, common everyday practice in the real world and Eve-world alike. 
---
Couldn't agree more. Dare I say it, but take a look at WoW, they release patch notes and refinements to systems every 2 weeks, sometimes weekly. CCP do a big update and then leave things unchanged for months. There needs to be more active iterative development.
---
Get a Scrum Master in!
---
Here's a chart of how many fucks I give.
---
0
---
My only problem with this is that it would make gatecamping basically riskless. I agree with not dropping caps automatically on gapecamps, but the only way to kill, rather than break up a gatecamp is to bridge in on it. If you try to bring a cruiser gang to a cruiser camp, they'll starburst out if they see even parity forces, so cyno bait is the best way to trap them. Spool up cyno for cap jumps, sure, but not for bridging. 
---
I can get behind either corporation skins that show the corp logo where the respected faction logo would be. Or even alliance skins
---
Really, I recognize that SKINs are an isk sink mostly for those that can throw isk around for fun. I wanted to have something nice like the Yoiul YC121 SKIN for a Strat, for example, that didn't cost me half a month of game time, for my casual play. Clearly, I'm just a butthurt filthy casual (this is true) that doesn't play enough or have the right friends to get into larger groups where isk printing Level 5 can be easily trained.
---
/jihad
---
FAXes definitely are a problem. A couple of FAX on field (or even one, for a small gang) negates an entire enemy fleet, but, unlike subcap logi, you also can't kill, neut or boosh off the logi ship, so it just completely denies a fight.
---
Rorqs are a problem too, no argument there.
---
You must be a nightmare at parties.
---
Can't really fight super umbrellas with anything less than a super umbrella.   
---
Why would anyone deploy their super umbrella?   
---
Then why would we bother fighting for SOV?   
---
Why would we form hundreds of subcaps?   
---
PGL has done everything in his power to provide content in the north without much use of supers.   
---
Result = Not possible.  
---
Game is broken man. 
---
What's that
---
Maybe Fix your spy problem before armcharing gamebalance passes 
---
That seems reasonable. If the goal is to make it so a cap fleet can't appear out of nowhere and subs are used more often your idea supports that.
---
I agree. I would actually reactivate / re-sub my BLOPS account if BLOPS was useful in the larger scheme of things. Right now its kinda pathetic, all you can do with it is just kill some excavators here and there which get insta replaced and an occasional rare super dumb fuck or AFKer or bot.
---
4D Chess, just like Trump. amirite?
---
ayyyyyyy!
---
pretty sure that was only against notorious stream cheaters, not that I'd be surprised if Destiny (and especially his fans) hit other people with it again
---
fucking deezer and combatex and the angry low masters league wannabes they spawned 
---
What ships have a big enough cargo hold to carry and anchor XL structures? I was looking at the freighters, but it doesn't seem like even with freighter V that they would have enough space.
---
At this point. It's a paradise for low technical skills shit tier nerd   players. Force fed endless content via the blobbing on structures meta
---
Reposting **MY** manifesto from the previous thread:

Maximum cta posting
---
There's a thread already for this 😑
---
&gt; if you want something to change, you gotta start at home
---
But his claim is that the capital-rorqual-blob meta is OP and ruining the game. If something is OP then you'd be silly not to use it in your home space.

To show how OP carriers are, here's a clip of me one-shotting Zarvox in an assault cruiser.

(not supposed to be taken seriously but if it's used in PGL's narrative hey why not?)
---
&gt;Nerfing a ship in the game won't cure the cowardice that's herding all the players into 3 groups
---
I think the biggest issue is *why* fights happen.  Spending almost a month to kill a structure that can be deployed in 24 hours in any amount is a big problem in my eyes, and considering that most of the bigger citadel deployment fights usually have a dozen citadels in strategic positions around them only shows this further.
---
Suggestion: Remove the reinforcement layers and move these to a fuel-driven module. Make it *cost* to maintain a citadel, and not something you can just spam everywhere.  It's like with POS towers; you got one reinforce that you could manipulate the time of through a resource installed in it, and there was a fucking *limit* on POS's too.
---
He should use some cooked in The Last Dab redux.  That shit is HOTTT
---
Right click, block.    
---
Fixed.
---
Well, the ability to "mask" cyno fields wth HIC bubbles or something might be nice, too. Script the HICs with a new script that puts its range at ~50km but instead of disabling warps, it only disables new jumps to existing cynos.  Don't even have to make the cyno disappear or inhibit new ones going up, just stop people jumping to them if you're sitting in range with the scripted HIC.
---
I feel like if you have to ask this question then you shouldn't drop w.e structure your thinking about dropping.
---
i like you man
---
Introduce a 3rd material type into Abyss that drops only in tier 4 and 5 and make it a requirement for cap building. It would solve a lot of issues, really, seriously. GFL trying to bot or AFK through a level 5 abyss site, and that's just for starters. 
---
You share scanning duties as a corporate and have things like exits and sites on Corp bookmarks. Not that hard really.
---
I think POS warfare works now with the fax system.  It's actually one of the successful parts about faxes, they got rid of the massed spider tanking.
---
That's gana be quite impossible at this point. Besides you buy most cap bpos from NPCs in hs. There is no drop rate to Nerf.
---
I also support a spool-up time for cynos. I'm not totally on board with exempting subcap bridges from that - bridging a bunch of stuff onto a small gang roam kills content nearly as effectively as dropping caps on it - but it's not an outrageous suggestion.
---
They will soonTM. 
---
Reinstate fatigue on jump gates. Friends may be friends, but they'll stop showing up if its 40+ *real* jumps to join a fight every day.
---
Maybe near Lunar New Year and Valentine's Day
---
Just my personal speculation
---
Much complicate, very EvE. 
---
Actually you can at least to some extent. Just like law enforcement recovers and returns stolen / illgotten goods, follow botted minerals / isk in the game and just do it. Remove the ones that were build using those, you'll be surprised just how huge of a chunk it will be and how much difference it will make in the game as a whole.
---
cargo-expanded freighters hold over 1M m3, an XL structure takes up 800k AFAIK
---
you can run a sanctum in vni?
---
We don't talk about Cloud Ring...
---
i dip my rokh in an out
---
But why the wyvern?
---
All of these changes would make having subcap control of the grid a necessity to effectively use capitals. In my mind, that's how Eve should function. I just genuinely don't know if that's the intended vision ccp has in mind for capitals, or if there's a vision at all
---
I'm fine with that, just give me something to use with my Amarr BS V that isn't just soccer moming the kids to covert cynos or too stupidly expensive to be worth using (Paladin)
---
member when jump fatigue was the worst decision ccp has ever made 
---
This
---
o7 you will be missed, sir.
---
Well, to this people will rightfully say WoW operates on a different scale economy. That they have the manpower. Which is why I cited CCP's financial decisions.
---
Yet I believe CCP can do this on a smaller, targeted scale. Like have a dedicated team to make small changes in three areas below and you'll solve 90% of Eve's most important problems:
---
- Ship balance: Issues pertaining to balance between structures, capitals and supcaps.
---
- Ecosystem balance: Issues pertaining to how people make money, and how pvp interactions occur.
---
- Sov Warfare: Issues pertaining to how people capture and maintain sov nullsec.
---
The alliance tourny teams each field one flagship that is blinged to the max.
---
It's a sandbox game and player decisions shape the game, sure. But, not all strategies and tools are equal, which means that the game itself suggests ways to play. You have to take that into consideration to find out how we got here. 
---
I'll debate you! I have no idea what we are debating or what my or your stance is, but hey, I can wing it.
---
Not if deploying stuff to squash people is more effort or expense than it's worth.
---
And another sale on skins
---
Ah...
---
fly safe DhSJ fam
---
so nerf cap/super damage to subcaps.  Make their application to anything smaller than another cap so worthless it's like a SB trying to torp another frigate.  Sure it can be done, but that SB will die long before the other frigate does. 
---
Is this post vote-brigaded as well?
---
Yea, all those kinds of modules should operate more like ADCs then the way they do now.
---
Yeah. Less time mining, more time finding lucrative asteroids. 
---
It's not about length it's about girth 😐
---
It takes time , when I started the game I was lost , but the more you play and more involved you start understanding the context. Be patience there is no skill injector for it. 
---
Trust me, I know. I was just curious about larger structures.
---
Oh I assumed you were there doing it
---
I guess if hating yourself means hating one of the eziest isk making methods in the game, sure? I hate myself?
---
Lmao got deleted by Goon biased shit tier mods, hahahaha
---
/u/jibrish god bless you
---
I mouse click. Rebound all my F keys to otehr stuff.
---
Bot is already working then.
---
EVE is complicated mainly due to the PvP nature of the game. Things get deep when players dig for an advantage. 
---
There's also a VAST array of slang used. If you don't understand something, ask. Most folks here will drop the usual salt-mining/propaganda attitude if we can tell you're a legit new-player needing help. 
---
Why do nubs get treated like this 😢 
---
death
---
1. Common, achievable goal.
---
2. Everyone does a little something, nobody does everything.
---
3. Some people know more, some people are learning.
---
4. Play together and try to have fun at everything.
---
When you trash stuff it has to go somewhere.
---
because
---
1 - I'm an elitist asshole.
---
2 - I don't have to be a decent human being in matters concerning a game.
---
3 - YOU made it Imperium related. YOU should understand that some characters have a distaste for certain game related entities. 
---
Always have a succession plan, the organization should not be dependent on key people. I  is risiculous that 1000 toon group disband because one person leaves due to reason. Be honest about the plans from an organizational point of view. And have fun 
---
I was going to comment about the Nestor, but you beat me to it.  Poor thing.  Only reason I don't use it more.
---
Jams, damps, etc. Anything to break the spool up of the vedmak or if breaking the tank is the issue then the curse seems like a good option. Maybe a neuting armor stratios with damps?
---
&gt;Apparently you're the guy that drops caps on a single frigs because you cant figure anything else out. That's cool I guess, have fun with it.
---
Ad Hominems are a nice way to argue when no arguments are available, not. 
---
Why not make the jump drive at ship level spool rather than cyno and make it mass based so smaller ships jumping through a bridge is quick and therefore titans take longer to jump than carriers. 
---
Although it would make moving rather difficult!
---
EVE Universe - ~~Terrorists~~ Dirty Minmatars in Amarr Space
---
The reason the only roaming gangs are nano is because anything brawly gets capitals dropped on it, though. So even those people should support nerfing capital projection.
---
Everything you suggested would just benefit the largest groups. If a smaller group can only mine 1 mineral per minute, but goons can mine 100 minerals per minute (work with me here), who is going to clear more sites per 24 hours if, say, the cooldown on site respawn time is 2 hrs? Goons obviously.
---
Same with nomadic play. Who would be able to move to a new region and grind all the adms/structures? The biggest alliances would. More bodies = more people to throw at cancerous fozzie sov and citadel grinding.
---
CCP really need a year of Crucible type releases. Fix shit and make iterations. We'd have plenty of content if half of it was viable. 
---
CCP couldnt find him.
---
And we now know they are not the same. Still have to grow the traded toons the old fashion way.
---
Makes sense? Hell, that almost perfectly describes my game time last night!   Well, except they never got a single excav and then they safe-logged like the bads they are.
---
You can make bunch of ISKies for your Toonies while scanning in Guristas Space since it has the best relic sites.
---
Salvaging after Titans, Carriers and Supers in bigger Alliances also makes you about 120mil/h with boni for Dread- or Factionspawns.
---
You don't need Capitals to make money.
---
Aquire knowledge.
---
As long as they can only hit each other and leave rest of the game entirely unaffected, I'd be OK with that.
---
Exactly. Got to get them hooked on the game before you start shittalking them! :)
---
Nah, I gave perfectly valid alternate responses that don't rely on placing a fleet ontop of his NPC backup, but apparently "just drop caps" is your acceptable answer. And that's cool I guess, go for it.
---
It's time for EVE 2. 
---
I love the Nestor but it's definitely a weird one. Slow as anything, but with crazy agility for a BS and a faster warp speed than any BS other than the Mach. It's just an interesting all-rounder, it can do logi, neuts, and DPS well enough all at the same time but doesn't do any single one of those rolls exceptionally.
---
I heard the last dab is around 2 million scoville 
---
Damage caps are the wrong way to look at the issue.
---
Damage caps force a minimum engagement time, but the spam of citadels made damage caps an annoyance. Previously stations were insanely expensive, now anyone with a few hours of grinding isk or a credit card can build(spam) citadels everywhere.
---
CCP's mistake was not capping the number of citadels per grid/system. 
---
WOA Fighting is great in hockey.
---
Personally I'd quite like to see them implement a scheme similar to Warframe whereby people can create and submit content, in this case skins. They could be voted on and then approved and added to the game, would be interesting to see what people come up with.
---
I like to click and hit keys. Kind of a combination.
---
I agree. Subcaps should only be able to shoot other subcaps.
---
You're making yourself look more and more retarded with every post
---
Please stop
---
You're right, I'm just not even thinking about the possibility given CCP's track record of not giving a shit.
---
Underrated comment. This would be pretty interesting but I'm sure it's garbage for some reason I can't think of
---
Well my kiting tristan has a nano fitted, would be nice.
---
rorqs untouchable by subs? lmao
---
I was hesitant about joining Goons and then the Mittani himself descended from Heaven in his wizard hat, at fanfest, and broke up the spod. He handed the spod to each of us directly in our brains and it was good. I was once a virgin solo PvP pilot and now I am a chad Bosonic boi who has mastered the art of Theta comms. Soon my thirty-third Rorqual pilot will be born from His wisdom crystallized into my soul and my family of Excavator drone pilots will become a clan strong enough to challenge even the toughest of cloaky campers. My botting neighbor has taught me elite strats like how to kill entire fleets by lighting a brilliant constellations of cynos in a single tick. My bosons are ready to deliver Mittani's grace as I shed a single tear of joy.
---
No it isn't. The soft requirements for additional alts / accounts is a sign of "super" shitty design and failure to give things any forethought on part of the devs as well as the current effects of the spiral where the game has less and less active new players while at the same time increasing the number of multiboxers and bots.
---
Incidentally, to me, botlike multiboxers and bots and AFKers and all that sort of utter and complete shit is all the same. Go ahead, change my mind.
---
Wait is this actually him
---
tbh  EVE 1 became so shit I wouldn't even sign up for a BETA of an EVE 2. Can't trust the developer...and look at their publisher. Hard to say id ever have faith in a CCP product again these days.
---
Did the moderators take down your last one? 
---
Fucking bizarre how they choose to moderate(or not) this sub. 
---
They will sooner take down a post that's actually related to the game and encourages discussion about the actual game, and leave up a garbage unrelated shitpost...... 
---
Then again what should I expect, this is the EVE sub, games going down the drain and it's community is leading the way. CCP gave up on it a long time ago, that should be clear to people but some are clearly still in denial.
---
It's still incredibly useful it's an in field compression platform with the best possible boosts and defensive capabilities.
---
Remove the mining aspect and the cost of the ship and potential fit wouldn't even be bad. They should be used for large or medium mining fleets. Instead people just spam them on every rock possible.

I'm very much on board the "fuck caps" train, but I don't really think Sirens are a problem at the moment - yes, they're annoying, but they're also reasonably easy to kill even in a kitchen-sink roaming gang. If I were going to pick a fighter type to nerf into oblivion, it'd be LR heavy fighters - they were supposedly introduced to give supers a way to kill POS, which is fine, but if that's their purpose there's no good reason for them to apply anything like as well as they do to subcaps. They're far more of a problem in terms of subcap vs cap balance than sirens are.
---
Yes citadel's suck in almost every possible way
---
Marauders aren't supposed to be used for pvp, that's the whole point.
---
&gt; I believe cheaper Marauders are the bridge we need to increase sub-cap mass pvp viability! 
---
Why?
---
&gt; how much complicate can be a game?
---
Very.
---
It's a game that started out [famously complicated](https://imgur.com/gallery/jj16ThL) from day one and has only gotten more complicated as CCP has added new features with new mechanics with their own complications over the course of 16 years. On top of all the complications of the game itself there's also 16 years of a tens of thousands of nerdy obsessive players coming up with their own slang and jargon referring to all those game mechanics, the tactics they've come up with to use and abuse them along with all the player driven politics, economics, strategies etc.
---
I've been playing off and on for seven years and half the time I don't understand what people are talking about in this sub.
---
Fortunately you don't need to understand much of all that to enjoy the game. A lot of the fun of it is that there's always knew things to figure out. There's a lot of specialization so you can not only enjoy but even be among the best in the game at the particular thing you enjoy without understanding hardly anything about all those other aspects of the game.
---
You keep repeating the same thing without actually thinking.No matter how much we mine, we can't mine more then goons.Look at the MER.Keep telling yourself that we could keep up if we would try but in reality the rorqual and injector meta is unbeatable right now
---
&gt;I started reading this sub when I resubbed to Eve, but I never played seriuosly before. usually when I start playing a game and start reading the forums it takes me a week or two to understand what people are discussing.
---
&gt;Not here. Noooooooo. Let me give you an idea of what this subreddit sounds like for me.
---
&gt;"ABBREVIATION got reckd in ABBREVIATION by ABBREVIATION with ABBREVIATIONs, rofl cryptic eve meme"
---
&gt;and then you decipher this shit and use wikis and when you're finally close to understanding what this guy is trying to tell you you read a reply and it's all like "lol nice shitposting" and you can start from scratch.
---
&gt;then you read the next post. it's a screenshot. of fucking nothing. there is nothing noteworthy going on in this screenshot of eve online, it's like someone hit the key by accident. everyone in the comments goes crazy over something BUT NOBODY FUCKING EXPLAINS IT. i feel like these screenshots are being posted purely to troll outsiders sometimes.
---
&gt;every comment ever on this sub is some meta4 reference, shitpost, or straight up propaganda and after weeks of reading about eve i still don't understand half of what's going on here. and i love it. don't ever change.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/3cq0e9/this_subreddit_is_special/

As a Cap pilot (I have a Super Carrier no Titan) I have to agree Suppers/Titans are to powerful. When a fight is on I ALWAYS join the sub cap fleet. It's just more fun. Warping in and out of a fight. Trying to get a tactical advantage. That's what I find "fun". Sitting in one spot bubbled up watching fighters inch across the screen in 10% TiDi just sucks imo. Or watching the timer pass waiting to boson again. That's as much fun as sitting on jita undock in a tornado for a hour waiting for some defenseless nerd to undock a T1 hauler. 
---
Supers have there place in the game. But ATM everyone uses them as a win ticket. 'Whoever drops the most Titans win.' 
---
Is that how you really want to play this game? 
---
It just takes a while, dont you worry. Soon youll be shitposting in cryptic space lingo too!
---
Wow, thank you. Message sent!
---
&gt; CCP do a big update and then leave things unchanged for months.
---
Playing devil's advocate, EVE moves more slowly than does WoW. It can take months for groups to change the meta, and years for sovholding empires on the wrong model to erode to dust. I don't think we give CCP nearly enough data for some balancing to take place expeditiously.
---
Other bits of balance, like the hamfisted and stupid Triglavian ships, are totally and rightly laid at the drooling, slack-jawed CCP Rise's feet.
---
Please link the fit with pictures that demonstrates this fit.  
---
RIP dedicated balance team, we never even knew you.
---
To get rid of your local space emperor. Military experts are calling this a "Vader-hole".
---
https://i.4pcdn.org/tv/1513986794726.gif
---
Many people are suggesting this. It's a viable solution. Not saying it isn't. Just saying "more ships" doesn't fix existing problems.
---
Rats already target excavators first over 60% of the time. They choose a new random target when thier current target disappears.
---
Bombers is a bit much, a guy who doesn't own a rorq sitting next(using its compression) to one in a barge or exhumer is dead just because he doesn't want to fly a skiff, can't afford one, or can't fly one yet. 
---
The response fleets don't work so well either for similar reasons. Also, if there are three rep ships in the fleet, it will take an entire fleet or two supers to kill them. They don't give bounty and loot is shit so no one is going to come kill them. 
---
The only reasons those don't work is because of the inconvienceing of the guys that don't mine or are new. 
---
Then it will never change
---
Marauders are also not used for ratting, because they are so expensive and a Rattlesnake is better.
---
Yes, they may be used very effectively for PvE, but why not allow them to be defensive tools for PvP by allowing a cheaper price-point?
---
This is wrong. Balancing against structures is bullshit.
---
It should be subs &lt;carriers &lt; dreads &lt; subs/supers 
---
Subs as a baseline. then carriers are called to counter subs. Dreads are called to counter carriers, but are weak against subs.
---
Supers should be able to fight all caps (not counter) but weak against subs. 
---
Thats how I remember it used to be. Sub on Sub fight, drop the carriers to melt the subs, drop a dread bomb to melt the carriers, drop supers to kinda melt the dreads. get more subs to clear the field and counter the supers (who shouldnt be able to be effective)
---
You're lucky. The one I was in back in the day started to bot and on top of that wanted me to do it with them. So I left it only to get into one with even more botting, and then again and again, after about 6 months of vagabonding through botting alliances I decided to compeltely quit Null Sec. Not that there aren't bots in otehr regions, there are a lot, but they do not affect me anywhere to the degree that nullsec bots did in nullsec.
---
Exactly, its just so asinine to even suggest things to break up groups. It'll never have that effect. The entire reason why I even play this game is because my fellow goons are fun to hang out with on mumble, goonfleet forum, jabber and in-game. The game in itself, sucks a bit. The **players** are great fun. 
---
We smart eh? While at it, I can sell you a C so you look right. :P 
---
The only difference then is the compression. That's not worth that much to me. A good orca already has everything else. And only 1% difference in boosting.
---
Those are not the problems, rorqs, botting, anom concentration, and war decs are the problem.  
---
Another question I always had was why people that complain about any size capital don't ever mention cyno mechanics. They've been mostly the same as long as I've played. Change them to force escalation from subcaps, to caps, to supers.
---
Marauders most certainly ARE used in PvP...

Dirty blobbers.
---
Are you posting a battle report for an alliance you aren't even in?  lol.
---
"Hey PGL this is how you play the game, not that I would know because I surely can't do it"
---
Massive subcap numbers can and have been countered, if you take the legacy feed vs skillu as a recent example, skillu held the field against 2:1 odds with just better piloting. Subcaps allow for skillful counterplay in ways capitals just don't. 
---
If they buff bomber wings (by nerfing defender launchers) as a nerf to n+1 groups like skill and NC will be able to crush even larger fleets that face them down through better positioning and piloting. 
---
So no, not really. This will be a boon for higher skilled, smaller groups.
---
&gt; all the NSA does is give you a 500% scan resboost
---
Which is OP as fuck.
---
The stated intention for NSA is to allow you to lock up and counter fighters. Even allowing for that being a good idea (shouldn't you maybe have some support ships to deal with small stuff), the NSA should only apply to locking fighters in that case.
---
An NSA capital can lock things faster than most subcaps. In order to improve scan res, subcaps need to sacrifice utility or tank to fit sebos, and can get nowhere near +500%. For a single high slot capital ships get far more than you can fit on a subcap.
---
It's retarded tbh
---
Cuz all the fucking scanning, gives you carpal syndrome, literally, like for real IRL.
---
No, I'm saying that over a certain point, it's just Isk in a wallet.
---
Heresy! All hail our lord and savior Spod
---
Well.. sometimes in tidi I don't trust them keys.. ya dig? Also, I made the name for Everquest when I was 18 or something. Thought I was smart then.. now I have to stick with it. Before the Internet could give instant enlightenment.
---
Oooof He is so right tho not gonna lie..... take that L OP
---
its like 10 to 15 ads on an 8 hour video.
---
and i got medical bills so i put ads. i admit it looks like alot but some one divide the 8 hours by ads to get an average time to check it please
---
Living vicariously through other alliances is the new PL meta
---
It moves a LOT faster now thanks to skill injectors though.
---
sirens are so op
---
The dreadbomb was discovered over an hour ago on a stream and seemed to have been ignored, the whelp was deserved.
---
They aren't a bil anymore, closer to 400mil at the moment. People store them in supers and rorqs then eject them to use as no anchor timer depots.
---
No, we showed up to Allies shit 40 jumps or not.  Jump gates are just QOL.
---
In fact, that's the dumbest of all the dumb shit I've read all day.  By your logic the "problem" with allies is as new as jump gates.
---
That one sabre who dishonoured the skillu killboard *tut* 
---
Should be purged
---
Damn 3 minutes away of dropping the eso blob
---
that boson helped skillu pretty much though, but i agree
---
Strong agree. Capitals aren't totally braindead, we really out-thought NC/PL in X47 but there is a lot less counterplay with caps than there are with subs. 
---
"Man, bashing Ihubs and Stations is hella boring and really shitty feeling.  Also it's crashing the nodes on big fights."
---
"Let's make it into a minigame for frigates across three nodes."
---
"Swell idea! That'll reduce server stress and make it feel more enjoyable."
---
Then we go back to single structure bashes that take even *longer* to kill.
---
A better vertical ship than the Nag.
---
Jesus christ the replies to this comment. "Waaah, I want to be able to blue all of space and batphone all of eve all the time, content drivers and hunters are evil". You, and the guy at the top with the reasonable capital nerfs have it perfectly. This shit would revitalize eve.
---
create reasons to attack your friends
---
I love it when "bigger" streamers talk out of their ass and pretend they achieved big things in EvE, understand the game or were "elite solo pilots" but when you keep listening it´s pretty clear they have no idea. 
---
tl:dr: Destiny is "hold back", should I watch that clip? 
---
Stop using kite-y shit and switch to brawlers. Unless you're not pro enough.
---
They're pretty much mission boats, though the rattle really outclasses them anywhere you put it. Goofing around in pyfa the other day and I can't come up with a normal fit that comes anywhere close to maxing out its cpu and powergrid. 
---
I stopped playing 2 and a half years ago after playing for about 10 years. I saw how injectors cheapened the experience. The severe losses people incurred is over. EVE has basically become a theme park mmo like others now. Most losses are more of a nuisance. 
---
Thank you, OP, for choosing the most unappealing color to use for text on on a white background god dammit
---
FC told - only carriers jump, some supers go in as well. Muninn fleet and a dreadbomb follows. 6 supers dies, rip... That's what you get when you are trigger happy and jump in at the first opportunity.
---
0w0 notices depth 
---
Did all the dreads extract cleanly?
---
&gt; Max range is 45km and 536 dps (heated) w/ 2 heat sinks, at max ramp.
---
That's still far more (particularly with the tracking) than you can get from any other destroyer though.
---
When MS paint obviously gives you too many  color choices other than black or white.
---
1 fking fax in 2019 I see nothing wrong with this.
---
Jesus people are quick to post on r/Eve. This is literally still going on as I type. It's a fascinating fight from start to now. I can't wait to see an actual SkillU battle report after this because I am impressed.
---
I like this idea.
---
Most of the skill urself fights end up with feeding truckloads of sabres but nothing else. He's just keeping up with traditions.

I don't think thousands of players without tidi is unrealistic. I work for a company that handles big data requests from credit scoring agencies. Concurrent client requests can be as high as 10,000 across the load balanced cluster of 103 servers.

I think CCP's problems are 2-fold: 1. not large enough financially for the infrastructure needed to support such a scale 2. clients are poorly optimized.
---
Chat bots
---
Market bots
---
Mining bots
---
Ratting bots
---
Mission bots

And much much more. CCP plz.

Yeah because a bunch of krabbing supers that are[T2 fit](https://zkillboard.com/kill/74870280/) and [have no cyno with an empty highslot](https://zkillboard.com/kill/74870214/) and drop without fax support
---
are totally comparable to full, properly fit with a non retarded FC super fleet with, you know, faxes.

This was a gank not an actual battle

They always go on sale a day or two after I resub.  So look for something around the 15th because that is after my main will have paid full for the month.
---
My carrier was already dead 
---
&gt;  comps of sleipnirs
---
Kek. What is this? 2016?
---
&gt;itan/super/carrier blob on them in home space while they have a rorq tackled might not be a fleet ender for the whalers in this case
---
Except it would because he's not suggesting any nerfs to light fighters or lr fibos, only to their ability to tackle things. All this does is make it easier for hunters to run away, which they are already good at if you're not brain dead.
---
Careful, CCP Fozzie will ban you if you talk shit. Just look at Stunt Flores, it wasn't even him and he got banned.
---
The fight was already over at that point, they got got on the outgate (though they did try mid fight), it just murdered the fleet going home, and had no baring on the objective.
---
The tracking is the problem for me, although the DPS on the kiki is also arguably too high. But the tradeoff in every other weapon system, apart from missiles, that can project to range is that you can get close and out-track them. (For missiles, the tradeoff is that the ranged missiles have low damage so a brawl ship can get close and win the DPS race - not relevant to triglavian weapons.) But Triglavian weapons track as well as the short range hybrids/projectiles/lasers!
---
Give those things a massive tracking nerf so they're comparable to railguns and they'll be mostly balanced overnight. The DPS will still need looking at, potentially.
---
Then, if that makes them impossible to use in brawling scenarios, add the second close range disintegrator variant with higher tracking but lower range (like the beam/pulse lasers).
---
tfw when you have zkill notifications on and see skillu doing gods work
---
DHSJ doing their thing again. Maybe ill have to resub.
---
I don't think he's missed the mark on some of his suggestions, but this line of thinking is retarded, and the people advocating it know it's retarded. TAPI and every other alliance are at the mercy of the current mechanics.  Nobody is going to (nor should they) Eat shit and die in game just to look principled on Reddit to make a point. We should all be playing to win. Right now the issue is that neither winning or losing is looking all that fun
---
Some fangirls gave him a high SP character (this was before injectors) and lots of isk.  He started way ahead of a real newbie and still was bad.
---
Damavik and Vedmaks need a buff. Seriously. Rest of them is fine.
---
In light of how sub-par sub caps are vs caps + current performance of drone / missle ships, DPS wise, I would say the Trig ships are fine, or even underpowered. 
---
Has it occured to you that it just may be not that drone, missile or Trig ships that are OP but that the rest suck ass ? Abyss is a good example of which ship types suck and need more love. Take a good look at it.
---
Again. If you let your 200+ man fleet get bombed to shit by 60 bombers as only hostiles, you're shit at this game and have no right to complain about balance.
---
It feels very weird for me to say this, but I'm not sure you *should* be able to kill them if they're behaving as you describe. If they have solid intel at least one jump out and are sufficiently competent and cowardly to evac the moment they see anything that could provide hard tackle or killing power, that seems like the kind of preparation and behavior that should lead to minimal losses. I'm not exactly fond of gate camps, personally, but this game needs more people out in space, and a gate camp is at least that.
---
How expensive do you make these weapons? 
---
Thx for the cue! I hope your misfortune will do me good!
---
well.. its a cheap and easy to fly ship to ensure kills or to make sure you dont get killed by stop/dragbubbles.
---
tbh, i dont understand why most of the big null blocks only have a hand full of them in their fleets.
---
well, now i know that too
---
This! Yes. Too many acronyms, haha. I still love this game and the community, however. Love a steep learning curve.
---
The trouble here is it's almost impossible to tell a chat bot with a slightly randomised timer from a person doing ctrl+up every minute.
---
The best honest improvement that could be made to the game would be to convert all the math mechanics into formulas that naturally execute in a single cycle.  
---
This would allow massive tidi improvements on the order of 2 or even 3:1 on existing servers. 
---
See, software engineers like things like X^(y-b)/(c-p) but computers don’t.  
---
The cpu goes through conniptions to find the answer to that.  
---
... more when I’m drunk 
---
Well, that's pretty accurate, since TEST original members were from here.
---
Nothing of value was lost. Clean kill though. Look forward to test actually gets involved. 
---
PGL, how did these dreads get out. I thought Sirens and Burst Projectors were broken
---
i prefer the shield nyxes tbh..
---
General life pro tip, when you know there's a dread bomb waiting, and you have no fax support or scouts, or subcaps, or anything at all really, don't yolo in a super. Especially not 8 shitfit supers. Or at least 6 shitfit supers and 2 reasonable ones, credit there at least. 
---
I just really want a better reason for BS V to not be wasted right now.  Marauders are too expensive and caps do their job better and BLOPs are basically just soccer moms bridging the kids to covert cynos.  
---
So it's not the tools themselves, It's how you use them?
---
Got it.
---
On point! 
---
Welcome to Eve, everyone is a spy. 
---
Capital booshers that use a 'Jump Field Generator' to move everything around them not 100km... but to a cyno in another system? Like a 'bridge AND jump' titan? That could actually be interesting.
---
Well it is though, because it's exactly the same as the last post.
---
So it pre brigaded and will be reported to Reddit admin.
---
This. Like what if we didn't have 100 different half assed types of content? Sotiyos, drifters, shattered wormholes, diamond NPCs, NPC mining fleets, resource wars, etc., etc.
---
Nah, let's keep adding more half assed features! Abyssal enchanting and Abyssal thunder dome!!!
---
tssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
---
This would destroy the likes of NCPL who make up for a lack of numbers by having a disproportionately high rate of capital ownership.
---
I think this is a bad idea, supers need to be awesome, it gives new players something to aspire to own, like an endgame goal.
---
They all died, won't show up on the BR though until May 2020
---
&gt;Drop your super without having FAX alts on standby.
---
Big brain logic from the Impass trio.
---
A marauder would still get blapped by a super.. so, how does this change anything?
---
inb4 DhSJ grows to a decent size and pred “quits” again 
---
Whilst i think we can all agree that capitals and super caps are somewhat oppressive. I think a nerf at supers and titans is the wrong move.
---
The biggest problem i see to supercaps is the ability to kill them when their is faxes in play. As we have seen from all dread bombs since super change it is near impossible to pull off a dread bomb on a super cap fleet with ample fax support. Realistically you need something like 5 too 1 dreads to fax to pull it off, amd even then your likely to be around the same isk killed on both sidea with the dreads claiming victory cause duh insurance.
---
When coalition's can field their faxes in the hundreds their is no counterplay to that instead of more titans.
---
Nerfing the tank and rep amount of faxes i feel would have very little or no effect, as a fax alt is nothing for anyone who is super capabable to afford, myself i have 2 and could increase that with no problem if they got a general nerf.
---
I feel a better nerf that would impact the capital meta as a whole, would be to introduce diminishing returns on faxes repping a target. The more faxes repping a target the less effective their reps are until lets say 30-40 faxes total and any more on top do not apply any reps at all.
---
r9k mode on eve chat, lol.
---
Would be trivial to bypass though, they'd just add a . with every message.
---
Imagine being unable to think of a fight in this game that doesn't involve both sides CTA pinging for a week in advance.
---
Now take the gate
---
don't forget the Burst Projectors 
---
Seems like an actual battle to me if they voluntarily jumped in to shoot stuff.  They just got baited and jumped in with no links, no triage and bad fits against an opponent who was prepared and ready to execute.  
---
Marauder Damage Control Unit.
---
&gt; o you really think PGL would sacrifice the exact thing that made him and his alliance the second most powerful in the game because he is just annoyed one single time?
---
He's not though. Nothing he suggests is any threat to why the tapimperium are the biggest blob in 0.0. In fact, his suggestions are a clear buff to them and will allow them to burn regions without even having to move their supercap umbrella from delve/esoteria cause they can just outblob people in subs.
---
All his proposed changes accomplish is that stacking more basically free t1bcs is the endgame of eve with literally no counterplay to it.
---
This is so bad
---
I think EVE went to shit when they added HAW weapons and made it so battleships were no longer the main ship used in fleets.
---
Battleships should counter mass capital ships.
---
oh thank god, I almost gave up on this shitpost, because of the shit colors
---
Turns out dreadbombs actually work when the enemy is too stupid to bring faxes.
---
so, Bastion? Which gives shield/armor/hull resistances.
---
Like certain asteroids shatter and can be mined for a better profit or something to that affect.  So they switch every few minutes so pilots are engaged and are rewarded with decent isk an hour using just one account.  
---
You say take....i say destroy hahahahah.
---
&gt; You ever heared of our lord and saviout the scap umbrella. Making rorqs and most caps really hard to touch?
---
And that wouldn't be affected at all. All this does is nerf the ability to use caps to combat large fleets, not the small ones you see hunting "behind enemy lines" to kill rorqs.
---
Sounded like he knew exactly what he was talking about, just forgot to mention how it's not binary scenarios
---
says who?
---
I´d say the game itself isn´t that complicated anymore because pretty much all of EvE got discovered years ago. The complicated part comes from the "sub culture" this game bred over its lifespan. Understanding the all the lingu is hard and understanding why people post things the way they post it can be even harder. Spodbrains are like elephant brains, they will remember a lot of things and some of these things happened before the younger people here knew what a video game is. So when "old events" are getting referenced one can be lost. Same with all the famous/known characters and/or Alliances. Razor, BoB, the "Wizard Hat" for example are evergreens which will come up every now and then and you have to dig deep into EvEs rich history to understand. Other things are simply connected to certain political events or alike and if you are not part of them or followed them, you are clueless. 
---
I see nothing wrong with this. *Laughs in Vasari*
---
If you put a monkey into a main battle tank and said monkey just shits on the firing controls instead of using them doesnt mean said MBT isnt deadly
---
That's really exactly what I mean!
---
Right now with 400% tracking speed on comparable weapons systems, at that range they're impossible to get under the guns of. A ship that hits you 50km out currently can also hit Succubi at 10km just fine even--there is no other turret that can do that. It eliminates a lot of potential skill play and is the reason why you pretty much only see them going down with huge blobs or hard counters.
---
Brawling trig should just be as viable imo and offer faster ramp for more dps in practice, though not going so high that it outclasses blaster platforms at max ramp.
---
Hence my short/long proposal logic. Adding a tracking cut weakens them so you can outfly them, but at the same time you can buff them in other regards like speed to do better at hard counters without being overpowered once the power increases further. Makes a more balanced ship in a subcapital engagement that needs skill to dominate.
---
I get that hard counters exist and capitals have their own problems which trig ships are just beginning solving now, and that's great, but the ridiculous tracking makes their current engagement profile too black and white on what hulls show up to the fight imo, rather than having skill being a deciding factor.
---
I hope that flair is ironic
---
That's not a very nice way to talk about your coalition friends.
---
Isn't it interesting how a lot of popular comments are in the same vain even here
---
awesome dunk!
---
The was a *feature* for a while where you could fire an aoe DD through a cyno. 
---
Oh, I like this idea! Finally the baby dread it is supposed to be!

"I hated being surrounded in a sea of blues."

If you don't blue them up, they won't be blue to you?  
---
Anyways, the large blocks generally have capital support (but they have had capital support forever).  The smaller groups in null won't drops caps on you.  Or just focus on killing renters, who generally won't have a HD fleet. 
---
you're right he is
---
Aaaaah my eyes!!!

This post cured my previous headache by giving me a stronger headache.
---
I dont care if they are in my coalition, alliance, corp or RL friend.
---
If they do retarded shit I'll call them retarded
---
You may want to add a /s tag dude, most people here aren't seeing it well today.
---
I need to thank Kids with guns alliance  for the dread cache.
---
&gt; you gotta start at home
---
So that Legacy and CFC could steamroll them even more than they would now? Jfc, what planet are you from?
---
Weren't you a bigwig in PL which was easily the most risk averse group in Eve that basically died when it couldn't have risk free capital dunks?
---
Nah, the way it works in other games nowadays is that it works vs all "similar" messages, they do not have to be identical, just similar enough exactly and precisely to time out small changes in spammer messages.
---
the downside is that once in a while a legit player gets limited by this, I have been limited by it plenty of times myself, but it is the far lesser of the 2 evils.
---
\*8 supers
---
Please, CCP, just delete all caps and supers. They're entirely unnecessary and detrimental to the game.
---
I think the threat of the CFC steamrolling Test is very low, much less legacy. Considering they're in the same coalition and all.
---
Thats what it's listed at in Hot Ones.  It doesn't say it on the bottle I ordered, but having tried it solo and with a small amount mixed into some turkey and rice, it is easily the hottest thing I have ever eaten.  
---
You have a fundamental misunderstanding of how change is effected.  The volunteer to jump off the cliff first mentality has never worked, ever.
---
BSv is obsolete because of the warp speed and cap changes. Adding more ships won't make it relevant without rolling back at least the warp speed nerfs
---
I was like "oh! What a wonderful reference to Sins of a Solar Empire, a space game I like that isn't very common to see referenced!" but then I remembered what subreddit I'm on, and that probably 98% of the people here have played Sins.
---
Would need a counter nerf to dreads otherwise they will become the new meta.  And probably other things too. 
---
Force escalators need to remain otherwise it will be purely based on how many ships you can get on grid which suits taperium well.
---
To hammer the point.
---
Sounds like it needs rebalancing, too.
---
No it is true, my penis is very small.
---
Are you racist toward Caldari ? 
---
Neither has "moderation for thee, excess for me" and yet here you are
---
oh they are - if the supers can get there.
---
if you remove caps, nothing will change.  do you think that all of a sudden people will up and start fighting more over sov?  PvE players will find another ship to fly.  Miners will quit when there is nothing to build.  Pvpers will moan that there are no good targets anymore.  
---
Would kind of like the idea of having marauders  being able to fit specailized ant cap  or anti-fighters guns .  The anti fighter ones  would need a code rework that gives them some type of bonus damage against fighters. Same time the anti cap ones could have shit tracking but great DPS  with a similiar bonus against capitals . That would nerf cap warfare and allow   for greater subcap engagement

"AADP got rekd in MCCS by PME with  VPOTUS, rofl, Rorqual chain booshing"

Filling in the template with random acronyms from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._government_and_military_acronyms indeed creates a plausible EvE post.

Yep.

I too use alliance numbers and not actives on zkill
---
Rorqual survived....dread bomb fail.
---
&gt;"It's different now cause they updated some shit, so I don't know how, like, relevant it is anymore..."
---
I love how he brings up the current coalition map to show many different entities holding sov. But since it doesn't prove his point, he pulls up an old map and finds the specific time when it proves his point. 
---
Sounds like you're suffering from an acute case of being a fuckin poor.
---
I spent 8 years trying it your way.  I've got a proven track record of maintaining an alliance with supercap inferiority in this game.  In fact I'll put my record over the past 12 years of fighting without the supercap advantage in a real war against anyone else you can name.  Feel free to name any FC who's ran more wars against a supercap superior force than me.
---
I know what I'm about.
---
When I say delete supercaps I mean all supercaps including titans.
---
supers are OP
---
Maybe it would be better to explain to those pilots why their fits are garbage and what they can do better next time.
---
Oh, I'm retarded. I don't know why I associated PGL with GotG/Panfam. Been out of the game for too long.  
---
There are plenty of enemies who are more than willing to use caps/supercaps though, and it would seriously limit their ability to do anything defensively/offensively without batphoning somebody who does have caps.
---
Why not both?
---
Jesus Christ +1 to this. That sounds great.
---
/u/CCP_Falcon please throw this post at the right team. 
---
(~~)Honor atorn brawl(~~) Honorable dockup?
---
ah ok. Yeah I guess, I mean titan bridging is okay but I can live without that.
---
It's almost like you can use rigs to choose what you want your ships to specialize on, while losing out on other options(Speed, Tank) when doing so.
---
Honestly, the trip ships are for the most part the most balanced new entries CCP has added in a LONG while.  Not boring, not OP, and pretty solid.  The Damavik and Vedmak need some love, but they are all in a decent place. 
---
Except the Damavik, it really is just awful.  If anyone has a fit for it please prove me wrong, I would love to fly it. 
---
You don't feel supers and titans are enoigh of a counter as is?
---
I guess what im envisioning is when 200 dreads are dropped on a super fleet 10 - 15 titans day instead of 0 - 2 then all the dreads get cleaned up by the remaining supers and subcap fleet.
---
I get your point though i think for a first nerf faxes should be the target and then too approach another aspect once the meta has shifted to accommodate the fax nerf.
---
Not in caps, that has been relatively recent since Goons were evicted from Dek and setup their Delve production powerhouse.
---
Yea, impossible .... especially the vast majority of which are doing it 23.5 / 7 .... just impossible ..... just can't find them .....

---
Can't argue the rest. Quality manifesto - newsletter, subscribe, etc.
---
Maybe someone can send some video of for your argument on nerfing capitals.
---
Lol gaypwnd
---
I disagree with you entirely.
---
Now if you said, nerf capitals + give marauders XL weapons + bring down their costs so that you can get maybe 4-5 fully fitted ones for the price of 1 fully fitted dread, then I might give you some credit and thought, but as is, I look at a post like this and I think to myself:
---
O look, another NS crab or bot that is trying to troll to minimize any possible damage to himself ...
---
At least they got 1 titan. 
---
The Corm's DPS is applied instantly, and at max DPS.  The kiki needs to apply for a minute to hit max dps.  In reality, in shorter engagements, you are looking at much much lower DPS.
---
That'd be a lost cause
---
A nice little site for basic market stuff.
---
Has automatic layouts for regular goods, ore, moon goo, salvage, pi, ice, T3 mats etc. Nothing major but nice to be able to look at several product prices, both buy &amp; sell and especially in several hubs. So no need to keep switching location in evepraisal.
---
New rogue drone skins for SoE ships only $29.99
---
im loving what is going on with skillU and Scourge. keep up the GFs
---
I guess we can just remove all weaponry from titans and they can be bridge bitches.
---
Watching the votes go up and down,damn legacy boiis are really salty
---
Legacy juniors trying to do something without daddy Test. Goes as expected.
---
You know, its funny you say that. As I've reading the comments I was thinking to myself that I would gladly give up my titan, 2 supers and dozens of caps if I could get just one good alpha fleet brawl a week.
---
[Fixed It](https://imgur.com/a/Tv0NkRU)
---
i guess brave won't be dropping supers in impass either lmao 
---
Dont cut scanres and Im ok with whatever nerf you want
---
He literally did that in the post you replied to originally.
---
where did we get a nyx and why did it persist so long
---
I don't intend to take that away and that's a role which honestly more subcaps should have a hope at. Being able to spodbrain a single insured carrier and force off 90% of small gangs is not a great dynamic.
---
I recognize that, and it should definitely be preserved, and carriers as a whole looked at.
---
However my issue is how bipolar trig ships are with subcap small scale fights. A lot of the comments are saying that trig ships are okay because hard counters can be brought--but that's exactly the issue. They track so well at the ranges they shoot at with respectable dps that many ships that do not hard counter them simply cannot engage outside of a blob, while hard counters pretty much seal the deal. Having a battlecruiser that tracks interceptors over a huge range of ranges is not conducive to piloted counterplay. Imagine if Harbingers had their tracking quadrupled in the next patch.
---
While my solution is crude and thrown together on the spot I think people can understand why that is an issue.
---
The fact that hard counters exist is an entirely separate issue. Soft, skill-based counters should exist. If the kiki is too weak against hard counters after cutting its tracking, then it can be buffed in other regards like speed, initial dps, dps acceleration, and tank that make it workable by a skilled pilot.
---
Essentially I believe the trig line, particularly with regards to tracking, suffers from a problem that the fight is far too heavily decided by *what* ships undock rather than how intelligently those ships are flown.
---
While I 100% agree with you, bridging subs wont be as cancerous, they take a lot more people to do properly, if they make a mistake they're actually killable, and you can split them up and kill subs.
---
Ask any experienced small gang pvp pilot, like u/Michael_Wilmore here, a fleet of subs kills content a lot less than a few supers.
---
Oh, and because they require more people to not just be ripped apart by subs, these response fleets will need to form up and finding that many people and getting them on a titan will take time and effort.
---
They are tankier &amp; can dish out more DPS than a battleship, give the player increased risk in a sense that once you bastion, you stay there.
---
Basically movement slows down, and dps, tank etc increases. Nice little mid-point between regular battleship gameplay and capitals.
---
Altough, now that I think of it, they could make a drone marauder? Bastion is short example of siege, so a subcap that also models carrier gameplay in a way with battleship size (comparable to marauder) would be a neat little shipline.
---
way more accurate than i was expecting. agree 100%
---
It’s nothing to aspire to anymore as you can have a new char and a box of skill injectors ... instant cap pilot.
---
he couldn't turn his hardeners on so there's that
---
That's uh, quite a difference in ships lol. 
---
Battle bots

Blasters &amp; Balls!  That’s some fun sh*t.

Marauder re-work.
---
Marauders get a jump drive, same distance as a dread.
---
Marauder hull price reduced to maybe 6-800m
---
Remove HAW from dreads

Marauders now anti-subcap dreadlight option.

I actually fucking LOLed. Good post
---
Caldari is the enemy, after all.
---
Oh there's no question that TEST has historically been disadvantaged in cap numbers but let's not whitewash history and pretend that was by design. You help lead a largely newbro friendly alliance, and for most of the time you and I have been playing, almost every alliance has been at a disadvantage in terms of cap numbers. Super caps were rare enough that they weren't seriously used by most groups in real numbers. EVERYONE except for a token few groups at any given time didn't rely on supercap supremacy to win fights - because they couldn't. Rorquals and injectors changed that dynamic and now - shocker - you're fine blobbing with caps because you have to be, or else you'll lose objectives. That's true for most groups. I don't hold that against you. But it makes your message more than a little hollow, especially since you only raised it after it negatively impacts you. I see you asked your alliance to send you videos of fights where they got blobbed by caps. Should we also ask them to send you videos of themselves dropping supers on roaming gangs? Because it sure comes across as shameless whining when you get a taste of your own medicine. 
---
I'm not seriously arguing you should jump off the cliff first. I'm arguing that begging CCP to fix the problems you're yourself perpetuating isn't going to work. 
---
Chill piggly, just add dreads to your nerf list
---
Check again.
---
Doesn't take that long in the grand schemes of eve...
---
Something Something millenials &amp; instant gratification xD 
---
Not to mention Jam or Damp support can easily knock them off a target, forcing the spool up to start over. 
---
It read to me like he was throwing them under the bus rather than giving genuine advice.
---
&gt;Seems like an actual battle to me if they voluntarily jumped in to shoot stuff.  They just got baited and jumped in with no links, no triage and bad fits against an opponent who was prepared and ready to execute.
---
wasnt an actual battle. Cap fleet wasnt done forming but skillu started anchoring cyno inhibs. fc called for carriers to jump to kill it but some super pilots who were used to swinging their dick and having gankers run off jumped too  and got whelped
---
The game's balance fell down there a few years ago; we're still waiting for it to hit bottom so we can pick it back up again.
---
Which would unironically make caps safer.
---
what you now say, is that TEST/Imperium is soon no match to anyone anymore. The times where people from TEST/Imperium have super/titan caches all over eve is not that far out...
---
We both know that is bullshit and eve has ALWAYS evolved. If you want to weaken Test/Imperium, what would you do? I mean, that is what you ultimately want since you turn everything into a bohoo-"Test/Imperium just want to become stronger and have no interest in making the game healthier"
---
flair baiting idiots is the current r/eve meta
---
Dude your videos got me flying an Auto Tornado.  I gotta say, I really like it.

Everything he mentioned was a legitimate issue with the fits.

And then a nerf. Gotta cashout before you nerf stuff!

but tbf, would that interfere with us spamming Amarr Victor in local  when we take a system? We feel strongly about our ability to spam Amarr Victor.  
---
Yup. There are resources for everything in EVE. Those that think it’s hard just want a game to tell them what to do at every step. The confusing parts are the “inside jokes” of the community. Some are easy to understand, like El’Miner, but if you just started playing in the last year you might not know about, say, Willem Crane’s Onyxs.
---
Okay that was it  
---
Our CEO informed the full coalitionpower is now in W A R
---
Indeed it always hurt the brawler more.
---
I'd be ok with this.
---
shit happens we all make mistakes, no worries
---
People aren't supposed to come kill them and the fact you think nobody would come help actually plays into the purpose of the mechanic.  They're intended to slow down the rate at which rorqs can mine without interruption and pose an actual threat to AFK mining simply by losing excavators.
---
Rats already target excavators first over 60% of the time... Sure, but it still takes them 5 minutes to kill a single excavator because the current rats are crap lol
---
In all fairness, bombers were kind of a whimsical idea anyway, though if the AI recognizes there are no exhumers in the belt then, hey, why not.  Make things interesting.
---
Bounties on belt rats is crap anyways so, whatever :)
---
1-2 logis, handful of battleships, few cruisers.  Rorqs have to pull in excavators and use sentries/drones to kill maybe 8-10 actual ships rather than the crap ships which currently spawn.
---
A decently fit rorq isn't going to die to a squad like that, just be set back 5-10 minutes per hour.
---
AFK miners could conceivably take a hit.
---
make it so that only caps can use cynos
---
 Friends, I would appreciate some advice from you regarding wormholes.  
---
I  have been exploring WHs for a couple of days now with a cheap magnate  and it's been a pleasant experience so far with no kills and plenty of  loot. However, many sites are guarded by either sleeper drones or  pirates, which has become a real issue. So I figured it would be a good  idea to buy a ship that can get rid of them. But I don't know how  dangerous those enemies are and which ship to choose. I've heard gila is  good but it's too expensive. There is also VNI but I'm not sure if it's  a viable choice for an alpha clone.  
---
Anyway, my questions are -  how do I gauge the strenght and danger level of enemies? Which enemies  should I engage and which should I run from? What ship should I use to  kill them (preferably alpha friendly)?   
---
Thanks. 
---
Don't forget a griffin warping in, jamming and leaving forcing your spool to restart and massively gimping DPS.  Rinse and repeat.  
---
Gotta have somewhere to throw the dark side Lords when they get uppity.
---
Because you need situational awareness to actually do those without the FC having to babysit you.
---
imagine how much more oppressive this would have been with a GTFO.
---
I hope this doesn't go ahead, mainly because I don't think that the game should be designed around one person's jihad. I think that's a dangerous game and doesn't really bode well for future revolts.

That being said, I'm all for specialisation, i.e. caps not being as effective against sub caps

---
Sure, the speed, dps, and utility is nice, but if you get shot at in any way you will die. I think a flight of Warrior IIs could almost definitely kill you before you can do anything.
---
&gt; Everyone in the game from Brave to PL said fozziesov sucked after testing it before it was even on TQ. There was also an entire year between the release of those 2 things. 
---
what?! Fozzy sov is fucking great. I mean ye, it had weaknesses but now:
---
ceptor fleets were annoying and not really fun --&gt; not viable after ceptor change
---
remote support immunity prevented fights for the beacons --&gt; allowed now
---
long range entosis prevented "normal fights" --&gt; no long range entosis anymore
---
uncontested entosis is boring --&gt; well uncontested ANYTHING is boring, so get over it and be happy you won the objective, also it got shortened a bit
---
anything I missed? Fozziesov warfare is one of the most interesting types of warfare, and I'm pretty sure many, who were in actual contested Fozziesov wars within the last year would agree with me..
---
Yeah I finally deleted it too
---
\m/ &gt;.&lt; \m/
---
but can also be utilized to push a narrative.
---
I think too many try to "break up the big groups", it will just never have that effect regardless of what people suggest. 
---
The game in itself sucks, really, its the people I hang out with that are fun. Interacting with fellow goons on mumble, goonfleet forum, jabber, in-game channels, THAT is the fun bit. The game is just sort of a backdrop for this. 
---
\------------------- break line, different topic---------
---
Another issue seems to be that half the universe doesn't make their own Delve region. 
---
It doesn't really matter how balanced the game is "technically", if one side plays the game in a way which make them perpetually bankrupt from the line-member level to the alliance SRP-wallet. 
---
Maybe pandafam doesn't make their own delve because the leaders are lazy and don't care that their line-members have to grind many many hours to make ends meet. 
---
Or maybe there could be some quality of life UI improvements for alliance and corp leaders to more easily plan out a delve system. 
---
Or maybe each pandafam alliance leader wants to steal isk from the alliance to plex his own accounts and get more titans for himself. And thus don't want to merge with other alliances to make a delve region with high activity and high safety. 
---
Or maybe pandafam just needs to get under one alliance ticker so that the few in each group that want to put in work to make a delve, can make a delve. 
---
Or maybe pandafam just needs to accept other soldiers than Rambo into their ranks. Generals can't afford to only accept Rambo to basic training. Where would goons or test be if we only accepted the "elite PVP" type? We F\*\*\*ing won the war with our useless krab-people we sent through a basic-training of sorts, after just two years of the delve model. So surely elite pvpers would beat us if they just "delved" properly for six months?

You should consider them combat sites, not exploration. Pirate sites will be unguarded and these are the ones explorers are looking for, they will be found in C1-3s only with the exception of Covert research Facilities (Ghost Sites) that can be found in any class. 
---
The sleeper data and relic sites are not really worth it from a hacking perspective, very few people run them as such.

I dont think they are suggesting making subcaps useless for bashing.. but right now you can bash down structures with like 3 trig Battleships at the same speed and effectiveness as 3 dreadnaughts.    Which is odd... 
---
Also it would be nice if structures werent tankable by like 3 cruiser logi. It is a bit off balanced.
---
Honeslty I wouldn't care if they didnt touch the structure system. To me the entire idea of having super carriers with instant lock and perfect application to subs is a mind blowing oversight.
---
The cheap cost of caps and their sheer ridiculous effectiveness on subs is out of control. Why spend 4.5 bil on a marauder when you can spend 2.5 on and cap and get 10 times the firepower and tank.  
---
It is the entire reason i rarely leave wh space.
---
“Batphones for honor brawls” yes keep lying about this, i told you in local “fight” after you dropped carriers on nerds in subs then you cry when we drop carriers on you in return lul.

it seldom actually is

There's really no telling how many good fights had to end abruptly because some asshat decided to drop their Ragnarok or Hel on a small gang. It just creates an impossible situation for the majority of casual players. It's not fun getting shit on over and over.

Wormholes are divided into different classes, from C1 to C6, with each class having increasingly difficult combat sites and increasingly valuable loot drops. A resource like Rykki’s guide illustrates the expected damage output of each site, as well as the value. Plan your engagements very carefully using this resource, or else you’ll rapidly find yourself dying to a site more challenging than expected.
---
A C1 site can be completed by a junker cruiser, a C2 site can be completed in a well prepared Battlecruiser or faction cruiser, and a C3 or above will generally be optimally cleared using faction Battleships or larger. VNIs and Gilas are indeed suitable for C1 and C2 sites, with Gilas being preferred for their tank. 
---
On another note, if you want to clear wormhole relic and data sites so you can hack those cans, I wouldn’t bother for most of them since the actual hacking can drops are typically worth pennies.
---
Step 1: Remove NSAs.
---
make the drops more valuable and the problem will solve itself... For used citadels: make a part of the asset safety fee go to the killers of the citadel. The unused ones, well that is a bigger problem... but I think something could be found

As someone who started the game in Geemu, Destiny never really knew anything about EVE. It's amazing that we really accomplished anything at all, but looking back we did some amazingly stupid shit in an effort for him to "change" the meta. And it's great that Destiny complains about a lot of the shit we used to have to deal with as a Brave-esque corp, but as we got bigger we 100% did the same shit so...

i have an industry question as its vexing me . Can you build   regular freighters  in non cap building facilities . I know you can build the orca in one .

then you're not paying attention

Wait, which game are you playing? Certainly not EvE in major fights.

Special mention to the absolute hero Scourge dread pilot that was there to kill the supers on the initial drop, jumped out to safety after the kills, gets tackled in the out system, gets saved and immediately says 'hold my vodka' and jumps back in to finish the rorqual.

So nerf dreads? 
---
Weren't you a shitty nobody who latched onto the biggest teet he could find in game so he'd never have to know what actual risk looks like?
---
Granted I am fairly new (14m SP) but the main thing that drives me nuts about caps is their ability to defend themselves vs frigate/destroyer/cruiser sized ships. If that was a legitimate weakness then there would be space for a more balanced fleet, and would allow newbros to better participate in conflicts.

Try getting a few carrier drops under the belt. Maybe a few large scale carrier ops before considering a super. Perhaps t2 fighters and carrier V. Or just inject into one and hope for the best. Either way, some people don't have the game sense to utilize a super without getting swatted. Take it or leave it.
---
it helped for nullsec. and did the opposite for jspace.
---
5 t3 builds into 1 for armor-brawls atleast
---
but they die instantly when neuted
---
Rorqs die to 30 caracals. 
---
This is the correct answer. They should shit on subcaps and be shit on by caps. Right now they are only shit on by caps. I also think they should cost about as much as a navy faction ship instead of a capital.
---
So I just found a first person camera. What's it good for?
---
Yep. Highsec and everything.
---
anti cyno module for BO's, focused Bombs like void, just with the normal ones for Bombers would be my dream.

100+ man bomber fleet spent an hour trying to kill this. Finally had to bring in another 100 to finish it off. Nothing wrong here

Personally - this 100% made my day. These guys love to drop on any and every fleet that enters that pocket. I love it when they yolo around thinking they can just yolo caps in Impass and get cucked. Warms my heart!
---
Probably also higher then that in general considering it's been given out for free a few times.
---
Balance is really in the eye of the beholder though. Obviously there are problem, but what isn't obvious is what is the best way to fix them. You put a team of two people in charge of this and they will probably end up wanting to hang themselves after the second balance pass. We all know how the community reacts to changes.
---
Second point I wanted to make is that the foundation of Eve's skilling system would make it really difficult for a lot of players to keep up with the meta. If we were to start getting frequent balance passes it's really going to screw with things. People will spend weeks or months to be able to properly fly a specific ship only to realize its no longer relevant. 
---
If there were some sort of reset button you could hit that would let you redistribute a portion or all of your  skillpoints every couple months or however long that didn't cost you billions upon billions I don't think it would be an issue. But that won't ever happen IMO.
---
my honest question, why propaganda-y? they got different commentators with different views, unlike most others. And Matterall, well he might be in NC. but wtf, that guy is like a child looking at a butterfly when it comes to Eve politics (understand my right, I love that), he looks with full interest, has no idea what is going on, but all that matters is that it looks and sounds cool
---
Doesn't much matter if its worth using caps if one side is perpetually too broke to lose them (pandafam), because they don't want to make a high-density region where people can make tons of isk quickly by scaling manufacturing, salvage, reactions, mining, ratting, trade, contracting, etc. 
---
i mean ur just fullfilling whats said in the post , reddit alliance , first group to respond and to complain. gg ;) played yourself there
---
Quite true. Same does go for many of the dreadnaughts as well. You see a dreadnaught say soloing a C5 site. You neut it, it dies. Or even if you see one say at a site in nullsec, lowsec etc doing whatever.
---
Nobody has a problem with people using their caps. The issue is that these ships weren't designed with the expectation that every subcap pilot in a fleet would also have at least a dread/fax +super/titan toon at the ready. That's where where we're at right now. The function of the ships needs to be narrowed to accommodate more varied gameplay. Exclusively subcap pvp is actually decently balanced and engaging across multiple scaled of fleet size. maybe the best it's ever been in Eve's lifespan. It's truly a shame that there's less incentive than ever to pursue that avenue in a fight. Rather than fixing the problem PL caused by oppressing the entire map with power projection, we have lots of groups oppressing like PL did in their own given area. 
---
the issue isn't that people are using their caps, it's that they're using them for everything
---
waddup bap
---
Can confirm
---
no u read it wrong they should buff supers so they can get on grid faster
---
If you factor in insurance they are vastly more expensive than a capital

if you're looking for honor brawls, the best by far in my experience is the muddy and mostly unloved waters between Sosala and Sosan which seems to be shared in equal parts by the chinese players and the fledgling USTZ amarrmil corps
---
The chinese Amarr are blobbers at heart, but their base incompetence makes what should be a blob on their part turn into an accidental good fight because they seem to not understand how anything in the game works ??? or just vastly misjudge how long it will take their Worms to align and slide in

Can't allow something that you know nothing about.

@everyone my last ping, check it out and look through if you see any familiar names making posts please upboat (can’t use other word it breaks terms) thanks for ur support
---
hi i was in tri during the old nc era, we had a dread fight in syndicate between tri/white noise and cry havoc/pl that set a record in 2009 for most capitals involved and it was barely 60 on a side so
---
you're full of shit my dude g'bye
---
&gt;what you now say, is that TEST/Imperium is soon no match to anyone anymore. The times where people from TEST/Imperium have super/titan caches all over eve is not that far out...
---
It's very apparently still far away enough for test to get their teeth kicked in when they're not supported by their whole coalition and the goon superfleet combined. The only entity close enough to be able to move a viable super fleet around the map while still maintaining enough supers at home is goons and even they can't keep that up for more than a few weeks at a time before all their krabs start crying because they're actually dying at home now.
---
 &gt;If you want to weaken Test/Imperium, what would you do?
---
* Remove Injectors. 
---
* Make rorqs not box-able.
---
*  Remove Panic.
---
*  Remove the retarded new jump gates again. 
---
* Have running indexes in systems that deplete anoms when they're mined/ratted too much. 
---
* Massively up 0/low-&gt;0 wormhole generation and/or make them harder/more dangerous to roll, scale this generation with the activity index from above. 
---
*  Remove Insurance on all T1 hulls. Adjust Dreads and dreads only to a pre-insurance nerf price. 
---
* Severely nerf T1 comp viability. 
---
* Add (support needing) heavy tackle back into the game instead of removing more of it.
---
* Bring back the equivalent of old Ahacs before the T3C nerf and link nerf.
---
*  In general, reverse the sig-link nerf. 
---
* Remove defender launchers. 
---
* Rework Citadels and sov from the ground up and move it to a halfway point between what we have now and post-phoebe Dominion.
---
* Nerf tracking on lr fibos, HAWs and light fighters.
---
Basically reverse most of the changes of the last 2 years that entered the game cause people bitched they couldn't just throw more insured, basically free T1 doctrines at a problem to make it go away.
---
The solution to combat massive blue blobs like tapimperium isn't to make spamming T1BC the be-all end-all in Eve. It's to force them to spread out over much, much larger swathes of 0.0 to even begin to cope with their current demand for space. A coalition the Size of Goons should have to be spread out over 4-5 regions actively used at minimum. If you remove concentration

---
hey capqu how r u

can you elaborate

should probably ask what he was doing right. how many times since dual asb was removed have you seen a 10m damage rorq kill? whether it was 7 or 200 attacking.

Story time:
---
I’m on the way to Fanfest. It’s going to be Fanfest 2 or 3, it’s a long time ago. I’m in the airport, going to the gate that will take us to Iceland. There’s a group there. They have a certain attire, their gear has certain aspects to it. I hear a conversation. I know immediately, and without doubt: these are my people. They are discussing the relative merits of drag bubbles and how to use them.
---
There is an elderly man next to them, who is listening to the conversation in utter bewilderment. This is the picture the man sees: a group of 6 late 20s, early 30s males. They are not drunk, they are not high, they are most definitely not bullshitting and they obviously know, in quite some detail what they’re talking about. Their voice is forceful and speaks with the force of conviction. The man understands [almost] all the words they speak, yet doesn’t understand word one of what he is hearing.
---
I arrive at the gate, I’m taking a seat next to them in the row. The man looks at me. I’m in civilian clothes. My gear bears logos and symbols that only have meaning to the cognoscenti. To him they’re just words on a bag. He looks at me, a half-conspirational look *Are these guys for real? What the hell are they even talking about?!*, I direct my attention to the group’s conversation, I listen to what they’re saying, I turn to the man and signal *Yeah, sounds about right, makes perfect sense to me.*”
---
The look on his face **Oh my god, he’s one of them!**, was priceless. That look, dear friends, that’s what you go to Fanfest for.
---
/true story
---
You go to Fanfest because you don’t have to find a way to ‘explain what that EVE thing is you’re always talking about’. You go find the people who understand it on the same level you do.
---
To meet the nerds, make friends, talk to devs, have [way too goddamn fucking much] beer, to bask in the glory that is EVE.
---
To the people who know it, it’s obvious, you don’t need to explain it. To those who don’t know it... what can I tell you? 
---
I've seen ads that can help
---
More the cost of the dread. Very cheap after insurance.  
---
Maybe make faxes able to be repped in triage.  A good dread bomb should kill more supers titans currently. PGL recent dreadbomb was a mess, they had cynos around the grid and had short range dreads jumping in at 100km and trickling in. 
---
I don't disagree that fax are op currently but there is a very fine line between op and totally useless and better of putting fax alts into dreads
---
Certainly not. If CCP actually has problems understanding how to identify them, I'm more than happy to tell them how to.  
---
Regardless. The contract and message history is enough. No one is constantly spamming Jita local 24/7 at 10-25 second intervals for several weeks straight. That would literally leave you dead.
---
Refilling your entire capacitor vs running a nsa and some resists.
---
Pretty huge difference there.
---
Meh, drop a handful of well fit caps on an armor brawl comp with properly fit support ships and they’ll shit on the subcap fleet all the same. If one group has smooth brain syndrome, it can change that outcome so it’s still better than how it is for the rest of the game cap balance wise at least 
---
obviously that too, it looks like they might have already gotten to the first two
---
I was in NC back in late 2010 to mid 2011.  We'd have cap fleets of 100-200, backed by a wing of basi's.
---
How tf did Winmatar end up  with 4/5 small gang competence. 
---
Keepstar Ratting. Fly into a Haven, anchor a Keep, come back next day, launch DD, unanchor, rinse and repeat. Makes me 30 mil ISK per tick...
---
...once per week...
---
Step 2: Remove subcaps.
---
I had been up all night. Downtime was usually my notification to go to bed. I decided to derp on eve for a few. Little did I realise that the call would go out and for the next 21 hours I stayed on grid in my Aeon and with a group of about 50 supers slowly started killing dreads. My cap was bugged at 29%. At some point I started taking aggro, I had no idea, a corpie in a carrier had me locked and was scanning me with updates on cap and armor. I couldn't align anywhere by double clicking. I had a decent time controlling my fighters and fighter bombers though so the dps kept pouring out. I discovered I could approach to control my direction and had that same corpie scanning me guide my Aeon out of the bubbles to finally be able to jump out at 9% armor. B-R, for me fighting on the N3 side, was one of my highest highs I could experience in Eve to date. Running on 0 sleep and having 50b in super and implants on grid was a rush like no other I have ever experienced in a video game. I look forward to another large battle where I can get this adrenaline rush I so desire.
---
Exactly.
---
This would have totally been a sick burn if you hadn’t become irrelevant and Asher didn’t just lead probably the most successful offensive in EVE.
---
Ah trail by ordeal..
---
0w0 what's dis?
---
Next PGL will want buff to supers
---
Debate me.
---
The first time you’re in that kind of conversation, where someone says something that is jargon front to back, and your response is: yeah, that’s right. And you understand you just said that: yeah, I get what you’re saying, when that conversation has no meaning to anyone else, that moment you understand you’ve found your place in the universe.

This fuckin mong just wants to be able to solo a drekavak in his heron. 
---
(seriously tho, fuck off. leave the trig ships alone. if caps get to be pure cancer, allow some subcabs to be good) 
---
or actually combat fit the supers (not that it would have mattered here)
---
&gt; I spent 8 years trying it your way. I've got a proven track record of maintaining an alliance with supercap inferiority in this game.
---
are you actually trying to use "nulli seconda wasn't a powerful supercap alliance" as a premise for your position and completely disregard the fact that during the era of "there are only two coalitions in eve" you were in one of them
---
because if so holy fuck you're so stupid i might actually jump off a bridge
---
Rens is dead as a can of spam. Minmatar trade wasn't bustling at the game's peak and for whatever reason people refuse to pick one of Hek or Rens to become the 'main' hub so what little trade there is remains split between them.
---
If you're in highsec couriers are so fucking cheap I'd personally just ship it to Jita and have an alt ready to sell it. If you're in the FW lowsec just use Dodixie like everyone else :)
---
It's actually not that deep. I had a camera glitch due to a desync once and could zoom all the way out of the model. It's only a cone.
---
bring a single caracal. you dont need a blob or a capital drop to fight it.
---
Fuck off with these. turn your attention to the state of capital ship balance before we tackle balancing sub caps. otherwise it will end up with heavy handed nerfs getting rid of a new, fun and capable meta.   
---
You realize nulli secunda was older than 6 months right.
---
I'd give helpful, not rude advice *if* said people would ask me before risking their expensive space ships in a stupid manner not after. Or if they admit "yeah that was stupid of me, I fucked up, anyone got any advise how to do better next time?"
---
I believe you missed Sahtogas off the map there
---
Or just let them fit a point defense system that instagibs fighters.
---
eh? I didn't even rate them
---
IIRC NC / PL were the ones that forced this era of EVE Online by first forming a mega coalition to take out Goons from Deklein and then stabbing Test in the back forcing them out and set up ‘enemy of my enemy’ diplomacy. Correct me if I’m wrong though!
---
Nothing. Maybe flying around a citadel while tethered to look at big ships like titans from a first person view 
---
"Having a battlecruiser that tracks interceptors over a huge range of ranges is not conducive to piloted counterplay. "
---
Have you heard of the RLML ?    CCP is in the buisness of making this game more simple and easier.
---
haw dreads.  un-supported capital ships, rlml caracal/cerb fleets, and triglavian tracking.  These are all problems.  
---
CCP has clearly shown a desire to keep heading down this path.  Leave my triglavian ships alone, if the blob gets their caracal fleets , haw dreads and carriers, allow me the joy of my drekavak and stfu. 
---
With T1 rigs and T2 DDC. I would be ashamed to poorfit a super like that.

Did you read the thread at all? If you did you would know exactly what happened and why it went 'poof'.

You didn't, but thanks!

&gt; don't complain, don't feed, and don't be dumb

Did they complain, though?

when you see bots that you have reported weeks/months ago through both the ingame "report bot" tool and the security@ccpgames.com email still happily botting away, you start losing faith
---
this guy just wants to solo a leshak with his heron. 
---
it's kind of endearing, they're not shitlords so they're fine by me
---
Against people everyone knows can’t fight back, yeah it’s genereally going to go better.
---
I’d recommend joining a Corp like Pandemic Horde or Brave, and ask your questions in their channels/comms, join fleets, and try out different parts of the game. Just because you’re in a nullsec alliance doesn’t mean you can’t go to a faction warfare area and mess around with t1 frigates. 
---
As long as you are on comms, or at least listening in, and joining fleets, you should get the basics of the game down pretty quickly. And don’t worry about being alpha, both alliances I mentioned will accept alphas, no matter how new they are 
---
There is a gargantuan difference between Orca boosts and Rorq boosts....
---
Send me a billion isk in game and I’ll unban you
---
Winmatar can't even bring enough ammo to a hub bash.
---
Decided to do some maths to prove you wrong.
---
Example is a Thanatos with one T1 capital capacitor booster running 3 resists and nsa constantly.
---
Fit and numbers: [https://i.imgur.com/P3SliDa.png](https://i.imgur.com/P3SliDa.png)
---
&gt;Natural regen +54.6  
---
&gt;Running NSA + 3 resists constantly = -54.5  
---
&gt;delta = +0.1 (negligible)   
---
&gt;68.8k cap pool  
---
&gt;25% cap after jump = 17.2k  
---
&gt;75% cap to be regained = 51.6k  
---
&gt;Capital capacitor booster I = 75s/5charges + 10s reload  
---
&gt;16k cap every 85s  
---
&gt;so   
---
&gt;\+16k = 85s or 1 min 25s  
---
&gt;\+32k = 170s or 2 mins 50s  
---
&gt;\+48k = 255s or 4 mins 15s  
---
&gt;\+64k = 340s or 5 mins 40s
---
SO in fact with ONE capital cap booster you fully recharge your cap even WITH running your NSA constantly.
---
If you are considering neuts then yes you may need a second cap booster to be completely full (pretty unnecessary) but that's your fitting decision.
---
Please post this as NSFW next time, OP
---
They'd go wild for sure. CCP should just give us some sort of editor where we as players can paint directly on hulls in multiple layers, define materials and lights.

That’s one opinion 
---
i'm not sure what point you're trying to make here - that after the halloween war when n3 broke up it somehow didn't count anymore?
---
or what
---
like
---
your original point was that you've spent a long time fighting wars against people with more supercaps than you but fuck dude, blue supers count - it's the same sword of damocles over your enemies' heads whether they wear your alliance ticker or not
---
or do you have no idea what the hbc was? mbc? tesco? i could go on
---
the fact that the number of supercaps with blue stars on them during your wars has been less than the ones with red minuses doesn't excuse you from being a part of the same system as everyone else, whether or not you fancy yourself a subcap specialist
---
and that's just one of three points i made in my post, that you zero-effort responded to

You don’t normally see how deep it is unless you’re shaders are on low.
---
My head cannon is it’s a opening to the other hangers/storage areas that all the cargo drones go to/from to load up your ship.
---
Rookie ships and shuttles don't give you killmarks, you have to spend at least ~300k/hull for t1 frigates.
---
Not that that would stop people.

Nulli was 3 years old already when we formed N3.

Honestly I don't know why I engage with you.  You've always been dense

Is it? They hide it with all but low shaders.

We're not even that good anymore TBH. We've been reduced to tagging along to their gate camp on the Oijanen gate in BWF these days.

I don't disagree on supers shooting at subcaps, the issue is how well and how oppressive it is, without any support on grid. Supers shredding BS is fine and acceptable, supers able to point, web and apply basically as much DPS to a cruiser is not.

Capital and most importantly supers and titans need to be good at fighting for large fights, killing structures and being oppressive toward heavy BS fleets. They should not be the hard counter to roams. That's a not a niche that's just fairness.
---
That's what made the good drop excellent.
---
It would influence everyone, why have a fleet every hour just to give the 1 or two rorq mining a hand with rats? You would only cause more capital problems because all the rorqs would have a super alt because it takes a fleet to break two  of the log I.

TBH I think abyssal is the best over content they've added since Apocrypha, but let's not quibble. Fix the shit.

Yes and some people might not want to build an empire as they way to have fun in the game. Some people just want their alliance to be a solid PvP group. Now it's not about the group with less supers should have the ability to fight the group with less, it's about how supers shouldn't be the perfect counter to every situation.
---
[Here, I helped.](https://zkillboard.com/ship/33468/losses/)
---
I'm actually fine with the bubbles and the warp strength, but the rest is bullshit
---
pretty easy to give them a resistance to fighter damage as well... they'd be a well placed capital support ship at that point (without really affecting their PvE roles).
---
I agree with your sentiments, but if CCP have given no indication they'll listen or make changes based on community feedback, why should we even give a fuck any more?
---
So if capitals were needed to kill structures then there would be no reasonably effective way to kill structures in high sec or low class wormholes right?
---
I can relate to this. I took a break for 3 years and come back and find you can fit a carrier for less then 2 billion and its significantly more dps.

Yeah the usefulness of them is limited because of the loss of remote repair but still.

Now they are absolutely everywhere and mean little.

I'm torn on so many level. It's fun to see Pl shit talking TEST about dreadbombs when I remember PL loosing 3 relatively large dread bombs to TEST and INIT in quick succession, so it's basically two groups throwing their own shit at each other and it's pretty fun.
---
On the other hand, I'm glad to see Brave super fleet eating shit because they have been using dropping them on a whole lot of people that used to get fights on their home space but not anymore. So somewhat deserved.

With the amount of data they have (and they should be keeping track of things) they should be able to run pilots through a filtering system to get a good idea if they are worth looking at.

I mean some people just need to be shown instead of told, at least they have that now ;) I wish more jumped 
---
To add on to my repsonse, I feel making mining more tedious will encourage people to bot more.
---
makes a fairly useful post but bashes all hostile forces against his own lol
---
Not enough to justiy a 5bil difference.

I'm confused... i came here expecting to read about a bot, multiplexer or jita local..and this..this sounds like actual real content.

Nice..Nice work CCP..you've fucked Reddit now.

"BOTS account for 90% of our revenue. In truth, aside from the odd roaming fleet, you're really just like a 90's text based sex line...where you get the feeling you're just interacting with scripts." may or may not have been written by CCp #FakeNews
---
It's not so much that Matterall is pushing a particular message, it's more his guests (RonUSMC, Hedliner, PGL) who do it. If you're a dummy and you don't know what to look for, you might just take everything at face value, but you notice it a bit more if you pay attention to sov null politics. It's okay though, I think it's really just part of the game.
---
It was honestly really only super obvious during Init/Goons eviction of HK, when TiS was part of Imperium News Network. Ironically, TiS split off from INN shortly after all that.

Make Marauders HAW Dreads? Shiieet

I mean 100 frig kills would be what, 300mil at that price? That’s fairly cheap compared to any other exclusive skins.
---
Oh no bbtb2 thinks I'm irrelevant WHATEVER WILL I DO. Also lol it must have been a feat of tactical genius to outnumber your opponents in every fight and not displace any of them.

Sheer genius, Wile E Coyote style

OH how we laughed... "...once you get the cyno on..ummm...you're out of stront to bridge out fyi...."
---
Good times... in truth, it was a bit of sketchy hail mary shot but the team had some fun and walked away with some story time.
---
We support our FC's even with big losses like this one, in the end its a friendly reminder the bigger the ship the bigger the rush. Thats why we log in... that shaky hand feeling you get with "fuck fuck fuck fuck..." so its not bok bok more "fuck fuck fuck" :)
---
Lol, you're wrong. Goons formed the first mega coalition to fight BoB. 
---
30m. Dirt cheap for a cool skin.
---
I keep blacking out and then waking up to dread wrecks..
---
&gt;Where do you start looking? 
---
Active play time. If this shows 150h of ratting (or whatever) in a week, its a ban.
---
&gt;Botting is an easy problem to fix from an ousider's perspective, but try to imagine you're sitting at the desk with the emails and "report bot" tickets in your face and all you want to do is go home and drink the pain away. 
---
Its not really a tech support issue, its an automation issue.
---
Jita local and POS code caused this... true story...honest.
---
CCP should create a bot to identify and report bots. Then create another bot to ban bot accounts. After all bots have been banned, the bots ban themselves. 
---
iirc grath and a few others put him in his place when he was making wild pseudo mathematical claims about damage application. So i guess he’s still salty about being wrong.
---
Imagine being that much of a brainlet 
---
It even lasted longer than his northern deployment.
---
It was pretty timely though
---
yeah it's really good honestly
---
Cap stable bro cap stable

More importantly, groups that are dependent on 1 or a small group of content creators or enables quickly fail when those dudes burn out. 
---
It's filed under the same reasons why cars literally hit a parked police car with lights on... when you're adrenaline is pumping the brain does illogical things at times. 
---
I'm glad he was amped that high in a fight tbh... that's the rush you chase in this game.
---
Jesus fucking christ, if you remove the mining aspect of Rorqs, which is what the guy you replied to talked about, that several billion difference suddenly becomes approx. 700m isk difference. Max Rorq boost is 57, max Orca was what? 40? Thats 17% of difference for measly 700m isk, most of which are insured, and not accounting for the difference in survivability, etc. You dont know what youre talking about.
---
Dark Overlords of Dorkness .. trademark pending

Still not worth it.

You know, this is pretty much spot-on...

a couple of your pilots in cruisers once let me and two or three other frigates go without killing us on undock in calmil in 2016, after i bribed one of your guys with spirits in prostitutes
---
5/5 would trust with honor brawl
---
I feel the words "Security Team" are much more than they appear. I'm gonna go ahead and say its likely at best 1-2 ppl and with the sheer volume of "reports" they are getting ... i feel that by not doubling down on the effort to reduce the queue seems a CCP issue problem not community.
---
"Hey we have really no investment in stopping this behaviour, could you maybe back off on the reports to let our 1-2 guys do their 8hr days pls"
---
"Umm you take my PLEX, fuck off"
---
:D
---
Two shit fit supers isn't the Brave super fleet dude
---
Up until that point we influenced a mass exodus of line members you neglected. Should have paid attention to what we were doing before moving supers, but then again I wouldn’t have expected lesser strategy minds to understand what it was we were doing.
---
Lol @ the outnumber thing, that’s a joke. Also we fought across FOUR of your keepstars, on top of them, where you had tether, and three timers per keepstar, but you are right we totally had the advantage.
---
Right now tapigons dominate the game precisely because they have won the n+1 supercap battle. I don't think it would really change anything at the high level of empire-politics, but it would make room for other gameplay styles to grow again, which would help smaller groups enjoy the game (even if they can't run it).
---
I’m fairly certain that was back in the day when numbers were fairly even. Also PL accepted payment to help Goons right?
---
Have you seen the data dumps of their static data.. god knows how they've shape shifted their actual Data Hub / Warehouse.
---
SOooo many joins.... joins everywhere...sometimes joins that loop on themselves.. i'm so fatigued on the joins..
---
I was going to say something about insta aligning, but then I realized I read that as 500MN, not 50MN. What a waste of a midslot
---
There are soooooo many tools to help automate this process.  they have all the data.... how long you rat, where you rat, how often you type ANYTHING in local, fleet, etc.... do you have chat requests enabled, or disabled, etc... These are all things that could help them narrow down who is suspect and who isn't.  compare that data with who is also getting reported, and also compare that data with who is reporting, and the reporting accuracy.  You can increase your research time.
---
I mean fuck, why not just make a project discovery where we use people to review the data anonymously and find out if someone is botting or not?
---
They're like mice though. Once you cross a system with one of their intelbots all the ratting bots dock up and log off.
---

Well said. Well prepared and attackers forgot FVB
---
Thanks, I will check it
---
This made me laugh. 
---
Don't die. The clouds Will go away. And sunshine Will come.  
---
Alright, thank you for the info, Im going to ask them!
---
rip archon triage, probably one of the best looking caps in the game
---
What is that ?
---
Insurance is kinda a terrible mechanic for capitals i feel. Needs to be reduced or removed completely.
---
The test dread bomb is a bad one to use as an example as that was just terrible from the getgo. But could look at pl/nc dread bomb on to test in the south or goons dread bomb on pl/nc in nalvula or pl on init. If im not mistaken the only dread bomb that has worked was the init/goon bomb on to gotg. And that mainly worked as gotg panicked and dropped all their faxes on to 1 bumped titan.
---
I wouldnt mind seeing a application nerf across the bored for all capitals and supers on to sub but not drastic. Would be nice if a cap/super fleet required a sub fleet to support it to be effective yet still retain the ability to somewhat defend themselves
---
Wrong. It's about weight
---
Lookup Warden. Its a blizzard invention
---
m8 no touching my HAW guns.
---
This already exists between server ticks loading caps take about 10 seconds to land on grid after cyno is lit even in the best circumstances. 
---
This is good.
---
Please clap
---
Nah Bap it’s pretty much a consensus that morons died to this when they jumped when only carriers were called. Also rorq pilot is a moron and didn’t decycle when 40 fucking Loki’s were reported. 
---
I feel like the data transfer is way smaller than what's actually happening on a shard. It would probably also cost a fortune to not only fix up the code, but to get proper servers to handle that.
---
Just paid for 6 months again ( poor person in-game without any alts ) 
---
y'all ready for this hot take marauder buff idea
---
cyno jammer high slot module - consumes stront, 25km radius, requires bastion
---
Sucks but no one cares about your medical bills
---
Lol the goons of that day didn't have money to pay anybody, we helped because of what they did to Kugu
---
Yup. Basically just apply it to the trade hub local channels, where the scam bots spam the most frequently.
---
&gt; people are finally realizing how much worse this system is
---
By "people" I assume you mean Grath Telkin and Malcanis, because everyone else realized this on day 1.

They will just talk with you about things. 
---
You make it seem like he made the honourable decisiom to only use subs and capitals when in actual fact if the shield fleet came north it got not ever engage as it would get wiped out.
---
The only thing that matters in eve anymore for big fights is sheer numbers, saying anything else means you're stupid or seriously lack a basic understanding of eves mechanics
---
Well please next time link your fits when you're dropping on roamers, thanks.
---
So goatbombs next to the road and bomvests and sutch ok time to grab the mrap 
---
Triple capital capacitor booster will laugh at FVBs. You can just cycle the cap booster and shield booster at the same time. Same reason why the Ninazu is so strong, as long as they have cap boosters neuts don't matter.
---
thank you guys for the advice, all I need is a super cap production array to complete this goal.
---
&gt; If anyone is interested, and I highly doubt it. I'll keep updates with the progress to the goal.
---
Is it about the wormholes you asked about not so long ago? Or about your anti-cloaky-camper operation in Moscow whose post I actually upvoted? We are interested, and I think the fine helpful people [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/hotlines) are too, which would be also a good idea to try imo.
---
No.you Cant have benefits anymore because CCP wants more money.   
---
So itt you are rambling about mega-coalitions and how they are bad for the game whilst participating in various mega-coalitions throughout your EVE career?
---
go roam in Catch if you want fights dude, no one cares about your salt
---
&gt; This was a gank not an actual battle
---
there you have it. this doesn't count. moderators pls delete thread
---
*drops supers*
---
*breaks them*
---
feel free to shit on us my brother
---
Tbf we only drop in Impass. Go to Catch and we’ll fight/feed you there. 
---
Wrong. It’s about density 
---
The just need more specific roles for them. Caps, structures, sov, and wars... should all be connected better. Sub-caps need to be more fleet vs fleet oriented. 
---
Imho you are looking to the finger and not to the moon the finger is pointing.
---
Rorqual tremendous tank and invincible?
---
With a bunch of bombers and a couple of command destroyers you can turn an impressive amount of them to ashes... Stuka fleets and bombers bar are the proof.
---
All the complains about capital proliferation and capitals/supers in general are not the problem, they are the direct consequence of the real problem which is: skill injectors/extractors.
---
Let's be honest, injectors NEVER, NEVER, NEVER helped new players, a newbie don't even know on which skill use SP.
---
Injectors were always primary used by experienced players which had a lot of isks (from various sources, botting in past, incredible passive income from moons, gambling, RMT, etc etc...), injectors make it possible to archive in hours/days what in past required a huge amount of time.
---
On the other hand imho rorq mining was an excellent evolution.
---
It gave the opportunity to anyone to develop to industrial/production, also people that don't have a lot of accounts and can't have or don't want many of them.
---
It was also necessary to another very good evolution with moon mining, reducing passive income and going in the right direction: the more you put effort into the game, the more you get from the game. 
---
Hey faxes are known to be op so one should be enough right?
---
First off, it's *really* hard to take you seriously when you instantaneously start flaming by saying silly stuff in your whole second paragraph. Second, I'm gonna assume you're some random highsec pubbie, so I don't think anyone would need to actually change your mind since you probably aren't relevant, no offense.
---
As for crying about running multiple accounts, what you're literally describing is a themepark MMO. You get to ride every ride with your one entry. Eve is a sandbox mmo, where players with initiative and an oppurtunistic outlook will go out of the way to improve their QoL in the game. Just becuase you can't/won't just means you're not going to be able to reap the rewards. 
---
Someone who's working an hourly job and works 4 hours doesn't make the same as the guy who doubles down and works 8. That's life. Either take advantage of it or don't.
---
Honestly, I only log in to drop caps.  Kinda bored of subs.
---
Buffing marauders only makes marauders better, and as has been pointed out elsewhere, they would probably be really annoying really fast (more mjd gameplay, something no-one is asking for).  
---
The issue isn't that there are no subs that can punch up, so much as that capitals are able to punch down to a crazy degree. Appropriate nerfs to capitals improve the viability of all subcaps, including marauders. Making marauders cheaper just makes marauders cheaper.
---
Honestly, kinda. When theres no reason to fly anything else for non-incursion pve, its a problem.
---
Remove insurance on capitals and the system works fine as it is.
---
Reddit default blocks scores for the first hour the post exists to prevent people from negative downvote brigading people just because they can see the comment already has a negative score to begin with. The idea is to encourage people to read the post instead of just looking for downvoted posts to downvote further.
---
Same goes for your Cone/F1ss10n Batphone they would of been there too
---
&gt; e/EVE and post that as the problem with Capitals
---
Is that over on that popular website eddit? 
---
It's actually neither, the cloaky thing was a joke so long ago. the Wormhole was fascinating. I have had a dream of flying -1- specific ship  since I learned it existed. I will crab my balls off to build it. and then my life in eve is complete. With that. so will my life be.
---
10s if your lucky isn't nearly enough, I was thinking more like 30-45s. Long enough that a fleet actually has the chance to react to the cyno ship before it can be used. 10s is barely enough time for most ships to lock and begin shooting.

Yeah the bubbles have a short duration and the warp core strength is why hictors can point. Not fun when a super is very good at just blapping sabres and hictors tho.
---
By the logic you're using a fat person couldn't ever get in shape and lecture other fat people on the damage they're doing to themselves.

YOU DID SOMETHING ONCE SO YOU CAN NEVER CHANGE.

Only I CAN, I CAN start a new Corp, it CAN succeed on it's own, and I most certainly CAN call you a greasy fat ass for the lifestyle you continue to lead.
---
Many have left Horde and said the same.. bring the good ones with you to wherever you go. 
---
I left Horde and encouraged a few peeps from there to come over to Darkness as well. They're thriving and imho were a huge loss to Horde's future... but at the time they were told all the wrong things  about how to act/play in the game.
---
I'm not saying Darkness is the promise land, I am saying that other alliances/coalition runs things much differently and with a lot more respect.
---
I never personally had a run-in with leadership in Horde (other than I cannot stand Steadyo but even then I didn't fight with him). I just felt it was far too toxic to sustain a comfortable play experience despite the friendships forged in general comms.
---
Now the ex-horde boys are leading in a lot of areas within Dead Coalition... so purpose really is spot talent and support them as much as possible.
---
Sounds like you've been "cucked" a couple of times yourself in impass. Am i using this word right? I'm not that familiar with it since I'm not 12.

Ha, and maybe rust storm too to get rid of the items. 
---
Accurate, +1 to Lamaa being full of drunks. Excellent post!
---
Why so many caps and caps so cheap?
---
Because everyone with a rorq can mine one in a couple of day.
---
Why anyone can use a rorq?
---
Because of injectors
---
Why anyone can use caps and super and titans so quickly?
---
Because of injectors.
---
Any problem in the lasts couple of years is related to injectors, think about it. 
---
That lasted long 
---
Why is this thread so toxic? Dude praises the game, and you guys get salty for being guilty of exactly what he's talking about.
---
Confirmed party in Lamaa
---
That's the biggest problem. old supers could kill whatever came to kill them but could barely touch the tackle and subcaps holding them, now they just blap everything and warp off laughing
---
we left syndicate for Stain for a week or two. then joined up with Hero. then with Bl in Venal when hero disbanded. then he went to homestory cup and never cameback to eve... to this day Geemu members still await for senpai to comeback

Thanks.   I knew I had hear or saw it somewhere before,   couldn't remember the author tho.   Hope I at least got the point of the quote across  :)

Lol

nah scorpion peppers... never not scorpion peppers.
---
Did you enroll some 5 year olds to come up with that alliance name?
---
it was a wonderful time never the less
---
Man this is a good idea
---
That test was a joke. Even it was gamed. Having ships to use the entosis link while two fleets play cat and mouse is silly. Gimping your ship to use it to capture sov is bad. All you feel like is a sitting duck waiting for your turn to have your head bonked. It’s like CCP forgot that the group who occupies and uses the space should get the sov. Not who can pink the hardest for a timer.
---
Ok, who put the quarter in the wallybot?

Sorry :D

---
As Warden of The Bleak Lands (I’ve lived here since 1984) I feel I deserve an honourable mention.
---
Although real talk it’s a good breakdown. You’re missing some other groups that are smaller and don’t come out as often:
---
Sahtogas 
---
Carrying Light is a Russian group that lives here, they will literally never leave their system (I’ve never seen them more than a jump out) and are generally hardcore blobbers that just wait around for someone to pass their system. You can bait them out and then they will spaghetti hard. They sometimes drop caps.
---
Aset 
---
A Chinese branch of TNT moved in here lately and if you’re on the right Timezone you can farm them. Quick killboard check shows they’re mostly terrible. Some minmil guys have been farming them.
---
Huola
---
Mackies Raiders are a fairly large minmil group with their main FC Niluso. These guys are the epitome of fight everything, they fly mostly super cheap comps and ram into everything. Some of the most fun people to fight. Will literally never not take the fight. They tend to all go afk when Niluso isn’t there though. 
---
Cruisers Crew
---
They’ve kinda been around town a lot lately, I’m not sure where they live. Sometimes they will fly in small gang comps like cruisers. Mostly butt buddies with shoot first and will drop caps a fair amount. 
---
dont lie eduro  you enjoyed the memes and the fuck ups ..
---
apart from when fuckign atlas didnt stront that r64
---
shit, ajaxamp's site is broken, I'll try to find some other solution for winamp
---
Being logged on and active 23/7 in itself is suspicious, yes (and the same pattern can be looked at for bot accounts in VNIs). But that is easy to work around.
---
But sure if you think you know how to identify them then perhaps contact CCP support or Team Security in case they haven't worked it out.
---
They will patch something to make us feel like they did something. The patch will just be really inconsequential and pointless.
---
No, I'm just showing off my astounding foresight...

If you want honour brawls talk to Schenckt. They’re always up for it and are basically made of pure honour juice.

Irrelivent to all points; even if possible.

Turns out the fight ended with no Losses, so in a Panic, a single sabre pilot self destructed in confusion.

i did not actually

Im so glad this happened to you. because you guys dropped supers on any little thing that moved in Impass. Hope you loose all your caps.

How to read sarcasm 101
---
Well rookie ships dont give killmarks. Use Atrons.
---
That's because they're probably not desperately trying to fill the hole this game leaves 
---
Dreads should get a dps bonus vs supercarriers and titans.  Thats all that needs to happen. Give dreads some teeth again.
---
Good riddance
---
He's talking about unique shiptypes, not what people own.
---
I know this sounds like a bash or troll, but some winmatar pilots are literally the worst I’ve seen in all my eve years.
---
There’s one multiboxer dude I remember fondly who would try cap larges with Apocs and Augorors, it was great.
---
Im with you. but most ppl in this forum are Goons,Test and you won't get anywere.
---
Can't fight back? They rat in supers and carriers but they can't fight back?
---
* Most of the krabs who will rorq mine are in goons
---
* Goons have superior capital forces/numbers = others cant defend their rorqs
---
* Mining is boring for most players = trying to encourage most alliances to become the next krabbing haven is super hard.
---
* Goons will suppress any attempts of other alliances to do the same. Why do you think panfam are not following goons? They tried but it didnt work as they got shit on my goon sigs 23/7.
---
Above four points are the reasons you dont see other alliances hostile to goons following the goon model.
---
ive seen V Xadi outside of sahtogas before but we killed his blob and he didnt come around again, carrying light joined wmtr for a short period for whatever reason too.

Price for that is being unable to keep them stashed. In NPC stations. ~~removekeepstars~~
---
it is known
---
What would be the downsides to giving marauders a native cap warfare resistance?
---
The whole rebalance thing was overblown because they did wind up adding the new promised higgs mod at the same time they changed HICS. CCP always gets quiet around the holidays, there have been announcements from them about the chat issues and their latest ban report so they aren't completely gone they just aren't giving a lot of updates about what they are currently working on. But I wouldn't hold my breath about CCP giving people the ability to give feedback on future changes. Because even when they do ask for it, they routinely ignore it and do what they want anyway.
---
I have 4 rorqs and do a bit of mining. Delete colossal and enormous anoms and you'll see less AFK mining. More rorqs dying due to being spread across a system and region or getting caught changing anoms more often. 
---
I didn't get to watch you eat the last twinkie... downvoted!!!
---
rorqs would still mine alot except now you have something else in the belt
---
&gt;240 dudes with 65 dreads in preformed fleets, ready to go with a plan against 20 retards with shit fit krab supers and carriers and an astonishingly amount of 1 fax.
---
Just saying you cant compare this battle/gank whatever you wanna call it to PGL's attempted dreadbomb against an actual super fleet and then say "haha hehe xd look piggles thats how you gotte do it"
---
Yes, they iterated on it to make it slightly less cancerous. 
---
But it still sucks balls...
---
What is the equation for system cost index?
---
Hard situation to balance.   I think the outcome of most dreadbomb come down to planning and surprise if you trickle in dreads or fax you will likely lose or not trade well.
---
Trying to balance the game when the game tries to unbalance the game to get an advantage they will always face an uphill battle.
---
I personally think booshers have broke the game worse than fax.  The booshing raven doctrine is not engagable and can bounce around grid applying damage. 
---
I think a big issue with the implementation of citadel mechanics is that their weapon systems are all the same for all of them. Wouldn't it make more sense if astras were bonused against for anti-cap roles, forts for anti-subcap roles, and keepstars for both?
---
That way the 'little guy' doesn't get shit on by a single dread, but people who anchor capital structures should be expected to defend them with capital ships. 
---
I hate you for using bright green text
---
So a cyno inhib with more tank for 100x the cost, requiring a dedicated pilot and consumes fuel.
---
&gt; Really, I recognize that SKINs are ~~an isk sink~~ pixel flair mostly for those that can throw isk around for fun.
---
You should reexamine your definition of what an isk sink is.
---
Thats where the Naglfar' s are used to sleep 
---
It's not about being needed. It's the fact that capitals are the worst assets to assault a structure  with right now. We used to have posses and they could be taken out with either a cap fleet or sub caps. It was fine. 
---
Problem right now is that getting close to a fortizar or keepstar with caps is instant death. Especially the latter. Structure shouldn't be defending themselves that easy. And it should be the defending fleet doing most of the work and the structure should have a support role in that. 
---
It's 10km area in 100km range, used like burst projectors - and usefulness is very situational, it can do some amazing stuff like remove logi wing from a fleet, but that's hard to do and require your targets to both not be bad (and be tightly anchored) and be bad (for anchor not to notice the projector and not change direction in 15s spool up time) at the same time. It's just glorified boosh that moves everyone to random spot in a system instead of 100km in straight line.
---
Nothing of value was truly lost 
---
Dread bombing carriers with almost no fax support, yeah that's literally what happens Everytime. Now dread bombing a super fleet is mathematically inefficient and almost guaranteed to fail against a proper fleet.
---
Something else that dies easily

---
This is gold Meeko.
---
while carriers are indeed a bit broken, the other bigger issue is the *proliferation* of caps that allows these groups to swing cap fleets like they would subs
---
aye for sure, but this guy is a clear example of "big toy too soon"  
---
has plenty of ozone, no cyno fit. no smartbombs fit.   
---
jumped instead of bridge &gt; combat fit &gt; didnt shoot a thing &gt; instead tried to slowboat out of bubbled  
---
all the evidence points to complete inexperience, and he just bought himself a pricey lesson
---
With how awful EVE camera controls are (last time I checked you couldn't rotate camera while aiming) it takes quite a bit of practice to do it fast and be consistent. I've seen much more failed burst projector uses than successful ones since they were introduced.
---
Meh. #alreadyreplaced
---
Small and medium structures should be manageable for subcaps (that is, it shouldn't be a massive pain in the ass to fight another fleet on their grid)
---
Sounds likes he's channeling Mittani in his "make CCP bend the knee" phase.
---
Left null to lowsec when carriers were nerfed and scuzzy sov began, it was painful. Did fw for 2 years. Little did I know it was already dead. Stayed in the festering corpse til even it left. Back to null, surprise, it still sucks! Mining is easy and generally risk free, uh... wee? Still sucks. Everyone should go to whs and finally kill this game once and for all.
---
Then they either need an ehp upgrade or the price needs to be even lower, because otherwise a simple Ferox fleet would just alpha them off the field.
---
I think a good compromise would be to give Marauders a resistance bonus instead of the repair boost bonus, and a price around 400m for the hull. Ratters could still use it as before, as the increased resist also means you get about the same rep as before, but on the other hand you can now fit it to something like 300k ehp, so a Ferox fleet cannot just alpha them.
---
That would turn them into a stationary "turret" to control a specific point in space. This usage is currently covered only by dreads, which are however overkill against most smaller fleets. Marauders would then be slightly more mobile than dreads at the cost of significantly less damage, ehp and repair, but then also for a cheaper price. Enemies can simply avoid the covered area (and since the Marauder cannot move while in bastion they could just attack something else in the meantime), or they can bring smaller ships that cannot be easily hit by Marauders.
---
This was a post I made for a suggestion to cynos and supers: 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/9z2921/a_realistic_suggestion_for_gameplay_balance
---
Very tru
---
No supers in wormholes, pal. 
---
Be assured that most of the players don't understand this reddit either
---
good times
---
that would give goons a permanent, insurmountable capital advantage, forever. 
---
Yes, as many have mentioned injectors and rorqs are at the core of the problem.  
---
IMO CCP should do something to inhibit the low effort scalability of them.
---
&gt;To be totally honest i got no clue wtf was happening there precisely.
---
\+1, who were the bad guys? so many entities and stuff happening, but it was a good brawl. GF
---
Also covops blops when
---
Get rid of damage caps allow for reps. If it’s contested you need to control the grid, if it’s uncontested it doesn’t take any time at all.
---
Also remove medium structures.
---
Outrageous weekly anchorage fees charged as ISK sink? So you gotta put taxes on it to pay for it and it has to be well used to be maintainable?
---
remove tether, pos is the way
---
I was talking about the game in general...
---
I get around. I've been places. I don't fuck goons tho.
---
just make a bot reporting bot
---
Yes, kinda. But if you are trying to have a balance discussion, bring facts, back up your argument. Don't just throw out numbers. It hurts your credibility and arguments. 
---
Jackdaw can apply 360dps at 85km or 300dps at 114km. (heated)
---
Hecate is able to deal 490dps at 15-25km, 280dps at 40-80km. Even with 32 tracking score, you are rarely missing at 40km+, even against a frigate.
---
Both of these with 0 ramp up.
---
A while back I would have agreed that its just "nano dorks" complaining and leaving, now I'm seeing wider and wider discontent.
---
&gt; You know, its funny you say that. As I've reading the comments I was thinking to myself that I would gladly give up my titan, 2 supers and dozens of caps if I could get just one good alpha fleet brawl a week. 
---
Seeing a goon and a PL guy agree on this is like unicorn tears.
---
Caps suck for everyone and it's making our universe so very stale. Whether PA go for the short term cashout or long term health of the game approach; well we will see.
---
Can't a rail Hecate serve a similar purpose for half to quarter of the price? Obviously the tracking and dps are less but there is zero ramp time and you're more slippery than some pvp interceptors when bubbles aren't involved.
---
C2/null is the answer. One scan away from a nullsec prime for hunting.
---
Twats getting blobby? Roll away.
---
Nah they need to allow caps to fly through highsec but not allow cynos in HS. of course no supers, burst projectors or Doomsday's either. Battleships need a rebalance, destroyers need a rebalance, several ship classes are missing role bonuses, role bonuses shouldn't be specific to ship class but unique to individual ships.. Modules (especially officer/faction) need rebalancing. There's a lot of work that needs to be done but removing caps all together is ridiculous. You want a new meta? Make one. Get people to fly it. Tweak it for success and it'll spread. 
---
Why cant we all not just be decent and fair people, stop being shady and delete the bots... oh that would be a nice dream, but just a dream
---
are you in skill urself?
---
how did you set this dreadbomb up?
---
very impressive stuff!
---
Guys guys! If I download the everesources.7z file from the website + the installer, Do I get the full game already downloaded? Because the resource is like 10 gbs. Is that the full game in one go?
---
if you made a https://br.inyour.space/ battle report, it would probably look a bit cleaner
---
I had fun gf
---
Rorqual rebalance changed everything in ways ccp didn't anticipate.
---
10/10
---
I agree, and the trouble is with the fickle nature of the meta is that a lot of time time is just because people haven't tried something in a while, rather than it being poor.
---
All too frequently a new meta emerges which requires different counters, and that pulls back other fits in the monthly trend. So, it's very hard to complain about or compare to other games that don't have this kind of complexity or evolving meta
---
Yes
---
Yes. 
---
Hey dude, i am looking for the forum for that new game, krabs online. Is this the right place?
---
This is part of the problem but it's also that their use case has opened up enormously.
---
We used to see enormous slowcat fleets yet it would have been rare in that era to drop an archon on a small gang.
---
Now carriers (and more supers tbh) are just the answer to everything.
---
Unfortunately I think we are too far gone to help with proliferation but we can still limit their use and refine their areas of expertise.
---
Marauders do the same dps as a t1 bs. The only advantage they get is an insane local tank which is completely irrelevant in fleet fights. No matter what they do to marauders you would still rather have a HAW dread. 
---
I will eventually, but the site still has issues loading killmails from Zkill, so it's not accurate at all. Atm [br.inyour.space](https://br.inyour.space) shows 53b vs 13b lost.
---
It's really easy? You just make a bunch of Ravens and insurance fraud them.
---
Is the Astero worth it for alpha WH exploration? Not being able to cloak seems like a big issue, but I'd also love to take advantage of those scan bonuses. I've also been wondering about its combat performance—does the Astero have enough to clear easy sleeper hacking sites?
---
No respect for the stoners in lamaa.  
---
smh
---
Then management needs to provide more tools, strategies, and resources to the issue instead of throwing money at the art team. 
---
Oh finally, I waited for those ships for so long
---
You don't know Legacy very well if you expected more of them than this.
---
It's just so ludicrous that a carrier applies to a snaked A-type malediction with links. Like I'm 1%'ing the shit out of this specifically designed tackle ship and yet near any turbo mongo can force me off in decent time.
---
Us belreev evwyfing Wawwy poasts tuh Weddit. 
---
Why would I ever want a marauder at any price point when I can have a Haw Dread.
---
No wai
---
lol so tru
---
Increase large and xl structure damage caps and hp, nerf all capital (and especially super capital) application to subs, possibly reduce ehp on all caps (or at least supers) by a small amount, further nerf fax reps.
---
Caps remain the same against each other, relatively improve for killing structures compared to subs, are significantly less dangerous to subs, are easier to dread bomb or whittle down with subs... while imo still being fun to fly against subs when properly supported and against other caps too.
---
Who are you? 
---
2 year train time. 
---
The Boson sealed the deal, FU CCP
---
Gottem
---
It was sad to hear one of my high-class wh buddies say that heavy armor is just dead. 
---
Those beautiful battles of attrition, strategy and grit are now just time for capitals to move into range and end the fight.
---
Wait till snuff gets deployed in Lantorn then the party is over
---
I was about to link my youtube channel for PGL, but I see you all already have my footage as evidence :)
---
all we wanted to do is abort the fortizar, suddenly spaceships and explosions. glad to see we still create content for everyone in tyool 2019 :p
---
or you know... make a t2 version of the tier 3 battleships. T2 Abaddon yus pls
---
I approve this message!
---
I was completely during the fight, every 5-10 min a new fleet warped to the battlefield local started from 200 to 700 maybe more.
---
I didn't care if I would lose my ship, I was like "more ships ! more more !"
---
GF everyone.

More evidence that you don't know what you're talking about. How come every thread I read its full of you making things up? Are you a bot?
---
It was put into the game for the benefit of new players that wanted to fly ships in EVE with WASD. Then CCP discovered there were about four such people.

I fondly remember winning WWB without supers. Y'all should try it sometime.
---
Just defang it
---
They said DHSJ was good, this was written by Pred. Do not engage (in local, doesn't respond.) 
---
if you think there are 240 dudes there let me sell you a bridge
---
You realize people use fast ships to try an mitigate some of the damage done by caps.
---
Tell me how well using a brawling ship is going to go...
---
I wouldn’t. An astero is only worth what it is because it can cloak and it can kill all other explo frigates. Flying one without cloak is going to cost you more than it’s worth. 
---
I'm glad you're my leader. Very logical. 
---
If my Fortizar had wheels, holy fuck I would dumpster the astras in system!
---
Word on the street is that NSH is only here to protect you guys. That’s why they left GW
---
So you're telling me that it makes sense to use caps on a **strict** subcap deployment? The key word here being "strict."
---
What was the reported mass before it collapsed?
---
Well tell us about William Crane's Onyxs!

[My bad, 240 characters](https://br.inyour.space/?s=2631&amp;b=8456880&amp;e=90&amp;t=avf)
---
Yeah those two were pretty bad about the stream sniping. 
---
Well sure, but the OP overstating her case doesn't mean that there isn't a legitimate case.
---
As you point out *even T3Ds* (which are supposed to be advanced destroyers; Kiki is faction, i.e. T1) can't compete.
---
The Hecate is the perfect example of the problem here. It can get close to DPS at half the range, or close to the range with half the DPS, and much worse tracking. Sure, you may rarely miss at 40km for tracking, but against a rail hecate, you can spiral in and force the hecate to miss with tracking - not possible with a Triglavian weapon.
---
Rating any of these entities with &gt;3/5 small gang scores is hilarious.
---
Dato and Tikk are  the last remaining small gang warriors apart from solo pilots like Fred Silf and the non derps of APD.
---
You've been pretty generous with your small gang scores. It's pretty easy to look decent when you have a huginn/rapier to let your kitchen sink garbage pile on top of.
---
Looking at Pred and all of DHSJ
---
\&gt;GOTG in Corms (wtf?)
---
PGL isn't exactly someone I would be listening to about balance. Considering he was the one saying machs were shit when machs were pretty much the strongest ant-cit doctrine. He also thinks armor logi should use small reps for faster cycle time.
---
A ridiculously zoomed in Astra. You could only ever notice this of you were looking for it.
---
About the only practical purpose it serves is allowing you to see with high accuracy where your ship is aligned. I've used it for insta-undocking from camped stations.
---
&gt; Can't a rail Hecate serve a similar purpose for half to quarter of the price? 
---
See the thread above - in terms of combat a Hecate is absolutely melted by a Kiki at range, and will suffer tracking problems at the range where its DPS is similar. In terms of mobility and 'non gun related things' a T3D certainly should be better (at least in prop mode) - that's what the tech 3 configurability is about.
---
10s is double most ships aline time
---
Again wormholes are overlooked. Imagine subcaps not working against citadels as op wants.... But in wormholes where you can't bring caps. Yay that'll fix it.
---
I'll check out Sahtogas and Aset, don't think I've had the pleasure (that I remember) I think Mackies are only a couple of active guys atm and find it hard to distinguish them from UNITY.  
---
Bumped into Cruisers Crew a few times, great APMs, unfortunately normally focused on local chat whilst feeding spaceships horribly.
---
As a nomadic alliance, we use dreads/carriers/faxs to deploy to the far reaches of space. We load up the ships with doctrine ships and start jumping. I don't think we've ever ceptored to a deployment location to start fresh. In our language, its implied, otherwise "how would we get the ships there".
---
Team? Isn't it pretty much just Pel and his closet work station at this point?
---
Inb4 "the art team can't do anything but make skins so why not keep making skins?" response.
---
How about heavy fighters can not deal dmg to subcaps, and fighters can not deal dmg to ships under battle cruisers. would solve alot and no need to mess with marruders.
---
Except PL also used said caps to shoot people. It doesn't really count as a subcap only deployment when you're actively engaging with caps. 
---
They're for the most part boring to play, which is the biggest issue. If they'd require some sort of skill at least. Yes, nerf them please, but also make them interesting somehow. 
---
When people bring up capital balance why is there always some dudes trying to suggest some silly changes to a class that has a good role already.
---
The only thing that should change on marauders is adding a 5th high slot to the Kronos.
---
The problem you are having is looking at the peak spool damage. 
---
The inital dps is 215 dps which is lower than everything listed.
---
[Your excuses are cute](https://zkillboard.com/related/30002435/201901161000/)
---
Catch is for gudfites, impass is for getting dunked by caps. Usually the intention is for us to be doing the dunking tho... 
---
&gt; attackers forgot FVB
---
nope
---
He hadn't yet looted a capital sized one.
---
Some say the game balance team is down there
---
How about rebalancing your colour choices first, hot shot.
---
Jokes aside, good points tbh.
---
So backstory is that Old School had been living here, and then Tri moved up here and is trying to take the space, and now French Connection is moving up here and trying to kick errybody out. Pure Blind is basically turning into some hellish no-rules refugee camp for SkillU victims. 
---
French Connection had an Astra and a Fort anchoring, Tri came in with Machs to nope the anchoring structures, with support from Red Alliance in Feroxes. French responded with like 30 dudes in spider repping typhoons that ate absolute shit.  (An example of their fit: [zkill](https://zkillboard.com/kill/74870834/))
---
Old School, who used to own this space, valiantly showed up in a 20 man bomber fleet.
---
NC. showed up in Eagles with PL in Jackdaws to get the Fort killmail, because basically between Init, Snuff, Goons, NC. and PL, Pure Blind is a No Man's Land where nary a Fort shall anchor. I think Init saw NC. formed and rageformed Arty Machs. 
---
This is where it gets a bit complicated. The NC. Eagles and Init Machs were doing the depleted uranium tango while RA and Tri kept the fort paused. Weekend Warriors came in with a Nightmare fleet because they live two jumps away and have a solid, salt-of-the-earth lo-sec belief that everything in space should die, and they brought Iron Armada with them. At the same time, Shadow Cartel came by in Muninns because the more the merrier. Goons came up in a Jackdaw fleet because they saw things happening, and brawling is way more interesting than clearing the ochre out of the belts. GOTG came by in Cormorants because they saw things happening too, but they can't afford Jackdaws.
---
As you say, Init escalated with carriers and some pretty nice Fax Machines ([zkill](https://zkillboard.com/kill/74872285/)). NC. counterdropped with supers and titans, who proceeded to do what supers and titans do to carriers, fax and battleships.
---
Interestingly, Snuff titans had been starting to move around in Rakapas. I think they decided not to get in on things when they saw the NC. supers and titans. I'm somewhat surprised that given the number of blocs on field and the amount of ti-di holding the NC. supers on field, no one wanted to counter drop, but who knows.
---
Init took the worst of it, the fort died, GFs were had by all. 
---
Thanks guys, see you all next week for the next anchoring PB fort...
---
We got intel loads of people were in the system and decided to have a look with some corms, we had no idea what the fight was about so we just went to see if we could snag a few kills. Was pretty fun evading those jackdaw fleets :)
---
Remove insurance outside of high sec (and now that war decs are changed, remove insurance from war kills too)
---
There, I just pushed the Ferox and caps in the right direction.  
---
I'm just throwing this out there (not terribly sure it would be a good idea) but what if the mauraders had a AoE fighter point defense?
---
Clearly it'd need a lot of balance so you can't just Marauder firewall against carriers/supers... or not?
---
Even in hindsight I wouldn’t have wanted to have spend my first several months in Eve any other way. Nobody really knew what they were doing (even if they acted like it) and pretty much everyone was willing to throw ships away trying to learn or just for the fun of it. Some of the shit we did was the most fun I’ve had in any multiplayer game. 
---
I imagine those who use capitals represent a large portion of their income. That level of investment means those players are more willing than most to keep a sub -- if not by buying it themselves, then by keeping demand up in the markets.
---
CCP is a company. The priority is profit, not game balance or playability.
---
We're wet and ready &lt;3
---
woah, be nice :)
---
I'm in TEST and give up votes and good posts all the time. I'm sorry you feel that way, not everyone can have 10k friends.
---
For real though this post is dumb the player base jerks in a rotating circle. This guy wants Ishtars but a few years ago it was "reeee everything is Ishtars" so they got nerfed. Then everything was "reee Petes" and they got nerfed. This is just the current reee. Eve's player base is an ever evolving circle jerk rotating on itself. It's like one of those cool perpetual motion machines but way stickier. CCP could nerf every capital in the game and the next post would be about how Munnins or some shit.
---
But if you need more friends I'll be your friend. Just don't expect to get anywhere unless you buy me some drinks. Or capitals. I need more caps, caps are the most important part of Eve.
