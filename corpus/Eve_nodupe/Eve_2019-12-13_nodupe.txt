You do lose stuff in wormholes. All the stuff. Don't quite care about high- or null- sec whinebabies.

As stated earlier, how easy it is to access makes me wonder if CCP is taking advantage of people who can't spend their money right. At the end of the day it's more of a moral issue and something that would be sorted through courts, but is this even CCP making hypernet? 
---

---
It takes less than 10 clicks to bid on an item. I agree having a good UI is good for a feature, but not even a confirmation window? Not even some warning? They put in that much effort for Hypernet but never do anything for other features that need a better UI? ACLs could be waaaaaaay better. Structure management could also use a better UI. Yet somehow, they can easily make a good UI to make people spend more isk/plex? Maybe you don't see an issue with that, I certianly feel that CCP is simply ignoring the eleplants in the room.
---
You too can materialize more a dozen pre prepped nerds to vaporise your foes with this miraculous module i'm sure you've never heard of it called a Cynosural Field, only works outside of wh space tho.
---
I run a corp like that :) 
---
Nooot quite sure I'd be fine with having someone's structures in my home hole (though if you join, we can set up a citadel that you have rights to) but other than that, we can discuss it if you're interested.
---
I don’t know why but I spent weeks with paper dolls in spaceships, even more useless than Skyrim’s version
---
but ... why buy a skin that was given free ? For an ugly vexor nonetheless
---
It's a derogatory term. Krabs are players that bemoan the blue doughnut of null sec while at the same time engaging in all the risk adverse behaviors that sustain said blue donuts.
---
Fighting stupidly outnumbered is one of the most honorable things you can do in this game! Too many people get upset and quit when they see a challenge. Good to see Mcav still around kicking ass and getting good fights.
---
That's not accurate these tactics are they only type that work against goons and test right now... Check out voltas kill board last weekend they went for goons supers under the umbrella and took down 2 in the space of an hour. WH's are the leveler it dosnt matter who you are big or small 80 polarised bombers are going to wreck you and the umbrella ain't gonna save ya.
---
There's a couple week old threads on here about the same thing and I myself put in a support ticket for it. A mass support email went out to those who put in a ticket for the same issue that basically said they were having an issue with a link flapping (unstable connection cause by, in my experience, a bad or dirty cable, bad optics, or a bad port) on an edge router. They disabled that port or link and re-routed the connection which seemed to fix it for a little while then posts like yours started showing up again.
---
Put in a tech support ticket describing your problem and if you want to possibly help them out with narrowing down the issue, give them your geographic location and what ISP your using. They'll get back to you.
---
I've been trying to download the game but it's been stuck on Installing for 3 days. Every few minutes it downloads a few wine files but I can't see the progress of the download.
---
Thanks, ill do that.
---
yes
---
da way
---
these and personal wallet divisions are my top 3
---
yaw eht si sihT
---
It's gone now. Gallente savages have reoccupied half our planet.
---
What are the consequences for an expired hyper net offer?  I have no idea how this shit works.
---
except dessert isn't some kind of irrelevant exuberance. it's just food, you have to eat.
---
Yeaaahhhh, not even sure what to say this event
---
nothing is stopping them being as common as they were, except maybe a halving in the total population of the game.
---
Is there anyway to see what the least flown ships in the game are? I can see the top ten ships on zkill: sabre, loki stiletto etc but I can't seem to find a longer list.
---
They over priced it, their greedy fuckers, all the shit they are raffling is double what it should be, I'm enjoying watching them all fail one by one
---
:(
---
Wow...I understood most of what you said and it was great. Every time I try to go to low sec I get killed. Also my cloaking is at 2, moving on to 3. I have a navy comet and I really enjoy the wh though again I keep dying. Every corp I end up in, is about one or two people which is why since I started with eve I've changed corps 5 times and so my history stinks. I do like to take every step you just mentioned but the "how" is slightly tricky. But I'm grateful for your help.
---
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^.
---
Gherti, on the behalf of all of us please stop calling it that.
---
Yes. I applied in game, I'll check out the website, thanks.....but I wonder, even though I may not be the biggest fan of pvp, I might wanna try it sometimes, is it true that pvp is completely banned in signal cartel? What do they do for fun?
---
u know i can't xD
---
blue-a-fleet
---
Appreciate that. I'll keep that in mind.
---
I don't think "organizations are the problem". I think Eve mechanics determining the capabilities of organizations are. Such as anomaly respawns, cyno mechanics and so on (by the way we came a long way last year to addressing these). I don't point at Goons and say "look these people are the problem" like many of you imagine.
---
The reason why I stress expertise so much is you really need to witness nullsec ecosystems' development since
---
Explo

Yeah u can snowball CCP. I'm about to board a flight to iceland rn, better give me my damn yeet filament

Didnt see it In the playstore
---
Uhh IOS.. I thought it was in Good tho too.. not sure.
---
Shit.... see my other post... IOS
---
Outsourced to whatever that Chinese company is that makes a million mobile games. It honestly makes an amazing first impression - it's Eve on the phone! It works! But it doesn't take long playing it to see that it's Eve dumbed down to the point of being kinda boring. That said, it's only the beta, and if they actually add exploration I'll play it at work without a doubt.
---
Karmafleet is a Corporation in the Goonswarm Alliance.  The Goonswarm Alliance is part of the Imperium Coalition.  All this controls a few big areas in nullsec.
---
We have many enemies and consider everyone who isn’t “blue” (friendly in our coalition) a target.  We are hated by many but it’s all about perspective.  I used to fear Goonswarm and a few other big alliances.  Then one day I wondered what it was all about and wanted to do “big fleets” so joined since I figure why not join with the group I’ve heard so much about.  Oddly it’s by far the best group of people I’ve been with.  We have tons of fun with lots of learning opportunities.   Karmafleet taught me to get over my fear of loosing ships, to just getting out there and having fun and actually doing things.
---
meanwhile my shit raffling for 110% isn't selling. wonder what i'm doing wrong...
---
if you wanted to buy sp you could, this changes nothing.
---
How is that remotely possible?!?!
---
Someone who taught Menger, perhaps. Noone including myself has heard of Syrus, and he certainly wasn't influential to the economics profession as Menger and other Austrians were in coming up with marginal price theory and subjective value theory.
---
i bet most of the shit you raffle is actually useful, though.
---
the RSI isn't, it's just a hangar ornament.
---
I applaud your goals but not the method. These things are simply not vulnerable to anything other than titans/supers en mass which to me is a greater problem than their versatility. To fix this the ehp bonus should be adjusted down in addition to the fax absolute rep power and/or the fax diminishing return equation. The ehp should be adjusted down with dd dmg so as to not change that equation.
---
smaller screen
---
I used multiple monitors and accounts.  Dont know what you're talking about, so no.
---
r/echoes
---
Download it and see.
---
There is even less transparency as to what you're looking at or what is happening.
---
Are you serious or /s ?
---
None of these arguments make sense. The only time dreads work is a solo idiot gank or complete surprise gank on dumb poorly fc'ed home defense fleets. Dreads / Carriers are utterly useless in actual capital fleet combats as a single fax negates 3 dreads or 10 carrier.
---
Just realized the topic sounds like adding features to Echoes, I wanted to see what peoples opinions where on features to add from Echoes back into the PC version of the game.
---
Ah, I see.
---
Yes, but you're not *forced* to. Addiction is an explanation for your behaviour, not an excuse. If you have a disorder that makes you vulnerable to abusing something then it is your responsibility to remove yourself from that thing, not everyone else's responsibility to prevent your exposure to that thing.
---
And CCP knows that, which is why they offer to deactivate the feature on any and all accounts you may have if you submit a ticket.
---
Addiction doesn't mean you can't avoid self-destructive behaviour. It makes it harder to avoid, but not impossible.
---
I don't know if Echoes has this but a little camera in the corner of your screen showing you the target view might be nice.
---
That is not how it works. The number or hypercores you need depends on the combined price of the hypernodes not just their number. It's more in the range of 200 billion isk in plex.
---
well then there is no problem and we are both complaining for nothing
---
312
---
Oh god the mouth movements on that CONCORD talking head.
---
i prefer managing the actual gameplay - shooting spaceships, not trying to manage people to have them manage spaceships
---
For what it's worth, when I was checking it out on Singularity a few days *before* the event kicked off, that holo strip thing wasn't there at all.
---
To be honest, i cant wait to test them out with my buddies. Just take some ships and go for it.
---
No one will know who it is :) I will call it [NotIWantISK.com](https://NotIWantISK.com) :)
---
Allegedly they've already declined a buy offer for 2 tril so risking losing the ship to get 1tril compared to losing 200b in hypercores doesn't make sense.
---
And missile Catalyst II
---
I don't understand who they though would buy it. People don't just have billions of isk to throw away on a 1/512 chance EACH. I mean technically a few people apparently do, but who was expecting all 512 to sell?
---
There is no disconnect.
---
You want every faction ship in the game for your ship collection?
---
Here's your chance at the low-low price of only 1 million ISK per ship. All you gotta do is buy hypernode tickets and hope to win.
---
So addicts will throw all their ISK into every hypernode trade for the chance to win, and when they run out of ISK then what?
---
No problems! Buy PLEX for real money, sell PLEX in-game and now you have MORE ISK to throw at the hypernodes!
---
As far as I am concerned there is direct line between real money spent to obtain ISK and ISK spent on hypernodes, thus you have real money being spent with the intention of using it on lotteries in-game. This is blatantly obvious, and if someone has a gambling addiction they struggle with this is absolutely an issue.
---
&gt;If you have another idea about it ,[sic!] suggest us.[sic!]
---
He implicitly just suggested that frigates should be able to fit warp drisruptors. :facepalm:
---
If you feel they fuck with you too often, join the Test spy organisation and fuck them back. Everyone gets fucked, everyone is happy!
---
Yep, this Hypercrap garbage with a short 3 day auction limit, mixed with a shittastic UI that seems to just show things at random, adds a significant cost to set up auctions that there' a good chance will not finish.   Add in no promos, and this entire gambling shitfest is vastly inferior to the old player run versions and will likely fail hard once the novelty wears off.  Of course the poor gambling addicts will still use it, though.
---
Any ship is what you decide it to be. AT ships are also hangar ornaments for some and PvP ships for others (even if it's lol mimir). Depends on your wallet and balls, I guess. If you can afford to undock and have some fun in RSI before it gets blown up - why not?
---
Well, you got the most important thing right. Not Goons.
---
[removed]
---
... EvE has sound?
---
yes.
---
the cores are based on the raffle value (ticket price * number of tickets) not the item value.
---
might be how people have filters set up.
---
i ignore anything with 512 tickets, i feel they are just scams using the high volume of tickets to spread the price so they can look "cheap" while still being an absurd markup.
---
I was expecting it to be a bit closer to Eve. More in relation to ship fitting.
---
I actually quite like the combat and the auto aggressing the next target.
---
It's missing huge chunks atm, like corps and easily finding module/ship info, but that stuff should come before the full release.
---
u couldve just left friend
---
Clearly this raises the value of the ship by 300B isk since they rejected a 4T offer. According to goo*cough* test logic.
---
Eve is designed to be harsh and it should let people jump straight into PvP if they want to.
---
But more people will spend money if it's restricted to begin with.
---
Thank you for that lesson :).
---
I'm guessing it was changed because of their plans to do downtime less often - without downtime, they need another trigger to start the new challenge.
---
As well you should; Could you imagine how unfair it would be if Hong Kong got freedom while the rest of us are still living under corporate kleptocracy and corruption?
---
I only use the fleet channel and one channel that merges all my alts vOv

Oh yeah I got a filament. Had to redeem it.

Oh so you don't always get SP?  Now I know.
---
Olive is 10th but ccp does not brought into game yet
---
No, we're not going to get chased off grid by a bunch of pansies who can't fight. We're going to get what kills we can and have a good time besides.
---
Wow! This game is something else then. But should I play? I mean I have school and the membership is kinda expensive.
---
Idk what happened to my normal font
---
lol wat
---
Yeah, because that's common. Get your head out of your ass.
---
So what are the uses for those ships I can only play for the first three days?
---
High angle weapons
---
U literally fed like 10 ships lol..
---
They allow you and friends to teleport to random nulsec systems
---
Yeah he kicked himself for it after the fight. We multibox heavily when we need to pad our numbers against big foes. He was the hic and the leshak and was struggling to keep up.
---
I like that the fight could have gone better if we did better. It gives us something to work towards. 
---
Sometimes we just get royally spanked by a wormhole blob.
---
The Dread KMs I’ve been on say otherwise.
---
OK thanks for this. I'll try to test it and see if it works. I should probably record a video of it or something if I submit a bug report.
---
Yeah, Dscan. Sometimes it happens, sometimes not. Someone else said it might have to do with hotkeys.
---
No, but going to look at hotkeys.
---
It's the same as any other NEX items: players can resell them for ISK after buying them from CCP. But either way, to create those datacores ~58K PLEX had to be removed from the game (and CCP's accounting books).
---
What the hell man I thought everyone in EVE was rich after the rorqual/supers spree. Kick PGL from game, first he promised as the million dollar battle and then this... With this rate of failing CCP will offer him a job soon :(
---
no
---
Its CCP’s way making Jita scams legal, also they are getting paid through it 
---
I have done 100 raffles of different items and mostly you see seller winning the raffle or person who has majority to tickets 
---
In my opinion just save isk and buy the item of the market/contract at least you will know that in the end you are getting the item
---
Nothing to add to this reply except "Upvoted".

so sad, i’ve been so eager to get into bombing but even the basic bombing fit is still a week away from training. o7 wish i could fly with you all.

as long as you can sit in the hull you can come for this one. Even an astero would do, since you'd be able to take a black ops bridge! The fleets tomorrow wont be too serious, just come and hang out with us! The 16:00 campfire part is mostly talking and drinking anyway!
---
Haha fair enough, I can respect that.
---
Might matter that I said it in Chinese also lmao 光復香港
---
Sounds right to me =)
---
not being able to use the bomber was the main reason, but i can’t come for other reasons (part of it is that it takes place 2am in my timezone) now i’ll be even more sore for it :P either way, hope you guys have fun out there.
---
I dont get it please explain where my mistake is: 
---
As Omega I will get a 400k SP box (along with a bunch of other boxes with 50k SP). If I sell the box to endgame characters this box alone should be valued AT LEAST at 3 Injectors (150k each atm for most my toons). So with all the other boxes we are looking at 3-4b+ if I take into account prices dropping? Current prices with all the 50k Boxes it would be 5b?  
---
The plex needed to pay for 1 month of omega I can buy on the market for around 2b.   
---
So couldnt I make an endless amount of new toons, plex all of them and turn a profit on each both on isk and SP, while skilling an endless amount of toons for 1 month for free, while gaining an endless amount of "you recruited a friend and he went omega" gifts on my main?   
---
I am confused?...
---
people saying it is good it will drop injector prices.  
---
To make this stuff a no gain no loss think injector prices would have to drop by around 50%? And then it would still be free skilltime and recruiting rewards in an unlimited amount?!  
---
And IF skillinjectors drop even further and too far we get to the point where I can get skillinjector for a few 100 mio and I can superrat for an afternoon and inject a new rorq toon?! How is this healthy in any way?
---
What TZ are you? My corp does a lot of blopsing as well, and ours tend to go out around 0300 eve time.
---
Your first point just makes it easier for large groups to poop on small groups. If you already cannot form a defense fleet in a slightly off TZ this makes it worse. If a large group with 2/3 very active TZs wants to kill you it’s easier. Defender sets the base timer but the RNG hurts them if it rolls unfavorably. It also makes the whole thing more tedious logistically for the attacker.
---
Why is your tabbing so excessive, or is it only me?

BECAUSE YOU DON'T UNDOCK IF YOU SEE ME IN LOCAL OTHERWISE

Yeah thats the direct manual input, you should allways use this!

Problem is jetzt to do bombruns for example if your fighters are 100km out and you need to estimate the angels between them and their targets.

Need those extra oracles to break most corps risk adverse 1/1 dps/logi fleets

Copy and paste from a forum post. Apologies.

Cost of item + fees + cost of nodes you buy yourself.

imp navy energized adaptive nano membrane or cheapest faction ones on market.
---
Don't use three batteries switch one or two for a cap recharger. First the ewar resist has a stacking penalty I'm pretty sure. Second more total cap is useless if it takes you an hour to recharge.. Three if neuts do get on you. And they will. If you don't have the recharge to counter it  again doesn't matter how much total cap you have.
---
As another said bling the rep is a good start. I forget off hand which one is good for cap but just compare the c type reps and you'll figure it out.
---
I use to run them with a vindy and 2 nestors with a similar fit. I don't really think it gets better besides throwing more isk at it. I heard a proteus does pretty well but it's skill intensive.
---
But it's not a net negative activity. The money spent gives them enjoyment. Just like if you spend money on a concert ticket and enjoy the concert. That money paid for enjoyment which had value.
---
What you’ve just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever ~~heard~~ read.

All of the people that cannot calculate EV are losing their Isk and the dumb money is running out quickly.

no, it doesn't.

you don't magically get extra shit for not using implants - that's why you use implants in the first place.

You realize that the odds don’t change merely because the seller can buy their own tickets?  You are paying for a chance to win. For instance you spend 10 mil to buy a 1 in 512 chance to win a billion isk item. The odds don’t change just because the seller buys up every other ticket - you still have a 1 in 512 chance. Many folk take these types of chances everyday playing lotto. It’s no big scam. You don’t want to gamble just don’t play.  If you aren’t happy with a 1 in 512 odds buy more tickets and increase your personal chance of success.
---
He basically lost an AT ship worth of nodes. Link killmail plz
---
You must have missed the excessive ping abuse advertising his own twitch stream after having other members of test set up his twitch stream for him. Now he's been away from the game for a half a year, comes back to come up with a third party service by stealing someone else's name and continue to be unoriginal in an attempt to keep himself relevant In the game. I'll make sure to secret santa you all knee pads this year.

I love fucking war
---
I'm sorry, are you *seriously* contending that NC is the pro-botting alliance in that war?
---
lol
---
make it 60 jumps
---
No, when you lose them you make all the raffle ticket isk back that covers the cost of the item, the taxes and hypercube.
---
Then you just relist and keep doing that until you inevitably win.
---
I see what you did there
---
Exercising your free trade in a social and entertaining environment!

We absolutely do not...

who takes the hit on that 200bil?

Whoever posted it

&gt;though our lack of logi means I lose more than I should.
---
You're saying that you're in horde closing in on a year so I'm going to assume you're new. Get this idea out of your head. You absolutely do not need logi to keep your ships alive. 
---
Also dont think about losing sabres and ceptors. It's way better to think of them in the same terms as ammo. You dont say you wasted nova rapid lights or Aurora S when you kill stuff do you? They're there to get and keep content alive and die if they must to keep the fight going

hi all, i'm a wealthy collector of eve ships with a hankering for some gambling.  i've got about 2.5t of isk i want to blow today, can anyone suggest something i might gamble on?
---
&gt;Cant help it... I dont see the BLINK logo
---
???
---
look at this dude
---
&gt;I just yolo'ed my Nyx on the top of 20 man rupture fleet, killed 2 of them, rest of them bailed. Whole Rupture fleet was worth 700mil. While my Nyx is woth 20bil which is 28 times more. Do I deserve to to be able to drop on them that gang an annihilate them? Oh f\*ck indeed I should!! I made my effort and invested decent amount of isk to be able to do that! Would I yolo the same Nyx on a 20 man Legion fleet with logi support? perhaps not, because that's 20 man who made some effort too, and that gang is worth pretty much the same amount of isk as my Nyx is.
---
The problem is that you're able to deploy an asset this powerful, capable of completely wiping out an otherwise solid smallgang, without any support whatsoever. Supercapitals are fleet killers, and they by and large have killed the smallgang meta, forcing people who want content to blob up so they can pose an actual threat. You shouldn't be able to just drop a single ship and obliterate an entire fleet, that is massively overpowered.
---
&gt;My Erebus just popped some frigs on gate who could not keep the right transversal . Oh wait that's unfair. How come 4000 times isk worth more ship is able to do that? Because he made and EFFORT and bought it. But wait my Erebus got tackled ratting and they dropped 10 dreads on me. God damn how come 1.5 cheaper gang is able to pop such an expensive ship? That is not right. We should nerf anticap dreads.

Personally, my ideal EVE atm would be Panfam, Imperium, and Legacy being enemies.  I think you need at least three groups at odds to make things interesting.  
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
More is better but when CCP figures out how to force that EVE is saved so idk.
---
We can't leak information we don't know ourselves.
---
If you remove the "blob" you will remove any hope to erased supercapital fleets, right now supers and titan are dying, time to time, but it will never impact Mineral Economy or Nullsec politics, if tomorrow you dread bomb few titan from goons, yeah you will have some reddit karma but that's it but if tomorrow You do a supercap/titan brawl  you erased goons superfleet delve won't be the same, goons won't be the same, nullsec will change, sov will change, economy will change, you get the point.
---
For me it's the other way around, yeah solo pvp with titan/super is funny but it doesn't do anything good for eve, you hurt small/medium size gang, you hurt economy by making space super safe with umbrella. EVE have way to much way of making super/titan but less way to killing them, CCP should encourage B-R to reset titan/super number

Hey can you it up again? I might wanna give this a try.
