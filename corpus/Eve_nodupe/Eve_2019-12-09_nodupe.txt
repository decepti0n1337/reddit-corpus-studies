don't stay in highsec.

Jesus Christ it took the ad instead of the video lmao

---
I see, but what about the rest of what I wrote, is there any sense in it?
---
Cant see your locked targets what a shitter
---
Something that really intrigues me is the idea of flying through lowsec with the express purpose of baiting a ganker into attacking me thinking I am a weak target, and then surprising them with a formidable battle. I don't have anything against gankers, but the surprise would be fun. I have heard of the famed Battle Procurer. But are there any other nasty little surprise ships that anyone has had success in this area with?
---
Well, how much Community-Managers they got left that could inform us?
---
So with the vast amounts of context you gave us. I think the best explanation is: 
---
"You must be located in a station to use this service"
---
Quit while you're behind.
---
Idk that might be wrong, just heard it long ago
---
That would be why it was banned, those services are disallowed
---
Oh sweet score
---
If you use Google stadia or GeForce now it's against the terms of service so they can ban you, I lost an alpha to it a while back without knowing.
---
Out of curiosity; Reddit App? Did you open the link through the app? What kind of phone do you have? Iâ€™m just trying to narrow down whatâ€™s causing the potato res on my end.
---
Yes indeed it was a rail fit.... I've found that to be preferable to blasters in pve, if that doesn't hold up in PvP at this ship size that would make sense
---
Go away! ðŸ˜„
---
nah, there are a bunch of fanboys here- it's just recently CCP has fucked up so bad that most of them are more bitter
---
The one's in Goons are nice.
---
The typical mindset in general is, make as much isk as you can, gank as many players as you can and steal their shit. Russians have long memories and long grudges. You are either a friend or an enemy and if you are neither, you are someone to gank. It's not really that hard to understand. They also a relentless once they have their mind on something. They will go out of their way and wait outside a station all night, to gank someone they've set their mind on to gank. The ganking culture comes from their black humour, laughing at someone else's misery, etc. It really plays into that mindset.
---
Because of their mindset about making as much isk as possible, they gravitate to high earnings activities like incursions, burner missions, wormholes, etc. There are different Russian alliances and coalitions. Befriend one lot and the other lot become your worst enemies.
---
The russian groups doing the mission running in npc space, actually control a lot of the implant market in Jita. We goons tend to be their friendly competition, even if Black Legion and Pandemic Horde are trying to muscle in on the action.
---
I get this EXACT same issue. So happy to hear itâ€™s not just me. Iâ€™m in America btw
---
 any good fw corps that are okay with newbies (to fw, not eve)
---
Gigx is that you? ;)
---
f
---
I apologize for sounding rude, but what?
---
&gt;any tips and advice
---
learn to use google.
---
this is both serious and sarcastic in equal measure.
---
[deleted]
---
Sorry, my fault. Pandemic Horde is a newbie friendly corp.
---
Google translation is getting better, even if it isn't quite there yet.
---
I think your IP or MAC address is evil. Very evil. Like one that used to RMT bad. But I'm sure, some random guy just starting Eve would find it strange and post here.
---
Not really. SoCT ships require combined arms (guns and drones) for their true damage potential, and the Sunesis is no different. Drone damage is not affected by C13WR effects, and therefore wouldn't make up for its incredibly gimped DPS.
---
The Sunesis is a terrible ship for anything that doesn't involve being a Jita taxi. 
---
- It's gimped by only having three guns as opposed to seven or eight on other T1 destroyers (T3s make up for their lack of guns with Sharpshooter Mode and two damage bonuses).
---
- It has a very small drone bandwidth, which gimps it when compared to the other drone boats of its class (Dragoon, Algos).
---
- It doesn't get a range bonus like other destroyers.
---
- The larger number of mid/low slots can help make it hardier than your average "all gank no tank" destroyer, but it is again gimped by small health pools.
---
- It's slower than most destroyers. Slower target means it's easier to hit.
---
- That extra space in the cargo hold gets eaten up fast with the other crap you need to stay out and about. Mobile Depot, extra drones, ammo, extra fits, etc.
---
The damned thing is basically an obese frigate with a luggage rack. You will have better luck with the Gnosis or Praxis, and I'd recommend training into stuff for those.
---
The other guy  [u/p00py246](https://www.reddit.com/user/p00py246/)  was banned roughly in this same time, under this he newbro and only created  character. Having read comments of both of you it became clear that you are connected by one small detail. ***The use of cloud services for the game***.  Apparently this was the reason for the ban. Someone decided to use cloud services as a bot-farm platform. In its time also banned free VPN services.
---
Thanks, I should do research but I've never done that outside of school lol.
---
*Cynabal/Gila/Nomen/Osprey Navy/Orthrus/Nano cruiser. + backpack alt (command dessy) / hyperspatial pvp Covertops / Dictor alt
---
*Kikimora/Confessor/Jackdaw + alts i mentioned above
---
*Nano Assault Frigate (Wolf/Retribution) + Stealth Bomber (tech 2 torps)
---
gonna try get through some of these points quick, and I don't know if they'll help but
---
1. new player experience and tutorial agents aren't really representative of the game as a whole, they just kind of get you to interact with the basics of eve, give some beginner rewards, ships, etc (edit: press f12 for tutorial agents... they're =/= lvl 1, 2, etc as I believe someone else pointed out)
---
2. skill training is what gets you into new ships ( alt-x, skills, show all skills). Look at a frigate in the ship tree, for example, every level you train into amarr frigates, you get 7.5% weapon disruptor effectiveness and 10% optimal range (total 37.5% and 50% respectively) for the crucifier for example [https://prnt.sc/q84uqz](https://prnt.sc/q84uqz)
---
3. level 4 in many skills is usually pretty good till you figure out what you want to do
---
4. simulating a fit in game is to make a template to theory craft/fit/minmax etc, you still need to buy those things and fit the ship, places like jita 4-4 are common trade hubs where you can pretty much find everything you need with one click
---
5. highsec is 1.0 to 0.5 and ties into concord response time, people may freely engage anyone anywhere in eve with a range of consequences... A common tactic in highsec is kill someone in a small cheap ship that deals more damage than the target can tank before concord rocks up to blap them, they do this because they're potentially spending 5m isk and they're killing 100m worth of stuff really fast, and probably making a profit doing it, or just doing it before they can... nowhere is safe, it's just how much you're aware of what's going on that determines how safe you can be
---
lowsec is 0.4 to 0.1 and sentry turrets on gates and station is the only policing that is done.
---
nullsec is 0.0 and lower, into the negatives, and this is sovereignty owned space where the rules are made up and the points don't matter.
---
dunno if any of this information is relevant, but at the end of the day, there will be a fair bit of leg work on your part required to get enjoyment out of eve, but if you stick to it and find what you enjoy, it will be rewarding... (also, not to throw shade, but I'm not sure if you're talking about eso: morrowind, or es3: morrowind, and not sure if you didn't like the language? or couldn't figure out how to do a quest in the game, if it's the latter, then eve is probably not for you)
---
I am actually not the funniest one....or the sly-est...or even very good.  I am actually pretty shit by Eve standards but I have a green killboard!
---
Always recommend Eve-U.  He/She will land there eventually.
---
check on youtube worstplayerever
---
since artys got boosted, i'd say tempest
---
I have that reflexes of a dead animal so I understand.
---
Yup. I lost a Gila in the abyss today due to it. Itâ€™s a little rarer for me though. Only happens one or twice a day at the most.
---
Funny, funny.
---
I got advertised one corp, called the Emperor's Medical Corp. It gave me money, disabled taxes, and told me to enjoy.
---
Good corp.
---
I know what "condensation" is literally. I do not understand what meaning you put in this word applies to this situation.
---
Statistics on retention players that you saw on one of fanfest was a bit not true. They had some problems with abuse referral program. With the help of the referral program, it was possible to buy plexes cheaper than buying them directly, so people created a large number of new accounts to take advantage of this.  
---
I think when you start playing EVE it's a game about exploring the game itself. That the coming person should be interested to learn and discover the features for himself. The first time you deal with the game yourself if you are interested. over time, you learn more and more. also EVE is a game about social interaction, a newcomer can always learn advice from experienced players.
---
Nah you didn't read the patch notes? They use Space Flash bangs now. On a serious note this is most probably a shader issue try repairing your install and post processing settings.
---
Can you run combat signatures(the ones you dont need to scan down) as a fleet?
---
If yes:  
---
How is the loot distributed? 
---
else if:  
---
What ships do you recomend to run nullsec angels sites?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Thanks!
---
Also how does one manage the salvage part?  
---
You fit salvagers into the ship you using? or use alts?
---
In another thread here o  reddit it was concluded that a new account wad banned almost right away due to using geforce streaming services.
---
I'll try disabling ipv6. As for packet loss and/or network issues, I don't have any for the time being except with eve.
---
These dcs only started now. I've never lost connection in eve like this.
---
Everything else works fine. I tried playing world of tanks and world of ships - both NA and it worked fine. 
---
My isp is the one providing the backbone for the entire country. It'd be noticeable if we had isp-wide issues. 
---
Thanks for the heads up though.
---
Thank you o/
---
You don't appear to be doing the Career agent missions that the tutorial intended to guide you to. Suntendi Recall and Vitoc Vector aren't part of the tutorial. 
---
If you want the free stuff and more tutorial then go do the beginner career agents https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Career_Agents
---
The military career and advanced military career will give you combat ships and weapons
---
eve russian community is big enough, so you can live inside of it without external communication.
---
additionally there is time difference : russians from far east will more likely communicate with US west timezone players, russians from europe will more likely communicate with europeans.
---
Can you light a regular cyno and a covert cyno at the same time on a recon?
---
I have an outstanding contract on one account from a toon of mine I biomassed and I can't delete the contract.
---
Every time I open the contracts window I'm reminded that I killed her :(
---
The actual goal would be to maintain as much of the audio as possible. Simply recreate the visuals shot for shot. If that ends up failing spectacularly I will work on another proposal ;-)
---
You should check out a tool called Blender
---
As I said elsewhere, the idea is to not reimagine it, but "restore" it. I would like to preserve the audio and remake the video shot for shot in modern engine.
---
How badly do you to duck up to get banned by c sharp?

In addition to this I would recommend a stiletto alt if you are dual boxing.  One of my favorite, and in my opinion most effective for it's price, is the T1 BC.  Hurricane works best, brutix is "better" but with Ishtars still being very popular ratting ships hurricane wins on flexibility.  Hull fittings and drugs all under 100 mil a pop and you can insure them well to get a good portion of that back when you die.  If you fit for max dps and minimum tank its almost impossible to not go isk positive.  I've been experimenting with the ashimmu recently, mixed results, but once again fully fitted it can be done under 100 mil and they don't look as scary as some of the other pirate cruisers.
---
I outlined the path like .001% of newcomers end up taking it. Most guys just chill and hang out in space with like minded dudes (:
---
The best part of Eve is learning about the unknown and feeling a bit of wonder and mystery about the whole thing.
---
If they fly remote aslb cyclone they are a bad corp
---
Joke aside, check for activity (number of kills per day, the average people on killmail and the K/D ratio, even if the last one is not necessarly best :p
---
u/dreadnought98 let someone recruit you trough the programm, 1million free SP, buy the starter pack +1million free SP, buy starter pack from markee dragon 250k free SP, play tutorials find something you like and be able to train into it immediately with 2.25 mill SP.
---
profit!
---
Definitely do not extract and inject a new pilot then apply to anyone that checks ESI. You'll have to put the old pilot on the app anyway, and failing to (or biomassing it) will at best cause delays in processing it.
---
It's a feature, not a bug.  Knock yourself out!
---
I'd like to learn what one does in Eve to earn 25b/night.
---
Its called Eve-o-Preview. I doublechecked its legality and its 100% legal regarding to ccp comments. As long as these tools dont provide access to doing multiple actions on different screens with one button they are fine as i know.
---
I'd also recommend downing the eve client directly and not through steam as it'll make it easier in the long run if you decide to stay, another thing is if you decide to do mining/industry, do it on a separate character and have one for combat and one for industry/mining because the skillset is vastly different, as an alpha it'll also be free to try out so it won't hinder you as much as it would in the long run should you down the line decide you've made the wrong choice
---
So did we though. Imperium brothers and stuff
---
So wait, were all the DUST players literally just voiceless, impersonal slaves to war? Or just schizophrenic nutjobs?
---
didnt you make another post w/ the exact same char a few days ago? and it said 1700 or so visits?
---
Seems so. All they do is kill ratting ships, camp gates and fly t1 battleships. Yeah manning your Sotiyo and you'll get some nice fried pork strips. https://zkillboard.com/kill/80289552/
---
Yes.
---
R/shadowpc
---
So they aren't the safest then.
---
To get the referral bonus instead of scrapping my way from nothing.
---
I don't agree with the people saying starting a new character is dumb. I'd recommend skilling the new one into more general skills to begin with because you will probably want to get back the the old one again and then you'll have a good start towards an alt. As for the idea that you should start a new char because of your corp history it's not really a good idea. Most corps will require that you join your characters ESI when you apply and then they'll see if you've sent stuff from that character to the new one and many will then decline you for not entering all of your characters. There probably are some corps that don't like your history but I'd say most doesn't care.
---
Yeah would be something if you're at work and just flip open your phone only to unload your ore and get out mining again. The hell they even use bots for then?
---
If that's all how it goes.
---
If you follow the rules arent braindead and use the set fit you will be saved in 99.99% of cases
---
I donâ€™t worry about tank so much and go all out dps / neut, I also prefer the slot layout of the cynabal. 
---
Vaga is still my fav ship in the game, for the 2008 memories, but I prefer roaming in a cynabal.
---
An enslaved Uigur sitting in a basement farming ingame currencies in 12-hr-shifts technically is NOT a bot ...
---
Wonder if I can ticket my 9 year break from this game? :D
---
Ah that's fair the cynabal does get 3 more dps in exchange for roughly 80% of the tank.
---
l o l
---
Yes. All I managed to do was type in chat (to brag about my courage to play EVE like that) and mine a bit in hisec. It was AIDS I won't deny that. But it was also fun in a strange way.
---
When was this implemented? I remember using TeamViewer back in the day to set my skill training while I was in the office.
---
Those are the literal stats btw
---
2x gyro standard cyna fit =
---
Ding ding ding!
---
Ok )
---
If I ever got banned for having bad hair, there'd be hell toupee.
---
Using GeForce Now / Google Stadia or whatever other Streaming method you want to play EVE is totally fine. Unfortunately it's also why you were banned. That is on CCP; we need to be able to figure out the difference between a fraudster and a new customer. Sorry for the trouble, esteemed  poopy246. Please file a ticket and the GM's should get you sorted ASAP.
---
All your fits are saved in pyfa...
---
In fairness goons have the reputation on having rorqs so everyone goes to hunt in delve, is marshy and olmeca gold camping assloads of systems in ph space too?
---
Same thing they always do, just press F1
---
wew lad, that is an old ip from before ccp moved to grandagardur 8, so pre 2005-2006 i think?
---
there's no way that thing is patching :P
---
Zoomers are more FW krabs.
---
For the experience degredation, I would much rather run the games natively. The loss of visual quality is not worth it especially with a game like eve online that is goddamned beautiful
---
I see no reason for their panels of new player experience, but I'm not a new player anymore. I feel like a new audience just wants everything handed to them or to be handheld, and that just goes against what eve is at it's core. 
---
This is an investors game whether or not it's financial, person to person. The learning, the problem solving, adaptation, the test of every one of your senses from wisdom, determination, immediate perception, and even to your ability to breathe during an important moment, so you can stop shaking long enough to remind yourself what you have to do right now. 
---
The game is about learning how to learn, and that just cannot be done unless one has a genuine interest in the setting, and being able to accept where they are in the game without blaming the game itself. If you really wanted to run that mission that was too tough for your Corvette, you'd find a way. This just goes back to what you said about Morrowind, you can tell them to collect their own rocks because you don't want the reward.
---
Idk what's needed or what's the shooting schedule but I'd be willing to help, after finals week of course.
---
They dont. Some people have inflated ideas of how amazing wormholes are compared to what they actually are.
---
That's why I turn off camera shake =)
---
For sake of UI improvements.
---
Its 2019 and its embarrassing \*emoji rofl
---
&gt; Lowsec dudes who kill supers take at least 10-15 minutes to get enough dps in place to kill a super on average.
---
Citation needed.
---
I bet it was before injectors on the market.
---
This is saying that a [serpentis yard](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Serpentis_Yard) is a class of lowsec anomaly, a form of PvE that is very easy and not challenging. T5 abyssal sites are some of the hardest PvE in the game, generally requiring high/max skills, expensive  and highly specialized fits and sometimes pirate implant sets.
---
&gt;TQ has become quite crashy lately.
---
I keep hearing this, but even with the super shitty ISP's we have up in canada, I've had zero issues.
---
My understanding is the blockade was really rough on line members wallets as the mission are their primary source of income and some people had a deep enough LP wallet to continue to sell items and keep LP lower then expected. So while those with very deep LP wallets where able to make a lot of isk, line members who has less LP stored up where starting to get hurt.
---
Or the tinfoil is the leaders did this on purpose to increase the value of LP and cash out. Then ended the blockade.
---
The more the merrier.
---
Botter Passage
---
No idea, Iâ€™m not a FW member. I follow Eve politics as a hobby.
---
I like the way you took EvE's UI and somehow made it worse.
---
It's an absolute waste of effort and a constant fountain of needless stress.
---
When Lasker says "this is a game", I chuckled, people have forgotten this.....because it fattens their RL wallet.
---
Not really...
---
&gt; I use shadow
---
Right there
---
have u been there lol? Just ishtars/gilas/praxis/machs like how frat space has always been
---
i just checked and minmatar is actually the only empire i have a bad standing with lol rip
---
I mean its alright but if, after the lassie said "enemy of the gods" at the end, it kicked off into a sick drum'n'bass track and a montage of stuff exploding I'd be sold. I am a simple man.
---
Relay for Reddit has an HD button that forces imgur to load in desktop, it works really well.
---
China is probably the single most malignant thing in the world right now for everybody except China. They cheat at literally everything, especially EVE, and it kills the spirits of honest people. I miss when cheating in EVE was largely Russians farming their compounds in the Drone regions. The shit I see now is on a whole other level. Itâ€™s like a way of life. 
---
This take is a little spicy for some with easily hurt feelings though. We might need a safe space thread.
---
&gt; - In addition the CCP RP crew found the way to mess up the situation even more by putting the role-players in a corner, back to the wall by using NPCs to declare them traitors to their cause. Which is a big deal for roleplayers. On a side note, we ended up with RP NPC fleets bashing U'K citadels...
---
Ah, Looks like you guys got the drifter treatment.
---
&gt;We don't like what you are doing in the sandbox, So we are going to throw shit at you to make it change
---
Anything you could program to make it harder to bot now will just be coded away in a couple of days and the bots will be back. Finding and banning them is the only way to deal with them.
---
I've predict many contracts titled 'shut up about your Lowsec gate' in your future
---
Man you guys are like little kids any time a goon speaks.  Keep showing your ass I guess and prove my multiple points.
---
Wow.  Just wow.
---
Wave the cloud wand and all is fixed.  Yeah.  Lets go with that.
---
/u/Taagamb is not me.
---
sad to see people miss the joke here
---
/r/woooosh
---
Just use teamviewer, it's how I keep track of market orders at work.
---
weird flex but...someone got to it first...god dammit!
---
It do be like that sometimes.
---
&gt;That said, the number of corps / alliances out there that run at that kind of level outside of high class wormholes is pretty small.
---
???
---
As a human I believe that the totally real humans which also reside in the human region of Outer Passage are clearly not so-called "bots." If you were a human you would know that playing 18 hours straight is normal and well-within my mortal capabilities. I, like my fleshy compatriots, also enjoy the thrill of grinding drone sites.
---
That is what, we in the professional industry, call a BIG SAD.
---
look on zkillboard at active corps in npc areas ,see what time they`re  active to suit your timezone,tough is hard to get in unless they newb friendly.im living in stain and u should try to contact good sax,good bunch of ppl ,mostly are active in us tz

Kite them - but don't ever get caught up close. Avoid things that outrun your drones. You might get de-fanged.
---
If they were it seems like the thing to do would be to file a support ticket...

Thanks for clearing that out. I was really confused why it would be banned to use something so innocent.
---
We gave you the shit pilots we didnt want lol Its actually a running joke that you get our washouts.
---
Iâ€™ll read up on that!
---
uuuh, I just came.
---
Sorry  when was this? Why you post something like this when we even have no idea what.so.ever?  
---
Guess you haven't heard that we are a dead alliance?
---
Currently I rat with about 4 players at a given moment. Itâ€™s good fun! 
---
Have yet to deal with PvP other than get killed by gate campers as a result of my own lack of awareness. 
---
Still amazed by this masterpiece of a game.
---
Only if you let it be from what Iâ€™ve read. 
---
CSGO felt like that for me because I forgot I was playing a game, and the aim is to enjoy your time spent playing.
---
Yep, lot of roleplayers are having a blast and it's a good thing. I also think the lore team wanted to do good.
---
But a big roleplay event right in the middle of the treaty with a "either give up the treaty or face slave raids on Flos" and "you are traitors in eyes of the empire" angle was a nightmare for the alliances involved.
---
It's like throwing a party in your house the day your best friend organises his very birthday or wedding party in his own house.
---
They don't appear to be very "shared". How can they be linked in chat to be shared with anyone?
---
I was feeling that with mining and went out and did it anyways, have made a decent killing thus far with a venture and a couple drones. 
---
Ratting I waiting for a Corax rig until I dove in, and has served me well thus far. Lost two so far to negligence. 
---
Caldari is my race.
---
Gotchu!
---
Only the idiots do it with enough time to be caught; it doesn't matter how well set up you are, you wont catch someone doing a DT jump propperly
---
This is more than one hour, otherwise most of the kills wouldn't be listed.
---
I like to recommend the rail incursus, adjust things as you like to make things cheaper. Load antimatter. Add T1 rigs however you'd like or if you need to free up some space for the fit. It's a great t1 fit, flying it isn't too difficult and it's affordable. Good way to get acclimated to PVP.
