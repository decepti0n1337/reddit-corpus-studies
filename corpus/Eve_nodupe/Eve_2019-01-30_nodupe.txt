So stay out of their area. Seems like CCP plan of local conflict is working as designed based on your description. 
---
It's very much a subcap dependent deployment as PL functions primarily in a subcap first mindset. A "capital deployment" is clearly supers/titans and everything else. 
---
I think Space Brewery should get more of a mention to be fair. They have been around fighting this area for 5 years +. As long as I have anyway, maybe longer. Imagine they‚Äôve seen all done all, and now elite afk until something worthwhile comes through.

That's what he's saying though is flying a dictor is beyond most players ability

---
It's so when you can't take the game anymore you can just eject from you pod and fall to your death.
---
Jump fatigue hurts everyone, not just those abusing large numbers of capitals.
---
The latter groups often enough have the resources to bypass jump fatigue through multiple engineering complexes in multiple staging systems with a stockpile of capitals in each.
---
Nice writeup. Thank you.
---
What
---
I don't even have the ability to comprehend the mental twists here
---
So a subcap deployment is when capitals and subcaps are used
---
A cap deployment is when supercaps, caps, and subcaps are used
---
Wtf do you use on a supercap deployment? Lapetan titans or something?
---
Fine, we drop sometimes to 30% but main of the batte was playable.

Will you commit to building a ladder so long that they can climb out of it and making the bots for it if you are elected to the CSM?
---
Design wise it's doable... but as a general rule #JustSayNoToAoe for server performance reasons. 
---
It's better than it used to be for sure (it doesn't cripple the server when a keepstar PDSs) but 30 dudes in a major fleet fight? Still might be cancer. Besides, they already have really good tracking and RoF against small &amp; fast things like fighters... plus the MJD bonus actually really helps them being able to catch fighters trying to reposition around them.

Probably a good idea.

I'm truly surprised not a single vegan has come out to say that he's vegan yet... or are there no vegans in eve?

---
WTB T2 titans
---
1. A subcap deployment is where regular capitals are used as the vehicle, aka transportation method, to deploy subcaps.      
---
2. A capital deployment is focused on migrating the supers to wherever they're needed and actively use them.        
---
        
---
These two descriptions are very unique and should be distinguishable. It's very obvious when PL has a capital deployment, because wherever we move to, hostile capital meme'ing stops.
---
If it‚Äôs a 2b hole with less than 300m mass it will be reduced, but if you close it by jumping hot and close it, it will not go through the verge state and will collapse directly 
---
You want him to track down some random people he's never met in a different alliance and tell them why they're bad? Yeah, I'm sure that conversation would go well. 
---
&gt; I want to ask you, if it meant CCP could scrap the legacy code and create a modern game, would you still play eve if it had a complete restart?.
---
I'd absolutely give it a try but I don't think I'd trust 2019 CCP to hit the mark.
---
Naw, you're thinking of this: https://crabrevenge.com/

‚ÄúGoons came up in a Jackdaw fleet because they saw things happening, and brawling is way more interesting than clearing the ochre out of the belts. GOTG came by in Cormorants because they saw things happening too, but they can't afford Jackdaws.‚Äù

I would like Navy Titans. Use LP to upgrade normal titans and make them compatible to pirate titans.

LMAO :D

According to CCP's link, that's exactly what it's for.

&gt; If you want to download EVE on Windows in full up front, download [EVEResources.7z] in addition to the installer above and place it in the same folder as the installer before running it. The installer will then extract the full set of resources for EVE from that file into the shared cache.

Hey! I want mining lasers on my titan...
---
I wish either hek or rens would just merge with the other.Instead of having two hubs so close that equally suck.
---
Of course the servers are always going to eat shit... but we do already have smartbombs and normal bombs being used on these grids. I don't see how performance impact can be worse than those.
---
How does asking for your alliances help in reddit make more sense than asking in the alliance/corp chat in game?
---
Yeah it's pretty bad, the damage caps just make me so furious. 
---
what the fuck kind of fit is that?
---
Mehhh... there is a fine line between actually changing and pulling the white girl move "*omgahh we're totally starting the Mediterranean diet, it's so healthy and I bought all this super healthy chia seed stuff!*", make a couple meals, then back to the Chic F'ila norm.
---
Is there any other exploration ship that I can work towards as an alpha?
---
I got my reciept pretty instantly, on stream, it was great. 
---
I should have known something was up when my stream viewers did a 'spike in local' lol.
---
Good times. 
---
He's right about the bigger Alliances being bads, but there's tons of smaller entities undocking and getting good content every day too. He was a pubbie and it shows.
---
&gt; And it should be the defending fleet doing most of the work
---
Hell no it shouldn't, the offensive group is going into enemy territory, the defenders should have a significant advantage. 
---
And nothing about cynos either.
---
As long as capitals can instantly jump onto someone at the drop of a hat, nullsec rorq farms and carrier ratters are going to remain safe from any kind of attack as long as they have at least a couple of brain cells, and while bittervets suggest going back to the pre-Phoebe system of no jump fatigue, that's not the answer either.
---
But if you make it significantly harder to light cynos in combat, then supers/caps stop being something that can easily defend every ally in a 6/7 LY. Sure they'd still be usable in fights that you know about ahead of time or will last long enough for them to get on field but they wouldn't be the default go-to anymore.
---
CAPS ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT 
---
Supercapitals online was bad the first time around. I don't know why anyone expected any differently in bringing it back in the form of HAWs etc.
---
This is and has always been my CSM position on the matter.
---
And I can scan and do date/relics
---
Thanks! Gotta download it now üëç
---
Minus the whole eyes bleeding issue when looking at it, yeah I agree.
---
make the font bigger then it will be true
---
The T1 Exploration ships are the best you can do right now. The Heron, Probe, and Imicus will offer the same kind of scanning and hacking bonuses, but considerably cheaper. 
---
Just wait till you hit 40
---
I don't think a marauder rework would be productive unless they could receive reps and be mobile. Otherwise, they would be too susceptible to bombing runs and any enemy fleet with enough DPS to kill a battleship a minute. 
---

That doesn't rebuttal the fact both sides had relatively even numbers with the scales tilting slightly from NC's favor to Imperium favor as timezones went EU &gt; US. Just b/c PL jumped in out of range from our fleet doesn't mean they weren't there.
---
Numbers don't always matter either, and you're either stupid or seriously lack a basic understanding of eve strategy. We took a small number of pvp'ers and applied pressure to NC/PL's biggest contributor of subcaps for months. When coalition scale war broke out a group NC/PL depended on for subcap support (GOTG), whom fielded nearly 1000 subcaps a year or so beforehand, was only managing to roll out fleets of 100 (\*give or take 50\*).
---
NC/PL lost their edge, their strategic and forward thinking, and refuse to retire an outdated playbook. The \~elitist\~ snowflake restricted access cool kids club attitude didn't help either observing how no one is stepping up to replace the burnouts.
---
smartbombs aren't mainline weapons in large fights... also the area required to be effective is going to be larger. A 5000-7500m PDS for a marauder would be pointless.
---
Anytime I think of leaving Horde this is one of the big points that keeps me here. What I DO wish we did more is try to match numbers a little bit more. Must suck to fly all the way to Geminate with 25 guys looking to have a good time only to be met by 86 :/

Was something actually released? The eve websites have been referred as being in the GalNet before.
---
^ This, it works as a sink. 
---
 Also make it so that owning the sov gives a small discount in null, but still cap the number an alliance can have in a system.  That way invaders can still build if needed, so spamming citadels isn't a solid tactic, but they pay a premium to build a beachhead in systems you own.  You could rationalize it in game that you are having to pay hazard pay to the individuals constructing and maintaining the structure in hostile space.
---
Also with this you make it so that the tax goes up to a certain level with the number of citadels, so that if you do build to the top of the tax, the invader also pays a premium.  Still make it so that it doesn't scale infinitely, so that you don't get a bunch of different alliances all building in one system to raise the price.
---
It would also be cool if the corp/alliance standing with the owners of NPC space helped with the tax, so that standing mattered again.
---

So I decided to collate my thoughts on the whole as regards the Kikimora, and in particular the (at least somewhat) more common shield gank kiting fit. I'll also largely be ignoring the notional idea of locus rigs, because they're not even on Sisi or rumored to be in development AFAIK, outside of some wishful thinking. They would totally help out the Damavik though.

---
This is the variation that I'm actually flying right now- I'm personally rather averse to skipping on a DC for something that's reliant on shield buffer like this is. However you can also swap the DC to a nano and then drop a polycarb for a CDFE; this gives slightly more shield buffer, and a little more speed/agility, but I personally dislike the "fold over and die" aspect that it will likely face if it loses shields.
---
Anyways so this fit does require 1% CPU implant as presented, but those are super cheap and you can also hunt for reduced CPU abyssal variants of some mods.
---
It takes \~65 seconds to fully spool its damage, and at its preferred engagement range (\~20-30 km)... and most skirmish/kiting cruiser weapons track it well enough to easily vaporize it.
---
An Omen Navy for example has \~330 DPS with Scorch and triple heat sinks, and with dual locus rigs shoots to \~46 km optimal, with some falloff. Also it has some drones but we'll ignore those. So pretty much at 10 km the Nomen does \~100 DPS with Scorch, but if a Kiki is 10 km away from you and you're pretty sure he's shield gank fit then you have to be a giant tomato to still have Scorch loaded when lasers (and now disintegrators) are the gods of instant ammo swapping.
---
If he decides to sit at his preferred 20-30 km range.... well the Nomen applies \~240 DPS and climbing from 20 km onward. And that's assuming the Kikimora is getting a perfect 90\* orbit track (it probably won't) and the Nomen isn't trying to transversal match (it probably will if not tomato). Even then the Nomen has both buffer, an AAR, and injector, so it can conceivably trade well enough to make the Kikimora bugger off- the shield Kiki *can't* trade with nano cruisers, which it is only just slightly faster than (\~2758 m/s cold on a quad LiF and dual polycarbs, no implants or drugs, vs \~2530 m/s for a single nano Nomen with no drugs or implants).
---
Hilariously enough even with Barrage an AC Cynabal can trade quite equitably with a shield Kiki- remember that the DPS takes *65* seconds to reach the superduper awesome peak, and by that point the Kiki will probably have decided to leave, or else be almost dead.
---
Similarly a beam Narb or rail BNI can easily swat a shield Kiki- it gets to close and suddenly a heated FedNavy web appears (or Dark Blood if that's more your speed), and said web might even be self-linked because ~~aliens~~ battlecruisers. Even without the web, at \~25 km even with max transversal a shield Kiki is taking 250+ DPS from a beam Narb or rail BNI.
---
Beam Confessors and both 150 and 125 railgun Hecates can out-project a Kikimora, with 125 rail Hecates hitting \~57 km with dual locus rigs, and a single locus 150 rail Hecate going to \~65 km optimal range (the 150 rail fit is stupidly hard to fit unfortunately, and I suspect the only way you could "fleet fit" it is by running TCs/TEs instead of locus rigs and using bulkheads+DC to give it enough buffer for reps to land if you were deadset on a 150 rail fit). A dual locus focused beam Confessor gets 70 km optimal with Aurora.
---
Also all of those can apply \~200 DPS to a max-transversal shield Kikimora *even with tracking penalized ammo*, at 20 km all the way to the end of their optimals. With non-penalized ammo you're looking at 250-300 DPS from *10* km to end of optimal.
---
This also doesn't cover the issues of lock range (why you would sebo the mids of a smallgang/solo ship is fucking beyond me when you usually want a point to hold shit down so it actually dies instead of just warping off)- you might be able to solve that with a signal amp, field projector rig(s), or a combination, but that's going to sacrifice tank/speed/damage- while the sebo fit commits the (I'd imagine) cardinal sin of small gang ships: sacrificing utility.
---
This *also* doesn't cover the ramJag menace, which is... problematic. For basically any MWD ship bigger than a frigate, and some of those too. And is also super common and the ramJag and ramWolf have become the preferred heavy tackle frigates for most bigger groups.
---
Oversized AB ships have much less problem with getting executed by cruiser-size weapons which project very well, but also trades off by being slower (significantly so; you lose \~750 m/s compared to the MWD shield fit), and much more difficult to fit, *and* generally having to use its low slots for both tank and damage, rather than *choosing* to include a DC instead of a nano (at the cost of requiring abyssal rolls to reduce CPU usage of some modules or else using a CPU implant).
---
They also have all the agility and grace of a dead whale supported by a drunken hippo.
---
*With all that said*, personally I'd like a 5th low on the Kikimora so the dual rep 10mn fit can try and squeeze in a damage mod and also a 5th mid (and a bunch more PG) so I can try and get a 100mn AB Drekavac to also have full tackle an injector and a MJD in addition to the prop. Also without using all 3 rig slots for ACRs. With dual links. And a medium smartbomb. And dual reps.

What a outlandish and wild suggestion to make that there are competent csm members. 
---
I‚Äôd say Eve should keep tranquility, and open up a new server that doesnt have skill injectors, plex, or skins.
---
The server is also omega only, only allows 2 accounts logged in at a time kind of like alphas, but allpws 2 so we can at least light our own cynos.
---
Also removes some isolated null sov regions by breaking the gates, thus making null sov a bit more rare.
---
I‚Äôd also like to see some changes to encourage smaller groups like capping alliance/corp size and limiting blueing and such. 
---
A doubling of a rorqs seige timer with half the current yield and 1/4 the drone speed or some such balance to push rorqs into powerful buff ships but ineffective miners thus encouraging people playing with each other while reducing the huge influx of materials.
---
While we‚Äôre at it we can implement citadel‚Äî&gt;capital‚Äî&gt;subcap triangle balance.
---
I can imagine ccp could earn a few thousand more subs and resubs for a new fresh start ‚Äúhardcore‚Äù server without injectors and some hard coded emphasis on smaller groups. 
---
oof
---
I think you really misunderstand TEST. Sure I'm in TEST, but what I put in my bottom is of my own free will and I personally prefer something lower in sugar like a nice Sprite Zero powder pack. 
---
This 10/10
---
You may not know this, but I've literally been saying the exact same thing for two years.
---
The defending fleet should have the advantage of having their resources and numbers close by.  The ability to reship in a small span of time is a massive advantage to a defending fleet, as well as having the reach of a citadel on grid.  An offensive group is already at a disadvantage at equal numbers.  But a citadel should not be able to sit on its own and take out cap upon cap.  1v1 citadel vs cap should be advantageous to the citadel, small gang shouldn‚Äôt do well against a citadel, but a fleet should be able to kill a citadel easily if its the only target on grid.  That‚Äôs why a defense fleet defends the citadel.
---
Even if Eve shuts tomorrow, it'll all have been worth it just for this post.

There is no evidence in your picture that they spam jita constantly?

Well tbh, i say this a lot.. the only way you learn in Eve on what not to do is either watch someone else fuckup badly or do it yourself. Either way you have to observe it first-hand to react to it.
---
There's no "tutorial" out there that says "this is the do's and don'ts of flying a titan". We often forget that at times you build up your skill tree to get into these toys and then you're somehow overnight expected to know the breadth/depth of flying it.

School of Hardnocks is a harsh but fair teach. In this case, i guarantee you he'll never confuse jump for bridge again :D and will be waaay more cognisant of what a titan fit FC / bridge wise is minimum required.

To put it another way, I'd double down on Jacob as a titan pilot / fc way more now than ever before because of this moment. In fact I will be putting my ISK where my mouth is by following his lead in a titan fight should it come down to it.

Make two access lists. One for "free" and one for public. Add your corp to the free list and add the public option to the other list. Add both lists to your corp office window and then you can set the price to 0 isk for the free access list and whatever price for the public access list.

Yeh definitely not an easy game to balance. Specially with us constantly breaking it.

Just wish the csm was used more as a think tank and we had regular balance patches instead of leaving stuff for 2 years

Weekend Warriors came in with a Nightmare fleet because they live two jumps away and have a solid, salt-of-the-earth lo-sec belief that everything in space should die, and they brought Iron Armada with them. At the same time, Shadow Cartel came by in Muninns because the more the merrier. Goons came up in a Jackdaw fleet because they saw things happening, and brawling is way more interesting than clearing the ochre out of the belts. GOTG came by in Cormorants because they saw things happening too, but they can't afford Jackdaws.

I literally have more fun nowadays replaying single player Skyrim or Gal Civ II. 
---
It got to where logging in after a long days work, with whatever fun idea I daydreamed about trying on and off all day, I was smacked with reality of the massive amount of planning logistics luck etc etc it would take before I was ever 'playing'. 
---
I apologise, you didn't depress me, the idea of logging in did. 
---
If everybody just keeps to their own little slice of the universe then the game will just stagnate and die. 
---
&gt; Oh you're in that us vs them world still 
---
shitlers gonna shit right?
---
I knew you would break at some point and get rid of the good guy mask.
---
I think you need to update dhsj to say something along the lines of "Will make masterful ms paint renditions whining about you blobbing and batphoning to fight them. Then batphone  horde, init and nc. And yes the irony is lost on them"
---
It's over already.
---
Do they sting? 
---
and they are clearly aren't spending any of it fighting bots.
---
Removed - No AAR
---
yeah, theres 1 fax, lmao. No shit a dreadbomb worked.
---
Takes notes PGL, hope the person you are dropping a dread bomb on, is so fucking stupid they dont have enough FAX, and make sure to pretend you are super good cause of it, lmao yeah yeet 420 this is eve boi
---
*Smash that like and subscribe button*
---
Remove the public option from your access list and put it in its own access list. 
---
Lasers are too cap hungry for an active mission running tank imo. Sentry drones also don't use ammo. And Missiles only care about the absolute speed and sig radius of the rats not the transversal.
---
Well at least he's taking the recent campaign failure well.
---
I could get behind this
---
My favorite thing about Eve is like you can be talking to any sort of self declared nerd or power dork and if you let slip you play, they're like, "Oh holy fuck what a nerd you are that's just ridiculous."
---
Keep us updated. Fascinating stuff
---
16 years and counting....
---
Smidge more cpu on golem too plz (or reduce torp fitting requirements, thatd be dope too)
---
HAH We fist for big explode lololol you not make THIS can't make do for messing with
---
Im sorry what kind of dumb shit are you suggesting here, I live in a wh, i dont have anything to do with PL, the only dealings i have with nullsec in general now are to kill people where my wh opens up.
---
It's a Pope hat
---
That won't change the fact no one has balls to attack goons and deny they rorq haven you do know that right ?
---
Here's my setup: 
---
Publicly accessible structures: https://i.imgur.com/QJ0UCLW.png
---
Access list: https://i.imgur.com/IwPGpmM.png
---
It's set up the opposite of what you want where I only charge one corp a fee (at their request). 
---
&gt; That doesn't rebuttal the fact both sides had relatively even numbers with the scales tilting slightly from NC's favor to Imperium favor as timezones went EU &gt; US. Just b/c PL jumped in out of range from our fleet doesn't mean they weren't there.
---
This part is a bold faced lie.
---
&gt;Numbers don't always matter either, and you're either stupid or seriously lack a basic understanding of eve strategy.
---
More lies, literally everybody but you can admit that the only thing that matters in EVE is numbers.
---
&gt;**We took a small number of pvp'ers** and applied pressure to NC/PL's biggest contributor of subcaps for months. When coalition scale war broke out a group NC/PL depended on for subcap support (GOTG), whom fielded nearly 1000 subcaps a year or so beforehand, was only managing to roll out fleets of 100 (*give or take 50*).
---
Bolded the part that was a lie, you seem to have a common thread in your post.
---
&gt;NC/PL lost their edge, their strategic and forward thinking, and refuse to retire an outdated playbook. The ~elitist~ snowflake restricted access cool kids club attitude didn't help either observing how no one is stepping up to replace the burnouts
---
I actually believe you believe that, which makes it so much better.  Literally everybody involved from the top down is different, which makes this what?
---
You guessed it, another bold faced lie.  
---
I didn't know you were a Republican?
---
My response:
---
1. Super capitals should apply damage fully to capitals and structures when using their turrets, launchers, and fighters, and effectiveness should decrease exponentially depending on sig radius. Doomsday should apply to all ships and structures but increase cycle times. 
---
2. Increase cycle times for all doomsday weapons
---
3. Reduce fighter effectiveness exponentially based on sig radius for subcaps.
---
4. See points above.
---
5. Rorquals die frequently so their tank isn't an issue. Make mining less awful before nerfing excavators again. 
---
6. Disable all modules (active and passive) and movement when activating a cyno. Make the cyno ship easier to destroy. 
---
Make PVE in general less of a chore so people resort less to BFGs to do those activities and make BFGs mostly applicable for PVP. 
---
INIT. took on 4 fleets with only the support of jackdaws, which were late and also did nothing useful. Ballsy; Snuff were surprisingly absent.
---
GotG is shit, in other news water is in fact wet.
---
That was exciting seeing the cynos pop and all the shit jump in
---
So salty, and actually horde wasnt batphoned, not sure who they got the Intel from but they decided to pull a bro move and help DHSJ out. Pretty awesome actually.
---
my dick was so hard when the fucking proteus decloaked right on our sub fleet
---
 **Assalamu ‚ÄòAlaikum** 
---
Fake news, nobody trusts Snuff
---
Hobos not even has four did
---
So what is a PL supercap deployment? 
---
Also, the post you‚Äôre replying to stated ‚Äòstrict subcap deployment.‚Äô To any normal human brain, strict implies ‚Äònot using anything other than subcaps in combat.‚Äô
---
Then you get Mortal Engines
---
Nice armor super fleet, seems it was very useful on this campaign ayyyy
---
Obvi you want to go amarr because that‚Äôs what you started training. You can run level 4 in a legion or an Apoc. It maybe won‚Äôt be as fast as other options but you can def do it. 
---
Perimeter‚Äôs Keepstar is on fire and Trade War is hot, yet Semiki‚Äôs malware incident has an unexpected development. In a sudden turn of events, SARO operative Oveg Drust demands Semiki emergency actors to hand over all the available material, putting the lives of those affected by the cybernetics-targeting malware at risk.

The space RP panorama for today:
---
* ARC counsel to file petition to unseal directives governing Case Red Gamma - 
---
*
---
Imperial loyalists purge Blood Raiders in response to Deathglow attacks
---
* CONCORD agent states risk of emergent attacks against trinary data concentrations, claims unsubstantiated
---
* Angel leadership combats unrest, growing dread of Guardian Gala
---
* Rogue drone speculation causes commodity price spike
---
* Opening of Dantumi VI-5 ‚Äòburgers and brats‚Äô eatery delayed due to unknown contaminant
---
Looks like they cut the head off the snake on that one. Well played Snuff. 
---
I wanted to leave room for pizza...
---
Tapi having a rough week lol
---
Hear that dude, my CEO being an amazing FC and Corp and alliance being full of interesting dudes is what keeps me going. I sincerely hope another game comes along or maybe magically something in eve is fixed to give me the wonder and excitement I got back in 2008. :)
---
Level 2: Coercer, Punisher
---
Level 3: Omen, Harbinger
---
Level 4: Harbinger, Apocalypse, Abaddon
---
Navy versions for more chooch. The others if you have good drone skills.
---
In your lows, fit at least two active hardeners that suit your enemy and an Energized Adaptive Nano Mebrane, rest one or two armor reppers, cap or heat sinks in what's left. Mids should be afterburner or microwarpdrive, rest cap. Highs should be guns, try not to mix beams and pulse.
---
He's asking what space you live in. Amarr, caldari, gallente, minmatar. Each space has different rats. Different rats require different fitting. Different ships are more optimised at fighting some types. For example in amarr regions, you are more likely to face rats that are weak against em and thermal which is precisely what the amarr ships are bonuses for. 
---
Title is fake news....Should be "NBSI hard for TAPI to Understand"
---
Yeah, they're...special. They tried recruiting my corp 4 times, 2 of those whilst our parent corp  had them wardecced for mission running, having a galmil farming alt corp,  and generally being complete...whatchumacallsit. Like me having a 2 hour argument in militia with biohazard because I was being too harsh  on chinese galmil farmers and bots. 
---
The wardec led to some interesting kills, including this [Nereus](https://zkillboard.com/kill/73708994/) carrying PLEX through Sosala. The cherry on top is that Hopper decided to cry for help in  miltia chat, which he  actually got until they realized that this was inter militia conflict. 
---
Recently, Aslon pmed me again, asking whether I wanted to join Winmatar for ['more coordination, goals, and ops'.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/451881565861969940/536927506985648162/unknown.png) 
---
Unsuprisingly, I refused. On the list of alliances to join, Winmatar comes after FedUp for me, and I'm hardline Amarr. They keep  forgetting that for some reason. It amuses me to no end. 
---
I miss you man :(
---
Clearly we need three posts for this shit.
---
Hey Test, remember that time you got the invite to kill Tri titans?
---
You got an invite again.
---
oh
---
Well i was thinking everyone hated us(dhsj). We dont even need to call people now,they just come by themselve...thx for the surpise guys.
---
maybe i'm just a spodbrain but I always take out my DD to do a bridge
---
like if I'm spod enough to jump then a single target DD is unlikely to save my ass anyways
---
This was all a ruse so PGL could get more video evidence of op supers &amp; titans.
---
Hoping next month it continues to be a bad *year*.
---
Country Roads
---
ooo i like this
---
Shh, downvoted inbound
---
Don‚Äôt criticize the dinobrains 
---
I remember the wars in 2012- massive battleship fleets slugging it out. Multiple smaller gang fleets zipping around pipes going for stragglers. 
---
Lol. You mofos brought 100-150 to fight our 50 man fleet, and bitch when 200 drop on you. cry cry. 
---
haHAA
---
*puts pinkie toe into delve*
---
#60 TITANS JUMP IN AND BOSON
---
Well done by Snuff, GF. I'm glad we didn't lose more than we did.
---
But accurate?
---
I wasn't even there lol but was expecting snuff tbh but wew lad
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=xzpndHtdl9A
---
What is the rogue drone speculation?
---
Finally! 
---
Did you just assume my opinion?
---
Close, spear fishing is chaining booshes (aoe mjds that teleport everything within range 100 km away) to jump in on stuff, then jump out with some of the fleet (or in this case, some excavators), leaving them 100km away from help where you can freely kill them. Wait out the mjd cool down, rinse and repeat.
---
I just did. I don't like Kool-aid. It's like you're not even listening to me. 
---
I'm sure I'm not the only ustz guy who was at work,  mashing refresh on zkill on his phone while giggling like a 4 year old who's just discovered a toy that farts.  
---
btw if u didnt know u can shoot falcons while they jam u now
---
Times are hard
---
[removed]
---
Horde elected to help DHSJ because A) they were getting mega-blobbed B) Pred creates good content in low sec C) We like to shoot stuff.
---
Dude, you're so dumb my teeth hurt.
---
F\*\*\*ing love it
---
sometimes they let me salvage the wrecks if i ask nicely
---
Yeah but they‚Äôd pay monthly 
---
There are discussions about that...
---
There is loads to unpack and poop on here, so thank god for the new formatting on reddit:  
---
&gt;Rorqual tremendous tank and invincible? With a bunch of bombers and a couple of command destroyers you can turn an impressive amount of them to ashes... Stuka fleets and bombers bar are the proof. 
---
By "a bunch of bombers and a couple of command destroyers", do you mean like 100 bombers and 10-20 command destroyers? Stuka fleets are massive and so are bombers bar fleets, in high-dps ships. So yeah, they do have tremendous tank and are invincible for 7 minutes. The fact that it's merely *possible* to kill them with 150 guys in bombers doesn't change that.
---
&gt;Let's be honest, injectors NEVER, NEVER, NEVER helped new players, a newbie don't even know on which skill use SP. Injectors were always primary used by experienced players which had a lot of isks 
---
Yeah cool story, but as someone who only started playing 3 years ago, I injected from the moment they came out. Most of my isk went into that.  
---
&gt;On the other hand imho rorq mining was an excellent evolution. It gave the opportunity to anyone to develop to industrial/production, also people that don't have a lot of accounts and can't have or don't want many of them. It was also necessary to another very good evolution with moon mining, reducing passive income and going in the right direction: the more you put effort into the game, the more you get from the game. 
---
Do you really think moon empires were retained without effort? I hate to break it to you, but sitting and pressing F1 on rocks is not more effort than fighting over and for moons. It's also a lot less interesting.  
---
I'm all for making rorqs worth fielding, but the economy is fucked and there is almost no viable subcap content to be found in nullsec these days. You can have better industry without fucking subcap pvp into the dirt.
---
 Great aar by the way.    
---
Jesus tittyfucking Christ on a pogo-stick, this is why we need Grath.
---
That's a good post.
---
It was a ballsy play to try to secure a bunch of kills on super capitals. There was really not a need for it, the shit was getting reinforced one way or another, but the idea was to kill anything still there that we could. I think it netted at least 1 Titan kill? Can't really remember now.
---
Snuff was on the way to help, but got sidetracked.
---
Glad it worked out.
---
&gt;R2D2 is the true hero
---
RDR2 is god, fite me

The BR is bad [https://zkillboard.com/related/30002392/201901300100/](https://zkillboard.com/related/30002392/201901300100/)
---
I should know by now that if I insure then we don't drop, god dammit, I'm now on my fourth insurance on this dread.
---
Miss you too
---
Stroke your BBC, cause you are what you are.  
---
:twists the knife:
---
As a Cap pilot (I have a Super Carrier no Titan) I have to agree Suppers/Titans are to powerful. When a fight is on I ALWAYS join the sub cap fleet. It's just more fun. Warping in and out of a fight. Trying to get a tactical advantage. That's what I find "fun".
---
 Sitting in one spot bubbled up watching fighters inch across the screen in 10% TiDi just sucks imo. Or watching the timer pass waiting to boson again. That's as much fun as sitting on jita undock in a tornado for a hour waiting for some defenseless nerd to undock a T1 hauler. 
---
Supers have there place in the game. But ATM everyone uses them as a win ticket. 'Whoever drops the most Titans win.' 
---
Is that how you really want to play this game? 
---
Hey Test, remember when you got an invite to kill Tri titans?
---
You got an invite again. Thanks for showing.
---
Already replaced... Good drop though. 
---
Just chilling on a fort... chatting on comms ... neut Devoter?!... "Primary Devoter!!!!".... then more and more and more ... heart racing.
---
People who use neon green on a white background need to be drawn, quartered and, killed until dead. 
---
That br might not be 100% accurate.  
---
You have init on both sides of it.   
---
Plus 100% selectable damage,  so you can always pick resist holes 
---
I love BBC
---
Coercers are good for Eve
---
Supers are bad
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
^^oh ^^shit ^^wrong ^^thread
---
And the extracted every. Fucking. Dread.
---
And they're alway recruiting whoever they can get their hands on. 
---
&gt;IIRC NC / PL were the ones that forced this era of EVE Online by first forming a mega coalition to take out Goons from Deklein 
---
Yes, we did. Successfully, because it was "impossible".
---
&gt; and then stabbing Test in the back forcing them out and set up ‚Äòenemy of my enemy‚Äô diplomacy. 
---
TEST stabbed themselves in the back when Vily got the dumbs again. They did dumb shit and got shat on from a great height. They could have kept Vale, built supers and enjoyed life, but they had fucking stupid leadership that just had to poke the bear.
---
&gt; Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong though!
---
Fuck off.
---
Actually easier to read
---
also makes the Rorqual op much harder to secure because now you have to accept every newbie with a pulse and a barge into the fleet.
---
It was quite the clusterfuck 
---
keep doing whatever it is you're doing with that sprite zero. It seems to be having an effect
---
[https://br.inyour.space/?s=2537&amp;b=8457060&amp;e=1530&amp;t=irfveaaf](https://br.inyour.space/?s=2537&amp;b=8457060&amp;e=1530&amp;t=irfveaaf)  
---
So this was a mess, and had alot of back and forth. For the past few weeks SGGN / SC  have been bat phoned  CVA/DnG/SF. + others from time to time to form up too 200 people to hit our structures in the area, and or to fight us. So roughly 40 v 100+.   
---
[https://zkillboard.com/kill/74820285/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/74820285/)  
---
144 to kill a Astra from a 40 man corp (just mains)  
---
So last Thursday they hit our Fort in Ama, and followed up on it Friday, we mounted a defense fleet and tried to get help, but wasn't able to do much other then feed some stuff, and almost kill a dread. So the stage was set the Fort was on final timer for 0030 Weds Eve Time. We reached out to who we could expecting the normal turn out of SGGN bat phoned anyone who he can, to fight a small low sec corp.   
---
Then today we get news that all but one of our bat phones can not make it due to them having their own timers and things to attend to. Plus Intel that snuff was in the area with supers and titans (they were after test not us, lol) so things seemed dire. We decide to take the fight knowing the odds, and set off in our brawl bs fleet against what we knew would be nightmares and eagles plus caps at some point.   
---
As we tether up on the Fort our bat phone INT. and INT Mer. jumped in to help us as SGGN/SC/CVA/DNG piled in and starting to shoot the Fort, We moved out and engaged targets where we can, with INT. warping in and out on them harassing them to try and keep the Fort Repair timer ticking losses were taken and hope seemed lost. Local was climbing and it was P.Horde.....great we thought they were called to kill the fort too.  
---
But after receiving a convo from them, they said they wanted to help "xxxxxt &gt; im down to help ya'll against the big lowsec meanies" was like music to our ears. P.Horde quickly destroyed SGGN/SC/CVA/DnG faster then we could get positioned to support, even the fort didn't have time to get in on the beating they were taking. 
---
So this fight was more about luck have someone showing up to help us with our backs against the wall, DHSJ can not take credit for this victory other then helping provide the content for those to showed up to fight. Thank you to our blues who showed up (you know who you are), and thinks for providing Kill mails to our friends SGGN/SC.
---
Toni out
---
What is this cringe posting, holy shit Snuff; sort it out.
---
Too many trolls. Apoc isn‚Äôt terrible, mjd and beam lasers. Armageddon and abaddon are meh. Nightmare is not strictly amarr but can be fun. Paladin is overkill for level 4‚Äôs but as an amarr fanboy I love it to death
---
Harbingers/prophecies are tanky enough for level 3‚Äôs and maybe some level 4‚Äôs if you know what you‚Äôre doing 
---
If you like kiting with the coercer, maybe try an omen as your next upgrade. 
---
I have 3 lists.
---
- Alliance
---
- Coalition
---
- Services
---
Only services is free. This is not a Freeport. Alliance a d coalition have different prices. No one is charged though.
---
On another note, everyone except one alliance CEO are paying the current jump clone fees. He gets his for free too.
---
&gt;1. Gimme Shelter is the best Rolling Stone song.
---
Whoa, stop right there.
---
they didn't mean too tho.  they were expecting SV stuka do support them, but SV seemed to struggle with firstly a hostile t3d fleet and secondsly a rather technical doctrine which they didn't seem that experienced with.
---
but i guess you wanna find a way of giving init some credit however undeserved vOv
---
You did, I remeber it.
---
Paquito &gt; why even bother undocking lmao
---
&gt;Paquito &gt; why even bother undocking lmao
---
Ah shit that's hilarious, aoe micro jump drives now? That beats mom dropping any day.
---
Schnecktsh ish fine.. we're not drunksh.. \*hic\*
---
Machine learning... hmmmmmmm
---
I wonder how well CCP would implement that considering their history, my bet is A LOT of innocent people would get banned lmao
---
You're totally right. Nobody hardly even noticed the chat problems or lurch HICs or whatever for months, right?! So it's totally ok that they take a year+ to finally address those sorts of issues in any way whatsoever.
---
Oh wait.
---
The range is something like 6km, and the module can only be fit by certain t2 destroyers, but it‚Äôs still a pretty sweet mechanic when you see it done right.
---
Its the exact same thing you linked. However we're not complaining.
---
turn on your monitor
---
See #2     
---
         
---
I also just explained that to you. The subcaps have to get to the deployment system somehow. They're merely transports.
---
it got us sort dragon at the very least
---
Not even a contest, Querns will piss PGL off in the first statement, PGL will get mad (made complete with the signature "ohgodyou'resooostupid") and Querns will have him by the balls, they will trade insults, noone will care and everything is back to normal.
---
Try Fortnite instead. 
---
hahrahrahrhahah dum gons
---
solo logi frig: 5/5
---
We want fights not running
---
Thanks for explaining that. Don't think I would have wasted energy trawling reddit info to find that out or even bothering to google that shit, but I sure gathered that it was a reddit "mechanic" from the instant negative feedback allright :D  It's almost hilarious the amounts of instant braindead juvenile alpha-male'ing attempts in here anyway. highscool dogpile in order not to try to look cool / not be seen as uncool obviously.  Pretty sub level iq needed to participate or feel one has to or really needs to. Whats it called? Common? Average? a feature of below average social skills? Well. Pretty inconsequential at any rate. Sure sends a bunch of pretty clear signals about the mental competence, self insight, and psyche of the originator though. On so many levels as it were. 
---
You can jam anything up there you want just be considerate of the sugar and calories. New year new me ya know. 
---
G*dbless test for their friendship
---
Thanks and I really like the Paladin too... I kinda lost one not too long ago though, I posted about it
---
I'll probably try an Apoc when I get there, don't want to risk anything too expensive and all, I still want a return at some point xd
---
Omen next then, okay! Thanks again 
---
Can somebody tell me what he said about the Damavik? https://youtu.be/D4p3CziehT0?t=4945 From the beginning until the Damavik escapes...
---
he is blue to me, i told them the bubble is here and to warp to a planet first, but there is always one... 
---
One objection to OP. TRI considered being a major factor in all of this, Lols :)
---
They outnumbered NCPL in caps when they lived in Dekelin, they just had no fucking clue how to use them.
---
I literally told them they could finish builds and leave peacefully for free if they wanted.  I explicitly didn't want anyone to feel like I was trying to strongarm them into agreeing to terms they didn't want.  
---
If you have any actual evidence that some of them are botters though please DM me.
---
jUsT dEfaNg 1o0 sUperS GuYs
---
I'm 99% sure they are the actual longest holding sov alliance with more than 2-3 systems.
---
That‚Äôs not from me it‚Äôs from sucking Grath‚Äôs dick too long.
---
&gt;When was the last time anyone actually used one? Is progod still mad about his nightmare fleet being chain gtfo‚Äôd by NC?
---
*HAKONEN FLASHBACKS*
---
You're never going to win this battle man.  Just be clean for you not for anyone else.  That's how I sleep at night.
---
"www"
---
shit, that message is still on cooldown, im dead
---
Fixing cynos is easy.  Make a Cyno module like a polarized weapon and set all resiatances to 0.  It wont mess with people moving JF but will make hot dropping much harder (and hot dropping is cancer).  Large fleet fights will no lonher have every pilot with a Cyno equipped and choosing which ships do and dont have them will becone a strategic decision.
---
Actually very surprised that no goon spies noticed the super fleet moving, INIT caps jumped in when most of our supers were two jumps out of x47 
---
Tau was against this. Hy took charged and led the betrayal.
---
I was about to contradict you, then realized that WWB was in 2016.
---
Damn time flies.
---
I've sunk a lot of sp into amarr and lasers :S feelsbad
---
The problem isn't the capitals. If the game lasts long enough you can expect everyone to get to top of the chain, and unless they quit at that point, you'll see blobs of whatever the fotm is.
---
The problem is that it's too easy to coordinate blobs. The only thing f1 pushers need to do is lock a broadcast and press f1 (although some even struggle with that).
---
What needs to happen, is complete removal of fleet broadcasts, as well as removal of player owned vessels from the overview.
---
This will make the task of managing the blob exponentially harder, favouring smaller more tight knit fleets. It will also mitigate the n+1 factor to a degree. 
---
Hey! I understood that too.   
---
So why am I still here then and not playing eve ffs.    
---
5 minutes too long away from the EVE client.  
---
Thanks for reminding me to install NEAR2 again though.   
---
Knew there was a reason the (EVE) universe brought me here. Outta here.  again. 
---
how would people know that i can triple their isk then
---
Apoc fit should be under 200m, plus insurance is pretty nice on t1 ships so a loss would only set you back 75m at the most on a t2 fit. And that‚Äôs only if you lose it 
---
Omen is a fun space boat, and a decent platform for you to work on support skills with as well 
---
&gt; Never going to happen because CCP isn't going to nerf what is making money. 
---
Wasn't concurrent user peaks back in like 2012 twice what they are now? Before rkrq changes and skill injectors? Hmm.
---
I joined in that time and it was still pretty amazing. I was in some of the big long tidi slugs and some of the campaigning and had all sorts of fun. I think it's easy to forget for those of us that have gotten past the newbie stage that back then just flying a new ship, or seeing a big fleet undock and warp together was enough to be enthralled. The mechanics of this game are so deep and intricate that when you start, that feeling of knowing so little about the game makes it that more incredible just to be in on it at all.
---
Now fast forward a couple of years and a lot of that stuff is pretty boring to me, but I still enjoy being part of a big effort to do something meaningful, regardless of how small I am. Add onto that the relationships I have made and the things I have achieved myself, and I would say I feel my money and time has been well spent.
---
you realize you can just press Cntrl + Up arrow and the last thing you posted is postable again in chat right?
---
I scam on an alt while doing shit on my main. "oh nice, lost a fighter, better post my scan" Alt + Tab, Cntrol + Up arrow.
---

The creator of ISBoxer bypassed warden with ISXWarden. Just saying, also just change Warden to Eve and that one is still around...
---
Yeah you're right, that 16,000 person alliance that drops a titan on me every time I stroll into their space in a frigate certainly doesn't have supers/titans. Is this a joke? [https://zkillboard.com/kill/74780887/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/74780887/)
---
Couple of things...
---
&gt;When a fight is on I ALWAYS join the sub cap fleet.
---
You're lucky, I have to log in subcap, super and fax, just to compete with your blob. 
---
You guys regularly outnumber us 3:1 on the field, but it's actually 6:1 in real people. I don't know why we even bother, sometimes...
---
&gt;Supers have there place in the game. But ATM everyone uses them as a win ticket. 'Whoever drops the most Titans win.' 
---
Nope, not correct. Stupidity and hubris has killed more cap/super fleets than anything else. Y2-ANO, Uemon, 15W-GC, HED-GP, B-R5B...SH1, 9-4, X47, etc...
---
Eve history is full of examples.
---
&gt;Is that how you really want to play this game? 
---
I don't know any other way to play this game.
---
This is dumb, the same question keeps popping up. They have their niche, they do it well.
---
They rarely get used for PvP because, as you should have guessed, they're not designed to be a PvP ship.
---
What niche could they possibly fill that hasn't already been filled?! Let's get the other ships sorted then look at the ones that are already balanced
---
Your inability of you to counter anything I said and just regurgitate ‚ÄúREEE LIE REE‚Äù shows that not only have you grown out of touch with EVE as the years process, but you are also starting to demonstrate signs of dementia. 
---
1st point is absolutely true, there is LITERALLY video and dscans of opposing super fleets. 
---
2nd &amp; 3rd point also 100% happened as well, there are numerous pages of killboards to support this, logs, corporation statistics, actual closed alliances from fail cascades, ADM drops, etc. the list goes on. 
---
4th point is my personal analysis but supported by the sheer fact that they have done absolutely nothing of noteworthiness in two years. They have lost every. single. offensive. that they both participated in. EVERY SINGLE ONE - THEY HAD TO RETREAT FROM FUCKING BRAVE (no offense Brave Newbros).
---
‚Äú*YES I KNOW 1000s OF SCIENTIST HAVE ALL PUBISHED RESEARCH IN AGREEMENT BUT HUMANS DON‚ÄôT CONTRIBUTE TO ANY NEGATIVE INFLUENCE ON THE CIMATE*‚Äù - probably Grath.
---
From reading your posts I think you might suffer from an actual lack of intelligence so I‚Äôm just not gonna entertain your postings.
---
&gt; Paquito &gt; why even bother undocking lmao 
---
yes
---
They kept dropping those supers on our moa fleets that we had newer FCs trying to run during the Christmas slump
---
Glad to see they got what was coming to them, very cool skill urself!
---
I see the point, but also, if the role for caps was shooting structures, they wouldn't be a very compelling endgame/apex ship that people would want to get into.
---
How much didn't you lose.
---
It's possible that you've said it, but your credibility is exactly zero, at this specific point in time.
---
Ahh okay, I could do the missions with drones in an Armageddon? They do different damage types right?
---
MJD Ravens are so op that everyone secretly agreed to not use them cause it wouldnt be fair/fun clearly.
---
An extension of that thought is that if we just had more large scale battle, and changes to the game mechanics that would encourage them, we would see some correction in these numbers.  Need more Titan fleets exchanging ships to downtime.  
---
Every game needs an aspirational element.  Something that people strive to get or accomplish.  Titans and supers are still that for a good number of people.  We don‚Äôt need to nerf them so they don‚Äôt matter, we just need more reasons to undock these guys and put them in real harms way. 
---
I actually thought im pretty much alone with the anti-haw pov. Glad to see other people here see the issue too.
---
Yeah, avoid Reddit like the Plague.
---
Only do it to actual retards, got it.
---
Tbh the press coverage from some of this stuff (Dyson sphere &amp; cyber planets pls) would exceed skin revenue bumps imo.
---
"Caps are needed to clear hostile caps" but if caps suck against subs, then why would I need to clear them with caps? I can clear them with subs.
---
there was 6 titans 20 supers before we jumped ready
---
&gt;General life pro tip, when you know there's a dread bomb waiting, and you have no fax support or scouts, or subcaps, or anything at all really, don't yolo in a super. Especially not 8 shitfit supers. 
---
I dunno, it certainly made the other side happy.
---
&gt;Or at least 6 shitfit supers and 2 reasonable ones, credit there at least. 
---
But there's the rub. Hollow victories are hollow.
---
Check out that heavy-handed title tho.
---
Bias in the media!
---
They aren't merely transports, the caps are engaged in active combat. Do you understand that a capital is different from a sub capital class space vessel? 
---
Try out abyssal stuff! The money can be good and it's really easy to get your feet wet from Jita. Try some tier2 filaments and go from there!
---
And he's not wrong. Dictor is easy, good dictor is hard.
---
Great review!
---
lol if you say so.
---
Great post!
---
Min-Amarr FW is mostly dead, with some interesting hotspots as described by OP.

Gal-Cal FW is dead dead.

---
I talked a lot of shit in local for that fight. But I legit feel bad after that BR. God damn. Sorry that shit happened to you SG/SC and friends.
---
Honestly after the ancil nerfs rorq tank isn‚Äôt the issue, it‚Äôs the fuckin cap umbrellas of certain groups that are logged on 24/7 cus they have 10-40k members. Like I can kill a bling fit rorq with 15 nagas and 3 curse in a very reasonable amount of time.
---
I think the best way to maybe combat this is to buff cyno jammers AGAIN, perhaps making them active as soon as you drop it, but maybe they can‚Äôt get reps for 30s-60s (and have a small enough sig that caps can‚Äôt lock it in that time)
---
I‚Äôd also probably nerf the amount of ore in anoms, I wouldn‚Äôt really want to make rorqs useless for mining cus I don‚Äôt think you should need 10 barges or whatever to make mining worth it over super ratting ... and because since CCP ~~fucked~~ changed moons I wouldn‚Äôt want to have to sit there for any longer than currently thinking if I should just quit this dumb game (not that I do, but I imagine the Indy people who mine alliance moons do) 
---
Just my 2 cents from a pvp perspective, I don‚Äôt actually own a rorq so maybe I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about but \o/
---
And this is actually why we will not see CCP ‚Äònerf capitals and Rorquals/mining into the ground‚Äô like many have suggested in this thread.  It‚Äôs actually what a large number of people, and subscribers, are enjoying in the game right now.  Make these activities not be rewarding enough, and not replace it with something equally as bad, and people will just not bother. 
---
It actually would not have been too awful, except that injecting years of SPs has facilitated many people embracing the current supers capital/Titans meta quicker than the game can absorb.  If everyone had to train for a year or so to fly a Rorqual, you would decrease the impact on the game.  
---
If CCP really wanted to put the screws to us hard, they would drastically change things and introduce even more powerful ships every year or two so everyone has to buy extractors and inject for the next greatest things.  
---
This would actually to be endgame of Eve in my opinion.
---
Its more or less what you just said.
---
According to OP all of eve is flying around in ravens killing keepstars and shit...
---
Protect us from what? We live in a station in lowsec and mostly just go roaming. 
---
Hy lied, TAPI died
---
Ive gotten decent solo frig pvp there tho, and there are plenty of hunters in recons/t3cs there if you're hunting them
---
Did he say undock?
---
Here's one from today https://zkillboard.com/kill/74871221/
---
I think a simple fix to rorquals would be to treat them like PI extractors, if they overlap too much the yield decreases. Like the siege module reduces the effectiveness of all other rorqs within say 20km, and each additional rorq within that overlap amplifies that effect.
---
Set a floor somewhere near that of a bonused hulk.
---
You could also reduce the capacity of wetus and increase the boundary of where a second wetu can be deployed. Making it impossible for rorqs to save more than say 3 drones and also making it riskier for rorqs to pile in together (by making it impossible for rorqs to deploy wetus near one another). Though this nerf would hurt smaller alliances and probably do little to hurt the large alliances.
---
Shout out to the 2 dead crucifier newbros, they died looting as all good horde should

A quarter inch dinner plate isn't good for much more than grinding.

---
I think you're talking like a mongoloid

'balance'

You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.

this was a fleet returning

That's your opinion, and there's nothing I can do, except point and laugh.

---
I wouldnt be against this, maybe minus the jump drive (perhaps.. unless they fit a module for it? Letting them choose between more damage as a slowboat or more projection with a jd)
---
As many as you can
---
(please don't)
---
Huh. I dunno cuz that‚Äôs not how it works for me
---
Go away goon we know you just don‚Äôt want your gatecamping titan nerfed
---
Look at the damage taken. He jumped in with the rest of the fleet. He took 18 million damage because they were deliberately holding him down hoping people would re-drop to save him. 
---
This is the result of a slope of poor enforcment.  This results in the current situation where GMs are telling players that F1-F8 smartbomb macros are fine, and Fighter Auto-Hotkey macros are fine.
---
All because little nitpicking edge case shitlords like you guys keep pushing it so you can 'do more elite pvp solo'
---
that'd be cool...I guess.
---
Wrong. It‚Äôs about velocity. Two inches is hell at 90mph. 
---
I appreciate the honourable mention dude but as I said in our local smack session, this is the nature of Eve and if you come to someone‚Äôs home system they will likely ship a lot of hate. Imagine it from our perspective, someone says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm bringing a Rapier and I can decloak and tackle them‚Äù, what do you say? ‚ÄúNo rapier, bring something that they can kill to keep up their morale‚Äù?
---
Don‚Äôt forget these things work both ways, you had a hateful roaming gang once and baited and killed me, I didn‚Äôt see you calling to hold back the cancer when I was getting ganked, you can‚Äôt expect anything different.

---
(Auraus was there in a Scimi)
---
I see what you mean, but the implication is that they serve and replace the unique point defense/dreadbomb comps that currently roam the fields, but with a more killable nature (not shitloads of ehp/tank like dreads)
---
Meh, we already Black Ops for that.
---
They don't need any buffs, except removing the scanres penalty from fitting a cloak.
---
Dammit, why when I'm on a 24h shift.... again?!
---
Also, why backstabbu etc - we blue with Test now?
---
Theyd be very hard to kill. Cap warfare iirc used to be the way to kill capitals, and imo should be the way to kill super marauders, but right now basically every ship has a neut or four
---
Well, I guess for pizza...Understandable.
---
Buff the dps to 2-3.5k dps?
---
&gt;The NC. Eagles and Init Machs were doing the depleted uranium tango while RA and Tri kept the fort paused. Weekend Warriors came in with a Nightmare fleet because they live two jumps away and have a solid, salt-of-the-earth lo-sec belief that everything in space should die, and they brought Iron Armada with them. At the same time, Shadow Cartel came by in Muninns because the more the merrier. Goons came up in a Jackdaw fleet because they saw things happening, and brawling is way more interesting than clearing the ochre out of the belts. GOTG came by in Cormorants because they saw things happening too, but they can't afford Jackdaws.
---
This is the most beautiful fleet comp summary I've seen in a long time.
---
alphastarpilot was in beast mode.
---
Lol. What did I do now? You fully know that I use nothing but resized game clients. I am literally the epitome of what a person can achieve in Eve without any third party assistance. As always, your krabber instincts just make hate the hunting folks. Try to be less hateful.
---
Plus, I'd be totally fine if a zero tolerance policy was enforced. But equally to Delve Rorquals and everyone else. That was the point. I am pretty sure Mar5hy would be equally happy if that happened too. But if the Rorquals can broadcast to save drones, why shouldn't Mar5hy broadcast to save 2 minutes per mass log in?
---
And then other random people just keep slamming into the pile after the initial crash
---
I bitched and moaned about the proper escalating order because I know what DHSJ can bring and that's what I want to fight. In fact the orthrus you were able to kill died because I chose to wait to come in. Unfortunately, others cannot put themselves before the fleet and give up a few kills in order to escalate a fight properly, and so there you see the blob we brought. 
---
Had that gang been pitted against the cancer that was brought to camp in my 3 man trio, none of would be talking about cancer blobs or local smack talk, it would've been a good fight
---
You certainly seem to think that EVE codebase is so simple that your totally unique idea is easy to implement.
---
Please. Stop.

I'm going to give this a "yikes dawg".

OP success
---
It sucks to be betrayed, but I'm glad you did it to us. TEST can handle it, we will be fine. More targets for all of us.
---
If only CCP had known about the 3:1 tendency of dwarf stars to any other star, when they started making the galaxy!
---
Lore-wise, it's not hard to add a bunch of weirdness through scanning and jump-bridges to signatures.
---
Bastion is a good pve tool, but for pvp they need to be more like a Heavy Assault Battleship. 
---
Give them a role for high application and great resists, but limited duration. Make them cap starved as a weakness. For nearly dread hull prices it makes no sense that a Pilgrim and decent cruiser can simply dunk them.
---
Your post has good intentions, but misses the mark mechanically.  
---
HAW Dreads:  HAW Dreads seem fine, but they invalidate what carriers should be.  The reason is multi-factor, but the guns are the prime enabler.  
---
Fighters: Fighers are fucky because they use missile application and are aimed at the 'anti-sub' role.  Fighters with Gun application rules I suspect would provide much better game-play (angular velocity lives matter) as well as allowing better tweaking between Damage and Tracking than what is possible with missiles.  
---
The carrier hull part falls under this, as I suspect 99% of people's issue with 'Carriers' is the fighters.  Is Dromi+Siren even an issue outside of 'solopwn supercarrier' style dunks?  It would just be Dromi+Dromi and Siren+Siren instead, giving the same net effect beyond 1 hull.
---
Cynos:  If cynos need looking at, so do wormholes.  This entire facet of the argument is predicated on ships traveling in space, and WH's are just an egregious offender if not moreso.
---
It‚Äôs not exact, you still need to watch the yield as you move the heads, put you shouldn‚Äôt worry about that. I just cluster my heads over the brightest patch and run the cycle.
---
If you have to play with it more than eyeballing it to get the yield you need, the site your ECU is on is going to not have the richness you want.
---
Great work man, just like you did with the Titan!
---
Dude, you wrote "we had a brawl" but in your tldr you wrote "we got dicked on" ... Like you expect us to know who you are as which side you're on. Please clarify which side you're talking about
---
Would pay $60 for EVE Offline.
---
&gt;anyone who roams your renter space will know that you have as many and more bots than plenty of other areas in eve.
---
Friend, just because people leave their anoms when you come into system, doesn't mean they are bots.
---
If you are looking for fights, WTF are you doing in renter lamds, to begin with?
---
No punches pulled.
---
Funny this argument falls on the other side of the coin when people talk about the ratters that are totally always bots.
---
Yes please.
---
Marauders sole existence right now is because of acceleration gates and highsec stopping better ships from being used.
---
People arnt on at 6am when I get off work etc. Also they answered, so guess it worked?

Just coming back to EVE. Why the Nestors?
---
Oh, things became so cheap now.
---
1) REMOVE HAW WEAPONRY
---
2) Make fighters unable to apply to sub capital ships
---
3) Remove jump fatigue entirely
---
4) make JDC5 titan/super jump range only 2 light years, 
---
5) make titan/blops bridge range 10 light year, 
---
6) make carrier/dread/fax range 4 light year.
---
7) remove panic module from rorqual, allow them to fit only buffer, no CASB/CSB
---
More like cunt poster who is only in charge of giving my one eyed yogurt slinger a tongue bath on the reg.

You're not wrong, but this isn't the time or the place...

That's a business model that never worked, for anyone.
---
Rapid lights
---
They have a proper place for people who complain about capitals and rorquals. It‚Äôs called highsec.  Don‚Äôt want to get dropped on by caps, supers or Titans? Don‚Äôt blindly go invading their space without a proper plan in placeüòÇ  You can escape from their drops if you‚Äôre not a complete moron and put yourself into a bad scenario. Small Gangs can kill solo droppers quite easily, just requires competence and a solid fleet comp. You cant  just throw a bunch of f1 monkeys into the cauldron, and expect positive results.  Stop whining for an easy mode, and get good. 
---
You're a God. I'm on mobile and could barely read it at even max brightness.
---
Absolutely. The best way to get burnt out on Eve is to spend tons of your game time doing un-fun activities just to plex your account. ...but that‚Äôs just my opinion.  
---
Tri still exists?
---
I was saying that excusing his obvious and explicit use of a questionable tool for a questionable purpose like 'logging in my camping army' is as dangerous as overlooking other obvious examples, like the rorquals you mention.
---
Your hate boner for my hard mid-line stance truth keeps blinding you.  From what you have said in past posts, you have krabbed harder than I ever have or will.
---
me, currently winning eve for a few years now:
---
They removed jump fatigue??? Not that it was particularly fun nor engaging but it did its job... No wonder y'all are having issues.
---
And yes I remember the gigantic shitshow when it was introduced.
---
I'll give you some love :x

The playerbase will break the system, just like the previous two iterations.  
---
"It's a bot!" spammers will be ready in minutes.

Mostly its just the burn the scorpion name is because of the "tail" it has. It feels like how you would expect lava in your mouth to feel. Considering it's the 2nd (third if you count pepper x as hottest) hottest pepper in the world. That thing would make PGL sweat more than the Phrase "200+ Goon Supers in Eso" and probably require someone with a low pepper tolerance to get an IV and stay extremely close to a toilet.
---
Yes
---
Not this shit
---
What?
---
Sure
---
No
---
Those were likely in the cargo holds of the titan and supercarrier. They can be used to refit the supers in space.

Still, you already know that most of eve can't do that these days. Most of wh space can't utilize a dread blob.

I was half expecting to see a picture of Ken Moen. 
---
Blaster atrons, like most Gallente ships when blaster fit, are designed to get close and facerape the enemy. It just so happens that tracking is also a thing and Atrons are very fast.

This this this...

5000000mn.

Oh make sense, so they had a counterdrop big enough to stop legacy superfleet then ?

We make fun of our director's incestual tendencies. Also, kick WECU.

Yea, but I play on tranq, just thought it was funny to see.
---
May Allah forgive you, brony degenerate.
---
Eve is very sensitive to dropped packets and will drop sockets very fast if that is going on.  
---
It may be worth checking to see if you are having issues with the quality of your internet.

you'll have to ask them~

Not great as destroyers go, but it has LASERS so it is best

That‚Äôs our secret, Cap, we always exist.

I am curious as to what makes the sub vs cap argument different than one where we replace sub with frigate and cap with Battleship?

EMS?

Good call on learning German like that. Immersion, even in small amounts, is amazingly good for learning a language.
---
No wonder you're always on reddit always having to justify yourself. You can't comprehend anything lol.
---
T1 ships have been near insurance parity for fucking 9+ years, it is nothing new.  It was like 2008 ish? they changed the insurance system because ship fraud was keeping mineral prices down.
---
What has changed, and everyone misses the ball on this, is Production Speed.  In the past, even with 2isk trit or whatever, the bottleneck was build slots.  Citadels brought infinite slots, infinite storage, and 2x build speed, in one neat little package.

Can you screenshot your settings please?

A) the dude you killed may have set a kill right on you.
---
B) if you are enlisted in facwar, you can be shot by the enemy no matter the space.
---
C) if you had any criminal activity you can be shot for a period of time.
---
Any of these make sense?
---
Killrights, suspect timer, war target, any other details?
---
&gt;A) the dude you killed may have set a kill right on you.
---
How does that work?
---
&gt;B) if you are enlisted in facwar, you can be shot by the enemy no matter the space.

Are you auto-enlisted, because I don't remember signing up for anything...
---
&gt;C) if you had any criminal activity you can be shot for a period of time.
---
No, I'm new and I've only ever killed one person and it was in Null a week ago.
---
I think you just described every nullsec alliance in the game.

Now Tau must justify to mother imperium?

&gt;Killrights

Idk how they work...

Nope

Is this you? Kalon Devito, of Eve University? And the entire Ivy League alliance is at war with RIOT, including the guy who shot you.
---
If you're part of a Corp or Alliance that is at war, anyone you are at war with can shoot you, and vice versa.
---
Ohhh, I'm retarded.
---
Ok, describe your day. Because what you told us tells us jack
---
Apparently it's cause my clan's at war with his...
---
Is there a way to opt out of war?
---
That explains alot...
---
&gt;now you have something else in the belt to shoot at
---
That sounds pretty good. Let's do it.
---
Drop corp. You'll revert to an NPC corp, and those can't be wardec'd.
---
Or just tough it out. You joined Eve University (which is a smart move, they'll teach you the game). And part of playing the game is dealing with PvP.
---
I pretty much assume at this point that if they aren't banned, then either they aren't bots, can't be proven through objective data to be bots, or CCP (like other game devs) are working on a mass solution so they don't waste energy trying to keep ahead of an intractable problem for which there is no good solution at present.
---
The current trend of players thinking they are saving the game from them or some dumb shit is pretty hilarious though.
---
You can see his fit, right? What kind of PVP build could beat it as an alpha? I'm not gonna buy another thorax if this guy's just gonna blow it up again...

Dude, you me and Mar5hy all agree on that we'd prefer CCP to fully enforce their rules. So wtf are you still babbling about? But if those Rorqs can broadcast, so should Mar5hy. That's not "excusing" anything. That's just arguing against double standards.
---
&gt; Your hate boner for my hard mid-line
---
Your stance is not mid-line. You are part of the culture who has helped CCP to stupify this game and eventually kill it. You and I obviously play the game for different reasons. You might be right if you mean I made more money than you. But even my moneymaking is based on skill, creativity, innovation, excitement. These are the things that literally distinguish from a game like Farmville. And that's what kept many playing the game for years. Yet you puke hatred upon people preferring that playstyle for being "elite pvp" at every given chance. Yet I am the one with an irrational hate boner.
---
By being among people converting "elite pvp" into an insult you do more damage to Eve than any of these broadcasters did lol. That's a cultural move invented by mega krab empire leadership vs. entities like PL. Those people don't care about you, Eve or its modes of PvP. They care about their IRL pockets, kickstarters, twitch revenues, RMT. Or they care about the sense of self-worth they derive from getting their cock sucked all the time in a video game. The people who think they are insulting someone with "elite pvp" are as dumb as the people who think they are doing the same by "SJW" lmao.

But Test only lost 5 sabres and a malediction... bigthonk.jpg

**PEE IS STORED IN THE BALLS**
---
Username checks out - Gr√º√üe gehen raus o7
---
You can't see his fit... You can only see the ship and guns he used to kill you. And if you're part of a Corp / Alliance at war, then it's expected your 'mates will help protect each other. So start asking in Channels what you can do to help. Maybe there's a bunch of them interested in missions or mining or whatever you are interested in doing, and then you'll stay alive longer as a group. Or maybe you can get groups together in cheap ships and go on the offensive.
---
&gt; Take chances, make mistakes, and get messy!
---
I know it's kinda low hanging deceptive fruit but B-R5RB lol
---
As someone who's about to start producing things, this is nice!
---
Ah, that makes sense. Would he have known where I was somehow or could it have been random?
---
I remember when it was PL/NC. Nice to see Horde filled that gap
---
&gt;Any Amarr ships that are good?
---
You can run a geddon as a 'poor mans rattlesnake' by fitting it with 5 cruises, 2 drone range extenders and flights of appropriate drones. It's not a particularly *good* option but if what you're trained for is amarr battleships it remains an option.
---
False equivalence; you have to put a dumb pilot in a blinged boat in order to compensate for the fact that the blinged boat gives pilots a huge advantage.
---
But a fair comparison pits two equal pilots against each other; the one with bling wins.
---
  As a neighbor of Test and the whole of Legacy CO who use/abuse the shit out of this mechanic, we fully support and endorse this move.
---
  The OP nature of capitals and supers are killing this game.  
---
  The days of individual pilot skill are over and everything always boils down to cyno up in come the supers/titans.
---
It says yc117
---
Dont feel bad, they have their uses and technically almost everything is viable... even if it's not the most insanely optimal thing out there.
---
I can‚Äôt wait for Supertitans
---
shit happens, dont join corps that are at war, you will never win vs the ppl who camp systems to catch targets like you.  
---
if you have 2-5 friends going with you, you may stand a chance, as a skilled omega pilot in a fleet
---
tl;dr, shit happens, ur gonna get killed, get a new ship and go back to what you were doing. dont undock in anything you cant afford to lose  
---
That is your Salt Silo in every station... the more you get Salt from other players the more it fills up..
---
I have never gated a Ferox fleet so fast in my life. Got in system and warped just as the Titan died.   
---
Gf dudes.
---
His entire Alliance is at war with your entire Alliance. And there are a lot of folks at war with Eve Uni / Ivy League b/c they're very popular. It's just a matter of time before someone will come across someone else.
---
And since Local chat is such an amazing source of free intel... They can see your name pop up with a blinking "this is a war target" marker next to it. Then it's just a matter of hunting you down. Be sure not to leave your ships named "Kalon Devito's Thorax" cus then it's super easy to track you down.
---
Alright, makes sense. I think I'll be doing some lvl 2 missions in a destroyer for now so I don't lose a cruiser again. In a little bit I'll have level 5 drones so I can effectively fly a vexor, which apparently can actually kill frigates.
---
Damn you right.
---
there are various ways to find a ship in space. you being a new player, i doubt he needed much to go on, and just d-scanned (fine tuning how many AU away you were) and then warping to whatever site was at that AU range
---
The problem is risk-free spamming of titans (within uncontested super umbrellas) and the fact that titans+fax can only be beaten my more titans+fax (never by dreads, you'll crash the server before you break gsf's fax reps on a titan). 
---
These are both a consequence of faxes making titans in-practice immune to dreadbombs unless the pilot/FC severely fucks up. 
---
You could balance this out by making faxes cost 6-8bil each while retaining dread prices at current levels; it'd become very expensive to mass rep your titans, so you'd probably lose the isk war against a drop even if you won the on-field battle. 
---
In general, though, cost balancing isn't a great strategy. If you nerfed rorqs it'd just make faxes cost more, but dreads as well, making any potential dreadbomb much more risky and expensive for the attacker. 
---
Caps in wormholes are absolute cancer though. At least they can't be cyno'd I guess. 
---
Then again, this is what Eve Uni is for... to teach you stuff like this. Rather than getting pointers from a bunch of random Redditors, get back in game and let your teachers teach. =)
---
I wonder if gates get destroyed k-space becomes j-space or does it?
---
Hi PGL
---
I will, I will. They've been pretty helpful for things like fitting and mission advice.
---
that's called a meme, you retard
---
level 4 Amarr most important thing is to run missions for agents that offer missions where the enemy is weak to EM/TH since lasers are your only option (geddon mission running is bad idea). 
---
Use an Apoc with a MJD and tacyon or  a MWD and pulses, both require kiting but with the range bonus on the Apoc you can snipe with pulse or hit in close range and let drones take care of the annoying frigs.
---
If you love lasers but want to branch out more a Nightmare is a kickass mission ship if properly fit and flown, but it requires an enormous amount of SP.
---
I feel like putting the income into player's hands instead of alliance hands is still a better system even if it causes less fights.
---
NC complaining about getting cap blobbed after years of cap blobbing near uncontested with PL lol
---
this will have 0 effect against pvp pilots out to kill people, skills matter a lot in this game. so when you get to fly those drones etc etc, someone flying the same ship as you could have "implants" worth 3 billion, giving then 30-40% bonuses, then their skills probably doubling or tripling the damage, speed, tank etc on their own ship. 
---
If you are a shootable target, and someone decides to shoot you, they have decided that they can win, before the fight begins (unless for some reason another alpha starts on you)
---
&gt;a negligible amount of isk is even worse
---
Its ironic you say this about a group of people that regularly mine more in delve then the rest of the game put together.
---
You raise a good  point, that's something we need to fix.
---
Delete fax
---
That makes sense. I think I'm going back to wormhole exploring for a bit.
---
1 the only people who like being in theta comms are theta  
---
2 a few systems that everyone insists on staying in are crowded, the rest are wide fucking open.  
---
3 That fc is one person trying to get intel on more than 30,000 people using almost 100 accounts, but they only have 2 eyes and two hands so thousands of us fall through the cracks every hour, and even when they try to drop it regularly doesn't work out for them.
---
4 well yeah its eve
---
5 it does seemed to have served the OP's purpose.  
---
SVs attempts at Stukas have been interesting to say it nicely
---
Marauders are fine. They would be overpowered if too much cheaper, we have this discussion every month. We literally just got an insane anti-cap capable ship line. The issue is cap balance and application not lack of ships to kill them. 
---
Step 3: Introduce T2 Titans
---
No one says that.
---
damn show me on the doll where the goons touched you?  
---
?? It's for fast aligns. Note the istab and t1 hyper rigs; this is a pretty solid cheap krab fit. 
---
I think Init and PH were also shooting each other. Hence the confusion.
---
You shut your w**** mouth, Coercers are glorious, even if you were to fit them with autocannons.  :D
---
[deleted]
---
They don't though and you shouldn't be in a situation where you can be neuted 99% of the time. They are an mjd kitting platform with an emergency bastion mod for when you're fucked and/or can make use of it when there is not risk to use it. Regardless most of the marauders can absolutely deal with a lot of cap pressure because they should usually be injector or asb fit unless they're a paladin in which case it's a paladin.  
---
Oh yeah I saw that bit haha, just seems funny that something meant for the Chinese server was on tranquility. Upon clicking on it, it looks like some blueprint that only requires the ishtar as an input and it outputs that chinese ship.
---
&gt;The only advantage they get is an insane local tank which is completely irrelevant in fleet fights
---
Except the most important bonus a marauder gets is the mjd bonus 
---
To each their own, I guess, doing npc missions requires a decent amount of gameplay without actually doing anything interactive -  doing npc missions would bore me to death. I just hunt and kill things and sell the loot. However, much like in RL, not everyone can hunt or it wont work.
---
Because that‚Äôs exactly what the meta needs, a sub cap doing 3.5k dps.
---
A cruiser sized mwd is not going to do shit on a super.
---
but comes online instantly, yep.
---
that's kinda sad, sorry
---
All I see is your opinion, spread among a few bold faced lies.  How much effort do you expect me to expel in trying to prove the obvious here?  
---
It doesn't really matter how many actual factual numbers I use, and I could include full color slides and a power point, none of that will matter as you'll simply continue to try and imply your lies are the truth.
---
Seems like more than a few people realize you're dumb here on this very forum.
---
And also, there are more than 1 or 2 "real battles" a month. Have you seen the BRs coming from the J100820 wormhole, J104859, J164430? No they are not 100B Min TiDi snorefasts - rather low or NO TiDi, 20-50b, 30 v 30, fights where  *everyone* enjoys themselves. Even a recent fight against TDSIN wasn't ~terrible~. These fights happened outside of capital umbrellas and factions that can flash form 100+ nerds.
---
Honestly if you crusaded for that, I'd support you all the way, FWIW.
---
I wasn't trying to be comprehensive, but thanks for adding careful nuance to the discussion!
---
And as for CCP's glacial pace, I guess they are from Iceland...
---
Delete every titan and replace it with equivalent racial destroyer. 
---
The fact that people own supers without their own support available amazes me, and its not just 1, a single fucking guy did it right.
---
Caps in wormholes are fucking great. Mass limits the amount of support they can bring, and they're very easy to counter in a small gang scenario when you're not getting a supercap hammer dropped on you.
---
It's good to be remembered.  
---
Tear storage? 
---
Yeah, your eye just slides right over it.
---
I love them :)
---
&gt; For rorqs, either remove panic or remove their outrageous local tank 
---
Rorquals still die even with the outrageous local tank don't they? Now lets call Bombers Bar to verify this statement!
---
&gt;Also I honestly think excavators were a tremendous mistake, as they have completely eclipsed exhumers. 
---
I guess they designed it to be better than exhumers. Still excavs can be easily destroyed or stolen!  
---
&gt;I think the game would be a lot more healthy if rorqs provided incredibly strong (yes, even stronger) bonuses to barges/exhumers rather than being afk solo monsters that can be run 20 at a time. 
---
Spodbrains will still use 20 exhumers with stronger boost. Because CCP will not nerf the rorqual completely. They will either remove panic or make rorqual a booster like you mentioned. If it becomes a booster, 20 exhumers get to live until the umbrella arrives! Deep down you know CCP wont remove panic and make rorqual into a mega non-mining booster ship! They may do either one! 
---
progodlegend:DO NOT LEAK THE FORUM POST (wink wink)
---
You better :D
---
another bad day to be a dino it seems
---
There are tags that will drop from lowsec rats that you can turn in at DED and CONCORD stations in lowsec.  Alternatively, you can just buy the tags rather than farm for them.  They are always up for sale at the same stations where you turn them in.
---
You could not be farther from the truth in regard to Iran.  Frigates and Cruisers are not going to wreak havok on US ships.  That is laughable.  You do know that the US also use Frigates and Cruisers?  And the only thing being used that is larger is Aircraft Carriers.  But the Submarine force would have the Iranian navy crippled almost immediately if fighting were to break out.
---
The reason that the US doesn't just sail a carrier fleet into the Straight of Hormuz is....oh wait, they already do pretty often.  How else do you think they get into the Persian Gulf?
---
Dreads are easy to counter in a small gang scenario when they leave their own hole. The cancer begins when they don't. That aside though delete fax and I don't really mind caps in wormholes that much. Rorqs are obnoxious but they don't feel as aids as they used to be with the asb nerfs and the trig ship addition. 
---
Imo if you're a pure pvp player, I dont see a way you can pay for subs for even one of your accounts. You'd have to get into krabbing, but from your post, you dont seem like that kind of player
---
Seriously Winmatar is a joke. I feel bad for any other newbros that get suckerd into joining them.
---
Is PGL a Stain guy alt? Cause this is some colossal shitposting.
---
1st genuine new superpower contender....rofl
---
Basically everyone EXCEPT test lol.
---
Oath I have 2 faxs characters, almost a third with 10 faxs of my own let alone alliance cache 
---
Wait no T3 carriers :O I am ashamed of you CCP!
---
&gt;I have never in my life felt a depression this deep
---
it's not gonna last forever trust me
---
This is what happens when people who don't know how to fly caps get supers.
---
They don't drop caps in catch btw
---
We're free spirits, man. You tell us not to do a thing, and we're gonna do the thing. We can't help it.
---
who gives a fuck about what an argumentative box headed manlet has to say
---
I may no longer be in horde but that man has given me some fucking awesome fleets.
---
UI is adapted for Chinese bots
---
Winmatar is "special" because they mass invite the newbro NPC corps which despite being told (repeatedly) that its a bad idea, Murder decided "I know what I'm doing". Then said newbros were yelled out when they had no idea wtf they were doing, you can thank Aslon for that. During my time in Winmatar there was MAYBE 5 pilots that knew wtf they were doing. Seriously massive waste of time joining that space faring garbage fire. Hope no more newbros join them.
---
So you‚Äôre saying that if you lose badly enough it doesn‚Äôt count?
---
It's not worth it your time...
---
There's something fucky about how the heatmap updates when you reset extractor heads. If you leave them in the same place, the estimated output will be more overestimated than usual. Not 100% how the math works behind it or anything.
---
Half of Darth Maul is at the bottom.
---
If you are into FC'ing some null blocs pay their FC's. If you want decent income from pvp WH's are typically pretty good dependent on your skill and ability to not die. Same with null. Both of which doesn't matter with sec status.
---
It's the PGL Effect. It's not a terrible idea, he just promotes it in the fucking douchiest way possible. It's like at Vegas. Technically, the stuff he was saying wasn't wrong, but he came off as such an insufferable twat that I tried to screen his sobriety before going into a roundtable or keynote. While I'd love to get rid of MWD's off Sirens, remove HAW's off Titans (NSA's off supers would be fucking nice too), and some of the other stuff he mentions, it comes across as "IM THE MAN, I CAN DO THIS, CCP WILL HAVE TO LISTEN TO ME AND NOT IGNORE ME"
---
A couple of tips:
---
Have local in a separate window, this way you can always see who is in the system with you. If someone enters and their name is flashing, aline away and stay clear of them.
---
If you don't know yet, stay away from Jita(the biggest market hub in the game), it will be full of war tatgets. Make a second Caldari character and place it at Jita 4-4. This way you can buy stuff, move it to a safe system and pick it up on your main later.
---
If you are in a big alliance like eve-Uni go on as many fleets as possible. When you feel like you have tried everything they do a few times and you know what you like, it will be time to move to a small alliance. One that has fewer wars and will teach you more about one subject, instead of eve-Uni's a little bit of everything.
---
Use Intel, your alliance will have a way to communicate where bad guys are. LEARN TO USE IT ASAP!
---
LOL
---
Okay, thanks! I'm in Eve Uni, so I'll try fleets.
---
El'Miner is [this](https://zkillboard.com/kill/29682967/) kill.
---
Basically, the whole thing is a meme. Shit fit skiff, black legion dropped blops on just this one skiff. Now, people link it to their friends as a "rick roll". In EVE (just assuming you know nothing), you can link something in chat like a hyperlink on reddit. So you edit the text to make it look like something interesting (like, say, the mittani losing a molok or something), and it is actually el'miner.
---
I love them too, got one of my rare kills in one a few days ago.
---
So basically, PGL fucked up in Geminate and that means the game is imbalanced?
---
Mad. Lad.
---
Probably some hurt pride and quiet reflection now.
---
I like using a typhoon for fun and a Rattlesnake for serious grind.
---
They are also excellent in pvp
---
Emperor God Trump is the boss... you must be new
---
You flaunt your shit often enough people get pissed and plan counter drops
---
That's a bar that entities like Intrepid Crossing and Against ALL Authorities still cross, too. Not a precisely high one, my friend.
---
You found Tara Reids new account
---
I see no supers on that kill. It's like complaining your battleship died to battleships 
---
Also deprecated slang, that's got to be hard for new players who don't even get context of when the terms are used to help them. Slowcats aren't a thing anymore, but still gets referenced occasionally, Cross refitting isn't a thing, a lot of pre-phobe concepts etc.
---
or just raise the damage caps alltogether?
---
I'm not, if people wanna yolo their ratting/shit fit supers with no support, or coordination, they deserve to be laughed at. Serves them right imo. You could almost call it karma....
---
I'll actually disagree with you there.  
---
Not only is there plenty of transferable knowledge for supers/titans in the form of other capital ships, there is no excuse for not even trying to think ahead.
---
"What if i jump instead of bridge? no problem, make sure to have a tank fit (he did), make sure to have fuel and a cyno fit so I can have the hardest of rescue cyno's possible."  
---
I don't disagree with everything you said, but the learned lessons and school of hardknocks shit works for like, roaming in cruisers. Not an asset that costs so much, takes so much to build, and is worth so much strategically. Somethings you simply need to think about before running headlong into situations, yeh?
---
Just write "Happy Birthday Fawlty7" for example when someone mentions him or TIKLE leadership. I still don't fucking know why, but this seems to be kind of funny to a lot of people. I once asked him where that came from but he did not respond. So I wished him a nice birthday and a safe flight and gtfo'ed.
---
Pls also cover why shitadels are wack
---
&gt;dropping supers on subs
---
  &gt;They finally get counter dropped
---
  &gt;**"AgAiNsT PeOpLe EvErYoNe KnOwS CaN't FiGhT BaCk"**
---
  Really?...
---
Sometimes the shit talking gets so mixed up with discussing the game mechanics you can't sort anything out, and wind up with shit mechanics.
---
I am always 5-7 days off. I feel your pain in general, but not the entirety of it.
---
Literally everything. Do you even play the game or do you just huff spod all day?
---
Battleships won't apply *at all* to a frig fleet shooting at them, while caps can dick literally everything except for MWDing frigates. *And* battleships require a titan bridge and can't jump in/out at will.
---
Additionally, you're infinitely more likely to see battlecruisers, command ships, or HACs fighting battleship fleets than you are to see a frigate ball fighting a Mach fleet... But caps don't have anything like battlecruisers, command ships, or HACs to fight against them. If you want to kill caps, your only option is to bring *more* caps.

From what I've heard, Eve does have something like this but only as a punishment for an account. The one person who said they got it, said they got it after spamming the same web link in multiple systems while traveling from jita to somewhere. This was however a few years ago with the old chat system.
---
Hy wanto pretended TEST was a public street and just did what comes naturally to him
---
Yeah, it kinda does
---
Na, you are wrong... we just need a special [stick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_ship)! It should be the cloacky t3 bc that can do dd-like damage while ramming the target (while no resistences or damage cap will safe the target)! You have to pilot this ship manual into the target and of course after exploding while screaming you will die and loose skillpoints. But as there are enough skillpoints to inject you can do it like 24/7 and it will be a sandbox .... just like after a heavy rain (no structures, no supers nor titans ...because they will all fall against the mighty army of the [defenders of our eve](https://giphy.com/gifs/rammstein-richard-kruspe-engel-vo1GiarHqpOJq/fullscreen) ... (or just start hiding)
---
99.9% so you got these numbers the same place CCP did with 260mil ticks.. but sadly no amount of changes can fix the player base of people whining about losing pixels in a video game. Most FCs egos get hurt if they lose and the the oh my kb stat players won't join that FCs fleets. The games become ether couter or don't fight online. 
---
Sadly we can't go back in time to when people would fight for fun.

I understand that

Slasher Navy Issue

ahh ye, you are absolutely right. Though since RonUSMC and Hedliner (as well as other pro-north) are regularly there, as a listener you soon realize that most have their own narrative. As long as you get all the narratives or at least most of them, you get a fair representation of the political landscape in eve.
---
When it comes to the HK eviction, I think the narrative on reddit was much more propaganda than the execution. It might be blobbing with the fact that it was more easy than presented by init. Though, it was widely accepted that it would not be possible to evict a strong WH alliance as HK (with the intended backing from other WH groups) from their own system, until init proved it wrong... They made trillions, if it was obvious and easy, why noone else did it beforehand?
---
Sounds like I should try solo frig PvP down there
---
I feel obliged to cri over this reddit post.
---
There are already hotkeys for this, no reason to make an extra macro
---
I bet you almost stroked out trying to compile all the unfunny into a single comment.
---
Dont forget the 1 Scourge dread that got tackled after he jumped in the Other system and jumped back to finish the Rorqual 
---
Are you a betting man?
---
Hi krothesis how are you 
---
Afaik anything they performs an input that is not the player is prohibited.
---
RIP Moros 
---
It's just a few Grath whiteknights trying to defend your e-honour, which kinda perplexes me. 
---
Tfw Eve players are what nerds consider nerds
---
What happened to Ice Fire Warriors? I remember them from back in... 2009?
---
Because it‚Äôs use is for 10/10‚Äôs and some people use it for wormhole ratting for whatever reason. Looks like the marausers were designed to do this since they are so.. vulnerable when they use that  ‚Äúdrop caps on me‚Äù module.
---
&gt;Outrageous weekly anchorage fees charged as ISK sink? So you gotta put taxes on it to pay for it and it has to be well used to be maintainable?
---
honestly, I haven't thought about that. it makes sense in empire. Though in nullsec, it makes less sense, as the "all ruled by players" idea would be broken.
---
In my opinion though, the nullsec spam is less of a problem, since, if you own military supremency you can just slay the structures with few caps if undefended
---
A whole group of drifters? Wormhole people are rich enough in my opinion. A fleet of drifters would just be another method to make a shitton of isk in a very short time.
---
"I am especially looking for any fights in which capitals were used, especially against OUR subcaps. [...]"
---
Not mentioning that you guys are turbodunking nerds who tackle your rorqs with supers as well (and sometimes feed your ratting supers to a dreadbomb there, next time you're gonna post about dreads being OP in Anti-Cap? GG dude, learn to lose and not cry about every single loss that you take because of making bad decisions!)
---
Yes but I want to have one that does them all simultaneously with one button press
---
(Ingame)
---
It's because I'm right
---
The thing is jackdaws are an excellent way to engage many types of fleet and they can totally neuter stuka fleets. One of the only fleet types Jackdaws actually don't trade that well against is corms.
---
Flying through black rise plenty of times the past month, can confirm. Except Tama on the highsec Gate....
---
I second this petition.  This post made me sad.
---
You could make jump delay time similar to lock time, in that a fleet of cruisers could lock onto the remote cyno to bridge to it in a matter of seconds, but caps and supers need 45s to lock onto the remote cyno and jump. That could work....
---
I hate feedback on my vids. Eve players are swine and are incapable of appreciating refined culture.
---
They allow insta re-fitting, unlike a mobile depot which has a spin up time
---
Don't forget to remove local, stop selling skill extractors, delete PANIC, make nullsec anoms just like wormhole anoms, and buff cyno inhibs. :-)
---
And yet half the time we roam to Catch we get told in local that everyone is in Impass
---
As much as I don‚Äôt like test , snuff is even worth , they would prob. Backstab their mothers to get a kill.. 
---
Give me your happy meal toy.
---
I get ~5 solo frigate fights on any day of the week in an hour or two of roaming in Minmatar FW space. Ofc the best way to boost those numbers is to fly something engage-able like a T1 frigate. 
---
no lol, read my response below
---
Always getting good fights from Schneckt. Love that guys
---
If i ever look for a new corp, i'll probably apply there.
---
All hail the booze
---
There is only one way to solve eve. Swap lowsec and nullsec.
---
and what do NON supercaps do? Standard carriers are useless if they cant apply to subcaps (cruiser and up) , as they cant field anticap fighters 
---
and then strap engines to the planet, PA style! 
---
Alpha became one of my favorite fcs with very few fleets. Great guy to fly with.
---
Your name makes this even better. Made my morning. Thx! 
---
they can do that, most of the bonuses come from triage anyway. Not most effective but certainly possible.
---
Happy cake day. And yeah, I'm usually the best, but certainly not at Eve.
---
Make supers/titans not able to lock subcaps, thank you.
---
imagine rorq saves in delve if that where to be still a thing 
---
Well keep going. o7
---
they shud tie activity and structures into sov, aka you crab alot and you have some refineries there? its yours my friend, aslong as you are the only alliance crabbing there, otherwise you have to contest it by outcrabbing the others or murdering there stuff 
---
Snake eater 
---
No, you didn't. I refuted your argument of "fighting on your own terms" and you started accusing me of dropping caps.

Alternatively, remove cynos from ships. Keep covert cynos as mobile, but for big stuff they gotta use cyno structures or just gate it.

for experimental reasons show me.. like share the URLS / snippets of wisdom etc.. honestly i hear that a lot at times in eve "hah, dude is shit fit, he should know.." and i go "i'll stop you right there at the word should... where is the public vs common knowledge stored?"
---
I couldn't parse that... i mean i get the posture you're taking but dear god you're giving me flash backs to GME comms in horde... erggh.. make the noises stop...

Lost my mach but really enjoyed doing a null brawl again 
---
un-ironically an amazing post
---
swarms of ospreys on a HS astra trying to outrep feroxes sounds fun, im down 
---
Yeah you can find us (sba) in sahtogas and aset. Aset is overall one of the most active systems in the warzone. Should be on the initial map? 
---
wormholes get special sauce rules by "not being empire" and thus not conforming by its rules (wich also means carriers are still the "old" in wh's, wich is fine as they arent a huge asset there and risky to move) 
---
Anything that does together what multiple keys do independently is forbidden and bannable.

Well it depends on how good you are and how blingy your targets are .. doubt u can sub a account from killing t1 frigates but if you blops blingy ratter sure.
---
Sec status , you can buy tags to fix your sec status in concord stations or farm the taxs in lowsec which will prob. Tag ages 
---
I would say it depends on the targets , fw t1 frigates no , blingy ratter in botting space sure 
---
this is what happens if you dont have fax or subcaps on grid 
---
I'm not sure if it can still be done, but years ago I did L4s in dessies. They're pretty powerful for their skill requirement.
---
500 plex goes for about 1.8b, VNI ratting realistically gives you 50 to 55m per hour, Rorq probably some 120m per hour, carrier ratting some 100ish m per hour, you do the math.
---
Personally I have 4 accounts and depending on how I feel that month, I plex anywhere from 1 to 4 accounts, lately it's been 4 without all that much effort.

Remove cyno from the game. Simple solution.

I think honestly this is one of the boldest fuck you eve moments in the game history .. the audacity of not only kicking horde out of a system that tbh was a ‚Äúis it really worth it?‚Äù Question to then taking a dump on their turf with another big fuck you space sand castle .. just classic eve move imho.

I mean.... When does he not?
---
As a third party pirate I would like to say you're doing gods work. Either fix the fucking capitals or banish that cancer to null sec and don't let them come to low sec any more. We are sick of seeing them and we shouldn't have to deal with fat dick waving gay lords from null wishing to flex on people incapable of even beginning to fight them.

shield nyxes are ratting boats, if you drop on dreads w/ that its your own darn fault that you die

Yeah that's not how that works.  You need time for the defenders to get on grid.

Current citadel mechanics are mostly fine... if you just delete all small citadels.

If you want a structure, plant an 8b fort, not an 800m isk azbel.
---
Speak for youeself.
---
no wtf i wanted to eat it
---
PL and NC. did not show for a fort kill. We were doing "other things" and picked this opportunity for a good fight. 
---
...and it was a great fight. One of the best I've had in a while. 
---
I figured the 7.5 bil suicide mino was a meme. But I commend INIT for trying, at least.

Wasn't mine sadly. Wish it was, my board could use a boost lol.

I've never been of the opinion that someones _home system_, regardless of the security of that space, should be easy to fight in. Defenders, especially in wormholes, need all the advantages they can get.

The failure here isn't tech it's governance. The only antibotting security that exists currently is we report and they confirm as you describe. That "security" is mom and pop crap from 20 years ago. Nobody handles security this way in 2019. There are hundreds automated anti injection detection and rejection programs that they can choose from to license and install to handle all this automatically. Every single one of them more efficient and cheaper than the 2 or 3 people they currently have doing the same work with pencils on kleenex. It's time to step into at least 2012 and get some automation going. Hell if nothing else they can send the Russians a few bottles of vodka to get a copy of their social media bots which would be a huge step forward. 
---
prove it wasn't a bot piloting the rorq
---
I remember seeing a footage where the capsuleer used either a ship or a cargo scanner on an Overseer battleship in a Serpentis DED site, and the result showed him the Deadspace MWD on the enemy ship. Does this still work ? And is it really useful to take a midslot for that ?
---
Thanks !

He was resisting, chatting and trying to wetu his drones.

"  but are these simple macros legal? " No, just input broadcasting anything that allows you to reduce the  number of clicks to do something outside the built in hotkeys is against the rules and bannable.
---
I really don't like the bulk of battleships. To my delight the Tech 3 cruisers also work pretty well in level 4 missions. I love my Legion.
---
Sir, you deserve cookie!
---
Yeah it's almost as if there were other balance factors that were impacting player count.
---
Where did you get this idea that they apply perfectly? And maybe because the guys in the little fighters are better pilots?
---
Yes let me trade lokis for dromis and sirens, sounds like a great trade.
---
Not every... But most. 
---
You're not the only alliance in the game
---
They apply good because they are cruiser size drone using frigate weapons , bad against subs if they use torps and blaster :p and you use multiple tracking modules 
---
Thanks.
---
Increase Zitadel hp but remove damage cap / arithmetical damage cap where after the normal damage cap every extra dps gets applied at a reduced rate (someone mentioned this long ago and I still think its a great idear / your idear (what about highsec tho)
---
Just do something ccpls
---
Correct. it will last until I have built my super and flown it.
---
That actually is what they should do and exactly how it should work. It's honestly that simple. They don't even have to write the bots they can license them from other game developers who have done the leg work. 
---

But the bridge Titan is the ship "locking on" to the remote cyno... not the subs.
---
yall are crazy, need to move NSH out from the middle there.  
---
*Rote* are the retards in that position.
---
What the fuck?
---
there are many possable ways to change the game, but actually hard to guarantee the fix will give an all positive outcome.
---
each balance will heavily effect the other parts to the game.
---
ive thought of many possable ways to change capitals.
---
removing NSA's (i mean, why do these exist)
---
splitting dreads into 2 types. each faction one HAW type and one AntiCapital type. (using up more of the mass minerals in the game)
---
REMOVE THE WARP CORE STABILITY ON SUPERS/TITANS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (this would effectively destroy and super and titans ability to just get dropped on roam fleets and such efficiently. so many would die.
---
increase build times for supers and titans.
---
remove the carriers ability to fit sirens (or maybe all support fighters) and move them back to no NSA, warp disruptor only ships.
---
make carriers fighters dps ability capital only (by making its signature hit size huge) but keep thier guns only on the fighters apply.
---
all these changes i dont think would effect the game in a drastic way in other parts or systems in place.
---
whacha'll think?
---
&gt; And that's where the comparison ends, as the Russians focus on PVP and the USTZ on Reddit posts. 
---
absolutely golden
---
We had 3 people online when you came, our home system literally had like 5 dudes which were mainly alts. You should have known there is was no escalation. However, I got ganked, shit happens. I try to take it on the chin cause that's how the game works.
---
I put the Vedmak loss completely on you guys though, you got away from the station camp, warped to safety, then warped to gate which you saw had a shitload of hate on it and died, surely that was avoidable.
---
Init and French connection both got wrecked. I'm assuming he's in initiative since FxR died in the first 5 minutes.

Came back to Eve after a six year break. Summary: It's all about timers, RMT, botting, skill injectors and other minor things that can all be summarised by 'pay to win'. Yes  Eve has devolved into every other shitful online game.
---
yup, pretty accurate
---
Can you imagine if that was your first experience in low-sec...
---
right click, move to asset safety
---
Beep boop, progod good
---
all of the above and.
---
remove NSA's (they serve no purpose whatsoever) or make it so they only assist in locking enemy fighters not actual ships someway.
---
REMOVE WARP CORE STABILITY ON SUPERS/TITANS!!!!!
---
All the big nullsec fights are bubblefucked to death anyway. when they get dropped on roaming fleets they couldnt just moonwalk away once they pwn half the fleet.
---
in lowsec, having a super and titan solo dropped on you and not being able to hold it long enough to ping for dreads in your t1 cruiser roam is frustrating.
---
would be nice to soak up minerals more, haw dreead and anti cap dread, split them into 2 different hulls for each faction? only pirate faction dreads can fit both? 
---
increase power grid requirements for haw guns would be a slight touch too.
---
SOMTHING, CHANGE ANYTHING 
---
:D

Its when someone says my Flanker fleet got Stukered, then they got chemoed while someone bosoned our fighters while some nerd sig tanked a doomsday in a mega while PGL rage pinged for a holy crusade.

If you start making lvl5s in 4b ships please let me know the system tnx.
---
Noooooo, it still isnt pay to win  but it is Pay to play, Just in difffrent way. You can still fit an oppressivly expensive ship and still lose it to a t1 frigate. Kek
---
1) get off of /r/eve

2) play the game

3) actually have fun

If you want to make it comfortable, I'd first have a look at joining the locals ;)

Back in the day we had small and mid size alliances whining about the super blobs of elitist organizations that resulted in farming and poaching of titan pilots. Today we have I guess former elitists whining about Rorquals because they level the playing field. But id agree Cap proliferation is indeed a problem, but I sure as hell don't wanna go back to the days of mining in 3 hulks and a boosting Rorq only for 5bil in ore every 6 months because the elitist boogeyman consistently visits the region to stunt the growth of my alliance and for Frags. (Me being spoiled and selfish I guess lol) as for what was proposed.
---
1.GTFO in tidi is Aids so I agree. 
---
2. Shoot sirens. 
---
3. What would make supers special without projectors, tis like taking away bridging for titans.
---
4. Don't ban HAWs from titans, decrease the damage by changing the classification of the weapons type from Capital class to something else idk. Then add new bonuses for tweakage while favoring Dreads. Boson spools can increase just slightly, not to much, just a tad. 
---
It's free real estate.
---
Let's be fair, a gerbil in a wheel is a better pilot in this instance.
---
I heard about the fight, a fleet advert went up and I joined as soon as I saw it was a cormorant ping i killed my Eve client and went to bed 
---

tell me, although i dont disagree with the picture and what it states.
---
if a structure is fit for caps. it does suck vs sub caps. if a structure is fit for anti sub cap (it still kind of sucks until fortizar or above, but it definatly sucks vs caps in that fit.
---
how does making it so only capitals are useful vs structures help anything in hisec atall?
---
*shaking intensified* stahp triggered me plox, i have many gudposts

I am sure you do, Everyone would want to, then no one has a fair playing experience without also having tools to input broadcast.
---
That's why it will get you banned if you do it.
---
The biggest issue I have with Rorqs is how ridiculously profitable they are. I'd like to temporarily move out of Null, try to set up shop and start my own corp to try to grow and eventually head back to Null and join a powerbloc, but I cant force myself to give up Rorq income.
---
Nah, I totally get that.  One of my first 'big' fights after graduating from Enlightened Academy to Enlightened Industries (Kick ENLI) was 6VDT and I remember it fondly, despite the actual reality of it being laggy and feeding hard.  I've taken part in some of the biggest events in the game, and indeed some of the smallest that had the ripple effect.  It's fundamentally a good game, and  it's one that you get better at quickly if you're willing to learn.
---
So just to prove my point, ill indulge you and bring it back to the basics.  
---
Lets say a new player, doesnt know shit from shit, joins your corp. The corp recruiter gives him a location, and gives him a basic skills plan and he begins his journey as a newbie in eve, bright eyed and bushy tailed.  
---
One of the first hurdles he will encounter will be the travel through dangerous nullsec all the way to your home, no?  
---
Okay so lets say this pilot thinks like the average intelligent human. He has a goal: Reach new home. He's been warned that his journey is dangerous.  
---
First set of actions, ask why. Finds out about gatecamps, bubbles, local chat, dscan, and booksmarks/pings.  
---
Makes his first en devour through nullsec, and he dies, despite his best efforts, to a sabre camping a gate. He respawns, talks in corp, gets some isk from corp mates and tries again, successful this time cause he's been taught how to gatecrash.   
---
Op success, hes made it to his new home and learned some game mechanics.  
---
So lets apply this to your titan friend.  
---
Jason has been playing since 2013, has a pretty good killboard at the fleet action level. Lets dive further.  
---
He has spent almost 90% of his eve kills as an F1 dps pilot at the fleet concept level, has a low percentage of solo kills (which i'm not judging, thats a playstyle thing) and clearly is involved in conflict in this game. Enough to know, or he fucking better know, basic grid mechanics and capital use. Hell, he's been involved in like a dozen capital kills in the last 30 days.
---
So *presumably* he knows:
---
* Warp mechanics including bubbles
---
* cynos and their implications
---
* basic fleet level tactics and concepts, focus fire/logistics/tackle/etc
---
Yes his most recent loss on zkill is a fucking cloaky hauler in jita to a tornado. Which means he warped to the station instead of an instant dock bookmark.  
---
And i believe it too. Because this guy ought to know about cynos, and the implications of an accidental jump for a bridge titan. He ought to know what to do in all of the plausible scenarios he can get himself into.  
---
here's your URL: [https://youtu.be/xKHIzhouKuM?t=52](https://youtu.be/xKHIzhouKuM?t=52)
---
marauders are the capital of hisec, they are worth thier cost
---
Small gang stuff is in the worst shape it's ever been, you used to get dropped by the odd cap but now it's just insane how many turn up at once.  Plus citaderps at every gate zzzzzz 
---
Evemon/Eve Seat
---
Only decent entity on that BR was French Connection !
---
removing insurance only hurts the little dude with no supers and titans. it hurts the dread bomb.
---
there are many fixes to capitals. removing insurance from dreads isnt one of them
---
Anything tjey would have dropped there would ruin the fight for the other side though.
---
And also think of how many unfair fights were stopped with the help of dropped capitals. Being ganked by a small gang is only fun for the gang unless you cyno to call your friends.
---
If you really want to get into the specifics they're like modern jet fighters, [like the F-35 as an example.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin_F-35_Lightning_II) Hint: the word fighter says it all. From looking at the different models I see both single seaters, up to two-main fighters. They're smaller than a frigate.
---
Eve has bad guys?
---
Imagine the market value of harvesters spiking as spod brains forget to recall before putting up boson delivery cyno. Sure the Rorq would have the enemy fleet brushed off... but hello 4b+ wake up call for not recalling.
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt know much about this guy but I‚Äôll say he‚Äôs consistent both in the wins / losses that the game needs work.. asserting this is a grand exit strategy by progodlegend to explain some odd shit narrative is just not accurate.
---
The only thing I‚Äôd ask is what if CCP just have zero fucks now .. nothing about their posture since acquisition outlines a hint that there is strong will for eve continuum .. I feel the cycle is probably running its course and unless their new owners infuse some stronger investment gains to improve the game beyond Asian markets I‚Äôd rate the chances of a productive rally point such as this as low.
---
But fuck it .. we have police skins now for a super so that will buy another 3 months community good will üôÉ
---
In truth you could pressure ccp into a feature gain via this route but they could also use this as a weapon to walk away with an excuse like ‚Äúwe have looked at the xyz ideas proposed but feel it‚Äôs too polarized to make a reactionary focused decision so we‚Äôll revert to our original roadmap and respectfully decline for now‚Äù
---
Now given there‚Äôs now actual tangible roadmap visible that addresses anything remotely your proposals / demonstrations all it ultimately provides is more cover fire for further delays community wise. Like you could mine this thread for ‚Äúwe are actively unpacking these ideas closely‚Äù sit tight for 3-6 months because ya know .. pos code made me do it.. and the. Reject them .. while at the same time not having to show any outward movement ..
---
You‚Äôre picking the style of fight but they get to pick the battlefield .. what could be a better use of the power is to force them back out to public view with a roadmap that answers the questions you promote .. less provide both question, debate and answer but ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs your plans here on xyz.. here look see it‚Äôs fucked because of blah blah‚Äù and hard stop..
---
No wiggle room and the lack of response builds compound interest in community sentiment.. ergo .. well soon see if my theory of zero fucks plays itself to be true .. which is then a signal to western markets ‚Äúit‚Äôs time to let the slow creep of end of life happen..‚Äù
---
Use a carrier - job done
---
&gt;user 
---
Your turn will be soon.
---
They tickle low power structures in high sec, but I've never seen them do more dps than the minimum damage to stop the structure from repairing lol
---
Utter bullshit!
---
I waited for a month to get a chance to pull out my carrier when only small ship fights were around all the time.
---
Udocking a carrier is a big risk of losing it, if a small gang of anything above those shity whiners catches you, there is no escape.
---
Daww. Happy planet is happy. 
---
They lack defence, blops are not defensive line ships. 
---
Lmao, I've gotten some pretty terrible feedback, but I do like making videos that more people than just my friends enjoy.
---
remove damage caps
---
Ok so we have one obscure YouTube video at best and a narrative to outline your expectations of a titan and in game feedback loop.. beyond that the information is shallow..
---
Like don‚Äôt get me wrong by the time you get a titan you should have leveled out on how to use ships in eve over maybe years of wreaking havoc across Eve in sub caps .. however the titan is definitely a bigger toy with more moving parts.. ideally you sit in test server practicing your play style with the said toy (assuming you find that sweet sync point with the server ship assets on test servers)..
---
However it‚Äôs still got some feedback loop from both senior peer players and more YouTube videos that are at times hit n miss on the info ... 
---
Point is and I stresss this .. expectations vs learning curve are two spectrums that continue to provide consistent ‚Äúhah he should have known‚Äù responses for future kill mails to come.. free kicks are easy to find post killmails but meh the part is always weak at the first statement which has the word ‚Äúshould‚Äù as it‚Äôs more of a ‚Äúcould‚Äù..
---
Just saying üôÉ
---
They are annoying to PGL, he couldn't extract his dreads because of them.Same with the GTFO, nobody really cares about it there are things more broken with caps , but since it was used on him multiple times , it must be nerfed.
---
I think its just part of the station plumbing. That individual big pipe is used to expel into space human waste collected on the ship. IDK
---
NC. titans etc had been seen by init and others before but for the chance of an actual fight they went anyway and it was nice to see NC./PL and even Tri stay and fight for a change, wish they would more often.
---
Capqu is a great man and Half-Empty is an honest homosexual corporation
---
to get everything together again:
---
\- before these structure are even in space: need control over the area by leading sov / or ask concord (or who ever is in charge inside system) to get permission ...of course based by standings! So no spamming in areas you don¬¥t have control over or (if npc) you don¬¥t have permissions!
---
\-&gt; reduce the spamming esp. in hostile space ... 
---
\- while anchoring it is not untouchable ...you need to defend it as long as it is anchoring (like the old player build stations! (egg)
---
\- no dmg cap (just hit points)
---
\- no fucking three timers
---
\- no defence in lowpower (just deleteable without fuel like old posses)
---
Thx for doing this like the day before yesterday!!!

You drop supers on frigates in Catch anyway though

Thought it was the community support team? 
---
Of course, I can only guess what he really wants but here what I think he is referring to server performance. The formula for turret hit probability is [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/images/e/eb/Turret\_hit\_chance.png](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/images/e/eb/Turret_hit_chance.png) It has roughly the same structure as his formula. Usually such a formula needs more FLOPs than a simpler formula. If 100 ships with 8 turrets each shoot on target in the same tick the server must calculate above formula 100 times and then roll 8 random numbers to calculate the damage. Changing above formula to a formula which is simpler for a computer to calculate would decrease server load. The tracking formula is only one example, calculation of ship movement and so on and so forth are other instances but I don‚Äôt have those formulas at my fingertips. So far what I think he meant.
---
But that isn‚Äôt the way to go. People have figured out how to handle such problems and the solution is parallelisation. According to informal statements by CCP employees, things happening on one node (and thus in one solar system) are not parallelised. In above example this means that the server circles through the 100 ships in a for loop and through the 8 turrets in an inner loop. (Note that this is a simplification as I don‚Äôt know how they exactly programmed stuff but for the point which will follow that isn‚Äôt important.) Nowadays (actually for a while now) you would try to avoid this. Ideally you would write all the variables of the ships in a matrix and put those matrices into the formula. Formally, you must calculate the same things and have the same number of FLOPs. But, many libraries (like NumPy for python) can parallelise this automatically and are generally very efficient at doing those kinds of operations. In fact, processor design moved into a direction to support this even better. 
---
I never talked to any CCP devs but they surely know about things like that and would love to move more into that direction. But obviously there are problems. Let‚Äôs take above example. If 100 ships hit one guy at once but 50 would be enough to volley him currently the ‚Äúfirst‚Äù 50 in the loop do damage to him and the other 50 don‚Äôt (but are on the killmail). If you would do the change I suggested above there wouldn‚Äôt be a ‚Äúfirst‚Äù anymore. You would have to solve that for the killmail damage. That would actually be simple to solve but there might be many underlying dependencies which are much more severe than who is on what killmail. The modern approach is to modularise you code to decrease dependencies. CCP seems to be working on that.

I don't see any FAX on the losing side?  Pretty easy to dreadbomb without a wall of FAX blocking you, just FYI.

Thanks now im gonna spend my whole day re-watching all the Clear Skies instead of being productive. 
---
&gt;Interestingly, Snuff titans had been starting to move around in Rakapas. I think they decided not to get in on things when they saw the NC. supers and titans.
---
Why would we need to do that when we have RR Wyvern caches in every region?
---
nah, missing the story background, i miss most of the politics post.
---
jsut to be clear, it took me a month to understand that TEST is an alliance ticker, and not a flair!

I now have the mental image of docking up in my Machariel, a hatch on the bottom side opening up and just raining tons and tons of human shite down the hole. Every time we dock.

I literally did this last week.  Forgot how brilliant they were.
---
That's a well balanced review  of the area.... Minmil form up is worse than watching paint dry - we can normally form 5 or so pretty quick, but after that... I've seen climate change move faster.
---
So other than jumping out, and the min fleet size to alpha EHP values, there is very little difference ya?
---
Ignoring the obvious support ships that would allow BS to engage frigates (Recons, T3C, etc) or specific tactics like MJDs, your response is that you basically 'upship from frigates'.
---
This is my entire point.  'Capitals' are bad.  You e-bushido prevents you from using your own capitals because of some nihilistic fantasy that Sub-caps are more fun, or are somehow more deserving of being flown than another ship type?
---
What elite super fun ship are you terrorizing the eve galaxy with?  100mn Munin?, T2 Ferox?  The captial dps level, nano armor trig shit?
---
Nobody's taken me up on this idea yet and you're a thoughtful poster, so how's this: give HICs a new script that gives them a 40 or 50 km range cyno masking field that prevents any caps from jumping to the target cyno.  It doesn't have to prevent new cynos going up, just jam out anything in the radius - or be a single-target deal so it can't prevent new arrivals and reinforcements to a huge titan slugfest.
---
I'm sure you'll be an asset. Best of luck!
---
It's more a minigame for HACs now but your point stands.
---
Look at that lovely, non monochrome ui
---
you're salty that people didn't want to welp subcaps into you dude, that just sad
---
I like you guys, even been for irl beers with a few but the WZ action is really elsewhere.

I have a friend who rents basically just so he can krab enough to fund his solo pvp habits elsewhere without feeling the need to deal with stratops or monthly requirements. Renters are a mixed bunch.

Tristan runs an alliance called Amarrian State now. They're not all that active, but they're there.

The "get friends" part is a pretty good one. Reach out to other alliance and/or big corps that have similarities OR can offer something you (currently) can't and work with them.   
---
Basically: Start diplomacy as early as possible - even in highsec ;)

Erm, you realize that the damage cap is there for exactly that reason. So you can't just jump in 100 dreads and erase the citadel in no time.   
---
It's there so you commit to the field for a certain time and have to stay there - giving the defender a chance to fight you.  
---
Imagine if you made todays players warp to gates at 15...
---
What kind of kill we talking about? 
---
because ccp wont do shit with injectors, cat's out of the bag for that one. nerfing ships is still *something* they can do
---
Dont forget the Coercers big brother, the Confessor.
---
HOW MUCH?
---
Well, the problem is, that allways the "best" offer counts. If you have a list, where no one is charged and the members are the same as in your other lists, where you charge them ISK, then no one pays.
---
Thats not always a sign of an issue with evemon.
---
ESI has a huge failure rate and can fail/error for no reason one second and be fine the next. It's super finicky. Have the same issue when adding characters to auth, ones fine, next fails, try again it works
---
Because no one would bother to start playing if only the guys who had access to end-game stuff started years ago? Basic logic yo..

"All the winning we've been getting"
---
Your math is off.   
---
Yearly SP trained is still 22m. So most ships with focused training are a year or less, excluding titans which are 30m sp.   
---
Also it is worth noting that most hard T2 skills are lowered nowadays. You dont need S M L t2 guns to train cap guns to t2 anymore. Same goes to caps, which needed many racial lvl5‚Äôs before. 
---
You can have a perfect yeild rorqual char for 17m SP. 
---
So 9.4 month assuming youre not running accelerators.

tbh, i saw french connection gunner wrecking goon sub fleets with their fort. they're not useless against subs.

Remember engine trails?

Not even credit card, I got into all my stuff by in game mechanics.  2 injectors a month was my goal and I hit it frequently enough to where I made it 4 a month.  I wouldn't use RL cash for it,  but I'll gladly pay my sub and work towards it
---
Am I really wrong though? I understand its good for the 'game', but CCP is a business, regardless. Nerds are always going to get triggered that their beloved game can get dirtied by the guys at the top only focused on more financial gain, but we as a society encourage it so I'm not sure why it is so hard to understand.  
---
No, it's busy and distracting.
---
hahaha, then blap through all the Clarion Calls...thats a full days work right there.
---
Should be fine outside of peak times, be wary of tasty looking bait in plexes.  Solo frigs can branch out a bit further and still find fights where gangs can't really.

That's awesome man!

Hey there! I'm no expert in fixing Sec Status.
---
But if you're looking at making a return to the game, are you interested at all in coming out to Null Sec?
---
\[UCATR\] as part of the Tactical Supremacy Alliance are looking for PVP enthusiasts! Hit me up if you want to chat more.
---
Yes, injectors (and extractors) have fundamentally changed the character of the game.  There's no going back.  I liked the way I was able to extract value from all the characters I'd trained over the years.  
---
On the other hand something important has been lost, as of course it always is when the vacuous corporate bean-counters get involved.
---
Or how well you pick up on things.  I've put 2 years in and managed to find how to make plenty for my injectors.  
---
It just seems to me most vets have jump freighters. Allow the noobs to have a chance hauling shit to their guys by letting us use these ships.
---
Get shot at.
---
I feel a lot of you have been so elite for so long you do not understand the plight of the noobie.
---
Injectors exarcerbate the problem because people can switch to FOTMs faster and scale up operations, but they dont cause them.
---
in that case, goon made the fort useful somehow like step into pds rage not that because fort are effective against sub.
---
It's because most of reddit posts are retarded circlejerking mumble.
---
Oh. Hmmm. Well, ESI results are often cached, at least, and there seems to be an ESI bug on corp transactions (I get the same thing, but _also_ with other apps).
---
Are there any consequences if the wingy bits get holes in them?
---
No. The way how skills in eve work, the game absolutely needs a catchup mechanic for new players. I started playing eve in late 2016 and without skill injectors I would have quit after a few weeks for sure. If you join late eve is already overwhelming as fuck, having to just wait for months and months to fly certain ships, let alone capitals or supers is extremely discouraging. Having skill injectors in mind I always had and still have a goal that was reachable through determination and using game mechanics (aka power krabbing). Without it eve is just a waiting simulator.
---
Needs more sofa...great sketch mate.  
---
(and rip machinima style gaming vids...Clear Skies is from the days when the idea of watching someone else play a game was considered a bit insane, when a certain amount of creativity was the entry level to getting views) 
---
Why dafaq a Capital should suck vs a subcap ?
---
The concept is so stupid I stop reading as soon I saw the idea...
---
End the evening with some old Curzon Dax parodies, and you've got a pretty good day.
---
Sure üòÅ
---
problem with this it will make dreads even less useful.  
---
dreads rely on the ehp to live long enough to do damage against super's and other caps.   
---
they can nuke carriers and fax's pretty fast but when it comes to a super if there are even a small amount off fax's on grind they supers just tank them or tank so long your losing lost off dreads  for maybe killing a couple super's.  
---
form what ive experienced  70 dreads vs 10-15 dreads and titans  maybe 10 carriers an 6-8 fax's  = all dreads and dead and maybe 4-5 dead fax's.  
---
Dreads even need a new role or  just remove there siege and give me half there current siege damage. in the hull  
---
Siege could just give them a reduction in structure damage cap allowing them to do more damage (past damage cap) then any thing else while siege. making siege actually  mean siege.  
---
Maybe even give them a slight buff against structure defenses while siege meaning they take less damage fore stuff like keeps but they can be rep'd  
---
You're genuinely the good guys, we tried to join up but only lasted a few days.  Militia life is difficult and full of compromise, trying to be inclusive as possible is a nice approach, but not one that really doesn't work for us us; prefer to just shoot everyone.  
---
Solomon gets pissed.
---
I assume also decent tank and support skills and stuff like combat drones.       
---
I feel like it worth pointing out pretty much all of wormhole space players will absolutely kick in your sandcastle more so then a few war targets the nature of eve is a pvp sandbox if you choose to undock you have to accept the potential ship death and if you can‚Äôt replace it don‚Äôt fly it 
---
Great AAR. I sat there and watched in an ares since alliance wanted nothing to do with NC super and titan fleet. No dunks to be had, what a utter shame. Opportunity missed. GF everyone and awesome afternoon light show
---
Why would you need any of that though.
---
5/5
---
So... Any chance you could fill us in on how the auth data is intended to be entered?
---
People injecting into mechanically intensive sub-caps is not a problem, people injecting into ships that are better than 90% of the other available ships in the game whilst requiring the mechanical ability of a monkey is the problem..
---
It was actually an onyx that died before it could even cyno then it was a proteus that lived long enough for 10+ devoters to come in. You were close tho
---
evemon
---
And you think it was different when we started 10 years ago? I also used to look at people with supers of even regular caps with envy in the beginning. But i worked myself up and finaly got all the way up to titan after 7 years. Thats how it was when owning them meaned something and was an achievement. Not the dull "everyone has one so it's nothing special" prolifiration of today
---
&gt;Goons will suppress any attempts of other alliances to do the same. Why do you think panfam are not following goons? They tried but it didnt work as they got shit on my goon sigs 23/7.
---
They spread out their umbrella across deklein for quite a while, and one random ass "coalition" does not make a proper umbrella. The current goonswarm alliance is like 9 alliances IIRC, in one alliance ticker, in one staging keepstar, in one region. 
---
&gt; Mining is boring for most players = trying to encourage most alliances to become the next krabbing haven is super hard. 
---
What isk-making is fun? 
---
You also ignore that mining is just 1 part of the delve system. I haven't mined in 6 months. My rorqual alts are fax alts now. 
---
Delve is one massive machine that takes in ore and goo, and spits out ships, modules, ammo, supercapitals, citadels, JFs and everything else. There's a dozen easy jobs to make money from, and if you just rat or whatever for your isk, then you have cheap ships and modules and supercapitals and capitals to buy. Your isk not only comes in quick, it buys a lot more. 
---
&gt; Most of the krabs who will rorq mine are in goons 
---
I'm sure the other alliances have plenty of people who want to just undock at any time of the day and watch a movie while making 120M isk an hour per rorqual. If they contract it to a reprocesser service they get 89% of the mineral yield, and from that they can make ships and t1 stuff, then they can put 11 reaction slots to use on each rorqual alt and turn moongoo into the stuff you need to make t2 components, then you can convert the t1 stuff you made into t2 stuff, and on every step of the way you multiply the money you made with your rorquals. You could even fit these things together into fitted ships and add another few percentage points in profit. You can even use your spy alts to import this shit to enemy staging keepstars and then you get paid an extra profit margin every time your enemy dies. Now THAT is a funny way to make isk. 
---
&gt; Goons have superior capital forces/numbers = others cant defend their rorqs 
---
If every little eastern and northern group combined into one supergroup, they'd have more people than goons. If I recall correctly they'd actually have more than the entire Tapirium (test+goons). Not only in people but titans (if they'd just stop suiciding their shield titans in every fight they'd get omni damage DD volleys too). 
---
Can be. Tbh i trained all on the old path.         
---
Simply my assumption is that you don't start to train everything from the focus side and **don't have isk to train all items at the same time**        
---
Those delays assume that you need to make isk to run alt accounts and keep them training at peek efficiency without 'undocking them'.          
---
Of course if you start training all accounts at the same time you will be done in 1-1.5 year.           
---
I simply assume plexed alts. 
---
When did I complain in the above post?
---
I welcomed Phoebe, btw.
---
I totally agree on this, but tell me why people will not inject in next most oppressive thing after this?           
---
Like you know - how oppressive can be battle rorquals... 30 of them dropped on a 5 man gang ... or anything else.           
---
Main problem is that people can move from one thing to another.      
---
**So maybe instead of nerfing one thing after another we could decide what is the goal**          
---
* If the goal is to let roamers have some fun without constant drops we could also add a spollup timer on cyno - like 20s - it is enough for 95% nano ships to move out out of scram/web range from target that is under cyno effect and simply cannot move.             
---
* If the goal is to make dreads viable again against titan bloob ... again solution is to limit the emergency damage control usage on faxes and give bonus to dreads using those.            
---
Like fighters are not OP during the battles - and all recent fights proved this that they lack mobility on the battlefield.           
---
**What is the goal?**                       
---
Yup. I've looked through the chatlogs, and I've also been present in Jita throughout all of this.  
---
The only time the guy hasn't been spam-scamming using the macro is a few hours after server DT. Apart from that, it's been all day long for several weeks.
---
The day that EVE crossed into pay-to-cheat territory with injectors was the day the game started to die for me.
---
I mean a little shove down a set of stairs for a faction cruiser seems perfectly reasonable.
---
Not classic. But pre fozzie so, pre rorq, pre injector eve üòç
---
When you self destruct whoever shot last gets the killmail. 
---
Bit wrong here.         
---
This is a game.       
---
Many people could quit before reaching capital level as many people quit eve after a year of playing - simply getting bored.        
---
Also ability to do he most profitable/most effective thing  de valuates everything less effective even more.             
---
Changes are instant instead of 1-2 year spool up timer before any issues are becoming visible.           
---
Simplifying example. If you need 2 years before rorqual reduce super/titan price to ridiculous levels - you need like 1.5year before player catch up with skills for the supers/titans.           
---
If supers/titans are issue and you need more faxes - it will take another year to train them - so we are talking about easy 3 years before we get to like 30% of situation we have now in terms of force proliferation 
---
Can Nestor's themselves instarefit?
---
Why can't you just be happy flying fed navy comet in FW for 2 years, while being farmed by veteran players every time you try to do something else. Oh and haven't you heard? Most skills are fine at level 4, you just need to believe in that.
---
On a serious note, I feel you. I have started in the early 2013 (actually in the late 2010, but I dropped out quickly due to having to train 1-2 month of learning skills first). 2013 was the time when CCP created few million skillpoints out of thin air by splitting Battlecruisers and Destroyers skills into racials. I had no time to catch up before the patch, so I had to train all destroyers V the hard way, and I've only fixed my battlecruiser skills with injectors.
---
Everyone has their own goals. I'm far more interested in what CCP's goal is with all this. 2+ years now and we haven't heard shit from them besides "we're looking into it". 
---
Use the add ons. Though I'm not sure what to do after. Do we paste the result into the first 15 rows?
---
I don't deny it.       
---
Like i posted **injectors are here and cannot be changed to not let new people be even more behind** also CCP want your money.   
---
We don't need nerfs - but changes to how New Eden works.        
---
Ok posting this again :          
---
&gt;I don't deny it.                    
---
Like i posted injectors are here and cannot be changed to not let new people be even more behind also CCP want your money.            
---
We don't need nerfs - but changes to how New Eden works             
---
At least one Tempest
---
Skill injectors was one of the worst additions to the game (though probably a financial success on their business side). I like the idea of training multiple pilots at once (and think that should be enabled on all Omega accounts rather than purchased) but injecting SP is lame. 
---
That said, I'm guilty of it, but I wish it hadn't been made an option. When I trained into a proper RRBS doctrine fit back in the day, I had a real feeling of accomplishment. Now, I inject the skills to get a bowhead running in a few minutes and I'm just like, whatever.
---
Not Brave's though, that's just some weird TEST dude doing his own thing
---
Fall off the ship!
---
They have a name you know
---
I think the word "feed" and is what is killing this game. Every FC and their mother afraid to "feed" the other side. 
---
You can use a really cheap carrier to do em, even something like the Chimera works.
---
https://imgur.com/a/tF0H8lN
---
Follow that. Made it for one of my previous sheets. Method still the same. Though if you copied the Sheet you wont have to re-add the add-ons.
---
Repeat the last two pics for every toon you want to Auth.
---
If the new solution to any small gang will be rapid heavy missile Typhoons - people will have just 15 alts sitting on each gate.           
---
Maybe comeback to drones and assist?      
---
50 drones (sentry or light) assigned to a fast locking ship on each gate also can be issue for any roaming gang - **REMEMBER PEOPLE HAVE ALT ACCOUNTS AND DON'T HAVE TO PAY FOR THEM THANKS TO EXTRACTORS**       
---
Big letters but real issue - people can easily adapt now and add accounts without any additional costs. 
---
Querns is like the posting version of DBRB.
---
Yo guys, hoping you can help answer this question: What is the latest version of EVE? If I download it, will I still be able to log into the same character I have at the moment? Thanks 
---
Tbh current goal is to meet the income levels agreed with Pearl Abyss.     
---
This goal we can be sure as it is a 'contractual one' 
---
Once you auth you can click the Auth again (to add more characters). Once a toon is Authed the Auth Data is automatically filled in.
---
Once you added all the toons go to 'Loading Helper' Page and start telling the pages to load all the Calculations. I left them all at Don't Load by default so it didn't try to shit itself on others computers.
---
Yeah cheap carrier is the way to go
---
What is the lifesaver icon?
---
Not entirely true. Only macros which in any way give a gameplay advantage. For example the macros described above are not allowed. However a macro to log in all your characters at once is okay. 
---
Mass.
---
Problem with your theory is its SHIT how do you intend on killing highsec forts and keeps then if you make sub caps do nothing... Oh what wait you dont know how eve mechanics work do you.... Get rekt
---
I feel the only way to balance out what injectors have done is to introduce a new bonus/requirement mechanic that is measured in time/usage only. Something that accounts for the time you spend undocked and untethered in a ship that adds a bonus to use of that ship (The more time you spend flying a VNI the better you are at flying one). These should be tangible bonuses like increased speed, decreased align time, etc. but not big, just a percent or two per 1000 hours or so. Same with module use. The more you scram and web, the better you should be at it in game. Tracking speed should increase the more you use a particular type of turret.
---
This is the only thing left to make time in game mean something for a character. A 1v1 PVP between two of the same ship shouldn't be an RNG toss-up if one player has been flying that ship for 3 years and the other just created that character.
---
People like you are what dilutes EvE. Need a catchup mechanic? Go play some other game, thanks in advance. 
---
There is no need to "catch up" and most of us never asked for that. When I started people were waay ahead of me but saying you can¬¥t do shit is simply wrong. There was a nasty time where you had fucking clone grades and this time was horrific for new and old players but when that shit got removed it was fine. And no, I am not one of these super old vets who had a titan/super before everyone else. In fact I don¬¥t have a titan/super to this day because there was a never a need for it. I am able to fly supers yes but that is because my "specialised char" had nothing to train anymore after a few years. 
---
The wingy bits are squaaaare.
---
Why dreadbomb when you can also Titanbomb?
---
This ship and this Machinima are the reason I want to train and fly Minmatar... --"
---
Stop you‚Äôre gonna trigger elo
---
No, you are absolutely right in that CCP can do whatever they want.
---
Although, I don't agree with the first point of the original comment, a lot of people bothered to start playing before the introduction of injectors, and trained for years into ships.
---
you weren't there main... the terror, the terror
---
Not 100% sure, but I think it was support/petition
---
Things are a lot different today than they were 10 years ago though. Doctrines weren't so strict. Small gang kitchen sink stuff was *way* more prevalent than it is today, so you had a place in a roaming gang no matter what you could fly. FCs knew not everyone could fly everything and they planned around it. They always made sure everyone could contribute *somehow*, because having more bodies on the field was always better than telling them to sit at home and keep training.
---
Injectors changed all that. What used to be a years long journey through all kinds of content is now compressed into whatever is FOTM that you need to inject into if you want to participate in anything. "Skipping the grind" also means skipping tons of content that will probably never be relevant again, thanks to injectors. Like who the fuck is going to mine in a Retriever if they can inject into a Rorq? Who's going to bother learning how to fly cruisers properly if they can inject into a carrier or a super and shit on them? Sad.
---
Please no.       
---
People have RL... my kid is 9yo and i play eve longer.     
---
Why do you want me to leave char cloaked in some spot ... so i have chance to compete with a 12yo that have nothing else to do?
---
Making all those gate bookmarks again ... damn you :D
---
Remember drag bubbles in the middle of systems ? 
---
Im in 2 minds about injectors and I always will be.
---
On the one hand you are right, it is oppressive and a huge issue.
---
On the other, I hard quit a few years ago liquidating everything to a holding toon. Injectors allowed me to come back
---
Stillwaiting for CCP to backdown on thier tyrranic stance towards emulation so we can have emulation for 10yr old eve versions, private server for when CCP goes down the drain and all  
---
renember when your ship looked like it took damage by spewing fire and crap everywhere? 
---
Damn so sick of the complaining about capitals here. Alliance up, get into a dread or carrier, go have a cap fight, and have fun
---
Only when they are made out of wingy bits from a maelstrom.
---
I can understand that point of view, but there is also another point.
---
Imagine having started in 2007, having spent lots of time to train your chars, and to diversify your setup (Subs, Dread,FAX,Super/Titan + Holders), having created a reputation for not being bad and then seeing people starting your time having the same full setup after 1 year. That totally invalidates all my efforts and feels like a kick to the balls. And like me many old players think, and we were/are the ones that feed the PLEX market with our RL money. The consequences you can see in the plex market, old guys stop buying PLEX with cash and all the young guns want to feed PLEX to their PvE-Multiboxes ... PLEX price skyrocketing considering the fact that CCP even artificially inflated the PLEX market with heavily discounted packages.
---
Because when i started to play eve there was a rule that before you undock a ship you have all support skills on at least lvl 4.             
---
Something about 'not feeding' have also thing to do with this. 
---
Marauders are expensive for a reason... Jesus this subreddit hurts me physically
---
So structures should be shit against theyr biggest threat and subs should be good against caps there for caps are basically useless since you only use them to bash structures and defenders can kill your caps with subs which have way less risk :\ 
---
Might be a rule in some alliance but not the game itself. Just be in a cozy ultra safe krabbing pocket and mine your heart out.
---
Those accounts are paid for though.
---
come back everyone needs a logi bro
---
The catchup mechanic _is in the game right now_ so you might as well play EVE itself.
---
What have this to do with anything?       
---
Are the capitals, supers or titans ... maybe rorquals not omega now?     
---
The problem atm is that not enough people use their credit card to buy PLEX/ISK and too much people use Rorqual yields to sub accounts. 
---
Hmmm ... do you group weapons?  Pressing F1 and having all your turrets firing simultaneously is botting.
---
CCP ENDORSES botting.
---
Fantastic work!  I couldn't help but notice how nice your handwriting is...I can barely read my own lol
---
&gt;Yes and some people might not want to build an empire as they way to have fun in the game. 
---
And is it fun to be nomadic VNI-ratters and barge-miners while the NGSA hunts you from region to region? How long does it take to earn 500 plex with a VNI? 
---
&gt;Some people just want their alliance to be a solid PvP group. 
---
You mean they want a green killboard? Who the fuck cares these days? 
---
To be a solid PVP group you kinda have to be able to afford losing ships. Imagine an army that can't afford to lose a single soldier. That army can't exactly accomplish much. And if you assume for sake of argument that you have 10% taxes and zero alliance fuel costs and such, then for every Munnin you personally lose, your alliance members have to rat 10 Munnins worth of isk, for the SRP wallet to afford to replace your 1 Munnin. 
---
Think about that the next time you blueball a fight, is it because you wouldn't win, or because losing a few Munnins at the start before you kill some of the enemy fleet, would bankrupt your "solid PVP" alliance? 
---
&gt; Now it's not about the group with less supers should have the ability to fight the group with less, it's about how supers shouldn't be the perfect counter to every situation. 
---
It doesn't matter how bad supers are at killing subcaps, everyone will still drop them simply because you can't kill them quickly and they don't have to gate (Chasing after a fleet is cancer). 
---
I like the idea of spooling cyno. Doesn't make sense that an inhibitor has to spool but the cyno is instant..
---
I think you misunderstood me then sorry, as my comment was in regards to the fact that a new guy would not feel comfortable starting the game now if they had zero chance in catching up on the guys who started years ago.  
---
I come from times when there was no safe krabbing pockets, and when we showed up in a region every one docked up 20jumps in each direction.             
---
This was times when there was no response or defensive fleets and you knew what group is PVP one as it lived in NPC space farming everything around.           
---
Different times, different EVE - this will never come back. 
---
You're blaming evemon for an ESI problem.
---
You could buy characters on the bazaar long before injectors
---
Reduce bastion time to 40 seconds. 
---
Yeah, nerfing ships is honestly stupid. A lazy nerf, that is. I kind of agree with nerfing a certain aspect of a ship to make it less effective for certain roles.
---
To be more specific, I wish the nerfs CCP might be pushed to make won't affect every single fucking corner of eve. 
---
The community's largest, noisiest voice is that of nullseccers, and that's also where the bulk of the community is. I wish for people like small gangs and small time wormhole corps like mine that use caps, that the nerfs don't affect us as much. Whenever we try to find a fight we always find ourselves outnumbered, and the tools that allow us to fight with few against many are limited. 
---
The nerf they did on FAXes kind of fucked us small timers over as well, and I didn't really like that. I am hoping they take more things into account and not do a lazy ass nerf.   
---
Another example is nerfing fucking 500mn hictors and that left us wormholers with our pants down for while, after which they introduced a fucking module to fix it, a thing that we didn't need before, to accomplish the same goal.  
---
I'll give you a hint, you need 3 carriers that align and warp as fast as possible
---
But your picture clearly shows the contracts are not put up 24/7 at all.
---
Paladin has the extra extra utility high slot to deal with too much neut pressure. Put a cyno in it. 
---
Can we get an extra middlot on the paladin while we're asking for presents. 
---
&gt; And is it fun to be nomadic VNI-ratters and barge-miners while the NGSA hunts you from region to region? How long does it take to earn 500 plex with a VNI?
---
This has about 0 meaning in regard to what you are quoting
---
&gt; You mean they want a green killboard? Who the fuck cares these days?
---
"Solid PvP group" doesn't mean KB padding, it's just about being able to fight other alliances.
---
&gt; o be a solid PVP group you kinda have to be able to afford losing ships. Imagine an army that can't afford to lose a single soldier. That army can't exactly accomplish much. And if you assume for sake of argument that you have 10% taxes and zero alliance fuel costs and such, then for every Munnin you personally lose, your alliance members have to rat 10 Munnins worth of isk, for the SRP wallet to afford to replace your 1 Munnin.
---
Yeah or you're members are grown enough players and they can farm their ships themselves. And many alliances without a shit ton of industrialist like Goons are able to provide SRP with renters or just taxes, or just limited SRP which is good enough for many people.
---
&gt; It doesn't matter how bad supers are at killing subcaps, everyone will still drop them simply because you can't kill them quickly and they don't have to gate (Chasing after a fleet is cancer).
---
If they are dropped anyway but they don't have stupid application, does it really matter ?
---
Newb here, was that entirely legal or bannable offense?
---
Yes, the latest version is always the only version that can be used, and will always be able to access your characters.
---
It was legal
---
The bazaar on the official forums is legal and monitored by CCP, no scamming allowed. Buy a character outside of that (like on eBay) is not allowed.
---
But the limited supply on the bazaar would never have allowed big portions of the player base to spec into some new fad on a whim. Every character being sold on there still had to be trained into things over many months or years. 
---
These two players were in the same fleet regularily. Looks like some killboard cosmetics...
---
That wasn't as bad because it didn't allow accelerated mass production of characters with specific skillsets.
---
If the Moros got buffed tomorrow and was too good, you couldn't just have 600 people train into them tomorrow.
---
By all means warp your sub caps on my gangs grid or try to keep up with us.
---
I just looked through every single picture chribba has up on eve files archive. Some cool shit in there like the frick shark in can art. My oldest is from 20.01.2005 when huzzah was camping r3.
---
You can fit a fancy Astero for PvP, that's obvious, it's more the exploration fit that I'm having trouble figuring out. There are very few fancy modules you could add to make exploration more efficient.
---
Oooooh, right! Cheers.
---
&gt; D-N-G will form when TheLastSparton needs some numbers I guess.
---
I chortled.
---
i think you still underestimate aset :D this are the monthly top systems this month from the amarr perspective  [http://prntscr.com/me87kh](http://prntscr.com/me87kh) 
---
Wow, you're retarded. 
---
Those are just the finished contracts...
---
This is not true for one simple reason, the Character Bazaar. Even if the character needed to be trained by hand before injectors, you could then already buy characters through the bazaar. The methodology changed, the issue didn't. 
---
what about rorquals though. Isn't it ridiculous that you can semi AFK farm 150 mil per hour worth of ore, allowing you to have multiple characters (upto 50) doing same without issue, supers and caps will become throwaway stuff and will, well, get thrown more often at you.
---
That's basically what you do.  
---
Except in this instance the guy uses a macro to automate control + up 24/7.
---
Yup, back to Black Rise it'll be!
---
Carriers, supers and titans apply just as well to subcaps as HAW dreads do, much better even. When people drop caps on some subscaps they drop carriers and supers. Not dreads. 
---
K, that's great and all, but what about wormhole space. Are structures in lower level wormholes just never supposed to be shot at? This would necessitate some kind of module for t3cs or something that would allow them to destroy structures in c1s without needed to ship stuff in to build dreads.
---
The problem is the price of the injectors. It's broken if you can make money from injector farms. What should be happening is that you can extract less value in skillpoints from a character than it costs to keep that character active. Currently, with accelerators and what-not, you can extract almost 3 times as much.
---
Your point? It's not like people just stop falling for scams for convenient 10 hour gaps at a time.
---
I've been playing the game for years and I still don't get it, and that worries me.
---
Call the Vogons
---
"There's no clouds ahead, just clear skies."
---
they should kinda design a ''mini-carrier'' a smaller, less tanky  version that holds fighters battleship sized, but with the same fighter mechanics.
---
Stainguy may be a pain in the ass but he is correct with his analysis. The usual counter argument to injectors is "but we had a character bazar", well the people using this argument forget that you had to train characters before you can sell them time was a main factor. 
---
Not to forget the risk you took training up specific chars and them being obsolete after meta or game changes, example Tengu chars a lot people lost a lot of ISK.
---
Anyway the major problem isn't injectors alone, it is the vicious cycle of injectors &gt; Rorquals and the scalability of Rorquals. That lead to the Super/Titan shitfest we have now. In other words EVE economics is totally out of whack to much Ore and ISK are floating around.
---
The only solution i can see is upkeep for every Capital ship and any Structure. Something like 0,2% upkeep of the building material costs per month.
---
Titan ~ 1b upkeep per month 
---
Keepstar ~ 5b upkeep per month 
---
It is scalable in any direction.
---
Look at The Bleak Lands for the last week, doesn't really compare - I'm also talking about the type of fights you'll find and it's not so interesting outside core Bleak Lands, even then it's mainly 4 systems
---
Rapid heavy missile typhoons are already in use as a home D doctrine, see provi.
---
You use a Keres/damps to kill their lock range, then wittle them down and warp out and back in if need be. They don't appear out of thin air like capitals, you see them coming and can setup appropriately. It also helps that they're only \~100k EHP at best (considerably less if they're nano+rep)
---
50 normal drones (Ishtars,VNI,Vexor etc) **DON'T HAVE SIRENS AND DROMI'S, JUST WARP OFF**
---
That is also only 10 VNI's or Ishtars or Vexors/Domi, which is fightable if you have decent range, and all of them are slow, which means you can just warp around grid, pop the little ships first and slowly wittle the drone blob down by killing the less tankier ships.
---
What you mention is stuff small gangs already deal with regularly and have counters to because they're subcaps and actually have multiple counters. Its not like VNI's go 14k/s, pack their own webbing/pointing drones and have 3m+ EHP.
---
You don't seem to understand, that people shipping their 15 alts in subcaps is nowhere near as big a problem as those alts being capitals. Not even just for small gang, but for the economy (Rorqs/Ratting supers). Also, flying a carrier gives a large amount of leeway at being a shitty pilot, cause they're damn near idiot proof due to how good they apply. Even the max spod brained can fend off a small gang (that isn't specifically setup to deal with capitals, as in, 100mn or logi gang)  with a shitty carrier if they're awake. A spodbrain in a RHML typhoon that needs to rep and move around requires a lot more effort and can be easily taken down if they are just relying on their "alts" to win.
---
I bridge with a boson fit... Just in case I "accidentally" jump instead of bridging onto a fleet that just happens to be engaged and within 30km...
---
But they buy plex from the people that used their credit card so...
---
This is not true for one simple reason, the supply on the character bazaar was always limited by the time it took to train them. There's *no way* the bazaar could have supported the number of people currently injecting themselves into things. 
---
New patch comes out and makes Marauders awesome, everyone starts a Marauder doctrine, 2 hours later every character that can fly Marauders is bought up and the supply is exhausted. It doesn't even come close to the flexibility that injectors allow.
---
Injectors don't cause butthurt, Capitals do. 
---
Our lord and saviour PGL, show us the way.
---
I fly an interesting "micro-carrier" Algos with max drone distance and damage. It is fun as hell!  Get a fleet of those and shred most anything while way out of range.
---
&gt; Whenever we try to find a fight we always find ourselves outnumbered
---
why not just split in two and fight each other? i mean if you are having inconsequential fights anyhow why not make them easy to find?
---
TBH I think the problem is in the super/titan proliferation. The solution would be to turn all the BPO's out there in 10 Run BPC's and make supers/titans 1 run bpc's only available by grinding very hard missions for the empires.
---
Makes sense in a back ground game history for the empires to take back the BPO's from capsuleers since these ships are a "threat" to their power.   
---
Well i like your ideas but regarding injectors you need to go back to the drawing Board
---
It takes 25 injectors to inject a Basic rorq mining toon and 50 for a Basic Titan toon a super toon is slightly below 50 depending on what you want out  of it.
---
Also the proliferation is a Real issue in this game as let alone test mined 112 Titans in december assuming the worst presets for building one
---
The better you get with those presets the more Titans will come out so in 2 months of consecutive mining and 3 Months time for building we could put out an entire Titan fleet and that cant be good.
---
And yes im saying this despite being in test and being an industrialist myself. 
---
Why not both?
---
**What allows you to have those ~50 rorquals ?**        
---
Fact that you can inject one after another or fact that you had self determination to spend 5 years slowly training them all while you could afford next one? (faster and faster).          
---
**Are rorquals bad?**      
---
Sure they do - but they are here and people inject into them constantly - CCP will keep them as long as they can (tbh normal business)   
---
Solution?       
---
Remove excavators (make them working like oversized mining barges) or introduce T1 version for them ... but at the same time remove panic (or should i say remove panic and compensate by reduced ship value) and limit the fitting by much lower CPU.      
---
 
---
People will still inject into those **(CCP happy)** they will be cheaper but at the same time they will die way much often **(making hunters happy)**.              
---
But what about throw away capitals, well thousands of rorqual alts are here same for not less capital chars with ships - this need to be addressed in different way.         
---
No, the game doesn't need more ships with fighters. Also, they'd essentially make battleships even less relevant, as they'd do more dps at better ranges and have better tracking.
---
Battleships need to feel more like battleships and not just cannon fodder for capitals, cruisers and below. They don't need anything else replacing their role or pushing them even further out of favor.
---
They vent heat.
---
True, but could you buy 200 rorqual/carrier/super/titan chars on every day - no.         
---
**There was no market supply for those**              
---
Like all my high skill characters except for main where bought from market - so i kind of know what i am saying.         
---
They had permission. 
---
On CVA's website, their overarching mission for all of Providence, Operation Delvierance, states that one of it's main points is increasing the economic development and prosperity of the region.
---
The Network were simply bringing forward their own assets, a Freeported Marketplace, to assist providence in a troubling time.
---
Maybe CVA have forgotten their purpose? Maybe CVA have *forgotten* OP Deliverance! They've not secured their space for over a year now.
---
Maybe it's time for new management!

Why do you want that time means something? Imagine for the new people it will be really harder. Skill injector is one of the stuff that can encourage new people to stay playing delve. Just rorqual are too powerfull. Berf rorqual by 30-40% yield, life will be better. Same for fighter application.
---
Well said!

Just set them to the keys 1 2 3 4 5 and run your finger across your keyboard :D

How does that impact torpedo battleships, sorry request denied.

Gotta keep the torpedo dream kicking on

It s happebing when there is no fax ;D

i think it may be worse. too many people see those two options are the only way to be successful and choose never to play the game instead.

i've played off and on for a total of about three years over the last nine. i've got enough PLEX and Isk on my main account to sub for a couple of years. But right now i'm not sure I want to invest the time i'd feel like I'd want to put in if I were playing.

Fuck do I miss those icons. Was much easier to tell what was what.

WE DONT TALK ABOUT LEVEL 5S

That's assuming heavy drone 4 with navy drones,  you already have drone interfacing 5 and drone nav 5 for the yeld.
---
And a capital cap booster/t2 invulns/panic.
---
I still don't fly dictors in pgl fleets. I do pretty decent with others but every time I hear that rage from "this is really eve" and I go with something else. I didn't even knew about eve when that "two fucking dictors" happened :))

Sooo more bots?

Thanks for the clarification and appreciate the compliment.

and another rehash of a last year's event, but somehow worse and with more mining
---
i mean it's sad for the people who decided to hitch their wagon to destiny and got let down, but it's not sad for destiny because fuck that smug assclown tbh
---
I've literally never seen a super in catch outside of stratops. Two people literally got kicked from cap group about a week ago for dropping carriers on a dessie fight so yeah... Sometimes people are gonna do dumb shit, but we're usually just as unhappy about caps in catch as anyone else. 
---
^^ This! ‚ò∫  Getting shot at is what they're good for 
---
It's funny how injectors serve as an excuse to NOT make any balance changes to blatantly broken stuff.
---
I don't disagree that injectors are part of the problem. But that shouldn't give CCP (or anyone else) a carte blanche to say "It's fucked anyway so why even bother lol".
---
Caps have been oppressive for far too long now, and no change to injectors (or even removal) is gonna change that.
---
And now shitpost #420 suggests that 'caps shouldn't be nerfed but in the same time kinda should', meanwhile they should be 'cheesed out of certain areas but only for certain time periods' and anyway, 'caps aren't the real issue here guys'. Like what?
---
Anyway, just my perspective on the matter. I'm off dropping my one man small gang (aka Hel) on the next poor soul dumb enough to roam under my super umbrella in 2019! Ayyyyyy
---
how many people have injected into Rorquals in the last two years.   
---
How many Rorqual pilots have ever been sold on the Bazzaar?
---
i'm guessing the first number is at least an order of magnitude higher.
---
&gt;Newbie: "So what can I do here?"  
---
Veteran: "Buy a ship, undock, go fly around, get some gfs"  
---
Newbie: "I tried that, but most of the systems are empty, I went a long, long way from home, and ended up in a 1v20 engagement"  
---
Veteran: "Yeah, you gotta learn how to engage on your terms, dictate the fight, positioning and splitting your enemies are key, back in the day we used to go out, just the three of us, and fight fleets 5x our size, it was amazing"  
---
Newbie: "Fancy going out at the weekend and having a go?"  
---
Veteran: "Nah, I pretty much exclusively play PUBG, I only log on if I see a ping that the other Vets who never log in are dropping 100 Titans on a tackled Vindicator"
---
This is pretty much the only issue I personally have with capitals (as someone who does not have the SP to fly one I have seen this a lot). I know way too many capital pilots who won't login unless its to use it and use it safely.
---
I don't think they necessarily need a rebalance also, I just think they need more reasons to be used in smaller numbers, other than Ratting/Bridging/Citadel Bashing/Dropping.
---
Like, the only times I'v ever see one, its usually in a completely non engage-able super blob, or immediately cyno's in a fleet of FAX's.
---
Would it be so bad to add only 1 or 2 Supers to a fleet of BCs/BS's in order to multiply the force projection a little?
---
You don't get it Stainguy. Any subcap comp can be countered by other subcaps so I don't care what they inject into. I'll boosh, bomb, kite, dampen, neut, brawl or outmaneuver them. Every fight is a different problem and I've got a whole box of tools that I can use to solve it, that's what makes it fun.
---
Capitals don't work that way. They're immune to most of those tools and even the worst PVP pilot in the game can be effective in one. Every fight with them is the same because there are a literal handful of comps that can even stay on grid with them, much less beat them. That's what makes them boring and oppressive to everything else.
---
Wait, why the hell i should care about your grid?       
---
You need to come to me or stuff that i am securing.           
---
If you moving by gates it will be gate camp with anchorable bubbles.     
---
**Newbies try to tackle nano gangs - more 'aged' players simply hold a spot and force gang to come to them or move out**       
---
Like you never engage organized nano gang ... unless you are dumb or have better ewar than they do and more organized players (aka not splitting around).        
---
I truly want to see what your gang will do against my stationary / sentry / cruise Armageddons with T2 logistic ships in the middle ...  did i say that they have neuts and drone assigned to trigger?        
---
Have fun grinding 180k EHP on each of them - after insurance each of them cost less than a ceptor with faction point that you need to use.             
---
Will i kill you? Well this concept is not about tackling you but forcing to GTFO. 
---
-----------------------------------------           
---
Basically what i want to say - unless i want to camp a gate ... i will never pull this configuration to fight any one on their terms ;)      
---
Always fight on your terms. 
---
All of the skillpoints in injectors come from the same source. It's the same product, just in more convenient packaging.
---
Previously, all characters represented a monetary value invested into the game (i.e.  this 30m SP pilot account has been training for 1 year), which represented a controlled flow of skillpoints into the game through subbed accounts.
---
It's the same today - Omega accounts are the only ones able to generate extractable SP (arguably there is daily injector SP to take an Alpha above 5m SP but that also comes through PLEX purchase). It's a myth that there is an unlimited number of skill injectors available.
---
There is a slight convenience increase by virtue of not having to purchase a pre-packed character, but there is also an 'SP sink' involved with injectors represented through their diminishing returns.
---
The supply of hyper specialized characters on the bazaar is very limited. If there was increased demand due to injectors being removed, prices on those characters would skyrocket and price people out accordingly. 
---
&gt;No Emergency damage control for faxes and at the same time buff to dread EHP or emergency damage control 'work time' so even if someone drop 60 titans on your 60 dreads they can still kill something
---
None of these go nearly far enough, fax reps on supers need to be removed entirely (or people will just inject 3x the number of faxes and keep playing the same way!)
---
As for injectors: imo injectors just speed up how fast cancer metastasizes in the meta. People would have trained and built retarded assloads of caps and supers regardless, because they're way too good. Injectors just make it take 2-3 years less time to reach the same point we'd reach without them. 
---
In a similar sense, [modern] titan proliferation isn't the biggest problem with titans. Supercap proliferation became a big deal when the biggest supercap fleets became functionally invincible except against other supercap fleets. We probably crossed this rubicon in 2010-2011, in the age of RR supercarriers. The problem is, and has always been, the fact that these fleets have no counter other than a bigger version of themselves. 
---
Removing FAXes would actually hit at the heart of the problem. 
---
Who does Prodog think he is, CCP Fozzie?
---
Well base idea is to count the spool up time into the cyno cycle so when activated it will light itself no matter if inhibitor gone online during this time.      
---
It is only about giving time for reaction - like the cyno symbol is showing up but the cyno opens on delay so you know when to run.        
---
No, they allow other ships to refit off them because they have a (tiny) SMA, the same way other ships can refit off of capitals because they have an SMA. If Nestors could refit off themselves, caps would be able to do the same (they can't).
---
Also because you can't deploy a mobile depot while you're at a fortizar

Today skillpoints are generic. They can come from any skill and be injected into any other skill. Before extractors, trained characters on the bazaar were locked into whatever they were trained for which naturally limits the supply when the FOTM doctrine changes. It's not the same at all.
---
Would be a nice Nestor buff for solo stuff :(
---
Funniest part is when we crossed them at a gate, FC asked us to dont mind them. What we all did. 
---
You still harping on about this? You do realize nobody is buying this nonsense, right?
---
The only people who actually care what happens in Provi are Provi-Block and the pests that keep hanging around the fringes of the region, like you guys. And within Provi-Bloc these anti-Provi propaganda posts are a laughing matter, not something anybody is taking seriously. Surely your spais have reported that back to you?
---
So I guess I'm not entirely sure who you are trying to convince here.
---
you want to have competitive krabbing for sov?  the hell is wrong with you
---
That's where your mom fell.
---
Enough guys can afford to drop a few hundred or more bucks to skill from zero to capital pilot. The unfortunate thing is that whatever CCP changes the price of extractors to, people with discretionary RL money will drive it up and make it profitable.
---
And that's not really my issue with SP anyway. How did the rest of us survive for so long while having to actually train pilots into end-game fits? 
---
Why is it a good idea to have pilots buying their way into the end-game on day one (besides the obvious financial boon to CCP with extractor sales)? How does the game benefit from every new character being a potential instant cap pilot? 
---
I say it doesn't. Multi training pilots are a great idea but SP injection is just a shortcut to the end.
---
Wasn't GalNet actually the forums?
---
inb4 Civil War and a new break away faction.
---
reffed the shields while brawling. And forced tapi to cta to stop their market going down. Tapi bros you can make a horde alpha and check the ops board to know if you‚Äôre going to get blue balled just saying. 
---
If they doubled the yield on moon rocks that would fix it and all other t2 base costs.
---
I get it, simply you don't get it that capitals are here - **skills are injected, hulls are build**      
---
They are here and are not going anywhere.          
---
&gt;Capitals don't work that way (...) even the worst PVP pilot in the game can be effective in one.              
---
So what will change - instead of 2 people will drop 20 - like i stated without changes to New Eden ... changes to ships will be waste of time as new composition is found and people inject into it.          
---
You jest, but i once had 7 titans and numerous supers drop my 14 man corm fleet.
---
I miss my old blackbird. :(

Apparently my memory failed me; the cone is actually deeper than the room is high.

---
Limits to what skills could be injected, similar to how they limited what skills an alpha could train/use, would have been smart.
---
yeah, the target
---
I fail to see how it's relevant or caused by extractors that people can have "free" alt accounts. Those accounts get funded by other players, so what?
---
So you want to say that new people will have harder times to get in into a titan?      
---
So for years current owners will be hard to contest due to limited supply ?     
---
Yes, the current general safety is part of the problem.
---
Do I need to multibox this?
---
&gt;One of the major issues with capital ships, is the fact that pretty much every ship in game can fit a 2m isk mod that requires no sacrifice in fitting to drop unlimited numbers of capitals instantly.
---
wrong
---
At this point, marauders have their own issues. Doubt they will be looked at before a long time.
---
Upkeep is issue as if you go away to game ... why come back to endless bill you need to pay first.         
---
Also when i think about my bil ...... dam i need to sell my PVP ships ... like i have at least 200bil in them laying in every corner of New Eden. 
---
A super can cyno in, lock you and volley you in 40s easily. Combine that with sig bloom from MJD and you'll be pretty close to getting insta-popped unless you have some max resist fit.
---
Makes sense to me. Lots of modules have penalties while fitted unless you're using the right ship. Look at T1 Cloak on anything, vs T2 on a Covert ship of some kind. 
---
People buy nonsense out of the freeport fortizar market all the time.
---
Look another post in the r/eve sub completely unrelated to Eve. 
---
Once again, the moderators aren't going to do a damn thing and then I'll get downvoted to hell.
---
It's all fun and games except for the fact that we can't honestly admit to ourselves that the level of content on this sub has gotten worse and worse over the past year. You tell the mods they aren't doing their job and they just make butt hurt comments about how they can't be arsed to actually moderate........ then don't be a mod you fucking worthless lazy windbag.
---
#IT'S HOT DROP O'CLOOOOCK \o/
---
But where did i say i want to kill you?         
---
Unless this is a gate camp whole reason on using those i to make you GTFO. 
---
Good discussions usually start with counter arguments . . .
---
Except, before skill injectors, noone bothered to train 100 characters at once to sell on the bazaar. Probably because it took way too long to train them sellable quality.
---
Incorrect. The appropriate response is only a modest  10 molok's. You need to put the big toe in for you to get the perma rotating boson special
---
Same for 20 rorquals alts. They are paid.      
---
you didnt provide any arguments on why cynos r bad, you just said they are
---
cant argue against nothing
---
It's not a myth. Skill trading allows players to massively convert PLEX into usable SP via SP farms. Before, the SP entering was linked to characters, and yes while some people 'farmed' characters for sale, it still didn't allow the SP to be sloshed around from one FOTM build to another by paying CCP real-world cash. 
---
Skill Extractors introduced not only the balance issue of infinite respeccing, but also allowed ISK&lt;=&gt;PLEX&lt;==&gt;SP conversion that rendered the time-based control of training the most powerful ships in the game meaningless. Instead of helping players catch up, it just permanently cemented the lead of the entrenched players given the scalability of alts for income generation in this game. 
---
In practice, Skill Injectors are far too expensive for true new players to access. It's become a tool for veterans to add or reshape alts, or best case, for them to help to get new recruits up to speed. New entrants without such a leg up face a power gap greater than ever before. 
---
The only reasonable case for skill trading making the game better I have seen put forward is that it makes CCP tons of cash which they can use to keep the lights on and improve the game. Given though all the balance issues they have introduced and the inability of CCP to respond to them, you have to wonder if they weren't just a horrible miscalculation at this point. 
---
It was always like this - people simply docked back earlier. 
---
Think the point is skill extractors fund the account themselves.
---
So you can have any number of omega accounts without extra costs or even extra grind.
---
Wherever 
---
Do you know how this works, at all?
---
Some scammers post 24/7 and only hit a scam once in every few days. It really depends on the scams. You'd be lucky to hit the firesale scam more than twice per day even if you were scam-posting it non stop.
---
I can't really see how that'll help anything, seeing as caps are the real problem.
---
I completely agree, but I know people who do it as their main source of income with 60+ toons. This injects quite a lot of skillpoints into the game that would otherwise not be there.
---
Ultimately though, any solution to injector problem would require a nerf and that would hit CCP's bottom line so it's not going to happen.
---
&gt;People like you are what dilutes EvE. 
---
Wow dude. Fucking rude.
---
What if I told you a "catch up" mechanic is no where near as toxic to the game as your stupid fucking eliteism.
---
shut up dork
---
Don‚Äôt even try apply real world mechanics to eve.  ( 80% ships would get destroyed on undock ) 
---
But let‚Äôs play along. Fighter is an one person operated craft, but frigate takes 10-40 soul crew to operate.  So frigate requires to have halls, mess hall, living quarters, ship wide life support, storage and maybe some other systems to make ship tolerable to run and operate. Look bit in to eve lore. Fighter is just fully operational gun platform with short term flight. Without any requirements for life support. Now if you asking a fighter class ship then play valkayer, and pray Nordic gods that one day it will be intregrated to EVE
---
There are news concerning the possible steps to follow after tomorrow right in that article... maybe read it?
---
Your point, again? Your picture shows what could easily be a human. At no point was he able to scam people a full day. Not even once.
---
You've shown literally no proof whatsoever that this guy is a bot. Your picture only works against you.
---
Cynos aren't bad, the ability to fit them to absolutely any ship in the game and immediately get help without sacrificing anything is bad. 
---
If I want to fit a cloak, I have to make sacrifices. If I want to fit stabs, I have to make sacrifices. If I want to get instantly saved I should have to make sacrifices.
---
You know, like my opening sentence states.
---
Anime and furries. Sums up null sec
---
Defender/Attacker balance is the root of the issue. Being the defender is too advantageous. Jump fatigue is in part to blame for this, but so are citadels, panics, cynos, and a few other things.
---
I'm wholly convinced it won't change much either. CCP wants us laying bricks on our walls to defend against our enemies. It keeps us subbed by preventing major loss and working towards destroying our enemies. Of which will never happen because the defender advantage prevents it. The tension builds up until there's  a titanic battle of proportions that make the citadels irrelevant.
---
All the major leaders are doing CCPs work for them. Keep farming for the Titans/Supers/Fax so we can win against the bad guys. It keeps you subbed.
---
Jesus, just place this mostly outdated shit in the sidebar and stop reposting it weekly.
---
Best thing to come out of EVE
---
no thx lets move on to the next shit post!
---
Funny, cause the injector value formed itself around the cost to plex.
---
Right you nailed it, except that optimizations of the math form still brings out massive performance improvements.  But because software guys generally have no idea what it means to multiply by 2.5 instead of 5 (2.5 is two instructions on the clock, 5 is only one, the first instruction in both cases) folks like Intel and AMD spend billions making special functions that perform both instructions on the same clock, but with a complexity penalty that hits the system elsewhere that hopefully you don‚Äôt see. 
---
Parallel computing is still limited by the farm out and collecting of the results.  And when a single entity requires all the math applied to it, that‚Äôs forced to a single linear node.  
---
Every ship in system can get a node, but to keep the database in sync, and everyone seeing everyone else in the right spots, all the results still have to make it back to a single file on the tick and then nodes can pull your data out again.  
---
Now if you can figure out how and under which rules you can have multiple copies of the database in loose sync, syncing as needed across multiple files then you‚Äôll be rich.  
---
Not inebriated at all.  Should be at work...
---
Where is the plex store?
---
Somehow you still think injectors is for new players. While it's most used for new alts from old players.
---
The real issue is ppl crying on reddit instead of playing the game
---
At least it'll take a bit more involvement to mine in 1 boosting Rorq and 19 barges vs in 20 AFK excavator Rorquals, as they would be forced to move ore around every couple of minutes.
---
You can't skill inject experience and there in comes an element of the balance as an in-experienced pilot is more likely to do something foolish and learn the hard way when their ship gets smoked. Pre skill injector era you learned how to fly a lot of ships well along the way prior to moving on to the likes of Capitals, you learned how to fit them yourself and not have the situation now where pilots are told fly this doctrine and have no understanding of the why while a few Pyfa warriors squeeze every last ounce of a hull.
---
Either way the genie is out of the bottle now...
---
hahaha so true actually
---
The bazaar limited supply. Either the people selling were regular players just trying to replace a character (often not terribly focused) or they were people who committed to a character build and then had to have a sub running for months or years to produce the product.
---
I've bought and sold characters in the bazaar and the perfect character for your needs isn't usually easy to find and the ones in most demand go for a premium.
---
With SP injectors, you need only go to jita and you can bake a super pilot in five minutes.
---
Those toons still had to be created "the hard way." Someone still had to put in the work to make them.
---
just make certain skills not injectable. eez fix.
---
this way ppl can catch up on the essentials for isk making and ship of the line pvp but Limit it so subcaps and their specific support skills
---
I mean, it was just on the very occasion. Like, let's take a roaming FC and cheap ships and see what we can catch. Turns out that when we arrived, gf's in local already were exchanged and not much stuff to catch left. 
---
Jesus Christ is SergalJerk coming back plsno
---
What scrub region do you live in carriers have been cheaper than marauders in delve for a year now.
---
This is actually a great idea !!!
---
Why on earth should caps be vulnerable to subs? That doesn't make sense at all. 
---
Why would we GTFO if we can counter them? Why would we be running away from easy kills? Makes no sense.
---
Just the other day we were killing a carrier and they cyno'd in a Titan to try to Boson us. The carrier was in structure and we were all in 1k dps naga's. We decided to warp back in since the carrier was close to dying while under the nose of a titan and other capitals. We landed on-top of the carrier, melted it as they jumped in 2 FAX and left.
---
Jumping a Titan, attempting to boson and jumping in more capitals is a pretty clear "GTFO" message, but we had an opportunity to kill things. Why would we leave when there is a very easy kill to get?
---
Its the same situation as above, your 15 RHML typhoons or 10 VNI's isn't as scary as you make it out to be. If we have damps/range, we can counter you and farm your shitty alts.
---
NC dropped the hammer and killed all the fun FIFY
---
That's True GOTG Just arrived too late.

A T2 frigate cost more than a T1 cruiser, and no one is trying to claim that is broke.
---
Thank you for your input, I'll be sure to take your suggestion and "don't be a mod"
---
I fucking miss that side bar..... 
---

---
The damage cap baffles me. It takes 15 minutes to online the damn thing - yet 30+ minutes to shoot it. 
---
If you removed the damage cap altogether, would it be wise to drastically increase all citadels health or allow them to be repaired? 
---
Fax are overpowered so I am hesitant to say let them be repped. However, this change would bring them more in line with poses.
---
skill u retard
---
Whether alts or not, its new characters being injected into the game.
---
golden age of machinima movie making....before machinima went quantity over quality and lets plays took over.

Thank you! Usually I change my skills around a lot so I've never had this happen before but your explanation is enough

As was mentioned there is a Tags-for-Sec system now:
---
[https://www.eveonline.com/article/wanttotrade-tags-for-security-status](https://www.eveonline.com/article/wanttotrade-tags-for-security-status)
---
Currently, it is less than 500M ISK to go from -10 back to 0. That is a third of a month's game time and is really nothing, although I guess it could add up if you have many characters to pardon.  See the costs here:
---
[https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/sectags/](https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/sectags/)
---
True there is a difference but CCP don't care. CCP care about PA ü§£ü§£
---
&gt; Ultimately though, any solution to injector problem would require a nerf and that would hit CCP's bottom line so it's not going to happen.
---
Sadly, you're 100% right on this point. I suppose if they could figure out another income stream to replace it, they might but now they're just biding time until their new overlords are fully in control and have paid out the performance bonus.
---
Why did you assume that those people will come in subcapitals to fight you?     
---
Tbh I lost the track of thoughts but it was nice to have a civilized conversation, thank you good sir and have a nice day.
---
And I'm telling you that changing the relationship between capitals and subcapitals is exactly the "change to New Eden" that the situation calls for. Not a minor nerf to FAX tanking or a temporary "no-capitals" zone that everyone is going to avoid until it goes away. It's a fundamental design flaw that capitals aren't affected by any of the tools that subcaps have to fight each other but are even more effective at killing them, that's what needs to change.
---
Building Capitals the margins are no longer what they were, this is also reflected back into component and also BPC prices. If you want to stay in the capital ship market, then you can fair a little better out of making BPC sets but again not a huge amount. 
---
A better option might be to sell the BPOs and look at the T2 market perhaps and find a niche there? If you have a couple of alts it will allow you to scale your production.
---
It wasn't removed it was just made largely irrelevant 
---
The issue is that everybody can obtain the strongest ships in the game. They need to make an even stronger supercapital and this time figure a way to keep it from proliferating.
---
You're assuming the current owners don't lose theirs and have to get into line to get a new one.
---

Put it in context. Faux on field. Clearly part of a larger escalation. Again well prepared pilot. 
---
Literally the only way to solve your problem.
---
Lvl4 missioning raven will do fine
---
You too fella! o7
---
we didn't need the prostitutes or spirits
---
way too cheap.
---
&gt; why come back to endless bill you need to pay first.
---
I think the idea of payments is somewhat problematic (especially for immobile structures that already incur a regular fueling cost or lose their defenses) but it would be easy to cap the bill accumulation to something like .75 the current cost of a hull.
---
Maybe we could fuel capital offensive and jump mods. Keep the fuel bay full of blocks at X blocks used per day or the highslots or fighters become unusable and the ship has to take gates to go anywhere. If the fuel bay is empty, the owner needs five times the number of blocks to get the generators working again. You would need to move more fuel blocks around more and there'd be a penalty for not doing so but it would be less crushing than an empty wallet.
---
While I don‚Äôt know anyone who trained 100, I did fly with a guy training 30+ as carrier pilots he would sell as they matured. Now, none of them would be good x,y,z pilots when the meta shifts but perspective is key. People did train characters only for sale on the bazaar to make a profit.
---
Why do so many people pretend that the character bazaar never existed
---
No it doesnt. The catch up mechanic is that there is only a small number of skills that affect any given situation. It only takes a couple months, at most, to perfect any normal role or non capital fitting. The only advantage older players have over you is options.
---
&gt; An offensive group is already at a disadvantage at equal numbers. 
---
Tell that to hard knocks Keepstars who got blapped by 1000+ ravens when they couldnt get even 1/4 of that amount. Not to mention that offensive fleet got minimal losses.
---
EVE is lately turning into Quantity online - Someone builds most expensive and strongest structure in game and it gets destroyed by kitchen sink fleet of ravens, just because they managed to get thousands of them there.
---
This matter of quantity vs quality is all over eve (except WH brawl imo) and its biggest cancer of the game. If you are smaller entity, and you want to have your little place in K-space, you have to be completely invisible, which also means not doing many of those fun things eve has, because you might get blobed by bigger player who will beat you just by numbers ...
---
I talked to a CCP member at one of the events. IIRC, they told me that they had more money within the two weeks after skill injectors came out than they did in the entire prior year.
---
I have several screens from this era if anyone is interested. I know I'm not, game looked pretty crappy back then...
---
They are. For the vast majority of skills, 4 to 5 is a 5% difference. Actual skill at the game is far more important.
---
hey dipshit cynos are integral to subcap pvp too 
---
please can we have an r/eve balance submission requirement of 10k zkills minimum thank you i'm willing to mod if necessary
---
Because that was the strawman you presented.
---
&gt;if the new solution to any small gang will be rapid heavy missile Typhoons - people will have just 15 alts sitting on each gate.  
---
&gt;Maybe comeback to drones and assist?  
---
50 drones (sentry or light) assigned to a fast locking ship on each gate also can be issue for any roaming gang
---
Also, the typical nullbro trope of "i'll just sit my 15 alts on *every* gate" is hilarious and is not realistic in the slightest. Maybe when your bored one day, sure. But you can't setup your alts on a random gate that quickly 24/7. But, lets hear some more strawman arguments.
---
Regardless of your opinion of them or him, PGL has at least come up with a concrete list of what he'd like to see adjusted.
---
Which is a decent way to approach this kind of thing, rather than "X is broken!!! Fix it!!!" That approach isn't hugely useful. (Not useless, but not as useful) 
---
On the other hand, inflammatory language isn't a good approach. Even people who try to see the best in people, react poorly to being attacked. and that reaction will colour any interaction.
---
Preach. This rework would make blops almost redundant, given no buffs would be presented

One could argue that it puts a dampener on a variety of content that eveolves around cap drops.
---
Im not talking about titans blobbing roamers, but LSH dread bombing INIT in fountain for example.

Chance is such things won't happen anymore (or even more rarely).
---
Butthurt is caused by small gang noobs thinking they should be able to go straight to a null block, figh them face to face and win.
---
These butthurtborn people will never be satisfied because they will never ever be able to do that.
---
Truth is you can go with your small gang in null, gank a few ships, collect their drops and keep moving. Even better if you have access to their intel but not a necessity.
---
Keep moving, have someone scout and know when to leave. Guaranteed you will make a profit too once you get experienced enough and will get used to the areas you roam in.
---
Doesn't mean that the ability to instantly call in a cap fleet with no downsides isn't broken
---
Well, mod away because I meet those requirements.
---
Every race has their uses. Eventually you will be trained into all subcaps anyway. Do not think that you've wasted skillpoints, simply start training into things that will be practical in the future.
---
you say that, but its how it was for years when we had more players...

Yeah, that was it. That was a tanky proteus.

Dude the fact this game is still ticking is a bloody miracle in itself.

&gt; It's honestly that simple.

I have a bridge to sell you.

If you wanna know something funny, a horde pilot injected a titan to use as a bridge a couple weeks ago. Pandemic Horde. Injecting titans. What a year haha

a lot of stuff changed since you last played, keep an eye on them, but something is still the same, most notably
---

ganking is still pvp

It's fine mate. You wanted to betray us and you did. You don't need to try to dignify it or even explain yourself. We worked with you for years and you wanted to do something different, it's all good. You misled Vily in your betrayal and he was hurt by that, it's natural. It's more targets for all of us, for the price of an Avatar and a Nyx.
---
But as a result of skill injecting, there are more rorquals, so minerals are cheaper, and ship losses hurt less. I‚Äôve seen a rigged titan go for as low as 47b in delve! Probably have gone lower

[Hmm](https://youtu.be/J6Xp1rSd1Rw)
---
No upkeep while you being unsubbed, i have no better/fairer solution. It would have been a problem prior to skillfarms because many Titan Pilots would only sub when needed but today it will hurt you unsubbing your Titan Pilot while running a skillfarm.
---
Injectors provide a massive influx of cash for CCP. They also allow for new players to feel like they can catch up. Two very strong positives. The problem is unlimited injectability. I think if they limited it to being able to double your normal SP income per month or 1.5m per month max, that would change the landscape a lot. New rorqual pilots would take 4-6 months, not 1 day. New cap pilots would take more time and so on. A real titan pilot would take 6-9 months.

In the end Supers will be a more rare sithing and most of the fights will involve Subcaps and Capitals wich I find a good thing tbh.
---
If things continue like this you will start to see fleets with bigger numbers of titans then subcaps... 
---
I still make dedicated cyno only ships. That'll piss everyone off 
---
CCpls
---
50ish titans and 5 Faction Titans.
---
2 faxes.
---
When is someone going to grow a pair and bait these suckers for that ultimate slam dunk?
---
Except T2 frigates aren't complete trash.
---
I stage out of Kamela in the Amarr v Min zone. You can use hauling contracts to move your stuff out (like for example black frog logistics), or you can haul them yourself. It's reasonably close to both Rens and Amarr. 
---
Question is... wh as t would have happened here is a Rorqual was so fragile that a small gang could have killed it?
---
Would the other caps be baited or would everything not escalated?
---
Kinakka is a great staging if you want to stay in Caldari/Gallente FW space. It's like 9-10 jumps from Jita for easy logistics and reshipping capabilities and has a non-kickout station if you ever get yourself a JF.
---
Huola if you want to stage in Amarr/Minmatar FW space, you're like 4 jumps from Amarr and it also has a non-kickout station if you ever wanna do JF logistics.
---
Neither of those systems are constantly camped - there are gatecamps but not as much as like 2016-2017 - so you can even move your stuff in with a DST alt if you have one and can scout/web your way to station.
---
It's truly a lot of things. One module lets a carrier and a super carrier have the range of: the whole fucking grid. Not to mention how well that 3k dps will apply to pretty much any ship. A regular carrier's fighters can out damage ANY tank you can put on ANY subcap with the exception of meme brick tank fits.
---
I think there should be trade-offs. If you want your fighters to apply well, you should have to gimp yourself (LIKE ANY SUBCAP?!?!) in some way. If you want your fighters range to be 5k km then you should lose more than a highslot.
---
Tbh, I just roam black rise out of Jita to accomplish this. You'll find blobs but also a lot of good solo fights. Just set Tama to your avoidance list on your way in unless you want to die to an instalock camp and take one of the longer routes. If you pop, death clone back to Jita and fly out again. I personally find that few jumps through highsec gives me time to think about how to fight and win in whatever I'm in instead of just waking up in low and dying again without processing why I lost to begin with. 
---
If you desire to stage in low, akidagi isn't a bad choice (can't remember if there is an npc station there though). It's close to the action, one jump from highsec, and not terminally camped. Not sure about other FW regions bc I've admittedly only solo roamed BR frequently. Good luck and have fun. 
---
Yeah, Provi has come back - Same problems as ever in how it works, but I think that's fine. No-one really wants Provi to change, just for it to be around :)
---
My point is that CCP never intended for the return on investment from T1 to T2 ships to scale linearly.
---
Comparing the price of a T2 battleship to a T1 capital ship is apples to oranges, and not at all relevant.
---
&gt; Caring about killboard stats in 2019.
---
go on dotlan and find the most active systems in ls, then try to trace the closest route from them to the nearest trade hub (either amarr or jita prob), then stage on the first ls off of the route. Move stuff on a DST(of JF) and if you are planning on flying a lot of T1's just buy the bpc and bring the minerals, then build in system, the build will be a bit more expensive but T1 cruiiser down are dirt cheap anyway even before insurance. Places like kamela and its surroundings have the advantage of being close to provi as well if you wish to leave ls and go ns for some reason.
---
Some places while not very represented in kill stats are still to be considered for solo, asakai and its surroundings in black rise is still a reasonable system for it.
---
As a rule of thumb for ls the less active snuff there is on the region the better it'll be for solo/small gang pvp, cause even if plexes are able to mitigate the cap drop you'd still get less activity, treat it as the canary in a coalmine. That is not to say there aren't people in there looking for solo/small gang, its a statement on the aggregate.
---
"Tyrranic stance"? Please. Literally no online games that still make any income allow this, because then everyone would just play for free.
---
If you ignore everything else I said, lol. Let me rephrase, but bear with me, I'm typing this off my phone.
---
 I'm not saying that caps don't need adjustment, just pointing out that the problem of their balance was greatly exacerbated by both the ability to "train" into one within 20 min, and the absolute glut of resources provided by neo-rorqs making them trivial to produce. Any ship is powerful in numbers, and capitals are the most powerful ships of all (especially now with FAXes being a thing).
---
When ships designed to be high-value strategic assets become throwaway-cheap and easily accessible, well, we get the last two years of EVE. From what I see, its 3 linked parts to a problem. You can't just fix one and call the whole system fixed...
---
Nerfing caps alone will either result in more N+1, or shifting within a week to the next OP meta, depending on the type of changes. Also potentially kills the ISK faucet that has kept up with mineral generation, causing further drops in the mineral index.
---
Killing injectors leaves us with the status quo until other changes are made, and killing rorquals alone leaves the inflation generated by PVE supers essentially unchecked... Rip economy.
---
Basically, if these 3 aren't fixed concurrently, we'll just be trading a shit sandwich for a Turd Souffl√©, or at best stay where we are.
---
Skill injectors - damage done - already too many super/titan alts - but it would be good to see them being more controlled in regards to how they can be used.
---
Remove the possibility to buy Omega game time using plex - require actual paid subscription for Omega status. This will take care of a lot of the current problems including some of the botting. Sure, we might loose some players, but we'll definitely loose a lot of the super/titan/rorq/camper/bot alts around, that do nothing good for the game anyway.
---
you shouldn't need to web your DST for safe travel, just use the mwd cloak trick really
---
Post 'em, I'm Down.
---
you going to lose alot like this. Not sure CCP can handle that.
---
link character :)
---
What do you say that's a bad thing? If a group can hold space it's there space to play in.
---
You have a bad understanding of rights and ownership. If you solo in someone's krav space get bobbed.  People don't want you there!!!
---
&gt;it was nice to see NC./PL and even Tri stay and fight for a change
---
lmao this must be bait if your flair is legit.
---
You still don't understand how these scam work.  
---
It is true, that the contract history only shows the frequency of those contracts that were actually accepted (and thereby successful scams). It doesn't show that these contracts were in fact spammed 24/7 in Jita local (which they were).
---
There's two possible conclusions to make from the print screen alone: 1. The guy has the most insane sleeping pattern ever. 2. The guy is using a macro (bannable offense) in order to spam Jita local 24/7 and get such weird times where his contracts are accepted.
---
Due to the fact that I've looked through the chat logs of Jita local, and spent 14+ hours per day (at off hours as well, due to reasons) online in Jita local, I know he's been using a macro, and been doing it 24/7. At one point I had a trade window up where I offered him 1 billion for more than 40 minutes. No response. During that time he spammed Jita local with his scam contracts every 10-15 seconds.
---
Like I said before. Try spending some time in Jita yourself, and some time trying to understand how scam contract works. That way you won't have to make inquiries based on false presumptions and ignorance.
---
And at the end of the day. I don't need to provide proof of his macro'ing/boting to you or anyone else on Reddit. CCP has all of this evidence themselves, and I'm merely pointing out that they are allowing macro cheating in Jita local to go unpunished.  
---
This guy also isn't the only one. There's several of them scam-spamming with macros all day long, and have been doing so for months/years.
---
I use a DST and/or a Prowler as the situation calls for. A Prowler is functionally immortal in lowsec (you have to REALLY make a mistake or have bad lag)
---
A DST is good with a scout if you're worried. DSTs die to proper gatecamps but not much else.
---
After staging in Auga for several months I eventually got weary of the extra time, and instead prefer to just buy security tags on a regular basis (well, as regular as how little I still PVP), and stage out of highsec.
---
Even more stuff that can alpha subcaps will bring us salvation. 
---
You don't need to bring all the faxes in at the start.
---
yeh fair
---
Not going to lie I audibly guffawed
---
Haha jesus what a load of crap. Everyone knows how these scams work, you're not some kind of genius to figure them out. You're hilarious...
---
Lots of claims and zero proof. I'm waiting.
---
Just one
---
never showed market orders/transactions and industry jobs for me after the esi relaunch - not a single notification.
---
lawd, I hope this works out. but ccp like $$$$.
---
It's hilarious to me how much energy is expended here on this reddit forum, trying to come up with ways to nerf the cap umbrella in Delve.
---
&gt; and make it feel more enjoyable
---
They kind of forgot to make this part happen.
---
You wouldn't have 27 rorqs anymore if you cherry picked the good rocks in a new anom. Theta titans are thirsty
---
Those ratters seem to have scouts in my chain.
---
Yea you are not very smart are you?
---
Both sides are able to instantly call in a cap fleet.  I don't see what the problem is.
---
Thanks for the advice. I have heard much about Tama-pon in streams ;) I will have to scout akidagi. An NPC station is a must have. Ideal with a clone bay for obvious reasons.
---
Lies.    Tri s dead. 
---
PL / NC / TRI / SC were working together - which we knew about before hand. Was a great brawl though :D
---
Because capitals should be balanced irrespective of how few/many there are. 
---
This is good. Let¬¥s make sure CCP see this.

---

---
I am with you. I've been playing since 2003. 
---
 A lot of good stuff and  bad stuff has happened since then, mostly good stuff in the end as Eve is a great game overall. 
---
But PLEX and Injectors are the worst and ever since they came to be I have just gotten more and more sad of how bad it has made the game. 
---
I am both sad and angry that CCP does not seem to value what they have and had before this, and it is making the universe feel more disingenuous every year. CCP pls. You were the good guys.
---
still fake news - pushing this every couple of days on reddit doesnt make it any more true.
---
SC has killed plenty of our stuff, and just because the hate you more doesnt mean they are particularly friendly to us
---
Edit is what I've done. Hunting escalation in HS or the odd thukker mission for them cap bats. If you can afford it, you can do less ratting for your sec status using a concord ship. -2 is the point you want to avoid to retain easy HS access. Probably not an option for a solo pilot to get a c2 with c2/ls static or c1/3 with just ls but could look for a Corp with that infrastructure already
---
So you're just a shitposter and most likely one of those who scam, or uses a macro/bot.
---
Congrats. Won't be wasting any more time on you.
---
what about CCP is actually the bot?
---
I totally get where your at with empathizing with the actual team fighting bots. But if ccp as a company doesn‚Äôt commit the resources to keep their game in good shape, that‚Äôs on them. I‚Äôve said for years that ccp has established a wink and a wave approach to keep the bot subs paying them. Til they start fixing this and some other issues I‚Äôm winning eve.
---
Yet
---
Don't forget Pantheon and Iron Clad
---
More like you fell for a super obvious scam like a moron and want to get him banned. It would be really easy to prove that the bot was online 24/7, by just providing screenshots of all these trade/convo attempts you claim to have made.
---
But you can't. I wonder why.
---
Help/Support
---
Plex is not bad ... i like that my alts are paid this way :P but Injectors ruined balance  ... as one of the main EVE balancing factors was  getting stuff over time.        
---
You could not get 10 capital alts in 1 day ... no matter how much isk or plex you wanted to pay ...            
---
Yep you could do the character bazaar but if you got the chars no one else where able to do the same for quite a while.           
---
Years away.
---
Had to go through the Nex store first.  Remember Aur?
---
A single capital is helpless against small gang, even bunch of them can be dealt - the issue is that there are 100 other capitals ready to jump in.          
---
Nefring them will not change fact that there are 100 of them waiting to jump in as skills, ships already are here....
---
Raitaru* but I agree. My only concern is then you have to invest a lot more money to try to break into manufacturing. I think much higher or nonexistant damage cap would be better
---
Just price go up, like it has always did since plex exist.
---
If they buy it, it s because someone buy it before with real cash.
---
The game will shut down real before there will be no plex available.
---
One side will dominate and no one will be able to touch it.        
---
Like NCPL did it for years.           
---
hyperspatial shield buffer nid w/t1 fighters does the ungated ones fine @ 100km
---
LOL, leave to a carebear to turn PvP into a grindy way of making money
---
they're not the s-tier isk earners they once were
---
I didn't bother reading the OP, because it's StainGuy, but if you're gonna whine about super proliferation, at least whine about the thing that made the logistics of owning a super/titan 1000x times easier - citadels.
---

dscan of local by the time we were leaving.
---
Bring back coloured Neocom icons!
---
No capitals in FW space and much more limited usability in other parts of lowsec ( or the opposite and let only in FW use caps in some way)           
---
But i am totally all in for more restrictions in lowsec ... like way more restrictions.       
---
Yass
---
It is to late for this.            
---
While against the rules I doubt CCP are gonna ban you for a keyboard F1-&gt;F8 macro for smartbombing or w/e
---
Contract titan to alpha account while you are not using it.          
---
Keep titan contracted from alpha account ... constantly if you need to use it for some reason - just click accept.
---
&gt;That's how your outnumber your opponent   
---
FIFY
---
It wasn't just HAW's. It's also because you can't fight a Sov timer with battleships. You still see battleship fleets for structure timers and the odd end pos timer but it's just more efficent to use a Cruiser based hull now. 
---
Well not on every gate ... just entry to region. Times have changed.   
---
Sadly old hunters are now the prey.  
---
Plexing/subscribing, buying/injecting books, managing remaps/implants. It's not nothing.
---
If you wanted to create an efficient character, it took work.
---
Because you could get up to 10 capital chars per month (at best) at very high prices ... that someone had to train first. So the supply was limited. 
---
Not if they were to go on a recruiting push and pulled in 30k new people.
---
they have a very niche role possibly could be expanded and open up the possibilities but open it to much and it will be broken as hell
---
Just an track intro reference from  Atmosphere's Lucy Ford album. 
---

---

---
Que music.
---
You'd think if they turned that energy into actually playing the game, they might come up with something. Hell, The InitiativeDOT figured out how to operate under a hostile supercap umbrella with just subcaps.
---
Ehh that one paragraf about any player having a private capital fleet... Like what? Did you actually go through the numbers on that? 
---
In order for this to be feasible in the slightes you would have no live vni crab 100% of your available  free time. Then when you switch to carrier ratting the tempo can increase but you are no longer able to afk it. 
---
Like cmon the scenario you are painting is exactly the same as ccp Quant did with the 260mill tick.
---
 Skill injector are not the enemy, rorquals and bounty payouts are. The sudden "jump" in the amount of capitals and supercapitals can be easily attributed to long time highsec players moving to null and using 1-2 injectors to  jump into capitals. Why do players from highsec/lowsec move to null? It's safer then high sec and more profitable. Cmon that not sth. I should be telling you.
---
A Great Bunch of Lads, loads of pvp action!!
---
Joined in 2014, big disagree.
---
The time spent training taught me how to fly shit, starting with cheap stuff I could afford. Didn't stop me from joining a WH crew 3 months in, and let me actually play normally - there was no incentive to be a no-life krabber aside from ISK.
---
If I had seen injectors for 500M (inflation adjustment for the time), I would have probably said "fuck it, I'm not paying extra or grinding 6 hrs/evening to level up" and gone back to Sins or Forza.
---
I will never understand the hate behind injector/extractor, before we had character bazaar and it was the same..
---
He's not wrong though
---
brb smartbombing insured ships to pad my kb
---
I started at the same fucking time and I have no fucking problem that older players have more stuff than me.
---
For me the journey is fun. Engdgame is literally boring a f.
---
Own 10 capitals and undock them once a month? Lmao
---
What definitely grinds my gear is that people who started after me are in rorquals and titans while I am flying cruisers and bships.
---
I still remember the day I first saw a titan. Was fucking glorious.
---
If I got a titan now. Eve would be dead for me. 
---

---
this better for you?
---
Rude people on the Internet??
---
Oh my.
---
God damnit, why you have to poke holes... 
---
I forgot about alpha accounts but this can be solved by "you can't contract Caps to an alpha account". You can't fly it anyway.
---
Yeah sure. 
---
But old school RMT put aside, way back CCP actually cared about the universe and at least tried to protect the in game value of the ISK. This is ruined with Plex. You can just buy money. 
---
My pont being that making money should be made with you smarts, intel, working together and making ISK in cool and colaborative ways. Not with a credit card. 
---
I guess it has something to do with the new generation as well; time and effort is.. well effort, and not getting everything as soon as possible or actually have to earn it, is non existent in almost every game now a days. Call me old, but this is why I hate Plex. 
---
 I don't NEED to have a titan, but I would take pride in working together with my alliance to create something that big. Together, making that ISK and working towards that goal.
---
Not buying that goal.
---
Akidagi doesn't have a station and with the CalMil exodus the market Fortizar is also gone, but [Aivonen](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/system/Aivonen) right next door has a station. 
---
CCP endorses equal terms. Something that is offered out of the box as game mechanics is allowed, it's intended. 
---
Exploiting the game with third party tools that put yourself above all other players is not intended, and outright deserves a permanent ban without warning - not because of EULA, but because of the minimal (if not negative) value of such a player in games.
---
Injector damage had largely already been done. Easier to balance than undo injectors.
---
ah
---
So if someone drops say 60 dreads,  risking around 180b isk, (assuming 3b per dread)    they should be sure to get titan kills,  even if someone else drops 60 titans, risking around 4.2 trillion isk?   
---
(Assumeing approx 70b per titan/pod/fit) 
---
And this seems reasonable to you? 
---
This is the most advanced case of dinobrain I have ever seen.
---
TAPI really shouldn't be mention the concept of "feeding" about anything right now. 
---
I've been playing on and off since 2007.  If you want to tell new players the only way they can possibly catch up to me is to play for 12 years, at which point I'll still be 12 years ahead of them, well, good luck getting people to play.
---
You, him and 8 other "elite" players could stroke each other off over how undiluted the game is by yourselves

It's dash, not tack.

you didn't. BS were endgame and cap pilots were few.

If he's AFK he's not going to do shit to you...

---
Is there ever a situation where you'd finish 90% of the site, see the loot of the boss rat is shit, and walk away? Not likely, since there's a good bounty on the boss and he drops overseers personal effects no matter what.
---
Just eliminate AFK cloaking. If you wanna cloak, totally fine, multiple systems fine...  
---
But your fingers can do the work.
---
If they're cloaked and AFK, then they are not a threat. Something can't tackle you if they're AFK right?
---
You know you can also cloak up and wait for them to decloak too (as has been done with a cloaky titan, bosoning a bomber's bar fleet after it jumped in)? Also, the cloaky camper can't cyno a super/titan on you due to the same limitations put in place by a cyno. They can probably only BLOPs as covert cyno's would most likely not have the restrictions of a normal cyno (since you can't jump caps through it). So just bring your own covert cyno with a larger counter of T3s/bombers/recons.
---
&gt; the difference is that intelligence is being fed from actual players working together and reporting contacts 
---
TIL that Near2 is a player and not an intel tool/software.
---
&gt; So we‚Äôve had a whole slew of posts calling for cynos, injector, rorquals and supers
---
I am so glad that CCP does not listen to reddit. The trash is piling so much up in the main street of /r/eve, where the ocassional battle reports and pencil drawings are the only signs of intelligent culture.
---
Alright I'll give you a super secret way to beat carriers but dont tell anyone.....shoot the fighters.
---
I'm glad you aren't proposing getting rid of injectors all together.  Too many people get upset at CCP for trying to make money, but how else are they going to fund the unbelievably massive and complex get that we enjoy.  This said, I agree that injectors were a powerful addition so some changes are needed bring bring back balance.
---
I'm assuming they are supposed to be sensor arrays or maybe solar panels?
---
jesus mary and joseph
---
I buy and sell plex
---
I lived in lowsec with my main, and brought down stuff with a t2 indy alt, either small stuff in a Viator or bigger ships in an Occator. Was very handy, would do the same again.
---
/*goes on a wild ride down memory lane*
---
Yeah, I remember those days. My first Rokh was missile fit, because I didn't want to train Gunnery V, and my friend used a Minnie industrial to mine his way into a laser-fit Hurricane he called his "derelict Star Destroyer"
---
Fun times :)
---
So one afternoon of work at worst across the life of the toons before sale, really putting a shift in compared to injectors.
---
Not only havethis song on my head now, it is the perfect way to explain eve to kids
---
You are totally right. 
---
There are new players (1 year and under) who play for hours a day. They deserve something for doing that and keeping the population up.
---
Whereas, with out Skill injectors, a veteran player who only logs in once a week/month these days would still be getting the same advantage in terms of SP.
---
SKill Injectors is whats keeping the population up. 
---
yeah nice spin mate. this is nothing short of an anime betrayal no matter how much youre trying to deny it. you dirty scumbag.
---
Two inches?!?! That is hell for any woman at any speed...
---
Do hope you guys enjoy any criticism is appreciated.
---
Very constructive. Well done.
---
I feel there is a solution here and that solution is limited what skills you can inject in. If all capital skills and some higher end mining/leadership skills can't be injected then it will limit the proliferation of rorq alts and fast caps.
---
Unfortunately this would still take years for the effects to be visible.
---
I wish more people had taken a staunch stance against injectors instead of spinning silly arguments like "it's the same as buying a toon on the bazaar"  No point crying over spilt milk though, the damage has been done.
---
How exactly would nerfing cynos not a nerf to cloaky campers, again?

I've spent some time with CODE and I'm not sure you'll achieve anything even if you did manage to "infiltrate" them. Most of their members are multi-boxing gankers that only operate by themselves or a select group of trusted people they've known for a long time. I'm not sure there is any organization other than "hey I'm setting up a gank fleet come join" or solo players/alts going around ganking random miners. 
---
Its a very low cost investment to setup a gank and other than getting some inside info on where they're setup there isn't much you can do to stop them. I occasionally still join their comms when I'm flying around to check to see how many people are on, who they are, and where they setup. After a while you get to know what TZs people are active and what someone's favored strategy is. All of this information is also pretty easy to fine just by scouting ahead of you as well.
---
That's pretty awesome, don't put yourself down. Only thing I can see wrong is a bit of perspective issues but the overall look is clean and immediately obvious what it is.
---
I mean an obvious troll post is not constructive either, especially when it‚Äôs low effort 
---
I mean... all of those things could stand to be changed. I'm ok with the side-effects of injectors so long as the other slew of issues are addressed though, since the injector problems compound with all the other shit.
---
Fuck off, im getting sick of this argument.
---
The people who are making these arguments really dont understand how fucking difficult it is for a new player to get 3 rorqs, a Cap, a Super and a Titan.
---
Lets go to the extreme, For a Titan you still need 40 bil in mined minerals and 40 bil worth of injectors. Then they need another 40 bil to fit the fucker. 
---
Thats after they have spent 30 bil buying 3 rorqs and the money to inject them. 
---
Unlike the past where most titans we credit card warriored most people today are trying to earn them. 
---

---
Staging in a quieter system vs. in a busy brawling system is partially a matter of what fights you want to take.
---
In a busy system, almost all of the fights happen in plexes, sometimes on station undocks.  Staging there gives you the ability to get back into a plex in a new ship--usually one picked to hard-counter whomever just killed you--in time to take the same fight again.  You have a continuous stream of system intel from one life to another and, in a peak timezone, can go pretty much nonstop for a couple hours without moving.
---
If you stage next door, you have the ability to think about what you did wrong and how best to win next, but you lose that instant reaction.  You can, however, take fights on gate, and get more open or dynamic pvp content in addition to fighting in plexes.  Naturally, this changes your fits a little bit, so that maybe you don't want to load so many hard counters but instead some more flexible (e.g. dual prop) setups.
---
In this second option, if you are running an expensive clone, the extra gate travel DOES expose you to those smartbombing alts of people who fight in plexes and then tab over to try and bomb their opponent's pod on the way out.
---
I've done both, had fun at both, and generally switch between them.  That kind of flexibility imo is what makes eve solo pvp a unique and awesome gaming experience!
---
Also, forgot to mention, my experience with regions is that amamake/huola area is more EU tz and black rise (while still generally busier in eu than later) has more of a US tz presence.
---
I'm not trolling, but seems you are.
---
Yeah wasn't taking a shit at you or any lame shit like that. Just wanted to see if anyone woukd possibly catch the reference.
---
There's a big difference though:
---
\- Bazaar keeps the same number of high SP characters in the game, only the owner is different;
---
\- Injectors allow you to create many low SP characters in parallel and extract them to \*create\* new high SP characters.
---
Exactly, you could go buy a Moros pilot but someone else would be down a Moros pilot. The number of Moros pilots in Eve wouldn't have changed.
---
I kinda feel like the better solution to "there's so many minerals that any hull made with minerals is stupidly cheap" is to reduce the supply of minerals, not to increase the supply of other stuff. CCP was moving in the right direction when they increased anom respawn times. They just need to bump it up like 500-1000% more.
---
no GoBots?
---
forcefield 
---
If your not trolling, I am sorry for you.
---
Not really given after a point most older players are training a 5/5 skill which offers a minimal bonus to what they already have.
---
Injectors have benefited veterans more than new players as they have the resources to dump ISK into rorq/ratting alts much more freely than a new player can.
---
There are small exceptions whereby some individuals spend big real money to catch up, but these are a minority.
---
I was looking at injector prices myself recently as a friend of mine was considering starting the game. The price of injectors when converted to PLEX made the endeavour worthless. The amount of real ¬£ you need to spend to get a worthwhile SP increase is ridiculous.
---
If new player encouragement was really the deal then skill accelerators with limits on types of skills trained would make far more sense.
---
I mean, would it be too much to suggest people just stop bitching all day long on reddit?
---
His whole modus operandi is to leave characters logged in 23/7 so the defense force has no idea when or where he‚Äôll strike, he posted a while ago on reddit that he‚Äôll just attack a random carrier at 3am, lunchtime whenever - so as long as he is in system you don‚Äôt know if he is active or not. With current mechanics that is fine - when he drops batphone a response team and bridge / jump in defenders or have a cloaked Titan with a bosun ready - there are counters. If the suggestions put forth to nerf umbrella/cyno counters then he can basically attack and be gone before a subcaps fleet arrives. I‚Äôm not arguing to nerf hunter gangs, but any form of afk gameplay that disrupts players actively playing and has no counter is simply abusing game mechanics. If you are undocked you should be actively piloting your ship or risk it getting killed - afk vni‚Äôs are easy targets so too should afk campers. 
---
So the forcefield thing is still correct? I've not seen a single one since coming back.
---
This is my favorite u/StainGuy post. Agreed, there's no rebalancing injectors at this point, but combat can be rebalanced to make capital ships less of an "I win" button than they are now. 
---
And how exactly is he "catching up"?
---
Core skills take what, a month or two? Past that, it's no big deal to get into most subcaps save for blops, marauders, and command ships. A new player can pick a few ships to specialize and fight on pretty much your level within 6 months (oh no, how on earth will I manage with only 20% ROF instead of 25%). The much bigger distinction would be your actual in-game experience and knowledge.
---
12 years... Lmfao, maybe if he wants to 1v1 you in a challenge series involving exhumers, jump-freighting, PI, and sleeper exploration with flawless skills in each category.
---
&gt; Just price go up, like it has always did since plex exist.
---
In former times this was balanaced and healty as the rising ISK-Value of plex tempted players like me, who hate grinding because i do not have the time for it and want to have fun when online, to buy more PLEX with cash as it paid off for us. Atm this developement is spoiled by the fact that many of us who supply the PLEX with our cash opted out of this. That is why currently PLEX prices are rising even while CCP inflated the market with cheap plex from discounted packages ....
---
I still need some polishing and based on this thread to support a few more music players. I hope to make it public in a week or so
---
nvm it was turned off on my overview
---
Ya but u could just dd citadels in seconds and move on ezpz
---
I agree, cloaky campers destroys the much fun of the game, well its a good stratergy thing but it should be logged out if ur not active, or you need fuel for it, capacity or wathever, it must be nerfed!
---
Your apples to oranges analogy is bad, since apples and oranges are both cheap and good to eat and tasty.
---
Marauders are more like a poisonous fruit that is very expensive, and carriers are like oranges. 99.9% of the time people prefer to buy and eat oranges. since there is nearly no use for an expensive, poisonous fruit.
---
They don't need to play for 12 years to catch up. What are you training now 5/5 in a skill that provides a 2% bonus to something?
---
New players are more than functional in a ship of choice after training a skill to 4, which takes less or equal time than the 4-5 train.
---
no worries mate
---
That‚Äôs all i‚Äôm arguing for. If you are scouting for a fleet then you need to keep moving or get probed right? So why can I keep my afk camper cloaked in enemy space with zero risk of getting hunted with no interaction required. The whole aspect of it is you can report ratting carriers, rorquals, and other activity 23/7 at will with no counter to direct a fleet to targets. If you had to actually actively scout and avoid scout hunters then it would balance.
---
GalNet is the tongue in cheek term for space internet. It stands for Galactic Network.
---
Fun fact: Sovereignty Hubs are actually huge space modems.
---
The game isn't supposed to fair btw. That's the gameplay that is promoted. Trig ships are the response to carrier proliferation from CCP to it's player base. The real problem is op capitals. Triglavian could have a balance after carriers though, I think that is viable. 
---
Nice koolaid 
---
i know about the eve emulation projects, those are the result of years  of reverse engineering and prodding around to see what happens w/ the client    
---
it would be ALOT easyer if CCP would allow for official emulation projects, feeding the community the server code for the 10year old version (wich i doubt will kill the TQ playerbase) heck id love a Trinity server, just to see how eve worked back then as cruddy 240p yt videos dont tell you much at all 
---
Nothing to with "elitism" at all. I didn¬¥t start in 2003 so no elitism for me. And it¬¥s not rude, it¬¥s a simple fact. People that feel they are on a disadvantage because of some shit are just not needed in my book.

reset the clock

Do as you say not as you do, huh? Lol. All I did was make a suggestion in response to someone on reddit, exactly like you did.

I was poking fun at all of us my man. All in good fun.
---
Injectors may be one issue; but the fact remains that they are part of the game, and they do have many positives. The best option now would be to change the meta around what we have. I personally like injectors, as they open up a much better variety of play-styles across the board; but of course, the issue of proloferation now needs to he dealt with...
---
\&gt;only remapping once
---
I don't care. It is your space, you can do what you want there.  
---
The general membership of REQ and BRAVE in Impass always say "Go to Catch!!!! for good fights" to justify them camping in tech 1 frigs for hours or dropping supers on 2 month old destroyers in their own minds. In reality they do exactly the same in Catch so it doesn't matter where you fly. And if you want to completely destroy anyone with the sledgehammer in Catch that's perfectly fine as mentioned. It's just kinda tiring to see Catch peddled as some PVP content area when it's just a wasteland from the permacamped 9KOE to the entire east pipe where TIKLE drop supers on solo AFs, to BRAVE dropping supers on 2 tech 1 cruisers in the western pipe. And if you fight in GE- TEST drops a revenant on you. I'd rather roam Delve tbh.   
---
Group your modules ffs
---
Biscuits however...
---
&gt;  I‚Äôm not arguing to nerf hunter gangs, but any form of afk gameplay that disrupts players actively playing and has no counter is simply abusing game mechanics. 
---
He's not afk if he's killing things. He's disrupting your gameplay, just like people dropping carriers on everything in existence is disrupting my gameplay, or people using Near2 and afking botting/ratting are disrupting hunters gameplay.
---
If Goons can cloaky camp an entire region (Geminate/Kalevala) and then chest beat about their "organization", the same can be said about Mar5hy and his organization disrupting a larger organization. Don't sit there and pretend that Goon's aren't using a shit ton of alts to just park in these systems and are somehow different than what Mar5hy is doing.
---
In the end, all your posts are not focused on cloaky camping, its about Mar5hy ruining your passive isk income. This isn't a game mechanic concern, you just want to remove any way for people to hurt you and your "alliance's organization".
---
Eleven years later and it's really not that much different.  
---
The ability to just jump into any new doctrine comes to mind.  It would suck pretty bad to be stranded in Crucifiers or intys or some shit in most doctrine fleets.
---
It's not like injectors are exactly easy unless you credit card warrior that shit.  You still need to grind the isk, which even with a rorq or two, takes a decent amount of time.
---
And credit card warriors pay the bills for CCP, so I don't think they are going to get nerfed any time soon.
---
Maybe ask some Rorqual Miners how to minimize input needs for these 40 Keeps so you can fire simultaneously ...
---
You can't possibly be this dense.
---
Making 18 more dudes appear or boxing 9 more carriers for that example would be great for the small gangs. 
---
Yeah if you do get that many people together then you will haze us. Chances are that you don't have that many people ready and willing if you only had two before. Plus you're introducing far more human error and required coordination. 
---
The whole "they will just drop more" argument is such a worthless angle. Op ships are still op. 
---
I run them in an algos active rep on my alpha. Started as a cheap fit, as I found more 3 and 4/10 drops I upgraded it. It's not the best but it works and has made over 2 bil in my handful of times logging in that char
---
I love these videos. They're such high quality its amazing
---
Maybe instead of crying on reddit that your solo or 5 man gang cannot kill stuff should learn the mechanics and make some friends. Eve is a game about friendship and teamwork and flying spaceships. If you want to sit in your 5 man bubble and stick your fingers in your ears go back to highsec or biomass (ingame).
---
People keep saying that trigs need to be this strong in order to stand as a counter for overpowered caps--but isnt this how power creep happens? Moreover, their strong point is tanky dps--what part of their anticapital power requires the tracking that they have currently?
---
A lot of doctrines are T1 ships these days. Caracals, Feroxes, Megathrons etc. They have a minimal training time. Even so, I can remember in the days of Ishtars online I flew a VNI for ages until I finally got into an Ishtar and it was no big deal.
---
Additionally have players learn harder roles like tackle and ewar is no bad thing.
---
Grinding injectors scales the richer you are, hence it doesn't benefit newbies but instead benefits bots and hardcore farmers.
---
funny fact. everyone was claiming that CCP should decrease the yield of regions that as a huge coalition you cannot live in one region... and now you already want to buff the yield?!?! wtf
---
Alt is cheaper, JF is more convenient. A cloaky hauler can go a long way if you mostly fly frigs since you can haul 3+ of them with an agility fit hauler. My viator alt aligns in 2.68s with 2.3m SPs. Anything short of an instalock camp isn't an issue (I use cloaked alt as eyes on high-sec gates that are camped often.)
---
In FW lowsec there's also the option to live 1 jump out in high sec. That way you can cheaply contract a freighter service to move stuff in bulk. JF price really racks up.
---
At least these icons were easy to identify.  The new ones don't give much of an idea of what they represent, and multiple are similar leading to more confusion.
---
A good way to clean this up is to sketch a straight line where the middle of your ship would be. As they all tend to be along a straight axis it's easier to observe when you're going astray
---
You are an idiot, no matter if risk averso or not. But as you already outed yourself as Rorqual-Multibox in Delve, i guess you are the risk averse version that only "pvpees" in 10%TiDi with all your other injected Bros, that would die horribly if they had to do anything alone with the big toys ....
---
Dirty horde bloobers in 2019. What has eve come to...
---
&gt;Core skills take what, a month or two? 
---
I'm still training core skills.  Isn't AWU 5 like almost a month by itself?
---
&gt;(oh no, how on earth will I manage with only 20% ROF instead of 25%).
---
In small gang/solo (which, IIRC, is what every new player should be trying to do according to this sub), 5% ROF is a big deal.
---
Is that the jukebox icon at the bottom? 
---
Seems to me people choose to ignore the problem with injectors, instead choosing to bitch and moan about Goons.
---
I can make up a quote and laugh at it too, watch,
---
&gt;remapping takes a long time to do
---
this makes me really wish this game was good
---
To my understanding, macros in-game and out are allowed as long as you respect the 1 input/action rule. So if I were to use PowerGrid (for example) and set it up so that one button press launches drones, another broadcasts for shields, etc... Doesn't matter what it does, so long as my single input doesn't trigger more than one action in-game.
---
injectors are not a problem, never were, never will be. the only thing injectors allowed is faster feedback when something is broken. period!!! 
---
also, look at subcaps, that balance is healthy like never before... is it because of injectors? no, it's not either!
---
I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it if you‚Äôre just starting out and only have t1 guns, at least unless you‚Äôre going to be flying as bait for other people. You just won‚Äôt be able to win a 1v1 fight without at minimum t2 guns and the appropriate frigate skill at IV, along with decent support skills. 
---
I‚Äôd recommend either finding a group to fly with to make up for lower sp if you want to do FW, although I‚Äôd also recommend looking into the big nullsec corps like Horde or Brave
---
even ccp stops using the default overview 2.5 minutes into the game
---
How about, you lose a titan, you lose 5m SPs. You lose a super, you lose 2m SPs. Randomly distributed in skills that were needed to fly the ship including at least 1 level of the ship skill itself.
---
Lost a titan? Oops, you lose spaceship command 5, sucks to be you.
---
I constantly misclick the assets/ship tree icon all the time
---
You prolly dont know what the 3 shells do either, eh?
---
There's definitely parts they've taken from other video content. Near the end of it, a target is blurred out in the overview. I wonder if it's from a YouTube video?
---
Eve is so pretty :) They really show off the beauty well while making it clear that for the most part those are real gameplay moments. Love it!
---
&gt;i don't want nerf to injectors as it is to late for this
---
Its never too late.
---
What do you use the ship tree for? I remove half the neocon stuff, leaving just assets, maps, corp, market, wallet, channels, people/places... Think that's about it.
---
An awesome ship. Lovin it : [http://prntscr.com/mecb8q](http://prntscr.com/mecb8q)

It was an awox so to speak, hours before the chimera died that pilot was in the same Corp as the dessie pilot, and they bashed some wormhole structures. Nothing to see here, move along

How long did you farm missions?
---
The cat can get back in the bag quickly if they want to. It wont happen because the right people dont understand the issues.
---
Nah, thats behind that door...
---
I feel like you forgot what it's like to be new to this game.
---
So I'm training skills for a Raven to get my belt ratting ticks up, but we just added an armor/hybrids doctrine, but I've specialized in shields/missiles because we had been flying Drakes, and I'm still having to meta a bunch of shit because I don't have AWU 5 yet and so on and on and on...
---
And now, 12 years later, you're shopping for that meta mod, but no one has one because everyone trained AWU 5 back in 2007.
---
I mean, we made it, but how many more would have made it who didn't if you could have just injected something really quick and not suck so bad.
---
That‚Äôs fucking impressive.
---
Thats what they want you to think.
---
All of the above
---
Because I don't have to.
---
And no, I didn't fall victim to his scam. I've fallen for scams in the past, but that was years ago.
---
This comment makes me feel like someone finally understands me. 
---
So for those playing at home, we are up to multiple days
---
At least 200% of your original estimate! You disgust me.
---
Also remove bosons, space superiority fighters and haw guns kthxbai
---
Surprised they didn't show a vni orbiting a Haven as that's most of the gameplay lmbo
---
20s isnt remotely enough. Not even sure if a BS can target a cyno frig in 20s.
---
Cyno needs a minute delay.
---
both halves fell down the hole though
---
No we're still on one afternoons worth of work over the lifetime before you sell, for some reason you seem to be arguing against yourself at something you said.
---
Fuck snuff
---
There are reasons they dont come here and tell us.
---
All the Hacking sequences seem to be of the Test Server :Thinking:
---
Also atleast 2x times Capitals in Highsec. LIES! 
---
But not the worst Introdcution ive ever seen for a new player
---
 "never were"
---
I remember when I could look at a character and go, "dude is too young to be a cyno, possibly eyes but no cyno" 
---
the moment they were introduced they allowed people to jump years ahead in training in an instant. Shockingly, I know, this affects playerbase capabilities which, in turn, changed gameplay overnight in an irreversible fashion.
---
Not a whole lot really, sometimes just to browse. Perhaps should do the same thing and remove from neocon
---
Nerfing the imbalances is very good for the game.
---
It would be easier, however, if they stopped pissing away capital, manpower and time on dumb Hilmar projects that end up getting cancelled.
---
what? 
---
Why are people still playing this game after CCP let the goons take over?
---
I think Sheltark said it best and most eloquently:

tell me on this BR where Snuff touched you https://br.inyour.space/?s=2392&amp;b=8457180&amp;e=90&amp;t=ub
---
High quality shit
---
Character prices were inflated much more on bazaar back at the day - it wasn't just the cost of books, the intangible cost of time was added into the price of the chars. Overall characters are cheaper now then they were prior to injectors, in some cases much cheaper.
---
Kind of iffy to compare Marauders with Carriers. Here's what I think; Marauders are even more than a buyers market than caps are. They're expensive to produce and they have a rather limited field of use, and even then they're often outclassed by other options in terms of cost/performance. But I agree; they need to be cheaper to build, as right now, they only appeal to people who really want to own it.
---
i agree? I think?
---
Yep. Remove local, faxes, asset safety. 
---
Wouldn't change a thing, injecting that back up compared to the price of titans would basically not change a thing. Might as well increase the (mineral) cost of titans and caps in general ...
---
yeah if you do roll back go back to day 1 and everyone start from scratch but giving dominace to a group to make them feel valid fuck that
---
Also, lol, nice job.
---
I'm open to the idea as long as covert cynos are exempt. They relate to a totally different class of ships (which are mostly glass cannons anyway) and the hunters need to have tank to survive rat/krab aggro long enough to light up. 
---
When I left in 2013 caps were only being used to dunk other caps or flat out prevent escalation. Knowing you can feasibly hold your own in a solo carrier against subs sounds so fun to me. 
---
I always love when people try to tackle me on stations in Stain just to get WTF is happening seconds later.     
---
next time just jump straight to "I didn't bother posting"
---
thanks
---
&gt;So I'm training skills for a Raven to get my belt ratting ticks up
---
I've read enough
---
who cares
---
leave that alliance then
---
No this should not be balanced at battleship size :D       
---
Also you have 20s to move out out of scram range and guy that is lighting a cyno cannot move at this point. 
---
Absolutely. Did something similar to a geddon after I managed to lose my first Rattlesnek

This is what it sounds like, when a corp dies.

Dude, you definitely don't remember what Eve was like back then.

Ravens were the shit for belt ratting before the big torp range nerf.
---
Rused by flairbait my man
---
No i simply say that there is no risk to 60 titans that drop on 60 dreads - and this is bad. 
---
I imagine it isn't that bad with the new social boosters

Around 1/2 way down, in his adversity apostle, repping his snuff fleet mates Kappa

He isnt wrong though. Thats some trash leadership, i think everyone agrees with that

how about a hard server reset for everyone? :P
---
hey its a spicy br and i got DDed for the first time last night by nancy. and lost my first cap so im pretty happy
---
But why? If not contract it to alpha ten drop to corp hangar ... and pickup by alpha char for safe keeping ...

Hilarious.

Welcome to character bazaar, pre injector. For the *right price* you could purchase a character near what you desired, and then spend a month or two polishing it. 
---
For the right price.
---
&gt;SKill Injectors is whats keeping the population up. 
---
But the population is smaller now.
---
Been binging on DS9, could you point me towards these vids?
---
But, but, this doesn't fit the 'supers and titans are op' narrative!
---
Yeah if he is referring to being trash as in the guys leadership this is FUCKING TRASH
---
well he may have been shot by his friends this is snuff
---
WTF i reply this like 5th time here.    
---
ON CHARACTER BAZAAR THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH SUPPLY.            
---
Like first someone had to train this char then decide to sell it.          
---
Sure there where people dropping chars often at later stage as this way they paid for the alt accounts - but it was - hey i have 10 chars for sale 10  ... once every year.  
---
Quite a long time unfortunately. I could have sped things up a lot if I knew more than I do now, and waited for the Xmas Potency-75 standings booster.
---
ended up grinding something like 100 level 1s and the amarr epic arc to get under -2.0 standings so I could run level 4s, from then on it was a lot faster. Probably spent something like 25-30 hours total I guess. 
---
Look at his Overview at 00:50, there is a Ph√∂nix in Rens
---
I feel bad for Stellae - they have eager members who are usually keen to give a fight when you roam their part of Querious, but they seem to have some really insane parts in leadership
---
serisously i like this hahahah so fun :)
---
The only reason you keep posting that is because you secretly want injectors.
---
The intention was to help new players. There is no reason why capital skills should be injectable. Arguably t2 ship skills shouldn't either.
---
not as good as the old trailers.....just sayin
---
If you VNI rat then you do it wrong.           
---
250mil/h in higsec by running incursions of burners (with additional pullers)               
---
How much VNI makes ? 60?  
---
Double this on running burners in guristas.        
---
100-150mil /h if you are salvaging after a super or 2-3 carriers with the use of MTU. 
---
If you nerf cynos you nerf cloaky camping.. since you are not scared of the instant cyno.
---
&gt; .. In the spirit of exploration and mystery new content and experiences are constantly introduced into the universe ...
---
Uhm? ... No?
---
I'd really like to see new content that is targeted at explorers, but that right there is just empty words.
---
"have benefited veterans more than new players"
---
"have the resources that new player doesn't"
---
pretty sure the resources required to get an injector translates to $$ just as easily as isk - the amount of time spent playing the game has no relation to your real life spending abilities (unless you get fired for gaming at work). I mean, if I started EVE last week and made a wish list of the ships I want to fly and had no wife-inspired spending limitations I could buy PLEX, sell PLEX and buy injectors. In fact, since I had little to no baseline of SP to begin with my # of injectors needed would likely be higher than a veteran player to reach my desire endpoint. So, not sure what you are trying to say here.
---
Unless of course, you have statistics to support your argument that "most older players are training 5/5 skills", "some individuals spend big real money, but this is small exceptions only" - I certainly haven't heard of people topping off LVL 5 skills with injectors (minimal return for large purchase). I mean this is basic psychology and economics.
---
making a actually usable overview default would probably be one of the most important changes to get more players in this game
---
you have movie to titan kill?
---
"if you make space have risk you need to compensate us"
---
no. fuck you. biomass. 
---
Guess they should really cleanup on singularity before recording. 
---
The injectors are not that bad for the game as injectors farms. People should not be able to farm injectors whit 100 more characters.What if you can extract your sp's ONLY if you have more then...lets say  100mils? I'm pretty sure that will kill the farmers because even if they inject to that point,,they will need years to recover the investment,and this  will help the vets who don't need sp's anymore.
---
Remove malus of SP getting injected by skill injectors, but limit them to max 50 mil SP.
---
so you can get some ships at the first day, but not all.
---
I chuckled when I saw the goon refinery and the narration talked about "The gathering and refinment of resources"
---
&gt;I certainly haven't heard of people topping off LVL 5 skills with injectors (minimal return for large purchase)
---
Of course not you dolt, because you use the ISK to inject another alt into rorquals.
---
That's why it's benefited veterans more - because they already had the disposable resources (ISK) to buy and inject more alts to further increase the scale of ISK production.
---
Few people buy injectors with real money, they're massively overpriced for the gain. It literally runs into four figures to inject a rorq if you buy them with real money.
---
You've completely misunderstood my argument.

But this is not a sustainable path. If the koreans want blatant p2w, should we take no issue with that and dismiss it as "just business"? It doesnt address the issue.
---
Why should people be entitled to having access to end game ships immediately?
---
&gt;but we as a society encourage it so I'm not sure why it is so hard to understand. 
---
People like you do. What is your point?
---
how do i do this?

He should be more upset about the amount of caps they lose getting dunked while ratting.

It's not a policy that will work everywhere, but "don't yolo through highsec when we're wardec'd" seems pretty reasonable to me. Feeding to wardeccers is how you get perma-dec'd, which is probably worse in the long run.
---
CMvan46 hit the nail on the head regarding the Astero.
---
I wanted to point out that WH exploration is actually much more difficult than lowsec exploration. The vast majority of WH data/relic sites are going to be full of sleepers, so finding one you can actually hit is rare. Combine that with the fact that a lot of exploration hunters love to sit in a relic site in cloak and wait for someone like you to show up in an uncloaked Astero, and you're begging to lose your ship and waste your time.
---
Lowsec exploration is much better in that you can see who is in the system with you immediately upon getting in, and if you hit the right systems at the right part of the day, you can go through a bunch of systems without ever seeing anyone. The only thing you'll have to worry about are gate camps, and a T1 frigate with optimized align time and warp stabs will be able to beat most gate camps if you're paying attention and not autopiloting or something stupid. As long as you have DSCAN up you'll be able to see combat probes if they get launched, so you should be able to remain relatively safe in lowsec. 
---
As for combat performance -- an Astero is way way way too expensive to utilize in that role. If you're looking at something to do highsec combat sites but still have the scanning and hacking bonuses, look at a Stratios, but they're up in entry-level battleship range for prices now. If you're looking at something you can use to take down other exploration ships, Stratios is also a pretty good fit for that role, though if you lose it it will hurt.
---
I'd recommend using your preferred race's T1 exploration frigate and keeping it simple and cheap. Yes, it makes hacking a little bit more difficult, but not impossible.
---
Also -- regarding sleeper sites -- you want to avoid those in most cases. An Astero can do them but there's very specific things you have to do in those sites to avoid death, and a lot of recommendations for skills and stuff are Omega-locked (such as T2 analyzers). 
---
Those players kept the game alive for a decade at least.
---
It is balanced. No change tewuired. When baddies enter system to attack (based on cloaky intel) you warp away.
---
Nothing wrong with cloaky scouts. Nothing wrong with cloaky hunting.
---
The counter-play is to rat in ships that can handle cloaky hunters, or rat with fast response backup, or to pay attention to intel and local while krabbing and warp out when threats are incoming.
---
The real reason you want CCP to change cloak mechanics is because you're too lazy to counter smart gameplay.
---
Goons defending thier content reserve i see
---
Longer anom respawn times isn't a buff. I'm not sure if you were meaning to reply to the guy above me or if you didn't understand what I was saying.
---
Yeah with the Social Boosters it's much easier, Angel+Guristas literally takes like 2 hours max now. 
---
You think capital ships are there for new players?
---
Your problem is that you dont agree with the concept of "endgame content" and "progression". This might not be the game for you.
---
Marauders aren't especially expensive and incredibly niche? Carriers aren't quite cheap, versatile, and effective?
---
How do cloaky campers remove much fun from the game?
---
&gt; Backstab their mothers to get a kill..

---
There's a difference between "Don't be dumb during wardecs" and fining people and publicly shaming them when they are dumb during wardecs.
---
Some people take themselves way too seriously.
---
Should have read: "WARDICK" although I think he meant WARDEC.
---
Off grid links were once part of the game. Where are they now?
---
Null Bears are just too much. If I was CCP I would nerf cloaky camping right now and then immediately after that Remove Local. 
---
It's less of a trailer and more of a game overview ad
---
Doesnt solve the problem.
---
how do I do this in the domain region?
---
50mil sp is like 10-15mil above focused titan char. 
---
To offer one example of a type of nerf that might be helpful (might!): removing the NSA.
---
Once a carrier gets cyno'd in, I have seconds to get off grid before the carrier itself is applying tackle and dps to me, nearly regardless of what type of ship I'm in. Without the NSA, that time gets multiplied. I still have to leave grid, but now my engagement toolbox is expanded to include ships that might need 10 seconds to extract after the cyno goes up. For this kind of change, I don't care that 20 carriers will come through that cyno instead of 2.
---
Fab use of game mechanics, really enjoyed your other video!
---
TBH i assumed that you link Headliner. 
---
Again you are looking it from the perspective of an older player. Burner Missions, incursions require months of training of skills as well as some basic knowledge of the game. Your points against skill injectors are only valid if you have the case of 4 weeks old mains sitting in carriers. That's simply not the case. The injectors make symptoms worse yes but again bounties and rorqs are the underlying problem. 
---
"Few people buy injectors with real money"
---
m8, massively overpriced is a relative statement. as a broke ass college student my perception of massively overpriced was radically different than it is now. for people not poor IRL, time is money. I pay for PLEX (isk) to avoid having to do dumb shit like mine or rat.
---
Having isk is not a precursor to any course of action, because isk is easily acquired using $$. In fact, the people injectors are geared towards are, coincidentally, the same market that would rather spend $$ to get isk than time. Also, coincidentally, this is the customer segment that CCP actually makes the most money from, so that others can multibox their rorqs (paid for by selling minerals and buying plex) and buy injectors (paid for by selling minerals) - these "others" doing nothing for CCP's bottom line except inflate player numbers and provide an outlet for the PLEX and injectors that others buy for $$$.
---
Logic... its a helluva concept lmao
---
eve looked much better back then, icons were easier to identify, background nebulas looked 100 times better
---
what allowed to be so huge problem ?  and the circle closes
---
Nut up buttercup
---
Good info, I will take a look tonight when I get home. Thanks.
---
The goons took over the entire game? There is no possible way to enjoy the game anymore? And how exactly did CCP let goons take over? Goons just exploited rorqs and their region better than anybody else in the game. They also have the most members and best infrastructure outside the game by a country mile. Those aren‚Äôt influenced by CCP. 
---
Ahem.  
---
New data-sites spawn every minute of every day.   
---
What more do you want? 
---
Fairly good suggestions overall. Which means ccp will listen, and then announce a new sale on skins.
---
&gt; you f*ck off

One thing that hasn't changed is what they say in local

You've been playing longer than me, can fly bigger ships than me, and here I am telling you to quit crying like a little girl about muh big ships. From a guy that can't fly anything bigger than a cruiser: you're a whiny entitled brat. 
---
at 06:05 is a name blurred out? o.O
---
Good idea, I plan on doing T1 frigs for a while.
---
Yes please
---
its one of the worst things ive ever seen
---
I play mostly in lowsec with a small corp, so goons don't really effect my gameplay. I still have lots of fun doing solo or small gang pvp, pve, exploration or just chatting with my friends in-game. I don't care what is going on in null with the big null alliances. As long as there's stuff to pew pew, I'm all good.
---
I care
---
Monnie McMoonface
---
You don't have to. Just like no one has to take your claims seriously.
---
Good old armour BS brawl there; disappointed my expert moonwalk to safety wasn't featured :)
---
Oh good point. Forgot to mention I‚Äôm EST time zone with the standard evening hours.
---
Would you rather spend ¬£215 or 28b ISK?
---
Even without injectors the bounties and rorqs would be a huge problem even though it would snowball way slower. Especially considering you either have 4 vnis alts doing their thing or 1 ratting super that you were able to purchase either way before. Rorqs on the other hand without skills injectors would be still overpowered AF and the demand for rorq ready characters on the bazaar would simply rise. Where there is demand there is supply. The n+1 nature of rorqs is the problem here not the ability to have multiple of the in the first place (dual boxing ratting supers for example is not fun id guess even though you could, once you reached a certain breaking point have multiple of those. ) 
---
Uh, no we're not? You need to log in to remap.
---
Seriously, I had no idea nihilism was a game dev philosophy until observing the CCP dev cycle for the last few years
---
all terrible ideas
---
theres not really much wrong with cynos
---
Well, I answered the question only from my point of view. I understand that there are different opinions and that goons and other things have a positive or negative effect on their gameplay. 
---
imagine caring this much about your alliance killboard.

Didn't try to hide the mobile depot spam in Jita at 04:40
---
This was all predicted in the very first thread where they announced them. I don't see anything new you are saying here. Why the whine now? Maybe you should have said something when it actually mattered.
---
Gatekeeping.
---
If you were even at the first Keepstar super fight you would have noticed how fast The North pulled away from Goons. It was 2 to 1 for most of the fight. I was literally on the Goons super fleet. Your only strategy was "Supers jump to cyno" that's it lol. You literally relied on numbers and the The north used things like panics to save their supers from DD alphas. You only started to catch when the north started to evac cause they weren't gonna win the timer.
---
I'm going to say it again. Your only strategy with your supers was literally to jump as many as you could into a very very special spot you probably planned long and hard about. 
---
&gt;Exception to this rule will be capsules
---
i found a loophole: just buy a bunch of expensive implants and whelp is so that you dont have to pay the fine. #4Dchess
---
damn that dual rep armor rag, what a meme!
---
The real question is when are we going to get T2 titans? 
---
My thoughts:
---
First and foremost, the direction you should head in is to do whatever you enjoy doing. You can make money in a bunch of different ways in this game.
---
For exploration: I have no idea who told you that, but I can attest that I've personally made nearly a billion ISK in two months doing high sec exploration. It can be hit or miss some nights, but those sites do exist in high sec and you can make a decent chunk of ISK just running through those in T1 exploration frigates. My experience has actually been the opposite regarding WH exploration -- I've found it to be almost entirely useless. The vast majority of relic/data sites in WHs are guarded by sleepers, and the ones that aren't are usually hiding a ganker in cloak waiting for you to start hacking a can. Low sec exploration is actually a much better, safer bet, and is more profitable than high sec. With low sec exploration, you can see who is in the system with you, so jump through low sec systems until you find one with no one in it, scan down some sites, hack some shit and run. Just be smart about it, make sure you are equipped with warp stabilizers and are using DSCAN to check for combat probes / ships getting close to you. 
---
Making money via PVE is also easy and possible in high sec. L1 and L2 combat sites (signatures, not anomalies) are usually pretty profitable and can be done in cruisers pretty easily. You can find L3 combat sites in high sec that can be done in battlecruisers or battleships. Your rewards will depend almost entirely on what kind of site you're doing, but to give you an example -- L1+ drone sites will have at least one drone commander (Sentient prefix) that have a pretty decent change to drop drone synaptic fluid, which sells for quite a bit. I usually get between 20-35m ISK worth of drone fluid from one of those guys. The other types of combat sites will have commanders for their respective factions, and those guys can also drop some pretty neat faction loot that sells for loads.
---
Incursions are also a great way to make money. They're done in battleships, but can be done by an Alpha account, and are available in high-sec. Every pocket that your fleet clears deposits ISK directly into your account. The ones I've been doing are in high sec and award 100m ISK per site, divided amongst 10 players, and take roughly 8-10 minutes to complete, giving me roughly 60-75m ISK per hour. If you are with an experienced team and FC, that number will get even higher. 
---
&gt; At least these icons were easy to identify. The new ones don't give much of an idea of what they represent, and multiple are similar leading to more confusion.
---
This is absolutely true. I'm not a fan of the new icons either. While they're less obtrusive and distracting several of them are also vague confusing or too similar to others. (Note that creating good icons is actually very hard and almost impossible when you're trying to make them for functions which are unique to a specific context like most of these are and which also have to cover some very similar but distinct functions.) Another old UI phrase is "a word is worth a thousand pictures"
---
He's literally making fun of you for thinking that. 
---
Woah, does it help automate input into Eve Online? Dang, that sounds really nice.
---
Pretty sure even if you don't feed them kills they'll still wardec everyone.
---
But that's how eve was for the decade before injectors, so your logic is that there were no new players since 2004.
---
Having supers doesn't make your supers invincible.  Having a fleet of supers doesn't mean you win everything.  Fleets of supers does not automatically mean other people aren't playing and having fun.
---
Sure, fleets of supers get used and almost ensure victory, just like it did almost a decade ago.  Guess what?  Major alliances with massive super fleets were beaten and lost their space back then.  If your problem with super fleets is you think they're invincible, explain the past, explain what was different, and explain how it could change to make the game better.
---
Injectors do not inherently break the game, get over it.
---
When you krab so much that NPC's help you outblob the blobbers. Early favorite for best Eve video of 2019.  
---
Oh hey, this thread again. 
---
No, get fucked. Death to all krabs.
---
Publicly shaming and friendly mocking is healthy. Demanding payment is not.
---
I did. But this is about CCP bottom line so nothing could be done at this point.      
---
There is somewhere post from CCP dev that injectors are staying and players need to accept the fact
---
I miss the elongated oblonging of planets.. 
---
I mean, I guess if you think attacking me personally makes my argument less valid, that's cool, but it doesn't.
---
I'm concerned for the health of the game and that is directly related to the accessibility of the game to new players.
---
So if wanting new players to be able to skill into ships quicker so they can participate at a more meaningful level (i.e., become targets) makes me entitled, then fine. I'll be that.
---
Finally, if you "can't fly anything bigger then a cruiser", maybe you should just chill out and learn a little more about the game before you try to get involved in decisions that affect the game some of us have invested a lot more time in the you.
---
Uh, yes we are?
---
TIL: logging in takes days.
---
Can't believe I just upvoted a Chevis comment, but credit where credit is due. He's right. 
---
Come around more often and then make your assessment again. It's difficult to pass judgement when you spend less than a few hours a year in our space.
---
Explain the player growth in the first decade of the game.  Injectors have existed for way less than half the game's life.
---
God the game looked so much better back then, the UI was actually readable. 
---
50cpu not gimp enough for ya?
---
How can an opinion be wrong? 
---
Hmm, mail looks retarded, but when reading twice and checking killmails I understand that someones mad at stupid players that were stupid (which is proven by the killmails). So its a bit harsh to just yell at the sender, if there is a rule of "do not jump into the knife" and someone still does, well what shoul I say ....
---
Glad that nobody would be so retarded to lose stuff to Hisec Wardecs that my CEO won't have to do such things. I guess we would not take money, we just would tell these guys "TOLD YA SO!!!"
---
Everyone take a step back. And imagine the entitlement in a nullbear when he argues only he should be able to afk safely in a nullsec system. Which is supposed to be lawless and dangerous. Just because he has sov and structures.
---
Remember that time when you lost your ratting and industrial ships during a war dec for a laugh? The loss was completely meaningless and you'll do it again.
---
But, if only your CEO had instituted a 100% loss tax, that'd make you think twice before doing it again. 
---
any perceived difference is an illusion on your part, dictated only by the means of the player him/herself.
---
CCP, however, would certainly appreciate the cash infusion.
---
Peoples who wants to rat/mine for example, it never let players have a chance to get money. 
---
I'd be cool with that. The day local crashed last month was amazing, had so much fun actually hunting and roaming without everyone being tethered before we got in system. 
---
And I still remember how bad I felt to have to wait 3+ months to be able to join fleets because I needed t2 larges guns and bs skills, and that was after playing for some time 
---
How can mirrors be real if our eyes aren't real
---
I've got a few guys in my corp that are weeks if not a month or two old out picking fights, making isk and pulling their own weight. In a wormhole Corp. One dude can't even fit covert cloak yet, the other skilled into an astero like last week, yet there they are, contributing and having fun while their wallet shoots up. The problem with current eve is entitled little children like the one you're relying to send CCP's habit of giving in to their tantrums. 
---
Probably my second favourite, however nothing can beat this is eve :)
---
I don't need to spend more time around. The killboard speaks for itself.
---
Some people hate caps this week. Next week... Who knows?
---
They are still kinda separated due to the swiss cheese geography of minmatar space, but i agree that Rens has been fairly dead. But as long as there are profits to be made people will keep stocking the markets.
---
A minor suggestion Jin.    Better advertising.   I didn't even know you were doing this  
---
How about you fuck off, I'm sick of this bullshit excuse that gets thrown out every time someone makes this point.
---
Making isk is easy, even the kind of isk you need to do this shit and 'Its too expensive' stopped being a valid excuse for anything years ago.
---
Let better teams in :D
---
&gt; You fit 7 beam lasers and 1 pulse, get 7 microwave S (one multifreq for the pulse) and snipe everything from 30km away. 
---
Oh, that's a worst fit ever! 
---
You should fit Cloak+7 Salvagers and T2 Salvage Tackle Rigs x 3. That's all you need and ROI and IPR (Isk-per-hour) is much, much higher.
---
*checks calendar*
---
Next week is Orthrus week, if I'm reading this right
---
That guy is 100% toxic. Loves to bring the exaxt counter to you ships i.e. Bring a solo hecate and brings an instalock inty with a legion or a cerb. S R members are so cool and they should not have to put up with this shit. Shout out to cirvadel! Ill get your damn dread one day.  Always get a good fight when femofaggot is not online. 
---
Love the idiot tax.
---
Old players who are butt hurt because people are catching up and now they are not cool anymore are the only people complaining about injectors.  And maybe a few poors. 
---
STFU SG 
---
Okay so now with the whole ship using r or 5 skills I'm now 15-25% less effective.
---
Seems like good game design.
---
Well I can't believe that I am going to agree with you.
---
If they make catch thier content zone they need to respect that if it is an openly stated purpose of the space.
---
But, being from Delve if you roam in our region you better expect to get dunked with no fair fights. Because we don't want you there.
---
I know this is an unpopular opinion, but I think injectors are beneficial in many ways that people don't think about or don't care about, especially for where the game is now.
---
1. I would not be nearly as involved as I am now in my corp, nor would I be having nearly as much fun with the game. Without skill injectors, instead of my 1 year mark in the game being having a carrier and a dread pilot, it would still be finishing up training some T2 frigate and destroyer paths, and maybe having 1 cruiser to 5. I wouldn't be in a place where I could be developing as a hunter and FC, because I'd still be a year or two off from half the ships I needed to do so in something bigger than cormorants or retributions. Instead of having to play a 5 year game of catchup, I can do it in 2, probably one if I was more dedicated to krabbing. Do you know how much *more* oppressive that carrier dropping on my 5 man gang would be if I knew it would take me another year and a half to train into the kinds of ships I need to beat that sort of BS?
---
2. **Skill injectors are not == to pay-to-cheat** The amount of pilots in this world that have been playing for *years* longer than I have and still don't have the moderately advanced or even basic things about flying a ship for themselves down is staggering. Just because someone can inject into a carrier/dread/super/titan doesn't mean they can use it, and people die in them all the time. Is it pretty easy to be in an N+1 titan blob? Sure. But even with the game as it is, you can't build a sov claim with titans alone, because you need to entosis, you need to have subcap control of grids so your titans and supers don't get picked off every time they're not in the middle of the blob. Skill injectors give you the toolbox to be good, but a screwdriver is never gonna be useful if you hold it upside down.
---
3. **multi-boxing has it's limits** Even if someone was able to inject lots and lots of alts into lots and lots of things, it doesn't mean that they can use them all at once. Particularly in a subcap fight, more than 2 accounts doing active things (logi, shooting, anchoring) is going to result in a deterioration of skill across whatever accounts you focus less on, and once you add in a few secondary characters, you're often capped out at 4 unless it's 10% tidi and you're flying dreads. Of course, skill injectors also make it easier for good pilots to take advantage of their ability to multibox as skill injectors are more effective spread across accounts, while they do little for the 80m SP guy.
---
Nah, don't feel bad, everything is better with lasers.
---
Thanks all!  Good advice and feedback!  I have no idea how to do perspective so this should help to clean this up.  
---
Doing it in highsec would be much harder. There isn't anything that you can anchor that creates a public beacon that you can use in Highsec (cyno/ESS is banned) AFAIK. You can find the pirate miners in systems where there is a forward operating base, I guess you would have to invite people to fleet and fleet warp them in, or anchor an expensive 'magpie' mtu or something for people to probe on grid with them. 
---
Yeah but level 4 missions, you don't need a huge investment to make decent isk if you're not trying to min/max everything.
---
I grinder my way up to buy an incursion character, which I then grinded until I could buy a carrier character.
---
That is how it was 4 or 5 years ago when I joined.
---
Cry more.
---
See, I can fly anything cruiser down pretty goddamn well, and I've invested quite a bit of time into what I can fly, so that argument is right out the window. But please tell me more about how inaccessible the game is to new players because they can't jump straight into whichever fotm ship they have no clue how to fit or fly. 
---
No. Use all beam or all pulse. Never both at once.
---
I dont know if they have been warned and dumbasses continue to take haulers through systems the deckers are in at some point you need to go enough stop being stupid or we will implement a stupid tax on you. 
---
I would argue that there are lots of carrier and dread pilots who are so bad they don't know what to do either, but it's definitely a bit harder to mess up a HAW dread vs. 5 subcaps than it is a battleship vs. 5 subcaps.
---
As the OP states, I'm the expert here
---
dude, that's fucking awesome. i could never draw something that good
---
The new abyssal space is pretty interesting and fun, it's a great little race against the clock for some decent rewards and with some actual chance to die.
---
The mutated mods, abyssal mods, are a gamble roll to get random stat changes to specific mods. Now, while you can get amazing rolls and create some stupid stuff, like 120k webs on rapiers and 60k webs on bhaalgorns and etc. Those mods are going to be expensive, from 300m all the way to 10b+. They are incredible when used correctly, but are far from cheap so not always accessible to everyone.
---
Options is dumbed down a bit, I usually play with the sound off unless I'm watching my wormholes wub wub. 
---
They upgraded to a new chat. This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move. It never works. Local is broken half the time (thank god) and glitches galore. Some days you don't get to chat at all.
---
As a wormholer btw, I still have a blast. Wormholes while sometimes sparce can still provide plenty of content opportunities. The great thing too is that you can come back as an alpha and still poke around eve to see if you want to play again full time. Note however you can't cloak or do much else in-depth, but it may reignite your flame. 
---
If you want to talk in game, join the chat gg_nrem and say hi to Sleeper Dreams!
---
You can use Harbingers for lv4s?
---
One of the corp I was in in Darkness did the same kind of trash. If you lost a carrier while ratting, they'd expect you to pay the full killmail value to the corp. Like yeah, when you lose a carrier, it's not already enough, your trash corp also wants you to pay the full value to it because it's supposed to serve a lesson instead of actually learning you want you did wrong and how to avoid doing it again. 
---
With a marauder, which can easily tank a carrier
---
I posted stuff on Reddit about it an CCP put up an announcement - That's about as much shouting from the rooftops as I wanted to do for my first time running a tournament, didn't want to fall flat on my face in front of a huge audience lol.

To add to this, I spent most of my time living out of Ichoriya. It's a medium sized hisec hub that's 1-2 jumps away from Black Rise lowsec. Easy to get stuff shipped there from Jita in large quantities, and you can reship and be back in low in just a few minutes
---
Man this is making me want to come back to Eve again
---
nothing is stopping you from ratting/mining while there is an afk player in your system
---
just because there are risks to your income source doesn't make it suddenly not an income source 
---
Malo is a good dude, he just suffers from retarded alliance mate itis
---
(source: we fight them most days and he is good but his alliance is sobad) 
---
So what's the risk right now of having a cloaked ship sitting in a system providing you with very valuable intel?
---
What's stopping them from ratting/mining?
---
I'm okay

What is that name feather masked censorship at 6:02 on red sabre on the overview?
---
Sov should be tied to a combination of things for a constellation.  All indexes should have a hard limit on contributing to sov.  Krabbing 24 hours a day would be useless.  Gotta mine and kill rats or clear sites etc.
---
Couple that with the holding alliance / corp's military presence.  If the sov holder can't hold military ground, and isn't utilizing a system's resources, it should become much more vulnerable to capture.
---
Of course, this would require a complete rework of many systems, and of the game itself being able to monitor fleets and kills on many levels.  Probably won't see anything on this level, but it would be a good start in my opinion.
---
its for those who ask to much questions!
---
100% reprocessing yield on modules is no more. You'll lose minerals by turning them into modules then reprocessing them later. The base reprocess rate on modules is 50% now, and while it can be upgraded a bit, i doubt it will be worth the effort now. These changes happened around 2014 I think, before i started playing, but this is what I've bern told

for someone who never played eve before its actually a very good gamplay and overview trailer
---
this is very much true 
---
because isboxer got banned.
---
That's how things wind up in Querious.
---
So what you're saying is that capital proliferation is the problem not capitals? I think you can remeber these exact same issues being discussed when ccp decided to introduce injectors. The more time passes the more it becomes harder to solve the problem.
---
For any future readers who are looking for Harbinger fits for this chain: 
---
I ran the 5th mission (where there are 3 neut towers, 2 web towers and 3 missile batteries), and didn't encounter any problems. I stayed at about 50-60km from the towers, taking care of the neut towers first, which went down quickly.
---
If you deal with the neuts first, capacitor shouldn't be a big issue. I never went below 60% cap or 95% armor. All towers seem to spawn additional drones when you attack them, but these can be taken care of quite easily. If you focus on the spawned drones before moving on to the next tower, you'll face no real problems, but you could even take down the 3 neut towers first before dispatching the drones they spawned.
---
Based on the feedback I got, I ended up using:

---
Considering the fact that Death Stars were bigger than Keepstars, had more firepower, more resilience ***AND*** could move via hyperdrives and sublight drives, all we need is for CCP to roll in a new type of citadel, "Siege Citadels". 
---
New meta, anyone?
---
How is the information shallow? All the information for all of the moving parts are either in game in module and ship show info's, or readily available with the most basic of google searches. Or did you expect me to hand hold and literally find tutorials on how to do the most basic of forethought?
---
Did you even read the part of my post talking about the reasons why your ol boy there didn't know how to do the most basic prepwork? It's habitual for him. You can see that in his killboard alone.
---
The learning curve is directly tied to the individual. I implied a super basic expectation of game knowledge for 'end game' content. You're implying that his ignorance is somehow anyone but his fault, or that there shouldn't be an expectation to get into that type of ship. I mean that's your prerogative if you wish, seems a bit entitled to stand there and proclaim some nebulous difference between could and should when we are literally talking about an asset that uses exact game mechanics as many other ships. The only exceptions being titan specific modules: Doomsday and Phenom gens. Which both have show info's on them.
---
Or someone could control test those either on sisi or in their home pocket under their super umbrella of protection ... unless there's a lack of prepwork or forethought. 
---
I mean real question to you; are you expecting some sort of video tutorial on how to not die in the myriad of ways you can blunder in a super or titan when you plug it in for build, or hop into it the first time?  
---
You say you stress your point clear, but it's not clear. Are you making excuses or are do you actually believe there should be warning labels?
---
I've always felt fighters should be ammo.  Once launched, you don't get them back.  In realistic terms it wouldn't make much sense, but it would go a long way to making using them a bit riskier.
---
But since everyone carrier rats anyway, I don't see this going over well.
---
Yes. As a mastermind criminal, I too, like to use a private(lol) forum in which to share plans.  
---
Yes, this type of communique has never been compromised. Well done, sir.
---
If AWU5 is a core skill, then I must be a magician for having survived 4 years without it.
---
As for in small-gang, piloting and know-how are a much more important factor than that tiny ROF difference. Which is why small-gang is so recommended - it encourages people to actually learn how to fly instead of just hitting "orbit at X - F1 - overheat hardeners" and hoping their ship is stronger
---
I'm not sure if I'd say injectors are a cheat but that definition doesn't exclude injectors. They aren't available to everyone, not everyone has the cash or isk to drop on injectors. And just because something is allowed by CCP doesn't make it not a cheat. For example there are cheats built in to games, clearly allowed by a developer. If in goldeneye for example one person had god mode and the other didn't it would be cheating whether the developer added it or not. Also if you played oddjob on slappers only and literally no one could hit you when you crouched. 
---
Do you people try to recruit on every post? 
---
Thanks for reposting this in more detail.
---
shhh brother.
---
Don't fall for panfam shitposters, they suck just as much as does their alliance. Lowscrubs like those can't even afford excavs and mine with T2 drones.
---
spod bless mittens
---
You've got some pretty great newbros from the sound of it! Take care of them, those types are all too rare these days (compared to the instant gratification type)
---
I mean fuck it, just install z-s overview by default. Then anyone else can change to a different overview if they like.
---
Is there any footage we can enjoy ? That would be delightful
---
If being a member of Imperium has taught me anything, it's that even the best alliance will have a large number of mouthbreathers and spodbrains who refuse to read anything or talk to anybody. Day-to-day discipline should be low-key, with occasional high-profile executions for the worst offenders.
---
i guess he's just punishing the idiots. if they leave upon this measure, whats he gonna lose? right. shocking amounts of idiots. 
---
he's a good dude. i say that as one of the rightful owners of the space he unrightful occupies.
---
but if you dock up they'll get bored and go away /s
---
Lol you still beating the dead horse of FAXes I see that I made an Impact on your lives you cannot let got. &lt;3
---
Videos of the tournament are linked in the post above 
---
I mean, if you have an explicit rule against doing X thing it's not unreasonable to expect repercussions when people completely ignore said explicit rule and does it anyway. 
---
Sure the rule in itself sounds pretty stupid but at that point you just leave the fucking corp, not break it and expect it to not apply to ya.
---
Let me remind everyone that INIT. has an unironic drama tax, so its not like retarded rules are uncommon enough to warrant such a reaction.
---
So, bridging 100 on a 20 ship camp won't be as cancerous.  Got it.
---
I'd price them the same as Titan DD's so 130 to 200m, just make DD's mountable to a sub cap class that can only hit capitals.
---
&gt; Shout out to Dan wingman
---
Makes me sad, cuz this guy only brings counters for me. Pretty much always a Deimos.
---
Occasionally anyway.
---
But injectors dont even compensate. So not much in that claim.
---
It takes a lot longer to form up 100 subs than it does 10 carriers. And they can be killed, like I said. Also, you can already do that shit. So really... I fail to see how it's any worse 
---
I what you say understand aswell as full agree well 
---
Imagine using supers and titans to kill...supers and titans! #bancaps
---
meh this is so mainstream, i dont feel no eve spirit. even the voice is kinda lame.
---
Yeah, with terrible awful stupid ugly names like Tragicprince001... and these characters had reputations.. and you could look at the year a character was born and quickly determine whether or not you want to take the fight. Today there are super pilots everywhere that are injected top to bottom, born 3 days ago. Lets face it, the Character Bazaar had its uses, but it is **NO WAY** compares to the exploitability of injectors. Burn a spy? Sell it for half price... Now, burn a spy? Extract it, delete it, inject a new one. 
---
Make only one character per player logged in permitted then you can camp or cyno or afk mine to your hearth's content.
---
Yeah, that's not how it works. At all.
---
They're not talking about getting out, they're talking about killing the cyno.
---
As it stands, there's no counter to a cyno bringing in caps anywhere.  Ship appears, cyno is lit, caps appear.
---
Ship appears, cyno is lit, ships lock, begin shooting, 10 seconds has passed, caps appear, ship dies.
---
You did it. 
---
You went full retard. 
---
Never go full retard. 
---
The problem with caps is their "Bring your own big cap fleet or just leave" nature. Aside from derpy players getting caught off guard without support by a subcap gang, there's no way to deal with them besides bringing your own or outnumbering them massively.  Combined with the fact there are no diminishing returns in effectiveness or increasing difficulty of just putting more caps on the field, this just means more is ALWAYS better. There's never a situation where you might want to bring something else to a fight with other capitals. Anyone that can get in one should, and anyone that isn't in one but could be is playing sub-optimally.  
---
Lol trusting snuff with anything in 2019. Hilarious drop though, would love a video with comms (from either side)
---
I remember when they didn't care how many bubbles you had down. So you'd go into someones dead end pocket and there'd be a 200km bubble blob on the gate.
---
lol jesus buddy how long have you been gone
---
trumps president and some tards on youtube are multimillionaires now and EVEs owned by a korean grindfest publisher just to get you up to speed 
---
Being logged in is suspicious.  Being active 23/7 is obvious.  Nobody is sat at a computer all day spamming Jita local.  And yes, its easy to work around.  But most of these accounts will be funnelling money to a main somewhere.  Stop banning the bots, ban the people RUNNING the bots.
---
I agree with you. Adding more exploration content with a variety of different encounters would do loads to make PvE more interesting.
---
You don‚Äôt bring in the faxes to start unless you need to. They clearly didn‚Äôt need to.
---
Because there is 0 chance CCP will do anything about injectors which is one of their biggest money makers. 
---
Adding spool timer in ratting/mining anoms only, or on caps only, would work.
---
CCP and communicating with community  that doesnt go togheter
---
&gt; With the latest wave of CCP Please Balance the game coming out... What do CCP have to say on the matter?
---
Nothing, I hope.
---
\&gt; Cyno frig to save your carrier/rorq in TYOOL 2019.
---
Because time or cost doesn't make a balance, it just makes the effects less visible. As you say, injectors allow you to switch to the next OP thing in the list.
---
Your balance of space is, in effect, a balance of capitals. It's a nerf of their biggest advantage, which is jumping.
---
The issue is they will do a dev blog eventually with changes which may impact your ticks (the horror)... imagine if they communicated what they were thinking or potentially planning on doing... so you could provide feedback before it was already tested and prepped to go live.
---
Or just get a hic. Unless the carrier has dual heavy neuts your are completely safe
---
You Mean is this really Eve ? With the salty People in it. I laughed so hard every time i see it
---
Yeah, next week is Orthrus. Waiting for that new patch allowing implants for warp scram range. 
---
You mean a Leshak?
---
im just glad we are out of NO RORQ NOVEMBER , that was such a retarded fad 
---
Dual rep smartbombing armor ragnarok 
---
&gt; Surprised they didn't show a vni orbiting a Haven as that's most of the gameplay lmbo
---
Only if that's what you choose to do.
---
EVEMon works, CCP's ESI doesn't always. 
---
At least not any more.
---
u wot m8
---
That is exactly the reason i left evictus.  But they wanted me to pay even more 
---
&gt; your ticks
---
Flair rocks, I don't rat.
---
Your post is one giant ball of contradiction.
---
Imo it's a good rule.
---
Like if his members are so dumb and keep feeding that might be the only reasonable way to fix it.
---
Capital proliferation and supers clearing hundreds of subs, dropping on anything that moved, has existed long before injectors did.
---
You're attributing a decade old problem to something that's only existed for three years.
---
That's some gud salt, mmmm.
---
Maybe invite more people üòâ
---
So wait, you think the fix for Capital and Supercapital proliferation in 2019 is going to be making the cyno ship easier to identify? Hokay buddeh, hokay. 
---
This, there's a big difference between publicly shaming/hazing people for being retards and demanding payment from them.
---
We would do what we have always done for the last decade - adapt, develop new strategy, sit back and watch little spergs like yourself post endless threads of tears on EVE-O forums, Kugu, Reddit, (input next iteration of shitposting here).
---
&gt; One could argue that it puts a dampener on a variety of content that eveolves around cap drops.
---
what variety? every single cap drop is fire and forget with infinite scalability, there is no variety because there is not much you can do with caps in the first place, they are too big to sig tank anything, they all effectively stand still so there's no speed tanking or transversal matching, so there is zero piloting needed. The only thing I guess you can do is the daunting hard task of managing heat.
---
Well, you're play the game, so who cares.  Obivously it's worked for you.
---
I'm talking about the numerous people who started playing, played for a week or whatever, and quit.  Retaining more of those players are what a actually matters.  Yeah, you'll never get all of them while retaining the vibe that makes Eve special, but without skill injectors, I think you lose you many of them.
---
I can't believe I have to say this, but the more people who play the game, the better the game is.  Saying "oh, I can do this, this and this, so fuck those other guys" is just self centered.
---
We lost since the Citadel Expansion 
---
You won't get a fair fight in Delve either, people still come and then cry after they died in Boson.
---
Legend
---
Suitonia, this is awesome work, and also a huge huge hint to CCP that the diamond rats are not being used to their full potential. The emergent gameplay, variable composition, realistic fitting and smart AI makes them a proper 'player' in the game world, rather than just passive targets for capsuleers.
---
Wormholes can be countered prior to any ship coming through them.  Wormhole =/= cyno.
---
Making fighters ammo but keeping their cost would somewhat counter a lot of fighter blob use.  You launch it, you don't get it back, and if you warp off grid, it's gone.  This would at the very least make someone think prior to launching their fighters if it is worth it.
---
Aye
---
Agreed
---
Yea it's retarded it can happen to anyone evictus did the same thing and they said if you don't pay we Will kick you and make your life misserble so in my eyes that's extortion and when i told them my opinion on it on discord they started shooting at me. Including that dickhead Francis raven Then i grabbed my stuff and left nullsec for good.  
---
The contrast between the light and dark really make it look cool!
---
I like that idea, since it pretty much kills the "what about the newbros" argument.
---
But yeah, shame it took the game getting fucked up for people to realize it was a terrible idea
---
&gt;If AWU5 is a core skill, then I must be a magician for having survived 4 years without it.
---
To be honest, you're not particularly smart for going four years without AWU 5.  It's a pretty fundamental skill that opens up a lot of fitting options.
---
What the fuck we're you training for four years that was more important than AWU 5?  So you had almost 80 million SP, but no AWU 5?
---
I'm inclined to think you suck at this game if you waited four years to train AWU 5.
---
Does not matter they don't live in high.
---
Let them wardec, Marmite and Pirat won't enter Null only to get their blinged out shinies dropped on by capitals.
---
Had some ramen so I might be over my daily content but damn if I dont enjoy salt.
---
I never left, I just don't do indy very often lol
---
Pretty sure they don‚Äôt call for it but I have definitely seen zkills of stuff in catch dying with caps on there
---
&gt;They upgraded to a new chat. This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move. It never works. Local is broken half the time (thank god) and glitches galore. Some days you don't get to chat at all.
---
This is a bit of an overstatement. Chat is rarely broken for all players, but if often gets de-sync'd for individuals (i.e. you'll be in system A, but still getting system B's local-chat). It still sucks to have unreliable local-intel available, but it's 'generally' working. 
---
Shhh
---
Call it what you will, our hugs are still the gayest
---
as long as i can update my reddit flair
---
While you can't see his fit, you can search his killboard to see what kind of ships he lost.
---
[https://zkillboard.com/kill/73093270/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/73093270/) this is a previous Confessor he used, I think it's reasonable to assume the fit he used against you is similar.
---
A few weeks ago on a different thread I said we would probably be needing this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmpOf02XHyA) sooner or later and I guess I was right. 
---
Fair play lads, see you on the next one.
---
7o
---
It would be a reasonable change if you were able to alpha through more than one fighters hp at once ? 
---
You hit a problem right on the head. But you hit the wrong one in the wrong way. 
---
CCP! Bomb launchers on cruisers, now!
---
Lol mad you attacked a "science" ship that was fit for pvp. Not well either haha.
---
The big fail is giving a shit about your killboard. If you do you have already failed EvE
---
&gt; No this should not be balanced at battleship size :D
---
yes it should, it should be balanced period and not when it's just conveninet for ya.
---
&gt; Also you have 20s to move out out of scram range and guy that is lighting a cyno cannot move at this point. 
---
good luck moving 9 km in 20s in a battleship when scrammed and even single webbed(you probably will be double), there's absolutely no reason not to fit one web in a cyno ship if said ship will be using a scram anyway. It really speaks volumes that your first response  is "just move out of the scram range" instead of "neut him off"
---
Anyone willing to live under that will be perfectly happy in the game preserve.
---
I'll never understand that logic. Live free or die.
---
This guy gets it.
---
I agree and would personally like that. But it's gone to far at this point. Game would actually die if that happens.
---
The Adam's-Apple is a dead giveaway...
---
Sov shouldn't be a monthly payment and bam, it's yours.
---
If you're not utilizing a system's resources, if you're not actively defending it, it should degrade to the point where anyone with a few destroyers could come in and claim it.
---
Of course, there'd have to be new systems put in place to monitor it, but it would definitely make it interesting to watch those unused pockets flip overnight to a small gang.
---
The big coalitions don't realize that if they weren't as big as they are, there'd be more balanced fights, more balanced fleets, more content.  They'll never get that and they'll never care.  To them, numbers means they're winning.
---
so you indy once every 6 years? 
---
this comment is getting added to my cringe compilation
---
Ah that makes me sad. He has always given me a good 1v1 :(
---
I mean, I've been in and out of EVE since 2010ish.  It's the proper way to play, otherwise my brain and wallet would turn to mush.  
---
I've been able to pilot a titan optimally for over a year, but I still can't afford one lel
---
It's so cool when players find ways to use new game mechanics to their advantage. I never feel smart enough to figure out something like this on my own.
---
hey asshole, you feel cool stealing my joke?
---
They've said balance passes and such have been coming pretty much at all times, only issue is they apply changes with a toothpick. 
---
He forgot ‚Äúwhatever.  already replace.‚Äù Like most do when they lose their toys. 
---
Yank him again, and tell him that one was was from thermodynamics, no dscan needed. 
---
Dude it's pretty simple. Fit your vni with a scram and max tank. Have your friends ready to undock. Bait the cloaky camper out with said vni. Dunk him and move on with your life. If they light a cyno and drop dudes on you. Oh no suddenly there's content. But I guess. I'll bears don't want that hua. 
---
I don‚Äôt think anyone should be able to afk safely once undocked including recon/intel scouts. If i‚Äôm flying a recon inty for a fleet I need to bounce pings constantly and crash gates, at any point I can be probed and killed shutting down my intelligence / target gathering. On the other hand I can sit a bunch of cov-op alts in systems and simply report intel to fleet, my argument is that to do the cov-ops/recon role you should have to actually play it - use your cloak and bounce safes and pings between limited tactical cloak cycles to avoid getting probed down. I simply think it‚Äôs a broken mechanic that you can permenantly cloak up in a safe and be immune to hostile actions - that‚Äôs from being a PvP player not a nullbears because a afk cloaked alt is zero content for either side - the current counter is dropping supers, if we want to nerf the umbrella and make small gang viable then make cloaked recon scouts an active playstyle that provides hunting opportunities for defenders rather than rely on response fleets, making it an actual challenge to fly intel recon rather than passive intel farming. The fact people want to keep it while nerfing everything else shows people (as usual) don‚Äôt really care about balance, they just want max easy kills. You are right, space should be lawless and dangerous which is why it should be dangerous to sit multiple characters in enemy space while afk - just the same as it should be for doing it in vni‚Äôs.

LR Fighters will still be strong af then

---
Don‚Äôt capital ships put you way above the 80 million sp range? I feel the penalty of only getting 30% of the total injector makes them pointless above 80 M SP. Those injection boosters of course nullified the penalty at least for a few weeks or so.
---

---
Nah - if a super gets bubbled by a dictor the super‚Äôs self destruct timer starts and only stops once out of bubbles. Rifters can fit doomsdays. 
---
Regarding the stats of diamond NPCs: honestly i never understood why regular NPCs have stats that are so wildly different from the ships they are "using". 
---
Why make a spawn in lvl4 mission consist of 10 battleships that are barely doing anything, when it could be spawn of two PROPER battleships (just not as smart as a player)
---
You talk like you type lmao
---
https://www.twitch.tv/evelog/clip/PolishedEasyGoshawkNinjaGrumpy
---
here's your answer 
---
If there's no cost and no risk to blobbing with fleet-ending ships any time something happens, it's no longer a game.  A game entitles both sides to have an equal opportunity for victory.
---
If I'm part of a coalition that spans 10 regions, and you're part of a coalition that spans 1 region, and I can drop 20 titans and 100 supers on you if I had to, and you can only field half those numbers (if that), there is no equal opportunity for victory if we are at odds.
---
There is a finite number of people, and a finite number of alliances, and a finite number of resources.  It's not a bad thing that coalitions are so big, but it has been and can be a game-breaking scenario.
---
If the larger coalitions truly want "balance", it needs to benefit everyone, not just the larger coalitions.
---
Oh no
---
You talk like you type lmao. fun vid
---
Just look at the skillu drop *yesterday* lol
---
However i'd argue that is kinda impossible to not know what to do in a dread, in a buffer one at least. You have 2 active modules, you just activate both and that's all there is to it lmao.
---
&gt; Filling in the template with random acronyms 
---
wait... i thought those where alliance tickers... FUCK 
---
I'd like to up it to 8 teams next time if I can find the teams and a structure that works
---
As long as it doesn't cause lag, you can still do this.
---
Yea, that's a full pvp fit, no analyzer, DDA, dual-prop, all tank rigs, part of a corp called "xXAGENTS of DEATHXx "... 
---
Guy needs to chill, wonder if his corp will make him learn d-scan.
---
Yeah, because I'm sure they'd get a bunch of lovely responses telling them how nice it is that they're communicating, as opposed to people just asking why they haven't "changed the numbers" yet.
---
I don't get how anyone puts up with this shit at all ever.  There are a fuck ton of corps and alliances to go to.  Fuck em
---
&gt;how'd you even find me
---
You're supposed to answer "one of your corpmates gave you away, don't remember who" for maximum entertainment.
---
[The only way to truly balance capitals is to...](https://youtu.be/MpmGXeAtWUw?t=90)
---
What can I say, I rarely ran into fitting issues, and the ones I encountered could be solved with a cheap implant, or a slight sacrifice (oh no, I had to fit a compact module!). Waste a month of training time on that? Or pony up a few mil once in a while, and train things that interested me instead?
---
&gt;What the fuck we're you training for four years that was more important than AWU 5?
---
Hulls, weapons, various other skills that caught my interest. Stuff that wasn't a marauder or dread requiring AWU5.
---
&gt;I'm inclined to think you suck at this game if you waited four years to train AWU 5.
---
I may "suck" in your eyes because I didn't take the MLG min/max-everything approach, but tbh I'm still here 5 years later, having had fun blowing up spaceships most of the time, and never having felt limited by that 2%. If that's considered "sucking", then it's feels pretty good to suck at EVE.
---
&gt; I don‚Äôt think anyone should be able to afk safely once undocked including recon/intel scouts. 
---
So you are saying locals of a space should be safer than offenders in that space. Because offenders have no structures to hide in. So you wanna give locals a further advantage. But the majority of the problems of Eve begin with how safe nullsec is for locals. Game balance demands nullsec to be made less safe. And AFK camping is one way to make it less safe.
---
So you want to make the game less balanced. Not more. You accuse people for wanting more kills. They can equally accuse you for wanting safer krab.
---
You keep saying things like "it's a broken mechanic" or "nobody should be able to afk safely" like these are principles written in stone that everyone should accept. Well guess what. AFK cloaking is currently good for the health of the game and the ecosystem. And it will be fine even after a possible umbrella nerf, because locals will still be able to outsmart offenders and use the umbrella. Until nullseccer pays 20% of his farm in kills and content (fyi currently around %4 in regions like Delve), anything that makes ratio possible will remain good for the health of the game.
---
Strategic Bombers? ü§î
---
You (and possibly whoever is responsible for POLICY in CCP - not the sec team per se) have the wrong perspective in this. You don't depend on player tickets and emails to find bots. You assign bots to hunt bots. Blizzard does it with warden. I bet you can google other big corps that have similar approaches to the issue. You just update your EULA, let the users know you'll be collecting data (not personal ones, just related to game) to counter bots running, set the hunter programs loose and see the automation work. Blizz even made money out of it by suing another firm (I think it got somewhere in the scale of 5mil USD). Then you use the user tickets and mails as a secondary feed, that you also run through automation, to direct your hunter bots. Problem won't be solved (there's always countermeasures and counter-countermeasures), but the point is making it so problematic to run bots, that it becomes cost-ineffective. If you take away the profits, the bot runners will cease to run their bots, or at least decrease in efficiency, game disruption and you end up with less flaming from players. Which would actually would be a win!
---
&gt; You use a Keres/damps to kill their lock range
---
&gt; lock range
---
better yet just use sensor strengh damps and once they finish locking you bounce on grid (assuming that happens before downtime ayyy)

Sure we will just ignore all the dev's and GM support the goons get. Why not.  It's not like I wasn't there when all the ground work was laid.
---
Skill injectors are a necessity to allow newer players a catch-up mechanic. I don't think it's healthy to have a game where prospective players need to pay a subscription for 3+ years to reach capital endgame. That's a huge ask which will put people off trying the game imo.
---
No other MMO demands such a huge investment, look at WoW a new player can typically grind to level cap and obtain a set of competitive gear in 3-4 months. Even with injectors it'll take the average player a long time to reach a position where they have dedicate rorq and capital alts etc.

Would be more fun if every titan were replaced with stack of gank fit racial destroyers equivalent to value of titan.

Battleship sized lance,  requires ammo 200m3 /shot.  Same restrictions as titan DD,  does 50k single target volley damage against capitals onry.

lol accurate
---
You don't compress minerals into modules, then refine at the other end, as module refining is capped at a maximum of 55% efficiency.
---
Ore compression, on the other hand, is entirely viable. 
---
100 Veldspar convert into 1 compressed veldspar.
---
that's 100 x 0.1= 10m3 of veldspar becoming 0.15 m3 (a single unit of compressed veldspar. 
---
Which refines to exactly the same as 100 units of veldspar. 
---
415 Tritanium, multiplied by whatever refining rate you get. Between 50 and 80ish %
---
at 50%, that's 207, at 0.01m3 each, or 2.07m3. 
---
The compressed ore is around 7% of the mineral volume (at a bad refine rate.)
---
At 70% refine, it's closer to a 20 to 1 compression.
---
Other ores compress at different rates. (always 100 units to 1 unit, but the volumes differ)
---
https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/compression/ may be of interest.
---
&gt; And just because something is allowed by CCP doesn't make it not a cheat. For example there are cheats built in to games, clearly allowed by a developer.
---
Thank you for saying this. Not many realize this.

Bright iPad backlight + sleep issues = no sleep
---
&gt;If there's no cost and no risk to blobbing with fleet-ending ships any time something happens, it's no longer a game. 
---
Ask Brave about how low risk those fleet ending ships are.  They are vulnerable to a well planned and executed trap just like anything else in game.
---
&gt;A game entitles both sides to have an equal opportunity for victory.
---
A game provides equal opportunity, but if one side uses that opportunity more effectively, therefore making the other sides chance of victory smaller, that's working as intended.
---
&gt; there is no equal opportunity for victory if we are at odds.
---
You squandered your equal opportunity in the preparation phase.  We all have access to the same resources, we all have access to diplomacy.  If you alienated your allies, or failed to make any to begin with, or failed to build a big enough fleet because mining sucks, you have no one to blame by yourself.
---
That doesn't mean you don't get to play, or you are stuck losing all the time, you just might have to reset somewhere else.
---
&gt;If the larger coalitions truly want "balance", it needs to benefit everyone, not just the larger coalitions
---
Ok, so when we rebalance everything in a way that benefits everyone again, and my coalition figures out how to optimize the new meta better than everyone else again, or more likely, everyone else can't be bothered to do some menial task (like mining) that arises from the new meta,  then what?  Do we just try again and again?  Do we just ban certain groups because they are too good at making Isk and diplomacy?
---
You tell me what you want.  I actually don't care. My play style has already changed too many times to count due to game changes, and I will continue to do so.
---
What does any of this have to do with jump gate fatigue, btw?

Tears.  The most overused saying on /r/eve .. It's like when Alanis Morissette uses the term Ironic in her song... no its not Ironic; that is not the meaning of ironic.

time to make him real sad
---
We played around with a paladin and caps on Sisi the other day. Part of it depends on your luck on where you are in the cycle when the cyno goes up. Dreads are more survivable than I expected, but if they have numbers, it doesn't matter, it's a race between dread lock time, fighter travel time, surviving a couple volleys and gliding out of bastion. A shorter bastion time would make marauders much more survivable against caps. 
---
It takes longer for some people to form up 100.
---
There are plenty of alliances and coalitions in game that could form up 100 at any time if they wanted.  And quite often, they're more than willing to drop them on a small gang.
---
I'm not saying that caps aren't a bigger problem, but cyno'ing in cancer is cyno'ing in cancer.  If there's no way to prevent it, you're still getting cancer.
---
It could be as simple as putting a hard limit on mass over time for the cyno, or a spool up / spawn in time in relation to ship mass.  But being able to blanket a small gang with five times their number, or with caps, should be able to be countered.
---
The problem was it was never countered when the problem began.  You had more and more alliances and coalitions dominating the field.
---
Players who wanted nullsec opportunity had a choice: be part of a large coalition, or get dropped on as opposed to decent fights.  That's not a game, or even a sport.  That would be as if you started a game of Risk halfway through and one person already controlled two continents.  It would be as if you started a sprinting match halfway through, and the guy in the lead can clear 30 feet per step.
---
Over time, more and more people have flocked to a smaller number of coalitions because that's the only way not to get blobbed (or they've gone to wormholes).
---
I got some bad news for you regarding Max-Moas March then...

K, so you have had fun, but that doesn't mean you understand the game well enough to know what's good or bad for the game, and you certainly don't know enough about efficient use of skill points to form a useful opinion about injectors.

I was sad when they said Titans were op...

I don't think Titans are op...

Why leave nullsec dude. Thats where the fun is. lemme know and i can point you to some corps. mine even does ratting carrier SRP :V

the risk is getting baited

I‚Äôve mentioned it before but it‚Äôs [part of] my experience of EVE.

I have a bunch of stories, not more important or ‚Äòbetter‚Äô than anyone else‚Äôs, but they‚Äôre my stories, my experience of EVE. Everybody has their stories, it‚Äôs that lived experience, the same but different, for every pilot you meet, that makes that place so amazing.

To meet someone who suddenly understands: OMG, we were in the same corp together!

To [take pictures](https://imgur.com/Jp13pmI), to talk to people... it‚Äôs awesome.

there are these things called prerequisites, these are the roadblocks, not a 5% bonus to falloff. Get a fresh toon and see how long it takes to unlock required stuff like T2 guns and armor, heaven forbid you'd like to fly T2 ships! 
---
It takes an entire week of focused training to just have the luxury of deploying 5 drones, one week may not sound like a lot but that's for the bare **bare** minumun for almost all ships in the game.
---
Let's not pretend this game is deep enough to justify all this downtime, a level 10 wow dungeon is more complex to run than 99% of fleets in eve. The myth that eve is hard is downright laughable at this point.
---
I'm even more blown away by these fucking alliances that still send fucking Eve mails like it's 2006 or something.
---
You missed the part where I proposed cutting the dps by the same proportion as ehp which means cap interaction between eachother would remain largely unchanged.

I hope you meant you left nullsec for wh space
---
Agreed. Hoping for this!
---
Make it so the azbels only drop the dreads and faxs, but the sotiyos only drop supers and titans.
---
gotta say, this is probably the best explanation of the game ever......and even if it looks simple, one ends the video with the sensation that this gameworld is just massive.
---
nah I know about sig tanking
---
Yeah and things have changed to the gaming landscape good or bad in the last 15 years that Eve has been out.
---
Right on.   Sounds like it went well!   :)
---
in that case there's no risk to the people living in the system. are you honestly saying that the ability for a scout to cloak is overpowered? 
---
The stupid tax is the loss of their haulers. Who doesn‚Äôt have an not hauler alt anyways??
---
or it could be from the Christmas accelerate for injectors that drove the price up. 
---
I kinda liked how it wasn't super tryhard. We just made 5 setups that looked fun 1 day before the stuff and went in.
---
 make marauders be able to take cov cyno bridges, make bastion mode also work like mobile cyno inhibitor (so no cynos within 100km of them while active. Drop a brick tanked vargur ontop of the carrier with a small gang and blap.
---
Congrats, I have now made marauders an order of magnitude more useful and have given a fantastic tool to people trying to gank pve carriers. I also think this change arguably makes marauders worth the isk (but I could see the argument that their price is yet still too high) thank you thank you hold your applause.
---
I actually had fun playing eve 2019.
---
Shame about CCP not having Thunderdome updated though.
---
you are not reading this correctly
---
Make marauders capable of taking cov cyno bridge and make bastion work like the mobile cyno inhibitor. 
---
Marauder is now the quintessential tool for ganking pve carriers and rorquals.
---
just quit and replace it with PoE, much more dopamine drip at a faster pace FeelsOkayMan

Imagine having to make a PR announcement every time r/eve goes reeeee over something. I swear to god we‚Äôre on a weekly bots/capital balance cycle of outrage...

Do the same in nano cruiser ...

Yeah, something like escalations for exploration, or more sites like the sleeper caches would be awesome. Even just randomly generated sites.

For 5 minutes, add it all up and you get an afternoons worth of work.

You're terrible at math.
---
"full pvp fit" :thonking:
---
I'm sure whoever you plan on killing with that "pvp fit" isn't going to warp away if you ask real nicely
---
How many carriers and supers do you have?
---
Who the fuck has 180 million worth of nanite paste. I don't even have that much in all my ships combined 
---
Let 5 ships use the cyno immediately, then a 30s pause until it has full capacity for more ships to use it. Then it will still work fine for micro gangs and haulers. 
---
Taking a hiatus right now but someday when I have more time to fleet up I'll be back. Until then I'll keep training into bigger ships
---
witch means the same intereaction between dreads bombs an cap fleets keep happining but now they have to worry even more about sub cap support and dds. As they will last even less time on grid and in turn put out even less dps on the traget there would off been sent to kill and die on. 
---
Imagine going through all this and still not using the right
---
you're\*
---
that guy certainly doesn't any more, that's for sure.
---
This video is AMAZING!
---
On the contrary, I know plenty about the game and mechanics. I merely chose to spend my time in-game doing things I find fun and learning about them, instead of sitting and waiting for an extra percentage point here or there before doing the shit I found interesting.
---
Of course you're going to think "OMG WE NEED INJECTORS" when your whole mindset is "I can't do shit without training my perfect month-long skills". 
---
Not that I expected more from someone sporting a Dreddit flair. 
---
The better question is how many times have I been killed by one.
---
instead of FOTM game meta we've evolved into FOTM reeeee
---
&gt;Regarding the stats of diamond NPCs: honestly i never understood why regular NPCs have stats that are so wildly different from the ships they are "using"
---
The idea was that as a capsuleer you fully unlock the potential of a ship making it have way better stats/capabilities.
---
You CAN, but it isn't remotely efficient.  An apoc will do the same thing way better for not much more money.
---
Do the 60 titans have 60 fax alts on standby too?   
---
It seems fairly reasonable to me that 1 group trying to use 180b isk to attack another group willing to risk 4.2+ trillion isk isnt able to achieve much.    
---
That's like trying to use a t2 fit t1 hull cruiser to attack a pair of battleships...   or close to using thoraxes to attack rattlesnakes.     And to push that analogy even further,   a fleet of 60 thoraxes attacking a fleet of 60 rattlesnakes, where each rattlesnake each has a osprey alt on standby...   
---
It's a lopsided attack from the get go.     
---
A single titan fit up reasonably is 20x as much as a single dread similarly fit.    
---
And all that is before you even start to consider that those 60 titans typically each have at least 1 faux alt jumping in as well,  and those faxes alone are worth what the dreads are.    
---
That‚Äôs a pve fit. You can tell because it has no scram/point.
---
&gt;Don‚Äôt capital ships put you way above the 80 million sp range?
---
'no'
---
it's actually not even close. super pilots don't even need that. 
---
To offset this, the Amarr pirates (sansha/blood raiders) have ewar that counters lasers pretty hard.  There isn't much more frustrating than being dumped in a mission with 5x tracking disruptors on elite cruisers that orbit at 50+k, that bring your optimal from 100km to 3km.
---
lol it only takes one. My children think eve names are funny. Progodlegend's name got some smirky eye-rolls. The 5-year-old asked why he had to be all 3 of those things. When I told them I was planning a new character, the kid said I should name it like PGL, except "NoobTurkeyPoop", more inline with my abilities.
---
I would say remove light fighters and have carriers and supers only able to use heavy and support fighters. This would remove the issue of them being oppressive to every ship type and goes in line with most space genres.  Albeit light carriers would have a reduced dps on their heavy fighters. 
---
Isk Per Rour?
---
That is not how math works.
---
You're terrible at existing.

Hey, as I said, nerfs aren't bad. What I see as bad is changes that affect everyone but only have in mind adjustments catered for a specific playerbase. 
---
And yes, you can bring up the point of "nullsec is the spotlight and bulk of the playerbase of eve so its obvious they want to invest in it". Fair point and very true. Doesn't change the fact that it's not fair to the others.
---
Let's not forget all the bugs in wormhole space that still linger.

A perfect titan pilot only needs 45 million SP.

It is viable against any other situation. Triglavian can be beat. You just have to get good. 
---
You're *sooooo* 1337.
---
No, not even close. Fully capable focused dedicated supper alt (as in: capable to fly one racial super really well and nothing else) is around 32-34mil sp for basic plan (so no link skills etc.) and with optimized skill plan taking full use out of all free remaps, takes around 16 months to get from scratch, no injectors at all.
---
Check out his killboard. Of course he's still spergy everytime he gets PvP'd. 
---
I was just about to post that. So sad.
---
I mean I would shit all over this because he's crying for it after they've run into capitals but have been super happy to drop caps on small fleets in their space all the time.
---
Perfectly stated.   It not the ships per se it the number of people who could be coming to the fight.    
---
Earlier you stated 2 guys in caps vs say 15 persons.  If not for caps those two guys would not try and fight.    
---
It will also force more people into the bigger groups to always ensure that enough people are on at any time to blob that 15 person gang.  
---
Watch out dude, this guy knows about sig tanking

I spoke about rorqual. But yeah if bot uses plex, peraps it was with some that you bought to ccp? :D

The current state of nullsec suggests that it pretty much is.
---

---
God tier at posting though.
---
&gt;On the contrary, I know plenty about the game and mechanics, including injectors and their effects. I
---
You keep saying that, but you haven't made a single coherent argument for why injectors are bad.
---
&gt;Of course you're going to think "OMG WE NEED INJECTORS" when your whole mindset is "I can't do shit without training my perfect month-long skills
---
I've never used a skill injector on my main characters.  I'm not sure where you get this from.
---
I'm just trying to help newbros get relevant in game faster.
---
if your question is, "this isk value is too high, right?"
---
the answer is no, if anything it's too low - if those capital bpos are 10/20 they are worth a shitload of money, and zkill values all bpcs at 0.01isk which a lot of those copies are probably worth a buck or two, particularly the concord capital mods
---
&gt; in that case there's no risk to the people living in the system.
---
cloak scout provides up to the second detailed intel on the movement in that system. You moving a gang in? just sit a cloak scout on their main form up citadel and you will know exactly what fleet comp is coming out to fight you. 
---
There is no risk needed to get that information.
---
He uses t1 missiles on his tengu lmao
---
Good lord he's doubling down on being an idiot
---
Nobody pves in an astero.

the skins are also all being shown as 0.1 isk each.

No one said it was a good fit.

Are we surprised by random cargo-ships getting popped?  Some people are stupid, and some people are space-rich enough to take massive risks.

Of course it can. It's not unbeatable or something that can be nerfed. However the tracking means that it is beat very hard by some things, and beats others simply by hull--piloting skill is often very little much a factor. There's not much avenue to turn the tables by flying well, since the main hallmark of the long range fight, transversal management, is gone.
---
Either you defang or burst down a trig ship, or it does so to you.
---
" a 2m isk mod that requires no sacrifice in fitting to drop unlimited numbers of capitals instantly. "
---
See this is the issue, you make it sound like that is the only prerequisite. What you are missing is you need to have pilots in capitals to jump, or pilots in subs on a bridge titan to jump. That isn't magic, that is teamwork, organisation and effort. 
---
It is a problem I see in so many suggestions on this subreddit, talk about nerfing a ship, module, mechanic, whatever, but they are fine, the simple reality is, if you are outnumbered, odds say you are liable to lose, changing any number of things in game will not allow you to compete against raw number and funding power, the only thing worth considering, is a way to force high number low area groups to have to spread out so density reduces, otherwise, any and all changes will be trivial at best, as the next meta will be found, and the bigger number groups with more isk will be able to use said meta more efficiently.
---
Is he? quick, someone tell him!
---
No.
---
Regarding the  **Perimeter Keepstar** \- Horde and NC. set out in Feroxes to defend a Perimeter market Azbel previously reinforced by TEST. That Azbel repaired successfully and uncontested. The Keepstar was a target of opportunity given the PanFam form-up was larger than TEST's. 
---
So easy to delete all the bot. Ccp can make a "black" shop with undercut price in cash. This will cut the profit of the bot. And i hope not so much people are using this kind of site so it wont kill so much their plex sales.
---
 If soneome use the shop. They can keep the money and ban the people for cheating.
---
i expected caps after 20 mins, not 5 lmao
---
Oh my word.
---
Well lets undock and see what wingy bits fall off the ship.
---
oooh you are saucy!
---
Probably "More Police SKINs available in the New Eden Store!"
---
Did you remember to keep capping up so you can extract after 5 minutes?
---
Have you been swapping ammo as you drift out of range because you bumped?
---
Are you managing your capital neut on a target that probably isn't the primary?
---
Did you siege red at the right time? EHE before you got alphaed by that titan DD?
---
It's all super simple shit if you're used to the checklist, but there are definitely things that a pilot needs to know when using a dread. These are the things that make a skillu drop with 65 dreads a clean extract, instead of losing 2-3 guys who get tackled during extract.
---
A lot of the decisions in a cap fight are aggregated to the FC when it comes to dreads, perhaps moreso than other kinds of fleets. But there's always more to EVE than you think there is.
---
Rorqual in highsec in the middle of video :S anyway quite nice trailer
---
It's a neverending source of mirth that players think any game developer is under any obligation to give players updates, or weigh-in on, their dumb ideas.
---
Thanks for the insight, I just saw it was a clusterfuck and the entire story was not there, just a bunch of dead ships and a certainly reinforced KS. That is good to know though. Thanks for sharing!
---
&gt; On January 26th, Northern Coalition and Pandemic Horde set out in Feroxes and proceeded to reinforce the Keepstar owned by TEST in the system of Perimeter in the Forge.
---
The keepstar was only targeted after a defensive timer for a market azbel went uncontested. TEST also lost 42bil in that fight, not 21
---
Spooling cynos would wreak havoc on trying to get capitals into an engagement. Every time you try to light, you get blapped.
---
The concept is there, but the execution is yikes

epic arc
---
Of course it can. It's not unbeatable or something that can be nerfed. I never said that and have never aimed at a pure nerf to these ships, because they occupy a good role and people are very passionate and attached to them.
---
However the tracking means that it is beat very hard by some things, and beats others simply by hull--piloting skill is often very little much a factor. There's not much avenue to turn the tables by flying well, since the main hallmark of the long range fight, transversal management, is gone. You don't need to be able to track an interceptor orbiting you at 10km in order to torch carriers at 50--that's just a crutch for bad pilots.
---
Either you defang or burst down a trig ship, or it does so to you. Fights determined entirely by what is on grid rather than how those ships are used is not super great.
---
As a proof of point--around a hundred comments on this thread, mostly vehement toxicity and passionate defense that they occupy a vital role--but nobody has forwarded a serious argument as to *why* trig ships need to track so well to fill that role or why the tracking should not be nerfed.
---
I don't think their current tracking is defensible or even necessary, and that is the entire point of the post. Evidently neither does anyone else.
---
Woof, meow.

OK. Thanks for updating me, the BR's on the system were not exactly behaving when we were initially looking to show that kind of number, but I will make that change now to incorporate the more accurate numbers.

im not completely sure about this but i feel like venal isint the place for the epic arc. besides that there are so many ships that would do that job better for cheaper. not buying it.

Use ship with tank?    Like 200k EHP maller? Light cyno at range so capitals rewarp?
---
It certainly turned INTO a clusterfuck of TiDi! 
---

That's why you need that tax. Because otherwise he'll just use this ISK to buy another hauler. And yes, this actually happened.
---
My beloved Lord don't like if someone fuck with his property. 
---
TAPI only exists because Goons allow them to exist. Change my mind.
---
Surely this applies to basically any alliance in eve?
---
So what? if he's hurting your precious kb just kick the guy..
---
Contrary to what he's saying, there are tons of MMO devs who don't give a shit about emulation unless their hand is forced by the project directly competing with them or trying to make money off their work.  "Tyrannical" stances are definitely the minority in my experience.
---
On the other hand, directly assisting emulators is almost unheard of anymore.  UO and a couple other games actively assisted emulator projects in the early days, but they almost inevitably led to drama and bullshit.  I think developers wizened up in general, it's way less trouble to just turn a blind eye to well-behaved emulators and let them work on their own.
---
I would imagine one simple reason Eve's emulators aren't worked on more is that the game hinges on its giant single server, and all the snowballing interactions within it.  If you only have a couple dozen people in the entire galaxy, you'd have to scale down dramatically and change a lot of things to make it work, and that might wind up spoiling the experience for a lot of people.

&gt; Rorquals still die even with the outrageous local tank don't they? Now lets call Bombers Bar to verify this statement!

BREAKING: Ships can be killed. No balance needed!

get this man a medal

an actual balance strategy that sounds fun!

Personally I think they nailed this one. One of the few trailers which show real gameplay footage, upgraded just with a excellent camera movement.
---
so exciting it needed two threads
---
Why haven;t they changed the numbers tho? seems like a legit question

---
&gt; It's all super simple shit if you're used to the checklist, but there are definitely things that a pilot needs to know when using a dread.
---
I can say this about literally every ship and it would be true to an extent, but for buffer dreads its really worse than every other class without even comparisson. 
---
Like all you mentioned is super simple simple stuff that you should hope someone who trained all the way to a dread should know, and apart from the EHE and siege they aren't capital specific stuff as well so ther's hardly an excuse. If you aren't able to use a simple neut or press siege twice in a 5 minute window there's not much to say, you are just making stuff sound far more complex than it is.
---
It would seem them.

I just want to take the time and spot below Chevis‚Äôs post here for a PSA that Chevis hasn‚Äôt been incredibly active in EVE because he‚Äôs busy l33t420n0sc0ping nubs MLG pro style in... Runescape.
---
Source: his post history, point and laugh guys.
---
I really don't understand negative comments here.
---
This is eve, if you pvp at home, you're doing it wrong. The only right way to have a secure home is to declare it NO CONTENT ZONE. You either blob up or dock up. You don't give gudfites. You kick everyone who isn't able to dock up and feeds kills.
---
If you don't do that, you'll get those "looking for free kills, preferably not a fight" types (just like that stupid Nedtot here) flying through your space 23/7 in search of free kills on pve ships, and running from every pvp attempt crying about "counters". Unless you utterly and completely deny them any of that "content", you just can't play eve. And when you shit on them in local for being too afraid to pvp, they go reddit and cry here...
---
And stupid tax is not wrong. If people were dumb enough to not have a neutral alt, they are dumb enough to just buy another hauler and "try" (oh god I hate those "trying" types) again, which makes it better to just take that ISK before they use it to hurt themselves, or kick them to make them someone else's headache.
---
So why does everyone react like something wrong is happening here?
---
Inner Hell landed initial tackle on a rorqual - not skill urself 
---
I think it's more about trying to dissuade stupid behavior. We only see these evemails not any he sent before and as I'm at work and more so dont truly care the killboard may have a bunch more that they talked about either in other evemails or on comms.
---
did i just see a rorqual in a 0.5 system at 3 mins 46 seconds
---
okay, so the diamond NPCs are actually NPC capsuleers? i guess that makes sense.
---
it's just that stats differ WAY too much. if the discrepancy wasn't THAT big, i wouldn't think about it. like if rat ship was as effective as "base skills to pilot the ship" capsuleer ship - that would be fine both lore-wise and balance-wise. but rats are MUCH weaker. 
---
look at [this dude](http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id=16980) . it looks like it's a caracal. HP is lower than unfit no-skill Caracal, and the DPS is half of the T1 HML + T1 Scourges (on base skills). 27 dps from a cruiser... it's just... i dunno...
---
maybe i give that too much attention...
---
It's a neverending source of mirth that companies think any game player is under any obligation to pay subscription for a game, when game designers don't invest in the product.
---
and everyone who has a brain that can process how stupid the idea is tbh.

trying to click your link but it is not working for me. just loads up blank for me.
---
as soon as their leadership uttered the words "casino war" it was doggy treats from there on out
---
Because your problems with the numbers are not the only problems they have to consider - Just nuking the abillity of caps to apply to subs means Carrier/Supercarrier ratting dies immediately, and then CCP has to deal with the backlash over that as well.

not true, i could take on goons solo

The original comment was that removing 100% safety from cloaky scouting would "remove risk" but the question was "what risk is there in sitting around cloaked?" 
---
I thought that people got up in arms about things in this game being 100% risk free. Or is that only when such a mechanic doesn't benefit you?
---
I wouldn't say get rid of the NSA, instead increase the lock time by 50%. It would still retain its functionality, it would give subcaps a larger window of escape, and it would have a tertiary effect of slowing the pace for ratting, which I know a lot of you non-Delve residents would love to see impact our MER.  
---
(Just gonna say it, that last item would especially impact the smaller legit players and corps/alliances out there, but would likely have a larger negative impact of creating more bot use to counter the loss of income from bounties, for those people that can't play a game without cheating.)
---
Brisc was telling me how Titans are about to get an active rep bonus. Jokes on you
---
found shaggy's reddit account
---
Drives me absolutely up the wall too. The corp I run is new player focused as well, but we've got a clear plan for rookies, skillplans tying into that, an illustrated corp  wiki that explains everything from in depth faction warfare mechanics, to  SP optimization, and to how to never have your hauling alt show up on zkillboard. We take rookie training seriously.  
---
Meanwhile, Winmatar is recruiting new players,  and then just absolutely abandons them. I poached a new guy from Biohazard a while back, he was asking in  militia whether there were any 'ISK making fleets up'. I asked him 'why do you need a fleet to make ISK, you could just run plexes, exchange some LP'. He was completely unfamiliar with the concept, so I explained things to him  in private convo, and  he told me "well, you've just taught me more about faction warfare in these last 30 minutes than biohazard has in the last week". So I offered him to join us instead. 
---
Wow. Was this a gank or a war dec?
---
&gt; That includes all weapon system skills to 3.
---
And we all know how incredibly NOT strong that is.
---
&gt; Yes, you can specialize in one ship and be even better in that same amount of time.
---
It will take years to complete all skills relevant for any fitting. And you either do that or lose to the ones who did. SP is the strongest force multiplier, after all.
---
&gt; You may not win one-on-one, but can contribute to a small or large fleet, i.e. be useful
---
Yeah and be safely ignored because no application skills make you hit for 22 damage. 
---
&gt; If you have 50m-70m SP, you are not piloting the vast majority of ships you have trained for.
---
50mil is like what, 2 ships to max? I guess you aren't flying one of them, but it's still not just vast, but not even a majority.
---
Not nuking it is one thing. Not touching it at all is another. 
---
Only problem is it starts off pretty boring. No one is going to watch the whole thing unless they‚Äôre already interested in Eve.

Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system.

quit stalking him outside of /r/eve you weirdo
---
The problem isn't the cyno module. 
---
The problem is the jump drive, and how it reliably plops the ship 5,000m from the cyno with two clicks of the mouse. 
---
LOL at all the local gankers rushing to whore on the killmails
---
&gt;warping a dreadbomb down into a fight
---
You‚Äôve got to be kidding me, surely you see how dumb that sounds.
---
Any subcap trying to like cynical in range of a 100 man fleet is going to eat shit, and if it stops moving it can be killed by a cap gun dread instantly, never mind perfect application from fighters and all subcap weapons.
---
the hype was real when "this is eve" hit.. that here is a good video, but nothing like old times..
---
I mean it doesn't even sound like there was a breach of trust there, just nerds thinking that the ships who can teleport thru systems won't jump into a move op cause they planned to attend a nearby fight
---
Dont even need subcap support.

It wasn't even close to 2:1 numbers. Both sides jumped in with even numbers at the start and the goon side only started to pull ahead when US tz started logging on and test got finally got there with some help from NC beginning to dock up and log off.

God I don‚Äôt, remember that ruddy falcon stage. You would head into what looked like a great small gang scrap, then the inevitable falcons would de cloak. Teams peak would be filled with your fleet members swearing and you would all bugger off to find someone else to fight....
---
you don't have to solve all problems perfectly at once, and ccp is way too far on the opposite side of the spectrum to argue that changes need to take longer and be more thought out. We're not talking about nerds asking for ships to be perfect within the first rebalance, we're asking for there to be a fucking rebalance in the first place before the heat death of the universe and a follow up on said rebalance before another universe is formed.
---
It took them the better part of a decade to fix warp core stabs in FW plexes, and they still managed to add side affects when doing so.

It's a pretty good trailer to be honest.

Covert ops are literally designed to be cloaky scouts which probe and watch things and gather intel. You‚Äôre asking for risk to be added for the gathering of in system intel when there is a real time character list of people logged into system provided to every player, including players who are docked and thus completely invulnerable. Eve is not a game where in system intel is hard to obtain, and unless other aspects of gathering in system intel are changed, it would make little sense to not let scouts cloak. 
---
This was totally within the realm of not-weird don‚Äôt try and create this narrative.
---
what in the fuck...
---
If you cannot handle a slow start, Eve isn't for you anyways.
---
Caps are so broken. You should keep killing them to get rid of them

Do RnD agents still do anything? Years ago they used to be a great source of passive ISK, but while doing some skill extractions I found a bunch of SP sitting in Science skills for that reason.

2. How can I check my balance with the RnD agents? Can I do it remotely?

---
All nullsec alliances lose more than they kill. Those who care put all their pve alts in another alliance and pretend to be unrelated. The rest do not. At the point where I personally stand, killboard clutter with the random deaths all over new eden is less solid intel than one concentrated in a certain area, so yeah, if you wanna go and lose your ship in the middle of provi, go do it, just dont die dumb.
---
Thus this is not about killboard, this is about stupid. Gaining any sort of attention in eve is stupid, losing bling to hisec ganktards attracts more hisec ganktards and other tards. The stupid tax is aiming to reduce the amount of asking for problems.
---
My bad, yea, cap rechargers instead of web/point, why use a Astero for PVE, wouldn't a assault frig do better?
---
What about newbros who want to fly caps like everyone else already is?
---
It depends on the site tier I assume. In a perfect situation you should be able to fly to the primary and secondary chests and finish killing just before the gate that way you have a perfect balance between ships maneuverability and speed with dps and tank. Then its a trade off between how fast your ship can move and get to the chests while having enough tank and dps to kill the enemies. 
---
Remember, a mechanic is only broken if you're losing to it, otherwise it's

only reason i play this game is for my killboard

A blinged sacrilege can do that for you. It's not always a straight line to the cans but usually I'd turn on the ab, burn straight for the cans, kill tackle and then chase down whatever is running away. There are instances where that doesn't work great but that's a general idea

It was my first experience in low-sec AND eve entirely lol. Luckily I was in WOTA and not BIO, WOTA had the same problem of mass recruiting but they at least tried to teach people (but some people cant be taught of course, hence the plex hauler, which I witnessed while in discord with Hopper.) Only reason I'm still playing EVE is because Jamer Roskov was a genuinely good FC and CEO and helped be out quite a bit. I've Just rejoined FW two days ago after a two month break and am loving the solo experience so far. May join another corp but I really don't like the BS and drama that usually comes with one. Till then I'm flying solo, see you in the WZ :)

I know right? Their recruiting tactics and subsequent treatment of recruits is frankly unethical. 
---
They also always spam militia chat for "WINMATAR &lt;Something&gt; FLEET", then appearently bitch at you for 2 hours to get into their corp  talwar doctrine, completely ignoring that these are Amarr pilots joining their fleets. At least that's what I heard from people actually joining those fleets. 
---
Then they bitch that they can't make enough ISK or get any fights, because they have 15 talwars running the same damn large. 
---
I've got a [chatlog](https://pastebin.com/ntCnAyRZ) with one Winmatar guy who got really defensive after he realized we were in cahoots with the corp that 'wardecced' them,  and he was complaining about how  they 'needed' to  run missions to be able to afford to  fly the ships the wanted,  despite appearently 'dplexing' all day.  For reference, a full day of dplexing can do 20% solo, and if the system  is as highly contested as that, and with Amarr miltiia in  tier 2 as it was at the time (because our corp kept upgrading it), 120m is  kinda low.  
---
Anyways, I can rant on Winmatar for days. 
---
You got bamboozled!
---
Your point remains irrelevant, but you're a hapless linemember of some blob regardless.
---
I'm not saying don't let scouts cloak. I'm just saying don't make it literally actually impossible to dislodge them when they are 99% afk. Presently there isn't any counter play to it, no risk to them for it. 
---
Once again i ask. 
---
&gt;I thought that people got up in arms about things in this game being 100% risk free. Or is that only when such a mechanic doesn't benefit you?

---
Based on a true story. They ran out during the hadozeko bash, and had to ask us whether we had any spare antimatter. Despite flying laser ships, we actually did, and I started making it a habit to bring spare lenses, hybrid charges, and projectile ammo, as well as secure containers to future hub bashes.

Yeah Jamer Roskov was the only person to put fleets up for Winmatar. Aslon just said "make a mini alt, join our mini corp and mission run". I was technically a "FC" in Winmatar despite being a newer player. To be fair Jamer said I was rather good for a new player and I Fc'ed a few of our plexing fleets when we got in fights for practice. Anyway, because i was a FC I got to see the FC channels in discord. Which I'm sure you can imagine had some pretty "Special" conversations in them. Tons of drama which drove away Jamer, and other, pilots I actually enjoyed flying with so I left as well.w
---
caps are broken if you die to one, if you kill them they're just awful pilots
---
I think that would be appropriate.  Both sprung from online forums, and Goons took TEST under their wing at a young age when TEST was learning to walk on it's own, before the crippling autism diagnosis.
---
Noice! I'm going to experiment with that ship tonight. I'm a little resistant to the Gila, I don't really like drones and I know its an amazing ship. But because everyone else is using it I want to have something different which could be a massive benefit in any final gates. I actually noticed that I can make a Muninn fit for way more DPS than the Huginn and just as much speed. I could run Gamma sites with 95% EM armor resistance. The fit I put together quickly had a lot of CPU and Power remaining so I feel I can push it more I just need to get creative. Can't wait for tonight to mess around, I'm busy for the rest of the day so will have to wait until tonight. 
---
It's a really nice trick... I was on Brave Comms when you pulled that truck in Catch... We had it figured out pretty quick, and the conscious was that you are an evil genius, and genius is to be commended! Good job!
---
You can indeed. It might be on the upper end of skill requirements, but any battlecruiser can tank a Lvl 4, with the proper setup.
---
Killing might be a slightly slower process, though.
---
Yep Aslon didn't encourage solo plexing because the newbros kept dying and that "make the killboards look bad." However at the sometime he almost never FC'ed plexing fleets. Jamer was 99% of the fleets that ran, Jamer was pretty much the only good thing Winmatar had going for them and he got drove off by drama and other bs.
---
CCP problem is of its own making.  Make Capitals completely OP so people only really need to use them... Then try to nerf them.  I would have preferred the Vedmak strategy with something so dominate.  Make it underwhelming and then buff it in rapid iterations (rapid something they also have not done).
---
Who would have thought though... get a small group of people that love flying capitals into a focus group.  Then they come up with a game mechanics / suggestions that are fantastic for their type of gameplay.  
---
Oh, provi is suckling the Korean dick hardcore.  They absolutely love errest

Ham launchers with double faction web and a t2 application rig will work wonders.. dual rep, large cap battery and afterburner with a single eanm or reactive hardener and double BCS. For second rig would recommend the RoF missile rig, loading bay or something like that

Point I am making is it‚Äôs actually not readily available .. there‚Äôs a disconnect between assertions and tacit knowledge transfer. You‚Äôre preoccupied with your solution which may or may not be the answer ( as fuck knows eve becomes very subjective) .
---
The answers are based on word of mouth / peer assumptions on the day or post kill mail which loops back to my original statement school of hard knocks ... 
---
Why because it might pose a challenge? 
---
Ahh  Vizaresh is a good guy to be honest, one of the few in Winmatar. However we really bought in that we were the "good guys" so to speak. There really was a sentiment of "everyone is against us even out own milita" narrative being spun by the Leadership there.

pass.. Would be good to know what CCP thinks though.

Lore wise, no. They are crewed and captained by a bunch of NPC peps. That's why they are so ineffective. Instead of just one dude with the entire ship plugged into his brain, it's a captain telling a bridge officer to tell the fire control officer to tell the gunners what and when to shoot.

It's a neverending source of mirth that cryhards use hyperbole to conflate facts to fit their narrative.  "The devs haven't done exactly what I want right away so they must not be doing anything" is the tear-soaked sandwich our ships run on.
---
Oh, I feel sick 
---
Fck you can't even role play in this game without some faggot killing you while you flying in science ship..... 
---
Some capitals dies, we were all wrong. Everyone go home.
---
A rorq that engages panic will also shield mining and industrial ships within range (umbrella effect)
---
The rorq panic effect applys to on grid mining ships if they in fleet
---
They cannot, you cannot fit a cloak without omega and all the covops ships require omega too.
---
It keeps the choobs out. Mostly.
---
Yeah, having a farming corp in enemy militia is a huge no-no in traditionalist Amarr circles. From what I heard Amarrian Vengeance used to evict entire corps from Amarr militia for that offense. 
---
That said, as far as I know, the entire reason why Winmatar is part of Amarr militia is that they pissed off all their allies in Minmil, then got chain evicted from several systems by Aveng, and then they made a deal with another Amarr corp  to  get their Amarr standings up  and join Amarr militia, just so that Aveng couldn't continue hounding them. Of course that was far before my time in EvE, so I can't attest to the veracity of this.  But given winmatars attitude and competence, and how relentless the few remaining Aveng pilots  are,  I  am inclined to believe their version of the story. 
---
AH, that explains it! What is the radius of this effect?
---
But it doesn't apply to their mining excavators?
---
I guess I shouldn't show you the rest of my hanger... You wouldn't believe the things folks just leave in their wrecks

I dunno, my favorite is still the [Inferno video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kED11aGobUk), though it was the [Butterfly Effect video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08hmqyejCYU) that first hooked me into the game. 
---
I meant "I'll probably try an Apoc when I get to level 4 missions", but I've got the sp for both. Not really got the skill to fly either with a PvP fit (in game or IRL) yet tho
---
And thats only with 2% of his power
---
1. It's as worth doing as any other minimal payout passive ISK activity.
---
2. Alt+J brings up a window that can show you missions you've been offered or accepted, loyalty points you have and I think the research window is in there too. 
---
3. The science skills are used to do research on blueprints and to produce T2 ships.
---
I think you're already doing what a lot of people do to afford Plex
---
Logo bro is best bro
---
Clonebay and not the armor reps on a rag? lol
---
Correct
---
That's very similar to the story I was told by Aslon and Riot, of course it heavily watered down and painted us as the "good guys."
---
Its stupid because this is not a random industrial it is a deep spact transport. DSTs have a fleet hangar that fits 50k+ m3 and is only affected by skills, not by expanded cargoholds. He could have used every one of those low slots for tank and warp stabs and had effectivly the same amount of cargo at much less risk.

I dont think you can really rorq mine in lowsec or npc null. No sufficient cap umbrella?
---
To do good at pvp, you have to win fights before they start. Manual piloting is also required, but if you go into a fight on your enemy‚Äôs terms, you‚Äôll almost always lose. 
---
I‚Äôve had a lot of fun flying a triple ancillary rep jaguar, it‚Äôs a lot tankier than anyone expects, so I can sometimes get people to attack me and then just hold them for a couple minutes while backup arrives. But even then, I have to make sure backup is nearby, that their ship either won‚Äôt apply well against me or has low dps, and that they don‚Äôt also have backup. Pretty much every time I engage without doing that things end poorly. 
---
If you‚Äôre trying to go solo, or have a less tanky ship, you have to be even more careful. Just yolo‚Äôing into every enemy you see is practically guaranteed to end poorly. 
---
I could give you more advice if you told me what exactly you are trying to do, but pvp is too broad for me to get any more specific than this

relevant flair ?

Unlike the market or corporation icons in OP's screenshot? I don't get it. If the default location didn't give it away, most players wouldn't be able to spot the correct icon to open the market.
---
The corporation icon is five stars on a fucking planet with a ring. Not much different from now. All the other icons in the screenshot are easily comparable to the new icons. More than half of them are basically the same.

Test had a citadel to kill, didn't kill it and fed hard to try and win the objective over the isk war. Objective was lost and isk war aswell.

right, but when you have 50+ battleships in your fleet, it becomes very meaningful.

This is amazing. Also I never realised good standing made them friendly.

What is a "Nano Gang"?

Marcos are not "hotkeys". A hotkey is a key you can press that performs a SINGLE function. A macros is a SERIES of functions which is why they are banned.
---
" So if I were to use PowerGrid (for example) and set it up so that one button press launches drones, another broadcasts for shields, " You are describing creating your own hotkeys which isn't explicitly listed as against the rules so I wouldn't think this would be an issue, but with CCP devs who knows?

To be fair I usually loot between 10-30m of nanite every roam (given not feeding) so most of my ships have a 2k stack for no reason

Good stuff but add some pauses/punctuation to your speech haha.

---
Wardec corps don‚Äôt care, they eat deck either way. Corps like this will die if they keep this mentality
---
I'll admit at this point that AMSCP has a terrible killboard. We encourage people to whelp ships into fights to cut their teeth in. It makes for better pilots that you can count on in a fight. 
---
I also view ships lost of the cause as a mark of pride, not one of shame. 
---
And I think  there is nothing more enjoyable than a suicidal gamble working out. For instance, during the defense of Avenod, I decided to whelp a kiting beam coercer into a small with 4 enemy frigates inside, and a gang of cruisers on the gate. I got in, was able to get distance between me and the frigates, and evicted them from the plex, then evicting them again as they came back after repping up. That bought us 2 minutes. I did die the second time I attempted that stunt, but it was worth it, even  took one of their griffins down  with me. I also died when I tried sniping one of their bombers off the ihub.  
---
Sadly they got the hub on their second attempt, with us about a minute away from closing the plex  that would have taken the system out of vulnerable.  But we made them bleed for it. 
---
I got my drones back tho
---
its not a b4r? its just a wholesome post

Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
I'm aware of two definitions, which can be differentiated via context.
---
1. A very small fleet of ships.  Smaller than a "small" fleet.
---
2. A fleet of ships that have been fit to maximize their agility, so that they are better able to choose their engagements.
---
I think we only lost the iskwar because the enemy wasted time shooting Logi, otherwise we did really well...

No, they expose already-existing issues faster.  The issue was not created by the injectors.

I actually asked Aslon in militia chat to tell me his side of what happened, but yeah, definitely more of a "us against the world" instead of "we messed up" vibe to  it. Very "No, you didn't break up with us, we broke up with you". 
---
I mean tbh, with all the other stuff going on I don't think we'd mind Winmatars stuff as much  if they didn't also have the compulsion to paint themselves as the MVP of Amarr Militia. I mean that's just stolen valor,  isn't it?

Player considering returning. I have a ~50mm sp character. If I start playing using an alpha clone, do I have access to all of my skills, or are they ‚Äúturned off‚Äù until I activate an omega clone?

I say that they are  just effect of the injectors and they are here. Like you have ships ... and what is also important pilots.       
---
You cannot go away from this - those people injected a lot of cash to CCP wallets - and nerf that is required will make many customers unhappy and many of them will become ex customers.              
---
CCP is a company and it cannot allow itself on this.      
---
But at the same time without huge changes to capitals CCP can make space more different - like areas of game when you cannot use capitals could solve a lot of issue.          
---
There are min-maxers out there who will micro-manage their fit for every single situation, will rage-quit after every loss - no matter how insignificant - and who will probably bring up that one time they ganked you whenever they have the chance, even years later. Those guys are dicks.
---
There are F1 drones who fly what their FCs tell them to fly, but who don't align, don't jump on command and never, ever shoot the primary. Those guys are dicks.
---
There are glass cannon yolo monkeys who strap arties onto their shield fit Thorax "cos it saves cap", who will inevitably lose ninety-nine out of every hundred fights. The 100th will be a blue-on-blue kill because they locked the wrong target in their excitement. Those guys are dicks.
---
And then there are people who will genuinely help you out. Take you under their wing, teach you how to fit your ship, and how to skill efficiently. Give you a home and let you learn how to EVE organically, at your own pace. Those guys will inevitably steal all your corp assets. Because they're dicks.

EvE PvP is a lot like several games of rock paper scissors at the same time. DPS (fast vs. volley) vs. Tank (shield vs. armor, active vs. buffer, resists vs. raw hp),  Neuts vs. Nos vs. Batteries vs. Injectors, Range vs. Range control, Tracking vs. Signature  &amp; Transversal, etc. etc. 
---
That said, different ships depend on these concepts to different degrees, so by picking one ship and fit you can narrow things down a bit whilst learning the ropes. 
---
When was the last time you saw a shield titan with armor tank? 
---
When was the last time you saw a clone bay on a titan?
---
Personally it was hard to learn because in the beginning you lose and you do not even know what you could have done better. Eventually, after many failures things start to make sense.

TEST are really on a roll, huh

Also like 5% damage and 5% application and 2% rate of fire and 5% falloff(more application) and suddenly you are looking at 30-40% more damage.
---
I no see any problems with capitals like carriers in this fight. We good aplicate dmg and kill some command destroyers in close combat, just Heavy neuts and Dromi squads + Target Painter support from our armor Nidhogurs give a not bad aplication. Big mistake what we have its a fleet warp where we miss one group of carriers on cyno spot at 200km from Rorqs, this is big mistake and we pay for this like all dead caps. Second problem is not good Rorq fits and one Rorq with cyno got dissconect so we jump to cyno at 200km and start aline for fleet warp. Also sory for my bad english and sure its good fight. Its interesting got experience in fighting against Init or PL stuka fleet, its really difficult but cool.

clonebay stops you from jumping by accident when you wanna bridge, so I could see it

Easy there, Stannis.

Na man no time for that all about the time efficiency 
---
So lets say that CCP will nerf the application to 20% of current.        
---
So just 4 more carriers ... like cmon - BEFORE - capital changes i alone had 4 capital chars just to ease with moving and fatigue ( so yeah fatigue made me skill more capital chars ) now i have 7.         
---
2 of them where combat ready before changes now 6 one is skilling as Steam sub is cheap - don't login it even for any thing now.        
---
Those things are here - also if you care all those are having serious subcapital skills like recons/maxed t3/hacs or logi. 
---
a rorqual in highsec ??
---
I always thought the mentality of "we must have a good killboard!" seemed kind of dumb to be honest. Everytime I've lost a ship I learned something from it. Telling newbros to not fly solo and learn is just wrong.  
---
As for the suicidal gamble, one of my favorite eve moments was fighting a small UK firetail gang(+logi) with a similar size punisher gang with 2 AF's as some support. They had been chasing us around for 10 or 15 min but eventually  Jamer said "fuck it" and fleet warped us in. It was probably the most fun I've had in EVE so far and we were ecstatic went we came out on top. Looking back, it wasn't really like we had a bad chance at winning, but for a bunch of newbros to beat the one entity that were constantly fighting and losing to, it felt amazing.

He was just salvaging when he had time and flying on every fleet he could for fun.

He quit the game as he burned out very fast - yet he did inject around 12mil sp .

I want to shoot you in the face so bad.

That's a lot of stuff

Think this was more of a boosh away before fighters get to you fleet.

should be nice, hope to see a lot of the older guys who remember him from back in the day there. 5 years on since we last played together and i still remember a lot of stories about the guy, he was one of the kindest guys you could ever meet, 
---
I'll wager he's relaying some dinobrain's rationalization (despite the fact that we killed their feroxes at 2:1 while also wiping their logi and links.

How is that a comparison lol. Init planned that a year in advance. And it was hardly kitchen sink Ravens. It's a strict doctrine.

I paid 5bil for 49mil sp char like 4 months before extractors where announced.

It was industry char and no one wanted it :D

It just looks that hard because there's very little "easing in". It really isn't that much more complex than games like Dota for example. At least if you stick to the PVP part.

Because it wouldn't be a challenge for the groups who own the space and would get easily farmed like everything else.

This is i think the best story i have ever heard coming from Eve.   Eve is different Then other games. So are the people.

He didn't have it in quotes when I replied. Thought he was being srs//flairbaiting.

This is total bullshit

CCP already tried to nerf them

Hope so too. You're more than welcome to pop along. He was a sound dude, headstrong and willing to help anyone. The amount of people he knew in Eve actually astounds me, very popular. Hope for a decent sized fleet.

Recently returned and heard that while roaming I can drop loot into hostile citadels and asset safety them later.  I've deposited a bit of loot but cannot determine how to activate this asset safety.  I have to take an extended break from the game again soon and was hoping to get the timer cooking while I'm away. Thanks.

One would have to be straight up retarded to tell snuff that you are going to have a super move op lol
---
I use a set up of a sac, deimos, gila, and vaga to run exotic, firestorm, gamma, and electrical respectively. They are all capable of running t3/t4 but the deimos is kind of sketchy for t4. They aren't exactly speed runners but they are all 700 mil or less. For me this makes abyss running more fun as it provides a large amount of variety compared to only using drones for pve. 
---
I thank guys like this, there have been some times I have been ferrying stuff under sketchy value/tank ratios in T1 industrials through high-sec choke points; however there are always a more lucrative target autopiloting turbo shitfitted loot pinatas that act as a shield of diversion. They are the true heroes.
---
Yeah that's par for the course with Aslon. No joke since I've left Winmatar they've tried to invite me back three times (I shit you not, one of those just happened 10 min ago bc I spoke in mil chat). But they don't say "we've improved!" or anything it always hints that *I* was the one who made a mistake.

Seems about right

NANIII??!!!

Imagine taking the game seriously enough to try fine members lmfao 
---
Thanks! Its working now
---
you just have to choose an irrelevant one and figure out how to make it shine, I have on multiple occasions annoyed the hell out of my ticks/s corpmates by flying in some oddball ships just because i felt like it. an they were rather effective at their jobs i might add.
---
You'd think that Vily would know better than telling Hy Wanto tho
---
Nope. Let say that the issue begins when someone can put up a fleet of 50 titans.          
---
Until someone get 50 people with titans - there is no issue - so there can be 300 titans ingame but no real issue.     
---
Process of getting 50 titans can take years. 
---
Now if you know that you can abuse something by having 50 titans you just inject them.            
---
Bad but simple example.        
---
Funny, cause without local, wars in highsec would be pushed even more to just gate / station camping.
---
they cant do anything other than be a mainline fleet doctrine
---
they suck at pve

and they are not good at solo pvp
---
Dust money. Mm
---
Injectors are not part of the game but part of CCP income scheme.

No company will agree to remove big part of the income because it makes someone unhappy - especially that i bet it is currently much bigger income stream than cash from subscriptions.

Here's the bit I don't get; how does it benefit anyone to have them around? I hear their Fort in Kam gets defended by 3rd parties but they're a literal turd that turn people off the game, low-sec, FW and Amarr mil.  Whether they realise it or not, those members would be better off almost anywhere else.

Good on you mate

Someone just quit eve...
---
There doesn't need to be "counterplay" to a non-interacting observer. Eve was designed to not restrict players from knowing the state of their opponent, hence things like local, dscan, covert ops, and esi tools like dotlan.
---
There would need to be counterplay if that person could say, lower military indexes simply by the virtue of being cloaked in system and untouchable. However, in order to do this, the cloaked player has to take a risk and decloak before doing anything interactive with the system. However, with cloaky eyes, this is not the case. It's the same way that there's "no counterplay" to someone staying docked in their AT ship. There's no way to counter them not doing anything with it, but at the same time they aren't interfering with the system around them or preventing other people from playing the game, so it's also not a problem that needs to be solved. 
---
&gt;Until someone get 50 people with titans - there is no issue 
---
There is an issue, just not one that you currently see.
---
Much like someone with an undiagnosed disease is sick.  They don't become sick when they are diagnosed.
---
They are part of the game. The claim was that they are part of the game so we should just accept. But this is not the case.

Look at those awesome avatars.

There are some good guys around on both sides and lots of good chilled out corps, but since citadels the prestige of home system evictions has been lost and the scale just isn't the same anymore.

Are you trying to imply his power can be quantified? Be grateful he showed you mercy for saying that.

PRETTY WEIRD BUD

I had the issue that both my Feroxes kept getting jammed. We had drones on the Azbel so there wasn‚Äôt much jamming back. 
---
Some skills are gated behind being omega, which are indeed "turned off" until you sub again, and also cannot be trained. However, those skills will become active again once you sub.
---
GF, thanks for bringing the fight guys! 
---
Sounds like things are going well. Also glad to see your experience in game dealing with us in the F-V pocket and your mini-moon empire is getting put to good use in real life.
---
Would it be a dick move to boson the entire fleet?

---
It doesn't benefit anyone and I honestly have zero idea why they continue to recruit and stick around. Maybe Aslon just likes calling in third parties to win fights for him. Maybe he wants to run a successful corp but fucks up at every.single.step. My bet is on the latter, guy wants to run a alliance and not only thinks but *believes* he knows how despite everything. So he swings his dick around and calls in third parties to win fights when his nados dont break t2 logi and ferox's. There was multiple times he would rage ping for defence of a fort, hype it up, and then bail to go to a party and leave the fleet to someone else without telling them wtf was going on or what to fly.

Reddit we apologize sometimes are retard let's himself out of the cage. 
---
Oh man it's the idiot tax from -FE- all over again. 
---
If you can save excavs with wetus still you‚Äôre just gonna see people cheap fit the rorq, insure it, say it dies well cap insurance is great and you‚Äôve still got your excavators 
---
My three solo kills in a Ferox in around 2005 beg to differ. 
---
It might not have been a Ferox actually.
---
Alternate cyno jammer idea, keep everything about the jammer the same but ships jumping to a cyno in range of an active cyno jammer tigger a sun bounce as if the cyno was destroyed.
---
People didn't run 120 accounts each training three characters just to eventually sell those characters on the bazar.
---
The problem isn't skill injectors in itself, it's that you can create huge SP farms.
---
The initial idea for injectors is decent-ish, as if sp farming wasn't viable, the total amount of sp in the game would ahve actually decreased, not increased. Whereas now with thousands upon thousands of characters doing nothing but farming sp (and only being used for that purpose and nothing else) the de-facto SP supply for "used" characters has not only not gone down, it has exploded exponentially.
---
i have over 50 solo kills with a ferox, my point stands
---
Is this a copypasta?
---
I'm all for Local in High and Low, since they're still considered Faction space. But I think Null should behave like Wormholes unless you set up a Sov service to turn it back on. 
---
it is a bad way to fix it. but all the rage here seems to be off base. issue isnt caring too much about the killboard, issue IS feeding to highsec wardecs, going to keep you on their list. best solution is a non-wardecable logistics corp so you dont need to give af. sure caring too much about the KB is one thing, caring about folks repeating avoidable mistakes is another.
---
So i can walk in stations now....? No. 
---
Hah I remember when they camped Gidali, I would bait them a few times on heavily tanked transports (they used max dps vexors back then). That was a year ago, nice to see they still at it.
---
OVERHEAT EVERYTHING
---
also with the lights on 
---
Your a credit to yourself, well done. EVE did the same for me. If it wasn't for a random bloke in game who put me in touch with a recruiter friend of his I'd be in the gutter still.
---
I'm now in well paid job and have a standard of living I could only have dreamed of.  Fly safe mate. o7
---
Struggle snuggles are optional except when they are not
---
Why so Querious?
---
If someone can multibox 15 rapid heavy phoons and win against another gang then more power to him. That not many players in the game can efficiently multibox even half of that many accounts in subcaps, much less do it well, much less in the heat of a battle, and even much less if you have to multibox support ships like sabres or cepters

Omg i didnt see these two before they are fucking amazing
---
I mean, he'd probably have found that hilarious... But yeah, no thanks haha
---
So the information on a show info window on a module in game, or a hull in game, or even the skills required to fly the ship in game, *are not readily available*? 
---
You can put up a public item exchange contract from anywhere.  Price it low and it'll sell.
---
You can also put up a public courier contract from anywhere.  If they've got JFs regularly moving stuff to trade hubs, someone will move it for you if you price it well.
---
Have no idea how I never got jammed, it was like a having a cloud around me.
---
After my Attack on Titan heart
---
Just like the rest of us...

Find the items in the "assets" window -&gt; right-click -&gt; send to asset safety.

Thanks.  Do you need to be in the same system as the assets?
---
I‚Äôve been playing on and off since 2010, so not really a newbie, I just suck at it üòÇ
---
The donut is soft and moist
---
I don't believe so. 
---
:huyonis: 
---
well he didn't say he was going amamake or that he wasn't hostile
---
So what you're saying is, you have to put time into the game before you can do the advanced stuff.
---
In other words, *every game, ever*.
---
Go jump into WoW, tell me how you started end game raiding after the first day.
---
&gt; Let's not pretend this game is deep enough to justify all this downtime
---
Yeah, aoe zergfests are so deep. If you think 99% of fleets are the kind you get in major null battles, you really don't know anything about EVE.
---
But would you like "more ops, more goals, more coordination" and "some of the largest and most well organized fleet operations in faction warfare"? 
---
Okay, figured it out. I need to click the citadel and not the assets itself.  Thanks again for the help!
---
Ooh mean words.  However will I cope. 
---
It's even worse when you take into account how big % of the cost insurance is

Blockaded into submission

You're just upset we have better memes than you
---
Nah, doesnt look like lowsec cyno bait
---
Dont we all
---
You had almost 5x the numbers how are you this fucking dense?
---
Sure, but you could have the delay come in when the small ships right click the titan to "jump through".  This isn't a hugely problematic issue to solve.
---
Come to think of it, it could also be solved with two cyno modules, one for subcaps and one for caps.
---
i think youre taking this way too personal buddy

I don't think that comment was talking specifically about the exploration activity

"feeding"
---
This. The de-facto SP supply of used pilots has increased an insane amount due to SP farms, the first step to combat the injector problem (assuming we don't want to outright get them out of the game) is to up the required SP to extract way beyond what alphas can train (probably 10 mil or so) and then up extractor prices to such a degree that you can't plex an account simply by farming SP.
---
Injectors without people running 100+ accounts just to extract SP every month is much less of an issue.
---
tbh the more he says the more he shows he shouldn't fc anymore
---
This is beautiful, you've out done yourself yonis
---
As a participant I would like to throw out some suggestions on the execution.
---
1) Thunderdome being on the the current patch.
---
2) MJD Beacons
---
3) Better consistency in the explanation of the pick / ban process in the later rounds.
---
4) Let us handle the ships and either use the tool or ship scan for rules. Passing the ships and fits out to us was an unneccessary complication.
---
That said, this was a pretty fun and casual tournament. I enjoyed it.
---
no he didn't explicitly say those things, but this isn't a "new" thing. The reason i called and asked is because generally when you have a working relationship to the level we do you don't mislead or lie about those things.
---
Like when we said we would SRP all snuff's dreads from the bomb last week we didn't say "well we will only SRP at 1isk cause we never explicitly gave a value" we asked the value and gave him the check because thats generally how these type of relationships work. 
---
&gt;  today it will hurt you unsubbing your Titan Pilot while running a skillfarm.
---
There's also no need since you can just extract to keep an account plexed indefinitely without any effort.
---
which was the same as last time
---
Since when did sp replace actual player skill? Cheating implies replacing skill and that's not the case. This is such a lame excuse to wage war on injectors when there are more valid reasons to be upset about them. The people who know what they're doing and injecting are the problem. It's not cheating, it's just proliferation in the micro scale and anyone with any game knowledge can do it. 
---
No, it's weird you fucking pretty nerd üòö
---
Seems like you put a lot of faith in an alliance notorious for breaking deals, even whilst Hy is obviously pussy-footing around the question.
---
At least you moved everything 1by1 instead of like another shield capital alliance that comes to mind.
---
The moment when you realize not everyone wants the Blue donut. F
---
do it pls
---
Maybe cut the fights against stuff below your ship class like comets, especially when using implants and stuff, other than that good vid
---
does the R in your name stand for retard?
---
Backstabau
---
I figured wormholer's might not like the "structures good vs subcaps" that would only work for C5 to C5 connections / C6 space, otherwise you're going to suicide a lot of subcaps to kill structures. Wouldn't this make c4 and below space with nice bearing statics extremely desirable? Maybe unhealthily so?
---
Everything else seems really solid on the page.
---
guess you read the relationship wrong then, you're not blues, don't know what you would expect
---
also, snuff is snuff 
---
why even bother taking logi with you if you alpha each other anyways...
---
Because it appears that you significantly lack understanding of how fighters /carriers/supers currently work. It just makes you look silly..
---
To expand slightly on the other answer - nano gangs are indeed small gangs (usually 5-10 pilots), that rely on agility and speed to give them an edge in PvP. Being faster than most other ships of their size lets them engage targets of opportunity, but also disengage from fights that get too difficult. 
---
They usually specialize in fighting against the odds, versus bigger ships and bigger fleets. Check out some videos here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eM7W9oVbv3s
---
Did I at least jam you once? :') 
---
WTB Ninazu KM still nowhere to be found
---
dunno why you trusted snuff but sucks for u I guess 
---
I'm pretty sure we all will have good use of this information
---
Not very good for a trailer though is it
---
So you are absolutely behind the idea that a person who started yesterday SHOULD be equal to someone who started playing 10 years ago? Yes, injectors should get the new person close enough for a decent fight and even a reasonable chance to win, but the elder player should have 1-2% better chance. Their loyalty to the game deserves that much at least. 
---
I also, have a large e-penis, let us all talk about this.
---
Really surprises me that the Inferno trailer doesn't get brought up when people are talking about their favorite official videos more often.
---
*Cough* didn't mention alpha - omega differences *cough*
---
when was the last time we took one? i feel like this is less of a "nerf" to amarr than it is a godsend for everyone else 
---
im sure it would be possible to somehow not filter some things like "www" and stuff like that or only apply it to  jita 
---
Cheers mate will take it into consideration :)
---
Now hang on, I've met some Horde FCs who could use this.
---
gee I hope not, that would mean I spent 4 minutes typing a copypasta.
---
This doesn't show anything for me and I know there's at least 5 other characters on the same planet.
---
Its not a bug....
---
But does it?
---
Does it really?
---
I thought most of them had cockatiels.
---
high sec gets to enjoy tidi, too?  
---
looks like gfs all around
---
How about such gems as"We encourage solo, small and micro-gang content aswell as larger fleets and FW fighting." and "I personally guarantee you will not be disappointed with the content and action you find with WMTR alliance."
---
Nobody did. I have no idea how I got away with it
---
Shows just how much aslons personal guarantees are worth. 
---
Our, hahahahahah
---
Usually it's corps that suck mechanically as well lmao
---
if you let them attack your structure in low power for months eventually they actually kill it  
---
we had at least 1 raitaru die on our HS island that way 
---
I'm not talking a major buff, &lt;5% total advantage...enough that you can win close to half the battles against your kid in the same ship, but everything else being equal he would win 6 of 10 on average because of actual playing time.
---
But for as long as you've played the game, I should not be able to start today and go 1v1 against you in anything as an even match. I should be able to get close, and beat you with a little luck on my side...but not expect an even match. And I don't think any truly new player would expect to be an even match against someone who has played for years either. Most would be quite happy with close.
---
Rip
---
tl:dr ?
---
Capital we're fine before rorquals. Skill injectors we're fine. Together, they make this.
---
cAsiiNo wAR!11!!1i

Sorry bud.

He was actually in our corp for about five days
---
Whoa ran some is still alive?  Fuck yeah dude!!! 
---
I come from a community of Eve players some would consider the worst of us: griefers, gankers, scammers, and wardeccers. Those people have turned out to be among the best I've ever met in decades of gaming. Some of them have become close friends. 
---
Its pretty fun atm, with active moon mining there are always targets to shoot and force a fight :)
---
Who even accepted the "it will help new players" argument? When I was new, I was running Lvl 3 missions in a railgun brutix. Try making 1,5+ bil off of that. Even when I got more into the game, it still took me more than a month to make my first billion. Am I going to drop that on what equates to maybe a week of training? Fuck no. 
---
Yes, of course ^^
---
But it‚Äôs like scanning the cans in a relic site : it takes away the feeling of opening a Christmas present, but also take away that let down thought when there‚Äôs only the OPE in the wreck.
---
And how they do half as much dps with worse fitting for tank?
---
yes thats what i said, but the context of our working relationship hasnt changed in over two years, since before we moved south, so i mean i guess as i said later. "it is what it is"
---
Literally all you have to do is have (yet another) alt cloaked on grid with your 30 rorqs ready to light a cyno 
---
was actually 2 by 2 as we had like 40 to move and i wasn't down to take an hour, but one of the Nyx was chinese and he dethered to defend the titans with his fighters cause he didn't understand sounds like. 
---
Wouldnt be too bad if it encourages active gameplay, the armies of cloaky camping toons are annoying. But speaking from experience, being camped by lokis for months that fuck up your vni as a noob sucks big time and that kind of shit drives people from the game.
---
After you establish your new family more, and if the opportunity presents itself, do the same that was done for you for someone else. Make that circle complete.
---
bruh you refused to work with tri because they were content whores, the fuck were you expecting out of snuff ?  
---
big thonk
---
&gt; There doesn't need to be "counterplay" to a non-interacting observer.
---
By providing intel they are interacting though. Sit on grid with a gate, have perfect intel of not only who comes and goes but what ships they are in. That's not 'doing nothing.' and it's more intel than someone just watching local docked up can give.
---
The drawback that would best balance cynos is a bare minimum 60 second activation time.  No more using caps or supers to *catch* things with Sirens, which are pretty much interceptors with better stats.  No more surprise sex for subcap fleets -- the moment they see the cyno on grid they have to fight or fleet, kill the cyno(s) or gtfo.  But they have that choice, rather than being insta-raped by ametats.
---
love how they dont even mention lowsec
---
Made some of my best friends in Eve in TEST.  Would certainly recommend joining to see if it‚Äôs right for you.
---
You just needed something more toxic in life than you, and you found Eve. Glad all is good and congrats on the engagement.
---
as a member of tri, I can confirm, there was much confusion when NC seemingly appeared out of no-where.
---
Fly cheap ships, train looting to V, and make sure to be at 0 on blingy stuff when it dies, with your prop mod off
---
Came in here expecting a "be Sort Dragon" post, but I am actually not disappointed by this.
---
your not wrong, but we have worked with snuff for over two years since before we even went south. 
---
That kind of rule is literately the fastest way there is to kill a corp/alliance 
---
Van confirm. I've been winning eve for 2 years and saved zero money because I purchase a stupid amount of games now and nothing ever catches me. I'm paying for subscriptions on games I don't play because I'm afraid of going back to eve and have 2 jobs again.
---
we had moros/dread pilot farms 
---
I'm currently a nomad. I'm docked a a random station and just... wasting away. Remembering better days...
---
"Unexplored space that hold their own secrets."
---
\&gt;Proceeds to show shattered WH space lore, which they abondoned in order to make more SKINs.
---
yea sure...
---
Also you forgot to mention one thing about the big fleet fights: You have to bring a subcap main, dread alt, FAX alt to rep the dread alt and titan alts on standby.
---
That would be pretty overpowered 
---
listen look at the title
