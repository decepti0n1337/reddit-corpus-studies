It is Not what you think it is
---

---
This "rent" is nothing more then an ISK sink created to Support the eco as you know that a System that gets constantly Cash injected but no Cash taken from it is on the Highway to Inflation.
---
So this System in particular along with any other NPC fees like jita trading fees or npc Station repair fees are Designer to just blanace the scale and concord Was used to make it emergant could aswell be CCP alliance or even interbus
---
---
---
&gt; ...since for PvP you allways take less sigbloom.
---
But it is not so! Sometimes you will happily trade sig bloom for speed or cap! You could be flying a bonused ship, or your plan could involve being far enough away from the enemy that your signature won't matter so much.
---
In any case this is different from the situation where you would only fit T2S ewar modules if you literally did not know what they were: more expensive, harder-to-fit versions of M4-or-worse. The balance pass that fixed that situation is an undervalued example of something CCP did right IMO.
---
Confirming hes high. I have significantly more experience than the one year hes boasting
---
I disagree about "the only Thing to fix Titan issues it to introduce Titan Killers". 
---
* Caps and subcaps target ships with the same mechanics. 
---
* Caps and subcaps activate modules with the same mechanics. 
---
* Caps and subcaps move and warp with the same mechanics. 
---
Capitals are like big teleporting subcaps that have fuel costs. I know this is an unpopular opinion, but capital gameplay should go *more* in the direction of Bosons, Lances, and ewar projectors. My reasoning for this is; these are all mechanics that require some manual aiming. Anything done by a person is subject to errors and mistakes. 
---
Good content happens when people fuck up. Jumping instead of bridging. Loading the wrong fuel. Shit like that. Capitals of all sizes need more ways for pilots to fuck up. 
---
That's how you fix capital balance.
---
Congrats !
---
Congratulations! Awesome moment!

&gt; criticism
---
aint salt  and welcome but the titel of the post  is just tasty.
---
WOW classic will release to huge numbers and great success then over the course of a few weeks to a few months players will start to remember WOW is actually not a fun game at all.
---
Thats how you fix their role in the meta but Not their proliferation which is the Thing ccp trys to adjust in ways that seem "dumb af" to those who are confronted with this
---
There's a massive misconception in the gaming industry that paying for something that gives you an advantage that you can just get through playing the game for hours/days isn't pay to win is beyond naive.
---
The only reason EVE has lasted so long as P2W while other games that are heavily pvp based die faster than you can blink with the same model of paying for something you can just play/wait hours for is because the payers can lose what they pay for (not the skill points though)..
---
Time locked progression is also bad mmmmmkay.
---
3 of my toons look equally. But more like only 1M SP or so left that i haven't redeemed :) 
---
Free SP is like money ... you know you want it and when you get it you save it, since there is nothing too important to use it right now :D
---
I’d like to see the responsiveness of local vary nonlinearly with a change in system population:  onesies and twosies never get reported; small gang might take three minutes to register; a hundred bridge in on a cyno or pop across a gate, instant alert.
---
yes my fear is that ccp brings observatories in and we end up with even more intel than beofre :X
---
I'm glad the Russians utilized the same tactics in eve that they do in the US presidential elections.
---
I shifted from ratting to missions and things are going great. There are other lucrative ways to make isk, but you've gotta be willing to change.
---
armour hacs..Armour Hacs...ARMOUR HACS!!!!
---
I may be able to attend, the day and time is right and I'm just across the river in Spuncouver. Crank County. In the great state of WatchMeSpin.
---
How're these meth jokes workin' for ya?
---
You can just call me Fluff. Short for FluffySpaceBunny.
---
They proliferate because they're desirable. They're desirable because F1 monkeys can use them effectively. 
---
If you make them require concentration and effort to use, then F1 monkeys won't use them effectively, and won't rush to getting them.
---
Like faction warfare?
---
Woah there buddy, It sounds like your responding venomously to a thought you don't agree with.  
---
By throwing a tantrum in a reddit thread.  
---
coming across as a bit coo-coo  
---
perhaps you need to take a step back and *- woah hey this looks a lot like your post!*
---
Sarcasm aside, Olmeca is on the CSM, a lot of people voted for him to get there because they agree with his points, perhaps you should clear some of that angry froth from the corner of your mouth and put forward some counterpoints, *because that might be more effective,* who knows, people might be more inclined to read your post if you made a well measured response.
---
I mean, people do make that argument.
---
I wouldnt exactly call a super effortless to pilot but thats a different story.
---
The Things you desire would move them in a Position where they are almost useless which will as a result also affect the future wars and eves presence in the Media since we wont even scratch the records from cap era with the way the Population is going
---
Counterpoints: “your playstyle is wrong because fuck you” is his entire stance and that’s unhealthy.
---
Period
---
Wait didn’t sharo sell out or rob one of the corps he was in?
---
i agree... super and titan dps application is too much and forces everyone to use stukas atm which is sad
---
nope. Local in NS makes no sense.
---
Because teamwork is essential in finding new friends in eve online.
---
Can confirm,   
---
I came back after a break because the AT peaked my interest again and I stayed \^\^
---
because it would require adding sentries on the gate if truesec increases above 0, but the benfit would be very small (only less anoms)
---
You sound like a bot that has no idea what it's responding to.
---
He's saying that the game is currently catering to/is heavily unbalanced in the favour of, one particular play-style and is arguing for a more balanced approach to the game. 
---
I didn't take away from his comments that he thought a play-style was 'wrong', *but perhaps that's because I don't think he's personally attacking me?*
---
Confirmed CCP is CONCORD.
---
Two great ideas in a row :D
---
&gt;HAW-Guns are now polarized on titans (0 resists)
---
HAHAHHAHAHAH.
---
Yes please.
---
I watched it every time even when on hiatus from the universe.
---
Who cares. I'd rather play with 10k players who are actual players than 60k with 50k of that bots.  Bye.
---
80+ crabbing what!?
---
marshy is that you?
---
This is the law straw you goddamn gopniks, that was my last DRAKE NAVY!
---
im sorry to hear that :( i too get triggered about haw dreads from time to time
---
i agree... always said faxes destroy content and same as haw dreads its very hard for people to see the fights that never happen
---
&gt;The Things you desire would move them in a Position where they are  almost useless which will as a result also affect the future wars and eves presence in the Media since we wont even scratch the records from cap era with the way the Population is going
---
The recent World Tour presentations have been showing that *shitloads* of new players are joining, but +90% are quitting within three months. This is getting sidetracked, but Eve's new-player problems are about retention, not about exposure. 
---
It's not that I disagree with your truthfulness of you point, but that I don't think that line of thinking is at all relevant.
---
You dont. When you go bed you scoop the thing.
---
Well it would be fair, just not for the next generation
---
i long for the days of my smoking wreck of a \[insert frigate hull\] zipping about the gang/fleet eagerly awaiting a station system for hull reps along our route.......
---
dude I'm honestly really sorry about that. I'll be the first to admit it was some garbage-tier FCing. IDK if you picked it up from comms, but Them was supposed to be the FC and handling prep, I was just chilling in the capital wing sorting my carrier fit. Then it's go-time and oh shit, _someone_ needs to undock the fleet.
---
that would make signature a good thing, while it is supposed to be a bad one.
---
make them based on total HP instead.
---
To kill a cloaky proteus that thinks it'sa real ship* 
---
Fixed.
---
*said the guy who didn't even try*
---
Alright. Nerf them too then.
---
The retention is a really big issue and again home made by ccp but also a can of worms i wont open here.
---
In reality it takes both Marketing and npe to to engage New players and make then stay.
---
On the proliferation Part there is an easy fix.
---
Why do null empires hold so many caps? Right they get the isk and im full on point with caps should be pvp Tools.
---
So instead of going After cynos nerf the payout for caps in ratting by a certain margin. Ccp can Do this as we saw it with the toasting caps in fozzie sov.
---
This is really attracting people to caps. Not the easy to get in Part but more the must have for isk Part. And im still stating this while i do make most of my money helping the Bad ones to replace their shit.
---
Tbh ratting caps were a mistake
---
Easier hygiene lol that's like complaining about taking an extra one footstep to get from your car to your front door. It's irrelevant when it takes so little time to clean yourself.
---
this is an *excellent* concept for Eve Online.  Well thought out man.
---
Thank you for the reply. Which ones do you think are good/bad and why? What stands out in particular to you?
---
Oof. Contact signal cartel. They'll find it
---
SHEKELSQUAD RISE FROM THE ASHES OF BEANS DO IT
---
I've had this argument with idiots on this sub so many times. They don't understand that demand for plex increases sales of plex for cash.
---
I have been pushing like you called it ‘organic’ system ss back in 2011 or even earlier. No one cared.   
---
I do like your list with exceptions, but its almost as a roadmap from person who plays the game. Unlike the devs.
---
Stront might be annoying, but there's something to be said for having to do math under pressure. There's a chance you might fuck it up or not figure it out in time.
---
More than one keepstar for NPC null could be a thing, I was thinking it had the advantage of creating a hotspot of activity.
---
Can't blame the FC when there's 15 options to choose from
---
Mounting dormant sentries on gates that activate on a system status change will be easy. Also the change might happen at DT.
---
However, cookie clicker is not fun and eve is not 100% sandbox.
---
Only wormholes can feed this hard
---
In his defence, no one else stepped up to fc
---
If nobody uses haws on titans anymore that would be an acceptable result :)
---
Just make it cap at 0 max, and if needed tweak the NPCs, bounties, anoms of different -1 to 0 secs.
---

---
bounties are not affected by truesec.
---
&gt; Why should we be paying concord if they don't provide anything to us?
---
They might not protect the gates, but don't they keep them running? Would be a shame if they just turned them off and you had to slowboat from system to system.
---
except now instead of having no bots and only players you have only bots and no players...
---
well banning alpha bots and shit, is like sisiphos work. it never reaches an end. got banned with ur 40 alpha toons. no problem create 40 new ones. and since vpn is a thing, ip ban doesnt help either.
---
you could only avoid that stuff, by not giving those bot corps a renting home in your space....ccp should enforce responsible people to make sure they dont house bots , and yes u can sort that out pretty easy by logs...23/7 tax payment is kinda obvious isnt it?
---
if ccp really wanted to get rid of bots. they would punish the alliances who rent out to obvious botters, by confiscating a lot of isk from their wallest or confiscate assets.
---
imagine botters having hard times finding a home to bot in, cuz every possible entity they could rant from would be like " ehmm nope i wont touch that hot iron and burn my fingers...."
---
im a pessisimist at heart. so i say, shit will never be solved . maybe i will be positivly surprised one day, by an actual sound and viable solution brought up by ccp....but i doubt that.
---
alpha status was a big mistake in the first place. next to injectors and rorqual changes ..change my mind.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
tldr: bots bad mmmkay?
---
I've been on fleets with Beans before and the autistic screeching on their comms must have been ear pearcing.
---
dey took err jerbs!
---
it will still retain a bunch of players, possibly ones that never got to play classic or some diehard classic fanboys. I just don't see the point of repeating something that's already been done before...
---
Real screenshot from when they broke it this morning.  
---
This was just a satirical post relating to the new Era of Chaos  
---
You're late to the party
---
That is one thing only. A lot of other things are hardcoded and could not accept with the modification.
---
eg the rigs of the citadel would need to update the status every time the truesec is changed. Also, the quality of the  relic/data could be changed (LS can't have l4 sites IIRC) . what wouldhappen if a signature is already present in a NS system and it becomes LS( superior covert research facility)? What if a WH has an exit towards LS only ? etc, etc.
---
No thanks, they're worse than wormholers btw. "I can't roam, I have practice." or "I can't make that fleet because we're going over fits." and on and on and on.
---
Then let players provide them, we pay a cost for certain things they provide and now they started providing less. Either the cost should be reduced or players should be allowed to provide for themselves. Personally I think the later option but thay requires ccp to actually produce something.
---
Shit ton of it is probably bots so looking all good.
---
I honestly won't be surprised if they bring it back before October deadline with Pearl Abyss, Hilmar wants that fat paycheck...
---
Just fix it in the status section. Lowsec cant go hisec, nullsec cant go lowsec.
---
Most of those are reasonable, but I really think Observatories should be the "blackout preventer" and consume a metric fuck ton of fuel. If you have an Observatory you get local. If you don't, you don't. If anchorable in hostile space, it should create some interesting situations too.
---
Ya honestly I get that. My intention isn't to make things harder for PVE players, it's to make more things die on the higher end of the game, while also allowing an economy that allows for increasing rewards due to more rapid ship turn over.
---
Anyone who steps up in an attempt to organize such a shitshow deserves kudos. The big mistakes were made a while ago.
---
Any post concerning wormholes is satire.
---
Wormholes btw
---
What's stopping them from literally making an official PLEX betting service for the AT? It would be in an ingame currency so probably would dodge all the casino industry requirements?
---
What are you suggesting? Keep a dozen anti bomb dessies on grid with every Rorqual?
---
You don't do an excessive amount of thinking before posting, do you...
---
You are aware that chart is set to one year.. meaning it's the same summer time for each point.
---
&gt; I wish I got as much hate as you did ;-; I wanna become a retard 
---
FTFY
---
So essentially shattered WHs with extra steps?
---
&gt;So instead of going After cynos 
---
I also think the drastic cyno change was a bit ham-fisted. I do like the broad goal of making capital navigation difficult, but I think a smarter solution lies with changing jump-drives instead of cynos. If caps and supers are 'end game content' why are they so easy to navigate with?
---
&gt;nerf the payout for caps in ratting by a certain margin. 
---
I would be genuinely interested in this. Though it is a big buff to Blue Loot and OPE.
---
Why didn't you step up? Oh yeah because you're a useless backseat FC
---
[Time to make a change!](https://www.change.org/p/pearl-abyss-fire-hilmar-veigar-p%C3%A9tursson-aka-ccp-hilmar-without-any-golden-parachutes)
---
RIP MAX DEL
---
I have 5 subbed accounts. There are 2 toons per account. Think of it as two sets of 5. 
---
I live in two different wormholes. Essentially there is 1 "main" in each wormhole to support my main activities. 
---
Mining in one with skiffs/scouts in support. Also everyone does PI. Low class wormhole. Also main corp home and heavy T3 production. My slow and steady isk machine.
---
Other WH is for high end sites, gas and combat anom. Material gathering for other WH.
---
Basically it's a clone swap. Most of my pilots are trained into SB and pvp types below BC/T3C for null shenanigans. 
---
A couple toons filling the logistics roles as well. Also one toon for selling/buying in HS (can just drop from WHs at first HS system in chain and collect later so as not to get rolled out) and one FW toon.
---
A couple other throwaway sunesis scanning pilots for parking in target systems.
---
Lots to do! Easy to swap around.
---
Cross Counter!
---
This. I want to know when the game gets hard. The hardest part about eve is making the decision to warp in or warp out in the face of pvp. That feels like the whole game as a new player. Once a fight starts and the players are locked in the outcome is already pre-determined. I'd say only 10% of fights after engagement aren't predetermined and would come down to player skill but even that might be pushing it.
---
The blue loot is an issue thats Hard to solve the OPE is easy as they have the capabilitys to adopt to this
---
The idea basically would go as a buff where you get a site rated like the ded rating but for ships.
---
The more classes you are below that rating the bigger gets the payout buff but when you go above the rating you suffer heavy losses.
---
Needless to say that a ratting super would be the equivalent of nuking a Single house in the middle of nowhere and there for is getting a harsh penalty.
---
Also in the cynos even their movement isnt a issue it goes by the low requirements to get your hands on a fully operational beacon for the mightiest Things in Space.
---
So a) increase requirements to train cynos
---
B) Limit the ammount of jumping Things under certain conditions cause otherwise it would affect again the brawls that we Do Marketing with
---
Now that would be the ultimate twist.
---
Only went to a WH once.
---
It's a little hard to feel bad for a group of players who go on about risk vs reward when they have tended to create the safest areas in eve to null-bear around in. It's good to face some risk.
---
Yeah, higher security status means lower pirate spawns, which in turn makes mining safer.
---
Anyone got an AAR?  
---
Who was the spy/sellout?
---
I don't think you know what polarized weapons do
---
This would cause a game-ending deflation that would do nothing but benefit the people who have already earned their money.  I remember back in 2007, running from belt to belt in a Hulk making book marks on arkonor and nocxium-rocks and barely earning enough to support an itty5 alt through 300m ISK 90d GTCs.  When there was someone else in the system who managed to beat you to the belts, existence was pain.  There were weeks where the alt I was running high-sec missions in for datacore standings was getting far more income than my null characters.  Fortunately, between the occasional all-nighter to log in after downtime so I was first to the belts and chain-ratting 1.4m+ triple BS spawns,  I stuck to it long enough to get a dread and carrier.  Goonswarm took care of my ship replacements for years after that.
---
    
---
Resource scarcity is a good idea when everyone is on an even playing field.  It should be out of the question now until there are some serious resource sinks put into the game.  Keep in mind that the problem now isn't dense resources and more along the lines of "why should I risk fighting with my supercapitals even though I have a few dozen more back home?".  Get rid of the stockpiled ships and then address resource scarcity.
---
&gt;level 2
---
(if this is yuri A hi) but B you made a good call. People hate losing and they will bitch and bitch. the kid did good.
---
What content? They hide on test servers and practice. The rest of the time they cry about capitals dropping on them.
---
Townsend for 40b

---
Implying people play mmos for fun
---
They were originally going to do that but it ended up being possible to have doctors drop out of warp and bubble without being seen on dscan and before appearing on overview
---
Pretty [harsh]
---
 At this point in eve, adding new mechanics to the game designed to increase risk and remove wealth only encourages the weak to join the strong as the strong preys on the weak.
---
Nope, they wont help unless it’s a stranded player.
---
That seems a bit irrelevant in a thread about changes from what exists currently.
---
Honestly though I meant indirectly, in the sense that different and/or more rats and anoms spawn in lower sec, and that can be tweaked to be reasonable with a dynamic sec status in null.
---
Well, I’m not saying that ore amounts go down massively or everywhere, just that areas that are mined more become less profitable to mine. It’s more of a measure to hopefully prevent people from constantly sticking to one spot to mine, and encourage moving around. It doesn’t have to be a simple reduction in belt yields either. 
---
Maybe decrease the amount of ore anomalies, or maybe decrease only decrease the ores that are heavily mined (like if everybody was mining spod, less of it spawns).
---
I dunno, I'm not an expert on it. I just know they got real gunshy after the EU passed legislation
---
The problem is there are nothing to fight for. We used to fight each other because of economical reason and personal feud, but as the older generation go afk the feuds diminished. Goons' collapse in WWB and the subsequent reconstruction demonstrated that you cannot defend vast areas of space by yourself, and actually all that you need is to take one region to satisfy even the largest coalition.
---
Now, /r/eve is hell-bent on just nerfing null so people have to get more space to satisfy their needs --- but that's boring. Theoretically it should work, but plenty of players will just quit seeing that they are only losing stuff without getting more fun out of it. CCP needs to add something new, something that's worth fighting for.
---
I joined EVE at the end of Tyrannis, then played through Crucible, Invasion and went afk around 2014 before coming back in '16. There was a reason why that period, or slightly before that, was remembered as the golden age of EVE. We first had the addition of WHs in Apocrypha, then PI in Tyrannis, a lot of QoL upgrades in Crucible and Sanshas in Invasion. There are plenty of things to get excited about and to fight for --- the exploration of WHs, the re-establishment of PI material supply chains, Dust 514, and then obviously Sansha loot. It was also a time when faction rivalry was running high --- today, every coalition essentially follows the same formula and the same philosophy. The rivalry will probably never return to the same level as in 2012, but we desperately need something --- something *new*, not just tearing down the EVE we know about --- to have something to fight for. Special new space that has special properties or generate special new materials (e.g. skin materials)? Planetary flight? PI 2.0 with superstructures? Invasions against Empire space/Triglavian Space/Drifter space? Nomadic rat fleets that need to be hunted down for rewards? Reimagining the combat system? In any case, just making the game more clunky, like Blackout and the cyno changes ain't gonna cut it.
---
this is a game dude not public policy
---
there are a lot of old players on waffles that’s true, i wouldn’t be playing if i wasn’t here
---
If this happened it sure would be tempting for the Imperium to steamroll every keepstar on the map starting with panfam.
---
You could do those in a Raven.
---
Where is this? I’ve yet to find gates that look like that
---
My favourite part of it was our teamspeaks both suspiciously "not working" right as we engaged the russians :^ )
---
What they ought do is get rid of their current forum moderators who have completely killed the eve forums through over moderation and get the conversation about the game moved back to their own site. Deciding to co-opt the Reddit thread as the unofficial eve forums was one of the dumber decisions they have made, plenty of companies have made that mistake, but Eve was the only group dumb enough to not realize reddit subs are a shit show and reverse the decision.
---
&gt; inserts joke about no hands kekekeke
---
Yeah, just like how stranger dangers fax pilot just happened to disconnect during the final fight for hole control :,(
---
if there was no asset safety there would be so much steamrolling. it'd become a big thing on who can both attack and defend well enough to kill off stager keepstars while not losing any valuable keepstars on their own. would be p fun.
---
Multiple caps happened to DC during fights on holes, just unlucky tbh

It could be done nearly AFK and was scalable so you could complete a C6 in 15 mins with enough alts. Easily get 1.5bil+ an hour with minimal sp and isk investment (since you could do that in Ravens), just need the low-skilled alts.
---
Achieving these numbers normally, while tanking the sleepers, you usually need a dread and T2 logi, quite a bit more sp than fof.
---
How long have you played eve for? I played for 5 years.
---
Always step up in those situations holy shit.
---
Yeah you're definitely a bot.
---
Shifting topics to Investment in New Players
---
Whole team is focused on new players like never before. Looking specifically at player's first 30 hours and also the first 30 days. First 3 hours seem tough for new players.
---
Personally I left after 4 days because:
---
1. Bots make my efforts trivial
---
2. Community is too toxic (Competitive to the point of toxicity) and elitist
---
3. Just don't see a correlation between the beautiful looking game and the reality which upon investigating I found to be very much money-grubbing and looking turn a profit by CCP.
---
There are other people out there smarter than I am that have and/or have come to the same conclusion.
---
Solutions:
---
1. Squash the Bot problem once and for all and I mean all of it regardless of the consequences to long-entrenched Corps.
---
2. CCP stop coming harrasing New Players with blurbs to "Subscribe".  I got one the FIRST Hour I was in the game offering me a discount for the first month of subscription.
---
3.  Go back to a Subscription ONLY Model and come up with a way to get rid of the "Soul-Sucking" RMT!!
---
That's my piece and I will continue looking at this subreddit to see if things have changed but I'm out and staying out until things change for the better.

&gt;n the overwhelming majority of studies, women expressed a preference for the circumcised penis. The main reasons given for this preference were better appearance, better hygiene, reduced risk of infection, and enhanced sexual activity, including vaginal intercourse, manual stimulation, and fellatio. In studies that assessed mothers’ preference for MC of sons, health, disease prevention, and hygiene were cited as major reasons for this preference. Cultural differences in preference were evident among some of the studies examined. Nevertheless, a preference for a circumcised penis was seen in most populations regardless of the frequency of MC in the study setting.

Tell me, what is the sum of six, twelve, and the number of fingers on a normal human hand?
---
I love playing eve online and its political content.
---
So do you pick them by height, weight, or hair color?  Maybe skin tone?  I'm generally curious, I've never been able to hold conversation with a pedo for this long so this is scientifically uncharted territory.
---
How would you get the these systems though? If they don't have a Stargate in them already, someone is gonna need to slow boat out there.
---
odd flex
---
&gt; What's stopping them from literally making an official PLEX betting service for the AT?
---
Actual legislation regarding betting, basically. You're not required to be over 18 to play EVE. EVE is globally available. Every country has its own gambling rules and regulations, including age restrictions. It's basically impossible for them to have official gambling/betting that would be kosher with governments worldwide.
---
The closest I think they could ever get would be to have an in-game "stock market" that is *entirely* random and fluctuates percentage points from day-to-day and week-to-week. Maybe have random bumps based on lore events, but would otherwise be immune to manipulation by players and in no way driven by transactions like actual stock markets.
---
Tumbling down and down. :-)
---
I play eve online and not  attending a Mathematics lecture.

it also tells you if you look at the info on the system.

Which is true for reddit too btw lol.

What do you call the object in the center of the triangle whose corners are two eyes and a mouth?
---
What the actual fuck? Imagine being this retarded.
---
Lose a lot of bots to me so far
---
\^found the salty, grr-goon, high sec pleb.
---
Do you have CCP's ears or eyes?
---
Like do you call Hilmar on the phone to talk crazy shit or do you type to them?
---
The difference matters.
---
Just to add onto this, Yuri had maybe, MAYBE, 5 minutes notice that we needed to undock the fleet and fight.
---
Forget the farming, you polarize HAW dreads and you might as well remove them entirely from WH's.
---
Titans are most definitionally able to be balanced and they are the coolest hull in the game for many people. Not everyone likes small gang or even sub-cap fights. Many people prefer cap fights and want to see more of them.
---
So if we keep running Ad humans on Reddit you'll stop posting on reddit?
---
Brb, running to jabber.
---
Remove all anoms!! Ore only should come from moons.
---
TIS is ass cancer carebear circlejerk. It's amazing how much time the crew devotes to Eve and still lack anything close to a semblance of understanding it. Btw did you know Matterall knows Mittani?
---
TY.......whose Townsend btw?
---
Good, p much all that's left
---
i support everything but the fighter changes, haw guns only being polarized titans, and observatories not having a timer. if a cheap as mobile depot can have one then half a bill should have 1 timer. that haw gun titan seems very one sided guy, you want someone who's gone through everything to you need to do to buy or build a titan and then have him decide whether he wants 0 tank on 90 plus billion isk ship or just be fully countered by any group fitted with speed or thats simply smaller? thats insane, its like saying hey dude every high slot weapon system geared for shooting things smaller then you should be polarized. fighters get eaten up by any fleet thats smart enough to defang its target so why make such silly nerf. what i think is going to be nerfed nexted is the bomber.
---
There was a massive (actual) war last year over the summer, with some big fights that would have drawn in all the f1 monkeys
---
Lots of really decent ideas in there.
---
Yes, I agree with you.
---
I wish they'd bring back bettering tbh vOv
---
That was the most fun part of the AT lmao
---
Don't be. Dreads, ESPECIALLY HAW fit dreads are a menace but at the same time I'm wary about nerfing them too far when they do serve a valid purpose... They still shouldn't be able to hit anything smaller than a cruiser though
---
CCP is loosing active pilots due to the Blackout and other reasons.
---
Last I heard it was coming in a matter of weeks.
---
i wish goons would calm down their inane tryharding on reddit is getting tiresome
---
Why does this look batter than my Eve?  Settings tricks?
---
I’m surprised you were willing to “duel” with your T3C, did you loose lvl5 skill point? Isn’t that incredibly painful?  I ask because I’m extremely risk averse with my Tengu (used mostly for sneaky PVE in dangerous places), if I think there’s a decent chance of PvP or if I’m open to PvP... I’ll take something else (Stratios, Vexor navy, etc).
---

I’m not OP.

No EC drones?

Nice!!

Why does this look better than my Eve?  Settings tricks?
---
Thanks , deleted
---
you say that without realizing 9500 of them would be living in highsec and you'd be wandering around nullsec wondering why you can't find anyone.
---
Once you have a jump capable ship and the skills + fuel to use it, jumping is nothing more than two mouse clicks. Three clicks if you count lighting the cyno as well. 
---
I do believe that is an issue. 
---
When escalating with capitals, the job of making sure that dreads are dropped into their optimal firing range is given to a cyno ship. All dreads land 5,000 metres from that cyno. All the responsibility is concentrated into the one person. So one fuckup means a lot. Smart FCs will minimize risk by delegating this to trusted individuals, or do it themselves. 
---
Don't get me wrong, that is smart, *rational*, decision making by the players. What's happening is the most intelligent behaviour given the current mechanics of the game. 
---
I don't think raising the SP requirements to light cynos, or limiting cynos to more expensive ships changes this behaviour. I don't think it does enough to change the mechanics of jump-drives.
---
The alternative to the polarized haw titan is removing haw guns entirely from titans. This solution is just supposed to keep an option for crazy people thats all.
---
Depending on doctrine you can have real problems defganging fighters and the reason for the suggestion is not a 2 man carrier group. Once you swarmed by fighters your sub fleet is basically done. Too much tackled to rewarp.
---
except for the part where the bots are already being adapted to no local and real players are just quitting.
---
Except for all of the rat bounties. DED, A division of Concord, pays those.
---
Is having CCP's ear like having a toddler's nose? Like are you pulling a quarter from behind Hilmar's ear or what?
---
if you say that enough times it becomes true right?
---
Oh this is exactly what they intended for them. Only way to really capitalize on them is for us to do farm like that why do you think it hasn't been nerfed since it's inception.
---
who are the mighty beans and why did you evict them
---
That's not reasonable.
---
join all-out
---
Its ok guys, much like enron or worldcom, they're going to change their player reporting stats so we don't know that things are bad.
---
its just funny they decide the really big expensive ships were too powerful so they countered by making one of the smallest cheapest T2 ships you can get the ultimate gank tool and somehow they don't seem to understand that's not going to actually solve anything, it will just create a different problem.
---
And you got diagnosed with a case of backstabber.
---
Talking to people who just want to be asshats isn't anyone's idea of fun, and he doesn't have to do it.
---
You mean having less than 19k people in US prime time on a week end is a bad sign?
---
Fuck off retard
---
a minority of players participate in them. this is a pie in the sky post.
---
Uh, context?
---
who needs olmeca to listen to them? he'll push his own agenda regardless of what you say to him.
---
we have reached the "morale posting on someones behalf" stage
---
safelogging on a tether, good times.
---
Couple this with the eventual bigger universe and this will be really cool.
---
No u
---
He's not my representative.
---
That's your opinion.
---
oh shit, on who's behalf?
---
TownsFolk   not Townsend........
---
ah yes a proletariat revolution. overthrow the space  bourgeoisie.
---
Yea, what can we do then? Is there then a way to petition ccp if this becomes a problem?
---
You're honestly just some moron sperging out on reddit, with some insanely bad ideas formed through cherrypicking stats to suit your rants.
---
Ahb will edit
---
Strictly from economics standpoint this is wrong. Economic collapse happens due to market intervention having unintended consequences, loss of confidence in certain assets like housing bubble popping when it became clear that people cant repay cheap loans, hyperinflation but not "loss in demand and supply" - those are purely lag measures.
---
Even if sellers have a monopoly on a product, they are still limited by the maximum amount a buyer can pay. So if "prices will be set so high no one could afford it", then naturally these prices would drop to a level that the customer can afford, otherwise the seller wont sell anything. If margins drop to the point where everything becomes unprofitable as a result of this, people would simply migrate to another activity or quit. That leads to changes in demand and supply, not the other way round.
---
Yea true, I went a bit hard on that Representative thing, sounded funny as hell when I wrote it though.
---
disregard him as a point of contact.
---
Most wormhole ratting is in bearholes once a week. No need for chain to be rolled. The exceptions are more than you'll hear on reddit but less than you'd expect. 
---
So, I'll stand by my statement of you not understanding how wormhole space (not holes but the region of space) works.
---
What this would affect is PvP and the logistics of wormholes. No rage rolling for content, no rolling because you're connected to nothing, no rolling off hostiles during evictions, no rolling for better HS connections.
---
None of this is a super serious problem for Low Class wormholes but would possibly force all the High Class to move ruining what few capital fights we actually get. The C5 highway is a hell of a thing and sometimes has few exits.
---
Both should be done. Both can be done.
---
Dont worry man, CCP said they will be bringing in more players soon. I have no idea from where or the plan to retain them but then again, us lowly mortals wouldnt understand grand cosmic plans either way.
---
Thanks for the warning.
---
Yea, but that won't solve the problem of him then "acting on our behalf" if we have a CSM representative we deem has "Gone rogue" what's the tools at the players disposal?
---
From Facebook to Reddit.
---
The SJW invasion's end is not in sight.
---
IMO we should treat all csm with respect and dignity. They are democratically elected and communually represent the players and have a positive effect on the game development. This level of childish, hostile, and downright distasteful behaviour is a disservice to the eve online community and their votes and reduced the credibility of the csm as an institution.
---
If you are all still so butthurt over the blackout just do what i did and move out of null. Nobody is forcing you to be unhappy. Adapt and vent your frustration elsewere.
---
tldr grow up
---
Probably couldnt harm the game anymore
---
Holy fucking shit, Pot 😂😂😂
---
 all i did was take the modules, and some hulls from the forts. i had nothing to do with inner hell showing up. all i wanted to do was participate in helping lead the corp. after being constantly harassed by sharo, and then my suggestions being ignored or brushed aside. and seeing simple to solve problems pile up, and the manipulating, and excuses. It was just a bit much. so i wanted to get some attention i really didnt want to harm the members im sorry for dead beans 📷
---
I would love these. These systems could get really wild and interesting.
---
I moved to r/eve to give olmeca shit. Don't like it? Adapt and vent your frustration elsewhere
---
Lol, facebook too? 
---
Dunno, the toxicity is actually more trying than ccp's game development decisions for me atm
---
Id say shut up hilmar again but youd probably bitch out and try to get me banned from here again lmao
---
I'd probably save it until the upcoming cyno changes, and dump it shortly thereafter since I imagine that will drastically reduce the amount of nullsec mining (at least for a short while).
---
no the fuck it does not... why you talking out your ass
---
Hahaha, that's a good one, fukin got my upvote
---
Very nice. What system was this in?
---
Ooooooh NullBears salt. So good. How dare you challenge the goddamn War Chief!?!
---
I agree but back in the middle ages when this practice began up until the late 17th century, It was essential as basic hygiene was not practiced. Unfortunately carrying around some strong smelling flowers wasn't going to actually keep your dick clean. Not to mention I bet a lot of these nerds don't practice basic hygiene.
---
I approve it.
---
The guy that will likely never join any Corp of worth ever again after selling out friends of years for months worth of isk, provided he doesnt get banned for knowingly taking RMT isk as payment.
---
Lmao you got banned? Wtf i love mods?
---
Aw man the childishness is lulzy at this point. Like I said, some insults are actually really creative. 
---
But at the end, what might make me unsub is the community attempting to take the 1st place salt medal from LoL
---
Im still here aren't I?
---
How dare you suggest that a game without any real expansions for god knows how long will stagnate?
---
You truly have no self awareness do you? Lmao
---
L.M.F.A.O if that ain’t the truest stereotype I’ve ever heard.
---
Take my upvote
---
Imagine a game where people fight to the last man, because they stand to lose everything if they don't win...
---
I'd pay money for such a game.
---
Nobody, and for no reason.
---
I know this will achieve nothing but bit feels so good.
---
&gt;banned from here again
---
This quite literally means you were banned previously dipshit. It's no wonder Goons think the game is balanced, they have to compensate for every human that somehow manage to dodge the coat hanger but achieve literally nothing else of note.
---
Odd how something this year seems to have deflated that.
---
Having fun following me about?
---
'Game is losing population since January'
---
'Players complain about game issues'
---
'CCP fixes issues' 
---
'Players complain about CCP killing the game'
---
Uhhh no? Fine by me. 
---
Wormholer btw
---
just remove gate guns period, game's now better
---
lsbtw
---
Ironic
---
Who doesnt have an issue with citadel mechanics? You do realise its us that actually have to kill them right? 
---
And balance is one thing, but just breaking things isnt balance.
---
Why did goons opt out to never use them when pl literally moved to goon staging to try and fight?  
---
same reason.
---
  
---
But hey, it's clear You're here to just post memes/ bullshit like BBTB
---
That was either me, grabbing a bill from the Beans after I left because of how shit they were, or Apex, who stole that bill right back from me for the Beans. Unless Sharon stole from Odin's and I didn't hear about it.         
---
Good times.
---
Yeah null people don't truly understand.
---
It's quite the experience
---
Nice.
---
Notice how it’s only goons salty ITT
---
Well, you sure showed him.
---
I'm genuinely curious what did CCP fix?
---
Ummm none of these choas era changes have affected that, it's quite literally that after UALX and whatever fight was up north with goons and NC noone is willing to commit their whole super fleet to a big fight again because blue balls
---
Didn't Sharon get kicked and join NOVAC or Odin's or some shit?
---
brawl me in a bomber coward
---
Salt is a good proservitive yo.
---
It's also mine, and it's correct.  
---
No timer and meant to be scooped when you're not actively playing doesn't fit in with the overall design for upwell structures at all.  
---
How about if we just leave local off, instead of making some weird design that doesn't fit with anything else? Come up with some other way to get intel on who is in the system than a "magical chat system" that you can't opt out of in supposedly lawless space.  
---
Myself, I really like the idea of a whole new sensor system with active pinging sensors and passive listening sensors, with distance, local topography of the system and stealth characteristics of ships coming into play. Something that players have to interact with in order to use effectively.  
---
We really think too small sometimes - Eve really has a lot of potential if we think outside of what already exists.
---
What have CCP fixed? All I see is them making more game breaking mistakes like they have for the past few years
---
Actually funniest thing I’ve ever seen on twitch. I literally said this exact thing during a TIS show once.
---
Said “man this is just a bunch of grown men jerking each other off on the internet.” 
---
They permabanned me from their chat lmfao.
---
Man we're going overboard xD I'm gonna try as much eve as possible before we ruin it
---
Beans are an entry-level C5 group who were beginning to try and build themselves into a real wspace entity. They were evicted because one of their directors approached Inner Hell and offered to unfit all structures in the hole for 40bil. Inner Hell love to fly 10mn Lokis and Nightmares. Both doctrines perform very poorly on a fort grid in a Pulsar, and both were used to great effect here because the main fort wasn't fit.
---
Seeing as these are more questions for yourself that is incorrect :P .
---
You can only boosh 5x your mass. =)
---
Olmecas??
---
Wow.  That is amazing.  Verbose.  I don't care for your opinion either.
---
Maybe he shouldn't be such a massive autist that's trying to push his agenda to only benefit his play style.
---
Absentee... Seriously?
---
Clearly the petitioner has exactly zero exposure to CEOs in RL. Even by in-game CEO standards, Hilmar would not qualify as absentee.
---
Best possible score of 2.5/10, assuming this is ironic bait.
---
On top of 6 months of turbo krabbing because of nips so everyone and their mums dog has a titan but can't use it because ohno we don't want someone to put up a reddit post of our titan loss (this is something a member in a legacy alliance who wanted to fool around with his titan was actually told...)
---
The actual reason for the slump, and why there was less of a slump last year (almost every fight during the actual test v frat / goons v nc war had supers in full use, now they're only used if FC is 100% sure they won't be shot at
---
It’s been ruined for a very long time
---
There are other styles that can be applied though. Something simpler would be to have all locals on a single clock. Every 30s it scans everything and puts it up in chat. Sure, one wont be able to speed things up with a structure, but it could give way to interesting abuse by fleets. Such as entering a system just after the last scan, thus having the advantage of being hidden in the next system for whatever the duration is. Imagine bridging in huge fleets using that ^^
---
I gotta know how this is on Olmecas behalf, I think I wrote this to get people to argue against him more effectively. Or is there a secret curse language I have not been taught?
---
I had to unsubscribe two accounts because of real life time issues.
---
&gt; Well the same was said about hard knocks...
---
by retarded mongoloids sure.
---
this is such a nice post, don't ruin it now :dagger:
---
You weren't wrong.
---
More like you are what is left of eve when they:
---
- Give docking to supercaps
---
- Bring back aoe dd with bosons
---
- Give haws to caps
---
- Keep buffing rorqs to make them into fighting caps
---
- More and more crap dedicated only to cap powerhousing
---
TIS as a discord channel is actually better than many other discords. They moderate the zealous null linemembers at some point.
---
As a comparison, I can't talk in the public side of the CSM discord because there is no moderation lol.
---
You should petition yourself to stop posting.
---
The article is very useful to learn about game mechanics.
---
SO much of it would be nice.  But which of them could be done with less investment in coding?  Because I don't think they will do anything "hard" right now.  
---
Polarized guns for HAW dreads would be easy fiddling with stats, for example.  But change of security status with NPC ratting sounds like it would need some major low level coding of the game.
---
&gt; or just be fully countered by any group fitted with speed or thats simply smaller?
---
welcome to every weapons system in the game excep rapid jesus missiles, not our fault application is too hard a concept to grasp

ccp should probably work on marketing the game and get more people to play it, before they start new grand ideas like this.

stop starting up failed projects every two years and put the money into marketing/advertising...

&gt;g game balance with some zealous null linemembers. They take the ad hominem route.\] Until the line "if ad hominems will keep ha
---
Olmeca, you are the worst. You know you are literally known for your whining and thinking everyone is out to get you... like the time you accused r/eve moderators of banning you at the behest of goons.
---
This is the kinda answers we need, this is actually an argument against him.
---
For the amount of shit posting u do in this thread, you are surprisingly clueless
---
No stargates. U have to find using wormholes. Once found though  u can cyno in anything that can go 7ly or more
---
I was told he'd been kicked and he showed up in a NOVAC fleet that failed to gank my Rorqual. So I think I have a clue or two here.
---
So, what’s funny about all the salt is lower tier guys like me don’t even know what the issues are. Not because we’re not paying attention but because we haven’t even gotten to that stage of the game and I for one am still enjoying what I can do now. So, while yes I can appreciate that watching years of hard work and effort be made null and void by the sweeping hand of god, I don’t know that they players who are making enough isk to PLEX 20 accounts are the ones CCP should be the most worried about. Because those same players will make newbies unsub after a couple days because they lost their 5 ship to a gank and have to go PLEX in order to get another one. CCP should definitely be considering how to get more new blood into the game and to go omega and STAY. It’ll take them years or an investment of RL money to PLEX to the level of multi titan owners with 15 constellations in their control. Years of new subs is a good thing.
---
that and the incident with BL titans earlier this year(?)

still useful for driveby titans(all 3 of them) for shedding hics i guess?

It's a feature now.

Get gud.

The bomb only do damage if the bomber is still alive...

How is giving free intel to the most lucrative space in eve beneficial what so ever? The game needs the black out. Yes, it’s became more exciting and pvp is better than ever. It’s forcing players to pvp, its what makes eve a hardcore MMO and separates it from games like WoW. It’s a hardcore MMO with a steep learning curve that should only get steeper towards veterans. If that’s not you’re or anyone else play style then you’re playing the wrong game (words from CCP Falcon). That being said, this isn’t negotiable and no to a middle ground. You want to live in null, you’re going to get appropriate isk vs rewards. 
---
Plex prices dropped
---
RMTing has significantly gone down
---
Botting has dropped
---
Stagnation has dropped
---
Small gang pvp has drastically gone up
---
Nothing but good has come from these updates. Best of all, it’s finally forcing players to fight and risk their ships for that tender, juicy, dank loot. Be prepared to fight for it like the good ole days.
---
It really isn't though.
---
Players have loads of things they can do right from the get go. You have this false idea that everyone had to make an account and then do nothing for a long time.
---
Take it easy.
---
It was meant at a joke, god dammit CCP....
---
Is karkur still with CCP? Is the QOL thread still monitored?

Check it out! The video report of the battle!

CCP has thrown the kitchen sink at login numbers this summer (SP rewards) and it's still down substantially.

One can hope CCP is doing a stellar job with bots, but we know they just grow back like cancer after each ban.

so.. now getting hunted by IH ?
---
It's what happens when only a couple of systems can sustain a large number of people's isk making.
---
For everyone who isn't competing the AT doesn't even register.
---
Yay CCP are gonna give an already rich group another bunch of 100bil hulls. Horray. 
---
Can you feel the excitement?  No ?? Well me neither.
---
Most people watch the steam for 20-30 min and that is their entire involvement in the event.
---
The level of toxicity is astounding. If Eve dies, it will be by the hand of the players.
---
Black and the new cyno changes for 1.
---
Amongst other QOL changes too.
---
&gt; You guys probably want Olmeca to listen to you right?
---
They don't. That's not the point.
---
They don't want the recent changes, they know I am one of the prominent defenders of those, and are turning up the hate campaign prior to the CSM summit which is very important for the changes.
---
He brings up some great points, specifically about asymmetrical CSM representation. He supports a mindset, he want's to keep the game unique, he's not about "I'm going to represent my coalition on the CSM". Too many CSM candidates are just about representing their coalition, and that's terrible for the game.
---
I have a lot of respect for Olmeca tbh.
---
Gate crashing has never been a problem for a competent camp.
---
Bro that's what I'm starting to think. Just look at this entire subreddit. Just salt. 
---
Wait, instead of quitting eve, should. I quit reddit?
---
So you choose to ignore valid opinions because they are different than your own.  Do you know what that makes you?  A bigot.
---
I'm not a krab and I don't even rat but using your position in CSM to only benefit you and your friends play style is the reason people don't like you.
---
We have been telling him for a very long time why his ideas are shit.  He refuses to listen to anyone that doesn't suck his tiny cock.
---
&gt; to only benefit you and your friends play styl
---
I lost my 8b/hr excav booshing to blackout. Tell me more.
---
PS: Thanks for portraying everyone happy with cyno changes and blackout as "my friends". I didn't know I had that many.
---
No. HAW Dreads being polarized would make them basically useless. Maybe they need a nerf but removing their resists removes any reason to ever use them. Aside from this destroying the solo HAW dreadnought pvp niche, this also makes wormhole ratting in higher class wormholes way harder and more annoying, because those can really only be done with a HAW dreadnought or several battleships.
---
There are none
---
As long as he logs in to whatever they hold the meetings in, he will keep his job unless he breaks the ToS or NDA.
---
So people are zealous just because they don't agree with you or what to play the game the same way as you?
---
The people's CSM.
---
You better give it back dude. They banned me for less.
---
I ran my campaign on not being your representative.
---
But perhaps you're too unfamiliar with the notion of a campaign as it's more than getting some from a tribally voting ballot and buying the rest for ISK.
---
Mynxee, you effing rock
---
DON'T FIT A CARGO SCANNER. Waste of fitting space.
---
Nullsec is a larger population of capsuleers, but empire has WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY more people and way more GDP.
---
Remember also that nullsec eats up Concords funds from bounties.
---
Spool many people dont understand this, both gamers and game developers. This is why I cringe everytime someone says the phrase "conflict drivers".  You cant drive people to conflict , you can only try to understand why conflict happens and why, as time goes on, people tend to move away from conflict towards cooperation ( or at least, exploitation).
---
Humans aren't naturally quaralsome ( if we were, there would be less need to put soldiers through recruit training), humans are opportunistic. This is why after ccp tried to drive conflict with moons, a thing called OTEC came about.
---
Given enough time, humans will.modify the environment to make it more comfortable. This is why I live in a city that was wilderness 200 years ago. 
---
People bring those human behaviors into the game with them. Which is why we are sitting here talking about a game that has all manner of guns and ways to kill each other and we're asking "how can we make people fight"...
---
And they pay bounties out.
---
Which is more?
---
Shitty advice. Don't waste fitting space on a cargo scanner. It's also a waste of time. Hack then all. Clear the site. Don't be a douchebag.
---
Ah just like the nullbloc members.
---
Where do rat bounties come from?
---
Those already exist though
---
This is a very workable wishlist but I wish devtime wasn't an issue. I only have one point of disagreement.
---
&gt; Observatories 
---
Eve needs more local stability in less condense/inhabited areas, and less local stability in condense areas with more inhabitants. Tying local to infrastructure is categorically a bad idea. Settling in a space should have perks but local shouldn't be one of them. Strong local in weak places and weak local in strong places can be one of the very rare anti-Malcanis mechanics Eve can have.
---
you're assuming there's good faith involved in those screeching there against him, there isn't
---
No I'm asking you these questions, because you're the pedophile bud.  Like this whole "you're talking to yourself" works great for the 8 year olds you're dating but I'm pretty sure most adults just look at you funny when you try silly shit like that.
---
Where do you work?  I feel like at this point its my actual duty to start notifying people at your work and shit of your habits.
---
And every thread.
---
i mean, tbh, i haven't logged in in a couple months. hell, i even forgot about the sp rewards. but it's mostly cause the game has gotten boring AF.
---
No. Observatories would just provide a minor intel convenience. Theres no reason you cant set up somewhere and not use an observatory. If they had actual timers they’d basically be free because nobody would waste time organizing a structure bash just to delay the intel gathering via local of your enemy slightly worse.
---
You'd think at least 1 person defending the 10 man gangs and whalers as opposed to everyone defending the null linemember is good lol.
---
People are zealous because they do ad hominems during balance discussions. Like what you are doing rn :)
---
As opposed to everyone else pushing their agenda to only benefit their playstyle?
---
Olmeca had a campaign, and people voted for that campaign.
---
Enough so that he got elected.
---
Why do you then act as if he is the only one that wants what he stands for?
---
If he showed up in a NOVAC fleet to try and gank your rorq, sounds like you know where he is? You're either trying to "huehue who is he with so irrelevant idk even huehue" or you asked seriously and then tried to say you have a clue. Either one makes you a fucking moron tho.
---
Concord pays the players to kill those and we kill them? What does this have to do with providing gate services and the payment of sov bills?
---
Yes... what's your point? What strategy do you think will magically erase a flight of bombers in 12 seconds flat?
---
I can think of several ways to counter bombers during a fight, but none that can be applied to this situation in a way that will save those drones. And, perhaps more relevantly, all of them would require a dozen people to be absolutely glued to their screens, 110% alert and ready, for the entire time the Rorqual is out there mining. Which is just not realistic. In any shape or form.
---
What does that have to do with what we pay for Sov? The rat bounties are exactly that, a bounty set by concord on that pirate faction.
---
This is a dumb way to look at politics.
---
He was elected by players for his campaign. How is then following his campaign only benefitting him? Clearly enough people liked that platform to be elected.
---
He represents those that voted for him.
---
For a decent part of the eviction they were using NOVAC comms as theirs was struggling to hold up, it was an... *interesting* experience.
---
tbqh gigx should have finished the job
---
No, I'm responding to the guy who complained about having to deal with how annoying he was by asking if Sharo hadn't left Beans. Surely given that Sharo left Beans the guy I'm responding to wouldn't have had to deal with him being annoying.
---
Totally agree. CCP might be in that situation where they need to fire some of their customers and encourage them to move on. Not convinced these long term, hardcore players are best for CCPs future.
---
So why do you keep asking yourself questions...its really odd man.
---
Still better. Then to highsec I go finding things to do. I've done it before. I'll take the game again with 10k real people (yeah yeah alts n shit) rather than 40k bots and 10k people.   Any day of the fucking week.
---
If Concord is paying more money out to sov than they are collecting, then they have a net deficit.
---
Where do you expect them to pay for services when they are losing money?
---
And if he were to look it up, he would find articles that would explain exactly what he is asking for here, but written by people well versed in Eve markets, not some random schlep that thinks he can write.
---
Yes, if you spend $2000 on food, and earn $1500 at work, how do you afford helium 3?
---
Why don't you all just leave and delete your accounts already? The game is over for you, move on.
---
Skill plan updating
---
About point 2: It makes sense. Either a fraction of it drops cuz nullsec or its secretly hauled by CCP Hauler Service™️ but some of the freighters got ganked lol
---
No he didn't.
---
At some point it's not about CCP, stop fucking blaming them for everything. 
---
80% of null is blued up. That's why there are no big headline making fights, unless someone makes a mistake, there won't be any.
---
We're in Serenity.
---
Now include the summer prior
---
But then why was June higher than before blackout?
---
Er...is there a Loki in this pic that I’m not seeing or...?
---
Considering how much less PVE is happening and how much less bots are online this is pretty good.
---
... hence forth known as the Pando nerf.
---
Maybe we should all quit reddit. And the carebears should quit eve.
---
I have not listened to this interview yet, but if it is as described, it is reprehensible IMO.
---
Those sorts of insults say more about those talking rather than their target. 
---
As far as how _we_ can communicate to CCP what I will say is the CSM has never been the only or even the best conduit to CCP. If you have well-formed feedback, the forums, Twitter, Reddit, various Discords, etc. exist. 
---
The biggest problem I see is often people confuse CCP making a different assessment as them as not listening. Often a developer will hear a players feedback and take that as a statement on their experience. Now, CCP is a game company, and game companies are about creating an experience, so the feedback is invaluable, even if the suggestion itself is rubbish.
---
Are you telling me that all of the null-bloc CSM members haven't done the same?
---
all-out
---
Great statement, have my updoot.
---
\^\^\^ Karmafleet is recruiting.
---
Jump bridges arent star gates.
---
Putting the Wormholer tag on doesn't make you a better play bro.
---
I try think the best of people. I assume that people who play this game loves this game, they just might have some difficulties expressing their worry.
---
If that's not the case then I think I'm gonna think of finding a way to block r/eve
---
**Asset safety** should everywhere (except wh) work like the old 0.0 stations.
---
If your structure is killed you still keep your stuff, but lose access.
---
Only way to get it back is, access to another station/structure IN SYSTEM you can move it to, plus a one week timer, plus paying 5%(not 0.5%) asset value penalty.
---
Means if you loose a struktur in high/low/npc 0.0 you move your stuff to a public/npc station in the same system.
---
If you lose it in sov 0.0 you have to set up a new structure and fight to get your assets back, or wait years for a chance to get it back.
---
**Low Power** structure lose tether, all shield hp, damage cap, and all timers like an oversized InterBus POCO aka you can kill them in one attack.
---
If you are unable to fuel your structure, or tell someone to do so, you dont deserve the structure.
---
I agree with your points concerning less pve action.
---
I would get behind us paying the jove to maintain out sov. Concord doesnt do much for us. Sure they give bounties but let's face it ccp is trying to get rid of ratting as a means of income. So it makes sense for Concord to no longer be the ones in control. I want a rebellion against Concord. Tahtsbwhat I wanna see.  Concord has way too much power. And not enough oversight.
---
For once I agree with you.
---
If you think ccp isnt going to find a way to remove bounties in null next you are living in a. Dream land. Ccp is trying to kill the pve gameplay in null. Only a matter of time before ded the last thing Concord does for us goes away.
---
Probably the money they take in from the empires. The players aren't asking concord to assist in the removal of pirates from their space. It is the Empires and concord who want the capsuleers to reign in the pirate factions.
---
I'm sure there's something that fits this criteria on the Goon forums, check the "New Player FAQ"
---
It's a minmatar gate, can be found in minmatar space. Probably some other places too, not sure where else though
---
That's an interesting point to bring up, being that the CSM isn't the only way to reach CCP.
---
The recent environment around here has made that idea become lost in the noise. I think Ill start promoting that somewhat important factor, thanks o7
---
20-30? Why so many
---
He said fixed there Einstein.
---
Gotta get our player count up somehow
---
That's a wrong answer to ask.
---
Who would you pick: a girl with huge unkempt looking labia or tiny innies? The answer is the question is wrong. There are tons of other things to consider when picking a partner even when it comes to casual hookups. Circumcised or intact penis is just as important as hair color. Which means barely anyone cares.
---
You should be looking at studies like this instead https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21672947
---
&gt;CONCLUSIONS:
---
&gt;Circumcision was associated with frequent orgasm difficulties in Danish men and with a range of frequent sexual difficulties in women, notably orgasm difficulties, dyspareunia and a sense of incomplete sexual needs fulfilment.
---
Totally ;)
---
And it sucks when they do it to, CSM should be trying to benefit the over all health of the game and not just what's gonna help them.
---
That’d be terrible. Implementing this means that anyone who jumps through and lands in a gatecamp with a bubble has no counter-play options if they cant take on the entire camp themselves, which almost no ship (except for capitals, battleships, and high DPS high tank battlecruisers) can do against even a small camp. This means that getting a small gang together and deploying a bubble becomes an effective “I win” button because your target can’t escape and has to fight you or watch as they themselves die, powerless to do anything. Imagine being a victim of that. In addition this would also get rid of aggro games which can be very fun.
---
Aw hell, my life has been a lie!
---
Its really odd how much the little kids rub off on you while you're rubbing one off to them, your personality is really child like, its like the more you've fucked one the less able you are to hold an adult conversation without using one of their little idioms.
---
Stupidest thing I’ve ever seen on this post
---
I hope you guys rally back. Beans have been some of the most active wh groups out there. 
---
Go kick inner hell's butt!
---
We are having the same conversation in two threads. Short version empires pay concord to remove pirates. Lets continue in the other thread.
---
Lol production is really not fine.... In fact it's out of control.... The fact that I can cook 9+ titans at the same time in the same structure is a HUGE problem that has accelerated the proliferation that has landed us where we are today.
---
I'm fine with carebears
---
UNLESS THEY SHOW BOT ASPIRANT BEHAVIOUR &gt;:C
---
Holy S, this is awesome. Make it so CCP.
---
What if I told you that the chat server constantly breaking is the reason for the blackout. What if I also told you the September changes mean no more big fleet fights.
---
doesn't CCP marketing department love beating their dick to shit like this?
---
In fact we are!  Just not him.
---
Sure, so the Empires are worth far far far far far far far more money.
---
dw they're still in amamake and places circlejerking over their (frigate) kill count.
---
Yes, those are fixing issues in the games design.
---
What is the difference?
---
In game play terms?
---
Can your next video has Russian dubstep kthx
---
EVE has always required careful planning to protect your home, defend your allies and move assets through space. CCP should change that core element for people who are called away from the game? Life's not fair.
---
I read an interesting quote " Most r/eve warriors would eat their own shit for a year if it meant  Olmeca  has to only smell it in passing"
---
well that's a well thought out response, let me know when you can grasp sarcasm...or not :D
---
I stopped logging in and let my alts lapse. Not as a “fuck ccp”, but because most of what I could do during my game time was mine  not many fleets I can boing between 9&amp;11.
---
I'm talking about Jump Gates, not normal Star Gates. If your jump bridge is being camped and you can't clear that, then you deserve to be camped. And no, you can't deploy an anchorable bubble on jump gates because a citadel can kill them.
---
Oh, nvm then
---
Maybe his play style is mine to. So he is advocating for more than just himself. 
---
Just cause I dont wanna pussy up in the null blocks for free farming online doesn't  make my view less valid.
---
Don't worry, I'm getting flooded with comments because people are too fucking dumb to understand exactly what I typed.
---
Yeah I just hit 100mil too. Still personally meaningful. It's a feeling the injectorbros will never understand or experience.
---
Well then if that's the case and he wont listen , why not stfu already ? The only reason to keep talking to the deaf is if you like the sounds of your own voice.
---
Thanks for the advice.
---
I'm not sure why the downvotes. This sub is more crabby and butthurt than I remember it being.
---
Please, bob, tell me this is bait.
---
Yeah, that was one of the things I *really* didn't like about the tutorial. I'd followed EvE Online for nearly a decade by the point I started, I knew what I was getting into, but the fact that the tutorial didn't emphasize this at all was pretty jarring. I think that's one of the things that needs to be fixed.
---
Sure, but in the end we pay Concord for a set of services and they don't provide those services any more. So stop charging us for it then.
---
Isn't that really eve in a nutshell though, a small group of autistic players  In coalitions  trying to push their agenda to only benefit their play style. Like that's everyone on the CSM right if we can be real about it.

They didn't earned it! We legged the monster grind for years to reach this milestone, and feels good xD
---
You being against him is truly a ringing endorsement. The game is better off without you, Judge.
---
Allegedly there was some ddossing
---
&gt; It really isn't though.
---
Skills more than double your DPS.  You cannot deny that that is an enormous factor in engagements and claim to be at all reasonable, and that's just one part of the role they play.  It takes no effort, ability, or risk to get those skills, all it takes is you letting your account sit idle for long enough.  You are entirely, 100% incorrect.
---
&gt; You have this false idea that everyone had to make an account and then do nothing for a long time.
---
I never once said or implied this or anything analogous to this.  I'd explain it again but you've already established that you are not in any way reasonable.
---
its what happens when you encourage it by tilting the game in favor of gankers so hard the krabs all huddle together.
---
The pay is for recognition of the territorial claim.
---
Is Concord no longer recognizing those claims?
---
/u/ccp_falcon
---
Dude just wait until October when he either gets his bonus or not and leaves.
---
Certainly, but it was also something like 10x the number of titans (never mind supercarriers) lost in any single engagement prior.  (But also, tbf, about two or three months worth of cowboy titan losses, even at that time...)
---
Just harden up, adapt or die. Why not counter drop?
---
Spartan why did you self destruct six caps on day of armor timers
---
So then what is the point?
---
People have loads of things to do.
---
Nobody jumps into Skyrim thinking they should have all the abilities.
---
Nobody is jumping into eve thinking they can beat players that have been playing longer.
---
I don't want to make any unfounded accusations :)
---
&gt; Blackout ends but local is forever changed. The local counter is back but the system takes up to 5 minutes to recognize who is in system (30 seconds per -0.1 security level).
---
Because I'm sympathetic to the engineers, I'm inclined to ask whether "system updates every X seconds/minutes, and you don't know where in that cycle you are" would be acceptable here.
---
Nah don’t make it a module but do add the mechanic that it needs fuel. I Like the drifter idea.
---
Then as I said let players provide the service for gates. If it is supposed to be lawless why are we beholden to Concords rules? And what do those territory claims give players anyways?
---
You can still go fuck yourself Judge.
---
And making a small amount of space able to sustain to many people
---
Ah yeah this would be a good idea because then I could sneak up on ratters and have the upper hand. Would love that
---
looks like he got shot
---
But you only do that because there's demand for it. People want those titans, and are willing to work for it. 
---
If you made it one titan per Sotiyo, then you and all the other industry people would adapt by having nine Sotiyos. You would do this because people want titans.
---
Just stay docked till they start bashing ez
---
He has apologized to me, so that's resolved as far as I'm concerned. 
---
I do wish somebody had posted something like this for me when the wormhole guys were going insane. :)
---
Just move to a C5 with Rorqs to get that dank 8B/hr back 5head
---
He took more damage then he had hp
---
&gt;The area of space would be devoid of any permanent structures so no citadels and no pos as they would be destroyed by the environment they are in.
---
This was basically the original intention of wormholes. The devs have said players weren't intended to live there.
---
Fascinating idea.
---
fc how do I create a dummy alliance for the at
---
Their name in the upper left.
---
How are you beholden to Concords rules?
---
Last I checked shooting people.doesnt give you negative sec.
---
Most of us don't dare comment. In null everyone is is salty atm except a tiny minority who always is present in this forums.
---
You don't seem to understand the point of elections.
---
What if a cyno drops... oh wait... that's right.
---
That's what they do.  I never, not once, saw anybody advocating solely for something that would benefit their members at the expense of the game.  That's not the point of the CSM, and somebody arguing that position would be instantly tuned out by CCP for obvious reasons.
---
I both agree and disagree with you here.
---
Here's where I disagree: Humans *are*, to a certain extent, naturally quarrelsome, or at least greedy, but... acting on it too much is a great way to lose it all, too.  Additionally, it turns out that you can achieve more if you work together with people towards a common goal.  This is why societies have in-groups and out-groups.
---
Here's where I agree: Against a relatively static background, people will find the most profitable way for themselves.  Without destabilizing factors, it is optimal to find how much space you can control and consolidate your power there.  Recently, what we've been seeing is that there is more space than the large groups that want to put down roots feel the need to control, but the small groups that want to do so aren't strong enough to hold up in the face of the nomads who have the power to control more territory but don't have a desire to do the empire-building thing.  So, in the end, the leaders of the large blocs continue to need to keep their line members entertained, but they don't actually have a need to *move*... so there's no effort to capture different territory.
---
That's the thing doctrines are made to counter other doctrines, if fighters are a big issue then get some assault frigs to deal with them, if your fleets are getting deleted by hounds then get some jackdaw's with defender missiles or use command destroyers to boosh away from bs. What I'm basically trying to say is that there are mannnny counters in this game and if what you're doing isnt working then maybe take a step back and modify your strategy, Ive seen fleets chew through fighters before so thats not a major issue. Just adapt, if they changed everything based off someone just not liking it wouldnt really go to well for the game. 1 group of people would say hey we dont like that they can do X, they change it to make them happy, then group 2 would simply say hey that doctrine ship they use is too strong, so they nerf it. leaves back to where you started. if you adapt your play, your going to have a good time lol
---
You wait until the next CSM.
---
Passive regen, that rattler can do lvl 4s like a breeze...must have been afk for 40min...
---
I see you’re a “I am elite because I only ever fly subcaps. Adapt or die. No, not me. You adapt. And die. I win.”
---
What good ole days? The good ole days where caps were even more op?
---
I think it's a reasonable nerf, but ok.
---
“I want to roam around undetected, preferably cloaked, through somebody elses space, because I dislike risk”
---
great shoot nice
---
Olmeca is complaining that nobody (in null, at least) uses excavators because they're afraid of driveby bombing for killmails, which also elmiminated the method of moving them several hundred km away and scooping them to cargo.  That's the 8B/h that disappeared, not the mining.
---
Got DD'd
---
haahhaahahahah no way
---
His playstyle of what, going into nullsec and incurring risk?
---
Good you guys are having fun o/
---
Starving dreks dont have dd
---
I know, my comment was a joke, his old booshing Excav robberies were always interesting.
---
Sales taxes are forced upon players, one can safely assume they are paid to some NPC corporation and we have to follow those rules. We pay fees on ihubs which don't provide our name but provide us with the ability to do things, why do we have to pay concord for those?
---
it’s a mad world, b
---
Isn't that what every bloc member on the CSM has been doing *since forever*?
---
Your playstyle is why the game is stagnant and there are no wars going on.
---
In fairness, that's CCP's fault more than anything else, designing so many "rich get richer" mechanics that the first entity through the door would inevitably snowball uncontrollably and slam the door on anyone else trying to follow. But that's the hand we've been dealt, and we need to work within its parameters.
---
Well there you go. Dust off the ol Archon
---
Afaik, npc KMs only show one enemy (apart from drifters? Maybe), so this is most likely someone trying to farm a Trig invasion and getting rekted
---
Thought he was hardcore but fails big time lol
---
eev is ded
---
More like “dock this weak pve shit and get some real guns so I can personally get that fucker out of my space or die trying”
---
I think 24hr timer where it's down for that duration works fine, a good meet in the middle, it's a bit of a farce to expect the 1 dude online to undock to save it, I'm all for instant content generation but at the same time that's too powerful for random roaming gangs, I've seen sotiyos anchoring in autz be deleted by a gang purely because provi didn't want to help this guy who got unlucky with a gang stumbling past as it was 20min from anchor, they could have formed something to defend against a small kitchen sink and a handful of carriers, but didn't, I see the same happening for a structure with no ref timer
---
&gt;He represents those that voted for him.
---
He **is** representing those that voted for him. He hasn't done a big post election backflip on his position. He's doing the shit that **he said he would**. 
---
And it's glorious.
---
&gt;He was elected by players for his campaign.
---
LOL he was elected because of his anti-goon reputation. He was a unifying face the likes of which all the sufferers of GRRR goon syndrome could get behind.
---
&gt;If you have well-formed feedback, the forums, Twitter, Reddit, various Discords, etc. exist.
---
And they will ignore it and do as they please just like they always have.
---
No just route it once it will continue to route
---
Basically you are building a surplus and will continue to route whe the cycle is complete. Build more factories
---
Triglavian npcs have the same ramping mechanic as the regular triglavian ships. if you were to leave a dangerous liminal drekavac alive you could be in for a world of hurt.

Looks to me like the ship was not on his overview and he could not figure out what was killing him

Gezz they need to figure out how to fix this
---
Fix what :)

Flair checks out

I’m all for making pve less spread out, more bang for your buck, however people will find ways to pve 24/7 with the newfound loot/isk/olmeca cum bonus.
---
Being able to play 20-30 accounts. 3-5 seems ok but 20? We need players not afkers
---
Is it not already risky then? Wait are you seriously saying that you don’t get into trouble when buying 10+bil of some third party?
---
it’s zkillboard and the fear of losing ships, nothing more or less
---
My playstyle is borderline psychotic.  I will fight against all but the MOST unwinnable odds win everything i haVe
---
The “elite” pvp consider me stupid and horrible as a player because of that, so i promise you
---
It isn’t my playstyle.  It’s yours and other zkill fearing kill whites
---
They should nerf chain MJDing too
---
Eve is closer to a "realistic total war" game than anything else out there. Most other games are snippets of time that start and end; eve is set up with no true end.
---
Strictly speaking: winning is a perspective. Is it judged in isk destroyed? Strategic assets gained? Morale changed? Ships lost? Lessons learned? 
---
Depending on an outcome, third parties pick sides, which could tip later battles both ways. Sure, additional people are great, but what if some who promise to come dont? What if they have fcs that are diamonds in the rough? What if their pilots are shit and confuse mainline FCs? What if they're infested with spies? What if they have amazing spy networks? The list goes on and on.
---
Sure eve's a game like any other, but the strategy required on all the different levels isn't possible in any other game out there.
---
I used to listen to Talking in Stations a lot since I have a decent travel time to work, at first I used to think that Matterall (the host of TiS) was playing dumb to elicit conversation from his co-hosts but over time I've come to the conclusion that he is genuinely clueless.
---
Area 51 raid congressions

A lot of these would simply make super alliances even stronger.

Isn't part of this whole blackout thing an effort to inject fun and actual PvP gameplay into nullsec?
---
They hated jesus because he spoke the truth

It was a question. See the question mark? It seems that's where you stand.

"You wouldn't understand, you are just an entitled farmer" is his go to response, pathetic.

Ahhh i see now, i just routed it to a storage facility then routed that to the factory, and the factory to more storage

---
&gt; “I want to roam around undetected, preferably cloaked, through somebody elses space, because I dislike risk” 
---
I want to mine with my bot alts protected by a supercap umbrella and with perfect intel because I dislike risk.
---
A question, have you considered his point of view at all?
---
Imagine neither of us had ever played Eve. I ask you to give me a super detailed analysis of his position. One that is cold, emotionless, and contains absolutely no-judgment. It lists all the things that are considered, and it lists all the things that are *not* considered. The analysis itself would not advocate for any one play-style over another, regardless of long-term consequence to the game. The analysis is worded to avoid knee-jerk reactions, and avoid outrage.
---
What would that analysis look like?
---
Problem is you need to be sure that those new players are out there and numerous enough to replace the bitter vets you're getting rid of. Otherwise you end up with nothing (see Star Wars Galaxies)
---
The Guardians promised to be very useful in battle.
---
Yeah the issue is more like there are different opinions about what's good for the game, just like rl politics.
---
&gt; we have to follow those rules.
---
Yes, the rule of paying the bill or your name gets removed.
---
&gt; why do we have to pay concord for those?
---
This is an arbitrary gameplay decision. It's irrelevant who it goes to. It could just go to civilian workers.
---
Yup. That's exactly my point.
---
If he wasn't following through, then we could argue he is only benefitting himself, but he is doing exactly what people voted for him to do.
---
Unless they are making the argument every vote was just his alts or troll votes, but that doesn't sound like what they are saying.
---
Sure, if you want to take that position.
---
But then also wouldn't taking action that hurts goons be representing those that voted for him?
---
Minmatar regional bordering a Gallente .5, most likely Bei, bordering Colelie.. It's the .5 chokepoint between Gallente and Minmatar hisec.
---
So, mostly the same?
---
well, one reason of that is that larger groups are far better at coordinating, optimizing and will enforcement.
---
as in rl, the small entities merged to large blocs that live in peace to not get killed by other large blocs. this merging of groups was never a game design, but the answer of the players.
---
the only szenarios where large groups fall apart to small ones are catastrophes. and i have the feeling that ccp is trying exactly that
---
Making it labor intensive would be a good move in that direction.   
---
If transport was lucrative and labor intensive enough to justify fleets, it'd go a long way towards creating the dynamics most people seem to want.
---
I see your point, but it's a bit of a double-edge, since I can level while I'm not playing the game, and I don't end up getting into expensive ships too quickly before I learn to work with the smaller, cheaper ones.  It's not great that certain playstyles or even safety (like the better cloak) is locked behind a time-gate, though.  A subscription doubles the time you can progress, which I'm happy to pay for.  Online games take money to run, and I think CCP should be paid regularly to do so.
---
I will certainly give you that paying real cash for Plex is a strange thing, because in a sense, you're literally throwing money away.  I don't know what the alternative would be for eve, since it's built around risk and permaloss, but what would you have instead?  Take away the ability to lose ships or make money faster?  There aren't a lot of options that I can see if you want a real feeling of risk and fear of loss.
---
This game is not for anybody, it has a niche, it doesn't need fundamental changes but should work on its strengths,  instead devs are trying to make it become something it's not. 
---
I'm not a veteran player but I understand this, perhaps explain it to the newbies better instead of trying awkward gymnastics.
---
Okay, fair call. I interpreted it as a rhetorical, and not an actual question. 
---
I can correct that.
---
Reddit gold for you fellow redditor lmao!
---
NIGHT VISION GOGGLES!!!
---
The structures on the planet would be irradiated though.
---
What's his IGN and alts?
---
Way
---
You get shot, you will die
---
I feel like you have watched CCP think they know better repeatedly over the years only to later realize they were wrong when their actions negatively impacted the game.
---
I know you live in your own reality but jfyi I had 2000+ votes in ballots cast less than 5 times.
---
`Extractor &gt; Storage/Launcher &gt; Factory` is basically the ideal way to do it. 
---
The output of the first factory can either go back to storage, or directly to a higher tier factory. It's dependent on what you're producing.
---
RIP.
---
On a side note, MCAV is recruiting
---
&gt;Unless they are making the argument every vote was just his alts or troll votes, but that doesn't sound like what they are saying.
---
They will now! I remember some crazy tinfoil-hat wearing people years ago who said all Goons were Mittens alts. How the times have changed.
---
It’s not about making it harder it’s about making it less safe, WHs are already quite dangerous compared to NS super umbrella as groups roll C5 stats looking for dread kills, and you’re sieged not like you can just warpoff like a super
---
Big oof.
---
That’s exactly correct. And that’s also where my point comes in. The “bitter vets” chase away some (not all) new players. But if they’re only providing income for CCP by way of buying the PLEX from the newbros, CCP stands a better chance of making not only money from subs but also the PLEX that they buy to boost. Then they learn to skill farm, and grow to having capitals and null sec empires, and the cycle repeats. But if the we can get 10 newbros to stick around for every one “bitter vet” that leaves........
---
There are 3 fees Nullsec alliances pay and you have only justified one.
---
TCU Sov Bills - Paid to Concord - Concord puts your name on the map
---
IHub Service bills - Paid to Concord - Concord does nothing
---
Market Sales taxes - Paid to SCC (which is concord) - does nothing
---
The ihub is the big answer. We pay concord and get the right to do things in our space. If it is lawless we shouldn't have to pay them anything to anchor and upgrade ihubs. 
---
Then sales taxes which are universal but still something we are paying NPCs for. Why, we run the markets and the stations, what is concord providing us here to have the right to collect taxes. The space is lawless.
---
So if you want to argue concord doesn't provide us with anything that they can stop collecting those fees. Or if you agree as I do that concord does provide these services and has stopped providing full functionality, then the price should be reduced.
---
Almost 200m here, still remember the thrill when I hit 100. NO skill injectors ever.
---
&gt; I never, not once, saw anybody advocating solely for something that would benefit their members at the expense of the game.
---
Not even from Sort Dragon, or did you never have the "pleasure" of being on the same CSM?
---
Exactly this. I dont understand people who don t understand the game is about discovering things slowly. It's its niche, to be harsh and complex.
---
Like teah, the ui is shit since 16 years, maybe time to admit it's not the game strength.
---
Zkill suggests that plenty of people are still using excavators, since the number of the things killed in August is expected to be around 1200 vs the 3-400 pre black out.
---
To be honest, you weren't really playing the game.
---
10% attention for 1-2 hours a night equates to 6-12 minutes actually playing the game.
---
Set up PI or something if you want afk ISK.
---
Slightly left of the middle of the pic
---
Just to point out one well documented case: aryth trying to take down the mer. If not for the rest of the player base bandung against it ccpnwoukd ahve gone on with it.
---
&gt;So looking at the responses of the latest interview with Olmeca Gold I was somewhat surprised by the creativity of some insults thrown at him. (...) "Fuck you dumb autistic cunt"
---
That's not creative in the slightest.
---
TO ALL THE GOONS
---
We are not here to ruin the game, we are here to ruin "your" game. 
---
Sound familiar?
---
Adapt or die.
---
Easy to spew that shit when changes benefit you.
---
Players are not the ones developing the game. What a retarded statement.
---
They said that about mining, but look where we are now.
---
Perhaps yeah, although I dont mind it if we see less big fleet fights that involve a lot of 3rd parties dicking around for basically / mostly just km’s rather than bring actually strategically involved
---
What do you use to take screenshots at this quality?
---
Keep in mind it's really hard for people outside of beans to take over that fleet ( like no offensive it's your home the rest of us are literally just guests in your fort ). 
---
Now the big mistakes in my mind: 
---
Rokh's and ravens setup sorry but it was never gonna work, the rokh's are to slow to keep up with the ravens really use either one. 
---
Like that alone was like fleet breaking now we also didn't really put pressure on hostile logi by target swapping or really anchored up all that well leading to a lot of people missing booshes because battleships being slower the some of the others.
---
I'm honestly not gonna lay that on 1 person because really that shit should have been planned before taking the fleet out, to begin with.
---
A detailed analysis of his position?  He thinks that he knows best.  He is wrong.  I'm not going to go into a long ass diatribe.  It has been covered in detail in this subreddit for well over a year.  He is nothing more than a grr gon hat gon moron.  He thinks that he is some sort of saviour.  He thinks that he has hurt GSF with his little Delve Pest Control.  Now he thinks that he is somehow superior to everyone because he got elected to the CSM by a couple skill farmers.  The guy is an idiot.  Not a single one of his ideas are good.  They only serve to enrich him.  That is his entire premise.  When the latest Rorqual nerf hit by making the Excavators take up more space he threw a hissy fit because now he couldn't haul as many.  He falsely claimed that the change made Rorquals safer.  No, he was just going to lose out on some income from the change.
---
Nothing he does or proposes is for the benefit of others.  Absolutely nothing.  He only thinks of himself.  That is the problem with him.  And anyone, and I mean even non-GSF people as well, who dare disagrees with him he just blocks.  He refuses to converse with his detractors.  He claims it is because he gets attacked.  He does get attacked, but only after instigating it himself.
---
As to your task you have asked me to complete, if we both have never before played Eve, I would not be able to give you a super detailed analysis of his position.  
---
As far as what his position is, it is that Goonies are evil, and must be taken down.  That is the crux of it.  Everything boils down to his hate boner for GSF and his desire to get rich and seem important.
---
Dumb question but 
---
Is this real?
---
I think local should stay as-is now. It's the death of bots and idiots. Anyone else can deal with it just fine.
---
And then all the indy guys who's shit got lost in the unachor will go back to using Jita because their shit isn't gonna get dropped out when the big blocks decide to unanchor it again.
---
Wait, those guys were at war? I went to that hole for my first ever WH trip and their Zkill listed them as "snuggly"
---
Yes, they're changing the model of Jita 4-4. It's on Sisi.
---
Stainguy is literally arguing that in the other thread lol
---
When did the "botting era" start? Can you point it on the graph?
---
I do not recommend playing World of Warcraft.
---
It looks fantastic, beautiful screenshot.
---
Only your opinion is detrimental to the game. The Era of Chaos is the types of things you have advocated for, and numbers are WAY down, and I don't mean krabbing. The only thing sustaining their hope for bonuses are the massive amounts of SP they keep giving away to entice people to login.
---
The flood gates for the unironic pubbie (goons) masses have been opened. Olmecca is only ever going to get shit on by them in part because that's the thing to do. I'll fully admit I don't like Olmecca and I have him blocked, but it's due to the discourse I've had with him, nothing to do with some stupid mantra of him being held up as the attention whore of Delve or whatever. Olmecca has brought quite a bit of ire down on himself sheerly through really dumb statements and stances the last couple of years, but you're right that it often degrades into really personal attacks instead of "Hey, this is a dumb idea and here's why."  I don't see that changing personally because the people you're trying to reach aren't typically reasonable people. They're the kind of dudes really caught up in whatever narrative is spun for whatever organization they're with, and that narrative is just how things are.
---
He was elected by a bunch of skill farmers and PANFAM
---
I remember that as a joke, dont remember seeing it literally used.
---
If you went to Impass you would find many to boosh. But you only want to target Goons.
---
There are npcs on those stations.
---
And in all of those places.
---
Concord provides you with your name on the map.
---
And pays all your wages.
---
It's easier to hate the player than the game.
---
Lolmeca just got his booshing nerfed by accident is why he bitches about it now.
---
He doesn't incur risk. He runs at the first sign of something with a weapon system.
---
Removing the concept of static holes maybe?
---
Build a storage facility and rout me your extracted P0 to that. Then route the P0 from the storage facility to a factory then to another storage facility. That way you never loose your excess extracted P0.
---
Instead of all these changes all they had to do was remove standings and whatch nullsec burn
---
Dude, that is exactly how you got elected. Don't lie.
---
Definitely the age of butthurt, screechingmega coalition F1 monkeys.
---
Fuck you
---
lvl 4 != Triglavians
---
That might be an actual spoke as surely thousands of bits stopped logging after blackout.
---
The NPCs don't control the market, we do by way of the service.
---
I covered the name on the map and already agreed with that on the cost associated with TCUs
---
Where are there NPCs on ihubs?
---
Concord paying our wages is because they want less pirates. Concord didn't pay us to kill drifters in our space and still did.
---
There is no reason for Nullsec to play by concords rules, so we should not have to pay sales taxes or ihub fees. Those are concords rules and you said nullsec was lawless.
---
That's what they want you to *believe*...
---
I hope that peace in high-sec space is achieved which give players a wider range.

Oh you reminded me, speaking of taking over the fleet, fleet boss was afk (urgent real life shit, it turned out) and in fleet command. that's why we all had to self-warp and why we couldn't fleet-warp off to regroup
---
But yeah, nothing about that was optimal, that's what happens when you try to fit the preparation we should have been doing for several months into 12 hours over 3 days.
---
&gt;"Fuck you dumb autistic cunt"
---
ftfy
---
Simple, you leave the blue donut and start shooting everyone wyuth a small, focused group of players.
---
Yup. Wait for the next Outrage of the Day and have a field day. SP event is ending, so I think its gonna be a buncha dramaqueens crying that they were "punished" for not logging in.
---
The NPCs that live and work on your citadel?
---
Last I checked, no player is manually processing and delivering goods between pilots hangars.
---
Sure, and Concord will stop paying you.
---
Thats a lot of dead ships. 300b+ Are all of those stuff killed due to no asset safety after the fort was destroyed?
---
It is not CCP's fault bug empires are super risk averse these days and blued everything.
---
The only fault they have is that players no longer have incentive to invade territories as resources are basically infinite, if you control a decent region.
---
Agree with author of the article. Stop insulting people with alternate views. I disagree generally with many changes recently made and  think that it just increases the push for people to gather into larger blocks. With every change that olmeca is suggesting is making goons more powerful, not less powerful. The last and next MER will prove that. The cyno changes will also help make bigger, organized groups more viable while the little guy remains isolated and vulnerable.
---
Theses guys pushing the changes this far are pushing a style that they think is driving gameplay in a direction they want to see. It is affecting numbers in game that ccp is trying to hide via skillpoint schemes designed to keep people logging in. Since 2012 when I started numbers are at all time low, to continue on their trajectory if they dont wake up and smell flowers. Goons will out last all as they are the most organized and structured with endless resources at disposal. Mix the resources up and make them go get them. Create the drivers for conflict. Blackout does not do this, nor will cynos.
---
Blackout however has bought positive changes to botting. May have helped olmeca steal a few more drones also but hey 😋
---
Ah shit you got me good
---
The bounties have nothing to do with this, what do you not follow about that. The bounties are there because concord wants the pirate factions to be less strong. It has nothing to do with players living in that space. If no one had an ihub or a tcu or a citadel in that space concord still pays those bounties.
---
If you look at the money a non capsuleer makes, they say a lifetime of money is a few isk. So 2.5% of what we sell makes billions of people set for life. That doesn't add up.
---
Also what about ihubs? Concord imposes a fee if we want to put down cyno jammers, or beacons, or bridges.
---
T3 mats come from wormholes btw
---
;)
---
His entire stance is “your fun is wrong and i want to take it away for my fun”
---
which is fine with gameplay.
---
But this fuck is trying to change the GAME MECHANICS to do so.  To me it’s akin to hacking a game to make yourself win because fuck who you’re beating right?
---
His interviews are all so ego centric and adamant that he *knows* he’s right, he *knows* the people he hates and wants to fuck over deserve it, and that’s his entire campaign.
---
It’s disgusting that eve pvp has become whoever can make the devs bend the game to make their playstyle win.
---
Miners mining doesn’t force pvpers to die or become weaker.  Miners mining doesn’t FORCE pvpers to die and lose everything. It just gives them more to use.
---
Pvpers roaming, same, it doesn’t force anything.  But pvpers begging the devs to destroy the barriers to their playstyle winning is fucking ridiculous
---
And i don’t really care if nobody else realizes that.  It’s fact.
---
My main was born on 05, and I first won EVE a long time ago. Resubbed last December, passed 100m SP last month. It put a wee smile on my face.
---
Bro... I mean this as respectfully as I can.
---
Everything of yours, every video, every rant.. you either win and brag about your genius
---
Or lose and call some bullshit excuse or conspiracy theory to “justify” not having to grow or learn yourself.
---
I honestly think you’re just eves most brilliant troll on a 9th level to take the absurd stances you do, and if you do... bravo.
---
But otherwise good god man, take a step back and reflect on your own crazy accusations when discussing “bears”
---
because they were unfited. and i had 9 more that were handed out
---
Less than 10 is quality, give it a listen
---
They'll probably do what they usually do.  A huge nerfbat that will not take your caps away but will you want to fly something else.
---
Which is a good idea.
---
Capitals only hitting capitals.  Sortof like how shooting a frig feels in a battleship.  You'll only want to drop them on other capitals or structures.
---
Well structures have enough of an incentive but still people moan about them like crazy.
---
ERM my god. I feel you guys arn't even reading the post fully. You stop at one point you don't agree with and go from there. 
---
A. The whole PVE down the chain was hypothetical to holes being unrollable. 
---
B. You guys are full of crap if your are gonna sit there and tell me people don't PVE off the statics, even more if you are C5-C5. Hell, you HOPE you find krabbers when "rage rolling" for that content. To a point I made earlier, Sure maybe some of you dudes in the slightly large corps can support krabholes, but there are many more corps that cannot, so what do they do? Utilize their statics for income AND pvp. Try to argue this all you want, what may be for your corp isn't so for all the rest. Look up any guide or advice to living in a WH, and this is the dominant way of pulling in isk for corps.
---
C. I fully understand the context of rolling the holes and the mechanics for it and how it's used in that region of space. Stop acting like wormhole space is this magical place that no one can possibly understand. It isn't. Your entire way of living depends on rolling those holes, Just like Null's dependency on gathering Intel through Local chat and support with Cyno's.
---
I stand by my statement; That I hope the most profitable space in the game gets some chaos thrown at it as well. Hell, Give all space some chaos.
---
This comment is objectively wrong.
---
You do know, that you’re trying to tell one of the best Stuka FC (bomber fleets that use AF’s and boosh’ers) in the game, that he should bring AF’s and boosh’ers into his fleets, right? :) :) :)
---
Nothing like helping to ease the Jita traffic than adding a super cool new remodeled station.
---
Not speaking for against asset safety. But some kind of insurance you pay when you know you're going on holiday may be a way around this. Not saying it's a bulletproof suggestion. Only so many things will come to mind in a five second brainstorm. When ideas like removing asset safety are considered they certainly do need to be more thoroughly thought out and from the perspective of another's shoes.
---
And they require t2 to build.
---
This post has more edge than a Gillete mach series shaving razor
---
wishing all the best for the Beans!
---
You're late https://old.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cu12pd/sisi_jita_44_is_being_renovated/
---
I thought a lot more on this recently but what about only allowing asset safety to in system citadels. Either you asset safety them to a citadel or they sit in the ether similar to how station assets were basically inaccessible. Then if you come back and all your alliances citadels are dead you can still asset safety to who ever lives there and either contract/scam/assault or some other method to get your stuff back. This removes the problem of assets being moved to lowsec but still gives players a problem of getting them back. It would still require a keepstar to get your titan out or a fort/sotiyo to get your capitals out but isn't oppressive.
---
What did burners do to npc ns?
---
Lmao nah, your ideas are retarded tbh.
---
Yes, and there are billions of people in nullsec, where logistics is harder and costs are increased so employees cost more.
---
But the reality is that your arguing total nonsense, as it is irrelevant.
---
The real change this line of thinking will result in is nothing more than a name change to the entity being paid.
---
So [I asked about something that](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cvhiq1/the_recent_olmeca_gold_interview_and_how_we_get_a/ey4jlnx/)
---
&gt;\[...\] contains absolutely no-judgment. \[...\]
---
And then in the first line you say "He is wrong." I'll give you the benefit of the doubt in that you didn't read the comment. 
---
But if you did, then you would have been better off just flatly saying "no, I won't" instead of indulging me. Right now, it looks like *you can't even pretend to be unbiased*. If I hadn't played Eve before today, and read your post, you certainly would **not** have the slightest bit of convincing. 
---
Now that I think about it... you're an Olmeca alt. You're just a deliberate [foil](https://literarydevices.net/foil/) for your narrative, and you've tricked me into arguing your own position. 
---
Well played sir.
---
He could always bring proper counter instead of being a risk averse faggot with one of the most braindead comps around... but yeah I guess man.
---
it's private
---
inb4 they add tethering to it
---
It was used as a joke. But we should never underestimate human stupidity.
---
How about the overview not breaking itself and not properly updating
---
That’d be neat
---
A guristas wants to know your position
---
lol i don’t know eve people like that ^_^, now if what you said is true then you know that fighters get destroyed. what if your stukas/ bombers got nerfed would you rage quit or adapt ?  that’s all games are nowadays, you don’t like the meta, make a doctrine to counter it, your first riddle is the munin :))) , wishing for nerfs doesn’t count :DD
---
This is something I can get behind.
---
Just like Yulai, amiright
---
There are two ~~genders~~ narratives on /r/eve: Grr Goons Hat Goons, and Goons Were Right All Along. As Olmeca does not represent Goons Were Right, you obviously must have been paid off by him to write this post and this post must be thinly veiled Grr Goons Hat Goons.
---
^(&lt;/s&gt;)
---
Then they need to do it. Because right now CCP is full of shit if they want to imply concord doesn't operate in nullsec then leave us alone. I am sure the players could come up with a way of fueling the fluid routers to give us local back but Hilmar has 0 fucking clue how eve works and is just fucking with the game for his entertainment.
---
I'll give you that. But it's not something that I'd risk in PVP on a regular basis. If I wanted to fly a cruiser costing so much more than my usual Caracal in PVP, it would be a HAC.
---
&gt;Cynojammers, Cynobeacons and Jump Bridges have to be anchored at least 500km from other upwell structures
---
That's about the only one I agree with.
---
&gt;The security level in nullsec is now organic and will be higher the more NPCs are being killed in the system.
---
Not sure what this would be good for. 
---
Currently people upgrade their space. Means they will stay where they are, system index is visible on the map and a big "I AM HERE IN SHINY STUFF" beacon to anyone who wants to fight them.
---
And I like that.
---
A timer on dictor bubbles for the dictor pilot who dropped it would be great too.
---
&gt;Counterpoints: “your playstyle is wrong because fuck you” is his entire stance and that’s unhealthy.

---
CCP stated more that few times than small minority of players live in WH.

Now CCP could actually get the information just by issuing a simple survey to all players but for some reason CCP is not interested in any of those.

I actually got into the EVE universe because of Dust 514. I still have it in my PS3 and always makes me tear up a bit that I can never play it every time I go to play Demon Souls.
---
The potential it had, the feel of dropping in with a logi at my back as a gal sent and wrecking shit as a squad, the community and brotherhood's that were forged. I have yet to play a console based FPS that gives me the same feel. Planetside 2 was a shit show, Halo 5 Warzone feels empty... 
---
I can't play EVE, ex trashed my PC and I'm too poor to afford a decent one beyond a potatoe for work that struggles to even run Minecraft. Luckily I have a somewhat decent phone (yay free upgrades) so hopefully Echoes can satisfy my itch. If not I'll just keep lurking here, being jealous of you lucky bastards.
---
No he’s a wormholer. He station trades in Thera all day
---
The blackout is not good for eve and the drastic drop off of player action has proven that. CCP is using some metric they wont share to claim it has been a complete success but the metrics they do provide paint a very different picture.
---
Also I haven't done a nullsec site since 2012 or mined since even longer so no I don't want unfettered safety and isk generation. I want CCP to actually develop their game and not make random changes attacking player groups they don't like.
---
I bet a bil they will

Where on the probe box do you click to drag probes around?
---
It's been relatively stable since 2015, with some peaks and dips. Whether that's a good or a bad thing is up to your stance on "OMG, Eve is dying".
---
I think CCP isn't doing to badly on PCU. Sure the game has issues (Titans online in nullsec, giant blue donuts everywhere etc) but it seems quite healthy if you ask me.
---
This is actually a good way to introduce new mechanics into the game
---
I just made pros &amp; cons of playing eve, rolled the dice and its time for break. ;D
---
But ill stay and mine some salt on reddit.

That’s entry level across the US. Experienced developers are more on the $50~ in non major cities and probably like $70-80 or more in larger towns.
---
You know what is the real problem.    
---
That people are angry at CCP, like honestly there is now shitload of people angry at CCP.             
---
Olmeca is simply getting into crossfire as many of the changes that were not even considered for like 15 years ... are now implemented 'on the fly' , many of those changes Olmeca supports trying to implement even bigger changes.                
---
**For example he proposes capital EHP nerfs.**      
---
For those that not aware capitals initially dodn't have capital modules and initial EHP was bigger than you can get now. You have just fit some resists and had plenty of utility slots to use.           
---
Fast forward - changes were made, EHP was nerfed in a significant way ^(faction titans have now EHP you could have on old titans) and people now have to choose :             
---
* you fit for tank ^(aka fleet PVP fit)                                      
---
* you fit for utility ^(for example super can have tanked carrier EHP , quite often this is the 'ratting fit)                
---
Ok so what EHP nerf will change :                
---
* for sure will make capitals easier to kill by subcaps ^(but for reference the utility fit super, aka ratting dies to bunch of subcaps in like 2-3 minutes)                                 
---
* will ruin any kind of capital gameplay and fights. ^(the PVP fit capital ships melt already under the pressure from other capitals, even without titans on grid dread live when he gets primary is Emergency damage control time + 20s)                
---
If ratting fit super can have &lt;3mil EHP and fleet fit can get 24mil EHP ... why you even consider punishing people that want to do certain PVP and fit properly ?              
---
Like at this point you can start to think : **maybe someone want easier kills**
---
Tether to npc stations could kill suicide ganking at warpins to stations tho.
---
Currently game has two different types of stations: old and new. Its probably confusing to new guy why he can be shot straight away when undocking from X station but no in Y station. Just extra complexity that prob does more bad than good in my opinion.
---
Just make it so that suspect timer removes tether so people can still bait retards on jita undock.

How many votes you casted on yourself 250?            
---
**Sorry but for me election should be 1 player = 1 vote** and not 1 player = 1 vote ... but also 1 player = 250 or more votes.
---
It’s hard to enforce as a player, but developers certainly have those metrics. Playstyle, people you talk to, your Corp, shared standings, free contracts / deliveries, email, credit card, etc. it’s very easy to tell whose the same account.
---
This is rare, also you are saying that EVE should be safe for higsec industry alts.            
---
It is also about all lowsec people playing with this.       
---
Like WTF.
---
If you click on their name in the overview, you can drag their portrait or double click it from the little box with approach/orbit/dock/etc commands to get an info window.
---
But if we're doing QOL changes, how about put some love into the clone window. Maybe organize by distance, highlight the station I'm in with green, make it bright red if going to accidentally a clone. Give us columns where we can organize by clone name or station or whatever.
---
Also, I need to put in a bug report, but am I the only one that has a hard time changing my death clone lately. I get some "don't do this so fast" error and have to undock and dock and try again that way.
---
Do you mean the freezing overview or the updating with new shiptypes?
---
Well you could still gank people on gates. If we think the "little guy" here they are in disadvantage in lowsec because big bois can afford / defend astras etc. without getting fucked.
---
I guess to some people bringing hundreds of dudes to station undock to block any sort of activity is fun and engaging gameplay.
---
I actually already have a video on it made. Years ago. When the site changes happened. Will I give that to you..? ...uhh thats a no ghost rider. Get good and figure it out. Take with you the knowledge that it is 100% possible and figure it out
---
Ehh most do PI havent played in about a year orso. No idea the exact spread anymore.
---
The remodel will make Jita 4-4 the only station where you can store mass amounts of anything without fees if CCP ever implements costs on storing assets.
---
Do you even play this game any more?
---
Only one in each system.

How about auto-updating the right click menu when you drop out of warp? Would be nice to have the option to Warp To something without having to refresh the menu by mousing over some other entry first.
---
Honestly i love how much less pve is happening.       
---
Those few guys in my corp that are left after the blackout actually go and hunt TEST in bombers now.        
---
I hate small ships.      
---
They die so fast - no time to see what your kid wants without dying.
---
Or storage limit. Think about this: players can invest to NPC stations to get renovation to them to have unlimited storage like lets say 100b / station to get it renovated for unlimited storage space.
---
do what? Run missions or join PIRAT?
---
Is this actually a thing?
---
It's a cloaky Loki right..
---
I'll take that offer, what's our deadline? End of the year?
---
Same way all submarines are.
---
So this is just a work in progress or is it all going to be dumb wires and stuff everywhere? When I first saw it I was like......what
---
The problem was entirely the design of the fleet that Yuri had zero prep time with. The home defense fleet was decided with a few things in mind happening that unfortunately didn't unfold and the FC of the fleet was literally changed last minute. 
---
As far as not calling targets, if you were actually in the fleet you'd know we were almost always on the edge of lock range trying to avoid their own booshes to catch the fleet. He could have called a target, but chances are people wouldn't even be able to target them, let along hit them. 
---
There was no logi whereas IH had tons of logi on field. Criticizing one FC (not an FC omegalul) for not being able to somehow make a miracle happen is completely unfair.
---
But ya know, bash on a single guy for a stupid reason while you remain an F1 warrior.
---
i just built 100s of these! the gallente use that.
---
caldari use magpulse thrusters (magnetic pulse i guess?), amarr use fusion thrusters and minmatar use plasma thrusters.
---
It was less than 5 minutes, for sure. From the time Yuri saying "Oh shit, X is the commander and I can't get it" to telling everyone to undock was maybe 2 minutes.
---
I recorded it all, would be good to review.
---
That's not chaos era, that's just fixing NS.
---
Oh okay i guess making unsubstantiated claims is what we do now
---

---
Strange how the above statement does not match with the graph.
---
There were a few FCs during the entire eviction I'd really struggle to want to ever fly again with.
---
Yeah, there was a problem with initiative from Beans but there was also way too much big dick swinging which caused a lot of bickering in Comms for stupid fucking reasons. A lot of people were really fucking tired of it after awhile and I think that's just contributed to the ultimate breakdown in communications during the final battle.
---
Need less space, not more. NPCs should push inward wherever we are not pushing out. Get rid of set piece pirate spawns and make the NPCs continually be invading from without until some hydrostatic balance of "ratters" keeps them at bay.
---
I knew of a group of people who tried doing this in c4's. In fact they setup astra's in each hole, used it for pi, and despawned the sites in the pi holes, to go to their main hole. It was not as effective as youd think, but did work...kind of.
---
Congrats!
---
A ballpark average is around 20m SP/year, for continuous training.
---
I've reached the point where I don't hesitate to pause the queue on a main character to train an alt for an unspecified time.
---
Currently I'm training all my alts into destroyers, because "Killing Spree" was just too slow and annoying in an Ibis (Corvette).
---
&gt; he blackout is not good for eve and the drastic drop off of player action has proven that. 
---
You mean the balance of the economy?
---
How is the balance of the economy bad for EVE?
---
The metrics they showed show the isk sinks/faucets are now much closer to balanced, and that overall activity in nullsec didn't really change otherwise.
---
What metrics are you looking at?
---
&gt; I want CCP to actually develop their game
---
Good, because they are.
---
IIRC docking radius on NPC stations is 500m. For citadels, I think you can't dock if some has a warp disruptor on you.
---
But they could still sell injectors.  Arguably, with no need for existing SP to be extracted, they could sell an infinite* number of injectors.  Wouldn't this improve their bottom line?

For anyone trying ot find the good stuff, its at about 55 minutes.

One capital group drops on his apostle, and then a dread group drops on that capital group. Unsure if that group is related to the apostle or not, but they didn't kill him.
---
CCP should get into the teamfight hype. Where there is randomed mini games in planet. Like how we hacking the cans, but another minigame that have some random stuff happens in it. No need as highly graphic needy as first person or third person station walking. Terraria kind of graphic should suffice, since the hacking minigame is basically point and click.  
---
Or aquarium kind of stuff. no gameplay whatsoever. Heck, aquarium out of the station or our ships will be awesome too. Its like watching a randomly generated ant farm.  
---
I mean, have you guys waiting the fleet and spend several second see the elevator on an astrahus up and down? Wondering where the people in it goes next? Watching some lights moving at the interior of your ship hangar? Are those cars? or people with torch? or hamsters with neon wheel?  
---
 Just something. Anything is okay. At least something to see in planets, stations, or ships.
---
Delete tether all together

We might never know... ;)

Meta4 scram is a sin, you're losing almost 1km of range before overheat.
---
We are having so many engaging fights due to local removal. This is the best thing that happened to null pvp in a long time.
---
Guarding? what is he gonna do? smash someone and jump before concord eats his t3?
---
Fluidic space.
---
You have no information to suggest that this was a greater effect in regards to his election than any other CSM members.
---
HE MULTIBOXED MY CAT!!!
---
Got more kills than I thought possible.
---
What information do you have to suggest this affected his election more than anyone else?
---
Because all the SP farms would unsub?  But aren't the farms subbing through ISK instead of cash?
---
If people currently buy PLEX to convert to ISK to buy skill injectors from other players why would the current demand for injectors change if the supplier simply changed to being CCP?
---
It seems that CCP is currently making profit through extractors and players are making profit through selling their farming time as SP when CCP could potentially take both profits if they simply sold injectors.
---
But I mean imagine setting up Tripple Dreads in C5s. In Theorie you could insta bounce the sites between the Holes having endless sites making 2-3b/hr. That’s quite insane imo.
---
&gt; Mine your own capitals
---
So only a dozen hulls matter, really just titans and faxes.
---
That will surely keep EVE alive.
---
Wow, so articulate.
---
And people wonder why Goons have a reputation as being idiotic and salty.
---
Yeph, you need a storage for buffer of excess stuff.  
---
Im using the storage as gauges meter to see when to start moving the extractor. The storage store nothing in it, then its time to find a new spot.
---
Care to provide any evidence of any of these challenges?
---
Bet it gave the person an aneurysm from creativity over exertion.
---
&gt; we need to work within its parameters.
---
Or we can change those parameters....
---
Yeah, I have taken lots of fights I knew would be stupid, just to see.
---
Flying safe may be statistically beneficial, but flying risky is more fun.
---
I am a simple man. I see stainguy crying again - I downvote
---
btw. are you getting paid by someone to for all the propaganda and constant complaining?

---
Sure, but also we can get CCP to implement changes that make the situation better.
---
You wanna be a bad guy? That's how!

Hecate requires the following to build:
---
&gt;2 x Optimized Nano-Engines
---
&gt;2 x Warfare Computation Core
---
&gt;2 x Fullerene Intercalated Sheets
---
&gt;8 x Metallofullerene Plating
---
&gt;2 x Electromechanical Interface Nexus
---
&gt;2 x Fulleroferrocene Power Conduits
---
&gt;2 x Reconfigured Subspace Calibrator
---
&gt;3 x Self-Assembling Nanolattice
---
&gt;10 x R.A.M.- Starship Tech
---
The blueprint copies for the ship itself is found by reverse engineering ancient relics, found in WH data sites. The RST comes from regular minerals found in all regions of space. The components are built from a combination of sleeper salvage and reacted wormhole gases (Fullerites). The minerals to make the reactions are found in all parts of space, and the reactions can be done in LS, NS, and WH space. The fuelblocks are made from reprocessed ice and PI, all of which are found in all space.
---
What T2 materials are required to build this Hecate?
---
Well, when the counterpoints are just personal attacks, I can't imagine why he'd have a hard time gleaming information from that.
---
if want to talk about CCP Fucking it up, you need look no further than the banning of GigX.
---
Looking back, tell me that somehow made the game better?
---
so you're saying Olmeca's on the CSM because he *voted for himself?*
---
Not that "your playstyle is wrong" but that "This playstyle being overwhelmingly dominant is not healthy for the game because of X, Y, Z."
---
&gt; I think you and another person on here are both alt accounts of Olmeca, where you deliberately do a bad job of representing the big null blocs.
---
Oooh, I love meta conspiracies!!!
---
Where the real conspiracy is that the conspiracies are faked to hide people from the realer conspiracy!
---
If there was a 100-toon farm, it would sub with 180bil ISK worth of PLEX each month.  It would fund this through selling the 500mil or more SP generated in the month.
---
So, CCP makes money from extractor sales and there is clearly demand for 500mil or more SP (indirect PLEX sales for CCP).
---
Wouldn't CCP make more profit by simply selling the 500mil or more SP directly?
---
As of April 2019, all interested parties are authorized to sell salt mining permits for no less than 75 million (75,000,000) ISK as well as an additional fee to cover emotional and mental trauma suffered by the Permit Handler in the issuance of this permit, not to exceed 50 million (50,000,000) ISK.
---
So bad time to sell excavators?
---
But communities are the draw, and being a toxic community that also berates any attempt by the developer to improve the game can have ramifications.
---
&gt; Just cause I dont wanna pussy up in the null blocks for free farming online doesn't make my view less valid.
---
Basically this.
---
I have things I want to do, and it is a constant pressure the best easiest ISK is in a big nullsec bloc. Whether that be running haven in supers, or running deds in Marshals.
---
But maybe I want to afford to drop supers or marshals on people without being in a big null bloc.
---
Gate guns need to die anyway.
---
He was going where the MER said the action was.
---
&gt; Only your opinion is detrimental to the game.
---
hey, it's my opinion too!!
---
Ah, it's good to see the good old 'No, u' argument back in action.
---
I, for one, would love to have a normal adult discussion about why you think the way you think is better for the game, as long as you're willing to listen to the other arguments too. I'd love you to listen to opposing arguments.
---
I, in general, don't agree with your one-sided opinion, as you might not agree with mine, and that's fine. We can disagree on the content.
---
But as the OP says, people calling you 'a raging idiot' are not helping themselves. However, you calling everyone who doesn't share your view 'braindead spodbrains/F1 warriors too dumb to get themselves safe' also isn't helping. 
---
So instead of going overboard on the polarization maybe we could ask both sides to listen?
---
&gt; The last and next MER will prove that
---
The last didn't...
---
You should go give him shit in his discord, so you can talk to the people you say don't matter.
---
I say that 1 player should be 1 vote.
---
He is regularly asking for feedback on his discord.
---
Ok i can be a guy of old date, but if someone can cast like 250 votes on himself ... wait no, still cannot accept the this fact.
---
Its almost like they are trying to compensate for something

lol w/e dude. I have literally no reason to prove this to you.

I gain nothing from lying to you. I also gain nothing from telling you. 
---
Game knowledge is sacred and I have no need to share it. Have fun running sites in your rattles!
---
Okay, friend :)
---
Lets give people ability to destroy asteroids instead of mining them and the issue is solved.      
---
Including the moon fracks.
---
&gt; But this fuck is trying to change the GAME MECHANICS to do so
---
Well, when the game mechanics encourage and reinforce the playstyle that isn't healthy for the game...you need to change the game mechanics to fix it...
---
What the hell do you think the CSM is? It's about game development and mechanics.
---
It's not about just playing the game.
---
Agree. though fast-forward excludes the build-up feeling. I assume the dread group was friendly russian group who either planned anti-drop or were watching the stream. he was live streaming
---
&gt; A detailed analysis of his position? He thinks that he knows best. He is wrong.
---
wow.
---
Hard to argue with that.
---
Add to this list ability to blow up Ore rocks and moon rocks.      
---
Instead of letting them to be mined .... you can just blow them up denying them to someone.
---
The nuance of discussion has really been lost.
---
It seems rarer and rarer that someone can present multiple competing positions and interactions and just say "I can see how people would fall in these different sides, I think this one has the most efficacy but that's based on using my values as a lens, and peopel could easily disagree with the fundamental value balance."
---
yeah whole 5 will come back to play, and whole 3 people who care to watch too, thats less accounts than i unsubbed cuz of local
---
Useful to analyze the losses

It's kinda like construction scaffolding
---
I wouldn't lose sleep over it.
---
Sure, now I'll say "Every CSM cast 250 votes for themselves."
---
What will you say?
---
His own agenda got him elected to the CSM, so evidently it's not only his own agenda that he's pushing. Or is that only valid when it's a nullbloc guy getting elected?

Nah, the Tank is full of Honor, not Humour.

CCP Keeps removing reasons to undock, then brags about MTU,DCU, WTFU numbers and shit! There will be hardly anyone left playing by the time they are done with the \*CHAOS ERA\*     
---
 LOL on that business model.
---
fairly simple math
---
yeah, but a WHOLE hour of build up is just not worth it. The pay-off isn't that great.
---
That this is still wrong, as you have people that have only one vote.          
---
Like seriously you cannot call this 'election' if your vote is as much worth as much you pay to the CCP.           
---
I have no problem with only omega players vote ... but not with "the more you pay - the more votes you have".
---
Alright I was going to stop replying but Ill leave you with this. Ask any wormholer. Any real wormholer, one who would actually have knowledge on it, someone who would have a C5 farm or in a corp with people that would have a C5 farm.
---
 Ask them if its possible. Ask them if they have done it, and if your good enough friends with them, ask them how to do it.
---
You 100% can 2 cycle C5 sites with two nags consistently and reliably(read: every time) If you cant do it, your doing it wrong. Sit down, theory craft it, and figure it out.
---
Or go back to your slow ass rattles and do you thing, which apparently also includes being an ass on reddit ))
---
he's a goon, goons have the manpower to shutdown the jita undock so it makes sense that he would be heavily invested in keeping it possible.
---
"build a titan and then have him decide whether he wants 0 tank on 90 plus billion isk ship or just be fully countered by any group fitted with speed or thats simply smaller?"  This only sounds like a problem if your fleet is just titans, you could always bring support for the smaller/faster stuff y'know...like every other ship class does...
---
Yeah I fced a few days ago
---
Alright I was going to stop replying but Ill leave you with this. Ask any nullseccer. Any real nullseccer, one who would actually have knowledge on it, someone who would have a super umbrella or in a corp with people that would have a super umbrella.
---
Ask them if its possible. Ask them if they have done it, and if your good enough friends with them, ask them how to do it.

You 100% can get 250M ticks consistently and reliably(read: every time) If you cant do it, your doing it wrong. Sit down, theory craft it, and figure it out.

Oh geez, I didn't even look at the poster's name.

Explains everything.

Thanks.
---
Actually not that terrible, except the rubbish about ending blackout.
---
I got 10 accounts all subbed, all paid for with skill injectors. Not sure why i keep resubbing.
---
1 mil isk if they do that
---
You never processed my Shadow State application wtf man
---
&gt; That this is still wrong, as you have people that have only one vote.
---
Citation needed.
---
Where is your proof that each CSM member doesn't have 250 alt accounts?
---
&gt; Titans are most definitely able to be balanced
---
Citation needed, because it certainly hasn't happened so far.
---
&gt;Not everyone likes small gang or even sub-cap fights.
---
Fair enough, but not everyone likes a game where any fight can be unanswerably shut down the moment the local umbrella holder doesn't like the way they're going either.
---
"Everyone can get one if they want one" as an answer to balance requests is a pretty reliable indicator of something being grossly overpowered.
---
And here's another balance truism: the more special conditions and and exceptions you have to apply to balance something, the more likely it is that it's just a bad idea in the first place.
---
3 subbed accounts, 2 alpha accounts.

&gt; Ccp is trying to kill the pve gameplay in null.
---
Even accounting for everything that happened recently, changes to null and its PvE specifically which accumulated throughout these 7 years I was following this game is a massive net buff. Some amount of ABC ores mined with barges and belt ratting was pretty much everything you could hope for before general null overhaul.
---
Most line members were running Incursion lats or were running L4 missions for income back then.
---
Seeing someone posting about PvE gameplay in null being ruined is still ridiculous, "chaos era" or not.
---
Because retards like you got hyped,  but then quit again after realizing the game is still shit and even shittier after the ChAoS eRa!!!!
---
Anyways, keep telling yourself it's the bots that are leaving and not just adapting to the changes if that makes you feel better.
---
&gt; The combo scanners look shite in stats ...
---
They get the bonus of both scanners. And all bonuses from rigs and implants for all site types making them better than the single type analyzers.
---
Aren't you glad you don't have to act like you care about the festering pit of man children that is the user base of eve anymore? I mean fuck. Imagine bashing your head against the wall that is CCP to stop them from going through with dumb shit then getting blamed by the player base for it going through.
---
So what you're saying is you have no evidence to support your claims?
---
People got on just fine without standings before
---
The SCC finally collected enough taxes to have the engines built.

Can you leave my alts alone please.. Took all of 5 minutes to setup these bots with my scripts. Those 5 mins are precious, as I am far too busy managing my BDO Bots.

Great lecture, he’s a clever guy and that was very entertaining (to a nerd like me anyway)
---
IP ban is worthless. I have over 10k VPN's that I can access that are not part of the global recognised commercial VPN's that CCP block.
---
CCP lost the war on botting as they allowed it to be so successful, it is now out of control and deemed to be too profitable.
---
Actually it does.. and it doesn't..
---
What we do know is that this is one of the worse summers to date and after summer we are not expecting the same return in logon numbers due to the natural fall we saw 16 weeks pre summer.
---
Now we have seen what long periods of free SP has done, basically it has become worthless and CCP even recognise this... 3 years left but the decline could mean only 2 years to go till the lights turn off.
---
Tether to NPC stations *will* kill suicide ganking at warpins to stations. It would also kill dropping supers on jump freighters on lowsec stations.
---
Your opinion about this will mostly be influenced which site of the killmail you are usually on.
---
Docking games will work differently since you can't dock up while being scrammed anymore, the only way to get out is to kill the people scramming you or have suicide blackbirds to get rid of the scrams.
---
It might also open up opportunities for player groups to have a place where they can tether their bridging titan, once POS are gone, if having a proper staging structure is not an option.
---
I agree bud, wow classic is going to burn a hole in this game that will be noticeable. The white knight nerds will deny it till the last breath, but the slope will show it.
---
\*yawn\* Let me know when reeeddit and all you grr goons grow some balls and mount a war against us. Until then, idgaf.
---
They don't do that anymore? Sad...
---
This is a good idea. Probably needs to be that the current 0.5 systems are permanently 0.5, though. And that if it can go above 0?5, you can't mine a moon.
---
would be fair btw. rage rollin to evict people.
---
CCP has been throwing free SP around since May (you can see the bump) and this has eventually worn off its charm. The slope started after Christmas 2018. The slope continued regardless of any PR CCP attempted and this all because of more piss poor decisions. 
---
In short CCP has lost all sight and has thrown everything they can at trying to reconnect with what we want.
---
Falcon even tried to post a "this is what I would do" and everyone fell for it like tramps on a bag of chips.. His job is to have the pulse of the community and he spends much time here on this sub.. So of course he knew all the right triggers to make us nerds hard! He just spouted the same shit we have been for years in one condensed thread...

What makes me sad is that we have changed from a strong community that did not stand for bullshit from CCP, but over the years as a whole, we have turned into lemmings dressed as sheep (or Dino's if Test)... 
---
Watching Eve players is like watching a mass experiment of Stockholm syndrome.
---
Low-Sec is best sec.
---
Stats by ccp itself show that after the BO there is no more ISK destroy than before. So the pvp activity is still that it used to be.
---
BUT now the number of player has dropped more. Eve is more empty than before and before it was a dying game so.... It s not going to the right direction.
---
If you've won twice, then you haven't won. Congratulations on 100m sp though, that's quite the milestone!
---
Which would still make it untouchable for small gangs, any larger group can easily form a 50 man harpy fleet or similar fuck off tier gangs to completely nuke small gangs in 24 hours, and small groups mostly can't be arsed coming back for timers since they don't usually live in the area (fuck burning 30 jumps of nullsec to shoot some 500m structure that's probably going to result in helldunks).
---
This is true but yet there is no game properly reflecting the Art of teleportation and the effort it takes to Do so.
---
Depending on what Universen you Look at it takes massive maths and energy or a whole lot of knowledge about the target so the only Chance of reflecting this for a game is to let players learn this relativeley late in the game
---
let wh space out of it then iam daccord since mer shows wh space has enough goodies to farm stuff.
---
Lol I like that ".. and it doesn't .." qualifier you put in there to try and soften your take.  Clearly you think this graph is very important based on the rest of your post.  Nothing you said in the rest of your post indicated you had any doubts about the graph. 
---
Which is fine, that's your opinion and all, and you obviously think the game is dying, and I'm not entirely sure your wrong on that point (though I have my doubts).
---
But your wrong on the graph, it does mean nothing this time around.  The local blackout is a massive change and a slight down tick in logins doesn't necessarily mean anything in terms of the long term health of the game sorry.  This could easily be explained with a myriad of reasons, and the potential that this is actually helping the game is still there.  It's just too early to make a call one way or another.
---
Get a farmhole and you will make 40bil+ in just one month
---
I agree, people willing to criticise FCs are easy to find in corps. FCs, not so easy to find.
---
&gt;make it possible to lock cloaked ships from a longer range than decloaking them
---
uuuuuh... what?
---
Please make changing ship and clones a queued process when having a session change timer after docking. Constantly clicking error boxes just sucks.
---
Example: If you dock and immediately undock, the game waits for the session timer to expire and then undocks automatically.
---
I don't understand a word ... but the real special moment is when he "catches" the falling Nag at 1:04:30 ... tenderly in the arms of the apostle reps, as it comes out of siege, just in the nic of time :)

Satisfied people are busy playing the game. Unsatisfied people whine on forums.

Lorenzo is also an Olmeca alt. Every ad hominem comment against him is by people with Goon flair. It's all flair baiting. These people aren't actually in the null blocs.
---
Olmeca is playing the persecution card on Reddit, and the lack of calm, meticulously explained, arguments to _why the viewpoint_ is wrong only means he has more ammunition to take to Iceland.
---
Yeah but thats the matter of scap Engagements Overall
---
Using supers and Titans for this Kind of Engagement has a whole lot of requirements that need to be met so even those 300 goon Titans wont Do shit when the requirements for an Engagement arent met.
---
wow...i think i have never read a more ignorant post on this sub...
---
Or just make them easier to kill when out of fuel and players will clean them up. 
---
Offline POS were cleaned up pretty quick for the kill mails.
---
Man someone botting with an avatar.. how stupid can you get.
---
No they are Not getting rid of ratting as income.
---
They are trying to Balance the scale which is supportable tbh
---
And while reading deeper into these payments its more like a bribing to concord so they acknowledge that you are now the legit lord of this System
---
i think you are underestimating how profounding boring and stupid vanilla wow was
---
I love to listen to ambient / synth music while playing eve
---
I understand the problem. Unless you have two mouths, you can't suck his dick and Mittanis at the same time.
---
in other games when you get too close to a cloaked entity you can see where they are. this would obviously mean changing it so that cloak doesn't break on lock as well.
---
Yeah, but like 1,100 of those were killed in the first 3-4 days of the blackout
---
You do realize the op is arguing against balance in general, probably in reaction to chaos era changes, which is why i bring such glaring issues up.
---
That sounds so fucking boring and exactly the opposite of what eve id thought
---
I'm in Horde, content is normally undock button away, or in worst case scenario, it's ansiblex jump away.
---
I think small gangs will have plenty of content with cyno changes on the way. We will see alot more small gang sigs pop up etc.
---
You're talking about individualistic stuff, those won't affect the big picture too much. 
---
Rorqs I feel are finally balanced, perhaps some room for tweaks with panic. 
---
Next thing on CCPs mind should be to create conflict drivers that break up blue donuts. Resource caps per Region, higher Resource depletion rates vs reseouce generation rates, (at certain point you'd have to take locust fleets in less friendly space), resource distribution more uneven and which kinda rotates around, exponential upkeep costs of Citadels and sov infrastructure etc.
---
&gt; to give WHers a way to consolidate space and slowly change their mentality towards nullbloc so they're less of an oposition
---
no thanks
---
100b is pocket chance these days multiply by 100 or thousand and we wont have them in every system
---
[*Insert notable tornado ganker here*] on suicide watch
---
Damn!
---
gotta compensate for those spodbrains that quit the game after 2 years of taking the injector highway straight into boredomland?
---
Nice straw man there. Also that's not what a bigot is.
---
But that's not really it is it? I want to roam in your space without everything docking up the moment I jump the gate :)
---
That's why he is the space pope ;-)
---
It's a great excuse for why your poorly configured server which isn't set up for the numbers you have is shitting itself.
---
So everyone is an olmeca alt, and goons don't dislike olmeca or the proposed changes and nobody has any argumetns against the changes?
---
Then it sounds like the chagnes will be a smash hit.
---
Awesome!
---
o\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
---
No
---
But you can already decloak based on distance. I can see an argument for a greater decloak distance, but being able to lock a cloaked target doesn't make sense, like, it's not possible for someone to be both cloaked and somehow visible and available for someone to lock.
---
 The only way that suggestion makes sense is to have a greater range where you become visible to people in that range only without being decloaked for someone outside it, but you'd need to make it greater than point range to have any meaningful effect, at which point you've broken cloaking anywhere near a gate. There would be technical considerations as well - currently if you're cloaked you cannot affect the world around you, aka other clients have no need to know about you since you can't introduce changes into their session. You're either on-grid or you're not. With the proposed changes you're on some people's grid and not others.
---
Plus, in a group scenario, the first person to spot you will start shooting lasers, missiles, drones, all manner of things that reveal your location. In a single person scenario - again, you've conveyed the same amount of information as in the longer decloak range.
---
So I don't see the merit of such a change over a "simple" increase in the regular decloak range.
---
actually a good idea
---
Oh god, that's even better theory! Reverse psychology. 
---
Goons are in cahoots with Olmeca! They actively _want_ this change.
---
\+1 for Scotty.
---
Don't care about the rest. Don't think Eve needs "fixing".
---
That's the moment when paranoid silence turns into awkward silence.
---
Why don't you kill them?
---
How did that kill NPC null space missions? like the other missions are still there or am i missing a point?
---
Number of players dropped...they banned shit loads of bots who provide most consistent logins, Also, with BO and VNI nerfs, you see some botting Havens taking a huge fall in ratting income e.g. Branch.
---
I'm sure there are people not playing due to changes that affect the risk free krabbing style, probably many people are also now playing because things are more interesting. 
---
However, atleast in my opinions n, a bug chunk of accounts not logging in anymore are people (or robots) who'd AFK Netflix rat in VNI all day long and insta react and warp off as soon as someone appears on local.
---
too much god mode
---
When they do like 2016 your lead will run crying towards CCP, using their banndwagoned CSM-Majority to force changes making that smashing loss without even being outnumbered really look not so pathetic
---
He isn't complaining, what he is saying  is that he's okay with the changes even if they affect him negatively indirectly.
---
Not saying he’s right or wrong, but there’s always a July dip. We need to compare this to previous July’s, not the last 6 months.
---
Too many words for saying “eve is dying”
---
Although I started in 2015 people were already reeing about how eve is dying and it won’t see another year.
---
As CCP have said more unique players play the game but less accounts overall, which means more REAL people and less 20 account Multiboxers and Botters.
---
I can.t wait for the tether ! Finally we can be safe
---
No worries! It's their choice to make, and to be fair we haven't seen them complaining too much when we leave them hanging off a gate.
---
Just a bit wearisome when (as you say) there could be a decent little fight in the offering if they were willing to downsize a tad.
---
You boosh excavator drones; congratulations. CCP should fix that scan sig on them; hows that for balance.
---
Isnt that what Goons is for Mittens :p
---
Is this another whiney post about blackout and cyno Nerf from a nullbloccer? 
---
You know, idk if you can tell - but if you Plex a bunch of accounts with your afk and/or bot ratting/mining accounts then CCP does not want your "business" anymore and is actively trying to get you to piss off and go play some other game.
---
Take the hint.
---
Know how CSM works? 
---
He is pushing the agenda on which he was elected.
---
I'm still waiting,any information?
---
Damn. Really tells you why you can't be too tight on control ... sorry to see one tard fucking it up for all
---
Bot have been reported in mass in HS to make distribution mission.
---
I think, if you are rmt and it s your way to earn your life, you just adapt fast when you need to eat  :D 
---
but player can go play another game if they dont like it anymore.
---
I was waiting for it to zoom out and have that structure just be a ratting titan.
---
No, it wasn't. It had its own fleet. Its own army. It was its own thing.
---
&gt; If you fuel it it's normal local.
---
No. If this is done, it would still need to be a kind of delayed local.
---
Otherwise it just increases the costs of null while strengthening those that are in power.
---
Hmm, wait, what exactly is the purpose of a campaign running for an electoral position? What do all the other candidates stand for and do they not push their agenda forward?
---
Have you understood the very basics of political action, even if its just in a socvial simulation ?
---
Anti cheat won't do shit - the core mining/ratting systems are too easy to bot due to being mindless/zero-difficulty "work". Without completely revamping the systems that are being automated, most of CCP's efforts aren't going to do jack-shit.
---
There are many ways to get around even highly developed anti-cheat systems such as warden on WOW, so it needs to be a game-system-first approach.
---
Its not, it is an argument against the CSM as a whole institution ...
---
Having the game be a complete sandbox isn't the best idea. Give players something to fight over.
---
&gt; it's not possible for someone to be both cloaked and somehow visible and available for someone to lock.
---
sure it is, you only have to look at how its done in other games. 
---
&gt;but you'd need to make it greater than point range to have any meaningful effect, at which point you've broken cloaking anywhere near a gate. 
---
why would you need it to be greater than point range? Even if the range we quite a bit below point range like 15km you could still bait people who warped in at 100 to check the gate or sit off at 100 yourself and no one would see you. that's far from having broken the ability to watch a gate with a cloak. It would just mean that determined attackers could find someone by combing the grid eventually if they stood completely still.
---
&gt;There would be technical considerations as well - currently if you're cloaked you cannot affect the world around you, aka other clients have no need to know about you since you can't introduce changes into their session.
---
Other games can handle this, you are telling me its impossible for eve to handle this?
---
&gt;With the proposed changes you're on some people's grid and not others.
---
And?
---
&gt;Plus, in a group scenario, the first person to spot you will start shooting lasers, missiles, drones, all manner of things that reveal your location.
---
Yup. So cloaking in close proximity to other ships wouldn't be a get out of jail free card.
---
&gt;In a single person scenario - again, you've conveyed the same amount of information as in the longer decloak range.
---
Increasing the need to strike quickly from cloak rather than dilly dally close to your target while your friends finish their hot pockets.
---
I mean... He does come across a little arrogant when he says he is in channels as a favor to people and he doesn't need to be there because he can just get his ideas done by ccp
---
I don't believe the CSM has any influence on Hilmar throwing tantrums, and I also find it hard to take your views seriously. They are coming from a player that has dozens upon dozens upon dozens upon dozens upon dozens upon dozens of alts to kill a ratting Dominix. Anyone can kill stuff with a personal army, what you don't do is shittalk the people that do the same with a nailclipper.
---
Better once he maxed out CovOps skill. Before that Astero is better. Add to that the speed with which you can move about/allign means you can get through sites much faster and with more survivability.
---
Your post delivers so much salt that this post alone would be reason for me personally to stay on the righteous track.
---
&gt; A detailed analysis of his position? He thinks that he knows best. He is wrong
---
That sentence alone shows that you are not 1 inch above him in being objective for the game, you are equal to him hin pushing your agenda.
---
Nice to hear of more lowsec fights here, but you were bound to lose against that doctrine.
---
Yet we are all playing it. There is never gonna be another game quite like Eve, I'm hoping they do what they want. Outside of current null sec stasis the game is still a blast.
---
Spot the guy that didn't play when MoO were around suggesting they bin Concord.
---
Or, bear with me, perhaps no existing articles cover his exact question and that is why he chose the topic for his dissertation. And perhaps he is hoping somebody that is well versed in eve markets will see this post and respond, or that he will at least get a lead to some other useful data/sources.

if you build up your standings with the sanshas nation (or just true power really) not only would you not spawn the response fleet but said response fleet would back you up while it was there.

Yes.

---
Explains the speed creep
---
like the radial menu basicly?
---
Btw there is some gas in j144567
---
My point was that being able to be seen at some range while cloaked is practically equivalent to being decloaked at that same range. A group can easily decloak you, a single person doesn't care, they can see you. You also can't use modules while cloaked, so if you wanted to not dilly dally, you would probably uncloak anyway. You do get extra reaction time, but unless it's more range than point, people can still sneak up you and immediately hold you down, and any reaction time gained is the same if you just get decloaked at that increased range.
---
There is literally no way anything that can do serious damage is getting into your main krabbing systems. And the people claiming otherwise know it as they are farming their billions in basically complete safety. While brand new players are getting suicide yanked in high and fighting to survive as a pirate in lowsec.     
---
That's how null used to be. Your chilling ratting and all of a sudden everyone on comms is like oh shit a fleet is blasting our POS. We didn't used to have windows, timers, and asset protection.     
---
Arguing this is pointless as the CEO of CCP has made his intentions clear.
---
You never applied. I even accepted some guy named 'NCaltpleaseignore', dude looked like he'd be a solid addition. Has a rorq, doesn't speak, and wont fly a pvp ship. Very eager to join though.
---
Fuck off autist
---
A bunch of corps in high/low are getting ready for the changes and talking. Right now it's impossible for any other group to oppose a decade+ old alliance in their space. That isn't going to be the case forever. You'll be seeing us soon &lt;3
---
Ah, I see...
---
Classic mission give you 5-15k lp + drops and you need classic stuff to do it (similar to higsec aka battleship, T3C etc)     
---
It takes like 20minutes to complete it.             
---
So you need to live in the area and control it in order to be able to do those missions.               
---
Burners give you 20-30k LP, it takes 1minute to complete a mission and you can do it only in fast frigates.               
---
You can quickly gather big amount of those missions using alts and complete them in one fast run.                          
---
So in order to do classic missions and get like 300k lp you need :      
---
20 missions x 15k lp each x 20min each -&gt; 400 minutes                   
---
If you have alts to pull burners - you need like 12 burner missions to do it , because you need to make trade bookmarks etc the total time is like 3min per mission so :            
---
12 missions x ~25+k lp x 3min -&gt; 36minutes                
---
Like you see burners can generate the same ammount of LP in much much shorter time.           
---
You also do them in cheaper frigate ^(like mission BS/T3 cost over 1bil) so you are hard to tackle.       
---
Above that - you can gather burner missions  over a day and them just cycle them in one fast run while you are safe.           
---
This leads us to situation where you don't have to live in area you do the missions and you can generate insane LP amounts fast, thus having situation like now where mission hubs are full of burner running alts from various groups.
---
Ha!
---
You havent Been in dronelands or Tribute lateley right?
---
Wait... We get somet for participating?! O.o
---
would this "cost" of storing assets also apply to player-owned structures?
---
\-  Above that - you can gather burner missions over a day and them just cycle them in one fast run while you are safe.
---
I get the rest and yeah thats fucked up, but this particular point i didnt get.
---
The new player tutorial doesn’t expose you to another player hunting you down and killing you. Nor does it encourage you to do the same. It doesn’t tell you about neutral or blue scouts. It never warned you about the “Lofty.” The fact that people can do bad things to you is a fundamental part of Eve, but the NPE does almost nothing to teach that.
---
I actually pointed out this in other post here.       
---
But basically -&gt; you need ~400 minutes to get 300lp doing classic missions in BS/T3C, burners you just gather over the day and run them in like 40minutes for the same amount of LP.               
---
You can hunt guy that spends 20 min undocked in the area in a BS, but you will not get a guy that is in a frigate and doing burners if he need 2 minutes to complete a mission and dock.
---
This guy makes too much sense.. get him out of r/eve before he's tainted
---
Serious question.        
---
How do you see online numbers - you see more , the same or less people on comms and on fleets.
---
Lol make WH space like null. Yeah no, if we wanted to stay amongst the donuts we would have stayed there.
---
Then bounties won't change anything
---
Nice ideas :) Though asset safety needs to just go.
---
What you are saying - all what you need is a guy or like 10man corp that have 2000 man skill farm, and they can have a CSM representative.          
---
Like it is a skill farm after all.......
---
If i want to call Eves Erdogan a retard I will just as he likes to call us spodbrains or retarded null linemembers for thinking theres more to the game than ganking
---
If anyone believes that the blackout has only helped against botter in the slightest, they obviously still believe in Santa Claus. The bots were one of the first to solve the whole thing with Capsules on Gates. In the end, ccp made it even easier for the botters because the number of real players is decreasing. Who remains are the 24/7 running botters. 
---
CCP has managed to drive away the last really interested PVE players. Either you are forced to use these bots, or a normal PVE/mining game is no longer possible. Super performance!
---
A good thing it's not a sense of pride and accomplishment
---
But you can kill the frigates easily.
---
Forcing people to spread out to gain resources is an awesome idea.
---
Right with you. I tried grabbing the first couple, but quit bothering.
---
I dont remember guarding any gates
---
"But perhaps you're too unfamiliar with the notion of a campaign as it's more than getting some votes from a tribally voting ballot and buying the rest with ISK."

This is pretty good. I can also recommend the synthwave from space playlist
---

---
So what you are complaining about is having to take care of that range and keep it mind when planning your attack? You still seem to think that being cloaked with this system would definitely have some absurd like 50km+ range on it which isn't what i had in mind.
---
1) the guy that posted this is a null-bloc director
---
2) your proposed change won't really affect anyone 
---
3) it's the people hunting you from NPC space and other null-bloc you should be more concerned about
---
nice spite though
---
Scaffolding is important osha stuff
---
Activating normal local chat to null now is like taking an old bullet from your left leg and then fire it back to right leg.
---
I hope that we will see general resource distribution rework to fit better with current system.

Fighting every day for your resources, especially10/10. Caps are more OP now than they ever were before. Yes you had sentries carriers but they were no where as overshadowing compared to what we have today. Before blackout, their were hardly any skirmishes. Everyone made a bot program to where you like a name and system so it pinged everyone that was logged in and using it. People docked the second they saw you in local. Its a pure risk adverse feature that shouldn’t exist. Why delay it when you can get ride of it? Why even request to have it back? It you need to rely on local that bad, go to LS and/or HS.

Stockholm Syndrome crossed with Sunken Cost Fallacy if you want to be truly accurate.

---
This is a new player series by my favorite gamer, Fine Gaming Conniseur.  He's also Omega and is very enthusiastic and positive about his experience playing
---
&gt; So what you are complaining about is having to take care of that range and keep it mind when planning your attack?
---
No, there is simply no practical difference between being seen at XX km, but not uncloaked, and being directly decloaked at that XX km. Taking the XX km in mind when planning an attack, a bait, whatever, means being ready once you're "seen". So you'd want to turn modules on, unless you plan on trying to slowboat outside the XX range.
---
&gt; You still seem to think that being cloaked with this system would definitely have some absurd like 50km+ range on it which isn't what i had in mind.
---
At 10-12 km you start seeing issues around gates with just trying to cloak after breaking the jump invuln. If you have a "seen" range less than that, would it really be effective?
---
1. A one Minute dilay would already bei sufficient. Its about giving attackers a first strike opportunity.
---
The hard part is finding the fight.  PVP is all about trying to get the other guy to take a fight when you both know that you will win.  But actual fighting is generally lopsided and predetermined if you can land a scram.
---
PVE is not hard.  it is repetitive and tedious.  
---
The systems in EVE are not hard.  They are poorly designed, which make them hard to pick up initially since they are counter intuitive, but they don't go more than a later or two deep.
---
Lol you troll them in and out of the channel. You already got Rayne banned from CSM channel once. When will your reign of terror stop.
---
The surest way to ensure something never happens is for Stainguy to beg for it to happen.
---
It's a "we've found you and will ban you. You are not immune. Continue hotting at your own risk." It's a proven effective method to help bring borderline rule breakers back in line. Those who are further off the deep end reoffend and then get hit with the permaban.
---
Of course, this process works in an environment where botters are frequently and consistently caught. A 3day temp ban after a week of bitting will affect a person a lot more than the same ban after three months of botting. By that stage they're fully invested in that way of playing.
---
Wait are you saying with hacking+archaeology 5 they get a total +100 virus coherence regardless of the type of can being hacked?

I used the last few days on weekend to stalk and analyze the ratting bots of Gemini Whale United (http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/Gemini_Whale_United/structures) chinese renters of GotG. They use Myrmidons or Ishtars on better skilled chars.
---
- the bot seems quite stupid, not noticing anything else than "overview appearance"
---
- bot does not notice if hostile that entered system leaves again
---
- bot does not notice if hostile that attacked him in Anomaly is still in system.
---
- bot does not notice if he has Ships or Mobiles in dscan (astero doing data and bubble in his anom did not bother him)
---
- if you decloak on him he is in warp immediately (very bot like reaction time)
---
- they use a cloaky gate grid scout 1 or 2 jumps out that also only reacts to "ship in overview"
---
- rewarp timers originally were 15-20-25-15 minutes (increases after each ambush)
---
- after I killed his Ishtar twice he adjusted rewarp timers to 30-60 minutes.
---
Going to check system again today, record and petition that bummer. Also I will kill his Athanor ...
---
is that the one sutonia does where his mics too loud and everyone else is too quiet? with jebi making autistic noises, olmeca squeaking along and they all circle jerk about how they're so elite and cool not like those gay empire building krabbing mining big fleet f1 pusher fun having other guys?
---
You mean resource wars and skins aren't expansions??
---
you will have untether to do so and invest a few minutes tho ;)
---
and you cant keep it paused forever without killing it either
---
Yup but when active would give pretty crazy yields
---
So no fighting left since panfam arent? At least not in the line up and shoot at eachother way that GSF wished for.
---
lol i know its a touchy subject on here... ill be careful! :D
---
&gt; I could go either way with HAWs being polarized, but I’d love it if FAXes repping sub caps suffered a sig radius penalty. So full reps to supers and titans, then proportional reduction in repping power as ships get smaller...  
---
   
---
What if instead they split the reppers, one subcap line and one capital line?  
---
Gotta pick what class ship you want to rep. Could even go as far as blocking having both reps fitted at the same time.
---
I don't see how CONCORD gets the majority of its income from nullsec... Empire space has hundreds of billions if not trillions of people living in it, all paying taxes to the Empires that then contribute to CONCORD. CONCORD has zero jurisdiction over nullsec, has no desire to do so, and the couple billion capsuleers/colonists living in nullsec barely contributes to that. The way I see it, lorewise, the Empires are infinitely more powerful than capsuleers.
---
*Inhales deeply* 
---
 I love the smell of propaganda in the morning.
---
Organic security level of systems would spread big groups out a little. Hope you can see the benefit of that.
---
I would reenable local (and i believe its ccps plan anyway) to increase carebear activity and therefor targets in space for pvp and therefor overall activity in the game.
---
Target painters are the only agressive ewar module that arent influenced by the fleet bonus and it doesnt make any sense. Signature tanking as a whole would be more viable if that wasnt the case.
---
What about "I want to roam around in your space with the possibility of being detected (unless im sneaky af) but also plenty of targets in space so i dont die a natural cause while roaming"?
---
I'll take it
---
You act like CCP cares what they do to ganking
---
I want to see a zkillboard link.
---
This kinda of post is exactly what I want people to make. You explained why you think his ideas are stupid. Thank you
---
Ok explain, how.        
---
* Person can be moving at any time when he notices on alts there is no one around.            
---
* He undock/^(and or) use ceptor scout and fly max 0-2jumps^(presaged ships) 
---
So he see what is on gate, and his time on site is like 2minutes, if you probe him ... he is behind frigate gate.
---
That is your opinion, my opinion is that it will.
---
Still using those big brain ECM Brutix I see.
---
What if it's tied to ADMs in a way that you can't have it in systems where I super rats but you can have it in a system where many people live and PVP or rat/mine.
---
How is jump distance calculated? What is stopping someone from cynoing in ships to the hole then cynoing them back out tens of lightyears away?
---
You cycle your missions on alts as you get missions you want where you want.      
---
If you have enough of them - you just gather bookmarks using mission pulling alts in nullified ceptors , and when area is quiet you just undock your main runner and move to prestaged ship caches and do the missions in specific area.
---
&gt; Null Local is forever gone unless you fuel a beacon with RF times similar to a jump beacon and similar cost. If you fuel it it's normal local. 
---
My issue with this is it completely misses the fact much like most of the gankers did that having local was great for content in the first place and if people don't slap these things up you still can't fuck with them by baiting them via local etc. Local should come back end of
---
 
---
&gt;When  they do like 2016 your lead will run crying towards CCP, using their  bandwagoned CSM-Majority to force changes making that smashing loss  without even being outnumbered really look not so pathetic and weaponize  PvE-Autism (and ISB input broadcasting) to grow untouchable ...
---
That's a run-on sentence.   Breathe.
---
Anyhow, I thought the meme was that CSM was ineffective and/or in the pocket of CCP?
---
You are lucky to be in Horde, because of the 'no caps on everything that moves' rules. That makes random players coming for a fight. For other sov blobs though of for those blue to Horde it sucks I guess.
---
You are right about conflict drivers. Eversice Fozzie sov and shitadels became a thing, there is literally 0 incentive to invade someone other than some dick waving or lack of your own krab region to live in. Nullsec wars are so boring when you peel off the way skilled blocks' leaders manage to sell those endless grind, TiDi slugfests.
---
silence him!!!!
---
Subscription is a property of the account, not the character. If your account subscription lapses, all of the characters on it go into alpha mode. I imagine the MCT stays in effect, so you can still train two pilots simultaneously, however they'll both be training as alphas (half speed, limited skills).
---
I meant that as in don't Concord for tackle only but keep the response for shooting someone.
---
Which ones and how?
---
2. I dont care top much about structures out of titan range, but i would rather say make subcaps not target able by KS doomsday. Then 200km are more then sufficient. 
---
3. That only supports the hardcore gamers while more casual gamers will be left Out.
---
4. If friendly assets in front of the citadel are being attacked the gunner should be allowed to fire. Otherwise smaller entities only get fucked even more.
---
5. Dont really care and would make it more worthwhile to grind structures.
---
6. Less structure grind yay and also fixes hs war further.
---
7. Look 6. 
---
8. Same as 2. 
---
9. Would also be nice and less tidious to fly such doctrins
---
10. Doesnt really make sense and ECM should finally be reworked instead. Right now its pretty useless most of the time.
---
11. No? Why should a system have more wormholes with higher Index? Normal spawns are fair. Wormholers do already have their opportunities. 
---
12. Also completely unfair to titan owners. Its like saying they arent allowed to defend themself. 
---
13. 
---
Sirens and dromis are the only way for carriers to use points and webs. Especially against subcaps its like saying they arent allowed to defend themself.
---
The problems with caps arent their strenght in their own.  A normal fleet ist already capable to kill them with ease and getting help will also get more difficult with cyno changes. Even more and you could also completely get rid of them which will just hurt the game further. Also a big and well organized alliance should be able to defend themself even If your 10 man gang disagrees. In my opinion 80 % of the proposed changes are plain unfair to everyone who likes flying capitals.
---
Yeah, can you believe the drop off in GSF numbers?   Let's look at Dotlan.... oh, wait.
---
Absolutely no one is going to invest 1T into an NPC station that can't even hold a titan.
---
they got on just fine but we didnt have a coalition 1on1 on the server did we?
---
Yes, Zeugma wit all 5 gets 40 Strength and 130 Coherence.    
---
With one T2 Rig it gets 150 for both types of cans.    
---
Without rigs and a Blackglass you get 60 Strength and 90 Coherence, also for both types.    
---
And the Frostline is just 4 points below in each category at roughly half the prize.
---
With max skills it's really worth using the integrated  analyzers =)
---
i have standings on my list of more crazy ideas actually :)
---
Not bad, still aggressively feeding cyclones
---
dude... i want targets in space!!! and with a delay they are catchable too so i dont know why people keep saying the activity downwards trend is good for the game
---
I've thought about that for a while actually.  Ultimately the null sec groups are able to put more people in fleet than in the past, and that number has gone up pretty steadily.  But you also have to consider that groups have gotten more and more organized, allowing them to muster their members more effectively, and dual clienting and triple clienting has become ubiquitous, so going by people on comms is really the only effective way to measure.  By that metric I haven't really seen any huge differences in participation for TEST.  Our fleet sizes have scaled with our growth since I joined in 2015.  The only slight spikes we're during World War Bee and the southern war last year, for obvious reasons
---
For sublight flight, each of the different empires use their own type of power generation and propulsion. These can be identified by their T2 ship hull production costs.
---
* Amarr - Antimatter reactors, powering Fusion engines
---
* Caldari - Graviton reactors, powering Magnetic Pulse engines
---
* Gallente - Fusion reactors, powering Ion engines
---
* Minmatar - Fission reactors, powering Plasma engines
---
* CONCORD - As CONCORD was formed by members of all four empires, their ships use a mix of empire technologies. CONCORD ships use Fusion reactors, powering Plasma engines
---
* Triglavian - Central Micro-Singularity powers the entire ship. Mechanics of engines not explained, but connected. Somehow. Radiation.
---
* Drifters - They don't move through space, space moves around them
---
For faster-than-light flight, all ships are built around a Warp Drive. That Warp Drive's existence exerts 'friction' against space when traveling at sublight, explaining why ships have maximum speed limits and decelerate of their own accord. The Warp Drive combines with the ship's normal shield generators to produce an inertial damping and repulsive field around the ship, causing ships to harmlessly bounce off of each other like balloons, rather than destructively colliding. The Warp Drive can be fully activated to pull the ship into a subspace bubble, through which it is then propelled by its sublight engines, allowing it to effectively travel at speeds well beyond FTL. (As in, Cruisers travel at 1200x light speed.) Warp Drives allow for very rapid interplanetary travel, but are not fast enough for convenient interstellar travel. An unfortunate downside of Warp Drives is that once they have been turned on, they cannot be safely completely turned off again without specialized (i.e. starbase-mounted) equipment, leading to ships tendencies to undergo critical existence failure when severely damaged.
---
The third option is Capital Ship Jump Drives, Jump Bridges, and the little-seen Gravitational Transportation Field Oscillator. All of these devices work by generating short-lived artificial wormholes between their source and destination point. For Jump Drives, the destination point must be a friendly Cynosural Field beacon; and in all cases, activating these artificial wormhole generators requires an enormous amount of energy, in the form of fuel (Liquid Ozone or elemental isotopes). For the Gravitational Transportation Field Oscillator, its destination is completely random but within the star system in which it is fired.
---
that's assuming the kid stays with the game. There is limit on how much salt you can shove into someone's throat before he packs up and leaves...
---
Excellent point!
---
i think the guy genuinely cares even though he doesnt know as much about the game as we all wished he did...
---
imagine him being replaced with someone worse :X
---
That's July kills. Which was like 1500 for month.
---
WHO CARE ABOUT ACCOUNTS NOT INTERACTING WITH OTHERS AKA BOTS?THE LESS THE MERRIER.better be 5 k active  accounts online than 20 k safing up as soon some1 jump 5  away
---
sure id be fine with 10 min too but the dscan thing is probably not easily done
---
&gt; No, there is simply no practical difference between being seen at XX km, but not uncloaked, and being directly decloaked at that XX km. 
---
In a 1v1 yes there is, for example warping directly into range, and not being seen on dscan while cloaked.
---
In a larger fight you could force people to come closer and either give up a ship to try and decloak you or just let you pass by.
---
&gt;At 10-12 km you start seeing issues around gates with just trying to cloak after breaking the jump invuln.
---
So you have a problem with cloak not giving basically complete immunity? You feel cloak would be worthless if it weren't a "get out of a fight free" card?
---
zkillboard down .... character name {IN TINTIN}
---
i have yet to find that keepstar that doesnt have a gunner when your gang is in dd range...
---
trust me i tested a few!!!
---
Had to open the ingame models to see the differences, yeah.
---
And it would be true He also somehow doesnt die most of the time. He is my personal hero
---
Did you multibox multiple Rorquals?
---
main reason for my suggestion for the observatories is that we all know those are coming so i might as well put my hopes for them on the list even though i could live without them ofc
---
I think all subcaps of cruiser size of bigger should be fine to light cynos but it didnt make the list
---
Will be great to see many people bounce off with their old docking bookmarks.
---
why would there be any droppoff? it has been the established retention cycle of nullblocs for 5 + years.
---
yeah nerf the only thing that gives people the option to operate under hostile super umbrellas?!
---
Dread drop was coordinated.
---
There is a fight of Leshak with FAX support against the gang somewhere in between start and cap drop.
---
FAX supporting frigate which fought cruisers was interesting as well.
---
Sure, so it affects every candidate.

Checks out.

@CCPlease, when you guys starting to just ban all these guys in this corporation? how much more proof do you need to see that basically every character in that corp is most likely just 1 guy multibotting?...

---
Olmeca is a krablord! He even said that in his videos that live krabs in a wormhole like a chad and then spends all of that ISK trying to penetrate the goon umbrella. Call that emergent gameplay if you want, I call it krabbing for griefing.
---
this, also maybe ratting in less effective but cheaper setups, or a fleet - might look like unimaginable but if that s how everyone does it, then that's the efficient way nowadays.
---
sure, apparently for anything else you should be in nullsec
---
You already know what he wants - a lowsec gate. Focus on your mission.
---
Julius Mordan, just started playing 2 months ago, alteady a wormholer. That would be great!
---
logged in afk-multibox-pve-accounts maybe considered "not active" ?
---
what a great krab bait that is XD
---
Ive seen plenty of dissenting opinion in the discord thougg
---
that s a lot of accounts to train into cyno 5 :p
---
That sounds even worse.
---
We don't want stuff that basically forces everyone into super heavy congestion.
---
&gt; In a 1v1 yes there is, for example warping directly into range, and not being seen on dscan while cloaked.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; In a larger fight you could force people to come closer and either give up a ship to try and decloak you or just let you pass by.
---
Don't those technically buff cloaking?
---
&gt; So you have a problem with cloak not giving basically complete immunity? You feel cloak would be worthless if it weren't a "get out of a fight free" card?
---
I'm not saying it's worthless dude, you're getting way too heated up. I already said it would make sense to bump up the decloak distance, just no point in overcomplicating it for little to no benefit. And I don't see people complaining about abuse of mwd+cloak, why break it. You can already easily decloak ships that don't have a 2s align time on gates, so it's not a get out of free card.
---
Still a lot of deadsticks in wormholes though.
---
People do... It's called market trading and theres a few people that do it with a trill. And multiple hundred billion.
---
A service module is the part of the structure that needs fuel, so if you want it to consume fuel, it needs to be a service module.
---
So what's the solution that doesn't let nullblocs just throw money at it.
---
he will be replaced when the deal ends, I'm just petitioning to swap him out earlier...
---
Those people are trade related, they need to get rid of the merchandise as soon as they can. They don't stockpile THAT much stuff.  Because stuff that is sitting around doesn't generate cashflow.
---
Less logged in afk-multibox-pve players and thus the decline in totals, overall more actual-butts-in-chairs actually piloting the char that they logged in - what covers Hilmars statement of more actually ACTIVE players daily and monthly. I saw a lot of old people coming back, resubbing, or subbing additional accounts
---
how about you put something on the field that can contend with a titan, instead of asking for nerfs in it because you can’t field anything near it’s worth :D

You spelled "ping an intel channel for a response fleet to kill a single Exploration Frigate" wrong

Jebi and olmecca haven't been on uete afaik

They cheat

Logged in accounts =/= players. If 10 players unsub 100 Rorqual-Skillfarm-Accounts and 20 players resub their 2 PvP-Accounts, I am totally fine with that.
---
Hahahahahahahahaha no.
---
3 sneks in c5 configuration are about 2400 dps. 2 haw dreads is basically triple that.
---
3 accounts
---
1. specialist subcap (cs 5, hac 5, eas 5, hic 5, recon5 etc) with dread t2 skills
---
- slot 2 scanner 
---
- slot 3 scanner
---
2. can fly all subcaps but less skills to 5, carrier/dread
---
- slot 2 solo char (20m sp or so)
---
- slot 3 scanner/pi
---
3. subcap alt - soe spec 
---
- slot 2 - logi 5/scanner specialist
---
- slot 3 - freighter/trader alt
---
That would be great. Close down all gates into the alliance coresystems. Only through ansiblex Gates which are also controlled by the alliance you can get into sov. So yes stop paying concord for maintaining the gates.
---
The solution is not having it at all.

it's a good thing you don't run a business

10mn or 100mn???

You can go to highsec now and shoot bots, they are in npc corps so you'll have to suicide gank.

fun fact I do, as well as 2 social projects.

Sure you will tell me that unsubbing multiboxes taking pressure from PLEX prices are a bad thing for "the little guy" lmao ...

it's almost like you're saying big nullsec battles pull in players

They shouldnt even be in the game imo but thats too late i guess

people are less likely to listen to you when you just rage and throw insults at them, what a shocker

I'll take that bet too.

---
inb4 Aran farming
---
&gt;Like at this point you can start to think :   
---
&gt;maybe someone want easier kills
---
Of course. But his opponents do the exact same thing. The discourse in eve is long past "people trying to do the best for the game" and is firmly entrenched at "people want the best for **their** game, and **screw. anyone. else.**".
---
This is why I agree that the players are going to kill eve. Nobody is willing to give an inch of personal advantage to help the game by a mile.
---
Not really it will kill small null groups who will get swept aside
---
I think it's all about player retention and I guess "new Players" &gt; "suicide ganking". Lore-wise it somehow comes togethe (Empires increasing security .... blah blah). Tbh I like it that CCP at least fucks around with highsec a litte bit :D
---
To bad it'll be useless after they increase NPC taxes to 200% or whatever shit they get into their head next.
---
for #4: how about randomly generated systems that only live for X amount of time after which they're wiped from memory, never to be seen again? Keep people on their toes each time.
---
Only wormholes actually have risks to lose stuff.
---
Throwing money at it can be okay, as long as more risk is introduced.
---
Dynamic mining and security indexes, limits of spawns, etc.
---
&gt; by making one of the smallest cheapest T2 ships you can get the ultimate gank tool
---
Hello, this is 2009 or 10 or so, I want my punchline back.
---
ya
---
Dude I am the only CSM openly defending a 1 vote 1 player system. It was in my campaign bid.
---
I would be very careful with assessing who it would benefit though. You think there are no sp farms in the goon ballot that's just naive. Meanwhile I got twice the votes I needed to get elected so the 300 mar5hy/olmeca votes weren't even necessary. I understand that it's very hard to comprehend coming from your echo Chambers, but if you actually analyze the votes you will see my voterbase was one of the most diverse among candidates.
---
That would be cool
---
Its hard to run all that unattended afk-pve-multiboxes when there is an actual threat to them now ...

---
Sorry but fitting matters &lt;3 mil EHP with no tank and 20-30mil EHP with faction and full tank ... those are player decisions.         
---
Faxes got nerfed, the snuff fight proved that those changes actually did change a lot on battlefield.            
---
Big stuff is going to die even with fax reps and not like before that you had to first kill the fax to target bigger ships.              
---
Problem that those big fights are not happening is quite simple.        
---
Current EVE is about structures ... and you don't want to use capitals against them as they will just annihilate them.         
---
There is no objective that you want to use your capitals against.      
---
So unless someone drop capitals on grid first and you have ability to escalate ... there is no point in using them.                
---
But every one is using caps ... sure because players want to do it, want to have fun and then we have cap battle ^(excluding home land defense as you don't drop capitals to say 'i want fun' but 'GTFO')
---
Eve's microcosm is unfortunately just a reflection of the macrocosm. The internet is very good at giving a mouthpiece to the sort of angry/crazy individuals that would normally be avoided or ostracized by civilized society. But hey, gotta sell those adverts right?
---
I would like to see cloaking become a more active thing than a passive thing. That means active in how you use it and how you react to it. That's why i think it should be changed.
---
Why leave hisec if the rewards are equal to null but with added security?
---
Wingspan has a wormhole finding service as well
---
/o\
---
Isn't the main draw in the delivery missions the LP rewards? So the damage to the economy is smaller than ratting bounties, as a good share of the isk generated by payout ends up in the LP store again?

I've been wanting to see this for ages. Force alliances to become nomadic, or run a "crop rotation" around their space, otherwise their trusec drops and mining anom yields diminish with every flip.

Sad think that EVE might never actually get above 30k PCU again.

We told him why years ago, repeating the same thing over and over expecting a different result each time is the definition of insanity
---
you can partition and get a refund.
---
Whenever someone actually responds to any of my views with an argument in a civil manner instead of ad hominems and insults, I do so as well. I write thousands of words in a year to try and reason with people on Eve balance. Much more than any other CSM member.
---
So cut the crocodile tears please.
---
Well, progodleged, actually it does matter - let me explain. Yes the active pvp account are dissipating away yet, but those other accounts not logging in are most likely the active accounts' money makers. While you won't see the immediate effect, down the road one can logically conclude the lack of isk generation will have a negative effect on the active account's ability to participate in anything. It's a ripple effect that hasn't quite reached the shore yet, I expect a more realistic interpretation can be made next month as Omega's really begin to run out.
---
Then why do you want our chat to be like yours.
---
They have plenty of fault
---
- Sov being unituitive and a pain
---
- Insanely long structure timers
---
- Structure dmg cap vs log scale
---
PCU has almost dropped in half since 2015.  so yea, not exactly doing well.
---
less plex = less revenue stream for CCP =&gt; less investment cash into development and so forth... I'm not sure how you fail to understand this.
---
Again, it's hard to take away something that you've given to someone, no matter what it is. Even if that something is an under-balanced advantage to one aspect of the game. Returning things to normal levels will meet with resistance.  
---
Vote with your wallet and walk, the rest of us will continue to play and invest in the game.

drop mobile depo?

I will have you know that the ehp nerf isn't mine as an idea. I heard null leaders who would wage those capital wars proposing it, and it makes sense to me so I added it in my list.

fuck off judge, no one likes you
---
Why?
---
It's been like this forever, CCP fucks around and we players have to figure out how to ~~break it~~ adapt.
---
you are so fucking dumb
---
I can only speak for myself in that case, but I (and the people around me) just started buying PLEX again after we didn't for 3-4 years. Since the 1st chaos signs I buy PLEX monthly (additional to my 4 fully subbed accounts).

Imagine a svipul pilot defending the old out of balance cancerous svipuls because we are saying "your fun is wrong and I want to take it away for my fun" to him.
---
That's how dumb your point is. You can defend any out of balance mechanic with it.
---
And you clearly are not one of them...
---
If your investments are always in quick return items you will be very susceptible to market fluctuation and therefore will not consistently grow.  Some of these people have been sitting on tens of millions of Plex for the last 5 - 10 years waiting for a time like early this year.  They were able to name their price and get anyone to pay it because supply was soooo much shorter than demand.
---
Of course these same people have short term investments and mid term investments.  But I'm not going to dive deep into this because the more who know, the harder it is to become rich.
---
came here to say this
---
A lot of those people are leaving again, cause all their friends that stuck it out while they quit of lack of content or Eve being to safe....are leaving cause they don't like the changes.
---
Well it killed boters and the renter empires - that alone should make it more then enough reason to make it permanent.

Isn't that a thing already? It always works for me.

It's a little annoying losing the lvl5 skill, but Strat Cruisers really are *the best* subcapital PVP ships out there for most purposes. And that being *the best* can easily make the difference between a kill and a death, even if the death otherwise has less cost associated with it. I lost my Loki a few days ago, and my regret was not that I brought it as opposed to some other ship (it was the best ship for the job), but that I should have brought a slightly different fit. (And in the aftermath of my death, we killed a Tengu worth two Lokis, and its Crystal pod, so it was an acceptable loss.)

lol, where are you mining ? There is so much PvP-Content atm, even DarkSide is back and doing public roams again. And if you do not know who DarkSide is or was, I dont care about you ...

I'll be interested to see how instadock/instaundock bookmarks work with the new model.

yes and yes
---
Toxic behavior and incivility are rampant on the internet.  I've been playing some Rust lately and that has been an eye opening experience.
---
There's plenty of targets in space, it's easy to say activity is down but the ones that aren't undock ing now are the ones that would have docked when you were 5 jumps out before, if those people leave then good, they added nothing to the game before anyway.
---
The Aether Wars 2 test was... last monday. There will however be more in the future. Read stuff in the launcher from time to time^^
---
Pando coming with some good ass ideas
---
How is it's worth relevant to balance exactly?
---
It is, but it's a slew of problems before any choas era changes that are the issue,
---
Do you mean this like people warping into a system will see who has been in system for 5+ minutes immediately or will they have to be in system for 5 minutes before they can see who is in system (and before they show up in system)?
---
The Signal Cartel co-pilot has a radio feature which allows me to tune into old TEST deep space transmission streams.  It is lovely and makes me happy.
---
Permafrost was a good idea tbh only that horrible white light wasted it
---
So what you're saying is that the stats show that the people who were lost weren't involved in PvP, or else those who remain have taken up the slack?
---
And that's both on the killer and the victim sides.
---
Please biomass.
---
That's not how your change recommendations work out though. 
---
Your changes just mean nullblocs will put in and fuel structures to get short local delays.
---
End result, nullblocs have by far the shortest local delay of anywhere in null making them even safer than they already are.
---
Basically you're advocating for giving nullbloc krabbers more advantages but (poorly) disguising it as a reasonable compromise. No compromise is needed, you had the easiest safest playstyle in what was supposed to be the most dangerous part of space, and let's be real - you still do. You are due for a hard, no compromise Nerf - many actually. 
---
What's happening lately is that CCP is nerfing the most grossly OP playstyles in the game because the balance is terrible. Apparently you are one of many who subscribes to that playstyle. 
---
And let's be serious, even cloakies roaming nullsec are far from "undetectable". 
---
The problem is that you (most everyone in a nullbloc) are so used to not having to work for your Intel that you are appalled by the fact that if you want perfect intel, you are actually going to have scan your holes and monitor all entry and exits to your system. 
---
In other words, you're going to have to actually do something at the keyboard in order to maintain your security.
---
This is actually great idea, so in the end: just farm for some time and let containers to get filled with some loot, and then just collect all the stuff in a ceptor, ty!

"The only winning move is not to play"
---
- Some bot, probably
---
It's remarkably like being a politician.
---
Agreed.
---
So what are the solar panels for?
---
The Triglavians should invade Jita and mess this up.  Would be kinda cool.
---
If CCP's vision of a dynamic and changing New Eden comes true, I'd expect rogue planets, comets, solar flares (e.g., communications disruption or even citadel damage) asteroid collisions, pulsar x-ray bursts, etc... to disrupt New Eden all the time in RNG locations.  Maybe not every day but I'm sure some of those things a few times a year.   New Eden would actually become a living thing.
---
Not even from Sort.  Generally speaking, what you see from the big groups reps is an explanation of how that group will likely respond to a big change - not advocating, but merely explaining.  The goal there is to make sure CCP understands what the potential unintended consequences are.  In the end, it's their decision if they do it.
---
I would imagine it being pretty insulting for most PvP centric Null inhabitants to define your space by a chat system that is used for intel. Now if we are talking about the possibly heavy handed cyno  nerf we would be in agreement.
---
So awesome! Really wish I would of been able to be a part of this.. darn RL
---
That's why I have found that it's better to come in with a unified set of goals that everybody can get behind as being better for the game, because that's more likely to get their attention.  On the areas where folks disagree about what's best, that's a tougher sell.

Also the toaster.
---
Thanks for clearing that up, there's somewhat of a idea that Sort lobbied to have null-null hole spawn rate nerfed because PL was honorably third partying GOTG too much.
---
They are great
---
My goodness, you nullbloc kids really can't stop with begging for a local that caters to you huh?
---
Any mechanic that's pay for local is just "give my nullbloc more inherent advantages, it's not easy enough yet!" 
---
Here's to hoping CCP keeps taking away your advantages :)
---
botting should be permabanded 1st offence. It's cheating no matter what way you look at it. It give other players an advantage over regulars player working for their isk.
---
wouldnt want anyone to die on the jita undock now would we?
---
Hahahahah, it's good to see that even in response to a reasonable request without any ad hominem attacks you still feel the need to accuse me of crying 'crocodile tears'.
---
I'll just let that speak for itself.
---
This isn't the first time that phrase has translated as "fucking it up" and I suspect it won't be the last...
---
Is it? I never look at it anyway.
---
What small null groups?
---
Consensus works in empire vs empire, to prevent one empire trying to get ahead of the other using  the CSM mechanism. Good rule.
---
It doesn't work when it's empire vs other playstyles. The perspective rift is so huge.
---
Null is overrepresented because elections favor social organization and null is socially organized by default due to playstyle requirements.
---
Null is also overrepresented because people play the backroom politics game, getting in ballots of even alliances they are in conflict with. Adding a second layer of optimization via social organization.
---
Null is also overrepresented because CCP cares about what's being said on Reddit and forums and null players are more prone to talk in them because they are more invested in the social aspect of the game.
---
And as if that's not enough, if someone anti-null dares to get elected, he is expected to reach to a consensus in a council with at least 5 people with intuitions and views very opposite of him. Which is yet another mechanism of overrepresentation.
---
Beating all this overrepresentation is how much it takes to nerf a mechanic if it happens to be game breaking but something the mega empires benefit.
---
Thankfully it's possible and consensus isn't the only way to get your point across.
---
Hi, do you not know what a bigot is?
---
Seems to be in all games. I'm not sure if it's gotten worse or if I'm more observant of it.
---
Worth keeping in mind that the "mortals" living anywhere in new Eden are extremely poor compared to capsuleers. The value of a single ISK is in fact tied to the yearly income of an average mortal family living in empire space. (Set up like that to simplify trading between factions) 
---
So even if there are trillions of them living in empire space, it's entirely possible for capsuleers to lose the equivalent of their entire yearly tax income in a single battle. The battle the other day where 13 titans were lost, for instance, more than likely did that.
---
Lol, if you believe that, I have a bridge to sell you.
---
no offense but I don't feel like explaining how wrong you are simply because it's clearly evident you lack any understanding of the word "economics" nor illustrate a care to understand it.
---
That was before my time, but in my time with him, I never saw him specifically advocate for things that would have benefited DeadCo at the expense of the game. 
---
Honestly, if he'd done that, the rest of us would have jumped on him so hard he'd never try it again.
---
Maybe CCP isn't interested in retaining the PLEXing krabbers/miners that live under super umbrellas?
---
After all, those players are only valuable as content generation, which they don't provide since they live under super umbrellas.
---
Ofc you could argue that they provide content by harvesting resources for others, but no.
---
Nullblocs just dump resources into further bunkering themselves in they already safest position.
---
And the prearranged corm (or whatever) fleet flights between the nullblocs with pacts isn't exactly going to fuel new player retention past a month or two either is it?
---
I think CCP knows it's game is dead on its current trajectory, so it's trying to change that.
---
Unfortunately for you, your playstyle doesn't seem to be desired anymore.
---
Amar ships are propelled forward by expelling "expired" slaves out the back.
---
&gt; You guys probably want Olmeca to listen to you right? 
---
You presume he'd be interested in listening.
---
That's not exactly clear.
---
This is also very, very good.
---
You don't realize it but you made an argument FOR BO.  Accounts left but there is still destruction.
---
I explored a LOT for income.  I used to see system after system with 2, 3, sometimes 10 or so VNIs, Gilas, Ishtar's etc. in system.  Now they are empty.  I don't feel any lonelier because while there were alts in system and local, I was the only one with someone at the keyboard.  I welcome the emptiness.  it is more honest and real.
---
just leave it to only nullsec and ls, hs gets complications such as concord and moons, and its not like nerds are chaining anoms there
---
&gt;Whenever someone actually responds to any of my views with an argument in a civil manner instead of ad hominems and insults
---
Civil manner.  Like:
---
&gt;They don't want the recent changes and want to keep playing farmville in space
---
This place is backwards. So the guy that makes the stereotype get 64 up votes. The guy that laughs at the stereotype gets downvoted? 
---
Am I missing something?
---
I can't say that these are the worst ideas I've ever heard, but that's only because of the recent ideas Hilmar suggested during fanfest.
---
I think yes and no. We did a two hour roam yesterday in frigates in Legacy space and found a rookie ship cyno and gnosis. 
---
Also a 2bn can of minerals in a wormhole. 
---
My point is there are less things to kill because there are less people even in a large coalition such as Legacy on a Sunday evening. The NPC kills MoM in dotlan and MER states my experience isn’t an outlier, it is now a common thing that there are less fights and less content.
---
Yes, I really should start reading that stuff more often! --"
---
Thanks for the explanation pal! ;)
---
This is the thing - you're looking at this from an in-game political perspective and not from a larger view of the game as a whole.  There are a ton of things that absolutely CCP needs to fix for the betterment of the entire game that have nothing to do with "empire vs. empire."
---
For example - Faction Warfare has had fuck all done for it since it was introduced.  It needs a complete revamp, especially where citadels are concerned.  That would be beneficial to the entire game and something you could join the rest of the CSM in supporting. 
---
As I have tried to get people to understand for two years now, when you're elected you aren't elected simply to represent the interests of whatever playstyle you have. You're there to represent the players as a whole to the company.  So to say "null is over-represented" is to act like your dominant playstyle is your political party, which it isn't.
---
There are plenty of things that impact the entire game that you can work with the folks you think disagree with you where you can find consensus.  Faction Warfare, Wormholes, citadel mechanics, capital balance - these are all issues that I know everybody cares about and there's places you will all agree.  Focus on those and things will get done. 
---
And I'm telling you, if you guys end up getting into debates with each other around that table, you're going to end up getting ignored, because CCP will use any internal disagreement on the CSM as an excuse to do nothing. 
---
You say "thankfully it's possible" but the reality is that it's largely not possible.  None of the changes that have happened so far can honestly be attributed to anything you guys said or did yet.
---
Wormhole life can be brutal.  Can you imagine if NS had this kind of risk?
---
Cool.
---
I'll probably sell them.
---
This is gonna screw with my instants.
---
There's some good content on Reddit more often than not.  I'd be completely clueless about the happenings around New Eden if not for Reddit.  Do you have some kind of alternative?
---
&gt;Mix the resources up and make them go get them
---
One of the problems with r/Eve's suggestions for changing the game is they suggest changes that are already in the game.
---
There already are region-locked moon-goo (there is stuff you can only mine in the North, and stuff you can only mine in the South).  And region-locked ice.
---
Problem is everyone needs every raw material, and it's not possible to set up a "mining outpost" on other side of the galaxy.  So we all just trade in Jita.
---
Also, given the imbalance in the power of the blocs vs everyone else, "conflict drivers" aren't a terribly good idea.  They'll just result in the blocs crushing someone else.  We need more groups in null first.  The recent changes making life in null harder, and much harder if you're not in a bloc, is accomplishing the opposite.
---
And drifters and npc vs npc fights! Ceo interview on what surprised him he was like I love the npc vs npc ! Surprised me so much! gg
---
Your quote refers to people with tens of insults in the thread about Jin'taan interview with me. I didn't start the uncivility there and I won't turn the other cheek when people keep attacking and insulting me. So don't take things out of context.
---
But here is an example my response to someone actually listening the interview then criticizing it. My history is full with these elaborate and explanatory responses when people are skeptical of my views but are expressing it in a civil manner.

I have been seeing the same since 2014.
---
Ironically, nerfing the easy mode might be the best way to make for a new player experience, at least for those who survive the first few weeks.  If someone learns the only relevancy in the game is to have 20 alts, rorqs and supers/titans, they are much more likely to be intmidated from starting than someone who learns that a good tackle inty, dictor or logistics (as in trucking) can make a difference to the corp.
---
I voted for myself 5 times.

---
No if there is like 300 chars with similar name, you need to scroll and find your char.
---
aaaaaaaaaand it's delayed due to unions
---
You need players that actually buy PLEX to supply those skillfarm machines.
---
This was one of the best ideas Pando and I talked about. It solves so many problems in an elegant way.
---
Too many reasonable positive changes here, ccp will end up nerfing bombers.
---
I rather have bots in high-sec as they seem to have moved to and less ratters (still quiet a lot actually), than the perfect intel tool "local".
---
It'll only get better as using cynos will actually take skill now and lolpanicyno isn't a thing.
---
Rule of thumb, Gallente are the drone faction!
---
They mainly specialize in it!
---
Worm, Gila, and rattlesnake are something for you to aim at in the future, but right now, stick with and master Gallente.

Good luck o/
---
Obviously, but not in the direct "make people leave" way. The whiners and bitchers on this sub and the official forum convince CCP to do nonsense they shouldn't do. CCP listens to the loudest voices, and most of those are just people that scream about their idiotic problems most of the time.
---
Thank you! &lt;3
---
huh?
---
Hm. I like the Idea. But instead of not being able to have structures there I would allow them (or have a structure you could entose to gain access) and have the systems move around instead of having them dis- and then reapear. That way people would have a staging that would go around and be close to enemy staging one week and close to home the other. That way you could attack different groups each week and you would creat content as people would fight over these stagings. Also have a structure in there that cant be controlled by any group but allows everyone to bridge out of there to a cyno within 10ly. 
---
Make real chaos with constant change instead of this "chaos" CCP tries do creat.
---
Like all video game forums, people posting on r/Eve come in two, overly-simplified flavors.
---
1) People who are at work or similar situation where they can't play Eve.
---
2) People who hate the game.
---
People who like Eve are generally playing the game instead of posting about it.
---
active users is a subset of total users
---
Well, this game is complicated and learning from other players is key. Coming to these threads and streams where people are pure toxic turns people away from the game.
---
Unless they fire the entire dev team tomorrow they were going to pay them anyway so techically it costs nothing. *shrug*
---
Your risk of being killed doesn't go up because you have more loot. If you learn how to use dscan you should be pretty comfortable spamming V and seeing if theres any probes near you. The best way to manage your "risk" is to check dscan every few seconds. Unless you're intentionally exploring around the home of larger groups, you're fairly safe already. Stopping and dropping cans to return to later seems like a waste of time.
---
Plot your route in a gatecamp/killboard checker to see if anything is active, learn to avoid gatecamps. You're making mountains out of molehills with this concern

Empty of bot no pb for me. Like i said in an other post of reddit, the number of real player dropped also (just go hunting in null / low , it s just evidence, less target in space)m and this is the problem

They had their chances and just made it worse, just let the community do it.

---
That is your subjective view, its ok to have it, But as you self say, we do not have the data yet, and just raw logged in accounts does say nothing about thegames health and even more important as its essential for the games health, game economies health.
---
You could also assume from fallen logged in accounts and the CCP statement that this summer saw the highest "ACTIVITY per account" since a long time, that just the number of alt-account-farms logging in has declined, while more Accounts are online that are actually ACTIVELY played ...
---
Start joining fleets then. Since blackout iv killed 3x titans, 2x supers, countless rorqs/fax/dreads, and had plenty of small gang roams ending in fights. And less cancerous citadel grinds then ever before because fuck that damage cap and tz tank when you can kill capitals

---
&gt; There are a ton of things that absolutely CCP needs to fix for the betterment of the entire game that have nothing to do with "empire vs. empire."
---
And CSM can reach to a consensus in here. Turns out consensus is relative to topic.
---
&gt; You're there to represent the players as a whole to the company.
---
This is achievable when the topic of focus doesn't involve a conflict of interest between playstyles. It is not when it does.
---
&gt; So to say "null is over-represented" is to act like your dominant playstyle is your political party, which it isn't.
---
Eve playstyles are diverse enough that nobody is the majority, but if there was a fairer representation then it would have been easier to fix game breaking issues with null mega empires that benefit them. It didn't take a 3 year social mobilization effort to fix wormhole farming mechanics for example.
---
&gt; And I'm telling you, if you guys end up getting into debates with each other around that table, you're going to end up getting ignored
---
To me, the only viable strategy is seeking consensus on issues which a consensus is reachable, and relaying my own side of things when consensus isn't reachable. 
---
I can't not talk about issues which I explicitly campaigned to relay to CCP, just because some people might disagree and a 2-hour debate might emerge from that.
---
&gt; You say "thankfully it's possible" but the reality is that it's largely not possible. 
---
So far I have removed several items from my "big problems with Eve" document so it seems to be going well. I don't know whether this is me in the CSM, the impact/success of the campaign/video, or not me at all; but I will keep doing what I do.
---
Yeah Rust makes Eve look like a civilised meeting of courteous individuals, in comparison.

What, why??? People don't care for a nice gudfite as its own reward?
---
This makes no sense. It's like saying CSGO died because they made skins untradable.
---
I laughed at that solar panel, because my newest ship Maelstrom really have a big ass "wing" for solar panel haha
---
You balance that with resource depletion and regeneration rates along with ADMs, so, like mining and ratting is kinda shitty if ADMs aren't high, sov infrastructure or not.
---
Unless resources aren't scare enough, there isn't going to be a conflict, so make it scarce.
---
I wasn't specific enough, I see. 
---
I was referring to VOLUME of stuff. Plex is like a 0.1m^3 item or so? 
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but as I remember CCP made a comment about taxing the volume of stuff in the personal vault.
---
I think what no one gets is that CCP doesn't want a lot of it's current player base as they are.
---
Why? Because the way the game is currently played is stagnant and boring as you pointed out.
---
The game will cease to exist on its current trajectory.
---
That's why we are seeing so many changes.
---
CCP wants nullblocs to gone in their current form.
---
They want new player retention and big headliner fleet flights happening frequently. 
---
Nullblocs are repressive to both of these things in their current state. 
---
So CCP is saying to the PLEXing nullbloc krabbers and miners (through their changes) HTFU or GTFO, we don't want you anymore.
---
so... when do we get those?
---
1 isk
---
After the last bit fight, they announced changes to bumping.....
---
I m 100% lone pvper, never did pve stuff since 2018. Of course i sell the loot :=)
---
But like i say for my playstyle too it s a pb because there is a lot less target in null / Low.
---
Before fax changes i was on dread drops where people lost like 50 dreads and killed not less faxes, but no bigger ship died as faxes tanked the dps.         
---
While i didn't was on the snuff fight ^(first real fight after the changes) what i heard is that "fax rep didn't hold" ... the KB proves this, and while cynoed in not perfect spot still they were unable to hold stuff that could be considered safe before the changes.
---
ok, your point?
---
You got it all wrong. Once the destruction catches up to mining &amp; production (seriously doubt it), prices of ore &amp; minerals will go up, incentivizing more people to mine in order to satisfy demand, mining will jump up in more cost efficient ways and in smaller scale than what we were used to with multiboxed excavator rorquals. 
---
If I am not mistaken one of prominent issues now with EVE is almost absenting resource scarcity, less mining should fix it.
---
Nice
---
From what i am hearing actually many 'right people' noticed that there is something wrong with blue loot.         
---
But this hardly tells if something will be changed.
---
Proviblock for a start and other non bloc groups
---
i rather had 10 olmecas (aka unalligned people) in CSM than 5 goons and 5 test guys and 2 [insert other null block here] guys
---
I guess so if all you do is farm miners and ratters?
---
But I think that's kind of the point.
---
Farming afk ratters and miners is not the gameplay that promotes new player retention, it's boring. CCP wants it gone.
---
carebears make ships, people like ships   
---

---
Would be interesting if all the station services went offline during this remodeling.
---
That's my point mate.
---
I'm curious if eve-offline counts the players the just get to character selection screen or if it only counts people who actually log into a character - I'm not sure how it would be able to differ between the two. What I'm saying is that these statistic could potentially be much worse than what's immediately observed if one considers the skew from skill injector log-in bait.
---
Adapt or die retard
---
I think your methodology is dubious, you would want to compare numbers with summer of 2 years ago. Yes we can dee 5k dropped on the first day of blackout, and to anyone who roamed across null it is fairly realistic that 5k of botters stopped logging in.
---
If you didn't say it I was gonna lol!
---
It's pretty easy imo. Also helps the eve economy. Then again guess I dont care when it's free isk.
---
Eve offline simply polls the ESI API endpoint that CCP provides that gives a "logged in player count". I think that means you've hit the char selection screen, and picked a character, and that character is logged in - whether sitting in a station, or citadel, or in a ship in space.
---
Botters sadly stopped login in for a small amount of days before they fixed it by using some other methods, as planned.
---
I don't know why people are still thinking the blackout is actually raising the player count of Eve.
---
I think the problem lies in not enough of the older player base wanted to adapt to CCPs latest round of shit tactic ideas coupled with CCPs inability to attract a younger player base due to spending all of their money on other unsuccessful projects.
---
honestly telling someone that they dont want to listen to things and play farmwille in space instead is alot more civil than "fuck you you dumb spodbrain"  
---
one is merely implying that the player is unable to adapt and wants his carefree sandbox in null 
---
the other is just hurling shit on a CODE. level
---
@LotusCobra looks like your fucked boi
---
What are you referring to when you say he handled the brisc case poorly? Guess I missed this.
---
You have made a compelling argument. I think this is reasonable. Thanks for your input. I am 100% not sarcastic right now. I mean it. Thanks.
---
I'm sure that, when CCP's accountants report to management that they're losing money at a rate they've never lost it before they'll appreciate when Hillmar says "but /u/joecuster on reddit says adapt or die, retards".
---
Just account for the fact that a ceptor only has about 80-90 m3 of cargo.  With some fitting you might be able to squeeze in some more.
---
&gt; BUT now the number of player has dropped more.
---
how many of those where players and not just VNI bots (of wich there are thousands in all corners of eve) is to be seen, id say a good chunk of lost playernumbers is ratting bots going down and only a small fraction is actual players leaving
---
did you download all files? that's a check mark in the settings you can uncheck and maybe it'll go away I've never checked how big eve is tbh. never had an issue.
---
How could something that's not there support you?
---
You cannot deny that quite a lot of them were alpha VNI bots.         
---
We don't see omega player numbers that is quite important here.
---
Whenever I read about the GTFO module I have to laugh
---
Fixed:  to happen to you. Eve losing players never was, is not, and never will be something good for the game.
---
But keep convincing yourself though.
---
I did. But in all my years of playing EVE, the installation has always been like 12-20gb.
---
If you go ahead and look at the 1 year and 5 year trend you can clearly extrapolate a downward trend of logins from year to year. You can also see a pretty big dip for blackout and post blackout.
---
**Wow classic is coming**
---
Your login numbers know nothing of fear, the real battle for player attention hasn't even begun
---
Agreed. Gate guns should be removed.
---
Consensus is always going to be relative to a topic. But you're only going to have one or two sessions where you get to talk about the issues you guys as a group care about. The rest of the time it will be CCP talking to you.  That's why you need to choose those things wisely, and it's likely you'll get better traction if it's all stuff you can agree upon.
---
You want to push your personal agenda, do that at the bar afterwards with Devs you think might be receptive. 
---
It took 3+ years to get CCP to focus on fixing wardecs, because their own internal views were that there was nothing wrong with the system and it wasn't causing any problems.  Whenever you're fighting against an entrenched view, even if you think you're backed up by the data, even getting the side that's entrenched to be open to studying the issue is hard.  It won't happen if there's somebody at the table saying "Yeah, I don't think you need to do this," because that gives the entrenched side an excuse to say "well, obviously there are opposing views so we're going to focus elsewhere."
---
If you get into a two hour debate in front of the Devs about anything, somebody should pitch you in the ocean. That's the absolute worst fucking use of anybody's time there. This isn't a TIS interview.  You guys get limited time around the table, and you shouldn't blow it with nerd arguments. 
---
And yeah, I took credit for all the stuff I campaigned on that CCP did even if I never mentioned it to them - as I have told you before, there is literally nothing you can suggest to them that hasn't been suggested before or that they've already discussed internally.  It's fun to play politician that way, but don't drink your own kool-aid.
---
We don't need a super cap fleet to kick you out of your hole. Ask hard knocks.  :)
---
CCP need to stop wasting their time on outside projects and focus on EVE.
---
Yep, overall the game has been trending down for years, but fluctuating a bit depending on time of year (winter vs summer, holidays in europe vs the US, etc) but the blackout has accelerated a downward trend.
---
But we can. I don't deny there are bots in Eve, but thinking they are not back in yet is either incredibly naive or seriously retarded.
---
I'm boycotting Blizzard for a period of 10 years (which I started in 2015 due to my hatred of what they did to my beloved Diablo franchise with the whole auction house fiasco) so I haven't paid much attention to their bullshit lately....but when does WoW Classic come out?
---
/u/pandoralica
---
I believe some of the changes you propose would be excellent for the overall health of the game.  Namely those to timezone tanking, citadel defense mechanics and asset safety.
---
However, I can't help but notice that most of the ship balance passes you suggest are effectively buffs to Stukas, or 1mn AB cloakless bomber fleets.  Namely the following:
---
* Information bonus "Electronic Hardening" now also help against painting
---
* wormhole generators or “Quantum Flux Generators” (ihub upgrades) are now active no matter the indexes in system
---
* HAW-Guns are now polarized on titans (0 resists)
---
* Dromis and Sirens roles changed to damps and paints instead of point and web.
---
* Fighter  MWD cooldown now starts at the end of the cycle instead of the  beginning (20 sec mwd cycle then 60 sec cooldown instead of 20 sec then  40 sec cooldown remaining)  
---
Currently, you are arguably the most active, and perhaps effective, FC to use this fleet composition.  
---
From my perspective, stukas are able to engage most capital and subcapital fleets, or disengage easily if they're not.  They're incredibly mobile due to the chaining of the micro jump field generator, which allows them to dictate range indefinitely in any engagement and take consecutive bomb runs at less mobile fleet compositions.  The mobility the MJFG provides also makes them extremely hard to chemo -- an obvious 'counter' to frigate and destroyer fleets -- in the hands of a capable FC.  
---
Due to the combination of frigate and destroyer hulls paired with skirmish links and afterburners, they are extremely difficult to apply damage to reliably in head-to-head engagements. Many ship classes struggle to apply damage to them, while the stukas can project damage both in the form of bombs and torpedoes.  Because they're so nimble and unrestricted by mass limitations, they can use every wormhole for travel making them difficult to scout.  On top of this, because they are a cheap and readily available frigate and destroyer based fleet composition, even if the entire fleet is destroyed, you're only a few billion isk down.  
---
Do you believe that stuka fleet is balanced?  If you could enact balance changes related to it, would you and if yes what would you change?
---
So which exactly covops are we talking about here? I am a Minmantar so Cheetah for instance?
---
Imagine trying to convince the CSM to "do something" as if they have any control whatsoever and exist as anything more than someone filling a seat in a puppet court.
---
You deserve an award. 👍
---
Set the filter to exact match instead of partial match. Drag n drop the name.
---
Boom, only one result.
---
I agree with you for supers.  Though I dont think regular caps need an ehp nerf.
---
I'm more surprised olmeca no lifes EVE instead of joining antifa
---
Rather him damage goons or eve or whatever than causing havoc in real life stabbing bullies to death to thwart the patriarchy or something.
---
Bro, No.  that’s nonsensical at best.
---
T3ds and the “i’m too fast to catch” meta was made by ccp for the purpose of giving hunters an edge.  Period.  But that’s an ingame mechanic, i disagree with them being released that way and then being nerfed in the same coin.
---
That has nothing to do with giving offensive oppression, which is an entirely different angle in eve.  Svipuls being nerfed meant you couldn’t roflstomp while roaming with them as easily.  That’s it.
---
Needing the hell out of all things you want nerfed is for the sole purpose of you not liking people DEFENSING themselves.  You know that.
---
No, Stain is hell.
---
Perhaps. Its hard to do year to year comparisons though due to how much the overall player count has been dropping year to year. The Eve Offline website isnt the easiest to navigate either to pull up historical data to the tiny little drag handles on the historical graph view slider. I've been looking at the 36 hour chart every sunday, as they happen, to pull my numbers.
---
Stay strong brother.
---
This post makes more sense than the OP
---
Well it's certainly not 230gb unless there's a memory leak somewhere. Check the installation folders size
---
Logic hurts you i guess
---
August 27th
---
Path of Exile is what Diablo 3 should have been anyway, so I'm happy. Blizzard is dead to me.
---
In addition to this, there have been those banned in waves following the blackout. 
---
I wouldn't be surprised if we lost a small number of players, but I think that a large portion of these "lost players" got banned for bitting/rmt
---
I don’t mind HAW Dreads because they cannot receive remote repairs. This makes them easy to dunk with only a minor escalation.
---
Fewer targets in space ARE a problem.  But that too "depends".  How big of a problem relates to how much were they really targets?  It is my own feeling (and others may vary) that someone with a couple of AFK VNI alts is no different for the game than a VNI bot.  If they left because they can't play the no-loss krab using perfect intel then I won't miss them.  This used to be what HS was for.
---
&gt; First, let me educate you
---
reddit don't take kindly to that kind of thing, no sir.
---
The problem with Olmeca Gold are that everything is a Goon conspiracy against him. In his csm interview all he talked about was Delve and before he got elected everything he posted here was about Delve and Goons. If you alienate and throw shit at 20000+ people, some of them will not be reasonable.
---
Also don't forget CCP is also clouding the data by offering these free SP weekends.
---
Oh you could go on all day about the differences. Whats fair and whats not.. I've had the pleasure of living in a wormhole for over a year. Left due to the fact i wanted to get into capital warfare. But nul and wh have pro's and cons. You mention the intel, i fully support having that intel at my disposal. I'm member of Goons like it or not we crafted a beautiful defense system in delve with theta. At the click of a mouse an a lil whisper into comms a fleet of capital ships arrive to save you. Not possible in any other area the game but nul sec and people wanna remove that for there content. Why should this change, What annoys me is this system took years to perfect. If you wanna attack any of the big blocks, you should be prepared to face them on there terms. If you come in lokis thats your choice, we choose caps. Bit of a rant i realise...
---
I mean didn't hilmar say that he's willing to accept these losses to work on getting the game into a healthier spot?
---
*Adapt or die, retards." -Hilmar, probably
---
That's not how memory leaks work
---
So tomorrow. I'll be very interested to see this weekend's, and next weekend's numbers then. This weekend is a US Holiday as well, so Monday's numbers will be interesting.
---
Wait tomorrow?
---
Can at least one of your posts not be dumb

I'm just going to delete it and do a fresh install on the SSD.

I'll do a fresh install on my HDD too as a backup copy.

I didnt even vote for that Guy. He is only representing the community because enough people thought it would be a good laugh instead of finally voting someone decent outside of the big alliances
---
use windirstat to see whats actually eating up space
---
True, I guess I just meant it's creating multiple copies of large texture files or ever expanding files being downloaded to the install folder. I know memory leaks are related to RAM and memory allocation
---
yup how dare a games company even consider writing games or working on any code at all that does not have a direct connection to the game your playing.

At the rate Eve is losing players, it will be down to 1/2 the players pre-blackout by the end of the year, and no one will be playing the game at all by next Summer. At some point, PA will step in and say....yeah buddy, you don't get to be the CEO anymore.
---
I'm not convinced it killed botters Beacon, it certainly disrupted them though. As I said in the OP, I actually like the blackout personally, but I've seen the effect it has had on other people, and I think we're playing with fire here. I think an ideal solution would be to return Local to Null Sec, and allow for attackers to disrupt local with a simple structure (that is expensive enough not to be quite so constantly spammed). To me that represents the best of both worlds. You might even see entities jam their own space in order to lay traps. Plus, it matches up with the goal of giving smaller groups things to do to disrupt Sov Null.

Unions in Caldari space ?
---
I like this a lot better than either the asset safety bullshit or the stuff dropping. 
---
The only legitimate reason to keep asset safety is to help retain players who are away from the game when they lose their space.
---
Maybe. As as I said, the only way we'll know for sure is to keep looking at the peak-of-peak each Sunday.
---
here is our POV  [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/472583503](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/472583503)
---
What about a right clikc, "Report to intel" option where we get to set the specific channel in the main options some where and have that channel character specific.
---
You could then just right click some one on your overview and go report to intel and gave their name and system and ship automatically posted to your intel channel of choice..
---
As a work around for people having trouble with this tho, next time you see a red your first action should be leftclick and hold for a second and slide to show info, or right click and show info, this takes like a second or two from this window you can then get their ship type and their name to drag into your intel channel, its a few extra steps than it used to be but it works.
---
Thank you for the new playlist. The music is as large as space.
---
I would like to point out that 2101 players were banned in July for botting, account hacking, or RMT. [source](https://www.eveonline.com/article/pwp24p/monthly-security-report-july-2019)
---
while this may not 100% affect your peak-peak numbers it is something to take into account.
---
Another thing you must take into account is that Uni has been starting back up for American players (and possibly others) teachers and students will have their game-time changed as they work it around commitments.
---
I would like to see these numbers tracked through the total age of chaos and have CCP's numbers for accounts banned added to the statistics.
---
I ratt on a weekly basis in Stain. It is a good region for PVE content.
---
Just don't let it go above 0. It's a good idea but I don't think there's a need to for system to flip beyond being only null/low/high
---
time and effort. where’s the balance in a player losing resource gathering time/billions of isk, insane train time, to what? what equates to it besides equal force or better strategy? instead of trying to outplay, you beg for nerfs which is a trash game development. when they took local from null both hunters and the krabbers, both had to adapt in some way, yea it was more of a hit on the krabber but none the less a change the aggressing group vs the defending. not a cry to gut there ships and shit on there efforts so you have to try less.
---
Which I find hilarious because, look at how much worse the numbers could be if it weren't for the free SP events?
---
Also, I suspect that the contract with Hillmar &amp; PA says something about "MAU" or Monthly Active Users whereas an "Active User" is simply someone who logs in, not someone who is actually playing the game - as in, logs in and plays for 15+ minutes and logs out. These SP weekend events are probably JUST to get people to hit that login screen and press a button, which due to the way the contract is worded, allows Hillmar to count that person as an "active" user, despite that they simply collect their SP reward and log back out.
---
These events are simply to boost his numbers so he can get the extra performance bonuses he's due in October if he hits the "MAU" numbers outlined in their contract.
---
Why do I think this? For years, when CCP talks about their player numbers they ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS refer to PCU or logged in players - which is the numbers their own API provides us and websites like Eve Offline record. When Hillmar started quoting the MAU number it puzzled a lot of people who thought...MAU? WTF is that? Why does he suddenly care about how many players are active on a Monthly basis...OH WAIT...that's what his contract with PA stipulates.
---
This SP giveaway bullshit is simply to maximize the MAU so he can get paid.
---
I mean technically it's perfectly possible to self DOS by being retarded
---
reeeeeeeeeeeeeEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE \*GASP\* eeeeeeeeeeeeeeEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE \*cough cough cough cough\*
---
&gt;You balance that with resource depletion and regeneration rates along with ADMs, so, like mining and ratting is kinda shitty if ADMs aren't high, sov infrastructure or not, tweak the existing system.
---
And it's still easier to do a crop-rotation-like system.
---
You're forgetting that gathering resources is only step 1.  The other steps involve turning those resources into stuff, and that is not easy to move.
---
&gt;so you spend a weak cleaning up whoever the smaller entities are,
---
No, you need the space to not have anyone depleting it.  So you clear it out long before you use it.
---
&gt;After doing this grind for a few months, you'd find the next door blue space far more enticing.
---
The next door, *depleted* blue space?  No.  You go and shove them out, then you let it be fallow for a while.  Then you go mine it.
---
Gonna be so cool when the teather becomes active. All the undock gankers May have to learn how to PvP.
---
Oh, the tears will be awesome 😂
---
Yuri was one of the dick swingers the night before over him not being an FC. Last night he got his chance. Landing on grid and hearing the FC say they need to get their overview unfucked is unacceptable considering the bitch he pitched the night before. It was a fleet of FCs and officers from various organizations and it became apparent when we got into PH comms that this was Beeen fleet and the rest of us were demoted to F1s. But sure its my fault for calling out his admitted failings.    
---
Props to Yuri for owning up to it. I upvoted his reply.
---
I don't know from where especially Goons seem to have reliable numbers on CCPs revenues ... inside job or just pretending to be smart but you dont?
---
People were farming plenty in WH in dreads before HAW guns.
---
if it helps i had a similar issue recently and my shared cache was around 25gb, comparing with other people in my corp their shared cache was around 20gb as well so that seems like a crazy amount for yours. fresh install sounds like a good idea.
---
There is all-time in that picture.
---
This guys knows it.
---
They generally don't without a lot of support.
---
Botters aside, smaller groups will have access to large part of previous renter space if the blackout keeps continuing as is. It also makes being a spai and recon great again. The blackout is a small price to pay for the cancer its removing, and the only trade off is a few care bear that left HS to soon
---
Just updating it cause they are going to flip it. Look for new owners soon.
---
No idea but judging by the risk vs reward mantra I'd wager not as they want people out of npc stations.
---
in 7 and a half hours :D
---
&gt; At the rate Eve is losing players, it will be down to 1/2 the players pre-blackout by the end of the year
---
And you know what? Taken my experiences from 2013-2017, where we predicted that the changes that you all cheered for will halve the Logins from 2014 (50-60k), and what exactly happened that way (you all cry about losses since blackout, but the biggest losses in FACT proven by all stats since them was the post-Lifeblood-Slope), these predictions will not influence CCP that much. Neither will your doomsaying, live with it ... and ... "adapt or die" (citation goons 2017 autistic screeching)
---
Its common sense. If less people are playing the game, then less people are paying subscriptions or are consuming plex. People will let their subscriptions run out and not renew. People will let their plex run out and not renew.
---
How is this hard to understand?
---
It's a demonstration (of many) that he's not at all interested in listening to people opposing his views, or the problems his changes cause for people who do not play exactly like him.
---
It's not that people don't want to adapt.  It's that the changes actually destroy massive swaths of gameplay.  For example, the cyno changes make large cap battles literally impossible (BLOPs or recons are not going to be able to cyno in a super fleet on a grid already occupied by a super fleet.  So first super fleet on-grid wins).
---
And he doesn't care, because he does not like large cap battles.
---
His changes are also massively counter-productive if you want to actually reduce the power of the blocs or bots.  Because those two have the easiest time adapting to the changes.
---
So, in return for Olmeca having an easier time bombing excavator drones, CCP is making all of the "stagnation" problems worse.
---
Did you do statistical significance tests?
---
Reddit actually does allow you to block subs now
---
&gt;First, let me educate you  
---
&gt;To spell it out to the inept readers

&gt;While this doesn't give a comprehensive look

&gt;All of this could be a moot point and this trend is a summer fluke.

&gt;I have no way of knowing
---
lol okay
---
Hi Ackbad!
---
You say that but all CSM members work for the betterment of the game as a whole. Most of the things people complain about was criticized by them.
---
wow thanks... i wouldnt say it like that but yeah was about to comment that the only thing i do in nullsec is hunt really... havent mined or ratted in years and dont plan to do so anytime soon :X
---
the only reason (and i said that right at start) i want a compromise is that i want activity (meaning people in space doing things) so there is daily content for both playstyles (hunters and pve fanatics)
---
Same here! Obviously because the null-aligned CSM has done such a stellar job over the past 10 years to ensure their own (safe) gameplay at the expense of the actual game.
---
Scan it you fuckin retard.
---
A low number of pilots play actively eve online.
---
Yes, I too agree that we should cater to gameplay wherein a select few players sit outside of stations while playing other games, for the sole purpose of destroying another players ship (of which said player is likely a new one) in an attempt to obtain their possessions.
---
And you guys wonder why new players quit so often. Even doesn't need to be safe, but fuckery doesn't need to be this easy.
---
I've been trying to justify buying my own Maelstrom but I haven't found a good use case for it. It's a really cool ship, especially with the full broadside gun racks.
---
All these changes are good but they still don’t solve the underlying problem. That problem being there is no reason to take space on a grand scale these days. And if you do want to take space, you cannot leave your home without the threat of someone burning your home while you are away. Until there is a reason to fight we will continue to see the growth of the game slow and the number of people in space dwindle.
---
It doesn't take a genius to figure out how to kill them, but you're probably chasing them with a super or something.
---
How dare he try to grief a null entity! 😮.  You would probably prefer he join CODE and try to run new players out of the game.
---
Isn't there a storage limit now? 1k unique items
---
Two questions... how many of those players gone are afk ratting VNI alpha accounts? How many of those are bots?
---
Login trends are the same, but I think CCP is doing a good job trimming the fat. I don't think their overall income loss is that great. I give them applause for thinking of a better community before their bottom line.
---
You literally haven't lived in nullsec ever if that's how you think things are. POS always had a timer window and didn't have to be defended instantly. As for asset safety there was always a type of safety as stations never were destroyed so your stuff was always where you left it. 
---
Additionally are you implying there are no hostiles ever in space, because all the major blocs lose ships every day in their space. New players are not getting constantly suicide ganked either. Maybe watch where most losses are in space and you will see its  nullsec.
---
Nah dude, the guys not logging in are the alts or dude with 10 covetors or carrier ratting alts. Most of these guys paid for their sub with plex from mining or ratting. They didn’t buy plex as much as the avg pvper. The guys that came back to the game, like myself, buy plex, subscribe 2-3 accounts, and don’t mine or rat almost ever. They’re making just as much money or more from this blackout. With me coming back, I told my friends and they came back. It’s probably very similar for other groups of players that didn’t play anymore but talked. 
---
Why this is good for miners and ratters: with plex prices dropping and less ppl mining it’s going to drive your income from pve up and the cost to sub your accounts less which will mean more money. You can already kind of see this in the market. You’ll be ok. Just keep insuring those covetors and mining those moons.
---
You’re mostly just losing alts.
---
Idk where you’ve gone but I’ve been on a few gangs where we fought something at zero and not even the pds went active
---
That's one of the shittiest way to reward loyal players and equally shitty for you to think of this. Nullsec population accounts for more than 50% of all active accounts and many of us are long time players. Me myself have played for almost a decade. 
---
It's one thing that your petty hate for us doesn't account for the things we do for the game --- huge fleet battles, industrial basis and logistics that keeps the game running and attract a lot of players in the first place --- and another if CCP also thinks like you. If it does, then we will GTFO, but CCP will have no one to blame if the game dies. No, it's people like you that need to drop your irrational hate of nullseccers and realise pissing off 50% of your player base isn't a good idea.
---
also drop containers and anchor them in systems around your roam area in null (maybe at some hub systems). they never expire and are basically unreachable if you plant them at safes not between celestials. 
---
then when you feel like you have enough on you come back to the closest dropoff and drop loot. 
---
once a week do a sweep in a cloaky and collect loot. Exit to hisec through a wh, contract your loot for hauling, profit.
---
Provide a way for players to activate or maintain more ansibelex or the gates themselves and stop charging players fees, sounds good to me. You happen to forget this would completely lock any hunter out of our space.
---
But are they back in the same numbers? I highly doubt it from the activity in null.
---
Could be, yeah. Those alts help pay the bills though.
---
This is interesting. I've had similar problems, but in my case it was my EVE installation becoming a cancer, eating all my free time and my money.
---
Then it's just NPC nullsec minus bombs and doomsdays.  
---
&gt; -10 highsec gankers also dont give a single fuck about their sec status.
---
Well that's an entirely different problem that needs to be fixed.
---
I was sarcastic 😀 but yeah i dont believe in us paying concord to maintain our gates.
---
You are right the main reason stukas are so popular is that they are mobile enough and you cant just jump in a few haw titans and blapp away (i believe this is a good thing)
---
However i have also been countered by smaller subcap fleets before and its less the shiptype than the tactic/strategy that is important here. Basically im saying stukas are just seen as op cause they are the only shiptype that can stay on grid with supers and titans (to some degree).
---
* Information bonus changes would help all subcaps vs. caps
---
* wormhole generators arent needed for stukas, we can get whereever whenever we want to be honest cause our wormhole crew is fucking ace :)
---
* polarized titans would still have 5-10m EHP and would receive enough repps to be unbreakable by stukas (not necessarily by other shiptypes tho)
---
* dromis and sirens are a problem for every other doctrine but stukas can actually boosh out and disengage
---
* fighter mwd cooldown is basically a bug and i believe thats how it was meant to work... they are uncatchable by any subcap doctrine and thats ridiculous
---
so in general those changes would help most other subcap doctrines more than it would help stukas and to act like "im a titan i should be able to kill anyones fleet without risk even if its 200 ppl" is this new annoying attitude i am not a fan of
---
i could make an argument to say no to you.  to argue it has a purpose
---
but truth is....it really doesnt matter to anyone. like you said, not even -10 highsec gankers care.
---
the only people who do are those who dont understand security status, and then get surprised when police shoot them.   they typically aren't gankers in highsec. and most are just new players who were in FW for a few weeks to learn pvp.  nasty surprise when they learn about security status.
---
so yeah, either remove it...or alter it to actually matter(by affecting those its supposed to, not the innocent pvpers) and not punish lowsec pvp

---
I'm not sure I follow you on how the Magic 14 is a false clue. I don't think it's necessarily a cause of new players not doing anything, I just think that at the end of the day it's very similar to what learning skills were back in the day. Learning skills took time away from training your next ship or gun (sure the points eventually got you ahead, but that was a long time out). If the Magic 14 affects every ship, then why not just make our base stats that way? People could then spend time unlocking new things, and not worrying about running into fitting problems (at least not due to lack of Magic 14 to 5).

Oh yeah, it's all about the bonus. I'm curious to see if he cashes out after October.   I'm hoping so. I'm getting tired of the whole "let's throw stuff on the wall and see what sticks" approach.
---
So you are saying "hey just gamble cause i got lucky once!"... and if i dont get lucky my gang is dead and nobody even had to undock... yay what great content that is
---
Salt drive. From Nullsuckers' tears
---
Ccp’s bills? And I should care how? I’m not subbing to a game that every time I try to get content the enemy docks up because they see me load into local and they’ve alrdy clicked warp before my screen even loads into the new system. This game was super trash pre blackout. You had to rly go to lengths to get fights. Now we’re over here cloaky camping gatecampers and getting 3 way fights with escalations thrown in and having a blast.
---
That's a real good point.  Brave for example, used to have a big push for newbies to get into ewar because even a character a few days old could help shut down a battle ship.  Titans/rorqs really changed that dynamic.  So while there may have been a large influx from B-R and similar fights the retention was probably more due to subcap fights and the feeling of importance even as a new player.
---
&gt; At the rate Eve is losing players, it will be down to 1/2 the players pre-blackout by the end of the year, and no one will be playing the game at all by next Summer.
---
[And by the summer after that, there will be negative 34000 people playing!](https://xkcd.com/605/)
---
Eve classic when
---
If you haven’t taken a trip through highsec lately I suggest you do before u make a statement about the number of bots. They are 100% still around just doing other stuff. The big question is with the bots still here who do u think the lost accounts are?
---
New players need more activities that are as easy to get into and profitable as exploration, nothing else they can do even comes close and that's rubbish. 
---
Alot of them tell me they want to go and pvp but feel like they can't afford it without grinding for months first or selling plex and since pvp is the main draw of the game that's very, very bad for retention. 
---
They need more SP early on too, they've buffed this a few times I know but it's not enough. (When I first started playing, with the Base SP and learning skills, I subbed for 3 months, set up skills and then played something else... I wouldn't do that today... I'd just quit, too many other good games)
---
 Faction war needs a buff so why not tidy that up a bit and funnel new players into FW via a tutorial that actually explains a bit about how different frigates fly, let them try some out, ask which was their favourite then give them the SP to be half decent with it and point them to FW corps, who shouldn't be able to shoot each other in hisec because that's yet another barrier for newbies, they need to feel they can retreat to somewhere safe at least until they can get flying with gangs.
---
FW should be a big thing for new players, a place where they can learn the game, make isk and have fun at the same time without incurring crushing loss or feeling like they are just cannon fodder for vets. Why are we directing them to eye wateringly dull missions or even worse shipping them off to null where the only option is to afk mine in a venture while you play something else till you can fly a myrm so you can play something else while you afk myrm? It's no wonder people are leaving for other games when the best strategy half the time is to play something else!
---
The game must be incredibly intimidating for a new player today....I don't care that I earnt my SP by going uphill in the snow both ways, I'd just rather this game had more players.... give new players the things they need to get in a community and in a *real* fight ON DAY 1 and retention will surely soar.
---
Blackout hasn't made me not login at all. I still login and play just like I normally did with no blackout.
---
The thing is that I got jumped MORE while ratting with no blackout than I have currently with it.
---
So nothing is different from a keepstar and a deathstar pos except someone has to be online for the keep, also one of the kills our gang got was a delve cyno orca, we were there for a solid 2 minutes and nothing from the keep
---
Reduced player counts, reduced jump counts, reduced player kills these stats are all down, people who only focus in the market are not seeing the bigger picture.
---
We are going to have to agree to disagree that ccp is developing a good game, this is hilmar throwing changes against the wall.
---
You know what... im actually up for the discussing this point but originally the idea what you can see immediately who has been in system for 5minutes
---
Run a verify run on your shared cache. It purges extra files.
---
You find it in your launcher at the top right E icon -&gt; shared cache..
---
YOUR MOM GAY, BOOM ROASTED.
---
no matter the reactor ... they are all fueled by tears
---
Awesome explanation!  I'm curious how they explain drag bubbles within those warp mechanics, if you happen to know :)
---
That's a check that defends people that PvE in low sec.
---
I was simply quoting the number that CCP themselves reported banning in the latest MSR, loot at the source before you get flair baited.
---
as for fly around HS, I have. I used to drop an AFK orca in ice belts to make isk (I still do on occasion to get ice for fuel)
---
and I'm not saying that bots are gone, just that 777 accounts got banned directly for botting
---
We pay concord for a lot of things, why not let us pay to run the gates or at least supply them without resources they currently lack.
---
Hahaha yes tether is awesome, hahhaha.
---
Vni bot are now mission transport bot in hs so it should be almost same number of bot.
---
how would you know you fucking krab?
---
*make Ochre valuable*
---
I seriously doubt that their ideas for chaos will be to allow supers into J-space. As for bashing in J-space, I'm aware you guys just recently lost a farm hole, how did that go?
---
If communities were the draw of MMORPGs no MMORPG would ever take off the ground, starting with Ultima Online.
---
i get your pov but i believe not all the guys that want to dock when you are 5jumps out actually get to do that and might end up as content anyway. On top of that its more people playing the game which comes with a bunch of benefits overall.
---
&gt;In fact, we in J-space have been largely laughing at the salt that has been accumulated in discords and this subreddit, We laughed at Mittens over the drifters and blackout, we laughed at Afk miners over the roving trigs, and we laughed at everyone over the cyno changes.
---
It is ok, we laugh at you for being wormholes btw.
---
wtf are you taking about? Super tics in green space won't cause any problems at all.
---
I havent heard this one much from feedback Ive gotten from Low-Sec residents.  Is this a widely shared opinion?
---
&gt;osha
---
triggered
---
I just have settings maxed out besides AntiAliasing, and high resolution. I hate the way AntiAliasing looks in this game so I keep it off.
---
Losing a skill in the T3 isn't so bad, as long as you aren't dying in one every day you can catch back up quickly.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXkABEg-miQ
---
&gt; if CCP ever implements costs on storing assets.
---
Yeah, I hear that comes right after fuel and bringing back paying for clones.
---
I blame Zap OutSpace for this mug of sweet sweet Carmel flavoured Salt
---
Spacesniffer might be your friend.
---
crap, I forgot to add that to the sign off.
---
One sec, editing
---
This is obviously working and based on this success I can only advocate you do the same thing to CCP.
---
Good luck and godspeed.
---
Not saying you're wrong, but your entire theory revolves around this MAU thing, as if it's some unusual term that recently just showed up. MAU is standard industry jargon in many industries, not just gaming...
---
Also, earnout clauses tied to specific metrics are fully intended to be gamed... that's the point, they want to incentivize certain behavior. Viewing Hilmar as some greedy guy just trying to get paid is exactly the point lol
---
Well another option has been raised that skills could have injector returns tied to their training time multiplier, so even 200mil+ vets could inject a full 500k sp if it was put towards basic skills, and even a 1 day old toon would be injecting &lt;100k per towards titan or jump drive skills.  However, this would require a rework of the whole system we have, where you let sp sit in a pool (I often let as many as a million sit in case I need to inject some obscure skill before an op).
---
Really, I think we should see 2 tiers, the first being the alpha clone restrictions, and the second higher tier being injector restrictions on individual skills.  This lets new omegas and anyone looking to rapidly cross-train pay to jump ahead, but it wouldn't allow mass injection of those advanced ships that win fights and break economies.
---
I'm not sure if those free SP events really impact the figures that much. Someone logging in just to grab the free SP is only going to be online for a short amount of time before logging off again, so any statistic that looks at concurrent users (which is what Eve-Offline does) isn't going to be affected much by these players.
---
If we assume that someone logging in to actually play has an average session length of 2 hours and someone logging in to only click the claim button on the character selection screen is in and out in a minute, then it would take 120 people doing just the SP claiming to impact the concurrent player count in the same way that 1 actual player would.
---
Holy fuck what a retard, gj pointing this.
---
LUL also highly likely
---
All that has changed is now theta can respond once the first volleys are fired. Even with the cyno changes, which I agree are a bit overboard you can still respond with all of theta. It’s not like theta were ever going to save subcaps regardless. I was a goon once too.
---
&gt; I think that means you've hit the char selection screen, and picked a character, and that character is logged in - whether sitting in a station, or citadel, or in a ship in space.
---
If that assumption is true, then this figure doesn't include people hit-and-running the claim button on the character selection screen.
---
Das what I'm sayin
---
Wowie is this today's "Eve is dying" thread?
---
I mean I'm fine with that if you buff my 4b Kronos so it can solo 2 carriers or dreads at once, I mean it costs more than them so I should crush them right?
---
Lol supers into J space. Unrollable  holes. If these are the ideas put forward just delete Wormholes and fold everyone into the blobs. At that point there wouldn’t be much difference. Let’s keep narrowing down play styles to high sec and big bloc shall we.
---
I don't think so either, probably because some were probably "casual" botters or something. But people tend to overestimate the number of bots in Eve jus because someone said there are a lot of bots.
---
Stukas are OP because they can delete any fleet that gets within 40km of them that isn't a capital, while also countering capitals and having the mobility to easily get within 40km of any fleet.
---
welcome to the dark side, cloak and hood is over to the right
---
Look at the 3 month concurrent players on eve-offline then look at the minimums on the graph. The minimum number of players that are logged in is a couple thousand less than before blackout. You can see it dip immediately in July when the blackout started, then recover slightly.
---
There was a post on reddit like a week ago that he is starting a new company with previous CCP owners.          
---
It will be more like **see you guys and thanks for all the ISK**        
---
As ISK is actual Iceland currency.
---
What changed (or will change) with bumping in HS? I haven't seen anything, anyone has a link for me?
---
by sending thoughts and prayers of course!
---
I'm super down for titans to be bad at anti-subcap if they were better anti-cap. More targeted DD damage (bring it back to 2.5Mil) and buff capital gun damage
---
It's great, I'm playing a ton and I'm getting 100+ kills per month. I don't even do whaling. I love the blackout
---
Beautiful!!!
---
Hint: Most likely, They just got transitioned into HS and LSFW bots.
---
And with less income per account, The owners are scaling things up further.
---
Really it's the first and last ones there that get me.
---
Eve-offline counts the number of characters logged in, not the number of players logged in.
---
&gt; Perhaps. Its hard to do year to year comparisons though due to how much the overall player count has been dropping year to year. 
---
You could establish the percentage decrease of player count in the summer compared to some pre-summer month (say, May). While absolute numbers may have changed, it's fairly reasonable to assume that the relative reduction in player count due to summer isn't going to be massively different. Compute this reduction for a few years to get an average and you have a baseline trend to compare with.
---
&gt; The Eve Offline website isnt the easiest to navigate either to pull up historical data to the tiny little drag handles on the historical graph view slider.
---
That's really the main issue. I don't know if the raw historical data is available somewhere, because that would be much easier to handle than the very limited views offered by the website.
---
what if i dont care
---
Sure it is not, but you need 2 webbers, 2 bubblers and  a lot of time to hunt for this 150mil frig.      
---
Quite often this will not help you much as they spawn in system with a station.        
---
So guy just come in a ceptor, change ship, do 4-5 missions he chained in system (2min each, different spot) then warp to a insta dock.                 
---
No you cannot get him on station as people use dscan.
---
Nobody write this for you because nobody likes you bruh
---
I think wormhole space has already gotten some chaos adjustments. My hole now has on average 6-7 wormholes in it every day!
---
&gt;First they came for the Crabs in Sov/Null space and we laughed,
---
&gt;then they came for the AFK-Miners in High and we laughed,
---
&gt;but then they came for us Wormholers...
---
My launcher stopped working so I'm dormant until it updates itself or something.
---
The actual players numbers is +/- the same. All the logins you lost since Blackout are bot accounts.
---
So, Even with lesser numbers of loging, you could have more real players.
---
Bigger part of eve is destroying other players ship.    
---
Like i don't know what you are trying to point out now.
---
I'm curious how much of this is related to botting issues and summer/back to school trends.
---
this will be hilarious
---
&gt; so ccpls..what in the name of Bob, is the point of this sec status shenannigans? 
---
The point is that people who constantly attack people all the time can't go to areas that are considered under police control, unless they spend the time (killing npcs) or money (buying tags) to get a somewhat good reputation again.
---
The area where you are not punished for shooting each other is called wh or nullsec. In lowsec and highsec, these actions have *consequences,* which is totally fine.
---
don't argue with that guy, he's literally economics-dumb and has no concept of supply &amp; demand
---
Eve is about massive fights and smugglers trying to squeak by the warships and make off with some isk in the middle of a battle is a valid career path. It sounds like you would enjoy elite dangerous or no mans sky more that eve. They are both great game
---
Nah, why should they? If you attack someone you lose sec status. You filthy pirate!
---
Only shoot criminals and suspects. Abide by the space law :P
---
do you think SnapChat is a good investment? asking for a friend
---
Well they definitely don't get to do it now and the only thing most of them contribute to is inflation, even if I catch one of them their friends won't come to help, they'll just watch him burn...I guess that's content, but only just. I'd rather there were half as many and they undocked to fight, that would reduce inflation making it easier for newer players to replace these plebs.
---
I don't have a link handy, But the long promised 3 minute timer is on the way.
---
The 3 minute timer ensures that you can only be bumped or be caught against geometry for a maximum of 3 minutes once you click to warp, Once the 3 mins has ticked, It forces the ship into warp and ignores what it is bumping against.
---
I believe it's the change that was posted on SiSi a couple days ago where if you've been attempting to warp for 3 minutes then you'll enter warp regardless of your speed. Meaning if you can't be killed within 3 minutes then you're safe. Bumping isn't going to stop you from warping.
---
and we laughed... Or atleast I am.
---
Where do you think plex comes from?
---
Great, now I want to know the anchovy to beef ratio so I can try it.
---
Good job. Something I would like to know, but that is impossible to tell :
---
Is there really less "active" player or just less bots farming ? Because if it's just less bot I don't mind.
---
what are you even on about? you're rambling like a crazy person at this point
---
A TRASH TALK THREAD THIS WEEK FEELS REDUNDANT AFTER [THIS](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cvb10n/jinterviews_olmeca_gold_on_csm_141/).
---
When someone comes to attack you they probably won't have the required standings. You sit there in your brick tanked bait ship tackling them until a massive response fleet spawns on you.
---
Don't worry, once you get the install figured out it'll just become a cancer eating all of your free time, too.
---
No eve is different. If that causes players to leave then eve will be dead
---
Easiest way was something promised a long time ago suspect timer upon entering Plex solving the issue entirely while still applying security decrease to gatecampers as it should.
---
Ugh, that's a well reasoned boycott. Check out classic though, you don't have to buy anything other than the sub. I think it's gonna be something special
---
APPARENTLY YOUR "A" KEY WAS KILLED THO.
---
You mean the wingy bits?
---
Oh yeah obviously there is plans in place for the cyno changes. Its the lack of ships that can fit the things now is the huge problem. An the costs of them. At alliance level it's not much but to an individual just looking to move around it's become hard.
---
Everyone looks at how these changes effect the big blocks they adapt much quicker than the smaller blocks. Go for a roam around nul sec not just the bot regions. There is a lot less players. Of course if we had local we would be able to clarify that lol..
---
I'd find it nice if the fleet window had icon elements next to each player who is calling out something that needs attention which you can interact with instead of just a single line at the bottom.  i.e. just as you can see a UI element in the overview, you should see a UI element(s) in fleet next to each player if he made a remark to fleet.
---
That's not what your mom told me.
---
Sweet!!!!
---
&gt; dont give a single fuck about their sec status 
---
Then why change sec status if it really doesn't matter much. I think it's nice from a lore perspective and as a minor consequence of killing people who pvp there legally
---
I don't know how y'all find the mental or physical energy. It's exhausting just being an informed constituent
---
Sorry, I never understood RPers in Wow, nor Eve... yet alone took them as seriously in Eve. 
---
Wow has servers and places on servers, which makes you delete characters so fast it is not funny, yet it is;
---
Eve too? 
---
Yer killing me, bro...
---
botters are negligable since they fire up 5k new accounts - it's essentially the same number banned / created so we don't really have to account for this
---
wow, that's nice, thanks for the info
---
Oh you sweet summer child, wormholes are to safe you make waaay to much isk in there while safe because you can roll your wh conections and bring them to a critical state.
---
The glowing eye of \~\~Sauron\~\~ Hilmar has its gaze set on you. I wish you the same treatment we got and that we deserve so the game can be balanced.
---
May the balance be in your favour adapt or die, i look forward to saying when a new wh opens in DELVE : " you are trapped here with me" obligatory "reeeeeeeeeeeeeee"
---
September update.
---
Ever considered the possibility that you’re looking at accounts logged in and not players? Blackout has clearly cut any meaningful botting outside of very few areas and complex setups. It’s gonna take a while for these bots to be reprogrammed into doing something else than anomaly farming in nullsec. Tbh I’m genuinely surprised the slope is that soft and that there wasn’t more bots around.
---
You know what gets me the most about these kinds of people? Is they always say they didn't want to hurt the members. But really, those are the people who are usually hurt the most. 
---
Not saying that the end result in this case wouldn't have been the same if the fort had been fully fit, but it's still funny when traitors say that.
---
Dude if you're unhappy with your corp leadership, just walk away. You don't need to backstab everyone. It's just a freaking game, stop being butt hurt about it.
---
Same here, 5-7 Holes on average
---
There's alot but I'll be brief: 
---
New players should be steered towards avenues that let them figure out their own way in eve. Don't tell them within the first few weeks, let alone the first few minutes, to join a player corp. Set them on a path to learn about the game and explore. If they just join a player corp, they will likely just end up being told what to do rather than learning anything. They are also more likely to quit than a player that decided to join one on their own. 
---
Cloaking is just too powerful, but I'm not sure the correct way to handle it. You need to either make it not perfectly safe to be cloaked, or reduce the intel someone can gain while cloaked... or both.
---
Capitals as is are not the problem but the speed in which capitals can be brought to bear. A capital ship engagement shouldn't be the go-to for everything, but then again everything shouldn't be able to GTFO whenever it wants either. We need ways for fights that happen to keep happening after one side decides to leave. We also could use something that keeps people from warping around to bookmarks. Ships that can't escape so quickly from a fight are ships that die. This is good for everything. 
---
Oh uh and hit point reduction on capitals is meaningless when bomber and t3 groups already pound them into oblivion. 
---
Any further loss in safey to citadels will just drive an already deep stake in to the activities of PVE players. Doing something to stop citadel spam is a good thing, but you need to ask yourself: Is the goal for your suggestions to get people to play, or to generate easier/better kills for hunters? 
---
On asset safety, how many players who took/take a break and come back to find everything they owned except maybe a single ship they were in gone... and actually keep playing? We want player retention, not short term pvp gains. 
---
For your actual questions: 
---
Needing parts to repair structures or ships doesn't mesh with your idea to reduce hitpoints. We need logi to stop acting like medics and instead just mitigate/reduce incoming damage while providing minor repairs. Hell, we also need fleet formations and aoe weapons, and to do something about the game being "Alpha him, now alpha him, and now alpha that one"
---
Changing docking abilities for caps as a method to get them out of npc stations isn't the best idea. A docking fee for your capitals in npcs stations, however, is much, much better. 
---
I could go in greater detail but I just don't have the time. Your goals as someone who is trying to solve CCPs problems would be:
---
New player retention
---
Incentives for players to be out in space, which feeds into generating pvp content
---
Small group activities that are worth doing, we need less of "Just blob up" 
---
Make fights that happen, happen longer as destruction is good for the game and the players
---
Force projection needs to slow down, but so does the speed in which hostiles can pounce on a target without that target having time to request and get backup. Do you want fights or free kills?
---
That's all I have time for
---
I mean the Judge didn't have problem joining goons. There's always someone retarded enough to take these backstabbing assholes in.
---
That's .... disturbing.
---
I mentioned literally none of those... I specifically don't want un-rollable holes.
---
&gt;If you want to hit how we roll wormholes, consider that it is an  important factor in how we find content (or how content finds us). DO  NOT REMOVE IT.
---
It's Parrot who rocks; I'm just the messenger because he doesn't do reddit. :P
---
See above.  PLEX comes from CCP.  They can give it to the nerd in exchange for $.  They can give it in a package, they can use it in a promotino.  The receiveer can then do with it what they please (within the confines of the EULA).  They can sub with it, buy skins or extractors with it, sell it on the market.  
---
The person who bought the PLEX and used it to sub did not give CCP any $ and they did not generate the PLEX.  If CCP determined it had become too easy to grind for a PLEX, they are free to nerf that part of their game.  That too has ramifications.  But one thing remains true; Subbing your account using PLEX does not generate $ for CCP.  It is at best only generating an in-game demand for PLEX.  It is, ironically, diminishing a real time demand for PLEX if it means less PLEX is bought becaue the in-game value is too high.
---
Dorothy Zigger is a nice lady you better treat her right okay
---
It's extremely easy to burn out.
---
Um. A bit too sarcastic for my Monday. Look at the history of failed CCP projects and money wasted. It is almost as bad as the government in terms of wasted money on failed projects.
---
Doubtful, level 3 missions are worse in every respect.
---
What's a "battle ship"?  I keep seeing mention of these things and there seem to be skills and ships on the market for these things but I have never actually seen any!  ;)
---
&gt; i dont like to be punished for doing pvp in a pvp area
---
same, but i don't only get sec status decreases but concord also comes to kill me
---
Yes
---
There are enough ways of PvPing without sec losses that you need to bring it to lowsec. It you don't like it, large swath of nullsec and W-space are available.
---
What would lowsec be with your change? Null without bubbles?
---
This is sound advice. I had the exact problem the OP did, and a windirstat report allowed me to track down five separate eve cache locations, each taking up dozens of gigs. I ended up uninstalling Eve altogether, then nuking each of the cache locations, just to make sure.
---
No. If you call a corp to defend and they are in an alliance then the whole alliance must declare its support for the defenders.
---
probably not, 2 carriers and 1 dread are about 6 to 7 bill, and if it’s a haw dread then it’s like why would you even try? you’re out numbered and out gunned which is literally what happens when a titan gets popped/dropped, so what’s your complaint again? not having enough friends to help you do the job? not sure how to? or just looking for an easy button solution to your personal problem while under valuing the next guys effort.
---
Lmao.
---
Plex costs money. Therefore it generates money for CCP. If people didn't use Plex to fund their accounts, there wouldn't be demand for plex and therefore people wouldn't buy it, not generating money.
---
Just because CCP very rarely hands out plex as rewards doesnt make it lose value. The market is mostly unaffected by that. Its only sales on the purchase price that lower prices on plex.
---
This is Extremely simple economics here. It's mind blowing to me you don't understand this
---
You have not shown that less people are playing the game.  You have shown that less characters are logging in.  I went from 8 accounts pre-Blackout to ~3-4, but I am actually playing more than I was before.  Before, I would AFK 5 Rorquals and play another game.  Now that is a good way to feed.
---
I feel you. I'm pretty competitive every season :D I've got a few demigods from racing
---
It makes it pretty much impossible to use the same character for casual lowsec-daytripping-PVP and keep using that same caracter in highsec (e.g. for Missions/logists, NPSI fleets, basing from highsec becomes needless complicated...). It's a tax on behaviour that you'd want (more people dipping their toes in accesible PVP in FW low), which feels very stupid.
---
The suspect-on-FW-beacon would help a lot already, but I'd rather see the sec hit removed. Gate guns/sec loss for podding are fine as-is, IMO.
---
Sure it s worse so they need more bot :x
---
Just curious, what exactly is the approach you would like then?
---
" -10 highsec gankers also dont give a single fuck about their sec status. " so that counters your point completely.
---
Yeah I get it that most people cant code, and have never written or worked on a game themselves so are totally clueless when it comes to what its really like, so I understand your view, you're wrong, but I get it..
---
Triple A Developers start projects all the time and then can cancel these projects all the time even after years of development and money is spent on them, and for the most part the community playing their games hardly hears anything of it, CCP is a bit different in that they talk more about this, they don't stop more projects than other developers their just more open about it.
---
Look at Blizzard, people think the sun shines out their ass but they have started and then stopped work on some epic projects and they just vanish without anyone ever getting a look at them, CCP on the other hand show what their working on so when they cancel something we know all about it.
---
You mean the group that actually fought? The one that sent an unfit cap to act as a damage sync instead of SD'ing half their assets on the undock? 
---
Shit talk POSPY for being C4 lowlives but they fought harder to defend their home than most of the other major wormhole groups.
---
Then again... armor rattles. You might have a case.
---
beacuse im NOT a highsec ganker, im just the average pvp pilot, joining public roams and all that. so why punish the casual pvper? pls explain?
---
I figured, thanks.
---
Could be not approved yet.
---
Was that on the alpha sign up list?
---
Maybe just wait until the apk leaks
---
Well, I'd leave local as it is. Include cynochanges. And then limit the number of Building orders per system again. That massproduce capitals in like no time at all is a problem.
---
Was in the middle of hacking a superior sleeper cache... and it disappeared on me. All of a sudden, I was just in empty space. I was in the turret room, and hack just hacked the sentry repair station and was waiting for the sentries to be destroyed. Why did it disappear? Does a timer start after your first hack and if you take too long its disappears on you?
---
ahh, i could see that work.. thankyou for this information...
---
Anyone willing to make this a google music playlist? :)
---
I remember when I first started playing Eve I wanted to visit Jita so bad thinking it was going to be some bustling marketplace. I hope we get that feel now
---
Not sure if bait, sarcastic, or just a legit happy dude.
---
Until you have contrary evidence...
---
Yes this mostly affects people like me who go to FW Lowsec to PVP and don't join a militia. This way I have twice as many targets.
---
It's a small annoyance to me as it means I'm not allowed to fly any ship bigger than a destroyer in HS. It also doesn't make sense as people PVPing in plexes is the intended gameplay. Not being a part of a militia doesn't give me any advantages over the locals currently it only incurs a sec status tax on me.
---
Good for you!
---
Congratulations on 100 Million Skillpoints LuluHottum.
---
... which in turn, use up propellant.
---
Is worth of materials destroyed didn't change.
---
I mean this very thread proved olmecca doesn't want good faith arguments and resorted to name calling instantly.
---
As an example.  
---
Pre-Blackout:  AFK'd 5 Rorquals while I played r6 Siege, League, or another game.  Occasionally PvP'd when I had the mental energy to deal with the toxic roaming environment created by almost perfect intel and super umbrellas.
---
Post-Blackout:  Very rarely if ever multibox because it's not worth getting Excavs bombed.  PvP with 1-3 characters and generally enjoy every roam even if we die in a fire.
---
Result:  Less characters logged in, but I am actually at the keyboard when I play now.  I put in more human hours than before.  The game is healthier.  The game has a brighter future.  As the CEO of a large corp I am hopeful for the future where I was getting fed up with CCP before.
---
...what?
---
Are you really saying that the MMO part of MMORPG is not something anyone wants?
---
"we'll see" is the right answer. All this spitballing of numbers, building off of assumptions and decrying eve is dying because one visible number changes is all pointless.
---
CCP is the only entity that has accurate data. They can see how many players are active, how many alphas have stopped logging in, how many RMT'ers or bots they ban. Even the free SP thing is hardly something you can point at as "they're fiddling with the numbers" because CCP has been doing free SP stuff on a regular basis for months before blackout too.
---
Wait and see. Don't try to make an "analysis" on assumptions and incomplete numbers. If the numbers are indeed too bad, you'll find out from CCP, this "i know better than CCP this is bad for the game" that has been common on reddit is frankly just ridicilous.
---
It's really satisfying to hear and see when every gun fired.. Like pirate ships at sea shooting cannon at poor victim....  
---
I've been using it for L4 mission, with arty fits. Snipe everything from 100km+, with MJD for emergency..  
---
But I didn't know any other, just started playing eve, only doing missions for days...
---
The modern media would be proud of you.
---
You're clearly not very imaginative
---
Yeah, I said corps of worth
---
Does your analysis account for the additional bans? I'm looking but not finding it....
---
Dear /u/Olmeca_Gold,
---
If your example of a reasonable response is you quoting one of your own responses as 'reasonable' where you literally talk about a 'farming simulator' and 'You derive your Eve sense of worth by what you own' I think you make it very clear why people might feel you start with the incivility.
---
People don't like it when you diminish their playstyle to 'Farmville Online'. It makes it sound, probably correctly, that you feel their playstyle is inferior.
---
prove it
---
This article was created by Fomol Grosstraktor, praiser of the sun, from Brave
---
You mean the only thing you are good at?
---
Aether Wars isnt run, coded or even funded by CCP. So far all they have done is announce the 2 tests to us. Have Hilmar ramble about cloud tech for an hour and gotten some ingame artist to swap around the default colors on some skins. Something that probably took all of 5 min per skin. But you keep complaining abour how 3 skins recolors are slowing down the games development.
---
Just going to point out an inconsistency.
---
Is sec status hits "useless" or something that changes people's behavior?
---
bots fucked off to hi sec real players went to play something else cos stealth bombers online is fucking boring
---
I mean, if you want guaranteed fights where the other side doesn't get to choose to take evasive measures or respond.. pretty much any single player console game will give you what you want.
---
UwU &gt; Sun
---
Ok...
---
&gt; It's definitely not a farming simulator.
---
Open with an insult.
---
&gt; If many playstyles aren't viable then only the dominant playstyle keep subbing and playing the game which is where the current stagnation is coming from.
---
Not understanding how people will adapt to the changes (hint: Null blocs and bots have the easiest time adapting.)
---
&gt; Null is actually full of laws and mechanics that ensure the balance
---
And the laws of the people who built empires there.  Which you seem to think should not be allowed.
---
&gt; CCP Did that by allowing empire builders to theoretically stack half of the null in a single region and make farmers virtually immune to attacks. I argue for a change to that
---
Without considering it a "valid" play style, so anything that you think harms it is a-ok.
---
Funny thing is everything you propose makes it harder to live in null without being in a bloc, and only slightly harder to live in null within a bloc.  So what's gonna happen?  People migrate to the blocs instead of things like the current land-rush in Vale.
---
But you'll be able to bomb excavators more easily, so full steam ahead!
---
&gt; If as CCP you give people license to farm safer than hisec as long as they have the largest blob of ships then you disrupt the balance and make people leave and unsub
---
This is also known as "Nerf cooperation!!!!!!"
---
Also, the "people leave and unsub" argument works both ways, and I've yet to see anyone provide statistics showing that losing 10 krab accounts is better than losing 1 person-who-wasn't-as-elite-as-they-thought.
---
&gt; PS: I do krab. I am richer than many of the titan owners in a generic mega empire. 
---
So what's your proposed changes to eliminate the near-perfect safety of your krabhole?  AFAICT, you haven't quite proposed hurting your cash cow in the name of content.  And, btw, we kinda noticed this disparity.
---
All I can see is a slope that started in 2014, with the exception of the bump in 2016, the slope started back again after.
---
I bet they say this is the reason for our tax increase. So that ccp could get isk to add the expansion to jita 44
---
How many of those users convert to money I wonder... 🤔
---
Okej, the "also" bit gave me a different impression. To me the world must make sense and it seems odd that an area with security status above zero wouldn't have consequences. I mean if you observe how intense highsec gets about illegal pvp sec drop is fairly relaxed. That said I get it's annoying having a very red sec status for high sec, been there a fair few times, but personally I prefer that as it makes the game feel more believable
---
&gt; Ccp’s bills? And I should care how?
---
I'm absolutely pro blackout, but this might be the dumbest thing anyone's said on this subreddit for several days. That's quite the accomplishment.
---
I believe so.
---
I wouldn't say get rid of it entirely, but maybe limit it to actions on grid with npc structures that would "report" the hostile actions, or something related to density of actions.
---
Like shooting 1 dude a week doesn't give any hit, but smartbombing 10 pods a day will knock you down.
---
We never seem to have problems getting fights with null sec people. The blackout works both ways.
---
thats exactly the point. theres NOT enough pvp contetn in wormholes and nullsec, especially now with blackout and half of nullsec krabs moving to highsec. 
---
so people chose tama and co, to get some kind of content. desperate times.....
---
what is lowsec currently ? right 0sec without bubbles and shit highsec punishment.....great. not.
---
BRB, need to fire sale all assets.
---
Why do you care about ccp money?
---
That makes sense. Anchovies increase the "Umami" or savory flavor in what they are used in.
---
Adding that to a burger makes it much more flavorful. I use a 1/10 (anchovy/beef ratio) by weight, and it works pretty well. Don't use salt in the rest of the mixture and you should br good.
---
What is the balance like?
---
Like at zero, casually running how many missions is the same as shooting a nerd in lowsec?
---
Nobody of value was lost
---
" getting sec loss for killing some nerd running escelation in lowsec, doesnt get that nerds ship back anyways, it also wont prevent people from killing nerds like that...i just dont get it. sec stat loss is so frigging useless :D "
---
so nope it doesnt defend those people from a shit ;)
---
your argument is invalid .
---
lol nice
---
Hardly relevant, if you log in just for the rewards, you won't hang around to make a mark on the concurrent online players chart.
---
low sec residents probably dont give a shit about it either. they use highsec alts for highsec stuff. or simply fly ceptors and use instadocks ( like every sane person would do).
---
Watch chaos come in the form of wormhole stabilizers that allows connections to last longer than an WH RF timer.
---
Thots n prayers 4 ur lots
---
No. Lol
---
Destroyed by l33t PVP.... 7o lads, last person in GE- turn the lights off.
---
UwU.
---
If one of my comments refers to a conception of Eve as a farming simulator this doesn't make the comment uncivil. It's just a fact that some people play this game mainly to acquire assets but there is more to the game than asset acquisition.
---
I didnt say 2 carriers and 1 dread, I said 2 carriers or 2 dreads... they are usually just short of 2b each therefore my ship costs more and by your logic I dont need friends to kill them since my ship costs more and should therefore win,  you say a titan shouldn't need support because it's expensive, I say that's dumb and you should bring friends to support you to reach your full potential, and you counter with I should bring friends so my more expensive ship can defeat cheaper ones? Why do I have to bring more people to fight cheaper ships and you don't?
---
XD hehe ya . random disconnect while landing on a gate in 0.9 or such..generates funny lossmails.
---
I did it for years, if you don't pod non  limited engagement people and rat on the go you can keep over -2 very easily, without needing to exchange tags...
---
they could do that both ways, more mining = less and less valuable rocks. ADM 6 meaning an enormous completely made up of dark ochre and veldspar.
---
Aww shit, here we go again
---
^(praise the :sun:)
---
Molten salt reactors.
---
Since when is interest in the game been a bad thing? More viewers, leads to more interest in the game, leads to more people trying it, leads to more people subbing.
---
This is what spod does to your brain :(
---
CCP needs to buff anom payouts to match the increased risk of blackout ratting.  That's a fair trade IMO, and will get people back out in space to interact with.
---
I don't really see how it makes sense for it to be asymmetric.  Blackout as is already punishes inattentive krabs, and I don't see an argument why gank targets should be trivially easy to find.  On the flip side, why should people who have been cloaked up waiting in a system for 5+ minutes be obvious?
---
Symmetric I could see being OK, but ships with cloaks fitted would probably need some special rules that would probably make it hard to pull off.
---
explain your lazy effort reply pls.
---
 tldr, yesterday when saving ihubs in feyth, i just wrote randomly PL is dead aliance into local, and received salty email from PL leadership pointing they whored on a brave blackbird killed by rats  
---
the sperg continued and he kept posting me killmails he was not even on, like a boosher or t1 frigs
---
So you're the person who bets like $0.25 and is still scared to lose. 1m isk is like Jump Bridge tax money.
---
Forgive me if I'm wrong, as I haven't played in a while, but isn't it possible for someone to scan down your cans with probes? Seems to me like there's an added risk of someone ninjalooting your can by the time you get back for it.
---
Perhaps you believe it is much more simple than it actually is?
---
There are multiple factors going on and unless you know the #s you don't know which is more powerful.  And only CCP has access to even the most basic #s (like PLEX sold and PLEX redeemed).  If you think you know what is going on then you are probably wrong.
---
I am pointing out the complexity.  That even if you knew what CCP knows you don't know what would happen when things change.
---
For simplicity:  Let's say a lot of PLEX appears because there are 100 of some type (let's call them an Alpha-nerd) always subbed their account with a CC but doesn't like to Krab.  Maybe they did early in their EvE carreer, but they got older, they now make good money coding for a Silicon Valley company or a bank, whatever.  They still like blowing up other nerds in spaceships.  
---
For this example, on net, they burn through 2 T3Cs a month worth of isk.  Prior to our current uberkrabbing meta a PLEX was 800 mil and they would have to sell 2.5 a month to pay for a 1 bill T3C.  Now they have to sell only about 1 a month for the same 2 bill.  Or maybe less because the uber-krabbing has reduced the value of a lot of materials.
---
So CCP makes less off of PLEX sold.  The Alpha nerd who buys it doesn't need as many because the demand by the uber-krabber increased its value by both bidding up its in-game iskk value AND by krabbing even more materials to buy more PLEX (in-game) but thereby reducing the value of assets in isk terms.
---
There will still be demand for RL buying of PLEX from CCP for $ when the value goes down.  In fact, CCP might perceive that there will be MORE buying of PLEX at lower values, hence why Hilmar sayed that PLEX got to high in isk-value.  Or maybe when it was lower more newbs joined thinking it was possible to pay for free?  I don't know.  
---
I have said a lot of times I don't know which of the vectors is the correct one.  I only know one thing which remains true;  If you aren't giving CCP real $ to be an Omega, your "sub" isn't that of the actual customer.  The only real customers are those who give $.  That doesn't mean you aren't a necessary tool to attract paying customers.  But don't kid yourself that "subbing" = customer.
---
literal cnn fake news goonpost
---
imagine being a tapi pet lmaooo
---
Sounds fine.
---
Characters logged in is what consumes plex/subscriptions.
---
You're right, sorry, missed the "of worth" part. I stand corrected.
---
how about this: you dont want to get shot? then dont go to lowsec , nullsec, wh space...oh you are greedy and want max isk, but no risk ..sounds like half of nullsec krabs who cry about recent changes and moved to highsec mission running now.... ;)
---
You forget just how many bots are out there
---
Yep. I said that though...
---
YOUR DAD LESBIAN
---
Nuclear Saltwater Thrusters are an "possible" thruster type.   And they're deadly epic with thrust that "starts" at 5% the speed of light .
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_salt-water_rocket
---
The difference being that most of those companies that have been developing for a couple decades also have more than one success.
---
Your claim is that fewer people are playing based on eve-offline stats. But eve-offline doesn't actually count the number of players, only the number of characters.
---
Bots were always in high sec.  Do you have some proof that the super capital bots are now making diddly in high sec?  I find that unlikely.  In addition, the average high sec person is going to look like a bot because they literally click a rock and wait.  You do not have their reaction to your presence to make the determination like you do outside of high sec.
---
When all you have going for you is your washed up space guild; words hurt.
---
Dear CCPls, could we finally get rid of sec status losses for doing pvp in highsec, pretty please?
---
that shit is useless. i don't like to be punished for doing pvp in a pvp area.
---
if people are reduced to only shoot suspects and criminals..there would be like only 20% of the content in highsec. so what's the point?
---
getting sec loss for killing some nerd running refuges in highsec, doesn't get that nerds ship back anyways, it also won't prevent people from killing nerds like that...i just don't get it. sec stat loss is so frigging useless :D
---
people only use that game mechanic to their advantage on stations and gates ( god i hate this gate/stationgun dumbshit so much)
---
only -2 lowsec gankers give a single fuck about their sec status.
---
so ccpls..what in the name of Bob, is the point of this sec status shenannigans?
---
TLDR: get rid of sec status losses.
---
EDIT: removal (of concording) might be a bit much to ask for, but change that shit in some way. PLEASE.
---
are you not enjoying local being added to WH space?  
---
For real though, if they make mass changes I really hope its published. Its been 3 years and people still think there are 3 billion mass XL wormholes.
---
A pretty shitty bot if you ask me. That line works when "playing" results in total annihation and permadeath, nuclear winter style. The only mechanic in eve that results in permadeath is biomassing, which is only possible through a player's own decision.
---
So is this gonna have RW aspects like construction delays and cost overruns?
---
Please explain how a super capital bot operates profitably in Blackout???  How does it deal with a perma-cloaky in its system?
---
Their "fix" was basically using much less profitable ships and feeding like soup kitchens in the hope they make more than they lose.  Bot eyes on a gate are a great way to attract attention and tell me what system to log a hunter off in, lol.
---
&gt;this also makes wormhole ratting in higher class wormholes way harder and more annoying, because those can really only be done with a HAW dreadnought or several battleships.
---
This is fine.
---
Oh for fuck sakes, another 'concerned citizen' upset that null now has an element of risk befitting the easiest krabbing lands.
---
Nullsec gameplay has become vastly more enjoyable for literally everyone except those multiboxing a dozen Rattlesnakes or carriers.
---
Yes and no. You're not wrong that the behavior is expected and incentivized, but these kind of contracts are also popular for unrealized revenue (which also seems to be the case here). Like say, a new FPS game you have in development, or perhaps a mobile game in alpha? The issue there would be that, in this case, the FPS failed out pre-alpha, and the mobile game is still unrealized revenue and honestly might also have issues of its own relating to its perceived value at the time of the contract. Which means that if you evaluated your total value based on realizing those revenue streams, and that did not come to pass, then the PA deal relating to something like a 40-50% total value payout based on future realized value becomes a smaller and smaller target for you to hit as the time to finalize the payout structure draws closer.   
---
I dont blame anyone for performing their fiduciary responsibility to their investors, the question is, at this point, is that what is actually happening?
---
I'd prefer them to address the issues in the game via a thought-out strategy,  rather than them saying "hey what if" and trying random things.
---
My wishlist:
---
Local continues on delay mode in 0.0 and WH space;
---
No more asset safety;
---
Depletable resources;
---
Insurance at 0 for ships lost in combat vs other players;
---
Limit to the amount of citdels a system can have anchored;
---
No cap damage for citadels;
---
New sov system;
---
New sov system...
---
Everyone constantly seems to think WHers are the type to scream over inconveniences... yet I never see it..
---
Oh look another goon crying about the blackout. I am so shocked at this unexpected turn of events.
---
brave still had blackbirds?   we've been out of them for 2 weeks.
---
Docking request denied due to construction. Estimated completion 23.08.19 downtime.
---
imagine playing this game lmaooo
---
&gt; His changes are also massively counter-productive if you want to actually reduce the power of the blocs or bots.  Because those two have the easiest time adapting to the changes.
---
I hate this arguement, of course the biggest groups in the game will have the easiest time surviving change, because of strength in numbers and all that. Because some change will affect a large group very little compared to others, doesnt mean that it shouldnt happen at all.
---
All good ideas, now if only low-powered structures didnt have an rf timer
---
The sunesis is another pretty good option &lt;2s warp and 1250m3 cargo bay. no nullification though so ping off of stuff
---
Imagine having a c4 corp lmaooo
---
uh....remember that launcher?   yeaaaaaaaahhhhhhh....its gone
---
we got a new one. more informative,  bit harder to get used to.  arguably faster than the old one.   but nostalgia might be blinding me
---
They created a launcher, but why exactly is a lagging launchet your biggest problem when playing a game
---
Nobody here is blaming you, not sure why you are so defensive.
---
I'm just providing additional input. I don't think it's fair to blast him as a "big dick swinger" when he was the one done dirty several times over giving his opinion on what we should be doing during the entire operation. And to be quite honest, what he said needed to happen the night prior is basically what ended being decided, but it could have been a worse outcome since it took so long.
---
I blame our current educational system.  Too much indoctrination and not enough tools taught mean they just aren't trained well enough to make an argument.  Or write well.  or both.
---
When I went to school (back when we had to walk both ways, up hill, through the snow, after having had a bowl of rat poison for breakfast)** we were given tools.  We were even expected to defend well opinions an arguments counter to our own. 
---
**  If you don't know the reference (and no, it isn't verbatim, just the gist) then for shame!
---
If you give me one I'll promise to double it
---
No, it clearly isn't. No sec status punishment to militia members inside plexes is a totally valid request, but OP is just wanting to delete a system with various implications without having a fucking clue what he is talking about.
---
Not being welcomed in HS after shooting non-criminals just a few jumps away is logical, and tbh you need to do a lot of naughty to get below -2, which is usually easily compensated by running missions or killing belt rats.
---
Besides that, you can use Clone Tags to get your sec status up, and there is a whole market around that. OP is just being a cheap fuck.
---
Shhhh.... !    The Narrative!
---
It ended up being a misconfiguration.
---
You're wrong. You are forgiven.
---
~~amount of people~~
---
amount of alts (who exist because EVE was boring)
---
&gt;Blackout ends but local is forever changed. The local counter is back but the system takes up to 5 minutes to recognize who is in system (30 seconds per -0.1 security level).
---
&gt; The security level in nullsec is now organic and will be higher the more NPCs are being killed in the system.
---
Clear boost to botting and enanced security for large coalitions with super umbrellas since most of the system would be in 0.0 sec status.
---
Got my invite 2 days ago, but I got an OnePlus 5 :(
---
hats off to you guys and bal for having a gf, ama is always a system full of pew.
---
is that like SpaceSniffer for losers?
---
*looks at concord*
---
*hides baseball bat behind back*
---
And FAX where made to be so much better. It is not as much of a nerf as you think it was.
---
When I'm sitting on a gate I shoot the rats to get back a bit of extra sec status, does that count?
---
Ah I see. Glad to hear no foul play was exercised
---
All the people still playing the game and adapting as usual instead of crying like spoiled brats in the forums.
---
From their discord:

---
It means you shouldn't shoot yourself in the foot.
---
Goal: Null not as dominated by the blocs.
---
Change: Increases power of the blocs.
---
If you actually want to achieve your goal, you shouldn't make that change.  Instead, you need to take a look at what stops smaller groups from taking chunks of null, and address those issues.
---
And no, the #1 issue is not the blocs will kill you.  Goons and Legacy, for example, do not care who's moving into Vale and are not going to do anything to stop them.  PanFam appears to only care in as much as they don't want people tied to Goons and Legacy.
---
just delete eve
---
Your idea is retarded and tries to solve a problem that doesn’t exist by introducing some weird clunky sequence of events
---
Content will find you when you come into a well populated nullsec region. So much content!
---
In fairness to CCP, we got here (here = pre-blackout, VNI nerf, etc)  through well thought out strategies.  Perhaps they went to some deep-thinking team building session and came out of it saying "we aren't very good at that, let's try this!"  
---
I am not saying it will work....  But they are trying things actually recommended in some form in the past that are also executable with minimal coding necessary.  WE ARE NOT GOING TO GET HIGH-EFFORT changes (meaning coding).  We just aren't, no matter how great the idea.  
---
We also aren't giving it any time for the changes to take effect.  It has been at best 5-6 weeks since BO and cyno changes haven't taken effect yet.  The VNI nerf was probably a necessary one.  (Sub Omega and get yourself an Ishtar if you miss AFK VNIs).
---
never once did i day a titan doesn’t need support lmao, every fleet comp has some sort of logi ewar and or links, i never said anything against bringing a fleet to take down a bigger target. i’ve simply said nerfing something you can’t deal with is not a solution to your person problem. try not to twist what i’ve said, it’s not complicated
---
I can’t believe I’m replying to u but here goes... no u.
---
The rest, when they shortly return after their nostalgia craving has been sated.

This makes too much sense and therefore can't possibly be true!!

It's not even that by the look of it. He wanted to go evict the biggest group known to do evictions in wh space, without even having a plan.

Shitting on all of the people he had called friends.

Eve is a beautiful game
---
Still going to be hunting them ice belts. *shrug* doesn't seem it will be much of a change. Carebears gunna carebear.
---
Let’s rub two brain cells together and realize what’s gonna happen. Probably a decent number of people will be playing WoW classic today, this week. This was going to happen regardless of any changes in Eve. 
---
Within a week or two many of those players will stop bc the grind is terrible. 
---
Plenty will still play WoW classic for the late game raids, and will still play eve.
---
The ones who leave to play WoW classic for good (which I don’t believe will be many) were going to leave Eve as soon as the next shiny thing appeared anyways.
---
WoW classic will have no noticeable long term effect on eve.
---
It's not though. Look at the left wing on gila and rattle.

I’ll have you know Toni is THE best lvl 2 mission runner in the game

What Arether Wars is foing is pulling CCPs focus away from the only game making them money and your attention from how shotty they have done the past few years.
---
The responses you get will merely fit someone's narrative.  The truth is no one knows yet and it is possible for two parties to be correct;  That not all the drop in #s is bots, that a lot (ALL?  unlikely I think) of bots moved to HS, that real live players stopped playing the game (at least through the launcher, because there are a hell of a lot of those still playing via reddit) AND that there is more fun and mayhem currently than there had been.
---
&gt;Also, character logins don't matter all that much since we now have alpha accounts.
---
Well, those matter. Before alpha accounts existed the login numbers were higher than now with alpha included, and the trend is constant downwardswith some (event-)peaks.
---
EVE is a dying game, and cheap and effortless changes like disabling chats or tweaking stats will not be enough to stop this.
---
NOOOO!!!
---
I sense a tone of sarcasm
---
It won't be long before Orion Sa-Solo has **YOUR KILLMAIL ON HIS FRIDGE!**
---
When undocked, please add "fit to ship" when right clicking on a module in your cargo when the ability is there (i.e. next to a depot).
---
You think all of the carebears in eve are going to play wow classic? And stay there? They are two different games with different audiences. Yeah there is overlap, but not a full overlap. 
---
And the pvpers will hunt other pvpers. That’s the only reason they hunt rafters and miners majority of the time is for the pvpers to come fight them. Or for the tears the bears give.
---
Real PvPers?
---
&gt;Ccp’s bills? And I should care how? 
---
Do you think CCP's servers run on positive thoughts?  That their bandwidth bill is paid by fairies?
---
Orange Dev is bad man!
---
If that was true we'd have gone plaid by now.
---
Commenting and upvoting just because you pulled a scene from Charlie Wilson's War.
---
It was a last nail in my eve experience coffin )
---
What were those changes?
---
Krabs are quitting because of the blackout???
---
In other news water is wet.
---
CCP have repeatedly stated they dont give a shit about short term quitters. Anything is better than the serenity clone tranq was turning into.
---
Those are called Ghost Site
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Ghost_Sites
---
is this satire
---
Your comment is really stupid because everyone, even the spod sniffers want to win and be isk positive in game with as little losses in a fight as possible. Some losses are always cool but any group taking any fight is going to have the objective to kill as many as they can with as little losses as possible. And by the way, I didn’t make any mention of losses. Just fights and escalations. Do cloaks make you salty?
---
If that’s what finished it for you, you should probably just stay away.
---
Eve has been dying every year since I started playing. The meta has never been worse than since rorquals were given a reinforcement timer.
---
\- Claims to have not seen less people are playing the game.
---
\- Proceeds to show everyone less people are playing the game.
---
It doesn't matter if those 8 accounts were "alts".  CCP got paid for them.  They're now making \~half as much money from you.
---
The can cannot be ninja-looted, but it can be blown up if memory serves correctly.
---
Hilmar probably "I do so enjoy the sound of the bleeping sheep.."
---
As long as you don't need that extra pg or cpu.
---
&gt;Nah dude, the guys not logging in are the alts or dude with 10 covetors or carrier ratting alts. Most of these guys paid for their sub with plex from mining or ratting. They didn’t buy plex as much as the avg pvper. 
---
I have an exciting timeshare opportunity for you.  And your statements regarding economics indicate you would be a fantastic customer.
---
Synthwave Underground (by the same user, apparently?) is also very good:

---
You stopped playing wow classic a long time ago.
---
Why would you think it'll suddenly keep you busy now?
---
*  Comment is stupid.
---
*  Calls people spod snifffers.
---
* Asks if I am salty.  
---
So... tell me again who you are and why your opinion matters?
---
Yah that’s why there’s a blackout. So they can make more money and stimulate more content. Rorquals that make 500 plex worth of ore per 3-12 hrs of mining aren’t paying subs and thus their accounts aren’t helping CCP. Most of these crabs are the ones leaving.
---
Totally agree.
---
It discourage people comming to low sec for fights. 
---
Specially newbros, which is a sin, let them shake and fell the adrenaline.
---
Disable totally.
---
Or only punish in such places where a turret is watching/shotting the offender, so Npc stations and gates.
---
LS Locals, we often doesn't care or even see such status as something cool.
---
The thing is the current "trend" (way too short to call it one) is quite a bit worse than the longstanding downward trend.
---
No need to talk about all the bad decisions CCP made over the last decade, the money they burned, the layoffs, injectors, rorqs and alphas.
---
Everything they did lead to shorttime hypes and peaks, but if you look at the numbers from 2017 until today, there is a clear trend.
---
So much this. I ask anyone that shit talks someone like that to step up to the mark and try and organise the entirety of a home def op. It's herding cats. A whole lot of shit and sifting through contacts, diplos, doctrines, plans. All for a game so they can try and save your sorry assets. All without being podded out and more.
---
Shut the fuck up Krab
---
Personally, I think we need to keep it going at least a few more months. Let's see numbers during Eve's more active months.
---
Also, if there are an average of a thousand-ish less players daily, it may not be active players but bots not being used. They would skew numbers because they are often on the entire Eve day. Their absence would affect the average every hour of every day.
---
I absolutely believe CCP will return local at some point. Going back to the old way would, IMO be a bad idea. If we must have a local, let's give it a few minute timer when first entering system. For the first 3-5 minutes, the new pilot cannot read local but he would also not show in local during the timer.
---
This would give the guy a chance to sneak through a system without bothering anyone or he could hunt for a few minutes and maybe get lucky or unlucky.
---
In other words, a delayed local in truth as well as in words.
---
Actually, it does make it uncivil because you call these people 'Farmville Online' players which to them insults their playstyle. You are basically calling them names, which even if it doesn't sound so to you might be considered an insult by someone else.
---
And people who play this game to acquire wealth are perfectly entitled to play the game that way. You might not agree with that playstyle but calling someone names for playing the game a certain way, with the connotation that we know for you it is something negative, is uncivil.
---
Which tribe had Olmeca on/near the top of their ballot, exactly?
---
How many alts do you think he has?  Enough to get elected on the first pass?
---
My man right here. I couldn’t agree more with this. Eat sleep welp repeat
---
Amen.
---
Citadel Patch and Lifeblood Patch just as the most obvious examples
---
i think the caladri should get their 2nd ewar before trigs get anything
---
thinking you can't play both at the same time in current year smh
---
You can't probe it down though. That's what he was asking.
---
&gt;Rorquals that make 500 plex worth of ore per 3-12 hrs of mining aren’t paying subs and thus their accounts aren’t helping CCP. 
---
Are you interested in buying a Timeshare?  Perhaps a bridge?  'cause your economic insights here indicate you'd be a fantastic customer.
---
Less sarcastically, all Rorqual accounts are paid.  Either directly through subscription, or through Plex.  Even if the person running the account buys Plex with ISK, CCP got paid cash for those Plex.
---
So the people multiboxing a crapload of accounts are/were helping CCP.  Quite a lot more than a solo hunter.
---
This is basically statistics 101 done wrong.
---
Correlation something something causation
---
I'm not someone who does, but there are tonnes of people who do it in Eve. Hell one of the biggest news sources in the game "the discourse" are role players.
---
It makes the game interesting for them...it is after all the beauty of the sandbox.
---
Plex prices are dropping hard meaning the pvpers have to buy more plex to replace those expensive ships they fly. And those expensive are only going to get more expensive as more crabs quit playing.
---
Please don't give them any more ideas to create awesome new mechanics later to be iterated upon(TM). I think CCP is quite busy right now with iterating stuff that exists now.
---
how to tell someone is a millennial or gen z
---
you mean Spacesniffer is windirstat for losers, windirstat is a whole 6 years older
---
one of the few changes CCP got right.   It actually did what it was suppose to do and not everything else also.
---
space OH&amp;S
---
they have been playing housekeeper for a while now... they recently said they are ready to start building on the future and personally this idea would be neat... though i do appreciate the sentiment...
---
What does a new revenue stream being realized or not have to do with EVE's MAU numbers?
---
Also, if PA set up the earnout to be tied to MAU only that would be amazingly hilarious and good for Hilmar for gaming it. Fun With Contracts!
---
Hi, you must be new here.
---
PLEX isn't created out of thin air. CCP earns more by someone PLEXing then by someone subscribing. If you would like to see the math behind it there are multiple posts about it here on Reddit.
---
Good question, no idea. I might be off there, I stopped running missions when I started to do PVP, because PVP was exponentially more fun.
---
I really hate the idea of making the game harder for people who want to do PVP in such an PVP oriented game, regardless. A single mission would be too many, IMO.
---
\~i can neither confirm nor deny\~
---
I like to use [https://retrowave.ru/](https://retrowave.ru/) There is also a apk floating around which allows you to install on your phone while also allowing you to download the songs. Site also works great using a phones browser.
---
The whole point of an Astero is that you can fight *and* explore. Or explore and fight, take your pick.
---
Typical fit is dual rep (small and ancillary) in the lows and a scram in the mids. You’ll probably also want a cap booster. Take a mobile depot and flex nanos in the lows and web/analyzers in the mids as needed. Oh, and blinging the small rep makes you hard as a coffin nail.
---
Covert ops boats will not fuck with an Astero and usually won’t stay in the same system with one. The fear factor is real, so you get sites you might not otherwise. Even cruisers have to be careful fighting one. I got dropped in one by an Arazu once and would’ve won if I’d have been cap-booster fit. Everything went tits up when my ancil ran out of paste.
---
The only downside is that an Astero isn’t quite as good at actually running the sites as a CovOps. But when you’re exploring in neutral or hostile space the ability to shoot back is worth the risk of a blown can here and there.
---
I agree with all of your points except the last one. I think the effect the blackout is having is far greater than we want it to be. Maybe it isn't that bad in Delve, but certain groups have fallen off a cliff.
---
I'm also not sure that the reason we're seeing small groups begin to proliferate is due to the blackout. I think a lot of things have happened in the past few months that contributed to that, like NC/PL being kicked out of their space.
---
Also, I wouldn't identify null sec farming as cancer really. It was a problem that they've over-solved. It also wouldn't be a problem even at the old levels if there was a significant turn over in capitals, especially super capitals. What we all want (I think) is for more things to die more often, but also for it to be easy to get back on another iron horse and get back in the fight. Right now the situation in null is pretty nasty (which is good), but not worth it risk wise outside of the biggest super umbrellas (which is bad).
---
Another way to put it is this: everyone knows runaway inflation is bad. But since we don't often see deflation, a lot of people don't realize that it's just as bad if not worse. People end up stacking up at zero in a deflation scenario. Another thing you don't want is an economy that is more than 100% efficient. What that means is that you end up working harder and harder just to stay in the same place. I think the old status quo in null was similar to that (though probably not technically 100% efficient or above). Super Capitals were being proliferated, more people were mining and more Super Capitals were being proliferated. Without enough turnover, the prices of minerals tanked, the prices of Super Capitals tanked, etc.
---
The problem with putting Wormhole local into Null is that they are different geographically. Wormholes have natural barriers to escalation that cannot easily be overcome. In Null you can come and go as you please. So either Null needs a massive buff to the point where people don't care that they're losing caps out grinding, or you need to pump the brakes on some of this Wormhole stuff.
---
What I would like to see is a game where if you put the hours in, the average joe can get fucking rich. Rich enough to flaunt some bling around and then lose it in a fight. But also risky enough that blingy ships out trying to strike it rich are getting nailed on a regular basis. We want people to go "you know, it's dangerous as hell out there, and I need to keep my wits about me, but man, if I go out there I'm going to get fucking paid."
---
Local good, ccp bad
---
&gt;I'd prefer them to address
---
The lack of unicorn ship skins? I mean when the full cash out is done, all bets are off on how the game will change.
---
The explanation I saw was that the Warp Drive tries to warp to a specific point where there's a known mass, and when it gets to that point the warp bubble breaks and the ship returns to regular space. Interdiction spheres kinda fuck that up and act as an alternate point of mass that pulls the bubble into breaking in the wrong place.
---
... Unfortunately, this explanation doesn't really explain how arbitrary Bookmarks work, since there's no mass at their location.
---
Roll back
---
My understanding is that banned bots are usually back under new accounts relatively quickly.
---
They start non-question statements with a preposition?
---
I said alot of this in another post, it's nice to know a real newbie picked up on many of the same things. None of this sounds dumb to a vet and frankly it should be obvious to CCP, especially the bit about getting you into a fleet that isn't going to gank you. Look into the NPSI fleets, they will get you in a proper fight.
---
A note on reshipping, you can actually leave a fitted ship in space and jump in it when yours is destroyed but everyone else can jump in it too! (If they can find it) 
---
 What you really want to do is set your medical clone near where you will be fighting and bring a stack of ships to that station (you can fit a few packaged frigates in an industrial) so you can reship quickly, if you are just going out roaming though not being able to instantly reship at will is a pretty significant part of the game.
---
Unhire
---
You actually get -2 pretty quickly especially if you’re fighting a fleet. A day of PvP is basically you losing 2 sec status
---
If you’re working in friendly space, by all means finish the site, don’t blue-fuck your alliance mates. 
---
On the other hand, if you go to hostile space, cargo-scan and cherrypick away.
---
Couple this on top of wormholer btw and fk me
---
How? Theres no reason to just shit on the wormholers right now
---
"DDoS attack" vs "DDoS oopsie"
---
Buy tags and take them to a CONCORD station, add some isk to it and problem solved, as easy as it gets.
---
It'd also be nice if their primary wasn't hot garbage to begin with, but y'know
---
&gt;  blackout has accelerated a downward trend.
---
If eve dies because it becomes more HTFU to play, then it's a good death. What scares me is Eve sticking around so lont that the only players AI grinders and a few die-hards. That would be a tragic way for them to go out, IMHO.
---
1. No idea. I think we would need another T1 BS first, the leshak doesnt seem like a good Blops, even if we T2 it.
---
2. Ill try real hard.

ONE FINGER “FEWER”. LEARN TO GRAMMAR
---
Well thanks for taking the time to write that up, it seems well thought out. I'll leave most of your commentary as is but I do want to address a couple points
---
Asset Safety
---
* Not sure if I was clear enough or not, but the idea would be to convert asset safety into something you do if you're going to go away from game. That would be the reason for manual asset safety only, and also the reason for having NPC keepstars in NPC Null. For those with super capitals they could stash them there (for a fee) and not have to worry about their assets exploding while they're deployed or traveling or trying to focus on their real lives.
---
* As for what the retention is for people that lose everything? I'm not sure, but from what I've heard the devs remark in the past, it's often a challenge that actually engages players, at least in the early game. I'm not sure what it would do to a veteran with some super capitals, but there's a possibility they might look at it as freeing them from baggage, a chance to start over. Of course, this is just anecdote, but I have a feeling it might not be as bad a thing as people make it out to be once the tears have been wiped away.
---
NPC Stations
---
* I like you're idea of a docking fee for caps. That might be a better solution! I'd say waive the fee for industrials though.
---
I didn’t get through the whole thing because Olemca was dodging questions like a political professional. I get to deal with that in my day job, so I saw no need to waste more than the seven minutes of a day off that I spent on this vid.
---
KITEY BULLSHIT IS COWARDS RUNNING AWAY
---
I've wanted a heat based Ewar for years. I think it would have to actually deal heat damage or it would be *super* niche. 
---
If reducing the time someone can heat is the difference between you winning and losing, almost any other ewar (RIP ECM) would be just as, if not more effective. 
---
In a fleet, unless you are targeting a large portion of the enemy fleet with these, it wouldn't amount to much. 
---
The biggest obstacle I see to making heat an effective and fun ewar type is adding in more balanced counter play. 
---
Things like:
---
 - being able to repair broken modules without docking/refitting. 
---
 - Being able to have quicker repair cycles or reduced-effectiveness repairing while a module is in use. 
---
 - Modules that give resistance to that type of EWAR. 
---
 - Remote assistance modules to resist the effects, remotely repair targets heat damage, and/or remotely reduce target's accumulated heat gauge.
---
They need to just add pvp plexes to null sec it would be a great sov mechanic that would allow null players to have something to do other then big fleets
---
no no no... we got here from well thought out strategies that were half-ass implemented - we warned CCP numerous times about the potential for shit to go sideways if they let a few of the changes through the filters but they refused to listen and now everyone is eating shit
---
That's a lore answer for a game design issue. That's nearly alway a bad answer, IMO.
---
It's a barrier and hassle you have to overcome to do PVP, and that's a bad idea in my book. It stopped me from doing more PVP for a while (that was before tags, though, IIRC). All it really does is add some couple million isk I have to pay when I want to keep shooting people. How does that help the game in any way?
---
Fleet fights happen more often now and they are more uncertain. I am having a blast right now. Also I saw good old friends return for the blackout which is amazing!
---
plz share killboard for reference
---
reddit is a cesspit, i know i am here...
---
Imo you should have to be in the war to slide a plex
---
https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99006690/
---
lmao you're so retarded it hurts
---
They're making fun of you cause you act like the average redditor mate.
---
In the short term maybe.
---
However, the ceiling for Eve is much higher as a hardcore space MMO than a theme park MMO.  Eve PvE is not better than other games on the market (I'm not a fan of WoW or the rest, but Eve can't really compare overall in PvE but is moving in the right direction).  By catering to those that just want to see the digits on their digital wallet increase as risk free as possible, Eve started losing the players that made Eve what it is.
---
Eve's most successful period could easily be still to come if CCP tries to compete as the hardcore space MMO it can be.  People are crying about a couple thousand characters not logging in, not people.  CCP should not worry about a couple thousand bots and multiboxers unsubbing when the future could be 100k online concurrently 2 years from now.
---
If Eve tries to be space WoW, good fucking luck with WoW classic coming out.  Eve cannot make the game as safe and risk free as WoW without immediately dying.  The people that Eve changed for wouldn't even stick around after all the content creators leave.
---
Okay bud 😉
---
CVA will soon be able to realize their dream of beinging highsec to Providence. :)
---
&gt;All citadels only have the initial reinforcement and another structure timer. However Large and X-Large citadels gain an additional Strontium armor timer.
---
Still too long. Leave two cycles for online strux. Give mediums 24 hour RF with stront, Large 2 days and XL 3 days. The only strux that need over a week to kill are oned worthy of that sort of attention.
---
&gt;Battleships get +0.5AU/s warpspeed and Battlecruisers get +0.25AU/s
---
Not enough. increase cruisers and above 1AU/S each. Battleships and BCs are too GD slow.
---
&gt; Dromis and Sirens roles changed to damps and paints instead of point and web.
---
I think carriers have been hit hard enough by now. They would almost be better off getting euthanized at this point.
---
I didn't see this listed but the voluntary loot movement mechanic needs to be deleted. Asset safety should trigger because of an event and not be used as an evac mechanic.
---
Honestly, I was thinking of this as more of an anticap/anti-primary niche in larger fleet fights... Functionally being able to remove a hard primary target's ability to overheat resistance/tanking mods was my main use case. 
---
Small gang example would probably be a few guys trying to work over a bastioned marauder or t3 
---
My implementations definitely not a short fight scenario.
---
............................................................you realize that "plex", regardless if purchased by 10 covetors or 10 \~elite pvpers\~ are still 10 plex purchased at some point by some party right? There is no way you are actually this dumb.
---
lol!
---
how many of your accounts are Omega status now vs. then?
---
&gt; WE ARE NOT GOING TO GET HIGH-EFFORT changes (meaning coding). We just aren't, no matter how great the idea. 
---
Is it really too much to ask for a **game development** company to do some, I dunno, **game development**?
---
All this is is randomly flipping switches in the game code in a desperate attempt at getting player numbers up enough to qualify for their bonus (without actually having to spend any extra money), and it feels like that kind of strategy- only thinking about the short term metrics rather than the long term health of the game, isn't good.
---
They'll be back after realizing that max level after grinding nonstop for weeks (9 days was my record) killing the same dragon and raiding the same 2-3 dungeons over and over and over and over really isnt that great. Nostalgia isnt a good way to hold an audience for any length of time.
---
Spamming dscan isn't a sure thing. People prescan sites and wait. 
---
Gate camp checkers aren't always up to date. You could be their first target of the day.
---
Lol what the fuck for? So you're 0.001% less likely to be interrupted while plexing? FW are worthless to me.
---
they pull information from the coding, hth
---
&lt;BATMAN SLAP COMIC&gt;
---
MY SMALL ALLIANCE IS DEEAAAAAD!
---
I think fw would be a great sov game in null you still would have the big epic I hub fight but you would actually have reason to have small gang and 1v1 fight leading up to it.
---
Where's the lie?
---
Hey, Sis White Male, not everyone is born with a  Gneiss Spoon in their mouths, okay.
---
"A planned safety test of the expanded reactor system failed catastrophically today, as thousands lost their lives and stores in the Jita 4-4 Explosion".  
---
Fucking dare you CCP.  Nuke Jita 4-4.
---
Yeah I'm all for CCP fixing it
---
No thanks. I did Classic the first time around when I was in college in 2004. I don’t need to do it again.
---
Chief ones would be the more NPCs being killed and defenders can choose the time, not the day.  
---
Super alliances can afford to have legions of carebears ratting day in and out, to drive up the security rating.  
---
Likewise, the larger alliances are less likely to be caught with a bad roll on the day where they can't get people.  
---
In my own opinion, there needs to be some mechanic changes to nullsec to make super alliances either undesirable or preferably, inherently unstable, so they can exist, but aren't invulnerable.
---
WORMHOLE MAN BAD
---
That's exactly what your first post says...that you shouldn't be countered by things smaller and faster than you....why not? Every other ship in the game is. You are the one attempting to twist this by saying I'm complaining about this "coz hurr durr you can't kill a titan" rather than because titans break all the rules every other ship class follows for no other reason than because they are expensive which was, quite rightly, thrown out as a balancing measure a long time ago.
---
I guess it depends on where you draw the line between "completely safe" and "acceptably safe." Honestly the effort to dead drop, pre anchor cans, create pre defined routes that you repeat, ect, are fucking silly for exploration. A covops and basic skills like cloak mwd out of bubbles will keep you safe 95% of the time. 
---
If someone wants to be TOTALLY sure they're safe, go ahead and do those things and have the concerns you listed. But also make sure you log in right at downtime and spam dscan until DT comes again, making sure no one is around, and then run it in that last minutes before the servers go down! Now you're really safe! 🙄
---
you serious?
---
not only a c4 corp, but a WOLF RAYET C4 CORP.
---
Prob 50% to 90%.  It varies.  Almost every PvE character I had also had a hunter trained on the same account or had some other use.  So even when I am not krabbing I tend to sub a lot of them as needed.
---
I believe CCP expects to make less money now simply due to bots and multi-boxers getting the shaft, but the ceiling is much higher going forward because the game will be healthier.  There was nothing healthy about running 5 Rorqs safely in Esoteria while I fucked around with you guys in Delve.  That is not good for the game.
---
Oh I love em, fun little doctrine to fly when you get bored of the meta.
---
If someone views WoW Classic as a complete and better Eve replacement, then fuck off and enjoy, Eve wasn't for you anyways.
---
bring 200 stukas and ill murder you with just 70 other subs of different type... what about that?
---
if you face stukas and you ball up and hope for the best you deserve to be punished and thats what inexperienced fcs do
---
We all had fun, the isk is whatever tbh
---
Would've been had we had our third xD
---
Unfortunately, my alt struggled through the entire fight
---
o/
---
They targeted C4 corps and miners.
---
C4 corps and miners.
---
We're   a group of people who will sit for hours, days, even weeks on end   performing some of the hardest, most mentally demanding tasks. Over, and   over, and over all for nothing more than a little digital token in the  ledger saying  we did. Mining
---
We'll punish our selfs doing things others would consider torture, because we think it's fun. Mining
---
We'll   spend most if not all of our free time min maxing the stats of a   fictional spaceship all to draw out a single extra point of ore per   yield. Mining
---
Many of us have made   careers out of doing just these things: slogging through the grind,  all  day, the same belts over and over, hundreds of times to the point  where  we know every little rock detail such that some have attained  such miner nirvana that they can literally mine these belts blindfolded.
---
Do   these people have any idea how many evil wormholers have been smashed,   mining systems depleted, structures grinded for safety? All to  latter  be referred to as bragging rights in TiS discord?
---
These   wormholers honestly think this is a battle they can win? They think  they can control the narrative? We're already building a new one without  them. They take our  devs and turn them into hateful wormholers  spreading chaos? Miners aren't shy about throwing their isk else where.  They think calling us retarded, autistic,  npcs is going to change us?  We've been called worse things  by prepubescent 10 year olds with a  shitty hs corp. They picked a fight  against a group that's already  grown desensitized to their strategies  and methods. Who enjoy the  battle of attrition they've threatened us  with. Who take it as a  challange when they tell us we no longer matter.  Our obsession with  mining after being told we can't mine so much is so deeply  ingrained  from years of dealing with the evil ncpl laughing at how pathetic we  used to be that proving you people wrong has  become a very real need; a  honed reflex. now where is ncpl? in wormholes with their alts since  they cant stand to the honorable alliance of coalitions.
---
Miners  are elite and competative, hard core, by nature. We love a challange.  The worst  thing you did in all of this was to challange us. You're not  special,  you're not original, you're not the first; your structures are  just another rock. we will outlast you elite pvpers
---
MINERS RISE UP
---
by  supporting WORMHOLERS, you are LITERALLY supporting the deaths of   every single GROUP minority not just in NULLSEC, but in C4 WORMHOLES,  LOWSEC AND HIGHSEC as well. every single little guy that dies is the  FAULT OF WORMHOLERS. then you  go fucking thing "ahahaha miner owned!  get a permit!! gf epic win!" shut the fuck up. this  is fucking serious.  a REAL elite PVPer would realize he has to stand up  for his fellow  miners by virtue signaling. wormholers are nazis flying elite unkillable  nano bullshit cloaky gay ships that oppress miners and kill them  without mercy.  all WORMHOLES are run by the TRIUMVIRATE OF HATE   tyrants hK, BOLTA and HAWKS  who put drifters  in concentration  "farmhole" camps, use their wormholes to spread death and terror upon  innocent miners, building a wall of DEATH using ships that were built by  MINERS, and  killing any hope for peaceful wormholers. The only hope  for wormholes rest in C4 space, that has aligned itself with the good  guys of eve ( The imperium and legacy ) but their efforts are in vain  due to the other class wormholers oppressing c4 space. and its all  because you stupid  C5 apologists fucking incels gobbled up his lies and  cucked yourselves just to laugh  at innocent miners dying. all across  the new eden star cluster miners are dying on mass, and you sit in your  basement laughing.  "b-b- the miner resisted!"  But miners and C4  honorable wormholers of peace have had enough....the miners WILL rise to  fight the wh nazis in C2 and C5 space, C4 groups everywhere tweet the  narrative of freedom from the hk, hawks and volta oppressors of hate,  corps from of all ns and c4 space stand  together to break their evil  sphere of hate and resist, it is over. brisc has the  evidence. it may  not be now, it may not be soon, it may even be  posthumous. but hK and  hawks will go down. and once your precious tiny  dicked tiny handed  sphere of hate volta loving c5 wormhole is seeded by 2000 honorable  ravens you cockholsters are done for, we will go after the  c2&lt;ns/c5,  c5s, thera, and the mentally ill who  kill miners. their attempts to  undermine our peaceful alliance will not be  left unpunished, and we  will deal with them in time. and the other evil wormholer corps  too,   too. ALL THE DEAD MINERS ARE YOUR FAULT FOR NOT DOING ANYTHING,  fuck  you.
---
Actually I think CCP is doing that to inflate “active ISK”, to stress test their new economic changes.
---
I'll put whatever music you want ada, when it's not a raw comms one.
---
Miss you, bae. Tell ncc he owes me money.
---
Far too late for that
---
Does this mean walking in stations is coming back!?
---
One day of pvp in LS and you go below -5 easily if you shoot pod.
---
Sure, but in those cases would you rather have a pilot in the heat thingie, or in a bhaalgorn that can turn off those modules altogether?
---
As far as Marauders go, if this becomes an EWAR weapon, bastion will likely be updated to add resistance to that as well. 
---
T3s would be the class that this is the least effective on as they have bonuses toward heat generation.
---
Maybe this is all just the old player in me, but... ratting with caps at all is gross. They should be the last word in warfare escalation, the jewel of a fleet, requiring actual support to make them fully effective. Solo high-level isk printing tool? Heck, solo at all? Just ew. 
---
Dreadnoughts should be siege tools, not one-man-navies (no ship should be capable of this).
---
As for wormholers, this shit wouldn't even faze us. And if it did, we're hardy. We'll survive just fine, and figure out new ways to have fun in the meta while we're at it.
---
2010 and I'm at 99 mil. Soon.
---
Well thanks for the explanation. Reddit is a weird place with weird people!
---
I wanna see EVE return to its dark, hard-to-play roots, dropping down to 2009-2010 PCU, all these fad gamers quitting as the theme park dies, and then slowly climb from there, being populated by hardened SOBs.
---
Key differences:
---
Wormholers/small pvp groups want Eve to be less safe, for everyone.
---
Nullbears respond with dumb shit like "ha get rid of mass limits ya! That will show them! Who's game is ruined now!" When in reality it ends up in net PvP loss, but they feel good because now someone else is angry too.
---
I just can't wait for the cyno change and all the dead Rorqs and Supers piloted by carebears who can't press a single button to save themselves anymore.
---
Ahh it was that patch.
---
I can't answer because I've only used my rorq once to mine and it was to push an escalation (never came). I know others mine a lot so I guess they're okay with it. We are under no illusion that we don't have an umbrella and anytime we field them they could die.
---
What I miss about the passive mining was the ability to shoot the tower and generate a (hopefully) favorable timer. It just doesn't seem to be the same with these.
---
Can you put some of that salt on my omelette please
---
Probably not, they know if you used the token to actually log into the client. But good luck, perhaps they are generous :)
---
Or you could, you know, actually try to think about what's being said before getting so defensive. The game's an ecosystem, and we've seen in real life that when predators are driven out, prey species overgrow their niche and put everything into disarray. It's the same here and has been absolutely stagnating the game.
---
I’m sure ccp can figure out a way to make a tether toggle button that will eat fuel
---
Ah, yea I guess thats true, wormholers will figure stuff out. Also, why do you hate “solo high-level isk printing tools”?
---
Imagine having to “garden” a system. It’d be great. Especially the outrage from players.
---
Only if you shoot pods without limited engagement, nor suspect, aka if you whore on the pod of someone that didn't shoot you.
---
Have you tried not blobbing?
---
If you solo PvP and your target shoots back, that's a total non issue. If you're hanging noobs, the security penalty being a source of discomfort is doing its job.
---
Citation needed on real player count dropping
---
Seeing as trigs already have history with mass manipulation (hi zero-points), it would be logical to give them ability to remotely increase the ships mass leading to "soft tackle" of sorts.
---
Also, it would be fun to see 6k ceptor not being able to turn and skimm away beyond the grid 😁
---
\&gt; 'Farmville Online' players which to them insults their playstyle.  
---
Those people need to grow the fuck up.  
---
Waaaah he called me a Farmville Online player waah  
---
are you kidding me
---
Now just don’t reinstall and boom you won the game
---
SELL NOW
---
&gt; Pick up the loot in a interceptor
---
And if you have an alt on a separate acct, you can use him to scout gates as well.
---
I'm playing a Frost Mage on Herod.
---
In a sense, aren't they though?
---
GOONS ARE THE MOST OPPRESSED MINORITY
---
BEES RISE UP
---
Even bots already adapted, but not you
---
&gt;PvP area
---
This mindset is exactly why LowSec is dead and shit.
---
ALL areas of EVE are PvP areas.
---
Have fun camping your LowSec gate with your instalock Gnosis and blap Proteus.
---
2011 called, they want their shitty gameplay back.
---
Lowsec is not lawless. It is supposed to offer a layer of basic protection, gate guns, no bubbles, etc.  I think if you wanna be a pirate preying on non-consensual papers in lowsec then it makes sense you get a reputation as such. You can always go to null or wormholes if it's a problem, but ratting back up from -10 to -2 doesn't take so long just a few circles around wildlands in a bomber.
---
If you don't ball up it means you aren't warping around or booshing which means you aren't actually able to pursue the booshers. Sure, you can just sit their spread out in a 60-80km diameter ball and wait until they leave, but then you have no ability to actually do anything but react.
---
Not to mention that spreading out makes you vulnerable to snatch tactics, which you can't reliably respond to if you are spread out enough to mitigate bomb damage.
---
Boosh Eagles or something similar is the only way to actually aggressively counter boosh fleets, otherwise you are just standing around waiting for them to fuck up.
---
This sub is a lot saltier and butthurt than I remember it being.
---
EVE-O forums are making a slow comeback.
---
When 50% of your player base is just krabbing while Netflix and PLEXing a bunch of accounts.... Yeah dump them. 
---
What you used to do doesn't mean much, what you do now is stagnant.
---
Also, there's a massive difference between someone who lives and plays in null than a nullbloccer. 
---
But yeah 100%, gtfo go play Farmville :)
---
Or don't, idc either way - but CCP is ruining *your* game, so you might as well lol. 
---
I'd rather eve just shuts down servers than slowly continues to stagnate further down the road it's on.
---
The standing loss for militia members is worse, more so these days since every trade hub except jita is dead. The answer has always been get more alts to move stuff. You have to commit if you want that dank lowsec life. Honestly its not that bad. There is much bigger problems in lowsec. You got all these null toys like supers and citadels floating around, all that shit needs to GTFO.
---
&gt;I’m a badass wormhole boomer
---
Weird flex but olé
---
Oh, I don't know, CCP's own words maybe?
---
It doesn't, it has to do with your interpretation of the contract clauses. While you are correct that they are meant as an incentivizing model, they can also cause a company to choke out profit from places they normally wouldnt, in ways they normally wouldnt, in the event that some profit streams are not realized, but were targeted in valuation discussions. This is why it's a positive approach from PA, as they can hedge their bets, but could be pretty detrimental to CCP, as a company known for under-delivering.   
---
These changes are positive in the short term, but potentially negative in the long term, and Hilmar is in a strangely conflicted position here, as he currently represents himself ([at ~6% ownership of the company](https://www.frettabladid.is/markadurinn/hilmar-faer-rja-milljara-fyrir-soeluna-a-ccp/)), his CCP private investors, and [his new bosses at PA](https://variety.com/2018/gaming/news/ccp-games-pearl-abyss-sale-eve-online-1202936322/). There is a fiduciary responsibility to all three parties there, and I'm not sure these changes long-term reflect the best interest of all three parties, so that's an interesting rope to have to walk.   
---
I also don't disagree that if PA were to sign a contract based solely around MAU/DAU they would deserve to get manipulated on it, but I don't think that's what is going on here either. Guess we'll see.
---
5 rorquals = 5 decent targets for a small group, now the pond is a little dryer without those out there
---
That's a totally reasonable comment. You're grasping at straws trying to take offense at the absolutely spot-on farming simulator comparison.
---
Check logs? It's possible that those and your cache files have been growing in the background and you never even noticed
---
[FUCK THIS GUY IN PARTICULAR!](https://www.change.org/p/pearl-abyss-fire-hilmar-veigar-p%C3%A9tursson-aka-ccp-hilmar-without-any-golden-parachutes)
---
Plex prices dropping means that demand is dropping. In other words people buy less plex, i.e. unsubbing their accounts. You fucking idiot.
---
You're interpreting my message and/or flair completely wrong, my friend.
---
I've never argued against balance changes. I've honestly had a lot of fun during the Blackout, even as a nullsec line member.
---
But to me, that word should mean what it's meant to mean, balance. Not 'Oh, those nullseccers have had it their way for x time. Now it should be our time'. To me, that's not balanced. 
---
And as I said, it's perfectly fine to disagree on what or how, as long as we keep listening to each other. Not start calling people names and using that to make their opinion invalid.
---
You can get around this with containers, but it's annoying as fuck.
---
Maybe so but in this case the OP being discussed is a noob astero pilot...
---
&gt;Have you tried not blobbing?
---
Flair does NOT check out
---
I'm going to send some t1 industrials through SV5 so you can keep yourself busy instead of just whining with the same old sky is falling crap.
---
ALMOST there pal, hang in there! xD
---
Don't forget all the signs that nullsec botting has reduced significantly. You can see this by the massive reduction, if not total elimination of npcs killed in previously bot heavy systems.
---
I haven't a clue.
---
Who someone is doesn't make the slightest not of difference in whether or not there idea is good or not though. 
---
I think people feel that if mechanics change then people will change, they won't. 
---
Stop trying to compromise with the players who are the problem (afk and botters). Eve doesn't benefit from then, at all.
---
It comes out today (26th at 3PM PDT).  Just from GSF alone I know of over 200 folks that will be playing the hell out of WoW Classic.
---
I formulated badly, it's expected loss actually
---
It would un-ironically be nice to force the tornado gank to actually do something instead of AFK in front of a station for hours.
---
Wow, you whs are so cool!
---
Your risk of being killed does go up if you have more loot. Risk = Probability x Consequence . More loot = higher consequence.
---
Sometimes people rip shit out to reduce the KM size.
---
They dont even look to see what sticks, they throw shit at the wall and reach for more shit 6 mo later...
---
Show me on the doll where the big goon hurt you
---
Nos so your tackle doesn’t get neuted off.
---
Anchovies are basically Umami and salt flavor packets. Unless you use a ton, you won't taste fish.
---
I have no idea how the chat code looks -- but a delay is not a complex feature. They have already most of the work in anyway. For example how the chat behaves right now. You don't show up until you speak. So now there would be a timed trigger that makes you show up after a given time.. shouldn't be much different.
---
Mobile depot in as deep a safe as convenient.
---
If you thought you didn't have many targets now, the thought hasn't crossed your mind of what happens with the upcoming fall/winter games releases.
---
Wow classic is just the first true warning shot for eve to get its shit together, unless the goal is for the game to be something you login to only after a ping for fleet support and nothing else.
---
Again. CCP has no part in AetherWars. Different company with different coders, devs and management. You really need to actually read up on things you're gonna take up pitchforks about because all you are doing is making youtself look like an idiot.
---
I don't think mastering what you do is silly, I do pick good periods of the day to do exploration for loot, and I do pick good periods to go hunting, because this way you have more lot and content. 
---
Last minutes before dt and after dt are not good for scanning btw
---
Fuck me you guys dont know you're born.  We used to have to belt rat that shit up now you have it super easy and go buy clone soldier tags. Instant fuckery  sorted.
---
Tbh I wish CCP would unfuck  that and remove them.  You want free kills go live in null esp npc null if you want fights or join FW and get shitloads of targets for free
---
Sick
---
With ALL the krabs gone we can finally take their place and farm endlessly.
---
Wooooosh
---
Idk about completely removing it, but when on grid with a Plex gate or within a Plex itself - losing sec status for PvP is absurd. No clue how it ever was introduced to the game in the first place. 
---
The analytics farthest if go with it would be to extend no loss of sec status to anywhere within a FW system. And give players an alert when they are entering one.
---
Shatered? ;)
---
As someone who hunts explorers quite often the hardest to catch and kill are exploration fit interceptors. You can put everything you need to probe and do the sites on a stiletto with warp core stabs. Your exploration will be slower without specific bonuses but you won't die unless you make a mistake or someone really wants you dead. An average exploration hunter will have difficulty catching you.
---
It goes up if I'm hunting you since I'll wait for you to go fill up with loot before I decide to kill you. I gotta eat too.
---
Bot aspirant == content
---
That sounds like a bug to me. I don't think sleeper caches are supposed to just despawn while you're in them.
---
Just a quick note on npc keeps in each region: This only helps those entrenched in the area. If you wanted to make use of the system in a way that doesn't just allow people to treat it as an invulnerable keepstar, you need to tie docking rights with npc standings. 
---
However, you also need to ensure that people can't just stay permadocked until they don't want to. It's a tricky thing to do, especially with how eve players will exploit anything and everything they can.
---
Sleeper caches are not the same as ghost sites. See:  [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Superior\_Sleeper\_Cache](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Superior_Sleeper_Cache)
---
I truly almost bit the onion here
---
Is douchie regardless of the space. You lose isk and waste time. Learn to scan, scrub.
---
As I have said before, the Trig ewar should probably be a module that can project abyssal effects. 
---
Fix ECM first.
---
Anchovies unironically are a great way to add umami to red meat. They're not called "Italian MSG" for no reason; they're full of glutamates.
---
Yes, that sounds accurate! o/
---
100%. There was a lot of stupid things CCP has done, but releasing Dust on the PS3 was the stupidest. It still leaves me dumbfounded.
---
Risk is "a situation involving exposure to danger," not whatever highschool big brain formula you came up with to apply to it. Having more loot does not mean you are more likely to get killed, anyone willing to kill you is generally doing so because the opportunity presents itself. More jumps increase risk because you're raising the potential of running into someone, or a gatecamp. They're aren't more likely to kill you because of how many sites you ran, it's because there's opportunity.
---
Did Orion Sa-Solo take all?
---
Had you tried to hunt VNIs before? It's just bads that got caught. Everyone had at the very least Near2 or other intel tools to ping at them whenever intel channels reported anything.
---
Most just insta warped to a safe place the instant a non blue was in local. Almost like, say, a bot.
---
So afk miners and krabbers aren't logging in anymore? Excellent. 
---
I hope they don't come back, unless ofc they actually want to get behind their keyboard. 
---
It's unlikely that these numbers represent significant amount of people who were doing anything interesting. 
---
Honestly if eve dies without them, better that than let it slowly continue to devolve.
---
It's low security not no security dumbass.
---
Na, logistics forgot to order them imported. So it was just local built. Which reached demand with black ops
---
A super nice side effect of blackout it seems everyone can support.
---
Primarily because it makes inflation way too easy, and thus more rampant. Secondarily because it encourages using what *should* be simply the end goal of grinding (a powerful tool for pvp) as a tool to avoid engaging with other players to accomplish big things. On that note, I know multiboxing is a thing, too... but that's another "feature" I think was a mistake to support. That one will never go away at this point, though.
---
Haven’t played eve in a decade. Interested in getting back into it. Any suggestions on guides, how-to’s or start up suggestions? Looking to do the mining with some pew pew after I’ve established some good income streams. 
---
Thanks!
---
\*You can also snapchat me!\* &lt;3
---
Found the Farmviller.
---
It's already incredibly "smooth." Using dscan and learning how to navigate gatecamps take care of 95% of the risk you can mitigate. You're going to efforts as if you're carrying Molok BPCs around Delve, not data/relic can hacking around null. If you're even remotely decent it's a very safe activity to do
---
That would be an awesome nerf to super/cap ratting pockets. Do it for a couple week and the sec status is -0.01 and the anom quality takes a nose dive. Meanwhile random forgotten null system slowly descends to -1.00
---
You may find sth intresting there btw dont forget to bookmark your wh , gl with finding it :D
---
So you want to become what you hate.
---
Eve has been out for 16 years and has experienced fall winter releases of every game in that period, including vanilla WoW.
---
There’s plenty of targets, do something other than waiting for pings and watching your wallet tick and you’ll see that as well.
---
Leave your nullblock and you’ll find plenty more and meaningful content than just pushing F1 in your ferox or muninn.
---
Well, "to survive" is probably a stretch but I do earn a lot of quick cash blowing up these loot pinatas and since the blackout a lot of ratters are too afraid to go out, especially in anything expensive. Explorers aren't scared and they fill themselves up with expensive loot. The fights aren't interesting but the hunt can be, some of them are pretty stubborn about being killed. It's a fun casual way to play the game.
---
Oh crap, did something happen to Stainguy?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9tcA_AM4BE
---
That would sure make Red Giants more interesting...
---
Space Foreman don't fuck around.
---
Thera?
---
A fax is not a magic blanket. It reps within a 60km bubble. All the subcaps are leashed to it. So use mobility and range.
---
Tbh it's not a huge drop I expected more.  Numbers can be better looked at by the number of NPCs or minerals mined before and during blackout.
---
Do we have those?
---
Elite dangerous is great for system sight seeing
---
Star citizen will have probably the best planetary sights (in 100 years, maybe) with decent balance all around,
---
Eve is the jack of all trades, with a semi-major specialization in fleet/ship sights
---
*precisely* Not a *single* *sane* person will. But there's plenty of people who aren't sane enough for that to apply. Hell I would throw 50 billion at it and I could get 20 corpies with me quite easy. 
---
Chribba asking people to send isk to one of his alts to upgrade stations would get atleast one probably 3-4 in rather short amount of time.
---
It should be a community effort, not something a single person could do
---
why waste time making skins for less popular ships? That's not gonna bring in money or incentivize people.
---
Fish anf potatoes
---
Drifter wormholes are like that.
---
your taxes at work
---
55*
---
I mean good, well-balanced ecm would be absolutely amazing. I've been waiting on that since 2005 though...
---
How about progressive? Every polarized weapon cycle makes the dread ever so slightly more polarized and resets a 15 second timer to start slow decay back to unpolarized. 200-300 cycles and the dread is fully polarized. Risk vs. Reward kicks in.
---
we're doing pretty well too, bill
---
https://zkillboard.com/alliance/927292903/
---
Having done this a few times before, I can bet the rose-colored glasses are *real* right now. It's not gonna be as great as it was the first time.
---
There's definitely a potential for loss to something outside of your control (someone sitting in a site, waiting) but it's small enough that it's almost just an anomaly. This can be compensated for by warping off as they decloak, which is reasonably easy with attention paid and lock delays from decloaking. In the case of a bomber than insta scrams you, there's always the Astero which can take care of them handily and still escape from larger ambushers
---
Auto route to all factories using specified material please...
---
Auto route all specified materials to specified destination please...
---
You're a good man, Smokes.
---
You can always drop loot in any citadel and aaset safety it
---
This is great if you just want to continue exploring
---
Downside is the 15% tax and the 20 day wait
---
Finally, take a mobile depot and a warp stab refit and a pvp refit
---
This reads like a bad IELTS Task 1 example
---
yes, some of the large coallitions arent sending their ore to the jita market, and that is the only reason ore / minerals dont cost 0.01 isk
---
You're probably in a named Wormhole or a drifter hole.
---
Looks like Thera or a Shattered wormhole.
---
they would take your money and just make more skins with it
---
I've been using a rocket and blaster fit manticore with dual scrams and enough tank to brawl down most asteros. It's specialized and unless the explorer has help once I've caught them the are almost definitely dead.
---
At that point it comes down to aligning and praying to the based EC-300 Gods that the Astero should be carrying haha.
---
Another zinger keep em coming AHAHA
---
Maybe it's all the porn...
---
but they're in iceland so you're wrong
---
Wow didn't know doing well enough to whelp some T1 frigs in is that big of a flex these days :P
---
dunked
---
Prices don't go down when demand goes up.
---
Also, low Plex prices could hurt CCP.
---
There's basically two types of buyers, the whales and everyone else.  The whales are gonna buy a ton of Plex and don't particularly care what the RL cost is, they just want their ISK.
---
"Everyone else" buys Plex as a top-off, and less ISK per dollar/euro/etc is going to reduce their purchases.  AKA, they're price-sensitive, and the whales aren't.
---
We don't know which buyers are making CCP more money.  It could be 10,000 people buying one Plex vs one person buying 500, or it could be 1000 vs 5000.
---
If CCP's making all their money off the whales, they are helped by a low ISK price.  If CCP's making all their money of "everyone else", then it's hurt by a low ISK price.
---
I really wonder how many trillions of isk are sitting in some of those null structures on inactive characters
---
Why not bring local back as a upwell/pos that can be disrupted with some moderate squad/gang effort? Hell make it something that needs to be in the lowsec areas only as an antenna for null.  If it requires plunder-able fuel/components to run it will... "enhance" piracy and force large entities to have a logistics and infrastructure cost for their precious intel channels.
---
Chaos Era
---
Nope. -10 highsec gankers know exactly how to operate with a -10 status and what they can and can't do.
---
Making WHs more dangerous (i.e. more content!) sounds fine. But eliminating rolling and letting supers in would just turn them into more boring K-Space, bleugh. There might be something to the proposed ideas of exit holes being hidden somehow, though... letting hostiles slip through without advance warning, reducing the possibility for krabby hole control.
---
Yes, totally what's gonna happen. Brilliant deductive capabilities.
---
(not really)
---
Best response in the entire thread.
---
That wormhole gets around, it's riddled
---
From my perspective I have indeed more fun/h
---
One thing I would like to point out that I feel you didn't touch on in your data here. You make no mention of botting, or how a reduction in not clients would effect the peak numbers you are referencing. 
---
I think this is important because botting has become a huge problem for Eve, and the black out has at least temporarily brought an end to quite a lot of it. 
---
I think that purely looking at the numbers doesn't tell the whole story because botting clients are included with the server statistics you are talking about and while I certainly don't see the vast numbers of bots we were seeing before blackout, I feel like I have seen more real players playing the game. I've actually felt an uptick in fights, and content that previously was impossible to get before.
---
Rather it die than continue to stagnate.
---
Good. I'll finally be free of this terrible game.
---
Honestly though, this is probably the best thing that could happen for the game. CCP is finally trying things that they were traditionally too conservative to dare to try.
---
Sure, not every change will be a net positive, but the only way we can definitively know that is to try it. It's better than just more of the same tiny little tweaks every year and a half or whatever.
---
That's a really specific play style.
---
Armour rattles is a interesting topic.
---
We were actually not the group who developed that doctrine interestingly enough. It had been used by a few other groups before us with success in eviction  scenarios.
---
So it does have some logic. The problem is that when we made that our doctrine we could perhaps field 30 people in said scenario. 
---
So the logic was that they would support with web and scrams aswell as provide good dps. We simply did not have the people when we made the doctrine to go for either tackle or dps. we had to have both.
---
By the time the eviction happened this doctrine was hopelessly outdated and we could and should have changed it way before. But it was a viable choice at the moment we made it.
---
Also one thing i want to point out last is that before that battle nobody expected to see 160 machariels in a wormhole.
---
Come to paleo undock, you'll get plenty of pvp
---
What? I’m saying that if you do a day of lowsec pvp in anything including shitter frigate fights you just taxxed yourself 200m worth of tags for a day of pvp
---
Mmhmm. See you in space in 2020.
---
Look at your last sentence. Your way of thinking is that if the game isn't what you like, it should die. Common view between all the nullsec haters.
---
Now, before you blame me for being the same, I am just saying that if I don't like the game, I will leave it and many others will too. It's very different from hoping the game to die.
---
What does MMO have to do with "communities"?
---
Take any huge-ass battle in EVE and 99.9% of players don't even know each other.
---
I blame the parents
---
We all knew Hilmar was a slimeball when he originally bragged about the player count after that first massive skillpoint event.
---
He is a definition as well as this company of the "This is fine" meme
---
Its becuse he only listen to himself. So many players told him why the change he support are bad and even now he still want to keep this change that are hurting all the player base.
---
He only things on his play style and only want to boost his play style droping stupid arguments of "why the change he wants are good" when all shows how its all wrong.
---
Nullsec is now Wh space without the benefits, seems right you are turned into nullsec now.
---

---
If you don´t finish the sites, sooner or later, you are fucking yourself.
---
Please say that the jita bunny won't go away..
---
Where does it say that CCP is thinking of doing this. I checked all the regular sources and found no mention of this.
---
&gt;However, the ceiling for Eve is much higher as a hardcore space MMO than a theme park MMO.
---
First, Eve is not at all a theme-park MMO.  For one example, where's the quest lines that dominate all of your gameplay?  That's the #1 criteria for a theme-park MMO.
---
Second, \[Citation Required\].  Lots of MMOs came out that tried to be more "Hardcore" as their differentiator back when everyone was trying to beat WoW.  All of them did very, very poorly.
---
That doesn't mean that CCP should blindly follow WoW, that would be "Everquest 2"-level stupid.  But it would indicate the market for a "hardcore" MMO is nowhere near as large as you seem to think.
---
Third, CCP's changes are not making the game harder.  They're making the game easier for hunters, because so many hunters couldn't grasp concepts like "choose a target you can actually kill" and "you need to leave when you're about get overwhelmed".
---
Fourth, you've completely forgotten that the "safety" you hate was created *by the players.*  They worked their asses off.  IOW, they were way more "hardcore" than you.  These changes do not change that dynamic.  And once they've adapted, you'll be back demanding more nerfs.
---
I don't disagree.  I am just talking realities.  How are we going to get better decisions requiring more resources to implement when we didn't get them when more resources were available?
---
Assuming they aren't going to iterate well, I would prefer them to iterate more and that we get lucky enough that they stop if things are better.  The last 3-4 years were not good.  And they were not good in a particular direction.  CCP is now moving in a different direction.  The changes may still not be good, but at least they are turning it away from a direction that will lead to certain doom.
---
You need to change your flair.  All those logged off caps were rescued by Black Legion in the following week.

“Here’s 20 data points, let’s draw some really strong conclusions.”
---
Said no statistician ever.
---
&gt;Those people need to grow the fuck up.
---
Perhaps but don't you think you will get people to understand your point of view better if they don't already have a negative mindset due to something they might feel like a slight to their playstyle?
---
Your numbers show a net change of -4k and in the July 2019 security report CCP states they have banned 20k accounts.  In July alone they banned 2k accounts.
---
I think you're dramatically overestimating your correlations.
---
I also think you're an idiot but that's beside the point.
---
Anchovies?   Bob save us....
---
Mmm, no, that's isn't what I said. I said I would prefer it to die off than "*continue to stagnate further down the road it's on*".
---
That's not saying I want it to die off in it's current state now is it? 
---
Words mean things.
---
Fwiw, I have fun every time I log into Eve. I always have, if I didn't i sure as hell wouldn't log on. What kind of jackass plays a video game they don't like haha? 
---
What we've seen lately is CCP make a decision to a timely Nerf it's most unbalanced game mechanics, which unsurprisingly large portions of their player base lean heavily on. 
---
This should be a welcome change, but ofc the vocal minority who refuse to change and are too upset to just stop playing come here to whine about it.
---
I disagree, I think it's great CCP is attempting to rebalancing it's incredibly unbalanced game. 
---
Of course there is a chance they will fail, but if you feel that doing nothing and stagnating is better than trying because you might fail... Well, life isn't going to treat you well buddy. 
---
So I say, I would rather they try and fail than do nothing and let the game slowly devolve down the path it's currently on. 
---
You disagree, that's fine. Don't expect to won me over.
---
I'm on a Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL, both are unable to install - it's not because of my region
---
It's been 3-4 years since I won EvE but I still can't give up this subreddit.
---
Youre really just grasping at straws at this point dude
---
Man, so weird to see so many people going back to what is, essentially, a solved game. I guess I'm the rare person who will keep WoW as a fond memory and not go back to taint it.
---
Drifter?
---
I'd be in lowsec much much more if I wasn't punished for pvp.
---
They purge it occasionally
---
Probably and Icelandic thing.
---
Hunters say they love the Blackout, but now few ratters will undock their expensive capitals, so then hunters get little to no capital kills. 
---
Nobody spends hours on a roam fleet saying "I can't wait to tell my friends/corpmates about those 3 VNI/Mrym kills we got tonight!" They want big juicy capital kills.
---
So it ends up being a lose-lose for everyone. 
---
Then with the 50%+ drop in ratting income and cyno changes, that is likely to result in fewer big wars which is what is used in CCP marketing to draw in new players.
---
Ohgod I stumbled on one the other day... 60+ wormholes or some shit, I noped out after scanning like 4, fuck that noise.
---
*night prior is basically what ended being decided*
---
With the caveate that we established no one else was coming in and no hole control was needed. Our warp in person for people ingressing was being tackled and in hull prior to us undocking. Him saying we were going to be ganked and to get off grid when he wasnt the FC didnt make a difference in the flow of things. When he brought it up, pouty, several minutes later like "Since Im not an FC" it was really unneeded. As far as defensiveness goes you can see the amount of "why didnt you step up F1 monkey" comments and downvotes. I don't think Im being overly defensive. I played my part, invested my ISK and time and kept quiet as my corp decided to. Guess I made a pretty polarizing comment as Ive seen the votes swing back and forth.
---
As I said in many other comments here, it's ok to disagree. I, according to your assessment, might fall more in the 'carebear' category and don't feel I'm playing 'Farmville Online'. 
---
I don't feel like the comparison of someone's playstyle to 'Farmville Online' is helping. Especially if it's being used as an argument to ignore their opinion. I'm not offended by the comment but it does signal something about the mindset of the writer. So I can see why this might start a spiral of less and less civil responses. Which brings none of us any further.
---
incoming iTs JuSt BoTs comments
---
I can't see them in game, are you looking on sisi?
---
I'd be in lowsec much more if the faction police wouldn't shoot me in highsec. I'm perfectly okay with other players being able to shoot me in highsec with a low security status, but the faction police make any potential fight impossible.
---
I mean, that's literally just deleting wormholes. If that's your idea of a positive change at the moment, long live the blue donut I guess. Sounds to me like you're a tad vengeful (salty?).
---
Need some way to anonymize candidacy.

Dude, you are wrong. It's good you decided to go and wiki risk, but it's not enough

Can I have your stuff?
---
good guy ccp giving more reasons for ppl to play wow classic instead of this shit game
---
You know what I tell my friends about on discord? What an awesome fight I had against another alliance defending their ratters from us.
---
I appreciate everything you represent.
---
With the API there's a max 90 day retention on transactions, I'd assume something similar in-game happened to you
---
Should have kept the ability for jfs to jump to covert cynos.
---
Man I fucking wish, but I don't think that's in the cards.
---
Am I? 
---
Hm, wanting this game to be better and trying to get people talking about how to do that is grasping at straws?
---
Actually, you might be right.
---
Fuck you ccp and your alternate decisions 
---
Best part of these cyno changes is jfs get to jump to coverts wtf. CSM do your job.
---
So community vigils for if safety. Seems legit.
---
Part of me knew they would do this but I'm disappointed they didn't stick with their guns. 
---
Now they've shown they'll back down.
---
A part of me likes this change. The other part of me dislikes that they can't jump to covert cynos
---
torching and burning Jita 4-4 would be an interesting way to shake the box.
---
I honestly miss station games, I hate that people can sit undocked but untouchable
---
Remind me on 1 Jan 2020 to check this post.
---
Lmao
---
I expect that with the cyno changes you will see less defense fleets able to get there in time, unless the hunters specifically hold the target waiting for a response.

This.  All the times I listen to him, he has no point and no backup for it.

The vast majority of his points are spin-off points of the Grr-Goons variety.  
---
Umbrella is almost as dumb as Krab.
---
Nobody cares. Its here, its happening,  having a goon post a reddit thread a day bitching about isnt changing that.
---
Their entire point was a workaround so they didn't have to make a new type. Now there is a new type, this covert cynos for JF don't make sense.
---
So it’s going to force alliances to not spread across multiple regions? That sounds great to me. Gates still work too you know. And jump gates.
---
maybe they're making multiple undock points like an upwell structure?  would definitely cut down on clusterfucks on the undock.
---
Memory leaks are typically in RAM. This is a broken install.
---
CSM Olmeca Gold has on-record said to me, that "I should not have to use traps, or login/logoff games to catch and kill a super carrier".
---
Honestly at this point skins are pretty much all that keeps some in:p
---
I to have taken an economics class... and demand isn’t going up because those pve players that dock up when things show up on intel are leaving the game. They don’t buy subs for the 12 accounts they run. They buy plex in jita to sub those accounts. The pvpers are usually the ones that are directly buying plex packages from CCP. This is why the prices are going down. I wasn’t saying the demand curve was going up. I was saying the demand curve was going down. Congrats spod brain.
---
AHAHAHAH. Careful what you wish for, sometimes you get it.
---
You have an actual statement, from CCP, that blackout actually RAISED the player count ?
---
Been sniffing spod lately retard?
---
&gt;i think the caladri should get ~~their 2nd~~ **a working and useful form of** ewar before trigs get anything
---
Fixed that for ya.
---
He has abused every income source in the game that is considered 'cheesable' and then complains that goons are breaking the game, while farming hundreds of billions from under their 'game breaking protection'. 
---
Anyone taking his opinion on anything relating to risk and balance is a moron.
---
Reread what i said. You’ve been sniffing that spod too much. This is exactly what I was saying.
---
What so people can look at a fucking 10k queue?
---
Which for example.. turns it into MORE accounts ? A fuckton of myrm is still a fuckton.
---
People saying "ThEy ShOuLd StIlL Be AbLe tO uSe CoVeRt CyNoS!!!" Stop being retarded. They were only able to as a means to not completely fuck all logistics movement for JFs. None of it made any form of in-game sense and was an exception to the rule so it didn't require an addition type of cyno to be made. They have since changed their stance and decided to make a new cyno, thus rendering the wonky meme covert cyno-capable JF trait useless. Stop bitching that this game isn't 100% risk free.
---
Is that why old people were found to be sharing the greatest amount of fake news on social media than younger generations?
---
Wah! Grr! Arr!
---
Hes actually not. He even talks about changes in lowsec. The point of the OP is that its a sandbox game and you have to let players to what they do. I dont fully agree, but this isnt the same as being against balance. Thats always needed with anything but breaking stuff on a large scale isnt balance.
---
I see alot of people missing this quite often. The thought of balance being equal to just slaughter an entire playstyle. Its really not, thats just a recipe for failure.
---
This whole thing is silly and half baked.  Throw it back to the drawing board and cook up a real solution instead of this slapdash nonsense.
---
Hahahaha
---
Yeah, because the average guy that had limited playtime/funds/whatever being pushed off the edge is "nothing of value".
---
I would like CCP to fucking rollback everything and piss on your dream so to see the tears of people like you that just don't care about anyone else.
---
They could re-revert it back after for all I care.
---
The next will be Rorquals only being able to jump to new cynos on mining barges or mining frigates.
---
This is the CSM rep who spent 2 years telling everyone they were spodbrains and krabs and had no skill, no knowledge, no guts, and no whatever else you want.
---
People who use 'spodbrain' are just little cunts without balls, playing school yard name calling games.
---
Olmeca has been shitting over the eve playerbase for years, now lets see his CSM game face.
---
Hotel ?
---
It does make sense. You want to covertly move freight.
---
if you look at the historical player counts for this same period of time this summer is at an all time low compared to previous summers
---
Sooooooo uhhhhh can we get a refund on all the skill injectors a bunch of us JF pilots just used to skill cyno alts up to Cyno 5 that is now pretty much useless.....
---
Motel
---
100 man bomber fleets take out targets in less than 60 seconds, the only thing going to be fought over is rorqs because they have panic and its guarenteed living for 5 minutes. Everything else be dead before anything could get on grid. Maybe some smaller gang fights will occur, but the meta is and has been fairly large blops fleets, at least from any of the major powers.
---
Same here. I signed up, but was not at home when the test happened.
---
We should shoot it until the remodel stops.  #NOCHANGES
---
Holiday Inn
---
I wouldn't mind that. Prospect cyno for Rorq ccpls
---
&gt; First, Eve is not at all a theme-park MMO.
---
nullblocs are
---
&gt; was created by the players
---
so? there should be mechanics in place that balance personal effort vs coordinated effort. at one point synergy effects should run dry.   
---
&gt; They worked their asses off
---
a select few did. the average member of a large group tho: not at all.
---
I always thought it would be interesting to see an ewar module that impedes assistance. A certain percentage based on the module and skills. Things like remote reps, capacitor transfers, remote sebo, remote tracking computer, would all get impeded when you're under the effect of that module.
---
GAY
---
Nothing of value was lost
---
Why would you do that before your first cyno after the patch? Don't do dumb things.
---
You are literally crying over olmeca calling people who like to FARM, farmville players. Grow a pair dude, youre just doing it to distract from the actual discussion. It literally makes NO difference.
---
&gt;  But you're only going to have one or two sessions where you get to talk about the issues you guys as a group care about. The rest of the time it will be CCP talking to you.
---
The most polarizing issues are pretty much blackout and cyno changes, so the debates will not be chipping away from the other time.
---
&gt; You want to push your personal agenda
---
The agenda I am pushing isn't personal.
---
&gt; that hasn't been suggested before or that they've not already discussed internally. It's fun to play politician that way, but don't drink your own kool-aid.
---
The challenge with the stuff I defend isn't coming up with novel ideas and getting CCP to listen to them. It is, like your wardec case, making sure that some problems that the people I represent perceive as problems are actually perceived as problems by CCP. I personally have an educated guess that the campaign and the video had a great impact on that but I don't expect anyone including the people who voted for me to give me credit on something I cannot prove.
---
I want a kamakazie style high slot module that will kill a Titan if I bump it. We all don't get what we want, because it would be broken and stupid.
---
CCP: its a sandbox game 
---
nobody: ...
---
CCP: here have less sandbox
---
I know that's not exactly whats happening but it sure feels like it.
---
they literally said they were announcing it early so players would have time to get MCUs and skill up into the skills before they went live.
---
It is possible to get a CSM removed for insulting the community?
---
&gt; This will solve the most important issue raised which was that cyno vigils would be impossible with the steep skill and ISK requirements associated with Recons and Black Ops.
---
That wasn't the most important issue lol.
---
Just let noob ships fit the industrial cyno. You didn't add the noobship button to citadels for the newbies...
---
Wait, so covert cynos are gone for JFs? Oh wow, thats great. You nerfed the nerf. Moving industrials is a bitch, first off to setup a chain is going to be harder because well...
---
And seeding more is a bitch because of their volume. 
---
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand people had already started training into the ships.
---
Applause all around CCP.
---
Oof...
---
I know I didn’t get the login bonus for today.
---
Glad I didn't trash all my clownshoe cynos.
---
If you are talking about Stuka fleets those are different from blops fleets. You have no idea what is actually going on in the game you say you play so you? There is also more to this game than people just yanking miners and big blocs killing rorqs.
---
Covert Jump Freighters ship expansion in a later date, eh?
---
yes
---
Whats wrong with that? Like he said, all playstyles are alright, but they shouldnt absolutely outbalance the others.
---
It is often the way of the weak or insecure to just lash out in perceived retaliation.  Shame, he was doing so well before this latest 'push' before the summit.
---
He's typing and breath pauses are unnecessary. Chill out Tay Zonday.
---
injectors are instant though, no need to inject early
---
Cool, already started training more covert cynos, but I'll still need them.
---
&gt;Please do not use the flagging system to show you disagreement with these changes. Post a reply instead.

 Sincerely,

hahaha
---
You've got a get out of jail free card for spying, go to town!
---
Why means Seven of Nine is cannon in EVE!!!
---
I wouldn't mind it being possible to put a JF to either type of cyno.
---
there is no log in bonus for today, it was friday saturday sunday.
---
I actually quite enjoy NMS procedural soundtrack
---
&gt;There is also more to this game than people just yanking miners and big blocs killing rorqs.
---
From what I've seen there's big blocs killing rorqs, and the nano gangs complaining they can't kill capitals with their 3-4 frigs, and thats about it....
---
As I said in another comment, I'm not offended but you thinking I am makes me happier.
---
Just so we're on the same page, what was the actual discussion you feel I'm distracting from?
---
I'm more than willing to discuss many things, as long as we can do it in an adult way since that will probably result in more than calling each other booger. People tend to want to think along with you a lot better if you don't put them in a negative mindset by calling them names.
---
I'm curious who was murdering all of these previous vigil cynos in high sec while they were stuck in space for 10 minutes....
---
The part where you said the home hole closed made me have a laught! xD
---
That all is basically the explorer experience! ;)
---
Injectors are instant. And I see you edited in MTCs later, but even those you can extract for a profit so who cares. It wasn't a patch note.
---
I'm lost when it comes to stuff like this, is this a good or bad sight? [https://imgur.com/Eqyw4ok](https://imgur.com/Eqyw4ok)
---
Teleporting into null from thera and dunking some guys that are stuck in space with no way to move is not really HTFU.
---
Teleporting into null from thera and dunking some semi-afk ratter is not really HTFU.
---
Very little about modern eve is HTFU.
---
keep that hole krit. verry save. my draugur gang likes krit holes to kill stupid caps.
---
and can you finaly stop pretendeing wh space is save. 
---
If its so save, come here have a farmhole and good luck farming. More content for me.
---
Dude could have spent the ISK on the crystal ball instead and would have seen this coming
---
I'm a pirate.
---
People will probably log in around the same time that they used to meaning the peaks are going to be affected. Im not arguing against your entire post, you are correct. But they will impact, dunno by how much by its a pure positive impact on the PCU, no downside and it will bring out more players than would play the game at that moment, i.e., people who have taken a break will most likely log on to get that SP which means the number will get more inflated.
---
And honestly, I cant even count how many times I logged on to get that free SP but just forgot about it and let the client be on for hours. 
---
So the PCU will get a positive effect (dont know with how much though) but the MAU/DAU will most def get a big bump. Which is why those numbers where used by CCP.
---
I like that CCP receives a bunch of hate then offers those haters and even worse solution. 
---
Age of Chaos confirmed.
---
The guy posted 5 buffs to his preferred fleet. He is in no way impartial or supported by the wider nullsec.
---
do you even hunt in nullsec? cause I think you are pulling this out of your ass
---
Wow fucking minus 7 for sharing the sentiment of at least half the posters. Love Reddit.
---
Got my invite, tried to install, device not compatible... Lol, they cant even get Eve Mobile right
---
...and there you have it.
---
It's easy to support changes that are bad for the game in general when you are too selfish and/or stupid to see beyond your own immediate interests.
---
If you don't care about the success (and at this point, that pretty much means SURVIVAL) of the game, you probably shouldn't be weighing in on discussions about it.
---
Do people think it's worth having Eve on an SSD? I'm trying to free up space and considering moving it from my SSD to my HDD, instead. It's not like there are tons of loading screens in this game. Thoughts?
---
Each box is one file. The bigger the box, the larger the file. Click on anything that seems abnormally large, and it'll tell you what that file actually is. Decide if you need it still, and delete it if not. Repeat until you have no large boxes left.
---
June MER (came out in July) GSF was not at top. He did not move. There is your evidence.
---
point proven - its retarded
---
wow great argument!
---
Lol, yeah... my "day trip" turned into an extended adventure.
---
So that's how it works, thank you! :)
---
He will never admit he's just trying to buff stukas.
---
I love how all these people who never gave a shit enough to post here suddenly found a shit to give and instead they decide to throw it. Lmao.
---
lolwut
---
I just don’t care about the crab that wants to crab in safety and not contribute anything else to the game. They’re the ones leaving. They won’t be missed.
---
CCP have done ban waves that were 10x larger than this before.
---
Why does it have to die?
---
How about male other fleets better instead of buffing one fleet to be the best with no counters.
---
That's a real long-winded way of saying **My snuffed out all will lose easy JF kills**
---
Lets put it this way.  There have been 4 sundays in the last 13 years under 30,000 PCU.  The last two weeks, one week in aug 2016 just before Alphas, and then 2006.
---
Wait, so if I'm dropping out of warp on a target, instead of mashing my right click, I can hover over the target in space with the radial and just click orbit 20k when it ungreys? Does this work on the overview as well? I rarely use the radial menu.
---
He will never admit that.
---
yikes
---
also learn how to use an apostrophe.
---
Olmeca links to thread where he responded to the most common responses during chaos era. Olmecas response actually answers most of the questions and says that no playstyle should outbalance the others. 
---
You then deliberately start off by referring to the point where he called the majority of eve players "farmville players", and chose to focus on that exact statement rather than actually giving critique to his main arguments.
---
ITT: A roller coaster of emotion.
---
the menus of the radial menu change on the fly
---
for example when titan bridging you can open the radial menu before the bridge is up, and when the bridge goes up the top menu is gonna change to "take bridge"
---
so yeah whats your sugesting is already in the game via the radial menu, would be great to have it for the regular right click, tho
---
I’ve not met or heard a single soul who has bitched about not being able to kill a capital with 4 frigs lmao.
---
Bring back GCLUB
---
yeah but industrials are such a pain in the ass to move. whatever i'll deal with it, but they're fucking enormous and seeding mids is gonna be awful for a lot of people. then again, cyno indys are pretty common
---
&gt;do you even hunt in nullsec?
---
In NPSI fleets for years, both big and medium size. Don't do nano gangs, pretty pointless doing that in the era of capitals online, and I refuse to be one of those moron nano gang pilots who bitch and complain here on reddit that they can't kill a capital in their group of 3 frigates.....
---
They never stated that. This is just your mental gymnastics. 0/10 please stop you are scaring the children.
---
It wasn’t a DDos. Teamspeak channels have a specific numbers limit on how many can join before it mutes it. Ours was set to 100, H1NT’S was set around the same. I didn’t even know it was a thing until it happened to us. Reason he was getting those emails was due to him averaging sub 30 people then overnight getting dog piled by 100+ mouth breathers.
---
I don't give two fucks about Snuff tbh
---
Only idiots died like that, and now idiots can continue to die like that.
---
*flagging intensifies*
---
Im claiming this idea
---
Right. So CCP have been giving no help to Aether Wars in terms of time or subscription users?
---
I think it's dumb that the cyno reveals what's going to be jumping through it.  When it comes to risk vs reward, the person or people who may be looking to fight things coming out of cynos will have 0 risk to consider when they warp to a industrial cyno now.
---
That is, of course, unless there is also a covert cyno waiting to be lit alongside the industrial one.  Either way, I don't really get it.
---
All of the risk is on the hauler on this change.  At least before, a cyno could mean a whole bunch of other shit might be coming with the JF.
---

CCP bandaid best bandaid . Did you forget "you have to lock asteroirds to panic" .

They havent taught me how to code yet I will report back when we get to that part.

Do you not read this reddit? It's like a daily complaint, and has gotten carriers nerfed numerous times over.
---
I'm going to have to learn to use the radial then, thank you for letting me know.

None of that has to do with why they should be able to use Covert Cynos, though

Its still a great skill to have.

Scenario 1: CCP makes change, gets feedback, tweaks it 3 years later

Scenario 2: CCP makes change, gets feedback, tweaks it before it even hits the server
---
&gt;WHAAAA WAY TO FLIP FLOP GOSH CCP YOU SUCK
---
I see people complain from time to time that CCP doesn't pay enough attention to feedback from this subreddit.  This is why. So many of you have simply decided to live in a state of perpetual fanny discomfort. It's small wonder that they don't consider this a viable avenue of feedback with so many of you loudly pandering for appeasement.

The thread he linked to is in a different post.
---
He referred to it in a thread that's about his tone in those responses, which is what we were discussing in this post.
---
And the fact that bots seem to have moved to HS. You need more of them than you did in NS to get the same amount of isk and I started seeing this trend before the blackout, around the VNI change announcement and the drifter thing.
---
The drop from real players is more than those numbers are showing but we need the omega/alpha numbers to actually see whats what.

Ugh so now I'm going to have to haul around t1 industrials to move my jf :|

I hope burgers with anchovies make their way to Fanfest 2020
---
It isn’t. I browse the new section hourly pretty much. I’m also in contact with a large amount of the small gang community.
---
Won't be hard, because for whatever reason CCP doesn't want to add a visual model for a cyno equipped to high slot.
---
It would be kind of Ironic to see Rorquals pushed solely into a role of Heavy tackle for Supers and Titans, but why not.
---
Umami Urmami

Well, turds. May i have my SPs back plz?
---
&gt;Stop bitching that this game isn't 100% risk free.
---
what risk is there in a T1 industrial lighting a cyno that isn't there with a T1 frigate or even noobship lighting a cyno
---
I still prefer that to having to train bombers and cyno 5 across all chars for a long cyno chain. Also T1 industrials are about 1/20th of a bomber hull in terms of ISK.
---
My fucking sides man
---
&gt; This will solve the most important issue raised...
---
Of all the issues, _that_ was the most important raised? I get vigils can be important but geez.
---
&gt; note: this means that Jump Freighters will not be able to jump to covert cynos as we originally planned. This is an alternative solution, not an additional one.
---
Why??? 
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
I’m getting more and more perplexed by the thought process behind this whole situation. Are we just pulling ship classes out of a hat for this?
---
It'd be an interesting option, I think. 
---
Just thinking about what the difference from regular JF should be.
---
no way thera
---
triangulation. Take three known points on your 3d space, make a plane, plot target point in that plane to get to by figuring out the distances from each of the three is where you wanna be,  someone better then i can explain how you tell id you are sub or super plane though, id just be lazy and burn my engines to see if i got closer or further away. I can fly a titan but fuck 3d spacial geometry
---
They are talking about the people complaining that they won't be able to covert cyno their JF anywhere. 
---
The risk from a regular cyno only exists if you are an idiot anyway.
---
They will add a cyno beacon so JFs can jump direct to 4-4.
---
Just for the chaos.
---
I hope you made the best with it!
---
Some of the best moments one has in eve happens when you go totally out the rails and the "plan" you made for the evening blows over.
---
F in chat for all the krabs who injected covert ops and cyno v due to lack of patience
---
My point was VERY CLEARLY stated that it addresses people talking about wanting to keep covert cynos. I didnt in any way bring up some point about noobships or Frigates being more/less risky than Indy's.
---
Will be a T2 orca in a few years.
---
That is the thing. Lolmeca talks a big game about making null less safe. But it is less safe for everyone EXCEPT him.
---
Let Jump Freighters bridge other Industrial ships. Then comes the age of Battle Badger drops.
---
That is correct. But I have yet to actually see a good argument as what the actual damage to the economy is with faucets so..
---
&gt; you have to lock asteroirds to panic
---
To be fair, this solves a pretty major issue that arose with combat rorquals being able to hold down a super for 5 min with no counter play.
---
Classic dad move. "Stop crying or I'll give you something to cry about!"
---
I see this particular strain of stupidity often, in many different games.
---
You realize that everyone CAN'T be "isk positive", right? (unless you're talking about individuals' zkill stats, which you don't seem to be)
---
Every time someone gets a kill, someone else gets an equal loss - the ONLY reason going isk positive has been so common up to this point is because of the existence of krabs and any other players whose playstyle doesn't revolve around pvp. Yet, you simultaneously proclaim the importance of going isk positive and the irrelevance of losing the krabs that make it possible for you to go isk positive.
---
Either start thinking harder or stop posting in threads discussing issues of great space-importance.
---
wait, this is an "even worse solution"?
---
i simply nodded and said "good" when i read the changes.
---
I mean, you were the one who came on here calling people out by name. You are really going to play the victim here?
---
Thanks! I am on the road to Dominix as we speak.
---
Let me rephrase that.
---
There is 0 risk whatsoever involved at any point in lighting a cyno with a T1 indy, so how does forcing it instead of covops/bombers makes the game more risky?
---
Speculation about the Jita 4-4 remodel.
---
You can't trick me into grinding my own beef just to make my burgies taste a bit better. 
---
WTB ground anchovies
---
Oh lol I thought you meant isk more generally, ie: things that give you things to sell on the market. Yea, I see why you hate easy ratting isk. Its the biggest source of inflation by far especially since it can be botted easily in subcaps (although not as effective as before)

No u. Pvp is the only play style that’s relevant. Crabs aren’t people. They’re crabs meant to be farmed and destroyed. The blackout was a blessing from bob to us. It was written in the great bob book of a return the great blackness. That great blackness will be used to penetrate the crabness and destroy that which is vile.
---
So the caldari are basically fucking with space time and the trigs are the Yuuzhan Vong from star wars books.
---
Cringe cyno vigils are CCP’s priorities ok, not gameplay
---
Their reasoning to flop is the issue. They should just say capitals can't fit a cyno. The current iteration is beyond stupid.

I guess they met their goals for injectors bought

I care about the health of the game. Probably more than Hilmar come to think of it.

I've been winning Eve for a little while here, what happened to cynos? Got a quick link or 2 minute explanation to both covert and standard cyno changes?

Yeah that's my bad, I misrepresented what i wanted to convey. See this message: https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cvrz6q/cyno_update_industrial_cynos/ey641mr/
---
 You're honestly just some moron sperging out on reddit, with some insanely bad ideas formed through cherrypicking stats to suit your rants.   
---
hey look i got to use it on you :p
---
The opportunity cost is you risking your 3bil capital ship.
---
Why is it worse?  (Not a JF pilot.  really curious)
---
Imagine logging into eve in 2019

I just assumed it was cloaked.

That's the ore for a wreathe. As long as you can build at/near your mids, it's less of an issue.

Lol.
---
YEAH! FUCK THAT CUM DRIBBLING TWAT WAFFLE!
---
Industrial hulls are very big to start seeding around. You have to give up 20k M3 for every mid if they start dying.
---
It's mostly just another crap solution, why go through the effort of a new cyno type and then still restrict it to another niche ship class. Nobody ever had an issue with noobship cynos in the context of JF logistics.
---
They keep rejecting my merge requests :(
---
You dont really though, you care about preserving your playstyle like all players, if you really cared about the health of the game you wouldn't be balled up in a gigantic coalition.
---
Work on it, come up with a more believable lie.

Maybe they'll STFU from now on and quit bitching. It could always be worse

---
It's only risky to idiots, like it is now. 
---
Those idiots that get killed on lowsec stations. The difference with the new change is that the idiot could have given themselves a handicap by using a cyno that doesn't appear on the overview. 
---
Using a normal one now gives the idiot the same chance to die as it always has.
---
JF using covert cynos might have been a steep skill investment but man, talk about easy mode logistics, especially with the blackout in play.
---
Well one shows up on your overview, one doesn't. These are basic things.
---
Caveat: I assume Indy Cynos will function the same as regular cynos do now, buy with ship restrictions.
---
or what, you gonna unsub? great
---
Well that’s dumb. Guess it’ll be stuck with needing that blue donut of friendly citadels in order to move jfs now. Was really looking forward to the options the covert cyno opened up for small group logistics.
---
0m3 of any bullshit, click a button get a noobship. What's the issue with being able to fit those freighter cynos to noob ships?
---
the apostle was bait, same with the leshak. he was on comms with them the whole time waiting to drop, and started calling targets. that's what i understood from the little bit of russian and the way the fleet fight went down when the drops started happening

That's a funny way of saying fighting like hell before we got booted out of Dek. But hey, I get it you like cool-aid. XD

The majority of this sub belong to a certain playstyle so you get that the more toxic this sub is...
---
Dont throw stones in glasshouses. People didnt need to be uber assholes around all these changes but they chose that path. Now its backfiring and we have to make posts about peoples feelings?
---
But that aside, people should be more civil in general sure.

Yay, burned all my saved up sp ~750k on two accounts to train for covert cyno frigs, yay.

---
Where do I get my quests then?  What's the overarching plotline that CCP is leading my character down?
---
Perhaps you should actually understand what a "Themepark MMO" is before attempting to throw the term around.
---
Hint: Themepark isn't a synonym with "easy".
---
&gt;so? there should be mechanics in place that balance personal effort vs coordinated effort
---
There are.  You didn't like that the balance required you to put forth effort into things like "target selection" and "when to attack vs when to retreat".  So, you needed the game to hide you (and soon block response to you).  Others did not have this limitation, and there's a ton of dead things on zKill from before blackout to prove it.
---
&gt;a select few did. the average member of a large group tho: not at all.
---
What effort did your average hunter put forth?  'Cause I've seen the wrecks left behind by the \~10% that were good, and the wrecks of the \~90% where the effort was to say "Let's roam to Eso today!!".
---
dude just seed a bpc and like 40m3 of ore (seriously thats how much ore for a sigil)
---
They wont though, because the same thing happened with Aegis sov.  They got their wish list almost to a T, and afterwards people hated it.
---
Same thing will happen again and again.  Players cry asking for something, CCP caves in, players hate getting what they asked for.
---
So the plan is to mid at citadels/stations only, move a decent amount of minerals there, build a large amount of suicide industrials with compressed minerals.
---
JFs being able to use covert cynos in the age of no null sec local was fucking stupid.
---
Good fishing spots, though.
---
Industrials are no fun to move around, they are also big, so not easily seeded.
---
Yeah, fuck EVE players. Insufferable cunts, the lot of them.
---
Logs... always the logs.... best thing is if you turn on NTFS compression they go from gigs of space to a few megs.
---
One point that I would like to point out that I feel you didn't touch on in your analysis here. You make no mention of how botters create new accounts when they get banned so they break even at best although they probably are the largest reason numbers aren't flatlining right now
---
Right the full counter because you want them to lose all of there tank if they want to use haws? Yea that's completely dum, your want to limit someones fit because he can make it to shit on a certain group. That is a shit change, ill dumb it down. Its like saying lets play rock paper scissors, playing rock into paper, then yelling at the guy about how overpowered paper is saying you should either be naked if you want to play paper or you have to unfit your paper module so i can have a good time and win.
---
Preach it! r/eve is stuck in a perpetual black hole of bittervet (inb4 assuming that the people bittervetting actually play the game). It's toxic as hell and people here need to fucking chill.
---
For one, JFs can't jump to covert cynos now. That means your loot piñatas are much more visible than they would have been. But hey, industrials can fit cynos now.
---
(Personally I agree with this, keep it up)
---
Seems like some people are still playing checkers. They don't understand the difference between a T1 indy lighting a cyno and a covops lolololol
---
And what about those that were okay with the steep skill and isk requirements?
---
People jump on the PCU as an indicator of the health of the game because it's the only metric we can see. Everything else is hidden. In reality, we have no idea how healthy the game is. We only know how much fun we individually are having. No fun=EVE is dying.
---
Everyone else just shrugs and hits the undock button.
---
Keep Asset Safety the way it is.
---
wait.  What exactly is wrong with this?  And freighter cyno meant exclusively for freighters?   What is bad about it?
---
Less cargo space, increased isotope usage, shorter range, 4x cost.
---
And way more failures than CCP
---
nah it doesnt fit. im holding a class on how to properly shitpost (and also gudpost too), you should attend. Bill's invited too.
---
Oh fuck off
---
Cite your sources.
---
Feel free to listen to CCP Rise on Talking in Stations. I believe that's where he said specifically that was the reason. But yeah just my mental gymnastics 😂😂😂
---
 I HAVE EMBRACED CHAOS AND IT HURTS WHEN I PEE.
---
* Not all stations have manufacturing facilities.
---
* 40m3 is a lot more than clicking the "noobship" button (or docking and undocking if NPC)
---
It doesn't need to be an issue at all though. What's wrong with JFs using noobships or T1 frigates as cynos? Why restrict this freighter cyno module to industrials?
---
well it felt good to use it so that is all that matters to me
---
Cynos, that can be titan birdged to, or jumped to with caps can now only be lit by force recons and black ops BSs.  
---
Jump freighters can now jump to a special cyno that can only be lit by other industrial ships. ( or, normal cynos lit by recons/blops)
---
They don't get completely risk free covops bombers cynos in deep safes.
---
idk who to root for at this point
---
so these damn recharge Nereus are not going away
---
I'll probably just keep calling you retarded, mogoloid
---
=)
---
Fuzzmiester's comment needs more visibility. Throw that compressed ore, a cyno or two and a few BPCs into the explorer frigate of choice (400m3 cargo space unexpanded) then travel to wherever.  Of course you still have to build it but that can be solved depending on location.
---
shows the average iq of the goon player
---
JF pilots bitched that they would have to now train into cov ops cyno (a fairly skill intensive train vs. regular cyno)
---
But said training got them 100% safety via covert cynos and black out
---
The new industrial cyno is a beacon like the OG cyno and its easier to train into.
---
AMARR IS NOW T3 AND ITS TRIGGERING ME.  REEEEE MINMATAR.
---
My man, if you for a second just forget all about narratives and divisions in the game and just treat every player like human beings, then perhaps you can understand why we have been saying " DO NOT REMOVE IT". We can sit here and hurl shit at WHs for having to deal with something that will make your lives harder, for no other reason than all your laughs and shitty comments the past month.
---
Or we can try to not be ignorant douchebags and back your play because we understand that you know your space better than us and certainly better than CCP.
---
yeah but so does jerking off but there's a time and place for everything mate
---
Yea! If I'm not having fun, no one should!
---
... fucking children.
---
will i need cyno V?
---
Indeed.
---
SO IS BLUEING MOST OF EVE REEE
---
Half cargo, can fit normal cloak?
---
No, jumping your JF out of docking range of a citadel in nullsec is fucking stupid.
---
Covert vs not-covert only affects the lowsec end of the chain.
---
&gt; It's only risky to idiots, like it is now.
---
What risk? The cyno? The noobship it’s on? The tritanium he forgot to take out of his cargo? 
---
Reducing a risk level of 0 still leaves you with 0 risk.
---
4x cost is a little unreasonable, the hull would be like 10b+ more than a fit super
---
It's true, for some spots you might be in trouble. I'll run some dotlan analysis later but if you're delivering to NPC (my experience, PushX) you're probably never more than 1j away from one.
---
you're probably moving around in a ceptor. so 40m3 is free, all base ceptor holds are bigger. sure, it's slightly more effort, but shouldn't be a problem.
---
* 75 - 100k space (10x a blockade runner, 1/3rd of a JF)
---
* Can fit its own covert cyno (so it can potentially bring in black ops help or have escorts catch up to it).
---
* Can fit covert cloaking device.
---
* +1 to warp core strength per jump freighter level (so it's slippery). 
---
* Cost of around 3bn ISK.
---
In other words, much smaller cargo for the ability to be extremely hard to pin down when operating in nullsec / lowsec. 
---
Anything which removes or reduces the need for a chain of blue space or friendly citadels if you want to live deeper into nullsec.
---
No, this new module requires Cyno 1
---
And there's a million other ways to solve that problem.  Like "can't fit panic and heavy scram at the same time".
---
yeah I'm just basing that on the pricing difference between t1 and t2 industrials, and t1 and covops ships.
---
Since a JF is kind of technically a T2 ship already, hard to say that the 4x would still be valid, so I suppose you are correct.  It would still likely come with a cost increase to be able to fit a high-slot covert cloak though.
---
I guess I am actually, I had misinterpreted the discussion at hand and also your first response. Oh well, however I still think that you should really look past that remark, and instead maybe use your own lightly aggressive remark back, as its of no real meaning to either of you :)
---
I love them. Great if you are able to gun the citadel you are jumping to.
---
No need to assume, they state it in the post:
---
&gt;Now Industrials will offer a very affordable option with **a cyno that appears in overview and on the map**. We are very glad to preserve this tradition and appreciate the community emphasis on doing so.

If you can is a big if.

I think the market for "Hardcore" might be higher than it seems, but CCP went about it the wrong way - the satisfaction of doing something hardcore comes from prevailing against great challenge or high risks, like permadeath modes in some games. 
---
What CCP calls "high-risk" and "hardcore" is more akin to masochism than anything else; they expect you to suffer frequent and unavoidable losses, and for some reason keep coming back for more.  
---
The Wild West was a good example of a hardcore setting; it was a lawless frontier where survival was based on your own merits.
---
EVE is more like a ghetto; it's a lawless frontier where survival is based on not randomly getting stabbed to death for your shoes.
---
the people that stopped logging in were the bots fool.
---
Yet people still will wonder why they can't have covops JF. Lol
---
Battle Nereus is no joke.
---
I'm assuming you need implants for this? 
---
All Lvl 5's and you are still over on PG with this fit.
---
They *are* gameplay. They are things people do ingame, they are as much a part of the game as any other community-driven event. Just because cyno vigils are something CCP didn't personally implement doesn't mean they're not gameplay.
---
Well when you put it like that...
---
Haul the materials. Make sure your cyno alts can manufacture. Far less volume.
---
i wish they dont step back
---
As opposed to the typical olmeca fanboi?
---
CCP you're drunk go home
---
TO THE JUMP FREIGHTER ITSELF.
---
Read more than a single sentence, dude. T1 cyno lets everyone know you're in system and a direct warp-in on top of you. 
---
If you aren't an idiot, this is not a problem. If you *are* an idiot, then you're more likely to die in this scenario than you are with a covert cyno that doesn't tell everyone in system where your 9-10 billion isk pinata is.
---
But the covops cyno was even harder? How can you be complaining about it being *easier* than the original changes?!
---
I think a lot of people will be in the same boat as you, it's one of those "screwed if you do, screwed if you don't" moments. If you didn't use your SP then you would have trained Cyno 5 normally to get ready for the September release but that skill is now pretty useless for you if you are only doing logistics work on that alt. If you injected it either with bought injectors or the SP you saved up from the Weekly giveaways then you are also boned unless you buy extractors.
---
The only acceptable way to die in a site is to a competent bomber imo. Everything else can be gotten away from
---
People were complaining due to cyno 5 requirement train time. The covert cyno would have been a much welcomed change for JF Pilots.   
---
Now you will have to get an industrial ship blown up on each jump along the way.
---
Will just take CCP 5 years to reverse the non net positives. Also will take another 5 years to remove the spaghetti code that will cause problems for the next several years to come.
---
Honestly that’s kind of a minor detail in the face of what we’ve been presented. 
---
We’ve gone from a very significant increase in skills and cost, to a significant increase in complexity and effort.
---
At this point, they’ve already decided to make a new cyno. I see very little reason to not just allow industrial cynos on most (if not all) ships. The Indy cyno itself already addresses all the problems and concerns CCP brought up with cynos and jump freighters. Why add so much more on top of that?
---
The celebrated poopers of New Eden.
---
feck off goonie...we know u dont like blacks,feckin racist
---
The fact you can flag posts made by CCP devs on their own forums is the most CCP thing ever.
---
How do you fit neuts on there with the PG being maxed out basically?
---
&gt; Just let noob ships fit the industrial cyno.
---
Also, let noobships fit doomsday weapons and covert ops cloaks.
---
Since the covops cyno was so short and didn't show up on overview, you'd lose very few cyno ships using it.  Going back to an overview-visible cyno means it dies from the elite PVPers in lowsec.
---
not the belt daddy!
---
Too bad Panfam cant bribe Taperiums leaders into raising manufacturing taxes so all the line members move their manufacturing to Panfam space so they can actually turn a profit.
---
Why would you do that? They hadn't even made a dev blog. All there was so far was a speculative forum post.
---

---
The stupid, holy shit it makes my brain hurt. I thought being in TEST would inoculate me but no, CCP always finds ways to beat low expectations.
---
Basically this. And even then depending on ship/fit you can may be able to manage.
---
The botato makes great salad! o7
---
It's not really, most people here don't know what they are talking about, there is this weird assumption that people are warping to JF cynos and ganking JF's which I have no idea where it comes from. 99.9999% of the time you are jumping a JF to a cyno that is on a structure and you simply immediately dock.  There is no risk.  
---
There may be a couple extremely niche scenarios (like dropping a KS) where a covert could have changed he game a bit I guess; as though people are dropping KS's with no support fleet...  Also the vast majority of JF pilots would never be in this scenario, kind of a non-issue imo.
---
It will however be a pain in the ass to haul dozens of industrial ships to each citadel that acts as a mid for when you loose cynos (everyone had to do this with noob ships anyway before a recent patch).  CCP just added that "board my corvette" option and I guess subsequently made it obsolete.
---
Because in the interview with CCP Rise he said they were announcing this change early so people would have time to get the necessary skills.

God you people are dumb.
---
Inject in haste, repent at leisure.
---
Sure thing. Expect a text in a few months.
---
I really want a t2 orca to be a thing
---
It’s not CCP that makes the Newbros quit though? And it’s not the quality of the game itself either.
---
I mean, getting a black ops bomber volleyed off a station every time you went to Jita would suck pretty badly. 
---
Industrials are cheap I suppose, and you don't need to shove several billion in SP training into all your cyno alts. Should be a good market for cheap industrials + cynos in the lowsec systems near Jita now.
---
Yeah, turned out ok... ended up in Stain with a few hundred mil in ISK in my cargohold.
---
How long before people bitch about the m3 of packaged industrials for their cyno chains now?? 😂
---
Its not a big effort for people running tons of logistics, the extra time gets watered down by the amount you use it. But for someone who sometimes move their JF its a big nerf.
---
But all of this is besides the point. Its just tedious. Why make more tedious things when you could have just as easily allowed this new mod to sit on any ship. Its a new mod that will only allow industrials to jump so there are no issues whatsoever with allowing it to sit on any shiptype.
---
I'm gonna see if I can meme on some Triglavians with it later today or tomorrow... Should be amusing. Or painful. Maybe both.
---
1400s are really fun guns to use though.
---
This is a good idea. Equipping a cyno should make a ship glow or something.
---
Not anymore.
---
okay lets have a look at the responses from both sides  
---
**the goon:**
---
\&gt;shut up retard
---
\&gt;You boosh excavator drones; congratulations..
---
\&gt;Do you READ the bullshit you spew? I mean this not to come across bad but there's no way not to. You act lik,e a spoiled child who figured out you can kick people on the playground and run to the teacher for protection, it's truly pathetic.
---
Tell me, do these actually add any real value to the discussion, or are they just piss-poor remarks at people who would rather take cheap-shots than introduce their own arguments?
---
You can’t cyno in Jita. You can only cyno out.
---
No, theyre actually classified as 'wingy bits'
---
Just remove all ships except noob ships, balance solved.
---
Where do I get my medal.
---
Or just display a model similar to how turrets are. It at least gives some counterplay to dilligent pilots who will look at a ship to help determine fit.
---
40m3 is a lot less than the previous citadel option of bringing in a pile of frigates.
---
@op, thoughts on how many of the unsubbed/not-logged-in accounts are attributed to botters?
---
&gt;note: this means that Jump Freighters **will be able** to jump to covert cynos as we originally planned. This is an **additional solution**
---
CCP plz
---
Mining is tedious, why not have asteroids mine instantly? idk dude, this isn't real life, the goal isn't for everyone to be comfortable and happy. You may see the tedium as mindless but it does open up real possibilities/strategies for cyno seeding, cynoship sharing, for local industrialists to seed the ships themselves, etc etc.
---
maybe they are not interested in those players. To hell with all those industrialists. Everything would be simpler with a few P2W transactions. 
---
Maybe, but they should tell us.

---
The tutorial missions mentioned in there are worth doing if you haven't played in a while.  They will set you up with 10M isk, a few frigates, and a destroyer.  Included in those frigates is a mining frigate (the Venture) if you want to start down that path.
---
&gt; Where do I get my quests then?
---
From whoever tells you what to do and when to do it. 
---
&gt; There are
---
No. 
---
&gt; You didn't like that the balance required you to put forth effort into things like "target selection" and "when to attack vs when to retreat"
---
It´s you who does not like to spend that effort. That´s why you surround yourself with people who do it for you.
---
&gt; So, you needed the game to hide you (and soon block response to you)
---
wat?
---
&gt; What effort did your average hunter put forth?
---
He creates his own financial infrastructure, does his own logistics, buys his own ships, does not get SRP, creates his own content, comes up with his own tactics and strategies. Behind every dumb krab kill there are hours of work the "hunter" (whatever fucking buzzword that has become) has to put in before he even undocks and decides where to go. That´s personal effort. He spends it to create content. You spend it to fill your pockets while leaching of the coordinated effort of the 1000s who are just as inept as you are. That´s why you´re a whiny entitled bitch. That´s why the "hunters" just lol at your first world problems.
---
So changes to cloaking soon then? Cool.
---
The typos in that release inspire confidence.
---
Jump midpoints usually do not offer industrial facilities
---
This is the stupidest fucking article I have ever read. I'll save everyone a click:
---
Register on their site, wait to see if you get an invite code, install app.
---
&gt;Should be a good market for cheap industrials
---
Clearly the T1 industrial manufacturer lobbyists did a better job greasing CCP's palms than the cov ops lobbyists.
---
Winter AT pls, tia.
---
Sharing fake news and making a cogent argument are two different things.  I am not sure this you aren't reinforcing the original point that education is lacking.  Making a cogent argument using facts is not the same as ascertaining whether the facts are in fact correct or not.  One is about using facts, the other about verifying an validating them.  Those skills are not necessarily correlated.
---
There is, however, a different argument to be made.  That those who are too old to have experience using the internet to research more deeply the articles they read.  So they are prone to believe what is reported to them as fact despite the fact reporters are incredibly poor at doing just that.  It is just that we didn't know that as well when the research tools weren't readily at our fingertips.
---
Does your brain actually work this way? How many helpers do you require to perform normal daily activities?
---
Two reasons:
---
1. Certain people get really salty that they do not get a kill mark for shooting a Corvette. There’s a reason I named all my Corvettes “No Killmark for You.” Lots of people complain about this on reddit, the forums, and in game.
---
2. CCP loves to increase the tedium of certain tasks, especially the logistics tasks that burn people out. So, if they make the industrial cynosural field generator fit on a large ship that is hard to carry around and seed in advance, that is a good thing using CCP logic. CCP wants people to have to move Cyno ships into place ahead of time, or build them in midpoints, or buy them in midpoints, etc.
---
Cool cool very unique take, I appreciate the nuance and analysis you provided, it game me a perspective I haven't seen before.
---
Nope
---
Well this is definitely the worst but I don't see how it could possibly be the best.
---
Disgust.jpg
---
as opposed to Olmecas dismissal of every single opposing view as coming from a "spodbrained nullbear linemember"
---
ALL OF YOU ARE BAD(IM WORSE, THOUGH).
---
You are not making sense here. It literally will bring nothing about of the things you are saying. Stop with this emergent gameplay BS please.
---
You're obviously not a wormholer -- or you'd know that the amount of risk, time, and effort involved, puts wormhole content in a place where if the rewards weren't worth it, no-one would bother.
---
As 
---
If it was easy-as-piss like nullsec, wormhole space would be a lot more lively.  But you can't have 500 caps to hold your hands should you get dropped on in J space.  Therefore none of you idiots come out to play.
---
12T ISK divided up amongst most of jspace sounds about right, considering the risk vs reward.  The only issue I see here is that you're too pansy to come and join us.  WH space isn't for the half-assed, or half-baked.  It requires commitment.
---
Here's a novel idea, roll back on the thick as shit changes instead
---
Fuck that shit.
---
It’s been borked since they went to cloud. I don’t know why it keeps bugging out off and on for 1-2 years and it seems like they don’t either.
---
Word
---
lol ok if you're just gonna declare that as true there's nothing I can really argue
---
Just kill them. It's not like anything besides jump freighters can jump in to kill you.  
---
I am not really sure if I like this change
---
Do you know how JFs get to Jita?
---
They jump to one of ~3-4 lowsec systems that are on the border of Highsec and lowsec, and gate from there. Those systems are well known and easy to camp, because starting farther away via gating greatly increases the travel time of the JF because it's slow as shit.
---
If every time I lit cyno in a 30-40m bomber on one of the stations in these systems I was gonna get blapped by some dick in a tornado, I would be pretty annoyed. 
---
T1 industrials that cost 4m are expendable in the same way that covops bombers are not.
---
Grath... I think you're developing a Constantine complex lately.
---
please refer to said statement
---
and they can call it a blockade runner
---
Nobody was midding anywhere that wasn't a citadel or station anyway.
---
I agree that Cyno Vigils was hardly the most important issue, but some people really hate noob ship cynos because they don’t generate kill marks.
---
Agree. Misread your post as to mean every time you lit a cyno on jita.
---
I like it better, good ;)
---
Not what I said fella. 
---
I'm having plenty of fun in eve, I wouldn't log on to a video game if I wasn't ;)
---
But I like that CCP is trying to fix the broken things and would rather they try and fail than do nothing and let it slowly fail.
---
why would I watch someone give lectures from the book I wrote?
---
in the age of chaos making decisions purely off of the first draft of changes is probably going to burn you again, I would wait until they seem a bit more solid.
---
&gt;Same.  Going to just leave it cooking for covert camping now though.
---
Not using zero y-axis lol.
---
VELATORS OP PLS NERF
---
&gt; Having to haul industrial to all your mids is a bit of a pain
---
Markets will adapt.
---
Relic site loot takes very little space. You can have 1 bil of loot and only be halfway full.
---
Same here. For a ship that can't defend itself, I don't get why it shouldn't be able to take a covert cyno.
---
Will industrial Cynos also work for Rorquals and Orcas?
---
The idea was to use a covert cyno and jump to an area outside of d-scan. Then you can web your JF in to warp and land at the station or gate. The covert cyno isn't seen on overview, so unless someone scans you out, nobody would know you were there.
---
Classic cynos you would have to pick the right station so that you would cyno in docking range and not bounce off the station. With covert cynos you could be able to cyno in to systems that were undesirable mids before due to having kickout stations that had a small docking range. Now you're back to having to use the old style of cyno placement.
---
I'm sorry, is there something untrue about what i said?
---
Eve was increasingly becoming just AI grinders and bittervets.
---
Older players run even more alts now with 'whalers' have multiple dozens. 
---
It's routine to see capitals ratting and mining (dumpstering the profitability for newbies). People cyno capitals on microgangs
---
Autistic krablords posing as 'regular 4fun' players concerntroll about how "blackout is bad for the average Joe!" while they multibox their rorqual fleet around their 15 Athanor belts.
---
And thats why everyone worth thier salt had a citadel in one of those systems to avoid the stations. I never touched those stations after citadels were released. why are you?
---
pretty much, yea.
---
Oh fun, I normally don't find these garbage sites outside of the News subs.

---
&gt; already started training more covert cynos
---
CCP loves players like you.
---
Do we need covert JFs then, so all those newly trained cov ops/recon, cyno 5 alts don't go to waste?
---
Can jump to cov-cyno. Non cov-ops cloak. Less m3 with skills and expanders than JF with Bulkheads, more M3 with Bulkheads than BR with Expanders/+rigs, consider what structures it could launch. More skill intensive and higher bill of materials than JF. A little worse orange fatigue bonus than JF so maybe I don't have cyno 5, an arazu uncloaks, launches drones and begins to orbit my industrial cynos wreck.
---
Would they be useful? Would they be broken? Have they been suggested a million times?

Blackout: happens*

Does that mean you can fit this new cyno on the vigil? Or are they expecting people to change to cyno-Sigils instead?
---
Or just undock a ship instead of shooting nerds with a citadel?
---
Wow... so CCP plans to make a healthy change that would make cap spamming more difficult while making logistics safer and easier, and you morons go bitching and moaning such that they change it to be essentially the goddamn same as it was before. Good job, you fucktarded autists.
---
I think they know their player base.
---
They aren't going to come out and say "we no longer want our game full of empire builders focused on home defense and expansion of wealth because it offers no potential for new player growth"
---
But I feel it's fairly obvious they are actively out to get nullblocs.
---
After all that's who is here squealing about change. 
---
It won't be a quick and easy transition, and it might fail - at least they're trying. 
---
Don't expect an explicit announcement until after it's already succeeded, if it does.
---
Beginning of the end was 2003. Dying ever since
---
Only change is for JF. The rest is still in effect.
---
But honestly. Like you are portraying it like a massive strategic change. Its not. Its just more tedious. For the non "real" JF pilot all this amounts to is that we have to move industrials around to light cynos. And they can be hard to find. You move an alt to an area and try to buy a ship to light a cyno and you pick whatever is available. People wont start seeding industrials in areas just cause maybe someone might sometime use a station in Derelik or whatever. 
---
It will just end up moving industrials through tons of gates in LS, trying to escape gatecamps and what not. 
---
Dont confuse tedium with good gameplay, its really really not. Nothing bad will happen if noobships can use these cynos. Nothing at all. The world wont end. But not allowing it is to introduce yet another shitty mechanic that makes no real sense and if you have enough of those people are gonna grow tired at some point.
---
Saw this coming as soon as people started complaining about the long train time. This is going to be “fun” for a variety of reasons.
---
1. All previous stocks of regular cynos and non-industrial cyno ships are useless. 
---
2. The sort of person who stocks low sec stations with liquid ozone at 1000/unit and 5m ISK Cynosural Field Generator I’s can now stock Nereus hulls for 5m ISK as well.
---
3. This satisfies the crowd who thinks shooting a cyno ship is a major accomplishment. Certain people get really salty that they do not get a kill mark for shooting a Corvette. There’s a reason I named all my Corvettes “No Killmark for You.” Lots of people complain about this on reddit, the forums, and in game.
---
4. CCP loves to increase the tedium of certain tasks, especially the logistics tasks that burn people out. So, if they make the industrial cynosural field generator fit on a large ship that is hard to carry around and seed in advance, that is a good thing using CCP logic. CCP wants people to have to move Cyno ships into place ahead of time, or build them in midpoints, or buy them in midpoints, etc.
---
But hey, at the end of the day, it’s a minor change, it makes sense, and we’ll get over it.
---
Reminded me of this video and made me lol.  
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huJ81Mq2y34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huJ81Mq2y34)
---
I spent like two hours the other night scanning one of these. Even worse than that, the \~70% WHs I scanned all lead to high/low-sec, none to J-space :(
---
&gt; and a properly tanked industrial can let that nado eat station guns for plenty of time before it dies
---
because the nado wouldn´t just bounce and frag you without gun aggro
---
Vigil as in using cynos as a candle, in memorial.
---
Well, hope you got a citadel gunner ready for your cyno.
---
I'm thinking about these. and Suggesting them.
---
Only turboretards die on the stations. There is no problem using stations like the igno station, it's near impossible to fuck up unless you maximum smooth brain and get memed by snuff.
---
CCP Does not want to clutter the game with an extra cyno module to confuse people with which does not function as a literal cyno.
---
Buy some Small Secure Containers. You can anchor them and set a password. Put them in a special safe. Every time you open the can it resets the 30d despawn timer.
---
You have to sit there for 1 minute with a cyno that doesn't show up on overview. You wouldn't have been losing a cyno every time that you lit a cyno.
---
Moving an industrial around to wherever you want to move stuff is going to be a pain in the ass.
---
Since JFs now have their own cyno mechanic, maybe we can allow industrial cynos to be lit in highsec.
---
Except it'll be orca's, not barges
---
Fuck. I really liked Jump Freighters being able to jump to Covert Cynos. The only people that were upset about this were people concern-trolling over something they've likely never done, and meowtiger, for some inexplicable reason.
---
/me rolls in his dozens of isk.
---
Yeah, it will do exactly that. Still, untanked, insured T1 is ez to replace by the hundreds.
---
Where are you fitting your LO? Most ceptors can just about carry enough with their holds.
---
literally any of his posts, not that it matters anyway this is reddit where everyone calls everyone else a retard asshole, so y'know make like a tree and fuck off
---
I have 4GBs of screenshots on Drive C. Also-Eve is eating my disk space despite purging shared cache and stuff.
---
He just said he is using the accounts still with them actively logged in, that’s still fish in the pond, just potentials fish that bite back. I prefer fighting them hunting for ratters/miners any day of the week
---
&gt; Hunters say they love the Blackout, but now few ratters will undock their expensive capitals, so then hunters get little to no capital kills
---
If only there were a killboard to prove how fucking dumb you are.
---
Make the observatory vulnerable when online but invulnerable offline - could be as simply as it being placed adjacent to a citadel so that it tethers when offline. Give it a 15 mins combat timer and a 15 mins offlining timer so you cannot just switch it off to save it. It does not need a timer then because if you online it you must be around to defend it.
---
I know what effect it's having on this subreddit. There's about 50 GSF/TEST/Else posters I've never seen before commenting in every single thread even remotely related to the blackout, and it seems like there's at least a couple everyday posting dumb fucking posts like this.
---
&gt; like dropping a KS
---
You can't fit one of those in a jump freighter
---
Get caught out five seconds after lighting the cyno by some guy in a rifter, spend the next ten minutes with them not breaking your shield regen before you dock up and say "GF" in local.
---
...I may have had one or two of those myself. D:
---
Just put a cyno clownshoe at every mid and you'll rarely lose cynos.
---
imo that's what made them awesome. When they got committed to a fight, it was a huge flex.
---
&gt;Points to new indy cyno
---
Do what now?
---
you thought wrong
---
The problem is that there's been thought-out strategies before and they failed time and time again. Eve's population is very good at exploiting a system for their own maximum benefit. The issues in game are very difficult to address; eg how do you stop the megacoalitions from ruling the game and removing conflict? How do you stop the power of caps/supers as they are now, without rebalances everywhere that are then liable to become issues as well?
---
TBH, throwing some things out just to shake things up is something EVE can use after years and years of stagnation.
---
Now I really want to try one of these burgers.
---
I have a superb Greek lamb recipe that uses anchovies.
---
Yeah, you'd need a specifically cargo fit one, which would probably sacrifice tank but it's not like you'd be carrying anything valuable. You can get a ceptor to the requisite 160m3 by sacrificing a rig and two lows, stiletto would be the only problematic one off the top of my head.
---
Why would orcas care
---
I view them as one in the same. If you are incapable of formulating an argument you are more likely to be incapable of judging someone else's.
---
covert cynos are only up for 60 seconds and dont show on the overview, if you can't find a window to get that in without dying you're trash.
---
&gt; We want more risk in our game
---
Risk for cloaking when?
---
I usually just flick on the PDS for some laughs.
---
You mean that 60 second cyno that doesn't show on the overview?  Like honestly how do you people function when you can't even manage the most base level of sneaky...
---
You can't even imagine someone wants to play eve their own way? You must live under a rock.
---
Dust on PS3 *cringe*
---
Aaaayyyy Macarena
---
It still has a funtion. Cyno which functions but has fitting requirements I.E. Industry ship.
---
What I meant. They do not want to add ontop another cyno which has no function besidds lighting a cyno beacon. But does not function as a jumpable point.
---
OH NO! THE END!?
---
...not again
---
Oh man. I didn't know this word. I always assumed the thing was named after the frigate. TIL what vigil actually means. (although tbf English is not my 1st language)
---
Titan drivebys were the ultimate flex
---
Make this T2 and use per jump freighter specialization level instead
---
Man - Covert Cyno JFs woulda been really, really cool.
---
Be however risk averse and needlessly cautious as you want. I'm not even saying dont, im just pointing out how dumb it is. Go ahead and hack cans in a Titan for all I care.
---
Understandable. It's a niche usage. :)
---
They’re retarded gameplay then
---
&gt; Do you know how JFs get to Jita?
---
I think he just read your original post as "when they cyno into jita".
---
Your point stands, just a misinterpretation of the original text.
---
No.
---
I can fit a normal cloak on any freighter, though?
---
Depends on the location. Anywhere busy (jita entry systems, etc) you'd be eating a loss every time.
---
Are you the kindof person that’d post the “cyno is not yet lit” cringe poem in local or something?
---
Why are you going to debate stuff that's already locked in? 
---
Yes, your agenda is personal. Even if you claim to be representing a constituency, you are doing something you think is a good idea - your  own items that you developed, not something that was crowdsourced or you're presenting on behalf of another group.
---
Bro, if you think that your campaign and video had an impact on that stuff, you're huffing your own farts. Even if they're telling you that, don't assume it's true. :) 
---
If I believed everybody who told me they voted for me, I'd have beat Aryth in votes.
---
bro 😎💪
---
The part I hate most about his change is it has led to every mouth breather starting the grief cycle over.
---
How about no?
---
amazeballs
---
Trivago.
---
This. Sure, you get less for that loot, but you save time having to pick it up giving you more time to explore.
---
It won't even be that hard to make a chain, just put a clownshoe at every jump and unless you get unlucky you should be losing cynos almost never. It's still going to be a bit annoying to move without a chain though, I guess you can just dst the industrials around or something.
---
So my point....   QED?  ;)
---
Just a quik question... how often do you fly JF´s by yourself ? Where do you get your goods from ?
---
A lot of people enjoy them, and they're a good way for people to connect and bond over their mutual respect for a person who touched their lives. You don't have to personally like cyno vigils to acknowledge the fact other people like them.
---
No high slots on freighters and jump freighters.
---
The best part is people were bitching about the Covert cyno option for JFs and wanting a t1 hull, and I think it’s hilarious CCP meme’d on them with this change. 
---
Wish they had kept it the way it was, but have fun hauling your 20km3 haulers in your 350km3 JF. 
---
Or bitching about having to research BPOs, or training production skills or something.
---
Chaos4csm
---
Good one. I mean, it's industrial right?
---
Or maybe just make Jita 4-4 have a built-in industrial cyno just in case everyone lights one and make everyday like Christmas
---
Classic is overhyped
---
COmpare pricing differences between T1, T2 and T3 cruisers and there'd not really be that much of a difference in pricing. Plus, nothing stops another "T2 freighter" from filling a new role.
---
Oh, you're one of those special people who think null blocs hand out supers and rorquals to everyone who shows up.
---
No wonder you don't know what a Themepark MMO is.
---
o no its even easier. panic could breaks all locks and prevent further locks you know like a cloak does.
---
I would rather mine an entire Keepstar's worth of build mats using a rookie ship than JF. That has nothing to do with your idea never being taken seriously by CCP.
---
Even then one of them is basically an instant to the gate, gotta be like koala levels of smooth brain to die
---
Lmao if they roll it back it’ll be business as usual again for us and we’ll have a couple months of amazing tears like yours to look back on ❤️
---
I did train on 4 characters for cyno 5 for 12 days.. and I don't like the change. But if they do the change to industrial cynos I think my idea might be a solution to get it sorted
---
So where the popcorn stand and the soda stand? Cause without that is be no fun to go there :D
---
there's not a lot of risk tied up in a t1 industrial that can afk passive tank 800dps. it's just that it's kind of a pain and seems dumb
---
t1 industrial ship only
---
I see a nice space Screenshot , i upvote
---
Players who adapt to changes?
---
NO ITS NOT YOU CAN'T RUN FROM A FIGHT YOURE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE. 
---
IT ALSO MAKES ME FEEL BETTER TO DISPLACE THE BLAME OF HAVING SO MANY BLUES ON OUR DIPLOS AND CCP, NOW I CAN SAY IM A PVPER BUT NOT BEING ABLE TO FIND SHIT TO KILL IS OUT OF MY HANDS.
---
So you don't fly your goods by yourself.. other people do it for you. Maybe those people don't want to have crazy big cynoships, that need to be hauled. There are crazy nullsec regions like moist, where people have up to 7 or 8 mid points.
---
It’s like they just want to provide us with the maximum amount of salt. It’s beautiful.
---
I acknowledge that other people like them, I also acknowledge those same people are cringe and retarded :)
---
wow such a riveting and spectacular chaotic change, surely i will now log in and pay for this game once again
---
Anchovies are pretty soft, you can smush them into a ground state with very little effort.
---
Keep it up Olmeca. You have my votes!
---
yeah this basically
---
Cringy and retarded for wanting to get together with people and morn the loss of someone who's mutually important to them?
---
You need to up your reading comprehension. How on earth is allowing a Jump Freighter to jump to an Industrial ship the same as before. Every other ship is still needing to use a Recon or a Blops...  
---
&gt; Good job, you fucktarded autists. 
---
Are you angry for the sake of being angry?
---
Maybe I don't give a fuck about the plight of the JF pilot, adjust your pricing as needed, or live closer to a market
---
And asking people to not do it basically guarantees they will...
---
&gt;Do you know how JFs get to Jita?
---
Protip: They don't. They use a blockade runner for that portion of the journey.
---
&gt;Too much indoctrination and not enough **tools** taught

From your original comment. My posts all relate to this bolded word.

Cyno onto cov ops positioned in deep safe, web freighter into warp. Nothing shows up in overview, nothing in local, very very unlikely anything is in d-scan range. Cyno goes down after 1 minute and you cloak up.
---
But people bitched and CCP gave them what they wanted. Basically what they have right now.

Here is my biggest fucking issue with all of this. We've had some very major changes; this being one of the larger ones are we're still not stamped down on what the fuck is happening and it'll be happening within the next "30" days. 
---
"Summer of chaos" is just a nomer given for how they operate on a corporate level so it sounds like this planned out process to fix things. Clearly not the case.
---
No he just likes using you to vent out his frustration with his poor choices
---
Ah, yeah, I forgot about that, it's been about a year since I sat in my Obelisk lol - don't do move ops when I can avoid it.
---
By pressing a module in a video game, and freaking out when that module gets removed and they’d have to find something else to use? Yeah, a little
---
The industrial cyno will be visible both on the map and in the overview. No information on the duration yet.
---
TIL training the old fashioned way no longer exists.
---
Don’t tell them about the shoe dude
---
Also, 40m3 is *ore*. So you need reprocessing PLUS manufacturing.
---
Accurate. Though the industrial cyno realty does make my head hurt.
---
Best post ever :-)
---
Covert Cyno would allow you to jump to systems that you couldn't before due to kickout mechanics with stations. It would also allow you to jump to systems with a cyno inhib as well. I think it was actually a pretty big deal.
---
This might just have to be a "dark before the dawn" situation for EVE. 
---
Its worse because Chaos is forcing play styles to change, namely botting and other multi-account BS with caps and such is being mothballed or recycled. So, we won't be seeing as many logins without those accounts active. The number of players didn't change much probably, but the amount of stuff they are running did. 
---
And this is fine. EVE must change, or it will definitely spiral downward until the servers are shut off. At least this latest push to revamp large swaths of gameplay problems gives us some hope maybe EVE can have a second renaissance, *because the changes will make the game more fun, more accessible to new players, and favor the old husks and their 50 capital alts less.
---
I have played this game for 15 years. I have done everything with any amount of people in any kind of space. And being a nullbloc line member is by far the lowest effort vs maximum return playstyle you can possibly achieve.
---
Provibloc already died to blackout, they have enough people who will log on for pings and have stored up wealth to keep them going for a bit longer, but those people who just do the fleets are going to start quitting entirely, and their srp stockpiles will run out, and then they will be dead for good
---
The pro move before the "Board my Corvette" was to contract your inty alt to yourself, undock and redock.
---
That seems a thousand times more half baked.
---
I'm waiting for them to say how it hurts the "little guy" because they care soooo much.  :-)
---
I couldnt agree more tbqh.
---
The only part I really like about the idea of an industrial corvette is that all the people who don't have anything else to do besides killing JF cynos don't get rewarded with kill marks
---
Good post.
---
Ultimately those subscribers are not in fact benefiting anyone with the way things are. Mutlibox carrier ratters do pony up for the subs which is good for CCP, but overall game health is bad because of stuff like this and results in overall *less* revenue because so many others are unsubbing because EVE blows if it just becomes a sandbox full of end-game krabs.
---
You clearly don't know how covert cynos work so maybe don't roll in with the "Do You KnOw HoW JFs GeT tO jItA?"
---
Haha hol up lemme bring and anchor a raitaru, fit service modules, fuel it and then build an industrial to light cynos with haha.
---
Probs less work to just try and get an industrial to fit into a blockade runner :p
---
You're right. I should get a in game medal for killing logged off cyno ships on NPC stations.
---
Lose the ability to insta warp if you do that though I think.
---
Uh, can you share this 800dps passive tank industrial for? For science?
---
Do a festival cyno or some other dumb shit.
---
adapt or die
---
or... maybe they change it into a kick out station xD
---
not on the ares or malediction. but yes on the stiletto and crow. they just dont have the lowslots (and crow has innate shit align) to do both
---
&gt; your own items that you developed, not something that was crowdsourced 
---
[Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/3/d/1yBNk4pX2TK8ytP0tQhsqFlaTtOQ20Jx9phDncEkJjD0/edit#gid=0) is my agenda. (Which btw, is public as you see. Not a lot of CSMs make their agenda public.)
---
Now notice the "Proposed Mechanical &amp; Item Changes" column. There are 50 ideas in there. Among those, only 7 of them are specifically mine. The rest is crowdsourced, many of which I merely borrowed from others. Btw, not a lot from that column went into the game. Just one very popular idea in the FW section, the Ventures.
---
Meanwhile, take a look at the "problem" column. In that column you'll see a list of stuff which I argued to be problems during my campaign, and way before it. I was very transparent in the campaign, and I didn't do a tactical flip after getting elected. I am representing problems which I advocated to be problems. There is nothing "personal" about any of this. If you can seriously claim I am just pushing my personal agenda, I suspect you might be fallng victim to the same prejudice/koolaid issues your social circle in Eve suffers from.
---
Yea i think we're talkign about using covert cynos, the original thread of this is bitching about getting your 30m cov ops frigate blapped on a station and like, if you cant get a covert ops cyno lit without getting blapped you're in deep shit in eve.
---
Change cloak module to a cycling module. Ship gets a chance to take damage each cycle. Bombers, short cloak time; passive shield sigil, long cloak time.
---
Honestly blue loot in general rubs me the wrong way. I wish it was some other items we worked for that were actually used in the market, similarly with bounties. Get everyone providing something of real value to each other in order to get paid... but I don't really feel too strongly about those. I doubt they'll change.
---
In reality, no one is going to do this.
---
Sure you have.  That's why you think the ship fairy delivers your Hel, and can't use the proper terms for MMOs.  That totally demonstrates your maturity and achievement.
---
When it’s two Hecates going for decloak you just crash back. And then crash back again. And keep crashing back and forth until they get sloppy and you can escape. The only really scary ship is a daredevil because of its webs and scanres, but unless you get a super unlucky spawn you’ll be fine if you know what you’re doing
---
Pleased to see my hard hitting question had the right impact :)
---
That last sentence is gold, I love when people get super melodramatic about a video game forum
---
If we’re being honest, nobody asked or cares
---
god imagine if they just gave out 2.45m xp in a few months back in 2010 or something, shit would be insane
---
&gt; EVE is dying.
---
Dead meme.
---
Proof it.
---
Yeah but moving a new Itty V to replace the old one tho.
---
Yes. Cheetahs scan faster than an astero if you have covert ops at IV, and they’re a lot cheaper. 
---
My recommendation would be to use a cheetah for a while, and once you are confident in your ability to dodge gatecamps and escape from people camping sites, then upgrade. 
---
Btw, to escape from campers just do keep at range 2250m on the can you are hacking so you can cloak up and warp the second anything decloaks on you.
---
Tech 1 industrials with JF cynos — this is a good change.
---
They just dug their own grave with that one.
---
Keep the current podding rules.
---
Tone down the security and standing losses for shooting ships. 
---
The security loss kinda' divides people into two groups that behave differently. High-sec capable and not. 
---
Being able to get around in HS is handy, so I've seen people prefer to keep it that way. But once you're not allowed (or rather your security gets low enough to block most travel) then there's no reason to keep what's remaining. 
---
And then you go full -10 and shoot every fucker.
---
No. But I am someone who's gone to a cyno vigil for someone ive known for years in this game.  The friendships and relationships are real.
---
Doesn’t matter if it’s not on Overview if they have a nade on every station.
---
&gt; F in ch
---
It took roughly 2.3 mil skill points for a baseline cyno guy to be upgraded. That's a month and a week or two of training. Who says you could have trained that much before the patch?
---
On the surface, it makes perfect sense to consolidate cynos into special ship classes and remove intel from null. But the result is just harder gameplay for one narrow slice of the population.
---
So now ratting in subcaps is harder for new players in Null. Null has actually become less valuable and null alliances are busy defending their remaining miners...
---
Sadly, you are right... It's really bad how they neglect those 2 bad guys T.T
---
haha
---
i never said any of that. but keep constructing strawmen so you don´t have to actually make sense. you lazy cunts are getting your shit kicked in one way or the other. it´s a pitty this didn´t happen back in 2012 after the first rise of megacoalitions. letting all you smoothbrains in was a mistake.
---
If you'll actually read the context around it, the farming simulator in the linked comment isn't actually being used to describe any person, it's illustrating how the playstyle being so catered to is one of a huge many others that haven't been getting any attention, much less any priority.

I kinda want to see a bunch of freighters bouncing off insta-dock bookmarks that are now inside the model.
---
lol who is CCP kidding. If the cyno vigil was the reason for this change they would have added a module called Cyno Vigil module that was fittable to a rookie ship and left everything else as was planned.
---
perhaps you should read the points are valid
---
3rd party tool can do as it pleases?
---
Eve also has the Vigilant ship hull, same word root.
---
Gratz you are one of the few to realize whats going on.
---
What we have rn is CCP listening for once in about a year and they promptly Listen to the wrong people.
---
The failures are home made and most changes werent introduced with the mindest of "what would our autistic players Do with it"
---
And now here we are.

Wormholes screeching adapt or die while they failed to adapt themselves for several years and CCP going to town with the sympthoms Not the reasons.

Who would have guessed that a big change during summer that makes game a lot harder to play would first make logins lower. The real question is that did it make the game better and more fun and make endless farming harder?
---
Its not impossible by any means, its just more tedious (more work for no added benefit). And if were gonna have a completely new mod there is no reason why it cant be on all ships. The intention behind the change was to make it harder for fighting caps, not logistical ships right?
---
So while I have probably not been around as long I have not heard that yet.
---
Again I was also being very unspecific for reasons but I do know people hold thousands of ships until demand is high to make a ton of isk... Think blackout supply vs demand on certain ships... Thousands of ships take very large amount of m3
---
Just back from Jita after buying 10 cov-ops for my cyno alt fleet. Not to mention that I've been skilling up 5 different alts since the first announcement. All wasted.
---
Fuck you ccp.
---
The entire playerbase consolidating into, eventually, one Bloc and bluing each other is in part a CCP failure but also a player failure. No matter what system is implemented they can't stop players from willingly not shooting each other ever. 
---
You can say "well making it risky causes this!" Which is kind of sidestepping the point that the game requires some risk and as long as the risk is &gt;0 players will consolidate into these massive safety circles.
---
He also talked about the possibility of industrial cynos in that same interview.
---
The main point I do actually agree with here is the changing gaming industry. Modern video game players barely have the attention span for BRs and TFT where I've seen people say matches are a little too lengthy. Those all take 30 mins or so. Are there new players to bring in? Sure. Are there swarms? No. This game is not for everyone, never was, and now it's for even fewer people.
---
Some say the wingy bits are for cooling. Others say it's because minmatar have so much junk they don't know what else to do with it then put it on their starships.

I want this put into the game
---
omfg. just create a cyno vigil item and does nothing but generate the visual... like fireworks displays. LOL typical of CCP to mess with actual game mechanics for a rarely used idea that is overrated anyway. 
---
Mindless idiots.

lol. So basically you are just happy to shit on someone else playstyle. True wanker. I hope you will enjoy fighting in corvettes.

But apparently you need them to save your rorqs.

No worries! That supercap umbrella is going away next month :DDDDDDDD

No they're not. They dropped from 2bil for 500 to 1.7ish, now they're up to 1.8 and on the climb again

&gt;You spelled "ping an intel channel for a response fleet to kill a single Exploration Frigate" wrong

No salt m8. Just pointing out that big blobs have it too easy. Then again, I don't expect a 2014 player with only 12b destroyed and rated 63% snuggly on Zkill AND a member of Goons to support such an argument.

The good side is that it simply won't ever happen unless players quit. There is more than enough rivalry between Panfam and Goons that they won't actually ever blue each other seriously (TTT stuff aside).

&gt;Like shooting 1 dude a week doesn't give any hit, but smartbombing 10 pods a day will knock you down.

Thats literally how it is now.  Shooting 1 dude a week kinda does hurt yor sec status but the hit is so small it is irrelevant anyways.

Hello everyone, I was reading up on the history of CODE because it's a pretty crazy thing and came across this old thread:  [https://forums-archive.eveonline.com/topic/352993/](https://forums-archive.eveonline.com/topic/352993/) Why was this thread really locked? What was CCP's stance against CODE at the start and end?
---
My Eve installation has become a cancer eating my free time (since 2007).
---
make it a Frigate using the venture as a base model with a diff skin and swap its ore hold for a fuel hold, and there you have an industrial frigate with the sole purpose of being a cyno ship for freighter.
---
I actually agree with almost everything in here, specifically that if you don't have 2 uninterrupted hours, don't even bother doing anything. Even if you're ping-warrioring, having content served to you on demand, it takes a SIGNIFICANT amount of time to play. The only realistic drop in/out style gameplay that you can do with regularity is soul crushing PVE or something like welping Frigates to feel elite in Lowsec.
---
I'd really take out "Eve is dying," I wrote this off as a whining bitching post right off the bat, when it actually is good.

#Its Summer
---
CCP Changed mechanics
---
CCP then gave free SP every day to fuck with success factor of blackout
---
Summer dip masked due to free SP
---
ED is garbage tbh
---
Carriers are the new battleship in comparing its capabilities.
---
omg this is terrible. I will be very sad.
---
Did they actually say that JF's could no longer take regular cynos? As far as I understood you could do one or the other.
---
You can employ other tactics (booshing etc) to clear subcap logi, that you cannot on a FAX though. To say the repping power is equal to 5 guards is ok, but they are not equal in other terms.
---
It's a mile wide and an inch deep, as they say.
---
A fucking bee making a common sense point...
---
Eve really is dying.
---
Its also a pain in the ass to seed.  Because industrials are large.
---
Do it up bud
---
Good eveningEecho.
---
The extra m3 industrials cost is a pain too.
---
Lol then you are  both retards. Botting has not decreased.. 
---
Bots just changed and the guy botting in my alliance just has bot scouts now. 
---
Also it had no effect of abyss botting..  which is slowly becoming the new meta..
---
&gt; This might just have to be a "dark before the dawn" situation for EVE. 
---
I think Eve has (from my standpoint at least) become more exciting. I know that for a lot of people here, the first guess is I am a habitual cloaky hunter. I actually can't remember the last time I ran that playstyle, though. I mine, explore, and rat  as much as I shoot players but every one of these things feels a tiny bit more dangerous.
---
Blackout has forced me to pay better attention, and I like it.
---
Oh shit, who left the wormhole machine unlocked?
---
Make me, darling. 
---
If you're going to chat shit, don't be a hypocrite.
---
Why, listen here wipper snapper just because a meme is old does not mean its bad. Back in my day... 
---
Now stop arguing with me and read the damn thing, then come back and try and sound less young while you articulate a proper measured and well thought out response.
---
I really doubt that.
---
When Eve becomes Simcity
---
Worst comes to worst, SP extraction in the future for isk.  One thing I don't mind about extractors.
---
If there system can flag a post from a CCP employee/Dev they need to fix/upgrade that system
---
You cannot come to that conclusion from eveoffline. CCP has masked this summer with free SP. After summer (Start of Sep) it will go up or remain spiral trend down..  one thing we know is pre summer it was going down and the true impact of changes have yet to be truly seen.
---
Livable Wormholes where
---
 a mistake
---
I too dislike anyone who doesn't embrace my playstyle and want them to leave the game.
---
I did read the damn thing. And I eve agree with a lot of it, as I posted in another comment. But leading with a shitty meme gets you treated like a shitty meme.
---
Just move some compressed ore and build a bunch of them at your mids.
---
If JohnDrees suggests something, it is wise to listen.
---
You can't take out salt and whining out of EVE. It's an integral part of EVE experience! ;)
---
Think it will survive 10 minutes sitting on an undock?
---
I don't.,.
---
Eve is legendary, but its playerbase is growing older and can't much longer commit to the things now required to maintain that status. So much agreed on this point. It needs an incredible evolution to keep pace with the changing times and audience, or it can just continue its gentle decline gracefully. Other space games are out or coming that help scratch the itch for way less time investment. Other games in general are replacing long MMO marches my friends used to engage in. That's even true for me until I stopped winning Eve again recently -- I originally quit simply due to how long it took to achieve anything meaningful, and how much it and IRL seemed to negatively impact each other.
---
this would be a good start for ccp to do something like this but olmeca is against it.
---
Good
---
&gt; so nope it doesnt defend those people from a shit ;)
---
&gt; your point is invalid .
---
It does. You just do not know how. ;)
---
add a reprocessing and manufatoring plant and the fuel to online it....
---
There's like 90 systems in a single c5 region, the characters needed to get sufficient coverage would be prohibitively expensive.
---
But that's how it's always been? And literally nobody complained. It shouldn't be easier for jfs to move around, I'm not saying it should specifically be harder but this change represents a barely noticeable difference in operations.
---
Lol. Someone's mad...
---
&gt; Teleporting into null from thera and dunking
---
I would be the first to agree with you that some danger must be introduced to cloaky ops. I've made suggestions about aggression cloak timers elsewhere.
---
But you're wrong. This is still HTFU. If you want to semi AFK, then you'll have to learn to die and not gripe. I was dropped a few days ago while mining. After the fight, I wondered how I could change the outcome, rather than bitch about how unfair it all was. I now have a plan for next time. It might work or it might not but I have exercised my agency regardless.
---
&gt;its deathknell is getting cheers from /r/eve.
---
Not really cheers. What I am saying is that when Eve dies (and it surely will one day) it should still be EVE and not some watered down shit show like what happened in Ultima (which oddly enough led to EVE being developed).
---
jfs are already t2 freighters
---
can remove a overdrive and put a aux or that one big pg mod for some nos your your tackle can't be neuted off. or some cheap pg implant should leave you enough room
---
Dead game
---
it's like your two remaining brain cells are trying frantically to put together a reply
---
Are Ore anomalies worth going into, in high sec space? I multi box - should I bring a combat ship with a mining ship?
---
Or use a station. Honestly, if you can't figure out how to get some T1 industrials at your mids then maybe JF isn't for you.
---
They can have nades on Citadels and gates too. Just warp from ping to ping, not a big deal. Citadels show up on Dscan, they’re not exactly secret locations.
---
upvote
---
No, the way it's always been is you threw a cyno on a noobship.  That the game created for you out of thin air after the last elite PVPer blew the last one up.
---
Now you have to supply ships, and they're somewhat big (in m3).  It's not anything disastrous, but it's a pain in the ass for no reason other than to be a pain in the ass.
---
just like ur mom
---
Festival Cyno.
---
Says the guy who lives in ultra-safe space rofl.
---
It will definitely effect the numbers. For every free SP I get, I log in all 6 of my alpha accounts that wouldn't normally get logged in, as well as any omega accounts that are just sitting and training up that I don't normally log in every day. Anecdotally, it has increased my contribution to the "active player count" by over 100%.
---
And no sov mechanics or sb bombs. Sec status loss has outlived its usefulness. There are enough mechanic differences between null and lowsec to finally let it go.
---
Make that place your home, and the galaxy shall be at your doorstep.
---
This is great and all, but you entirely miss that the fortnite and Co players literally are "flocking" to Eve. We have our pcu highs worth of new players trying the game literally every month. The issue is they don't stay.  
---
New player experience and retention is far and away the most important thing. We get a post or two every week here "is it too late to join?" - they see the fuck off nullblobs casually throwing around 3 and 4 digit numbers of "the endgame ships" and think to themselves that there's no way to catch up. The majority of people joining aren't interested in being a literal RTS unit in someone else's game. They want to create their own story, carve out their own empire. Be their own person.  
---
You want to keep new players? Give them a reason to play for themselves. The constant perpetuation of the blue donut and unassailable 1k man Titan fleets is the fucking antithesis of that, and THAT is why we have an issue retaining new players. Not random jokes about the UI or other shit. Everyone remembers instantly being hooked on interesting games that are good. It doesn't matter how new or polished your UI or graphics are if your gameplay is shit - just look at anthem.  
---
New players having a reason to play an interesting game and make their own story &gt; all the "reasons" you gave.
---
ok, here is a cookie, let me tell you back in my day **we had one meme** and we carried it up hill for 13 miles , thru snow, in the dark with only a small candle, there were wolves and not all of us made it.
---
 Those were the good times.
---
You have a pretty decent post, but I almost stopped reading during your introduction. Don’t start a decent post with a bad meme.
---
CCP has been pretty clear that they are willing to sacrifice the sort of players that will quit because of blackout and cyno changes. All of this concern about player counts is laughable in that context; CCP knows the metrics better than we do and is deliberately stirring things up to make the game more vibrant.
---
I'm cool with that.
---
yep.
---
They'll make that isk up in saved ozone in a month or two, no worries.
---
Lies. NC would never undock in the first place!

Olmeca campaigned to pvpers, and framed things personally. When not appealing to other PvP pilots, the posting is much more holistically scoped.
---
It be like that sometimes

Where is a new player supposed to go to pvp these days? Nullsec and they just become an f1 monkey. Highsec is ganking or war decs. So off they go to lowsec only to be punished for engaging in pvp in a pvp zone.
---
You will be the one who whines about seeding prices.
---
While I agree with many points in the post. I noticed something in the post and in many of the comments:
---
“If you don’t have 2+ hours, you can’t do anything other than rat or mine”
---
This is very much a nullsec (maybe wh?) mentality. I have always lived in lowsec and nowadays I have maybe 1 hour (sometimes less) to play on some weekdays and I’d be lucky to get 2 or 3 straight hours on the weekend, usually not. However, I pretty much always get satisfying content and a few good fights in FW lowsec even with this short timeframe. If only CCP breathed a little life into it it could be great but alas
---
Why does it need a cargo hold that big? Are you having a constant stream of Jump Freighters coming to it? 90% are going to be unrigged. 10% are going to be clown shoe or bait fitted. Most will get shot by a pre-aligned Tornado 100km away.
---
Thanks Mr. Boomer. What's it like to be able to afford property and have no student debt because your highschool education got you a job with a pension?
---
No point using regular cyno if the new type gets you same functionality for fraction of the cost
---
I don't know, I only heard that skillpoints are free if ccp gave them to u
---
 Its very clear that most people dont have the time to get involved into managing a group. If eve is in trouble, its because almost every corp i know cannot replace a director even if he is already half assing the job.
---
Its to the point that almost (20 out of 22) of the groups ive seen close, including very independent ones, have at some point joined a blob to remove management pressure off leadership. 
---
I also believe whs would get much more population not for more safety but for less logistics strain.
---
I just want to be able to get my miasmos full of ore through a high sec system without getting yanked because alphaing newbros is fun. The mw + cloak trick is my only saving grace
---
The problem is as old people retire out of the game their rivalry will die down. New players who crave safety and fall into the propaganda that the only good new player thing to do is join a mega alliance (slowly becoming CFC being the only one) and the blue donut expands further.
---
Here is the undock.  From the video it looks like there may be 3 exits when completed.   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qp6zJmA3oHk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qp6zJmA3oHk)
---
Don't listen to the RHP guy... They made more than enough mistakes themselves...
---
How about make some superficial 3rd type of cynos for vigils....kind of like the fireworks?
---
Pretty unlikely, given my retirement.
---
We cannot say if Eve is dying because the fuckbois at ccp masked the player counts with constant free SP..
---
Let's review this again after September 20th.. if the count is still down and continuing downward, the eve is dead.
---
heh.  Please do :D  We'll have some spooky snacks soon.
---
But the game never supplied a cyno or fuel? Alright you can inty those over but let's not forget that most of the stuff moved by jfs is along established supply lines so staging half a dozen t1 indys with fuel etc is really not hard. We're talking about ships that are capable of moving literally billions of isk in almost complete safety (if you're not a plonker). The idea that this should be even safer and easier is 8s just crazy, not to mention the fact that actually, requiring a t2 cyno is much much more skill intensive anyway and this way is actually easier to set up using a chain of alts.
---
Lastly, unless I'm being flair baited we're both part of blue donuts whereby every if either has dedicated alts or a chain of premade perms cynos sitting on keepstars. Nothing about this proposed change is bad.
---
&gt; social democracies on crack
---
The precise term is Fully Automated Luxury Gay Space Communism
---
I, for one, welcome the no noob ship cynos.
---
Which doesn't make sense, since blue loot is NPC orders that are static.
---
There needs something to be worth fighting for. Even it's just vanity, such as a gigantic monument at Jita 4-4 exit. People will be less willing to consolidate if the resources are finite.
---
Apart from that, owning vast space should be more profitable. Dynamic security is a good idea for this. 
---
It's unlikely that we can break up big blobs without hurting the small guys too, but we can make the big blobs fighting each other.
---
how about you gtfo of reddit ?
---
Faction Warfare is supposed to be the drop-in/out gameplay, but it's fucking broken at the moment. It'd be great if they could fix that, I think it's an area that could actually bring in a lot of people.
---
i don't live in 'merica thus i don't know komrade.
---
I personally run tier 5 abyssal deadspace filaments to make money. With that you get red loot BUT you also get items that are actually useful, mainly mutaplasmids and triglavian technology blueprints, but theres also sometimes the module itself (Mutadaptive Armor Repairers mainly) in there. I haven’t done any successful wormhole ratting but if you ONLY get blue loot thats kinda depressing. Atleast in abyssal deadspace you get stuff people want to use
---
Whereas you've made a reply without calling upon even a single brain cell.
---
Kudos
---
Overheating modules are recommended.
---
Okay, so lets say, 10% less ISK generated, but in return, we get bounty payments instantly injected to our wallets like you.  I'm fucking down with that.
---
Or, even better -- get rid of bounty payments completely.  All ISK is gained by selling to NPCs something like tags or "bounty markers" or some shit like that.  Then you dumbshits will have to haul all that shit to highsec and sell it.  I'll join CODE.
---
Nope. -10 highsec hankers use alts to circumvent the limitations imposed by lore.
---
That is a lot of text for tears.
---
you can just build the ships in the stations down the chain... easy
---
&gt; I'll join CODE.
---
welcome to my world
---
People won't fight, even if there's a reason, if they are just going to get steam rolled by 20:1 numbers, we see that in every area of Eve: people won't fight unwinnable battles.
---
There needs to be ways to encourage dissolution of big blocs such as CFC and NCPL. Without such a thing then the 1 in the 20:1 will get tired of being crushed under a sea of people and either join them (blue donut) or quit (ded gaem). 
---
The trouble is always what mechanics would encourage people to like actually strike out on their own, to fight each other, and to dissolve these massive super blocs. Of course, any such mechanics, whatever it may be, will get immediately screamed about by majority in those groups benefiting from it and fall flat.
---
just use EFT m8
---
Amazing how many of the ‘reeee’ posts are placed as that user’s first post as well.
---
&gt; But the game never supplied a cyno or fuel? 
---
Perhaps you could take a second to think about the relative sizes of the ozone for a cyno, a repackaged cyno module, and a T1 industrial.
---
You could even try counting, and noticing that this is now three items, instead of two.
---
Look, making JFs take cynos from recons/blops was nasty.  So CCP gave a carrot in the form of covert cynos.  Which they've now taken away, and uselessly limited the new cyno to industrial ships instead of just slapping an "any ship" label on it.
---
That doesn't mean this is fucking hell, it's a pain in the ass for no improvement.  In the service of an incredibly dumb change that kills large-scale cap battles so that eLiTe pVpErS can demonstrate their massive skills with ganks....er....skilled hunting.
---
That's cute, if "business as usual" is crying here like the last 10 years that people are docking up when your shitty nano gang is 15 jumps away, then sure.
---
ignoitton
---
Yeah. Nb4 people bitch about stations not having manufacturing, or having to research and buy bpos, or training the skills needed :-P
---
so light in an safe off dscan, and web warp yourself to your citadel/gate.
---
you're honestly typing like this is some kind of rocket science bud but its not.
---
Nah he doesn't understand.
---
He's just butthurt cause now he can't AFK farm rocks or rats.  Now he has to pay attention, have accounts himself, or friends with eyes that he pays to watch the gates (they like holes but... don't fucking pop up unannounced right as you siege...).
---
So now he is crying like a little child and wants to kick over everyone else's sandcastles.
---
28gb for me
---
A small group isn't killing 5 of my Rorqs in Esoteria....  Just like they won't kill your shit in Delve.  The game is a little too easy.
---
Thing is... You can't just have everyone move to lowsec. People feel loyalty to alliances and corps and they have friends there. Even if that happens, when nullsec become dead space it will need people to repopulate it, otherwise it will be dead.
---
Nullsec gameplay has to become more accessible and flexible too.
---
Automatically highlight the next system in your route in the overview. I'm sure this was added before I took a break but it's not working now.
---
I'm calling the police if this is a trick.
---
Pretty sure he's just being a smart ass
---
Oh yes please f*** over all tards who sit all day long at station to undock and bump you away with a carrier or similiar out of docking range  😎 Total broken crap mechanic and zero gameplay... Remove this and add theter to npc stations !!!
---
Only turnbo tards waste time dealing with stations at all when you can use a citadel.
---
Large coalitions are my preferred game-style, correct. I want to see more B-R/X47's. However, that requires more bodies in space, and particularly in null. And seeing how that type of play-style is what attracts media attention, player interest, larger number of subscriptions, and a general "fuck you" to the Fortnight and LoL games I fail to see your point?  
---
Is it the only play-style? No of course not and I enjoy the small gang as well and I very much enjoy the sig's and squads that The Imperium offers. But for CCP to shun capitals as much as they have, I think, takes away a part of the game that makes EVE.  
---
There can be balance where one type of play-style does not oppress the other, but I have little faith that CCP has the foresight, intelligence, and general competence to understand EVE mechanics.
---
Why so the citadel can still not have the cyno killer locked by the time they warp off.
---
Reminds me of the star wars new movies, and the "new" fans who drink from mugs with "fanboy tears" written on them.
---
It's record lows for sales for the franchise and getting worse, and the blame is everywhere.
---
Sometimes, giving the middle finger to people who love your product and telling them "k quit we dont need you" isnt the best business model..?
---
If you can't boosh the logi away from the dps, boosh the dps away from the logi.
---
I totally agree, one of the biggest points of stagnation is way too much safety, things just become grindy and overprotected to the point no one bothers. I do a lot of NPSI stuff myself, and it feels more fun because small gangs have an advantage and better chance to catch someone off guard by actually scouting, and maybe getting a response fleet that isn't a carrier/fax/dread hot drop
---
High sec simulator sounds a little dangerous for some of those nullbears.
---
also has bait potential tho
---
J-GAMP has a public cyno for everyone to use!
---
I mean i was talking about just normal cynos as i did every trip to jita using a citadel in the border system. I got tired of limited docking radius and bumpers so just never used tbe station when running logistics. The covert cyno would = almost no cynos lost at all but tbh the cost of cynos were almost non existant. Im glad they are adding the industrial cyno cus if i was still playing i would NOT want to have to waste almost 2 months per a cyno toon just to do jf cynos let alone standard cynos.as someone who ran alliance level logstics i already had to have a fuck ton of accounts but to be able to do a move route for stanrd caps? Jfc im glad i dont have to deal with that shit
---
We need it
---
I do. Empty though. Or with dual 90% webs to web it into warp.
---
that´s dumb
---
Take it up with CCP lmao
---
That CCP is being forced to add confusing tweaks and exceptions to make the cyno changes work is a clear sign that the idea was never properly thought out in the first place. The whole thing should be scrapped and started over with a clear goal and a plan to meet that goal, not some notion of "cHaOs".
---
Hunting expensive indus they dont shoot back ;D
---
 also i find a lot of stuff like this lol : https://zkillboard.com/kill/77242015/
---
2.7b pod in cyno ship. Never not shoot pod in low sorry!
---
passive shield regen sigils/nereus 
---
 extenders + rechargers and purger rigs and if you do it right you get hilarious amounts of hp/s
---
&gt; Large coalitions are my preferred game-style, correct.
---
Ok then you dont actually care about the health of the game, because they are stifling to the games ecosystems.
---
&gt;There can be balance where one type of play-style does not oppress the other
---
Factually incorrect.
---
Prestaged probes and cloakies in safe spots that are off Dscan range. Any industrial shows up on Dscan, hit “analyze” and warp. 
---
Unless you have a legacy deep safe which is unlikely.
---
I honestly expected higher level thinking from you. Maybe I’m just better at figuring out ways to make things die. Or maybe living under umbrellas has made you folks soft and lazy.
---
Nah
---
Not when you want a cyno to burn for half a day...
---
About half last all day until the ozone runs out.
---
The fitting is designed to run the cyno for a very long time.
---
Right... b/c the answer to Capital proliferation, is to introduce Mega Capitals. And then when everyone had thousands of those, we'll introduce Giga Capitals. Pretty soon we won't have solar systems anymore, it'll just be Stargates leading you from one Cosmic Capital ship to another.
---
Quite the word salad to say, "my plex matters more because I don't krab".
---
mmmk buddy.
---
So what your are saying is that there will be people in all the  JF systems close to Jita that cycle their probes every (what is the minimum cycle time?) 5-6s to then get a hit on you?  
---
And you jump into that because you are too lazy to hit dscan before lighting the cyno.  
---
Your scenario just doesn't make sense.
---
I know plenty.  Know why?  I live in a wormhole.  Most of us actual wormholers have low liquid assets, partly cause getting ships in is a damn chore, so we haul it in en-masse, which means we have more ISK tied up in PVP ships that we literally HAVE to fight for or lose everything because un-like Nullshits we get no asset safety.
---
And even then considering the risk and effort it takes to live in Jspace, we \*should\* have more rewards, because we have all of the risk.  At any moment we could have someone jump into our home, sedd in a shitload of battleships, and then we have to put everything on the line so our structures don't end up like pinatas.
---
That is the most aggressively Icelandic thing I've ever heard.
---
These are valid points. BUT, but... there is nothing like this shit. 
---
Like ye i play other games but they come and go where EVE just stays. Like nearly all of the games now a days are so dull, lack complexity and depth. 
---
Hats off to you dudes that have played 10 years and can just end it. Me after \~6 years of playing cant even think about stopping. 
---
Well maybe the PvE system is fucked since everyone in null never wanted to change it. At least that was the general opinion some 5 years a go when i last time lived in null. 
---
Maybe the idea is to kill most of the null off and then start reworking PvE since that way you don't accidentally cause extra harm to already rough economy.
---
Not that i really care tbh. More you guys get fucked in null means better value for my WH activities. This big whack to null was only a matter of time really.
---
My activity after drifters and before cyno changes was ok. Just cancel the cyno changes and I'll resub. I quit due to cyno changes. Blackout was annoying. Cyno changes were stupid.
---
And carriers are only a PVE/jewing thing sense when?? Do you even EVE bro?
---
This is a brilliant addition to my idea.
---
I need to add it to my next post
---
Last i checked olmecca wasn't in charge of game design at ccp.
---
EVE is dying and I keep om playing like a beast.
---
&gt;I mean, getting a black ops bomber volleyed off a station every time you went to Jita would suck pretty badly. 
---
then cyno at a safe?
---
Big blobs have always been a part of the game I struggle to think of a time where null isn't consolidated in two or three factions.
---
Neither will breaking up big blobs matter. There will always be winners and losers, and people always want to ally with the winners. It is human nature. Remember, alliances started from corps setting reputation to each other and coalitions started from alliances doing so. Even if you somehow managed to make all of the big blobs instantly disappear, ere long new blobs will emerge.
---
The biggest problem new players face is *lacking things to do*. I've introduced at least a dozen people into the game and they were all baffled after the tutorial ends. "What should I do?" I told them they can do PVP in lowsec and industry in highsec, or if they want to do null/WH they can join a corp. But they always don't feel confident or is afraid of the commitment. Before they can join a corp, null or not, they just lose interest or get killed in lowsec because they were driving their shiny battleships with all their stuff on it. Or they quit after hearing they need 2 months to pilot their favourite ship.
---
God, it's awful. I was incredibly lucky because I got into stealing stuff in static 1/10 or 2/10 DED, and that kept me going before I joined a corp. This game needs more soloable and beginner-friendly content, broken FW notwithstanding, better catch up mechanisms, and a really streamlined way to connect corps with players.
---
You only get blue loot unless you salvage, and salvaging isn't worth nearly as much for the time investment usually. Certainly feels gimmicky.
---
RIP
---
I mean, I am in Horde and it feels like new players joining are equally getting on board with "goons are bad grrr" (which is tbh what we need to keep good rivalry going).
---
If you care about things like, retention, and revenue; lower Daily Active Users is never better than higher.
---
If you care about completely subjective things like “fun”, who could every really fucking answer that?
---
This. This is exactly whats going on. 
---
Enjoy your week free of reddit ads. I'm spending the real life money i usually pay to CCP on reddit gold instead to give to people who actually understand how babdly CCP is fucking things up and how many high paying customers they are driving away. Well done, Hilmar. The only good thing you have done for EVE in the last decade was PI revisions, and that took you that entire decade. Rise, these cyno changes are what finally made me quit wholesale. You have killed all logistics.
---
dust 514' sequel. Dust 515 - ship to ship
---
Lowsec sucks, don't move there, it's bad stay away
---
For me the AT got a lot less interesting when I couldn't gamble on it
---
&gt; Prestaged probes and cloakies
---
Lol what, ok so we're talking about the COVERT CYNO which is lit by a ship that cloaks, meaning until you decloak and light it you're not on dscan, AND, if you see probes and you still light your cyno you're a fucking idiot.
---
You're mixing two different conversations up and then have the balls to call somebody dumb, you fucking idiot.
---
I agree completely. Eve is my type of game so even though I know I’m 10 yrs from even owning a titan, it’s fine with me. But the few space need friends that I have get discouraged when I explain to them that basically the player base will tell you to get fucked in your t1 ship that you’re just trying to go ratting in. I invested RL money (too much) into PLEX to inject 3 toons up to being lower mid tier Indy toons. Now I can basically afford to have ONE toon that does PvE and PvP shit and not be terrified of losing my next ship.
---
Then you know jack shit about jspace. Walk a mile before you drop this puke all over the place.
---
That titan is under a super umbrella, has plenty of ways to survive.  Also has the benefit of being able to sleep at the wheel and STILL make 150+m ISK/hr for 24 fucking hours a day if wanted.
---
The nestor pilot has to manage targets and reps, as well as watch dscan like a hawk, watch the probe window for new sigs, manage the nestor and be prepped to GTFO from rats that can scram from 150km in some cases.
---
In this time, the nestor hasn't made shit.  ONLY when the blueloot is sold (successfully I may add) does the nestor make ISK. Until then it's just a loot pinata.
---
Risk vs reward.
---
Don't trust anything CCP say that isn't a patch note lol. Especially when the forum post starts with "This September we are **planning** large changes for Cynosural Fields"  
---
They are still planning.
---
for ~elite pvpers~ yeah I agree
---
My Pulitzer laughs at you.
---
2/10
---
but, but, but we only meant to ruin your game!!
---
Only one person crying here :)
---
CCP doesn't "cave in" - they deliver something kinda along the lines of what players want but in a fucked way so it sucks.
---
How many real wars were there where the big guys fought each other with everything that they had?
---
Goons/Russians vs Bob
---
Halloween War
---
WWB
---
And the war last summer 
---
If you can find a way to correlate those wars with the availability of resources I will be extremely surprised
---
&gt; the game must be less time-consuming and more accessible to survive, contrary to what recent changes do to the game, and EVE must race against the clock to ensure its survival.
---
I generally agree with this, which is weird because I almost never agree with Eve-Is-Dying arguments, but this is actually a very important point here. 
---
However, I think the rorq nerfs/cyno changes do have a chance to help, as part of a broader push away from supercap blobs being the only relevant strategic doctrine. This would help people play the game on a less severe time budget, since you wouldn't be obliged to krab for titans in order to matter to the alliance. 
---
CCP needs to make good on that potential with a final nerf to titans and supercarriers, probably something like "immune to fax reps" - even with scaling reps they're too good. 
---
A PvE overhaul is also probably necessary to make the grind more exciting/less aids. For the same reason not a lot of today's youngsters are super hyped to tell all their friends they finally got 99 Firemaking, not a lot of new players are gonna myrm rat for 50 hours a week (or indeed, any hours a week) to pay for shit. Abyssals were a good effort, but CCP really needs to double down on making PvE fun and engaging, which has imo been this game's single biggest weakness since it launched.
---
Why the fuck would you use SP to get these skills before the change hit the server???
---
Null PVE is broken. It's repetitive, unchallenging, and heavily skewed towards someone that owns a super. 
---
If they want to redo the PVE, they could have done it without removing null players. They can always set the rewards on the conservative side and hotfix it if it is broken. If anything, removing null players will break the economy even more, because you are literally taking the majority of your manufacturing, mining and money printing away. Not to mention it's a hella shitty way to treat your veteran players; what if CCP wants to change WH and remove all of you next? It's a dangerous way of thinking.
---
when I was a boy, we walked 100 miles thru desert, just to get to school!!!
---
(well in wastelands anyway)
---
LOLOLOL
---
Agreed. The best way to keep things from going stagnant is to be constantly mixing things up.
---
What can they be doing TODAY, to make their game more interesting?
---
You cannot light a cyno in Hisec.
---
You have to cyno into a lowsec system bordering Hisec, and gate the rest of the way to Jita.
---
If you're smart enough to get a safe out of DScan range of anything of interest in your lowsec system, the only way you'd lose a cyno is if someone is sitting there actively running combat probes. Even then, you could still possibly :frogout: since the cyno lasts only a minute.
---
imagine typing this many words for another irrelevant "eve is ded" badpost
---
dude. I know. by Jita entry systems I mean the 3 or so systems people actually use as last cynos when going to jita.
---
See: Eve-Online. Probably best in 2009.
---
He's against any large targets that are smarter than he is.
---
imagine getting flairbaited by joecuster
---
It actually had a hell of a lot more to do with the reliability of rolling holes.
---
If you lose a roller, that is a warm body that could be in the fight for the next static we scan.  Without some modicum of reliability in rolling the holes we just end up with no-body being in the home hole so we can't fight.  And no-one else can then, either.
---
So then you end up with J space being dead as fuck, everybody has to either sit in the hole they live in and the ISK per day is so shit you can't afford to keep station fueled or buy ships, then we all move back to nullsec and quit in 5 minutes because all of kspace can go fuck itself it's so boring.
---
That'd be a quick and sure-fire way to lose a few hundred thousand dollars a month.
---
100%
---
Why do you think its more likely that the changes were half ass because they didn’t listen; rather than the implementation being limited by technical complexity that forced a shity compromise of the original goal?
---
Jumping JFs into cyno-jammed systems would be more than a wonky meme.
---
stop don’t do this to yourself
---
Clownshoe nereus cynos here we come
---
Elite Dangerous is a few years too late implementing interesting content
---
Eve was never hard, just tedious.  Tedious is fine if there is a reward at the end, but there just isn't anymore.  Empire building is dead.  The great wars are gone forever.
---
It makes perfect sense, you’re just dumb and don’t know how probes work. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
&gt; and my hole home closed before I got back to it.
---
its not like you didnt have a way out, infact you had 70 of em
---
the idea that cyno vigils are even worth discussing when talking about mechanics changes, let alone being "the most important issue" is fucking scary
---
Im with you.
---
You can just move ore and buy BPCs, you need precisely 0 indy skills to build a T1 hauler lol, and ore/bpcs fit in cloaky things, some of which may be nullified
---
it has a function other than being reddit karma bait
---
The point that you’re missing is that whatever lights the cyno would be on Dscan if it’s in range. My argument stands regardless, sorry tiger.
---
I also find it strange that you think the probes would be on Dscan - do you not know what “prestaged probes” means???
---
Derp. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
now ask yourself, would it have been any different if it was just a vigil?
---
Can confirm, and the locals will gladly greet you.  User satisfaction mileage may vary.
---
It is worth playing. I recommend finding a mega corporation, that you always have pilots to team up with. A mega corp has more than 100 members. You might change your mind.
---
T3 freighter?
---
Ignoitton, Tama, Aurohunen, Aunenen, Carrou, Maila... Depends on where you are coming from
---
Ami and Kamela are Popular for Amarr.
---
Last I'd heard earlier this year it wasn't. Tamber had been working on it before he quit and refunded the Kickstarter for it. He's still pretty active on the EVE Creative discord though.
---
Wait are you insinuating probes aren't on dscan?
---
&gt;My argument stands regardless, sorry tiger.
---
Quite literally only in your head since you can't even properly follow a conversation.
---
EHHHH, dont they cave though?  Not always, and not even when they should, but they DO cave in sometimes.
---
Other times they ignore us for 3 years at a shot.
---
Because my cyno alts don't waste sp on shit they don't need.
---
Because the spice must flow
---
Because without injecting and additional weeks of training I won't be able to run my routes so I planned ahead.
---
Good post, and it outlines some of the important aspects that are forgotten about in the current discussions on this sub.  
---
I do have an issue though with calling rorqs and capital proliferation a symptom. It is inconsistent with the following paragraph, in which you outline the devaluation of assets as one of the main conflict inhibitors.   
---
Injectors are at the core of that issue, but they won't get removed from the game so we need to tackle the next link in the chain. And that is rorquals, as they have sped up ressource generation &amp; devaluation at an unprecedented scale.
---
Only way to get me out of WH space is to 100% just delete WH space. Like they can nerf blueloot and i dont really care, i just look out if there is better money to be made by other activities. If they make holes more random to roll we just use cheaper rollers no biggie.
---
FC what is dscan?
---
.... that’s how prestaging probes works you ignorant mong.
---
Do you need me to draw you a picture when I get home? I’ll make it really colorfulz
---
Is Eve worth playing?  Yes.
---
Can Eve be time consuming?  Absolutely.   
---
Can Eve be played casually?   Most definitely.   One of the great things about Eve is that you continue to train skills without actually being logged in.   You can add skills to your training queue and they continue to train even when you're not playing.  For casual play this is great 'cause if you don't have a lot of time, you'll still make forward progress so long as you have a skill queued.  
---
There are tonnes of things to do solo that generally aren't super grindy/time sensitive, and if you find a good corporation (Eve's version of guilds/clans) with people who have the same attitude or mindset then you're set. 
---
Wealth acquisition can be time consuming and as grindy as you want, but I would suggest focusing on learning the game and finding aspects you enjoy and then let the wealth come after.  
---
Shoot me a PM or ask here if you have any questions.
---
In some of those wars fighting over moons played a substanital role. I agree that currently there are not enough ressources that are also conflict drivers.  
---
But this could easily be remedied by making the ressource system more dynamic, and more importantly limit the amount of available ressources.
---
The economy is fine.
---
&gt; Obliged to krab for Titans
---
I don't understand where this sentiment comes from, as I think most people want Titans simply because they are the biggest ship in the game. People will still krab or mine just to see their ISK increasing, and if they are not krabbing and mining and not PvPing due to time constraints --- they aren't doing jackshit and they won't log in at all. 
---
It's null PVP that is the problem. If roaming fleets aren't taking 1hr to assemble, 1hr to fly to hostile space and 1hr to get back, far more people will opt into killing shit more often. Which is why null to null wormholes are so sought after because they almost always bring content, quickly.
---
The cyno/rorq change problem are twofold: Rorq changes and null nerfs, while *theoretically* benefitting people with other playstyle, the other playstyles aren't really alternatives to what people do in null. People in null blocs have relatively flexible playing times and are able to do things (albeit just boring ratting) without two uninterrupted hours. As I said, it's just trying to treat the symptoms. Had Rorq nerfs and cyno nerfs combined with a PVE rework and changes that make finding fights easier, it will be justifiable. Right now CCP is just putting us into putting more effort into Rorq mining and carrier ratting, without offering alternatives. FW is broken, WH is for ppl with lots of time, and lowsec welping is not for everyone.
---
A product manager who is closely monitoring DAU or MAU activity and trying to grow that KPI doesn’t at all sound like someone chasing/gaming a bonus.
---
Its like one of the most obvious metrics besides Revenue that shows the health of a game. I would fucking fire any PM who doesn’t know its own DAU or MAU (fuck MAU, if youre not looking at Daily Active Users you are failing) Furthermore, if they don’t have a particularly compelling reason why theyre NOT trying to grow its DAU (or right a knowable plateau/erosion, like in this case with blackout) I would also fire them.
---
This test, bolstered by targeted login incentives, is all about checking to see DAU activity, and whether or not they think in the long run it will be better.
---
Word, thought I saw it through 8/26.  Thanks
---
How do probes work?
---
They did talk about limiting hole rolling or something. I lived in WH before for a short time and it would be absolutely cancerous if you can't roll holes easily anymore. I don't know why, but I think they should have did the opposite by increasing hole spawn rate if they want more content in WH space.
---
Well, if you are still incentivized to AT THE LEAST log in every day, you are still engaged enough not to lapse/cancel your subscription.
---
If you cant even be bothered enough to login in for free skills, you’re a one piss away from churning back to something else.
---
This. The cyno changes were the nail in the coffin for my EVE career. I played for 11 years, at one time had almost 40 active subscriptions I paid with a credit card, and have spend nearly as much real life money on buying PLEX. All told, I've sunk more than $40,000 into CCPs pockets over the years. I'm an adult with a couple college degrees, a full time, well paying job, a wife, pets, and a couple of houses. I don't have time to distribute 30 some industrial ships or covert ships across my cyno network - which i ran for free for friends and alliance mates, as well as my own logistical efforts. CCP is just making the game work with ham handed, panic changes. I used EVE as an escape from my real life and real work. Now it's nothing to get excited for. 
---
Thank you for being a voice of reason, and enjoy the platinum as well as a month free of ads on reddit. Hopefully CCP will see the error of alienating their aging and loyal player base. 
---
I'm spending the money I have set aside for EVE on reddit gold, and now platinum, as a show of protest. Thanks again for articulating this so well.
---
You're right.  If we stack enough sloppy changes and gimmicks on top of each other, perfect game balance will be achieved.
---
Don't listen to the complaining on Reddit. It's still worthwhile.
---
Thank you for your clarification, i'll certainly ask if i have any problems
---
&gt;That CCP is being forced to add confusing tweaks and exceptions to make the [insert topic here] changes work is a clear sign that the idea was never properly thought out in the first place.
---
how long you've been playing this game again? that's like every change they've done for a while, from sov to structures to panic and the lost goes on. To be fair at least now they're making changes at all
---
Join us for the Festival of Cynosural Fields this September, starting with a log in rewards of 2 million sp total.
---
LOL
---
There's way too many CSM candidates that start with "I'm running to represent my coalition" that right there is a red flag and a half.
---
TIL you need to do math for ORM.  Maybe it's because I'm a former crayon eater, but our ORM checklists in the Marines never included math.
---
Fucking Eve players ruined Eve
---
so much barf
---
He should show his daughter planetary interaction and have her become his personal PI monkey so he can make the isk.
---
Ok, granted most people here are malcontents, but you do see the problem with those two scenarios right?
---
EVE needs that middle ground of iterative balancing over time as much as ever.
---
If only there were an ingame map that would light up when people use a cyno....
---
Confirming probes show up on Dscan at infinite range. I’m an /r/EVE user and what I lack in intelligence, I make up for in thinking in recycled memes.
---
DOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMM
---
and gloom
---
good luck probing down a stealthbomber with probes out of dscan range lmao
---
You can move them around in space! GASP
---
Who?
---
Look at Mr moneybags over here, bragging about his dozens of ISK...
---
Down with the 1%! Burn Jita!
---
That’s why you prestage them.
---
Am I being trolled? Y’all can’t actually be this stupid.
---
What ever they do it just makes things fresh and tactics need to be re-:thonked: which is always fun.
---
I like doing the same thing, but with sigils.  Works great on a structure, too.  Dumb dumbs think they have an easy industrial kill...
---
then they ded.
---
This, and the fact that all the tethers in the galaxy can't save a carebear.
---
It is but eve is a game of small goals lined up after another and big goals as waypoint. Also you can play for free and see if you like the game, also change your overview asap with a community one z-s etc.
---
I never got my login token ;-;
---
Last time I mentioned things like age, life commitments, and the time sink being an issue for people eventually I was told no. There was no way people might not always have 5 hour blocks to do basic actions. 
---
How are they doing on teaching and learnability in general for that wave of new players that never seem to stay around?
---
I agree with every point.
---
noice
---
i knew olmeca fears shuttles.
---
You sure about that? You really think we will not be able to drop that hammer because of some shitty Cyno changes? Bro, we're goons. The Umbrella isn't going anywhere.
---
I think you're onto something here, Hilmar listen to this man he is going places!
---
Blackout killed my enthusiasm to play because it made it harder for me to at least make a decent amount of ISK in my limited free time due to the fact that it made subcap ratting riskier. I'm actually all for the cyno changes and the changes CCP were making for logi with diminishing returns. Hell, I'd love for there to be more Drifter attacks that mean you can't just rat for hours in peace but instead have to fleet up to defend your space if it isn't being used. Blackout just seemed like a shot in the dark that has some consequences that I personally don't see any benefit from given the positives and the negatives the removal of auto local population has. The lack of players now in space and at least passively engaging in the game socially due to these changes are also something I'm kinda worried about.
---
I totally get that sometimes changes mean that the game isn't for me anymore, but I guess the drop in player count and ratting means a lot of other people feel that way too. Which sucks, because I really like EVE. I just don't like that some of the changes they made have an impact on people like me and newer players who don't powergame and just want to shoot space submarines.
---
I'll still be checking in on the game and trying to figure out alternatives to subcap ratting that mean I don't have to be 100% paying attention to the game, but for now I and probably a decent number of other players have just checked out.
---
it was kinda usefull before the changes, cause there where a lot of different ship types who could jump.. with only JF abble to, i doubt it.
---
I use cyno sigils, but your fit is kinda sub-optimal.  Nereus has grid for two LSE, and if you replace some ECH with SPRs, you can really get a solid passive tank on it.
---
I enjoy using cyno sigils on citadels, since dumb dumbs warp in thinking they have an easy kill... then they ded.
---
tbf i would like all 10 wormholers to leave the game and this reddit mostly
---
&gt;Cant wait for them to allow neutral logi to rep mercenaries again.
---
While Rorquals are a problem and need to be nerfed, let's remember coalitions never lose because their warchest is empty, at least since the last decade. I've never seen individual members actually go broke either. Even during Fraternity's rise, where their warchest allegedly went empty a few times, they were able to cover SRP through donations and plexing --- the latter's price directly related to inflation (which is normal to have).
---
The Thing is: outside of the first few wars in EVE, coalitions never *needed* to fight for land to survive. Valuable moons were once sought after, but then the production outweighed consumption and gradually their value decreased too. Citadels only made this worse by making "urbanisation" possible. Injectors are also a catalyst that had accelerated the overabundance, but let's face it, even if it doesn't exist it's just gonna take dedicated people more time to make Rorq ALTs. 
---
I would say overabundance is an inevitability in this game with the consumption tied to destruction. If you nerf Rorqs to the ground and nerf bounties --- so what? It's only delaying the inevitable. Either the game needs to be designed around post-scarcity economy, or that CCP needs to crank up other ways to absorb excess minerals.
---
this is a real thing that happened . I was in my rorqual the other day and i had logged out. EU tz begins . My friends start mining and i log in after an hr . As i log in my friend says Hard knocks sabre in system and i click log in . I also realize at this point that i am in the moon belt and not safed up cause i was dumb and cocky . I land on grid HK sabre also lands on refinery and then warps to me and bubble me ... i am not in siege tho cause i just warped in . So i try to get out of bubbles with all my drones on the sabre . Sadly i was not able to get out and i also had moved away from my mobile depot . Soon after a lachesis lands on grid and points me and the lachesis also has damps ... i still try to move out as i was mwd fit . After the good 10 mins the main fleet lands on grid . Now here is the best part " my friends had cleaned the moon belt of asteroids near me for 100km ..and with me being damped i am not able to lock anything beyond 80km .i am not able to panic . I really thought wow i am stupid and ccp devs are even more stupid . I entered siege to panic was still in siege (30 secs to go) when panic ended and i died . It was my first time being tackled in a rorqual so i learned quite a few things ..but please don't tell me that locking asteroids was the best solution there .
---
prestage them somewhere in a safe you don't know? sure thing brav lol
---
Is it worth it?
---
Yes,
---
If you’re strong enough.
---
Going to be so much fun popping your expensive cynos before popping your rorqs.  
---
Please feed me more isk
---
All right i will cut to the chase. How much combat probing have you actually done in your eve life? Because it doesn't sound like you understand the involved mechanics all that well.  
---
If you were to catch a JF in one of those  systems you first need the intel which character in local is the cyno char.  
---
Otherwise you will have to refresh/verify your combats every 5 seconds to have any idea that anyone has uncloaked their covop to light the cyno. Which would be ludicrous.  
---
Next you need to get a decent hit on that cyno/the JF coming in. Depending on system radius that will be more or less likely. In most cases you will probably need 2 cycles to get the JF (assuming perfect skills + virtues here) which is a 10 second window for the JF to get webbed into warp.  
---
So the only way you will get a catch in this situation is if you get a 100% hit on the  JF right as it is loading system. Which outside of super small systems will require you approximate knowledge of the safespot that is being used. Good luck on hitting that timing. And even then it will be super close.  
---
So yea, now it is your turn to explain why i am dumb and how moving probes around space will help.
---
Excuse you that is *our* term.
---
Jita 4-4
---
Plex
---
Even younger players these days seem to prefer shorter, but more frequent sessions. When gaming is no longer regarded as the nerds' activity, the average gamer will of course become less hardcore, which is why the gaming industry is changing.
---
Should be a cyno rig that takes up 350 calibration but allow cyno on that ship.
---
Over on the programming subs they have programmingcirclejerk. Maybe we need evecirclejerk?
---
bro what in the actual fuck are you talking about, if you pre stage probes, they're in space, if you see probes in space, you dont light your cyno....why are you being this insanely dumb about a covert cyno?
---
It would be cool if you gradually lost janitors, scientists, etc. as you flew with a damaged ship.
---
Cool story bro.
---
I mean it's cool to not know about something. But you are just being a duck because you don't like that thing and thus behave as if it should not exist.
---
Sounds like you need a dose of frigate FW PvP in your life.
---
i think ccp will hit wormholes like they hit nullsec, don't think it will be good for the game like all the rest of the recent changes without a real investment into the game like content, stuff for the playerbase, catchup mechanics for new players (not skill injectors) etc.
---
i think they either reduce the rage rolling which can be done, or remove mass limits completly and let you stuck per day in your connection. If they would invest they would bring a wormhole generator but we all know ccp always hint and never deliver.
---
&gt;Actually, it does make it uncivil because you call these people 'Farmville Online' players which to them insults their playstyle
---
imagine being this insecure
---
The whole concept of sandbox gaming is fucked when it's humans playing it.
---
I blame the goon mentality as much as I blame CCPs   game design.. people dont WANT to really fight each other.
---
You don’t have to know their safe. You only need to approximate an area of a certain size wherein it *could* be, based on what (limited) areas outside of Dscan range (from the nearest celestial) can be traversed and bookmarked.
---
If you have a 10 AU stretch of “dark space”, then you only need to stage 3 dudes along that path, with  Dscan set to 2AU and 1AU probes prestaged on themselves. It’s trivial to set up bookmarks 2AU apart and with practice you can become quite accurate. A little overlap is fine, and small gaps are not a huge deal.
---
I used this sort of tactic extensively during HiSec war secs and griefing mission runners. I caught a lot of people. You don’t know everything about this game, so check your ego and sit down.
---
&gt;This one is more or less an afterthought, but I've seen a lot of /r/eve people seem to think the game will just do fine after getting rid of 50% of player base, because they are "carebears that don't contribute anything to the game". When pressed about how EVE is going to recover, they say "a massive influx of new players" will rectify it.
---
&gt;It's not happening. 
---
Preach the good gospel my dude.
---
Nice write up of my main concern with the course CCP is taking with the planned changes - increased grind, commitment and time needed to play the game. If the existing player base which is already used to that is going to bail (and this is what CCP is aiming for) where in the world would you find new players that would be willing to invest even more of their time to this game? Not to mention starting from scratch.
---
Okay Grathy, I’ll draw you a nice bright picture when I get home. 😁
---
TLDR
---
Yea, please, cause im trying not to go down the road of name calling yet and you're making it really hard here for me by not making much sense, maybe the picture will help.
---
Eve's #1 problem isn't the smaller population resulting from whatever. It's that the game world is too big for a smaller population to thrive in. We have 3x as much space as we should have for the number of players, which reduces conflict which bores PVPers and screws with the economy and forces devs to 'nerf' pve and sends the game into a downward spiral.
---
Age of chaos should be NPCs nuking 1/2 of the game's stargates/solar systems so that the players who are left are jostling for what remains.
---
You!?  You were lucky to have a school in the wastelands!
---
We had to walk twice that way.  Through snows.  Uphill.  Both ways.  And we were thankful for it!!
---
Yeah well, I have the p20 pro...
---
Unless they are drilling down into a specific version of the p20 pro, I gotta say, this is not a good sign.
---
And I say this as someone that likes the game and isn’t a hater.  The ones that want you call me a hater because they don’t want to admit that they need you to feel like they didn’t waste their money and time
---
If eve does their version of WoW Classic, jump on it the very first chance you get.
---
you're talking mighty big for someone who doesn't know what deep safes are lmao
---
&gt; Is it worth to play the game under a casual perspective?
---
That's how I do it really. I just undock and go shoot things in lowsec. I am really bad at the game but it's fun anyway.
---
&gt;now it is your turn to explain why i am dumb and how moving probes around space will help
---
Sure.
---
1. You never mentioned the hunters using Dscan 
---
2. You don’t hit “analyze” until a positive Dscan result.
---
3. Moving probes keeps them off Dscan until the moment you’re ready to analyze.
---
4. Wtf is this nonsense about “cycling probes”? Kid your brain went sideways there.
---
I'm still working through that answer.  The most difficult part I have of making the decision that Eve is a game worth playing is that I don't know of any game where you pay over $130.00 U.S. per year to play (the alpha restrictions are so huge to me that the free to play is not an option).  Now if either free to play was less restrictive in terms of skill points, training time, and what you can fly, do then absolutely yes worth playing.   If Omega time was more reasonable especially in terms of yearly (i.e. yearly cost was $60 for Omega time), then definitely worth it.
---
Agree 100%, its worthwhile, get the hell off reddit like NOW don't read anything else, you will just be put off by all the toxic bullshit, in fact if you play I suggest you avoid reddit for at least your first 2 or 3 months, if your still here by then, then your probably safe to come to reddit cos youll know enough to filter out all the trash.
---
Mentioned deep safes in another comment. See how easy it is to be ignorant and wrong?
---
Here you go bud: 💺
---
But I can’t afford to replace that many t2 frigates! Lol! I’m a po boy
---
Yup. Just don't let yourself get sucked into a gameplay style that requires you to put in a lot of time if you aren't having fun. (i.e. trying to myrmidon mine for a ratting carrier for a rorqual for a ratting super for more rorquals for a titan so you can die on a gate because you've never actually pvp'd in your 2 years in game)
---
In a lot of cases you'll face a choice between profit/progression and actual fun stuff. Choose fun every time - you'll end up making more progress in the [places that matter.](http://zkillboard.com) 
---
Join a corp that can fast-track you into PvP (including free ships; newbie-grade ships are *really cheap* and an experienced player can earn enough in 1 day to buy 10,000 of them, so don't worry about exploiting handouts.) Fight a lot, have fun and git gud, and worry about the boring stuff never.
---
Err, in WWB didn't goons just feed CO2 and flee to lowsec?
---
Yeah, after I spent all of my stashed free SP training into covert cynos
---
Wait so if i don't upgrade to omega then i can't fly some ships? Any examples?
---
And make sure that you first join a corp that doesn't produce constant Reddit propaganda. If you've been enjoying the game in one of those, you can probably enjoy a big coalition too.
---
Here to point out in exactly 32.5 years old.
---
Eve is slowly loosing pilots.
---
I swear i saw a petition against Hillmar, here [https://www.change.org/p/pearl-abyss-fire-hilmar-veigar-p%C3%A9tursson-aka-ccp-hilmar-without-any-golden-parachutes](https://www.change.org/p/pearl-abyss-fire-hilmar-veigar-p%C3%A9tursson-aka-ccp-hilmar-without-any-golden-parachutes)  35 signatures, but I think we just want PA to become a little interested in Hillmar work.
---
you also mentioned industrials showing up on dscan which implies nothing else than that you are majorly confused.
---
Oh yea for sure, just nerfing rorquals won't fix the economy.  
---
But for now it would atleast slow down the economic collapse if they were to apply the nerfbat to rorqs and how many minerals they can flood into the market.  
---
Then revamp the entire way that ressources are generated, make them more scarce/limited. Find ways to curb multiboxing so that just scaling up your number of accounts is worse thanoptimizing/innovating ways to increase the income.  
---
This would obviously be a lot of work. And while i have not given up hope by a long shot i am worried that ccp has run out of steam to push through with these kind of drastic changes.   
---
I guess we will see with the age of chaoshow willing they are to push through big, controversial changes.
---
Structures suffer damage based on wh rating, damage is cumulative unless repped, 4 days for astra to explode if left unchecked, low power doubles the damage rate.
---
Are you behind 7 proxies?
---
Delete half or two-thirds of new eden, imo.
---
We had less space when we had more players... but now people wonder why there's no PvP to be found and PvE needa needs because "omg infinite resources."
---
That is what i was looking foward to. I wanted to try EVE for the PvP battles, as i love fights betweens spaceships. I'll take that into consideration
---
For the reason, look in this thread. Everyone is talking about low or null. I can't even blame them, that's where they spend their last few years. But new players won't go to low or null. Yeah sure you have your drunk slav in a while who goes to low and actually likes it but most of the people want to do carebear shit while getting accustomed to the game.
---
And that stuff is just not up to nowdays standards, aside from the dozens of content-starved bittervets who roam high preying on noobs with their alts while waiting for the CTA that never comes.
---
That 'log on and get straight into the action' should be what faction warfare is for, but having not updated it whilst implementing stuff like citadels that makes much of the mechanics obselete has killed that off too.  
---
CCP, update faction warfare to bring the quick fights back to EVE!
---
&gt;	Because my cyno alts don't waste sp on shit they don't need.
---
Well it looks like you fucked up that part anyway lol
---
We are putting the effort and organization to be as effective as we can defending our sov. That isn't stifling the ecosystem, it's growing it. Those not putting the same effort are simply lazy and would rather have goods handed to them on a silver platter, which is exactly what was happening before moon mining changes. Work for you sov, risk assets, and earn it. Reddit is seeing the tip of the iceberg of our success, then proceeded to bitch and complain that "It's not fair that goonies are making so much iskies from their toonies" yet they lack the coordination, organization, balls to actually risk assets on the field, and leadership to maintain the tempo.  
---
And on the topic of cap balance, your wrong. Let's start simple.  
---
* Carriers are effective against battleships to cruiser hulls.
---
* Dreads are effective against carriers and supers.
---
* Supers are effective against dreads and supers.
---
* Remove all HAW weapons (or at least on Titans).
---
* Subs are not effective against supers and vise versa.
---
As in, t1 hulls with a mix of meta and t2 modules?
---
If that's the difference between you hanging out in LS so I have a small chance at more fights and not, what's your ingame name? Lol. I'll send you isk.
---
&gt; Wormholes screeching adapt or die while they failed to adapt themselves for several years
---
How exactly did wormholers fail to adapt?
---
TFW you are morally compelled to upvote a goon's goodpost &gt;:[
---
I am definitely not elite.  I gave up hot pockets years back.
---
You think you do, but you don't
---
I think a lot of people are likely misinterpreting CCP's comments on hole rolling. We don't know exactly what they mean or plan to do. They never said anything explicit about making holes more difficult to roll, just that the current mechanics make it too easy to lock down a system through rolling.
---
Not the point. I don’t care about losing a cyno. I care about people needing a long line of citadels to cyno to in order to get to deep null. Therefore further encouraging the blue donut of death. Being able to covert cyno opened up a lot of options for moving JFs through “hostile” space. It was going to be an interesting change to the meta. But... nah. Because boohoo we have to train alts a little more.  🙄
---
Nah I’ve been off the game for years.  At this point I can clearly say I do or just no eve at all.
---
Weird that this would go away, as it was really the #1 reason to use EVEWho in the first place
---
In my opinion your first corp should be a small 5-20 man corp thats got at least a few people regularly active during your prime time, small group that you can get to know and talk with while you learn the eve basics without anyone putting you under any kind of pressure.
---
New players without people to talk to will often just leave the game, because of eve's complexity it takes too long for new players to really understand anything in a reasonable time frame and there is no immediate activity that they can see that reward anything like a nice amount of isk so I think the most important thing for new players is the people.
---
Get them in, get them talking, they will stick around.
---
Yeah there have been alot of qol improvement.
---
*CCP locks cynos to covert ops*
---
  /r/eve &gt; REEEEEEEEEEE HOW DARE YOU CCP WHAT ABOUT- -
---
  *CCP changes it after community feedback to include t1 industrials*
---
  /r/eve &gt; REEEEEE FUCK YOU CCP I REALLY LIKED THE IDEA OF JF'S JUMPING TO COVERT CYNOS
---
  Holy fuck you lot are bipolar
---
1) Dscan doesn't use you shit, great now you are limited to the same 14,3AU of the system, while still having to refresh your scan every 5 secs at a minimum to retain any chance at making a catch.
---
2) Even if you get the dscan result, and then scan you still lose 5 seconds to that. Considering that you in 99.99% of cases you won't have any idea of where the cyno was lit you will not get a perfect scan pass on that JF. Which means you lose another 5-10 seconds to refine that result. In that time the freighter is long gone.
---
3)  You are losing additional time on flight time of the probes here, yes pre staging probes is a common techniqe, but it just doesn't cut it for the timeframe you have hunting for a JF jumping to a covops cyno. Pre-staging combats is great if you have time  to refine your dscan of the target and then get a 100% first scan pass.
---
4) Cycling probes is (atleast people i talk to) common lingo for refreshing your probe results. Just simplifies talking about how many times you had to adjust your probes to get the hit. ("I got a one cycle, shit was lit" "I didn't get the wormhole even after four cycles, and now the hostiles have hole control")
---
So... hypothetically, if JFs had covert cynos, they could cyno up at a safe spot and just warp to the station or gate. Right? 
---
But now it's basically back to cynos at stations, but in t1 haulers?
---
When I was a boy, we walked 100 miles through forests in UO just to get to our house! Then someone had robbed it!
---
Going to the Land of the masses tackling shit Well aware what lurks in shadows and then being suprised they got helldunked by said lurking Things.
---
Even though i dislike mar5hy i have to admit that BB is one of the few wormhole based operations that actually managed to adopt while all the others are suprised that 10 lokis are Not enough to kill a super before Support arrives
---
Forgive me for only being an average prober but my understanding was that probes only moved in space when you click analyze, and until you click that or recall them they remain where you last analysed (or dropped from cargo).

&gt; most people here don't know what they are talking about

  [Goon proceeds to reply saying they are concerned about ThE LiTtLe GuY!!]
---
It took you sooooooooo long.
---
To find out.
---
But you found out.
---
before it hits the server isn't the same as before people start taking action to accommodate the announced changes. I spent all of my stashed free SP training my cyno chain into covops cynos because it takes more than a month to actually train that, so now I have a bunch of characters that can light cynos I have no real use for that I have to train into something else, and who knows if *that* will be rolled back or not...
---
you sound fun at parties
---
CCP for making people dance back and forth
---
Lol, Right. Because we lose so many rorquals in delve. Excavotrs sure, but not really rorquals. Have you've ever been to delve?
---
I remember when CCP said they were focusing more on the official forums for devblogs etc- And reddit lost its collective shit over it... As if proving CCP's point.
---
Went there for a few weeks and left because it was boring.  
---
Nobody on except when the krabs ping and everyone logs on to finally use their multi billion caps on subcap fleets.  
---
Y'all deserve what's coming tbh
---
Because they're not half as smart or dedicated to the game as they say. If its not AFK mining or AFK ratting, they don't want it... too much effort.
---
$130 USD per year of eve online give skill points. Skill points remain in the game indefinitely.
---
Also

\&gt; Unironically defending Goons on a shitpost
---
Inexpensive ships are valuable in each and every battle. Small and large battles need frigates. Frigates are fundamental.
---
I don't know from experience, but I imagine a JF is pretty easy to probe down.  Might get jumped before you can enter warp...
---
Yeah I don't want that absolute shit game eve was back. 
---
What do you miss, grinding ihubs and stations?  Dropping SBUs?  Spamming POSes? 
---
Or maybe you miss  caps and supers moving completely uninhibited from 4 regions away?  
---
Or was it the total lack of ship variety?
---
I think the game needs to be more fun, and cynoes specifically exist to avoid encountering adventures.
---
Maybe something like instanced FW using filaments might do the trick.  Players joining instanced diamond-npc fleets, or raid-type content with player pickup groups might keep people busy.  Open world would be nice, but obviously no-one is capable or willing to figure out the basics.
---
New players could be kept more active if there were other gates on ~~sunk cost~~ character development besides time and isk.  
---
Kill Jita and expand market development opportunities for all players.  That's what most of them want to do anyway, so just give them what they want.  Getting demand to keep up with supply is obviously the big sticking point.
---
#PREACH IT BROTHER- I CALL IT RUNNING AWAY WHILE SHOOTING OVER YOUR SHOULDER
---
Exactly. And we will see that when the summer slump is over. Cya next spring.
---
Clearly not seen the new patch notes
---
You are still thinking too many years ahead
---
Eve sucked when it first came out
---
The fact that they are changing anything shows that someone some where is crying.the fact of introducing khaos into the game with cyno changes is irelevent to some people that play.We will just fit different and still rat. My opinion for chaos would be extending the range of being able to jump so as not to have to stage a assault but simply undock and jump to a enemy station,that would cause a shit storm . The fact that people are crying about certain systems and alliance's setting up a way of protecting their systems is silly to say the least. That should not be a reason for changes , maybe that should be a reason to change strategies on how you assault. So now alliance's and corps will be punished for protecting their own space because of the crying of others because they do not like confrontation when they go out to bank a poor miner or ratter. So here we go again with the changes when in reality the changes should be made on the part of the aggressor, but I can only say that this is my opinion and that change will cause different change and may not give you the result for which you had hoped for.The capitals were here and are here, learn how to defeat the drop not change the game for a easy fix.
---
Only two corps I know of have that as a requirement. Most of the rest are roamers, only a few put up 70-100 B/ISK in assets to have a farm hole.
---
A good bit less for c5 farms, but then you also have to deal with roaches all the time.
---
And in C6, there are so few of them that they're all seeded by HK/LZHX/etc. Then there are the other groups with C6 statics that can roll for a specific hole easily because statistics work out.
---
What's coming? What? The cyno change that CCP has just updated? Um ok, #hurtsthelittleguysmore. If your entire purpose was to shit post, why waste the time to post at all. Seems pretty sad to me.
---
"classic" in the context of a 16 year old game means how long to you, exactly?
---
AT lost all its fun when Eve Bet was shut down.
---
SCREW YOU TO ALL THE FUCKERS THAT DOWNVOTE, BUT THEN ARE TOO PUSSY TO OUTLINE THEIR COUNTERPOINTS IN A REPLY.  
---
LOOKS LIKE THE RISK ADVERSITY IS INGRAINED DEEPER IN THE COMMUNITY THAN WE PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT, FUCK!
---
Yea, but my cyno alt can tell if there's probes in the area before I cyno up. How would anyone know to probe? It's covert.
---
Goon Tears on a shitpost is delicious

&gt; Some people are vocally pushing for changes that aim to curtail, or even destroy, null empires' power, as seen from the Blackout and Cyno changes, but those are only trying to fix the symptoms, not the cause. Those changes would also make the game more time-intensive to play: for example, people will need to train up force recons to even deploy cynos, and have alts monitoring gate entrances while ratting. CCP has also said that WH space is too easy to navigate due to hole rolling --- and if they impose a limit on that, it would mean much more effort would be needed to play in WH space as well.
---
&gt; That's the last thing you want in the context of an ageing player base and an industry that is moving away from meaningless grinding
---
This is just so many words to resist the blackout and the cyno changes. Those changes will not solve most issues with Eve. But they will solve some, and are at a good direction.
---
What's unsustainable was the risk-free farming macroeconomy. Many activities require a lot of personal effort in Eve. Capital farming should have never been an exception. Eve is already a niche game where those unwilling to put the effort get lesser rewards.
---
In terms of a themepark game lik WoW, the status quo you are defending is like WoW giving Mythical level items to Normal level dungeons. It's just strictly against principles of a balanced game. Themeparks too aim to make their games easy to learn and hard to master as well. That's what Hilmar is aiming at by taking away precious super ratting and titan ratting from some players.
