I was holding down Capitol adjacent systems.  This was not just intended to catch boring ratters, but response fleets.  They stopped coming after a while, and without their support the ratters quit undocking.

 Holding the pod gives him time to unplug, never hold the pod.
---
Dual web no point works really well if you're letting them come to you, in my experience. I almost never fit a point on my "waiting for pvp" fits, maybe 1 in 15 warp off.
---
I'd agree with all of this except the Jump Fatigue removal. I do think it needs to be reworked though, to more accurately fit it's intended purpose of making it more difficult for defenders to instantly react to any threat and easier for attackers to exploit weaknesses.
---
Problem with outright removal of Jump Fatigue is that we'll get an even worse state of stagnation than we already have. Never forget 2014, with *literally the entire map* being a 50/50 split between N3 and CFC.

Had a carrier in low sec for 4 years before I skilled into all the support skills.

Still very much around and still in endless war + FW loving the lowsecs. Personally I want the billboard ads back so we can get messaging right in front of new players from the get-go, recruitment is probably still mostly done via referral and more obvious/blatant direct marketing works (in my experience anyway).

Do you have any thoughts on how to make it better, without losing the functionality? So it can still support fights of hundreds to thousands of people?

I think he means the default overview options are terrible. It's why most people are linked to the usual overview packs or make their own.

"Dirt &amp; Glitter". As for why the sticky flair is a reference to them now, I have no idea.
---
So are they discussing delaying sigs popping up for incoming whs?
---
And it really does need to be painted, as its UV cured. So will end up becoming brittle if it's not covered.
---
If you have an extra slot available for a probe launcher, you have no excuse not to fit one. Could save you billions if you get an expensive ship (or cargo, in this case) rolled out. If you can't fit one, carry a mobile depot, probe launcher, and probes in your cargo hold. If you don't, you're a moron (source: am often moron on this matter).
---
The CEO of a major corp, I believe it might be HK but I'm not sure enough to definitively say that, has a habit of not taking this advice and paying people a few billion to scan down an exit for him. This has been posted to Reddit on at least one occasion, but I know of him doing this in situations other than posts to Reddit. If you're space rich like him, you can get away with it. If you're not, you'll likely have to self-destruct.
---
Well, I have one Warp Core Stabilizer I who don't want to be permanently removed from my asset window. After some manipulations, I can remove it... temporary. It will come back again after few logins.
---
This module is cursed, it is haunting me. Someone help me !
---
...
---
I wonder if this bug is the same than yours. But still, I decided to stop worrying on that. After all, QOL patchs aren't a thing here...
---
Rolled out?
---
What is eols/rolls? What's being rolled on? And a steel roamer?
---
Edit: oh I think I get it, being stuck in wh space because the high sec hole rolled and some guy in a freighter rolled the other exit
---
Ok, how would you find the bubble camp without getting caught in it? A scout in front of the hauler?
---
One of the wormholes in your route home closed while you're out and about.
---
If you have an empty high slot, fit a probe launcher. If you have an empty high slot and not enough CPU or PG to fit a probe launcher, fit an offline probe launcher. If you don't have any empty high slots, bring a mobile depot and a probe launcher, so that you can take off one of your guns if you ever need to scan your way out.
---
Wormholes only live for so long (longest lived is ~22h iirc and average is more like 16h) and can only transmit so much mass before collapsing. So by jumping enough mass through the hole it will collapse, this is called rolling. So it's possible depending on how long you were out for that your return hole could be collapsed. 
---
Idk what a steel roamer is.
---
Because a week ago, some mod flaired every post with it.
---
Ah ok I see, thank you! D scan will pick up the bub? Or the ships, or both?
---
Oh, I read the first paragraph. BRAND NEW pilot pyfa’ing, coming up with good counter. I thought you were making a joke. The destroyer comment in a novice conversation just reinforced that inference.
---
Finished whining (to you anyway) about making this game more enjoyable for new players coming behind us.
---
Still better than the current situastion of near perfect safety. Best cace scenario they put drifter scrams and AI on every rat, worst case they put it on every trigger. Sometime in the next decade one can dream.
---
Can be one on the out gate, and if you do jump into one and escape, you're not stuck if there's a dedicated camp on all gates. Not always necessary but there's not a whole lot of other useful highslot modules for them.
---
Look at your corp killboard.

---
freighters are still easy to gank, you simply can't just have a mach bump one for 3 hours straight while you form people.
---
Agreed. I mean I was a *dishwasher*  at one point in life. That's possibly the most boring, repetitive, monotonous job I can think of. It was still more engaging and less tedious than isk making in EVE. The only pro that isk making had over it, is that I can make isk in my boxers without leaving the house.
---
When washing dishes for hours straight is more entertaining than a feature in your video game, it's probably time to give that feature a look.
---
I'd like to see new or modified FW content based on current assets.
---
-Deadspaces that don't allow warpouts/warpins or cynoes except in proximity to key nodes/beacons.  Slowboat travel between nodes is required.  Payout content is between nodes.
---
-More use of diamond NPCs to liven up the universe.  A diamond NPC vs diamond NPC fight let's players use non-standard pve fits to participate. (Ewar, logi, etc)
---
-Penalize stack purchases with LP to punish farmers and reward combatants reshipping (instant gratification).
---
-System development tied to modern structures.  System control wedded to pilot activity in ships.
---
-Buttons require a key to activate.  Costs LP.  Changes flagging rules in the site.  Reward is a physical object (datachip) scooped to inventory and handed in to any faction.
---
-Faction Hull/module BPCs that only work in industry installations in FW regions, and only in controlled space.  (BP system revamp ambitious, but welcome.)

Take them with a bucket of salt. Even if at one point in the past they made sense, no one takes care to keep them up to date with balancing patches.

You can get more than 24h hour holes..

A steel roamer is a ceo of a pvp corp. Your corp interacted with then once.

This argument was about why BO is OP not about cynos so dont even try this bullshit of derailing the whole argument.
---
Especially since Cynos arent gonna go anywhere anyway.
---
&gt;Carebears like you are the reason eve is dying.
---
So because people dont want to waste their time making less Isk/h in BO Nullsec than people in Highsec Eve is dying...   
---
It's definitely not because CCP introduced absolutely broken shit but never fixed any of it because that way they were able to double their gross earnings while having less and less actual players.

So, you *can* offline and online things that are fitted to your ship without a mobile depot.You just have to have 95% capacitor or above and enough power grid and CPU to online. If you're in a situation where you need your probe launcher, you probably don't need your tank and/or propulsion modules right at that moment, so you can offline them temporarily (no capacitor requirements to do so) and online the probe launcher. 
---
Just right click on the module on your hud and click online or offline as you situation requires. Or go onto the fitting window and click on the module.
---
Well la-dee-dah, that is a bloody relic

mhmm..
---
Keep on lying Jimbob. Keep on lying.
---
I did and I'm not very optimistic. It really seems like they are hoping tiny fixes will keep them from having to dive deep into how awful the tutorial is. It's boring and tedious right off the bat. It's also a lonely game. It's possibly the loneliest mmo ever made. Those are absolute killers for any product you're trying to sell. CCP makes a pretty game but they simply can't do content. None of this will fix that.
---
First off, I am all in favour of a T1 frig only plex. 
---
But a more expensive, stronger ship beating a weaker, cheaper one unless there is skill difference or a tacky fitting involved IS balance. 
---
The Worm is OP and I´d rather not use it as an argument, but Dramiel &gt; Firetail &gt; Rifter is just normal ship progression.
---
What would your ideal state of balance be? Everyone flying a Rifter?
---
Wow classics is based on a, 15 year old template. I wouldn't exactly count that as something to use in today's standards.
---
Classic 50 years old trashbag talking bullshit.
---
No. Not an exploit.
---
Once incursions were out for a few months and people were settling in, I had the opposite problem of people being way too disciplined when it's just a predictable PvE environment. Though once things really got going it was always fun to scare people by leeroying into sites with only a single logi.
---
&gt; It feels like CCP is again trying to chase the big Jesus feature update  
---
Did you even watch it? This is exactly the opposite to what they said (and already did)
---
They focus on smaller changes (maybe with big impact though) to fix and reset stagnating components. And Tiericide would be nice, but would not significantly act against stagnation. As he said in his presentation, there are few module sets that would actually have a big benefit of tiericiding. So they rather look at other small changes that cause stagnation.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
the next changes (1 month outlook):
---
* booshing
---
* bosons
---
* muninns
---
* flex structure positioning
---
neither of these changes can be considered a "big jesus feature", but every single one should have a some good impact
---
I could need that standing boost.
---
Expected a post on the glorious True Sansha’s forces, but I’m disappointed.

Did you just have a stroke when someone tackled your Rorq?
---
As a completely new player why the hell would you want to 
---
a) solo fight (known to be a high skill activity) 
---
b) get into pvp right off the bat (known to be an expensive-ish hobby, at every level)   
---
Get in a corp, get into fights with them, get small gang, get a couple of buddies in logi frigs, be stupid, make mistakes,  hunt tags in a group, i mean what the hell.   
---
You're asking for a feature that will drive people even more into solo play and that's plain wrong. If there's anything - the game needs more reasons and easier access to people grouping up not instanced duel areas ffs.
---
I mean that's hypothetical ofc
---
Or they could just take the advice that even hi sec isn’t safe.  His friend lost the cheapeast ship imaginable, now is a better time than any to learn that just because you’re in hi sec, doesn’t mean that every rat is a pushover

Yes

It's essentially been getting more and more lackluster every year. Ever since they fired the original community team.

Yes bombs can never be used as a mainline weapon, in a thread about stukas lmao.

Excuse me, but where can i find i pictures or anything about the trig dread you are talking about?
---
They don't even know how to balance it yet. That's like the most important thing.
---
I like your approach !
---
Honestly either put a nail in the coffin for good or start to get back the fucking awesomeness we used to have because this is painful to see and watch especially for a person whose spent 15 years investing in the game hoping it gets better.  Hilmat seriously needs to fcuk off now.  
---
Grath once said you are literally the fucking sids rotting the alliance from the inside.  This is Hilmar at ccp
---
Am I wrong, though?
---
Or enemies who dont dock up unless they are 3to1 in advantage with stronger ships.
---
Thanks for the suggestion. I will look more into it.
---
One key difference is that in wow or really almost any other mmo (FF 14, GW2,...) PvE will actually net you character progress where as in eve it will only net you ammunition (ISK for ships) which you will eventually loose. 
---
Additionally I feel eve is missing visually interesting pve? Shooting other ships looks somewhat unimpressive, give me those fat laser beams or stupidly spraying railguns aesthetic that i see in every scifi series.
---
Actions vs words:

You have a good point. A year long subscription brings the cost down to $10/month.

---
I had numerous friends play and quit and it always happened when they lost a ship and didnt have the logistics in place to have a supply of them ready.  If they died, they simply quit playing that night and likely never logged in again.
---
I think this could be fixed by making the free corvettes actually meaningful beyond a pod wrap.  Give them a customizable load out and make it so if modules are unfit, they vanish.  Hell you could even deduct isk when you hop in one and restrict the number of corvettes you can own to 1.
---
I'm not saying they should be great ships, but at least enough that a player can reship and come back as tackle.  Once they are used to being able to blow up multiple times, they see more likely not to get turned off by risk aversion.
---
it looks out of place compared to the subcap line. almost like some kind of moving gallente starbase or something like that with a singularity engine slapped in the center.
---
the art team missed the ball with this one, they could have gone for something reminiscent of the Vedmak with 3 petal-like portrusions around the singularity that open and close like a flower instead of that T-posing joystick with a few antenna on the tips.
---
Ouch. I feel that burn
---
Funny hint :          
---
Killmails don't show the wrap /container content for years if they are double wrapped. Same apply to cargo scanners due to some very old legacy code that cannot go more than 2 levels deep.
---
PGI has been pretty horrible historically
---
When Cersei Lannister said "Power is Power" this is what she was talking point.
---
This is a single upvote, but it is my upvote. Now it is yours op.
---
20 or 30k people regularly logging on for months/years, while complaining, does in effect mean that this conditioning has taken place.
---
The conditioning works because people have spent an imbalanced amount of time/ISK (which does correlate to money unlike other MMOs) and thus it's much harder to leave that investment behind. It's a sunk cost fallacy coupled with a real investment that people have put in (building their corporations/alliances etc., out of game software, you name it and it's probably been done for EVE..).
---
1. DT is 11am in Iceland
---
2. Lots of people made plans myself included
---
he was using a non-secure container.
---
I've been proposing something like you've suggested for a long time - basically a PvP learning system.   
---
My idea is dedicated non-FW 1 v 1 sites where only T1 ships of the same class can enter.   These could be setup in systems directly adjacent to high-sec systems.    New bros that wanted a taste of low-sec PvP can go sit in these sites in a T1 frig/destroyer/cruiser and once they are in only a single T1 ship of same class can slide in. 
---
The detractors will say that vets can boost/implant but my answer is only energy or cpu implants can used or no sliding, the idea is to try and make it as fair a fight as possible.  
---
Also anything with in 100km of the slide gate is auto de-cloaked.
---
Luckily our pilots career was not ended, just a setback. And we we left Theran as well :)

Didn't Jester Trek say(after his NDA was lifted) that everyone at CCP basically thought EVE is going to fail at any time for years? And that's why they pump all the money into side projects?
---
Stroke or Rorq?
---
It's also like a form of entertainment that people still find entertaining despite its shortcomings, and the people who find it entertaining continue to enjoy playing it because of the entertainment and social value, as opposed to whining about it not being better, complaining about it not being better, constantly reaffirm the fact you want it to be better, and couldn't possibly laud the game or developers when there's already so much effort going into shitting on something you're not even associated with anymore.
---
Don't compare my enjoyment of the game to a drug addiction.  Compare the constant need of some people to tell everyone how much they hate something they don't even consume as a drug addiction.  That's a more apt simile.

From the top of my head I'm pretty sure Omen, Maller, Punisher, Brutix, Myrmidon, Atron, Venture, Rokh... none of them have warp animations and I could keep going.

Basically only ships that got a model update after "x" date have it

You're gonna do a lot of learning and dying. But don't let it discourage you, EVE PVP is one of the most thrilling and satisfying things you can experience in your entire life.
---
My pleasure. You are welcome back anytime Becky.
---
CCP broke the game by allowing "asset safety".
---
Basically, for a small price, you can have all your stuff automatically teleported to lowsec.
---
which is dumb as hell.
---
This is awesome. You must add some way of only sharing it with corp and alliance mates. that will make this perfect
---
"Hostile Stations" don't exist any more. Your stuff is either in a citadel, which would mean you can use asset safety, or a station, which means you can dock in it, because only NPC stations remain.
---
you need to go to somewhere in nullsec that people live, not an empty region
---
\^this, or better yet, before you go driving industrials through nullsec, set up gate tacticals for yourself a few hundred or thousands of km from the gate. Then you can see what's what before you leap heedlessly at the gate. You may still get caught on the other side, but at least the enemy had to work for it.
---
I should get back in but nobody wants a character from the olden days who never did any block stuff.
---
1. Find buyers you can sell directly to
---
2. learn to manufacture stuff yourself
---
3. use alliance JF services to ship it to highsec
---
it's in wormholes.
---
&gt;This is something that requires zero dev time to implement.

Plenty of people have been conditioned by someone/something or have conditioned themselves to shit on whatever it is their attention is focused on.  We have a word in our language for it: curmudgeon.  It's someone who any time they speak about a topic, it's negative.  They couldn't possibly say anything positive about it because their brain doesn't let them pay attention to the positive things because there's anything negative they can focus on.
---
They are as much a detriment to the game, and have definitely been the cause for people leaving Eve at some point or another.
---
And don't even bring up the fact that people enjoy the game to them.  For these people, they couldn't possibly conceive a reality where someone could genuinely enjoy a game so shitty, even though they log in day after day.
---
Curmudgeons are usually shitty people who want other people to feel shitty about the things they feel shitty about.  When you don't feel shitty about it, you're the problem (in their eyes).  When in fact, we'd all be much better off without these people, instead.

EVE Vegas was the last opportunity this year for news that would show people there is stuff to look forward to and hope for, I think we can agree on that
---
There were no clear sweeping changes or a wide balance pass or a gameplay overhaul announced.
---
There were these minor changes announced, so these were the only tangible thing that people can hang on to because the presentations didn't really do much to calm spirits.
---
And now, you take this last bit of hope people had, the only update that was "simple" and easy to push through, and you delay your patch right after the big ass convention. It's poor planning/communication/management or a combination of these 3, and it looks bad because we've been waiting for big stuff to happen, and the small stuff ain't working out as smoothly as it should.
---
you can get a login for the wiki without being in the Uni. Then you can edit it and keep it up to date.
---
Come on back - for all the gnashing of teeth and crying on r/eve, it's not that bad.  It may not be as good as it was back in the day, but there are fights to be had, and CCP's improved some areas of the game - performance especially (less tidi, etc.)  Just come back as an alpha and do it for free to see.
---
&gt;The point is CCP, Develop a plan, stick to the plan, and show don't tell and you will earn your fans back so long as the things you have planned respect the players.
---
Seems they tried that and the game is on life support.
---
Anyone with a brain will be looting with a DST, which will be ungankable especially with CONCORD pre-pulled to the freighter location.

He’s clearly a big picture guy that doesn’t need to know silly small details like that for the product

Hmm, good point. What's the max ehp you can get on a DST? If there are enough tornadoes to kill a Providence then the same number is enough to kill a DST right?
---
&gt;the corresponding exit in the system the wormhole leads to only spawns if you:  a) initiate warp to the wormhole b) roughly \~4+ hours after the sig got scanned down with some rng thrown in.

That is not correct. your "b)" only happens if "a)" also happened. If "a)" did not happened, "b)" will never happen.

The tutorial is such a small piece of the problem but it is the first thing encountered in the game. I have never finished the tutorial since it's just unbearable. It's bad. Since i know they exist now, I go directly to the career agents. At least those feel like they are somehow connected to the game and clearly let you try things. They are a bit confusing because some of the missions really have nothing to do with that kind of activity. Still, they are significantly better than Aura, who is just nagging and annoying. Can't dump her fast enough. The tutorial is painful, boring and ( I agree with you on this) messy. 
---
Most of what they said at the presentation was what they had already done. Okay. This isn't actually going to do much though unless there is something engaging to keep a new player's interest. EVE is completely lacking in this. What tiny bit of marketing CCP does is poorly executed but does achieve the false expectation that you will be able to do lots of "stuff" in EVE. The reality is everything is very far off into the future. You will not be able to do jack. Plus, you will have to do it alone while being scammed and harassed by the player base. The players have improved a lot, but they have earned the terrible reputation they have.
---
EVE is also dependent on players filling in all the gaps like content and social needs. These are critical issues that CCP has left to random chance in the game. They are rewarded with the retention rate they have. The NPE changes will affect it in tiny percentages but will never create growth without other big improvements. It is ridiculously difficult to find a group in this game. Dotlan is your strongest tool that I've found. Personally, after reaching 24 mil skill points and several false starts I'm hoping that I might have found a corp. I've joined a few but I'm not in prime time zone availability so it has always been a solo pilot game for me. THAT kind of thing will lose more players than you gain. You may think that TZ doesn't matter but you are gravely mistaken if you do. EVE is not 24 hour.
---
The point is that pushing for a change that makes the site tackle people so a roll in is a guaranteed catch will just push people out
---
I know a lot of wormholers like to think that null dudes during the black out bitched out, but a whole lot of wormholers will follow suit regardless of what they like to think now.
---
if the way they generate isk for proper fleet fights is gone, they’ll go with it, all for the chance at catching a  shot for ratter because no one is going to fit anything worth killing if the site holds them in place
---
Easy fix.  
---
Ban FW members from docking in any npc station or citadel in FW territory.  
---
Turn the ihub into a dock with tether and clone bays and make it so you can dock there if your side owns the system.
---
Because changing a value to fix anchor distance is easy compared to actually taking the efford to look up all jumpgates coordinates and deactivating them.
---
I thought this might be from eveonion, then realized it was not. Color me surprised. 
---
CCP, CCP never changes.
---
If you are in Syndicate, then just ship it to Solitude. Lots of stuff sells there or gets moved to jita from there.
---
FW veteran here.
---
The first thing I suggest is get your overview settings sorted out. This is extremely important as it will display enemies in the correct order of importance. There are a few very good ones like SaraShawa, Z-S and my own AEGIS Overview which I initially designed while in FW (join the AEGIS Overview chat channel or mailing list in-game and follow the instructions).
---
Secondly, I recommend joining any corp in the Villore Accords alliance. They will help you in ways that will increase your skill level very quickly, especially with ship fittings and what to do when. If you don't want to join a corp, still try and make friends, FW is a co-op gameplay and lots of fun with friends. I loved the logistics of taking systems, etc.
---
Thirdly, when in space (yes, even in high sec) always use your dscan. Learn to reply on it as much as possible. Learn to use all it's features, like scanning a single direction or all around you at 360 degrees. Even in a fight hit the dscan button to see if anyone else is coming to join the fight.
---
When someone attacks you in low sec that isn't close to a gate or station, they get flagged as a suspect. That's why you got a notification. If they where at a gate or station, they would have been fired upon.
---
Don't worry too much about missions and just do complexes. Run down the timers and watch dscan. If a ship come in you can't fight, warp away.
---
Alright, I'm new to this myself and just wanted to defend my corp's image, thanks for the words
---
Much of this is due to the tradeoffs made to create a single-shard environment. The response time to commands given to your ship is way, way below what you expect in a WoW-type environment. That one facet of it alone dictates the level of excitement that can be packed in via mechanical interaction with the environment. When you add on the fact that the loss mechanics creates players with a very, very intense reaction to losing a ship, it also limits the constraints within which CCP has to plan a player experience. 
---
So that leads to a second big question: Would people support breaking EVE into multiple shards if it led to more engaging ship behaviors. I would bet not. So they gotta come up with other ideas, and you can see them trying with the Trig space environments. THey're making the environment more interesting to look it.
---
Haha :)
---
Quite smart trying to bait all gankers to Amarr so other places are safer to travel! 🤪
---
Just kidding. Nice event!
---
&gt; At least in wh space there arent cynos and a limited mass of ships can enter making population very limited. That is why delayed local works in whs and not ns.
---
This is my point - that it's not a lack of local or not knowing if someone else is in system that's the problem, it's the fact that they can immediately drop on you. (Limited mass is irrelevant to this discussion - you can drop 50 T3Cs or effectively infinite assault frigates on someone through a wormhole and that's quite enough to kill you.) So what should be nerfed as well as local is the ability to decloak and immediately cyno up.
---
"Experienced corps won't take them in"
---
Are you not aware of or deliberately ignoring the null newbie corps like Horde and Karmafleet? I'd bet on the latter, but you never know.
---
I noticed it saying that on some rando ships I have which are definitely shield tanked. Seems like good ole' spaghetti legacy code.
---
I'm pretty sure it's always been a thing. We just know more about it now and CCP is trying to help people learn to make their own content rather than telling them to "go back 2 wow".
---
For me personally, it's not about *my* killboard stats, it's about *their* killboard stats.
---
I don't want to give them the statisfaction of a 3b pod kill.
---
Gallente is armor. Don't be fooled by shield fits that work better. =)
---
The horror....
---
I have no idea how this event is supposed to work.
---
If you kill our rattle, we are forming to come and get you mate. That’s the attitude behind our space.  The goal isn’t the rattle, it’s the 45 minute long 25V25 fight after that.
---
(P.S. many of the rats already tackle. The difference is that we want the hard tackle shifted to the site triggers. This way, you can’t just ace tackle off immediately each wave.)
---
Dont you have to physically be at the station to trash things in the delivery hangar? Pretty sure you can't do it remotely.
---
What system? I can go there and give him some advice
---
You don't ask for much, do you? :)
---
Not sharing information to your entire player base is kinda stupid. As is intentionally tricking 10% with fake hoboleaks. Like what's so hard with having accurate and detailed patch notes released ahead of time? 🤔
---
He was ratting in 1dq1-a yesterday...
---
Any module group that still has meta 2/3/4 modules
---
Meh. Wormholers already do this.
---
Doesn't releasing accurate and detailed patch notes ahead of time actually require knowing exactly what you're going to do ahead of time?
---
Meta Defining

The first thing you got wrong is that eve isn't a PvP game. It's a PvE sandbox that allows PvP.
---
Ah the age old accidental poop posting accident.  I suddenly opened up pyfa to figure out how you could get it out to 100km.  God-Tier Abyssal rolls maybe?
---
It's not _that_ new of a CCP
---
No not on a scram. Max with heat, links, and abyssal is 50something pretty sure
---
lmfao no plate
---
Derp...
---
Played since 03/04 unsubbed when it all started to get modern and move away from being impenetrable and perversely difficult.
---
Shield Command bursts.
---
I think CCP might be on to something and am in full support - instead of introducing neat new features that will probably break initially they are focusing on fixing what is already in the game. We have enough shit currently - let’s chill out and see what happens when the knobs get tweaked.
---
Pathologically incompetent and mild liars
---
&gt;The formation of team Talos, a small team delivering quick changes every 2 weeks, was something we all requested for a long time and its finally here
---
Lol. This isn't the first time, I hope this time it'll stick though.
---
I dunno bout Syndi, but if the market there is as sh!t as others mentioned you could try selling completely fitted ships via contracts. No guarantee it ll work and it might include a lot of effort finding fits that are flown locally getting the parts you cant produce on your own imported and all that jazz. But IF it works you might have a monopoly there...
---
Ohh yeah that makes more sense
---
Thats the masochism-level needed out where we live, bro.

And that night as capsuleers in all manner of ships circled the haulers, spies on PushX comms suddenly heard "Everyone loginloginloginlogin"
---
As a member of CVA, I can confidently say that the only reason we've been able to stay in Provi is batphoning.
---
He's just jealous of their delivery efficiency
---
i prefer unannounced changes. i think there should be drops that just start happening without any advance warning. i like surprises.
---
This is missing an extra carrier some TRC boys caught on the Y-M gate in D61A, just a bunch of subcaps tackled and burned it down.
---
Who is RC?
---
&gt; We want new AI, balanced npc that present a bigger challenge and more rewards. 
---
It's called "other people."
---
You can also add gh0st#5614 if you’d like. I’m graveyard USTZ (so basically AUTZ) and wouldn’t mind giving you some pointers or roam around in cheap stuff with ya
---
The active FW corps are a ton of fun to fly with. Just chiming in to also recommend FW.
---
whoa dame death is still around?
---
"Noting the success of Azure Lane, we have instructed CCP and their art department to begin immediate addition and implementation of scantily dressed female ship avatars and their use in the game. Ship skins will be changed for clothing outfit changes with matching ship colors."
---
There's huge difference between doing PvE as way to fund your PvP and game being PvE with PvP elements. Game with PvP elements is almost every MMO out there, even world of warcraft is just that. EVE was designed with PvP as primary goal hovever and every mechanic leads to it.
---
Stop sniffing goon propaganda my friend they lie for their own agenda
---
Nice shitfit. The tooltip may be iffy but not as iffy as a blaster lachesis.
---
anchor a drag bubble and drop cans to decloak
---
Get Blasted

What are the burst jammers for?
