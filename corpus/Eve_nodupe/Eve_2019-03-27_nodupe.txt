Your already not piloting your ship in combat, what's stopping you from using your drones? Or you just wanna participate in fleets on autopilot ?....

There was a site like this posted a year or so ago, it displayed the % confidence a system was inhabited by botters, I completely forget the name though. Maybe some other reddit superstar can find it.

Don’t say that or Schist will go down.

I knew this day would come. Exit Strategy will continue being the bastion of AUTZ pvp in wormhole space even after the blue donut kills our structures. We will continue to roll like no other and you cannot stop us.

Omen is the most underestimated small gang platform in the game. Ashimmu worth a look with the hilarious prices atm too. Honestly beams of all sizes are slightly imba right now, it's hard to go wrong slapping them on anything

I’m actually doing incursions, I have to lock and shoot/web the right targets quickly. Or I’m Logi on 1-2 toons. I’m selecting the correct ammo for each DPS boat on each wave/room. All while watching my fleet, checking dscan and chat channels.
---
I’m definitely piloting all of them, I don’t know my APM, but feel like it’s relatively high compared to a few years ago. TPPHs are murder, having to deploy 3 sets of drones in 3 different rooms takes up to 15-20 seconds because of menus.

Closing excerpt below:  
---
This was our first relatively major fight, and I'm quite pleased we were able to come out slightly ahead/even (10.5b killed vs 10.3b lost) despite having barely 20 characters to their 50+ (not counting the frat bailout which only ended the content for everyone).  
---
Despite feeding almost an entire gila fleet, we were able to get GFs, several kills, and continue to reinforce the sov and structures of Quote (despite us being unable to form for the astra timer in EU today, we did re-RF it immediately after the events above).  
---
We're here to get good fights, regardless of the outcomes, the isk spent, or (most) odds stacked against us. It just goes to show that a tiny group of players can still create content and get relatively decent mid-size fights by leveraging skills &amp; isk against numbers to a certain extent. While we can't engage the massive blobs of local superpowers like Frat, we can engage in GFs with other groups, and hope to continue to create content here until it dries up or we decide to move somewhere else for more.  
---
If you'd like to fly in a small group of people trying to get fun content, our corporations (obligatory plug for my own corp - Everlasting Vendetta. - public channel "Oatmeal") are always looking for competent self sufficient people to fly with us while the game dies a slow death from bots, rorquals, and blobs of carebears.   
---
We're just here to inject a little chaos and try to have fun while we still can.   
---
Eve is dead. Long live Eve.  
---
Failheap is still around?
---
Does entr0x still run it?
---
Failheap's servers are still up.  
---
I don't believe Entrox still runs it anymore. The eve sections are largely dead, like the game. There's still the usual euro crowd posting in the general section I believe.  
---
I just figure if I'm going out ignoring the meta and doing my own thing, I might as well post in the place I used to. The little nostalgic things help a bittervet like myself. ;)

You can think whatever you want, but fact of the matter is that we had no problems with negwallets. Still don't, and if you listen to every schmuck ejaculating their excuses for posting on this bad forum, we're rife with bots in Delve. Somehow. Thinking is a growth area for those guys. Clearly, we'd be in more trouble now than we would have been with what you describe as a substandard rental program, yet things are fine.

And then the attackers get a special monument for visiting every system in Eve and go home. 
---
All the big bloc groups feed and get dunked once in a while, some more than others, because they actually take fights that aren't hardcounters and guaranteed victories.

If being good at EvE involves docking up if victory isn't 99,9% assured and you're mostly clubbing seals, then yeah you can call me shit.
---
Never thought the day would come that I'd defend TEST but here we are.

This is very likely what will happen when (if) CCP adds observatory structures. Local as an intel component will go away, but structures will be added to claw back a partial or at-parity intelligence network.

Lack of sales. Increased demand of injectors/extractors. Skins, more people perhaps using plex for gametimes.

It’s easy to make a misunderstanding, even with the best of intentions, in flat text. Emotional context for humans is very important. I can say that with absolute certainty because I’ve pulled a few serious boners by miscueing that.

I’ve met a good number of female pilots at Fanfest and I love their perspective. What I actually like about them is the fact that EVE is pretty opaque as games go. You have to want to be there. Not only do they want to be there, they are also very knowledgeable.
---
At one roundtable, female pilots only, they were asked “Do you want EVE to be easier?” **NO!!!** The women who do go there know what they’re talking about, they know what they’re doing. One of the hardest geek-outs I’ve had at Fanfest was an early morning breakfast at the hotel where there was a conversation on ship fittings, strategic goals and politics. One of the group was a woman with bright red painted hair and she owned that conversation as if she was teaching it.
---
A very early 20-something girl, at a roundtable, asks a question with such an exquisite understanding of the underlying philosophy and game mechanic that it brought a smile to my face. And not because ‘hey, girls are smart too.”, which only an idiot would think, but because: this young girl is enjoying the depth and the subtlety of the environment every bit as much as I do [I don’t regularly have the experience of women liking what I like a great deal, it’s my problem of being around the wrong woman]. It was exhilarating.
---
These women are not tourists. They don’t come just to see Iceland. A guy living about an hour away from me is there with his girlfriend. I’m fairly new to Fanfest at that point, I’m thinking “She’s joining the Sisters of EVE tour [if you don’t know already: it’s when the spouses or girlfriends of pilots go for tourist excursions while Fanfest is going on because they don’t join their SO which is, when you think of it, a blessing for them because they don’t understand fuck all about what we’re talking about]. This girl says: "no no, I’m a pilot". Really? Awesome! What do you do in EVE? “I’m a low-sec pirate, together with my bf here.” Another big smile on my lips.
---
I love hearing about women joining our merry troupe. Their perspective is welcome and I love knowing they’re there. I’m not saying I’m always socially adept around them, but I love women a great deal and it’s great to see them thrive in an environment like EVE.

AAR: Was contacted to evict the locals of that hole. Set up 24/7 HC, however the locals are awfully tenacious, after 4 hours of near constant rage rolling of the HS today POSPY managed to get in. We staged on the HS to try and keep it open for blues however enemy got more muscle in first. Had to exfil after loosing too many logi. GG would fight again.
---
This sounds like a great place for me!
---
Exactly my point, you have botters, all 0.0 groups do. However ccp deals with them, it's not ever a burden on the landlord. So when people assume CCP zaps the botters money, they're wrong. The rent they 0ay the landlord doesnt get touched.

They ban the botter and negwallet the corporation that received the taxes, though. Their goal is to neutralize the botter's effect on the ISK supply, not create additional punishment. Being negwalleted (sufficiently) has an indirect effect on a given renter's ability to make rent, just like botting has an indirect effect on generating rental revenue in the first place. CCP's gotta give the benefit of the doubt in a lot of cases; it can't monitor out-of-game communication, after all.

Yeah i'm sure that will be totally it.

It's not perfect but it's nice to let system geography mean something. It's a decent middle ground without outright catering to the "feed me free kills" crowd.
---
You breach the EULA you get the slap... if they aren't wanting to enforce the EULA thats fine then remove that clause... but you can't punish players for EULA breach on one hand then ignore clauses when it suites the vibe ;)
---
As does that mean "Automation" in EVE could be argued as folks with disabilities are able to automate behaviours using software in game to obtain parity is now fair game (aka botting and dumbshit like that). As cases can be made on both sides if thats the causation of the responses here.
---
Another thing people don't talk about is all those accounts that extract SP to PLEX their accounts (botters and normal accounts) use almost double the plex as someone that just buys plex with isk. About 450 plex for extractors and another 500 to plex the account. That's hot to have an effect on demand. 
---
Honestly this whole thing could have been avoided if I just didnt afk for a bit with 2 BS's left in a site to go check something upstairs, for some reason I thought my 2nd ship would be fine but then I was upstairs for like three minutes and come back to one of my dudes in a pod... literally all I needed to do was keep my shield module repping and I'd come back to being low on cap a bit but still alive and not out one ship... Lesson learned...

eve is a very tough game with very tough people. If words hurt your feeling and cause your saltiness, then my advice to you is just block or ignore them. It's not like they are bothering you is it? This is eve small unkind words hurt I question how have you survived in eve online or any internet environment?

Mhm! And the shopping list that begins to develop over the week or so of not making a run to highsec.

Oh and my scanning alt that im training into PVP needs these 3 skill books..

No matter how many times I do it though I always forget at least 1 thing... And then have to wait till my next adventure to high.

Wonder if HTP/PHEW would ease up on CVA if provi block actually tried to make provi profitable?

Frankly CVA could do with a standing reset and no not really go nbsi but save red status for people who actually disruptive. Example: Code

Cause frankly when youre in CVA everyone is red. What's the point of nrds?
---
If it can be proven they're botting, CCP should ban the bots. If it can't be proven they're botting, how do you hold a null alliance responsible for something not provable even from the server side?

As an african american who plays eve, go fuck yourself you pussy

Easily my most favorite, intense, and challenging snatch fleet I've ever fc'd. The fact that we infilled at all is a miracle with 2/3'rds of our fleet not making it inside on the first hole. GF's to all.
---
But they arent negating that isk, the bots still generate the isk paid for rent.
---
This isn't court, 100% proof isnt required for as anything.
---
Eve is a sandbox game.
---
when really get REAL bored sometimes we take a fleet to provi land and they tend to shoot us on sight.
---
I'm not sure why you think someone being competent and doing everything right has to die.
---
If someone fucks up, they should die but if someone is doing everything right, a hunter should have to put more effort into hunting than the person/group is putting in to stay safe.
---
Zeth from Micron here. It was my pleasure to bring you this content. You didn't get us last time but watching this snatch fleet in terror today was amazing.

Are you trying to reg-date me?  Lol.  I too started ages ago.  I also know that you don't know what makes a bot and what doesn't, mostly because you can't see your screen with your head shoved so far up your ass.

I was talking about FW, did you not read my post? But feel free to pass by yourself, even zkillboard supports my claim, have a look..
---
Was a great fight! Thank you so for showing!
---
Sounds like you're doing it right.
---
Instead of something like

"We take these matters seriously, we actively work to combat these issues. Names may slip passed our automated catchment processes, if you see these please definitely report them to us so we can take action. Thank you for taking the time to talk about this issue"  
---
Your response was to argue... and now you win the hearts/minds of reddit trolls...
---
I miss guard already.
---
He’s got them stain bucks..
---
Me as someone who hunts for a living, agree with you that the effort on the hunter to hunt should be larger than the effort of someone to protect them selves. At the moment the gap is just far too large. My problem is hunters can not do proactive plays there only chance is waiting and exploiting mistakes. 
---
I also disagree with your point that people who do everything. Right should not die especially in a game like eve where the actual gameplay generally is incredibly easy and the actions per minute are low.

---
guess what. i fit in.  i wonder why that is.
---
Chiming in for the Prophecy. Everyone thinks it’s some brick tanked cyno bait. It can be fitted with dual links and either rapid lights or triple medium neuts while retaining solid speed, dps, and projection. It’s one of the few things that stand a chance against jags with web, drones and multiple neuts.
---
Check my lossboard for fits 
---
....not sure there’s space in the car park for 13 coaches, four minibuses and an ambulance.

Kinda like banning the butter but not banning the shops that house them. It's like arresting the hooker and her pimp, but leaving the brothel she works out of alone
---
They could do something like ship/citadel fitting on a I hub. Kill local, then you can fit a high slot, Pirate locator or some suped up intel thing, but not both. 
---
Oh, I'm saying that the FC would have to push a button to set the fleet formation, and players would have to also elect to be part of that formation.
---
No fleet gate jumping, nothing like that.  Basically just a button that lets you anchor up in a coordinated way.  If you forget to anchor, you're still hosed.
---
Not even sure why everyone clutches their pearls about this shit anyway. Doesn't even meaningfully prevent any individual botter's ability to make isk. L4s are a thing, have been botted going on two decades now, and have infinite density. 
---
FW seems to be less dead recently, which has been good.  Its nice to see CalMil starting to revive itself and bring more good fights.

---
I'm not saying that someone who is doing everything right has to die, I am saying that currently if you do not make any mistakes, and sometimes even if you do, you are unable to be killed. Neut enters system, instantly enter warp because you are pre aligned, mess that up and get caught, light cyno and 50 faxes/dreads/carriers drop on field to save you. Hunters should need to put effort into catching someone, but currently they can really only catch people who are not paying attention

Was pretty wild jumping in without having eyes, and not knowing where any of the other fleets were. I've heard that we were the armor brick that went in first to draw fire from the confessor fleets.

I jumped in and said "oh... that's a lot of ships... okay... friendlies where?..  whatever, let's go dudes"

Whoever was the jump dessie that literally booshed the fleet off the hole, and then whenever booshed us back. That was a beautiful return. Split out guards, then put them right back together. Was awesome.

I'll help you baseline that moment...  GTA 5 took approx $265 million to make..thats from File-&gt;New-&gt;Project to shipment to marketing .... CCP just got that much and another $200 million yet to come for Eve.  
---
Prior to this its estimated that CCP are raking in around $50-150million depending on the noise guestimations that take place... You're saying that having automation and features that check for EULA breaches is a bar to fucking high and that we should be thankful at best for CCP's responses to date.

No wonder this game has no fucking growth.

I was deep in the wardec system back when it was reworked into the mess that it currently is. I was around for all the iterations through dec scraping and corp hopping in space and every other abuse. Hell, I'm part of the reason Crimewatch 2.0 exists, which took neutral logi from nigh-invulnerable in wardecs to at least being suspect. I've been on the offensive side of hundreds of wardecs and had a lot of fights that were fun for both sides.
---
Where PIRAT and others ruined the system was in spamming decs so they could engage in their risk-averse hub camping, and their neutral logi.
---
The system as it stood this time last year could have been much improved by simply removing neutral logi and by reducing the number of active outgoing wars. That would put most of the toxic wardecs to an end.
---
If he wanted to tank prices, would it be better to split the order into smaller descending orders to "lower" the orders without creating a "firesale" effect?

Right so we have a single persons opinion as one of the genders .. good to know .. appeal to authority locked in..

That’s all right?
---
Yes!  Even if there were more risk involved for the scanner.  It would be great as I love the cloaky intel stuff in this game.  
---
There’s more of us than there are of you pumpkin.
---
welcome to eve?
---
CCP doesn't give a fuck.  Bunch of white Europeans that are perfectly fine with racist, sexist behavior.  
---
Hahaha I was going to say .. mate you need to recheck your browsing habits as those ads are based on the OP usage of the net not random ad cycles
---
Lol
---
Lol I just spent an hour and a half scanning down in our C5 chain, then everybody decided to roll our C5 :)
---
Why rr-domis instead of domis+oneiros/guardians?
---
Considering none of the Hel's were supposed to be fielded, it would sad if it was offered. 
---
Pro tip: spamming control space will cancel your "warp" command *and stop your ship* but its quite laggy and you might die by the time the server ticks to let you dock.
---
Good to know but bad to rely on 
---
Woah who let an Injun like you post.
---
Ah so just a UI bug, thanks
---
Pricetag has a fair amount to do with it I'd assume. Plus since high-sec indy corps are in question I'd assume a lot of those domis were stashed hulls waiting to be hauled to market.
---
No, because that enormous amount creates a price ceiling that won't go away, while underbidders cut away at the margin.
---
Also probably has to do with skills. In a HS indy corp not sure how many t2 trained logi pilots you'll find, but *everyone* can fly a domi.
---
It cloaky
---
So it would be good gameplay to do everything right to keep yourself safe and still die to some braindead hunter?
---
2 tril?
---
577000 * 4120000 = 2.37 tril
---
Was just yesterday that I had a clutch 5j amarr two holes down my c5 static and I really had to bring a buttload of mins to build multiple caps while I had the chance. Im fortunate/autistic enough to have several cloaky eyes to monitor the chain for the multitude of trips I had to make in a day, but the chain wasn't completely silent. 
---
Between the day tripping scanners, random sabres looking for a quick snack and roaming gangs moving to their respective ops, my runs to and from high sec were mostly uneventful until a tengu chased me back home on my last run (which was just extra fuel) but cloak and mwd saved my butt through each jump.
---
That's wormhole logistics for you, and I love it!
---
I’m drawn to this skin like a Pandemic Horde BlitzKrieg fleet to capitals 
---
TTT Cant even hold the high sec market together. With that said, test does not have any idea what they are doing. So they have to hire pirat to hold high sec for them. Shame. PH DID IT BETTER.
---
Only if you can afford to lose it.
---
I'd like to report the corp named "SNIGGERDLY" (SNIGG) for being offensive because it's run by a mean old doodie head
---
It's a good option if you can already afford a few. If you can only buy one or two (fitted), stick to T1 exploration frigates for now. You can keep the reward to a similar level for a much lower risk.
---
mfw that actually used to happen. RIP Heavy shield fleet in home
---
Eh, I mean even people that bought it towards the top of the peak, just have to hold onto it a bit longer... it'll still start climbing up again. Just won't be a quick turnaround profit like they thought.
---
Well, even t1 logi cruisers are better than rr-domis at repairing, and all of them have skills for that
---
Unless he's making a cap alt. I have the isk but im not paying for that bullshit markup on cap skill books.
---
No, if you do absolutely everything perfectly you would still be able to escape even if a hunter did not appear in local for 30 seconds. If you are pre aligned and hit warp as soon as you see them landing on grid you will be able to escape
---
I really want this and if I lose it I'll be a bit upset but otherwise okay. -&gt; Buy it.    
---
I really want this but if I lose it I'll be very very upset. -&gt; Wait.       
---
What Philippe said. If you're just going to dip your toe in the occasional wormhole you don't need an astero. But if you're going to make a living from wormhole sites the cloak is an essential travel tool. 
---
Astero is tanky enough to fight other explorers, but not much else. 
---
Dairy Queen Prime
---
Brita is a German company and is pronounced as Breeta there :3
---
You ever stop to consider that the pilot may actually be an Indian?
---
Yeah, better they hadn't gone but it was a good faith response. Alliance should carry the cost, like it did at Oij.
---
Bought one for the Kronos.  I too wish they would have done it for the Moros but hey the Kronos is a Baby Moros anyway.
---
I dont think any alliance replaces supers lost where they shouldnt be
---
This really made me smile. 
---
Best of luck to you all!
---
Yeah, listen to the guy who doxx's people on accepted social norms. Great plan. Please stop fucking posting.
---
yes
---
Krusual SKINS are my favorite SKINS in the game. Those are just... sexy.
---
Member when gms teleported imperium supers in yulai to be destroyed? Or that isn't considereed botting as well? 
---
So the station hangar was covered pretty well, but logging out might not be terribly clear to you.
---
If you are docked inside a station and log out, you disappear immediately regardless of everything else.
---
Stop reading here if you always logoff while docked in a station, its the safest way to do things (but it isnt always available).
---
If you are undocked (ie in space) it can take anywhere from 30 seconds to 15 minutes before you will log out.
---
The easiest and safest way to be sure you will logout in 30 seconds and not get killed is to hit escape, and then in the lower right corner of the window will be a box saying "Log Off Safely". This is referred to as "safe logging" and the option is only present if you are undocked.
---
Its possible you will get a message telling you that you cannot safe log for various reasons (modules being active, not being completely out of warp, being in a fleet, or most importantly having a timer). In order to safe log you will need to [wait out your timers](https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/203208932-Weapon-and-Logoff-Timers)
---
As others have said, if your client crashes (or you just quit the client without safelogging (and life calls so it happens don't worry about it)) your ship will (in general) try to recall any drones you have, deactivate your modules, and ewarp (or emergency warp) to a site off grid where your ship will remain until all your weapon/logoff timers expire and your 30 second log off timer ends.
---
**BIG IF HERE**, if someone is aggressing you you will not lose your logoff timers and your ship will not "disappear" until they have made your ship ~~disappear~~ explode or you somehow lose the aggression timer. This includes NPCs, though generally you should worry more about the other players. NPCs will lose their warp disruption on you eventually and your ship will ewarp out of the site to wait out the non-capsuleer logoff timer. Players will not lose their point, and even if they do, they have 15 minutes to combat probe you.
---
Do not close your client thinking that you will somehow survive when someone has started attacking your new shiny ship.
---
The difference between the T1 ships, the T2 ships, and the Astero are hacking strength and ability to defend. The astero is the only one with any offensive capability.

Just had something like this happen in my community. It made me pretty fucking sad because, as a CEO, I do my best to make everything as inclusive as possible. I pretty much ban politics outside of an opt-in channel because it always goes badly. We had a person that I thoroughly enjoyed playing with for well over two years. She was polite, stepped up and did things when nobody else would, etc. She had a radical shift in personality over about a 3 month period that made everyone walk on eggshells around her, to the point where several community members just straight up wouldn't join channels because of how meme(y) and confrontational she got. This eventually led to a big blow out where someone made an off-hand apache helicopter joke, someone who is in his fifties and is one of the nicest people in my community, and she blatantly told the server that essentially if you didn't agree with her on all of her political stances you couldn't be her friend anymore, and that those jokes were a grievous attack on her personal character. It was pretty fucking upsetting to me because I legit feel like a completely irrational, social-media infused, an always-looking-to-be-offended person got into my inner circle. It's definitely heartening to see someone say this, because when I said something similar, I got labeled as a bigot and intolerant, despite the person saying this actually being the intolerant one. The bad apples in my corp have always managed to weed themselves out, whether it be racism, sexism, stupidity, etc. I just never thought it would wind up being someone I actually respected over something nobody actually had a problem with.
---
The fuck is my Hyperion skin?!?
---
If you are asking, you really shouldn't. Consider the ISK you have. If you have enough to buy 50 asteros, go for it. When I was a lowsec allbymyself eve player, I made sure to play it safe and make back the money I put in any ship first. But made my first bil with an astero too, and promptly lost it in a gatecamp, first loss ever. Aah good times. Tell you what, I'll give you 50 mil to go buy one. Give me your ingame name.

why not you hoser
---
IT has good offensive ability, it is also one of two covops frigates that don't require training any frigate to V, and the other one is probably too expensive if you are worried about the cost of an astero.
---
I think "often" might be pushing it
---
Hello I was there
---
It also helps to have spares of everything, so that way you can wait for a convenient connection if you do lose something instead of needing to replace it immediately.

Why not headhunter?

Ccp wants idiots to swipe card and inject into big things and fly them. I dont see anything like that remotely on their agenda.
---
It's been doing this to me for over a month.
---
the trailers of eve are misleading, you get sucked into this game thinking just behind the next alt and train queue you'll finally find the "it" in eve... but what you actually end up finding is a woefully inadequate development team, which has kicked the can down the road for nearly a decade and will soon be out of bells and whistles to shower the newer players in 
---
T1 logi cruisers are much worse at surviving vollies of torpedoes though.
---
If you can fit a Covert Ops cloak, then yes. If not, then... probably no
---
Other one?
---
Did I ever once say that there are not botters in Delve?  No.  I stated that the PvE does not equal botting.  Using the MER is inferring that everyone doing PvE in Delve is botting.  When folks are caught botting in Delve, they are kicked out.  Something that does not happen with most other groups.  
---
Providence is Not Red Don’t Shoot. So unless you’re against them, you’re good

5ISK?????????
---
Quick, don’t worry- I’ll buy em for 1,000ISK but you gotta hurry
---
It's a made-up word. Pronounce it however you like. But only a mongtard would pronounce it jitta.

Like the second graph in the link below or something different?
---
http://evemaps.dotlan.net/system/3-QYVE
---
It's never been Risk vs. Reward. it was always Risk+Effort vs. Reward. Effort mitigates risk and keeping a sov alliance running is huge effort.
---
Not everyone that pves in delve is a bot. I menat that delve is very likely the region with the moat botting income, as per the mer. 
---
Nice bait
---
Fake, it has a cyno.
---
Reminds me of when I first started and everyone in the game was still fairly new.
---
Pacifier, the concord frigate
---
200m/h needs you to complete a site every 6 minutes. Good luck trying to do that consistently.
---
Sure there might be occasional TCRC wall, but that's a rare outlier, and is gone before you know it.
---
Or the AI connected the word “EVE”?
---
what im saying applies to incursions too you know
---
The pacifier. It is a rather problematic ship that is good for niche uses, but lacks the combat capability of the astero and is generally to expensive for what it dose. It's best use is for scanning Thera.
---
when was it 4.6?
---
What's the difference between a simulated at by the art team and the at of the last years where the winner was already known beforehand? :thinking:
---
You can make a decent 75-100 mil/ hour ninja huffing c5-6 gas in wormholes. You need to get a 25mil skill book and a 3 mil venture and scanning skills. Scan the gas site, activate miners, and warp out when the sleepers arrive.
---
They did fight though...?
---
Disowned Hero’s channel has some good guides.
---
But there is no proof.  Wow, CCP moved what, 2 or 3 folks?  That doesn't mean everyone is doing it, or even that there are a ton.  They just happened to be the ones they grabbed. 
---
I would venture that the majority of bots are in the dronelands, as it is shit space that does not get roamed nearly as much as Delve. 
---
Running a bot in Delve is stupid because of the constant state of neutrals in system would cause you to lose ISK.  You would need to go to a far, out of the way place in order to actually make any ISK.
---
Places such as Omist, Oasa, or Cobalt Edge.
---
The reason for the high MER numbers is not due to bots.  It is due to a MASSIVE amount of people living there.  But you go for the easy answer, instead of looking into things.
---
We need more pew pew in this game
---
40m per month per planet.
---
You can (if you're talking about the suspect timer). But you can't jump through the gate
---
I think the bigger surprise is it took this long TBH, anyone with a brain expected something similar a long time ago.
---
an astero isn't an exploration ship, it's a cloaky combat ship that happens to be able to explore. the advantage of having one over a standard exploration ship is that you can beat up the other exploration ships and steal their lunch money.
---
the *disadvantage* is that this can lead to overconfidence. people fit asteros for both exploration and combat at the same time, but this will lose a fight to pvp-fit frigates.
---
We evicted those hk noobs while pets like you came along 
---
&gt;But there is no proof. Wow, CCP moved what, 2 or 3 folks?
---
Except that very direct proof there also the fact that bot reporting is punished, the biggest supper cap umbrela that heavily favors rorq input broadcasting, capital and super botting and the fact that goon csms tried to take down the mer in the past. 
---
Yeah I guess legacy wouldn’t have any

So after 5 years and 1 day of Eve Online I finally lost my first Jump Freighter.

I meant that there are plenty active FW corps and that there are no shortage of FW fights to be had.

Both of those have great guides and information to be gathered from them, sort by most viewed if you want
---
I see some confusing answers to this so here's the real answer to your question.
---
If you log out while docked, your ship disappears. If you log out in space, it depends.
---
If you have engaged in combat you receive a logoff timer (I think it's 10 mins). It will appear in the top left corner of the screen after you engage in combat, even if it's vs. an NPC.
---
If you log off in space while this timer is there, your ship will sit in space until the timer expires before disappearing.
---
As for station hangar - that's everything stored in a station. Your inventory in the station, as well as your ship hangar, will stay there.
---
When you undock, you take with you the ship you are aboard out if your ship hagar (the rest of your ships remain in station) as well as anything in it's cargo (not your inventory as a whole, just whatever is in the ship's cargo).

It is very exciting to go pvp in a 400mil frigate filled with exploration loot, though
---
It only happened to me three times...
---
What were you using to move stuff? 
---
so wait, you think that pl and nc haven't done more damage to providence than any other alliance? i mean, code has some high sec greifers and now they have the same wh roamer that have always come, but code is and has never been anywhere near as hostile to providence on a day to day basis.
---
I guess you don't understand botting at all.  If there are neutrals in a system, they all run and hide.  Delve is constantly being roamed and camped.  Not good for botters.  
---
Input Broadcasting is also against the ToS.  If caught, they are expelled.  Also, it is not the same as botting.  Please, get your groups we all hate straight.  
---
As far as them trying to take down the MER, that had nothing to do with botting.  Only a fool would attempt to connect those dots.
---
As far as your 2-3 bots.  Wow.  CCP got a few bots from us.  They also got bots from a lot of other places.  They also flat refused to go after a few others.  I'm thinking you need to look beyond the CSM for your "who has the ear of CCP".
---
If you see a bot in Delve, by all means, report it.  I don't care.  The more that are expelled, the better.  But your inferences are misplaced.  You are attempting to point towards something that is not proof of rampant botting as proof.  That is where you are mislead.
---
After GSF was evicted and were living in Nullsec, the MER would have had others on top.  Were they a large contingent of botters as well?  Again, just because there are a TON of folks playing in that region does not indicate botting activity.  It indicates that we have a TON of folks in Supers ready to fuck up the day of folks that would drop us.  And guess what, we drop them.  
---
Take a look at ZKill at the Dronelands at all of the Supers killed with absolutely no one there to save them, even though there are a lot of Supers out there.  That is because if no one is at the keyboard, there is no one there to scream for help.  
---
In Delve, they get on comms and get help, indicative that they are at their keyboards actually playing.
---
Have a nice day!

Hm. Space taxi anyone? For a stupid but fun idea, how about a T2 cloaky hauler like a br with specialized cargo meant for hauling pods.

&gt;As far as them trying to take down the MER, that had nothing to do with botting. Only a fool would attempt to connect those dots.

I'm interested what the reason was then. Not going to adress the rest of your points because i believe neither of us will change their mind. 
---
mjd but instead of jumping the fighter 100km, it jumps the ship directly to stain from lowsec
---
If you can't fly a T2 with CovOps of at least IV it has the best scan strength. You can (and should) fit it with a CovOps cloak. And it gets easily to a sub 2s align time.
---
New alliance incoming?
---
It does *not* have a higgs rig.
---
It is *not* fully cargo expanded with salvagers in the highs.
---
It doesn't even have small armor repairers or structure repairers.
---
It *is* a bad fit. It's not close to the worst I've seen.
---
This is basically how I used to recruit for Dreddit back in the day.
---
honest answer: provibloc consists of these alliances:
---
http://coalitionsin.space/##coalition_10 - elemental tide (not sure why they are still listed) 
---
as well as the non hostiles that live in providence and npc and conduct honest day to day buisness to try to make providence one of the thriving regions of eve.
---
Goons are by nature NBSI (as are most larger blocks) so we generally have standings to them that reflect that they will shoot people in the area. that is to say that all "reds" are not equally as bad. as we see it, we can have relations with hostiles and even if they disagree with us and want to shoot us, as long as they respect our borders and don't generally we can get along with and or communicate too, we usually don't have a ton of issues with them. There are some who have been historic issues (PL + NC. , PHEW and ARTON dudes for examples) who are generally more hostile to us then most average reds. For the most part, Reds come to Provi to roam, shoot random structures for a fight, and hopefully they have /get one (as well msot of us like to pvp). as per the question at hand, Goons are red to cva, but they aren't always hostile. As seen several times those who are red but align with our own interests and or offer assistance at times have granted acess / assitance and standings for the time we are helping/working together. 
---
As i said before, if we can come to an agreement with people before hand and they need to move through provi or use provi services, they can. long as they can behave while under those terms.
---
the problem with standings from a CVA /Providence point of view is this : CVA could easily be blue with test, goons, pl, nc, or whoever we wanted to be blue with. CVA would not get shot at by them, and cva would have no issues with them becuase of that. but the problem lies with and is with everyone else in providence. Its not just about cva  or the sov holding alliances its about making providence a place where open and free trade exists, making way for the empire to someday claim providence.
---
building a civilized region. therefore, people need to know who is most likely hostile to them. so we have a kos list that has goons and test and pl mostly because smaller entities need to know who will shoot them. 
---
so tldr : 
---
goons are red, 
---
sometimes blue, 
---
sometimes dead,
---
and sometimes we let them through. 
---
They are KOS, so expect them to shoot you unless told otherwise  :)
---
Its really hard to believe that IRL pilots in the fighters just shut their engines down after each kill.  I get that a lot of mechanics aren't realistic, but this is a particularly counterintuitive one.
---
You do realise that you never have to touch your mouse to rat with fighters? It's all bound to your keyboard.

---
Wrong approach, response fleet is the problem.
---
As long as nullsec have such resourse and anomaly density things will stay as they are.
---
But imagine nullsec getting nerfed, let's say anomaly respawn rate is 1/4 of that it was and asteroid belts take 4 days to recover.
---
Awful, right? But player density in nullsec would drop dramatically, some will move to lowsec, this will actually help sad state of pve.
---
As for rorqs, they are fine. It doesn't matter how hard they are nerfed, it will only hurt small collectives, big boys will stay 100% safe with no need to worry about anything. It would be much better if there was "mining efficiency" modifier for drone mining, let's say 50% and with same rate. Belts would deplete faster and with that, sure, you mine with same isk/hour, but you will have to move to other systems and plan days ahead you mining schedule. 
---
And it would be good for small mining groups, they will not be forced to mine in rorqs to compete, they will be getting most out of their space with, let's say, hulks. Big collectives on the other hand would be forced to have moving mining fleets and ability to project power on daily basis would define how much ore they can get, on the top of that there will be new ways pvp oriented groups to hunt and many more ways to trap and possibilities for spies. 
---
Hell, you wouldn't mind then to increase mining speed in order to compensate and do same for ratters.
---
THERE WOULD BE COMPETITION FOR SPACE ONCE AGAIN and not for botfarms but for actual people.
---
It was more about go split fighters into the groups and instead of issuing commands to a single fighter - do it to all of same type. 
---
I wonder how big Icelandic air force is .....
---
I did the math on a spreadsheet at some point. You lose about 50% if you want to do it for free, less if you buy your own extractors.
---
Goes like - pony up for 1 extractor, extract and sell. This gives you cash for like 3 fresh extractors. Extract all and sell one, keep one. Buy 3 more extractors. Repeat until you reach 5 mil sp.
---
Then inject at regular injection decay.
---
Hahahahaha! Thank you so much for posting that. I love that video!
---
No. The best exploration frig is a T1 without a cloak. Costs less than 1mil fitted, one relic site can easily give you 30 times more
---
I think if you are afraid to lose a JF you probably don't need one. I always thought it was a tool for heavy duty users like nullsec market suppliers and industrialists. It's nice to own one even though it isn't necessarily "worth it" though.
---
Having reds means there is fun to be had, it's a game based around pvp after all :-)
---
Well the playerbase consists of autistic boomers so...
---
so in which ally you have your cap ratting spy alt darling?
---
He is saying stop being biased on reporting and being turds not report to discord on how not to be.
---
Logi are always going to be relevant. Now you have T2 frigate logi as well, which put out some spicy reps (and have a space for a whore drone).
---
Ferox
---
Urban Dictionary, the new wikipedia? 
---
Hell yes. Logi is still used a ton and now you get so many more to choose from. Besides the T2 frigate logi already mentioned, there are also Triglavian logi ships (Rodiva + Zarmazd) and T3 cruisers that can function as logi.

You'll love it.

That’s not how APM works. You only have 1 mouse. You can only do 1 thing at a time. If you have 1 account, you devote 100% of your APM to it. You’re limited by your inputs, and the “assign to” menu is way more than 1-2 actions and shouldn’t have to be. Do you have any actual, useful, constructive criticism?
---
That's the hill you want to die on? Let's not even address Provi Bloc Diplo in general but because I said Code over NC.? Or PL?
---
Let's not talk about the issue at hand just side step that shit?
---
Okay fine, fuck those guys. Feel better? Now about CVAs gross habit of chanting "we have a long memory" but refuse to learn shutting people out only limits their options.
---
Providence doesn't have a unique resource or easy to defend position. You can't god father Diplo and expect people to respect you first just because your old. Provi is huge and requires a lot of team work to make the dream work.
---
Remember the Citadel? Remember the North Provi channel and how it almost split provi Bloc? People defending down south couldn't reliability go to say 9UY so defence got split, sub factions formed.
---
Provi Bloc almost lost everything forever. There's a reason you have that upwell bridge to 9UY. If that thing falls for any reason you're completely cut off from care factor again. Sure you can Titan bridge but how long before that becomes tedious?
---
Don't get me wrong I love you guys but you got to face reality. To quote LOTRs,

It's not like PIE is going to jump a cap fleet in to save you when you need it most.

Stop trying to ruin the best game ever with your SJW bullshit. Keep that crap in your Marxist infiltrated "university".

Someone suggested Eveiseasy few days ago as well, but some of the videos seem to be old, I suppose it doesn’t matter mechanics wise, correct?

Looks cheap. It’s not even a full skin, but rather 1 texture applied on top of the existing skin. I don’t get all that excitement you guys have
---
Lmao, I read what you posted before reading your name.. I thought this post was made by stainguy 😂🤣
---
remove excas, or make em fighters, w/ a less powerful, less expensive T1 standard variant w/ the EXCA being the faction variant 
---
Keep in mind this is in space, you might as well eject from your space ship and “swim” through space back to your station hahah.
---
And actively shoot rocks in your rorqual all night long!!!
---
my ice rorq only has 3 excas as i never bothered to spend another 2.3b isk on 2 more drones when ice is already giving me as much isk as it is w/ 3

Probably shouldn't name your drink "bad" if you want people to drink it.  It reminds me of Nutrific, "It's nut very good!"

someone buy a 24 pack and send it to Boat hes not been jumping so much as of late
---
who said anything about anyone doing anything on their own until you made it up just now?
---
Because it gives intel to our enemies and invites folks to come to Delve to try and kill us.
---
Aryth fought against it because he did not want people to know how rich we are getting.  That is a bad thing.  Without the MER we would have appeared weaker, longer, thus, when we attacked, it would have been more of a surprise how prepared we actually were.  Of course, it still came as a surprise to the rest of Eve after failing to destroy one Keepstar (goons won't commit!) when not only was a full Super fleet deployed that was large enough to be incontestable, but there was an equal force at home still dropping on folks (just not as much, because fuck krabs who don't deploy).
---
Well I joined 3 “FW” corps and left them due to them having barely any active players, I could of possibly joined the wrong ones, but 5-10 players online and 2-3 actively doing something, I wouldn’t consider that very active.
---
Apart from the 10 man gate camps around black rise, I’d barely encounter any fights, also yes there is plenty of FW kills, but how many of them are solo? As of the time of this post, there’s 25 solo kills in the span of 4 hours, that’s 50 different players, now what are the chances of me being 1 of them and finding another fight after my first encounter? Btw I’m talking about black rise alone, which is supposedly the most active FW area..
---
Anyway, I was just giving my personal experience/opinion. Maybe I’m just unlucky with finding people.

just get a couple of rolling ships you pleb :)))

jokes aside yea I also love the shifting nature of whs (the mapmaking part is awesome) and the fact that the environment being so hostile makes people stand together even tighter. 
---
Narrative? False? You literally doxxed someone. You don't get to just apologize on the sub and then people pretend that you didn't do it. 
---
Imagine living in a c4 with bad static setup and complaining about it
---
As far as i can tell none of the fundamentals are different. Just the ship types some and some of the numbers.
---
this graf is bullshit
---
Drag 'n drop from drone window on a pilot in fleet/watchlist would also be nice.
---
Yeah, Chichou stopped playing and no one at least from my understanding was around to sort it out or take command when HECON was dropped from FW. So those guys left and formed into The Pannion Domin, Salt Farmers also proved to be good for the calmil as one of its most recent note worth additions.  
---
While United Fleet continues to be a force to be reckoned with. Right now EU TZ calmil is the strongest it has been, I would even say its much stronger then it was when HECON, CALSF, and BLOC were leading the show but I could be wrong too, who knows.
---

Why 
---
I support nerfing nano as it is overpowered.
---
I get it. It says bee.
---
I noticed the ship types, by that I mean he had a video about interceptors, the raptor to be specific and in the video it had different bonuses which in game at the moment are different, think they might have changed the raptor with the crow or something... 
---
Sorry for the bad explanation but I think you know what I mean.
---
They'll be slightly slower and less agile + will take a little more damage from BS sized weapons/bombs when not mwding, otherwise... No change.
---
The way anoms work in Eve is nonsensical. if I were a pirate cartel, lets say Guristas or Blood Cartel for example, and I found some "pastures" and was doing my thing, and someone came and slaughtered all my guys, sure I would send some more and possibly more powerful guys to take them out. But after X failed attempts, when it becomes painfully clear that all I'm doing is sending them all to slaughter repeatedly and the situation is not winnable for me, I would stop sending them there and move the hell away. Really fucking far away to avoid whoever it is that is killing all my guys.
---
The spawn system in Eve Online needs to reflect this. Escalate to a certain degree at first, and to such a degree that it presents an actual challenge to the players, for example like T5 Abyss, that sort of AI and reinforcements at the top tier. Last time CCP gave out info on this which was at the 2018 Eve vegas, they said their target number for T5 losses is around 10% give or take a bit. Why can't they impliment PvE adequate in the top tier anoms that provides the same total losses ? And T5 Abyss is a very fair comparison since the ships + pods that run it are often as high as 4-5 Bil in costs. In comparison a regular ratting carrier is 1.3 - 1.6 Bil.
---
As an added bonus, this sort of challenging PvE encounters are difficult to bot, you see some bots in T1 and very very few in T2 Abyss, but pass that they disappear due to the PvE itself and how it works. So this would have a pretty big positive impact on botting and would help a lot from this stand point as well.
---
Lets say you have a 2-3% loss of ratting ships within top upgraded systems due to PvP, so substract that from the 10% of total expected losses and tune the PvE itself to provide the remaining 7% or so.
---
To me it seems much better to introduce mechanics that spread these anoms around, and do so over distance adequate to start presenting a real challenge or simply rebalance it to provide the target loss numbers, over some gimmicky stuff such as local delays etc.
---
Not to say that local delays do not work, they do, we see the undeniable proof every single time on killboards when local goes down. But I feel its not the right way to approach things, like when CCP took away L4s from alphas. I understand why it was done, and the necessity of it, but its really bad and sad to see how many legit alpha players got affected by it. Same principle applies to removing local.
---
So modernizing and updating the game is the way to go that is 100 times better then removing features affecting too many legit players. Though it is of course more work, but it has to be done sometimes anyways, time only goes forward and the game only gets older, this can not be ignored forever, sooner or later it will have to be addressed in an appropriate and major way not just silly stuff like adjusting respawn timers.
---
Tbh Goons are doing good because they/we are good at adapting to changing metas and have always been. Ratting and mining anoms could be removed during DT \_today\_ and we'd still be fine.  
---
I like to think the wardec corp playstyle transcends inducing nerd rage and is just straight up bad for the game. There's a reason why every now and then when an \_obvious\_ noob gets killed somewhere, people will throw that person isk and some advice. We need those people to populate the game and the wardec corps are known to and have been proven to repel players.  
---
Thanks for a constructive back&amp;forth about this in any case; we could have gone down the road of calling each other retard, as is tradition on /r/eve but managed to dodge that bullet

Brain damage

Buy it, lose it, rage, laugh, do it all again.

There is.  The regroup command.

Even 30seconds delay would be enough to shake it up a little.

I mean, just gun your astra and let the fighters rape the ravens, they can't tank a citadel without logi
---
fair enough. i sold at 4.1 myself
---
T1 BCs are dope. 
---
Hell yea, come back and you’ll have a blast. 
---
you could use a mix of Armor T1(or navy) ship to look like a real WH armor brawl fleet. You also can ad some T1 BS (arma is good in fleet)
---
https://zkillboard.com/related/31000382/201903192100/

It can be realy efficient and you can win the isk war easily.

If you face a stronger comp (more number, T2/T3/leshak etc...) don't mind to ask to you enemis to size down for fight a small crew of T1 ships. They 'll come back in freg/destro fleet or some nano kite
---
Vertical image, please. Wallpaper for phone.
---
I think it's not a coincidence that most of the coalition either left the region or switched sides to join us in playing keep away.
---
TRC (literally a group of guys predominantly from yulai and care factor) had a rough time working with cva et al if you ever took the time to listen to the headaches they had to deal with. And found HTP and our band of swarthy heros to be much easier to work with, far more profitable and actually safer than working in the meat grinder for EQ and his crew of neckbeard ne'er-do-wells. What has been impressive to me is that these guys have been transforming from the standard provi carebear into one of the most consistently dangerous groups in the region.
---
(see providence kill board https://zkillboard.com/region/10000047/)
---
What's amazing is how much shit talk used to come out of -7- and CVA against these guys when they were actually in provibloc itself when in care factor and yulai, and the shit talk (looking at you aedun and cj) is still there but if you look at the actual stats cva and -7- are actually being outperfomed by TRC consistently on the providence killboards.
---
So TLDR if your interested in actually seeing real change in provi, hit me up.
---
If you can afford to buy 2, fully fitted and ready to go and still have spare ISK then the answer is yes :)
---
But perhaps they didn't know the exact count of people they'd face. 
---
I wish we would hear these kinds of stories more often.
---
And 50 man domi fleet for HS Industrial corps is a lot of ships damn
---
So... Have you ever heard about the goon locust fleets mining several constellations empty in one evening?  I bet you wont be happy if they start spreading more. Also your suggestions sound like making sov space worse then any other space. Whats the point on holding it then? Why not going to other means of wealth accumulation then. It sounds good in theory but will have massive downsides for the game as a whole 
---
1: Learn to use hotkeys, The only thing you have to actually click for is locking your targets and launching your fighters.
---
2: I agree, this is complete bullshit the way it currently is.
---
3:No.
---
4: Just learn how to use bombs. They fly 30 KM from where your fighters currently are. If you position your fighters properly it's very easy to bomb those rock havens.
---
Because it would be an unorganized mass full of conflicting information, knee-jerk reactions and grabassery.
---
...just like every other corp. 
---
Calmil to my knowledge has never been too strong in EU tz, back when I was in fw it was heavy ustz. 
---
It depends on your size and who you are picking fights.
---
If you intend to go into known space and piss off random sov holders, then something like a Caracal is great. You can fully fit a T2 RFLM Caracal for 25m. Nano fit it (like 2x BCU, 2x Nano) so you can fast allign, kill tackle and move away. Your ships to attack include any Indy/miners and any fast tackle (cepters/dictors). You can perform the same sort of thing with jackdaws/Talwars too.
---
If you intend to roll into random holes and kill ratting dreads/brawl with the 'owners', you need a minimum dps as they will and can excalate, so consider something more heavy. I don't really have a suggestion for this one, as anything T1 you take will not be fit for purpose, you need small ships that hit above their weight class.
---
The Corpse is bigger than the astero ....
---
Prove it .. as you’re confusing me with someone else dude 🤗 no idea what you’re even talking about now 
---
Id honestly say its closer to 450mil per day of p4 and some unknown amount of p1. And that's with 4 accounts, 12 characters 6 planets each.
---
So with the cycle times the amount pulled up drops by about half every day for the length of the cycle. Since the source of profit is from the actual mining planets, pulling weekly is roughly the same as pulling 2 or 3 times a week on a daily. So doing it weekly is 30-40% of the profits of doing it daily. Also doing it daily, at least for me, helps me not forget to do it, where if I did weekly or 3 day i would forget about it, and honestly makes it feel less of a chore in a weird way. I set my cycle times to 22 hours so they are done and one click away from resetting when i get on, otherwise its another click for each planet to cancel the job.
---
Ita
---
I approve the lowsec gate part
---
You mean look at eve online period everyone has some scum bag botters
---
I'd go with quivers
---
well die on? no, just think that you saying "just resetting everyone" makes no sense to me. if people wanted to be friendly , there is and are options in place. we work with, and give people options as always. You can be reset we do take people of kos, we do also set people blue. I'm not quite sure what exactly the problem is at hand.
---
At the end of the day there is always going to be clicks, and smaller groups, and we always have to determine "where" to base that covers the best ranges of providence/most hostile at the time. 
---
Idk if you know this, but we have been kicked out of providence before , we will most likely get kicked out of providence again. I don't think i'm under any illusion that CVA is goons and we have the might of the largest alliances in eve along side us. However we do fight hard and we do fight stubbornly, so as long as we never give up then i'm sure that we will be just fine.
---
&gt;you’ll have a blast
---
check check. logi is primary, logi is primary

Oh boy, anything Bee related means it relates to Goonswarm! Can we have rule on this subreddit related to Test where anything arbitrary about bees be deleted just like anything arbitrary related to dinosaurs related to Test are deleted?

What are you talking about ?

You know this picture is about the top 1% right ?

lol, you irredeemable romantic

Ye, now its the other way around being heavy EU TZ.  
---
And if we intend to go back anytime soon or at all is more of a question for Sparton. :)
---
You do need flawless connection
---
well people left for lots of reasons, people stayed for others. 
---
Not quite sure what the point comes from.A lot of trash talk on both ends of the street, not that i'm always happy about it. At the end of the day, people choose to do what they want to do. It is a game, so we can only do what we can do.
---
TRC was never on bad terms in regards to want to or even desire for standings, just as always time is something some people don't like to wait for. I actually think they have gotten better in terms of pvp, but it does help that htp and others are there to do alot of the heavier lifting in terms of some things that will skew stats at times. 
---
Just will have to fight until we don't fight anymore i guess. maybe someday we will be freinds 
---
Contact your local blue sprinkles representative

I can tell you never read Mr Rive's guide on tackling in an interceptor.  Lynchpin.
---
I am not so experienced in ratting, just did some 3 months super ratting some years ago and occasionally some carrier ratting on an alt.
---
How do you manage to activate each fighter to a different target, i mean if all fighters are selected (blue circle) and you press F1, all the Fighters fire on the same current target. Is there a way to switch between selected fighters AND selected target with a hotkey ?
---
Fuck the army. They should stop their work to do war in spaceship pixel. More content ig, less fucking war irl.
---
I'd be an amazing friend :)
---
I've been pretty happy with the action too back and forth, though it's a shame when the 3rd parties show up but it's the nature of the game I suppose.
---
Is this an Army joke aeronautix, or are you making a political stand here? Here, as in here, a reddit post about a hat and sticky note. This is where you just can't take it anymore and have to flex your opinions about irl war and politics.
---
you're very smart
---
Technically they would drop. More supply an all.
---
warlording in a fax is the most fun you can have in bigger fights IMO
---
This is a reddit post about a hat and a sticky note. It's a super serious place to talk about your view on politics. Please continue, we are all waiting with excitement.
---
delete this
---
&gt; locust fleets 
---
In fact, this development is actually great. 
---
Balancing game like this would be much more than just "shaking things up".
---
How are you going to blue up with your neighbours if you want to take away their stuff? This will lead to more realistic politics, you wouldn't like to border your neighbours. 
---
At some point it will be simply more efficient to split up as limited resources won't sustain megablobs, leading to influx of players back to lowsec and wormholes. Places mostly dead nowdays because everyone in packed in nullsec.
---
As for nullsec, it was supposed to be dangerous. Sure, krabs would hate this change a lot, but in the end of the day, with increased prices for resources, they will increase their income. There is a reason why battleship sized modules costs less than cruisers, right? Remaining ones are botters, who would get hurt the most.
---
As for mining, imagine minerals actually worth something to fight for? 
---
&gt; modify bomb deployment so fighter bombers actually bomb selected area
---
Never had problems with this part, there is a way to have your FB at bombing optimal (30km) instantly after MJDing and the bombing HUD for fighters is quite intuitive in my view (you need tactical overlay for sure).
---
Shout out to the balls on that fucking Keres pilot because bringing only 1 of those against a fleet of that size is begging to be alpha'd. 
---
In fights that big just bring a celestis. You can damp out to 130k and not have to hover in range of everything. 
---
Please good sir, I want to know
---
How is it you have the best Nation in your Reddit username pls
---
Spicy 
---
As a trans woman who's been interacting with this community for years now, I can definitely say that I am not alone in thinking that you really need to HTFU. 
---
If the worst thing you can find in this game to be offended by is a memey username where you specifically look up the sixth definition in urban dictionary to even find one that says it's offensive, this game is not for you as you're just looking to be offended, and people will make you offended.
---
So I think I speak for everyone when I say HTFU  or leave the game, nothing of value was lost
---
Is it hard to find?
---
With the occasional shield bus for extra flavor 
---
Are these time limited skins or staying in shop? 
---
the real reason why you won't celebrate is because everything you do is actually goons right? 
---
Well who will engage you when there is a massive supercap fleet on standby for such operations? Entities like goonswarm are great at logistics, thats why they are so strong. Every nerf we dont look at how it will hurt us but how it hurts our enemies. As long as everyone else gets fucked more its a buff for us.
---
Pregnancy Test Please Ignore
---
literally no plex is traded in ttt
---
Waiting for the scam post.
---
The only thing they changed with the raptor is that it isnt nullified anymore which is a big deal an renders combat interceptors useless. Assault frigates are just better now in every way. And yeah its minor changes on hull. The Best advice i can give you is to buy 10-20 ships of a specific kind you like and just learn by doing. Use t1 frigates with fits that arent more then 10m each so you dont lose excessive amounts of isk learning 
---
i don't speak bot
---
They redesigned interceptors to make the "combat" interceptor that is supposed to be tougher and the "fleet" interceptor that is supposed to be faster. Then more recently they made it so that the "combat" ones don't have nullification and the "fleet ones do.
---
Why, the trade amount on TTT compared to Jita 4-4 is laughable?
---
Also the old ICY markets had much higher volumes as they appeared much more reputable.
---
If you need a safe space then start rorqual botting in delve 
---
But what does it mean?
---
Remember a kspace exit is not the end!
---
You can always find other wormhole in kspace leading to hi sec (or to another wh that lead to kspace)
---
It worth a scan 
---
While I personally don't think that words in a vacuum can do much harm, having that many clearly race baiting, bigotry filled names in the game is just a bad look for the community. The whole post could've just been summarized with "Hey CCP there's some bad names out there maybe you could spend some more time and get rid of them", instead it ended up being some whining by the OP and gamerbros coming out of the woodwork shouting about muh SJW's trying to take my freedom REEE. Falcon's post was just sad to read. Instead of just thinking about the issue he went ahead and argued with points that were basically "If we start banning people with names like 'nagger killer' then we'll have to ban corps like "sniggerdly" or any other name that starts with N or has double G in it.
---
This is actually good for Plex. 
---
I've heard good things, the man is infamous (for various things...).
---
Once you get the basic feel for the game, make multiple characters and “specialize” them. I’ve got a combat/explorer char with scanning and cloaks and bombers and what not. Then I have another character to basically just mine on. The way skills train you invest a lot of idle time if you’re trying to have one character learn it all. Plus, you might like mining on one side of space but like exploring wormholes, which can take you all over the map. So say you come out of a hole 50 jumps from your home station and don’t feel like doing that journey, you can dock, get on another character and be at home. 
---
For a beginner though, join a Corp if you plan on pvping a lot. Some run small fleets some run massive fleets, but friends are always good to have in combat. 
---
If you’re more of a solo player like myself, get into exploration. You can make a ton of cash with exploration in null/wormhole space. And once you train up skills you can sit cloaked 90% of the time unless you’re jumping or cracking a can. 
---
And yea, if you plan on getting into wormhole life, bookmarks and trip wire are your best friends. Unlike high/low/null sec, wormholes don’t have set gates and locations. So you have to map your way in and out of every one. But it’s a good time knowing you could be alone in a hole or have 100 other people in it, that’s what keeps me coming back to them. 
---
Just silly trashy code i wrote that implied it makes the user donate 5m isk if they open my bio lol
---
I'm a small fry, but I just wanted to point that at the very least my monthly 30 bil or so isnt "nothing" but is close.
---
Fucking SnakeCase
---
Do you have data?
---
Anyone got a boson ? 
---
30b is nothing when we're talking about the forge plex market
---
That was the intent of that statement, to point that out.
---
How much space goons accommodate nowadays? How much would they need in order to sustain themselves if their income is suddenly 50% (less ore on belts due to drone mining efficiency, not isk/hour nerf) and resources are limited? And mining operations have to be performed in hostile space? 
---
With changes above, it will require all surrounding regions to be under control by either way puppet coalitions or by themselves. Sounds good? Interesting? Right.
---
&gt; who will engage you 
---
People will be forced to engage or leave for less populated areas. This will hurt renters who won't be able to pay another gang to stay. 
---
&gt; massive supercap fleet 
---
Not so massive if you try to cover 5 regions or if umbrella follows mining fleet and home region is vulnerable. Not to mention that many krabs would simply leave for less hassle.
---
in a BS you'll be dropped as soon as somebody will spot you. Frigates and Cruisers or Battlecruisers are much more fun in solo/small gang pvp
---
I literally just said that, but mathematically, it is nothing. Engineer at the controls says its nothing, little green math man locked in the back corner of my brain is sobbing though.
---
We had that two boosh setup real nicely to get a few guardians. Prolly the best boosh I've ever seen. For those wondering, we booshed, then had another boosher spool up 2 seconds or so after that, and after the first one we were right on top of the guardians, then booshed again and got 3 maybe 4 of them.
---
Yeah they still have long align times, get primaried first, do not get on kills and are blamed if things go wrong. As fun as ever.
---
better than the init pilot who forgot to pick up their drones along with their mobile depot
---
I also would like to see your data, at least I have my personal market data to make claims. I'd also like to see the data that someone was saying jita 4 4 did more trading than TTT.

Keep your fighter UI and normal UI appart (obviously). Rebind next/previous target to some keys ( I use Z and C). Switch between targets with those keys and press F1. In a super you need exactly 3 volleys to kill a battleship so no need to manually click those. You just have to click the small fighters once per ship you attack. barely any mouse movement and click intensity. Orbitting can be done with Q+click.  
---
You can also make an overview to only show NPC's then ctrl+drag a field over the cluster of NPC's to lock them all at once.

If little stuff tries to hold you down, you kill it. 
---
If anything just points you, even if it’s a group, just moonwalk out. 
---
Your weaknesses are blobs, HICs, heavy tackle, and groups with enough logi hold up a heavy tackler. 
---
Oï.
---
If you are new with solo PVP, maybe you should try a cruiser first, because it's easier to escape gate camps.
---
Also, a long point / mwd fit is a good way to start roaming solo since you can control range and gtfo when fleet lands on your grid.
---
Let me guess, you mine in high sec a lot?
---
solo pvp is dead.  if you saw few recent "cool" videos about soloing BS, - that players probably had:
---
alts for scouting, boosting ect
---
awareness about who exactly lives here and cannot drop them
---
"new" char with empty KB , so it would look juicy as a target 
---
if you will undock 10 bs for solo pvp, 9 of 10 will be dropped\\instakilled by fleet. 10th will die because of boredom and no fights
---
You heard about hackmud?
---
Adapt or die leaves out the third option: quit. And a lot of players take that choice at some point in their careers.
---
k
---
that's how you know you're doing a good job :) 
---
At this level of spin, anything that isn't the official goon line is enemy spin. 
---
Holy Cow!  Not only did I leave that there when I saw your hat, I didn’t expect to see a Reddit post about it!  Proof you say?  The chow hall was serving baked orange chicken, corned beef, and oven fried potato slices.  I just got here to NASSIG...
---
He is right actually, are you always this moronic or just having a bad day?
---
Yep. That's what was being served. I'm glad you found this, I was hoping you would. Sent you a dm.
---
CCP wants to nerf supercarries and carriers because they earn too much bounty and told us the PLEX's price grows so high because capsuleers have too much isk. I can not understand than why PLEX's price grows when all other stuff became cheaper and cheaper? I mean citadels, bs, faction stuff, loot etc. If there would be a real inflation in the game market because they situation when capsuleers would have really too much isk, than all other stuff would became more expensive, cos capsuleers when they really have too much money they buy not plex only, but fraction buttleships, modules, structures and other stuff. Who can explain the situation? Is this an inflation or PLEX price is artificially raised?
---
reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
Battleships have a very high chance to get dropped on by carriers, so you need to be good at flying it in order to survive out there... if you don't want to start with at least a BC, you might want to consider flying some t1 BS first; maybe something like a Geddon or  a Typhoon? idk, I don't fly BSs, just pick something cheaper and less tempting to drop
---
Anyway, always fit a MJD and learn how to use it to gtfo from nasty situations, don't even fly a solo BS without one.
---
You are completely right in everything you say but downvoted because it’s Reddit. 1v1 at a beacon in scram range gets old fast. But to be fair eve is not a game where you could really balance 1v1 without hard Rock Paper Scissors effects. The beacon mechanic of fw just exacerbates the problems by creating this dumb ab only meta. 
---
You fool
---
Nothing can beat a noobship with T1 analyzer!
---
*buzzing intensifies*
---
It's where I got into Eve. Playing WoW in the smoke pit, dude asks if I heard of eve. We YouTube it. I downloaded it. 10 years later I'm still here.
---
if you really think 200m isk per hour before lp is a particular high amount for HS HQ sites.... holy fuck my dude thats actually lowballing for a good dedicated and selective group.
---
Before the links changes (yes that long ago,nlike I said didnt run in recent times) 270ish was common, 300 possible with some tcrc luck and a good comp and fc and during the occasional grief contest phase we topped even that.
---
I know that those times wont come back but holy shit have some standards. a reliable 200 is the minimum amount to get me interested.
---
Join a group of pvpers and supply fitted ships, you can get pretty decent margins
---
pocari sweat has a shit name but damn its some good shit
---
More and more veterans trying to plex accounts they previously paid for or adding more and more alts. All while very very few new players join and even fewer actually buy plex to sell for isk. 
---
All those alt accounts and extra rorq alts don’t consume more structures or loot and if anything actually provide more supply of things to the economy. Prices go down on other things and the price for plex steadily increases as it has since the beginning of time. 
---
HTFU, you SJW snowflake soyboy.  &lt;---- notice, no hostility toward your ethnicity.
---
CSM made some pretty good shit happen this year. Id rather have a goos aar from HS than NS some times.
---
Thank you.

If ur vexor hull doesn't have this or a police skin I don't even know why u bother

adding unnecessary micromanagement to prevent afk gameplay is dogshit game design

---
no grapple on bhaal pls, 2 webs.
---
Shut the fuck up.
---
Ah I didn't realize when people complained about small scale pvp dying they were talking about bashing hisec citadels through wardecs.
---
......stfu
---
See you at burn jita. Make sure to be there.
---
Oh I love when big ships pass by our space, so easy to catch and bang specially when you double web them and they’re not going anywhere but in our Killmail hehe
---
How about dont lose your freighter during burn jita, matter of fact dont fly freighter during burn jita at all.
---
How much does it cost? CCP has a bad habit of shooting themselves in the foot and when it comes to pricing. 
---
I'd suggest you try something cheaper before jumping to a bhaal, because rest assured: you WILL lose it to some stupid - in hindsight - error. 
---
For solo pvp, and if you want to do amarr battleships, I suggest you have a look at the geddon: admittedly, it doesn't use lasers and you'll probably need some missile skills, but at least it shares the neut thing with the bhaal (kinda). Other than that, the 2 best t1 bs to solo pvp with are the tempest and the hyperion imo, also typhoon is not bad. T2 guns, unlike in pve, help of course, but are not anywhere needed to start off. 
---
Good luck!
---
Not how it works....
---
Ok
---
You really don't. It can be played on a shitty one
---
Both Risk AND Effort went down significantly over the recent years with CCP only recently starting to acknowledge that fact and beginning to adjust the Reward -side of the equation. Effort specifically went down drastically with the introduction of citadels and the overall goal of making sov-null more and more self-sufficient.
---
So what you're saying is that Frat has already figured out how to incorporate this into your bot scripts?
---
..It looks like one of those blue head-shield things from the old character ports
---
Thanks 😁
---
I still have some training to do in projectile turrets and Minmatar battleships to fly a Tempest, and Hyperion does not interest me the least. Typhoon is a nice ship, but eh, I hate missiles.
---
That geddon looks nice tho 
---
THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE

Um, you should know though, my corp joined Pandemic Horde while I've been on deployment.   
---
You can delete your post if you need to.
---
Nothing more thrilling than surviving being primaried, that sea of red yellow boxes, the purple of your own logi, getting volleyed into structure. It’s better than heroin.
---
also its t1... you can fly it as alpha and/or very little skills
---
Also your guns orientation isn't affected by your ships orientation, which is one of the most annoying and ridiculous quirks of EVE's "physics", allowing you for example to mitigate damage from heavy drones by reducing your velocity to 0m/s.
---
NO, THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE, KIND WARRIOR OF OURS
---
I WISH I COULD SHAKE YOUR HAND IRL, YOU ARE A TRUE HERO
---
He's not wrong though.

Don’t not connect Stain to lowsec

Tenla. She never really leaves the Amarr system, but I keep an eye out for her. She's just a really chill person imo.

No, just obnoxious like most goons here.

it's about this time he usually comes back to eve, drops a couple hundo on plex and donates it to the gankres

**HOLD ON**! Are you saying the wardeccing mechanic was used to... generate... content? Impossible! 
---
Exactly, the trend should continue, i see 5M as a soft ceiling, but there is no guarantee it will last.
---
i've been playing since 2008. after two weeks of missions in high-sec i've moved to non-sov null for pvp, last 4(5) years i live in low solo (1 acc). meanwhile i play few months a a year at best

Oof

Not really, this is just someone testing the water temperature. :)

My cloaky eyes in the other side of the gate I'm camping. If I spot her I know that local is bugged again.
---
haha what the hell
---
 I was using the old plex prices my bad (1plex = 1.5 b) 
---
Imma say people are gonna drop carriers faster than a fucking hot potato. You will die to carriers like a bitch, and a dread insures better (tho that may be changing with the new updates to insurance) and gets more tank and dps. That being said, anyone with the balls to solo pvp in a faction BS has my undying respect, though you may want to use a cheaper ship that is flown the same as a bhaal. (Geddon is the first thing that springs to mind, insures good and is like 1/5 cost of bhaal, plus it also uses large energy guns armor and neuts)
---
Amarr wouldn't be Amarr without Tenla =) 
---
&gt;!it looks like the last walking dead episode!&lt;
---
Well, I beg to differ. The game does not tolerate lossy connections and drops, sockets closed are imminent. 
---
Unless they applied some core change I haven't heard of.
---
One can argue that the ostensible american thanking-for-service is a political stand about irl war and politics, especially in places like a international game subreddit.

100% recommend this event. I've only been fortunate enough to go once but I've sent a bunch of people over and everyone has had a lot of fun. I had a blast and the level of care the organizers put into the details of taking care of people was really cool :).

I suppose that depends on your definition of shitty.

Ping spikes to 200-500ms and anywhere from 1-20mbs and loss of up to 1-2% i would consider shitty.

We hold every Region around delve. Fontain, querious, period basis. Partial control over pure blind. Also we have a fully operational shield and armor superfleet each capable of outnumbering any single entity in the game. I think if every other big nullsec block in eve bands together then we would be on an equal level still. You dont want to mess with the Imperium 
---
nice story

If new to solo get in at frigate level. The reaction times developed wrt module management will pay dividends as you scale up

If you see MasL in local, it's already to late. You need to see his cyno hunter

About 8 years ago this dude flew a snaked out hurricane every night in EC-P8R and killed us while we were gstecamping.  I think we only caught him once, and I still remember the name.
---
Do you use one or two extractors per planet? Or do you always do p0-p2? 
---
To add to this idea of a war, you could also argue that after so much killing of npcs, they decided rigs And in an elite task force. Diamond rats specifically. These diamond rats start showing up at military index 4 or 5vand the more npcs you kill, the more they show up. Instead of just sticking to mining fleets, they warp around to the havens and sanctums as well. They shoot structures, and in general, disrupt the system like you said. Imagine delve. Everywhere would have diamond rats
---
Thats what I'm thinking lol...

Jump in, hold E click anchor, hold drone hotkey click drone guy, tab back to rorquals and PVP!!

This is good advice. Maybe welp 5 geddons then jump in a bhaal

Make fighters behave "smart" if NSA is running :D

Good reason for people to still mount NSA after the changes.

For me is always - select target, angle ... and they drop bombs to early so don't hit any thing.     But i don't rat so not to much practice.

Not trying to make a political stand, or infer any politics. Just saluting someone who has volunteered to potentially put their lives on the line to protect their country.

"They brought 5 Ravens. We had 52 Domis." Plz tell me you only used ecm drones to perma jam them into giving up!
---
Fucking Canadians. /sigh
---
Which has me curious to see their new ships coming up.
---
Yup, you’re with the many guys that are pointing me toward a nice Geddon, and it’s not like T1 battleships are the hardest to build or find, so I’ll always have a supply so long that I have access to a market (and the ISK) :)
---
Now, I just need to get a fit for the Geddon. Someone told me that a T1 battleship NEED an MJD to position itself, with a mix of webs, grapplers and scrams to hold whatever smol shit is holding me in place from close range. I guess Mega pulse lasers with scorch are interesting in that option, but I’d need some modules or rigs dedicated to the range of the turrets.
---
Then, the highs can get multiple heavy neuts, just to fuck with the capacitor of smaller ships, maybe a Drone Link for comfort (don’t know if I should use a full heavy flight, sentries or a mixed one). Low would be an active armor tanks with high resists, and if I have a free low slot, either a DDA or Heat Sink to top off the DPS.
---
Thanks for the help man :)

It would be helpful if some people could put together a cohesive plan of changes that could make FW better.  I think CCP would be receptive to that.  Lowsec used to be a fun place to fly inexpensive ships and small gangs around.

You will want to stay away from the stream then as well.

I played for 8, still had to ask people how to do things on the regular. Keep in mind, with so much freedom, there are nearly infinate ways to do something wrong, and comparatively few ways to do it well. Asking people to mentor you in some skill is a way of Eve life.
---
Last I heard of Xer0/Tsubaru he'd got a job payimg 6 figures at apple in the middle of the iphone boom. Hasnt logged into eve since afaik, wonder what hes up to these daya

We know plex inflates but this type of spike is pretty uncommon. over 10% increase in a month is a LOT. Any reason at all for this sudden increase?

How do they verify though, is it an honors system and posers are quickly found out thru convos/stories?

Or do they actually ask for a dd214 or a CAC scan lol

Please don't tell me you're still in that pet alliance? 
---
I would participate but I have no idea how to improve factional warfare.  60% of my angst or more was due to boredom of plexing sites. 
---
As the residents in question, thanks to literally everyone involved on both sides, for delicious snatch tactics, to 72 hours of "will my fort die/won't my fort die", a lot of talking to everyone on all sides, to that final fleet combat where a relative amount of isk many not have been lost by comparison, but the amount of blood spilled on both sides was ferocious!

Good for you.  Before Gate Tax Collection became part of PIRAT they wardec'd a bunch of us carebears in Jerma (Ice mining).  I coordinated 5 other wardec'd corps and we took out their large tower/guns/etc then locked them into Jita.  Everytime they undocked we got them into low armor.  Kept them there for hours.. Felt good.    
---
Would have been the perfect story but a corp mate alpha'd me off the field on accident but I don't like like to talk about it.  Led to a good discussion on overviews though.

Im doing some "solo" nightmare and it means scout in ceptor to catch something and spawn a noobspwan or just to check if there is no 100 frigs on other side. Also i have a scaning alt with remot repairs so i can put my Hull and armor back. And after wepling my nightmare with 500 killmarks i decied to bring hauler with capboosters. So ye my "solo" pvp looks like this. Its also most of The Time boring coz im doing shitloads of.jumps coz most of eve is empty. U need strike fast and Run away coz every1 will try drop Carriers or super on u.
---
U need also check their killboards to see how they escalte. Solo bs looks cool but to have resault u need alot of work. But when u do it all. Its amazing.
---
Learn one ship, and alllways do research of The region u want to hunt.
---
and the nestor
---
I believe if you hear malador talk about it in a video but he also went over to the Chinese server with other rooks n kings
---
Yeah, but that ain’t solo. Plus I have a bloody hate to alts when it comes to PVP, so that’s not for me I suppose.
---
Porn maker and his alts

Yes I can agree with you on that.

Try to put yourself in their shoes. You just lost a fight with one of the strongest comps you can bring to a non-pulsar wormhole, heavy armor brawl with Leshaks, Bhaals, Guardians, etc.  
---
You're facing a very skilled opponent who is fielding the pinacle of wormhole pvp comps and is most likely fitted purple+ to the max.  
---
And you're in a hurry and run out of options because you might not come up with a super niche comp to counter your opponent nor do you have it available.
---
Why would you give up on such an offer?
---
Most of us know the term "Don't fly what you can't afford to loose." or "What ever you undock is already lost." - "What goes into a wormhole doesn't come out alive."
---
Seeing Lumio's name always brings a smile to my face.  I saw him the other day in HS of all places.

Why are they unlimited?

Then its hard to have a good kill ratio, solo bs is a super nice to kill. Start with cruzier or bc.

Bjorn’s main, also squishy (because I’m a big fan of theirs). Other than that, darilius is a fucking badass that flies a venture for pvp, I try to give him a solo fight when he’s out in catch.

---
Just recognized it lately, if you select the fighter and unselect the ship (no blue circle on ship HUD) you can set orbit/kep-at-range distances for the fighters in "selected items" window. If you than have selected all fighters with blue circle you can press orbit hotkey and click on the gate (haven). Then your fighters will orbit in the range you assigned.

Have you actually experienced a heroin rush?
---
I am so close to unsubscribing from EVE. Don't have anything major against CCP but they are way too out of line even when they are joking or whatever. They are so toxic and arrogant that it brought questions for me, one of them is why do wormhole corps keep playing this game? CCP devs are probably even worse in real life. Just way too annoying. And then it occurred to me. Wormholers just hate their lives. Yeah we got the HIC nerf and they introduced a way to actually roll the holes, but we've suffered plenty along the way to getting there. CCP changed over time, for worse. They can be rude to other people as well in many of their reddit and forum posts, being rude to solo players and smallgangers included. The truth sucks so much but ever since CCP started only looking at large nullsec alliances, wormhole life went to shit. I hate to say this but i want the old and fun solo and smallgang content back. The content that made me want to log in.

Remove NPC bounties.

I'd say more then 5, 50-100 before up shipping. You want to have enough experience flying bs, so you've seen a bunch of different situations and know how to handle them.

The fact you have reg-date in your lexicon speaks volumes about you. Normally I’d suggest you go shave that neck beard and move out of your moms house or that you die in a fire. But instead I’m hoping you stay sucking on the rotting tit that eve has become. 
---
Something along those lines but I'd ike to be able to look at a region map and see some sort of measurement for NPC kill consistency using the drop down. a sort of combination of average delta and number of kills 24/48H the more a system is consistent in percent of rats killed per hour over 48 hours, the closer to red it gets. 
---
I don't know exactly what I want but something along those lines.
---
TEST were never great, I think you are just wishfully thinking, the video never existed.

How is your own ethnicity relevant in this case? Allegedly the term is derogatory towards native Americans, not African Americans.

I have 4, 1 bil orthruses with 4 bil snake pods that I kill T1 frigates in. I don't get what the big deal with people complaining about jaguars is, just scram them lmao.
---
ok so i stand corrected,   snake pods...eh i dont much care.  
---
but 1b orthruses are always fun. and 4 of em.  hope your in a small weapon dmg wormhole, abuse rapid lights.

Since I'm not a miner or much of a ratter, it means jumping into a PvP subcap to pick off a few of his command destroyers. Not easy, but certainly fun.

Lists? Lol id wager a lot of us would be interested in where to find some PC players to harass. Altho they would probably ticket ccp for giefing or someshit
---
He hasn't caught me yet but https://zkillboard.com/character/92641678/  or one of his multitude of alts from cloud templars. Mostly dangerous because his perma-camping makes people complacent, thinking he's not active and then lose their ships.

depending on how far youd consider the area, we moved the large multi-day event to NY. I couldn't find a venue to keep it in NH.

We had to move it out of state, couldnt find a new venue when we lost that one.

exactly, it's just a prime example of a whiny wormholer btw. 
---
I was in high flyers when they killed him (the km you linked), if I recall correctly he’d DC’d with aggro and that was how he got caught - pretty sure they podded him too.
---
Could this be offset by using a faction or dead space AB?  Pretty sure the difference between an alpha and omega pilot in a PvP frigate battle is around 5% or so (speed/dps/tank).
---
fuck you nazi
---
TRC was jerked around. We were told we needed to do X to get standings. We did X, along with going generally above &amp; beyond from the perspective of many, not just ours. Many of the provi FCs at the time were also confused as to why we didn't get standings since we went on every fleet we could. (By the way equi, its really hard to get people to meet a minimum number of kills defending provi when you make it harder for them to get into fleets) Yet after the time period came up, when we applied for standings, we were told we didn't do good enough. Funny enough the requirements changed after we put in our application...  
---
Anyways, I could go on &amp; on.... but it is history that has been written already.  
---
In the end, CVA made us feel very under appreciated, and entirely unwanted. So we decided to set on a new venture. The intent when we left wasn't to end up where we are now. But along the road we made some new friends (the best we've had) and have ended up in a much better place than expected.   
---
So maybe I should be thanking CVA for shitting on us &amp; jerking us around 2 years ago. If they hadn't made us want to leave, we wouldn't be where we are today: growing, learning, having fun with friends, and always working towards being better.

Training queue showing empty. Known issue, or are CCP's servers having issues right now? I did see a "RIP Login Servers" post, so wouldn't be surprised if there are issues.

That was already done though, the #newfw channel even produced a document...

Felicia Nethers, Stitch K, and Rist. If I see them in local, I know I'm about to get a great 1-on-1 fight and I'm about to die.
---
I agree.  Flying a super is a giant pain in the butt.  It's really, really high maintenance.  After our last deployment I vowed never to take a super into battle ever again.  
---
Apart from anything else you fire ammo that costs 27m a shot. It's quite ridiculous.
---
I was there too, sadly stuck on the otherside of the gate with a bubble ship, Couldnt whore in time :(

cant recall if he Dc'd, maybe just logged cuz he knew he was screwed haha.

This answer also works with literally anything in this game
---
Whenever I mention that I play Eve, i get blank stares.
---
Why Thera specifically?
---
If your Eve career ends up anything like mine then you'll end up  carrier ratting in Null whilst also trying to piece together how you ended up there. The only advice I can offer: don't actually pursue an answer to the question of how you got out there, just keep ratting. 
---
Meiqur friend = best friend &lt;3

lol me too. A few people have asked me what it's like to have spent thousands of dollars on a fake spaceship. I told them those expensive battles they heard about were composed of hundreds of people, unless they were talking about Star Citizen, which I am not a part of.

Remember him from my time in the south. Still have his corps in my inventory lol.

Yeah, many people/companies offer TS3 as a service. Just head on over to google and it'll have lots of recommendations.

can someone blow you pod too?. what happens to your character? does it get erased ?? no this is too hardcore

so Something Special = Tsubaru/Xer0 ?

Im assuming he went to Dyson with wey'oun and the rest of the RnK dudes who ended up in either Lost Obsession or Drunk N Disorderly then? 
---
I might have to hop onto pl og and say hi 
---
1. ehh.....no comment. i see the appeal. but also see the problems....
---
2. agree for this one. make it liek sansha space with perm cyno inhib.  could make it so if you upgrade space to lv 5, the owner can use cynos. experiment with it.
---
3. well people can still gate capitals, so the ehd is questionable if its lower.  but it does need a revamp aye.
---
4. aye, plus soem volitile skins, and a buff to faction ships would help...as right now they hit or miss in terms of appeal vs pirate or eachother (VNI spam. not many go for caracal navy.  though Osprey navy has some fans)
---
5. interesting, but how would they select someone.  or depose them.   galmil had some major issues with leadership infighting, due to some rather large corps.     while Calmil was pretty solid in leadership with 1 top head. but once that head disappears things fell fast.   still its an idea to look into
---
6. agreed agreed agreed.
---
7. again issue is gating caps.  and blocking caps from moving through fw space is a problem.   i agree dps cap should be lower(which ironically hurts caps as their alpha does less and less as it hits the cap),  but should also consider the dmg cap increasing/ehp increasing with the level of the system.
---
all in all, i'd love to see some experimentation with ideas, even if 90% end up bad ideas and get dropped. its at least progress and more than FW has gotten in a long time.  and would be fun to try the experimental ideas
---
If you saw Tank CEO you knew it was a bad time coming
---
FW is already dead, let's kill it more with making it even tougher to live there

Yeah. It's been a while, but I still remember this guy killing my Leopard with a smartbomb.

haha thanks for the compliments to all the women !!!

good cause im not into voice chatting anyways 
---
how do you leave a landmark?? 
---
i like the idea of blowing my ship and selling its resources (metals .. etc) how do i blow it up plus it cost 10k to get another starter ship hopefully it pays iff 
---
I am not sure why people make these post? If you aren't having fun, walk away. You don't have to make a dramatic exit in an attempt to bring others with you. 
---
It is a game. When I stepped away for awhile, I just logged off quietly. Why attempt to spread toxicity around with no proof or content. 
---
People these days are all about drama and stirring the pot. I don't get that attitude of crying for attention. 
---
I'm really surprised to hear both of you say this, I feel like I win the vast majority (90% or more) of my FW fights if 1. My opponent is flying the same class of ship (Faction v Faction say) and 2. I don't get caught by multiple dudes, and I still don't feel like I fly with no mistakes, I see plenty of opportunities to improve my play when I watch recordings.
---
That's an old name. Reminds me of First name Last name.

good lmao. im gonna be dicking around everyone untill all corps hate and annihilate me from the world  lol

Thanks man, I wanted to go on this new adventure, but I miss Init too.

Me too man.
---
Agreement 
---
Ashterothi's Crossfaction podcasts are a gold mine of good ideas of how to improve FW, particularly the Roundtable episode.
---
Honestly, I think this was a well-played troll thread.
---
So you're complaining about sov null being "dead" for small gangs and "blobbing" while you're engaging what you admit are "local superpowers" like Frat with all of *seven* people? Nullsec has never been a place you can challenge strategic objectives of a force several times your size with any success. You're reffing structures in a known conflict region (Scalding Pass) and not expecting a response from locals? 
---
I guess the interesting things about folksy wisdom is people say it differently. 
---
No no, don't you understand, if I can't ref structures in a conflict zone with major superpowers in my elite seven man alliance without getting a response, the game must be dead.
---
Same with me.
---
I don't want to have anything to do with ISK making. Assumng a plex, maybe two a month, what can I do that will be pure pvp, will let me jump into PVP frequently and will NOT incur any logistics nightmares?
---
Is there anything like that available? I have a 100M sp char ready.
---
It could be, but blinging a t1 frigate isn’t very smart, and if you fly a faction frigate then people who engage you on purpose will be using bling as well, or are flying a counter to your ship
---
It's rather polite of him to "allow" goons to operate there.
---
I'm all in favour of improvements to FW and Lowsec in general, is the area of New Eden I enjoy the most and it's in a really sad state... but those are ALL terrible ideas.
---
Protip: you can put an unfitted battleship and its fit/charges/ammo etc into the fleet hangar of a dst.

DST's will fit through a c1 hole.

Never on bad terms? I was literally called a “traitorous cunt” by CVA leadership in an email when my Corp came back to provi to try and help. I was denied the ability to get any clones in Provi and my guys were consistently killed by CVA even though we weren’t KOS.
---
And if we want to talk about skewed stats—I lived in provi for four years. Provi is just as bad as the rest of the blue donut when it comes to null blobbing. 
---
And that is an honorable thing to do. 
---
To put this in perspective; when soldiers returned from WW2, they were treated as heroes. There were parades in their honor. But when people came home from Vietnam, they were spit on, denied jobs, and some even kicked out of their homes. Some soldiers from both wars were drafted. Any idea that the Vietnam war was a mistake, should be directed to the Government who made the decision, not the poor guy being forced into it only because he lives in that country. Is it better to be a coward and flee to another country? I guess it's a lose lose when you get drafted?  
---
Because of this, many people from the Vietnam era have impressed upon their children, and their society, that military members should be thanked for their service, regardless if you agree with the Governments decision about how to use their military. And that is why there are some people who will always thank military members for their service. It's NOT a declaration of "I support all decisions made by my country".  It's more of a statement that military members will not be treated like they were after Vietnam ever again.
---
Fleet/line command is tricky too.
---
Remember, indy Corp. They're not used to fleet operations, watching broadcasts, or logi fleet command.
---
It's pretty easy to tell everyone to throw their RR on whoever is getting shot and drones on the primary.
---
Truth. Preach it buddy.
---
It also says "No Ship Information" for my characters where it displays what Eve system my characters are all located at. I am probably going to clear the android app data and try it as if it were a fresh install.
---
Yes love that but, for rouge drones illed love to see them just get more and more vicious. Untill you have roaming gangs off rouge drones attacking every thing from the hostiles. *Give us a chance to take there side some how *
---
Structures  ships and soon so it's self.
---
I don't believe rouge drones would run just get more an more pissed off untill the system's a war zone * as it should be* or just a death trap. 
---
Give it a wind down so if it get abandoned they slowly go back to normal and you now have space with a lot off personality.
---
Could even have a mother hive that shows up in the higher level off infection. That you could take out. Or defend for rewards, if it does the rouge drones leave the system fully for a time.
---
I'm having these same issues, I reauthed all characters, but did not clear data beforehand (so had the chars with 36 perms, then authed and it showed with 45 perms)
---
Lowsec? Yeah no carriers. Outright supers.

I am a Marxist, 'real' communism does not exist any more than 'real' capitalism exists. Lenin's contribution to both history and political theory is that an alternative to capitalism was possible. People like you proceed to blame the state capitalist 'socialism in one country' style totalitarian Stalinist state on Lenin, when Lenin's literal dying statement was to keep Stalin away from the politburo. 
---
All at the same time ignoring the incalculable death toll of capitalism, either through capitalist state violence (and there is enough to match anything you could blame 'communism' for), and the   18,000,000 people who die a year from systematic poverty, or the 7,000,000 children who die a year from treatable illnesses (because they cannot 'afford' the treatment') or the cost of imperialist wars. 
---
While also posting the death tolls of men like Stalin, which if you actually interrogate the data is heavily inflated... you might as well point to the Holocaust and blame it on 'capitalism' rather than on insane idea of one individual. 
---
All that being said, this all started because people like you, think it is perfectly fine to use slurs *literally* shouted at people being beaten to death because of their sexual orientation are okay to use in EVE, and people taking offense to it 'victims' of left wing political correctness.  
---
So you can straw man me all day to deflect from the fact that you are okay with slurs being used by the prominent members of the eve community; however, at the end of the day, you should not lack the courage of your convictions and just own up to being a bigot. This conversation about Marxism has nothing to do with that. 
---
It's funny because good fight don't mean a lot has to be destroyed ( believe it or not the most fun fights i been in have often been less then a 10 billion destroyed ). 
---
The one that looks best for you. Other considerations come second.
---
Logi is a critical component to any fleet and imo can make or break a fleet. One thing that people are not mentioning is that logi is being looked at currently by the dev team. Right now they are looking into giving remote repair modules a diminishing return. They are doing this because fax ships have proven just too strong in capital warfare.
---
So logi is important and always will be, but there are changes on the horizon. 
---
What you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have  ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent post were you  even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought.  Everyone in r/Eve is now dumber for having listened to it. I award  you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.                              
---
I worked my way up an an Astero by exploring high-sec, which then allowed me to lose it in null sec.. rinse and repeat at least 10-20 times since and now I am a seasoned explorer with blingy ships and I absolutely know how I can be caught and killed when exploring, which in return has allowed me to avoid capture quite well. This IMO is the best way to learn how to keep an Astero. 
---
What about gank. After some time the NPCs put a bounty on you for killing so much. And there elite. "Or maybe an allied factions" come after you. Dread small hit sqauds at Frist. Up to ever full on fleets. *For sub caps* to dread bombs or even super drops, for caps
---
Ty, do you happen to have a link?
---
Can you imagine playing a **M**assive **M**ultiplayer **O**nline game that’s not hyper focused on small gang pvp lmao

Also when and where have you spoken to devs to give you the appeal that they’re all assholes?

Also, ONLY IF YOU CAN FIT A COVERT OPS CLOAK!

From the title this sounded like some AA meeting to help you guys cope with the reality of FW.

Jeebus fuck OP, he flew a 30 bil mac? He'd wanna kill anything and everything!

So far after clearing the app data, I'm trying to load my main and it's just giving the scrolling progress bar. Only loading in my character portrait, all other info is blank. Still not sure if it's the app or ESI acting up.

Depends what you plan on dropping. If you going after tatters than you want to be able to hit into their resistance holes. If your looking for an all around option, panther is very good. If your worried about tanking, your doing it very wrong. Blops are not Brawley ships, they are gank and gtfo ships
---
Sounds like the issues are with the OP, less so with CCP.
---
#SpaceUber
---
Whichever one you like the look of least. That way you won't care as much when it inevitably gets supers dropped on it.
---
And there have been good posts by others. The problem is, if CCP isn't listening, y'all are just debating yourselves to death or yelling within the echo chamber. And they definitely aren't listening otherwise you'd see much more outreach.
---
well not sure who you are in game so i can't comment. if you do have some complaints you can send me msg directly and or evemail if you wish 
---
Also everyone blobs, even in low, even in whs, everywhere. you fight when you think you can win and every once and awhile its even and you win or lose and its a glorious fight. generally speaking that's always the case.
---
HAIL HYDRA
---
Marshal is by far the king for anything that doesnt fit omni tank ( such as Shekelsnakes in drones)
---
If you cant punch through firing into resist holes your gonna need neuts, which is why the Sin is so popular.
---
If you just wanna fuck around and kill random shit, eg solo pvpers or vnis or w/e then a Deemer is good, but they all work for that so pick ur poison.
---
So really, it depends on what you wanna hunt.
---
Ooooo, Eve northeast. Maybe I'll check it out as a Rhode Islander
---
If you do some Sisters of Eve level 4 missions for loyalty points you can get the Astero BPC for only 15m isk or so. The materials to build the Astero only cost like a few hundred thousand isk. Makes it much cheaper to buy. I personally prefer the Astero over the T2 covert ops frigs, the Astero align time is much better and you can get it to a sub 2-second warp.
---
i find this poast wormholer insensitive ;)
---
So does this mean we should all HODL our Plex?

They can ruin your whole day, all right. Especially if you only bring 5 Ravens.

52 rr domis can out rep way more than 5 Ravens worth of damage. On top of that, the damage output of 52 domis is a force to be reckoned with and many fleets not built to take them down would have trouble just staying on the field

Marshal &gt; Sin/Panther &gt; Redeemer &gt; Widow for solo
---
Specialized Marshal-Toons (5.0 secstat) give an insane tank, the tackle bonusses are really handy for solo dropping and you can shoot into resist holes.
---
Sin can fit a decent active Shield-Tank to maximize drone damage  and a full set of Neuts/NOS are deadly for active tanked krab fits.
---
Panther has good DPS, decent active shield tank and 2 Utility Highs for neut pressure on active tanks.
---
Redeemer is the best choice for BO Fleet doctrines as it has the best passive buffertank, high DPS and good projection (Scorch OP)
---
Widow was basically turned into a support BO, the armor tank is shitty, the shield tank negates/diminishes ECM Boni and DPS is only worth mentioning with Torps, where you have shitty application. You take it as utility with bridge and jams that are handy when you have hostile fighters on grid.
---
pod tenla because amarr
---
And a reason to add more space. Picture the gold rush to expand to new areas just so your not pressed up against your enamys as hard. If not it will allow for space where smaller entitys can build them self's up. Big entitys wouldn't move there as there allready dug in
---
just mostly sad youve missed my pvp growth. its really been a journey
---
Not any more :-(
---
No, really, CCP made solo Widow entirely useless with the ECM nerf. No point in jamming a target that can still lock you. 
---
lmao NC fed muninns to RATTLESNAKES

Why is there no import from clipboard option in fittings. It has export but no import.

no standings doesn't equal we shoot you or do not let you operate or do whatever you want to do. Again, you have your perspective and I have mine on the matter, but generally speaking never had any issue with trc until we were being shot at by trc. Have never been one to be as fast as i should be on matters and I do tend to be very pragmatic. That being said i'm sure there is good and bad everywhere, so i try to do better on the good side and do better on reducing the worse. As always you cannot satisfy everyone in everything so will always have some who disagree with decisions and or lack therefore of them as well. I'm sure Jintaan as well as many others have some positives and negatives to say about "me, cva, sov holders, blues, neutrals, enemies. 
---
I don't think I can or change history or rehash it to make it better or worse, it just is. While you think you were done "wrong" that is always going to be the case and I don't think i will change your mind on that.
---
Go with t1 battlecruisers with t1 logi support. Something like Hurricanes. They insure well, they are cheap, they do not require much SP, they're low on mass and they have a wide engagement range. 
---
Then get into beam Confessors with Deacon/Thalia support, for killing stuff through frig holes, ganking stuff in wolf-rayets or third partying on other people's content.

Fl1p, Sapporo, or Corvin. Pretty much know you're about to get dropped if you're doing hood rat shit in their regions if they show up.

/me shrugs.

Yeah I think I will stick with the Sin due to its Neut options. Mind sharing a fit if you have one ?

How did you knew I'm a goon ? :D

I don't think the Widow is useless at all. It's one of the tankiest BLOPs, and Burst Jammer will still get you out of a lot of tough places. If anything the Widow was being crippled before because people felt it necessary to pack the midst with jams. Now you can solo drop it with a get out of jail free card.

So where to Rorqs fit into this story?

Woosh

There was a crashing version I posted yesterday but you should have 20190327 by now (check the about).

Dmn. This will be the first skin I spend PLEX on. And I can't even fly the Ishtar. Time to set up a new skill que.

20190219 as of my reinstall an hour ago. :/

It's a solid utility to have in a small blops fleet
---
Well...I re-tried again....it works on my device (TM).
---
Which Android version do you have?
---
Also wait i didn’t recognize your name. You were the one who called me the traitorous cunt in the first place. So don’t come to me with saying that you never had any issues with us. Your memory is super selective.

"Say it!  SAY IT!"

"...m...a...t...'e."
---
I suggested it awhile ago, but FW plexes that also limit the amount of ships that can enter, instead of the current soft/discouraged limit of having to split LP.
---
Probably balance it out by incorporating ESS mechanics; there's a dictor bubble around the beacon, and the closer you are to the beacon (taking you longer to get out of it, thus more likely to fight) the faster the beacon can flip.
---
That should also keep the core stabbed frigates from running sites, or at least discourage them.
---
Woof!
---
I had no idea high sec had other people in it besides alts anymore

Any time u roam geminate this dude is a massive threat.  He knows how to PvP and he tends to run blinged out ships.
---
Dreddit is recruiting btw
---
I doubt many wormhole players will choose to deploy such a structure as many of us enjoy the lack of local and the risk that comes with it.
---
Not to mention that those who did deploy such a structure would probably find themselves evicted from their hole in short notice
---
&gt; Would have been the perfect story but a corp mate alpha'd me off the field on accident but I don't like like to talk about it.
---
This makes the story so much better tho
---
well not everyones is. i don't assume anything.

Bc cynos in highsec....?

wat?

"Knows how to pvp" might be a bit of an overstatement. Dude just undocks huginns and lokis for frigates and has his finger on w.

Unless you get unlucky and that c1 is a small ship only hole....

So in general Eve is a good game to be a tryhard, but .01 isking is the wrong direction to expand on. You'll inevitably drive yourself crazy, burn out and quit. Your long-term focus needs to be on **isk:effort** ratios, which means higher-value flips and speculation; finding a way to spend 10 minutes or less buying something expensive that you'll make a 30% return on. 
---
Globby is actually the sort of high-profile capitalist you should be learning from - he perfected [a way to make very good isk/hr with minimal risk to himself and low starting capital.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/9i6s4q/hello_im_erotic_trade_and_im_the_reason_ccp_added/) It's unorthodox, which is ideal (doing the same thing as 50 other traders &amp; bots will have you compete your wages down to like 5m/hr, you wanna be a special snowflake); it's also sadly been patched out, but you can get in on [his other gimmick](https://zkillboard.com/kill/54268452/) if you want some fast capital injections. Lmk if you need solo fits.

I feel like it's normal(I'd say "easy" rather than normal) to win a majority of your fights in 1v1 frigate because you can choose your fights at will. You can choose to never enter a losing fight. Based on your ship, you can see what ship you can kill and which ship think they're going to kill your ship. It's kinda all about meta at this point. They think they can kill your ship because the meta fit for your ship is a brawler so you get a winning fight if you bring some kind of kite instead. Similary, they think they have the range control so they pick a fight with you, but you've got speed implants, so you win.
---
You just can't get caught so there's no reason to pick a losing fight, except when you're dead bored by the lack of fights. Of course there's all the play about annoying someone until they miss their warp-in and stuff but yeah
---
You can lose a loooot of ships for 4 billion isk a month fam.
---
X-Feanor
---
That song finally made sense after meeting his clown. Who would've guessed 'it' was phat loot?
---
Suprise mothergneisser
---
Maybe I should re-phrase that, limit the amount of ships that can enter from either militia. Gal+Min can only send in X ships and Cal+Amarr can only send in X ships.
---
"Don't use metered networks" is not checked. I am on cellular right now, I can try again on wifi when I get home, but I have not had issues with Evanova on T-Mobile in the past. I'll update after I get home..

You can tell if you're in wormhole space by looking at the current system (it'll be like J123456)

Truthfully I wouldn't know. According to the wiki article it's only found in a few locations around the globe and North Carolina is one of them.
---
Well wasn't sure that your eve name was the same as your reddit one, not often is. (i suppose if you have eve only account then i can understand that). 
---
That was the whole YF issues that were never really settled and still probably to this day have alot of festering issues (which is ofc why some have some issues with it).
---
Anyways, that is correct, I did have issues with YF but thats not along the same time frame as the TRC before they were red to cva, which was a different timeline (infact they were red /had been red for some time before YF left provi and you came back).
---
which was the general timeline where i said i never had an issues before with TRC. I know you don't think you did anything wrong in leaving, during the invasion but others do. 
---
Anyways several different issues and several different timelines involved here.
---
That's not the init narrative though :P
---
US and EU don't have that large of a base in FRT yet.
---
Weird a buddy of mine and I were out fucking around in two cruisers and he was able to get ahold of one of us.
---
&gt; I am so close to unsubscribing from EVE 
---
So just do it or don't it's your free time to spend on your hobbies, and if they are not fun, change it! 
---
How did I know this was going to link to that one RnK WH video?  Great video/fight though, back when Eve was a much bigger place.
---
I have experienced an opiate high, but not heroin.  You can feel the warmth spreading through your veins.  Its a bizzare sensation but feels incredibly soothing.
---
Yes.  
---
All with the same common thread: CVA turned away good people, and many of them have coalesced into TRC. 
---
I'll tell mittani to order 10 cases to the gaming house
---
Yes different timelines, but the theme is the same: if you treat people like shit then they aren’t inclined to keep fighting for you. 
---
No, it was there. I was very disappointed as I wanted it to climb a lot higher and do not appreciate him messing with the economy. 
---
I also do not know why its gone now. Did it all get bought out and spread through different markets and players holding onto it or did he yank it off the market after a couple days ? If he did yank it, then why ?
---
well i do remember some people, but can't remember everyone who has ever shit talked or talked shit to no. that would probably be a long long list to remember. and once he told me who he was it was easy to look up what happened and why and when. i'm not making an excuse for not knowing everyone personally even if people know me.
---
1. Not being able to use JF's in FW would be a serious pain. I'd rather not have FW become even more tedious.
---
2. I don't think cynojamming all of FW space would solve much. Higher SP FW corps also have capitals, which you would lock them out of with this change.
---
3. Please don't add more damage capped structures with guns. POCO timers, HP and cost are fine if you ask me, maybe add the hacking mechanism like with citadels so you can figure out when their reinforcement cycle ends.
---
4. Remove FW missions while you're at it, give higher LP rewards for kills and capturing plexes (and make the payout get multiplied based on the total time the plex was contested, save a novice plex with a minute remaining and finish it &gt; get up to 1.9x times the LP reward)
---
5. How to determine the executor? Regardless of how this is done people might disagree etc. What could work is making it possible for corps to tax LP's, then being able to designate an area for lower LP tax as corp CEO.
---
6. Not a terrible idea.
---
7. I personally don't really like this idea, why should damage caps and EHP be lowered to what basically amounts to a really small fleet or something like 5 bashing battleships? 
---
It will be when someone posts AAR "How to take over a bunch of indy corps without shooting anyone - a year long report"...

I like this guy

Marshal is OP even if you ignore the sec status bonus. Its a redicilous ship all around
---
Only if snuff is close I guess, but I took a bs out last night and got a real fight, they may have had logi, but no caps were dropped.
---
What about neutrals/pirates that are looking for a fight? I think having number caps is a slippery slope to try balance without completely redesigning the plex mechanics.

Haven’t you horded enough into your room as it is?
---
No, you won't change my mind. That's because I actually know what was said, and what happened. Most of my beef is with CF leaderships actions back then to be honest. CVA was insanely frustrating to try to get standings from. We did what you asked. And then you changed the rules on us, and told us to try harder.
---
But you surely are trying to whitewash history here. ;)
---
Whaaaat. Where did you get a time machine back to 2010
---
Socratic
---
yes, but that's beside the point
---
I think ccp will ignore any plan you come up with tbh. Ccp were told when they announced citadels that they would ruin FW and they didn’t listen. While there are many issues with FW the biggest one is that system control doesn’t matter. Prevent citadel docking for FW participants when their faction does not control the system. Easy fix and would make system control matter again.
---
I know that, I'm just wondering what exactly I'd be doing with it to have actual pvp and not the fucking "let's try to catch a defenseless miner for 2 hours and then go back home" experience.
---
The simple answer is join a corp that does the kind of PVP you want to do. In Brave, I spend my days in standing fleet rushing from system to system popping neutrals in our space. I enjoy it a lot. 
---
Hahaha, no time machine. 
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/75902184/
---
The videos havent caught up yet. I've stopped running the station trading game but I spent like 4 or so days on it. It was a good experience but as you said isk-effort is very shit on that. Been doing FW recently while using the few hundred mil I made to bankroll his industrial stuff.
---
&gt;try lo sec first, you might get blobbers but at least you won't get a carrier dropped on you
---
lmbo
---
Me too.
---
Agreed, CCP didn’t and won’t listen about FW, so any plans are a waste of time. 
---
Oh, they indeed had caps on standby. Just in case you are winning (:
---

Axen erkejetter, he camps sibot and the nearby systems a lot, Ivan kapetanovic used to do the same

I see ratting battleships every other day
---
I guess he thinks that Lussy should fight 100 Subcaps or so with his 6 chars in shitty T1-Mass-Alliance-Doctrines like Feroxes too, so its "even" lol
---
whew, we crit all our holes and stayed up all night suitcasing just in case. Thank you for posting this reminder, I think we may have been the original target.  
---
Last night, after camping our crit static for 8 hours  with every available pilot and alt an astero last seen coming in from a low we rolled suddenly showed up and jumped it. Unfortunately our backstop carrier had fallen asleep, so after some rage pinging for more max carriers, we suicided another through the crit hole to roll it out. Unfortunately neither had probes, but the expediency demanded quick action.  
---
2 home defense carriers that had to SD are a low price to pay to ensure the safety of our assets. Thank you again whoever you are for helping us, and probably other WH corps save themselves with your reminder and clear direction on how to save ourselves. 
---

Do you have a link? Curious what was on it.

Que maravilla.
---
hey funnily enough i downloaded a few eve apps just the other day, and i noticed evanova didnt ket me fit multiple guns as i was comparing, which made me not use it, even though it was my favorite otherwise.
---
guess im back :D thanks
---
Well, we we're stuck in a soda pop factory a few years ago.
---
So will CCP release the stats on how many of their player base logged in for how long? Because everyone logging in accounts for a few seconds to claim free SP on this weekend (while still shitting on everyone who never got any for the chat and local fuck ups because they were not subbed on 1 day) should not really get included as really active accounts to show PA.
---
So in my mind, the point of FW is to add a bit more consent and structure to PvP. You know that you'll have opponents, you know where to find them, and you get extra rewards for it.
---
I'm also not saying every FW plex has to have this limitation, just add one such site to the rotation. A stepping stone to ease into larger fights.
---
I am coming from another MMO but i dislike the direction it is going so i am looking for a new time eating monster which eve is supposed to be. I am left with a few questions i would like to ask.Some are going to be very basic.
---
Should i get some kind of referral/friend code or is the benefit not worth it(any repercussion down the line)?
---
Can you get a feel for the game if you spend 1-2 hours a day in it or do you need to dedicate a lot more time for it? I still have obligations in my current mmo and just want to try out potential candidates for a switch.
---
Can you revert your decisions later down the line if you happen to regret them or should you spend a lot of time doing research on what you are about to do? Be it race, character, ships, skills or anything that you only learn about 300h into the game and are already commited to.
---
And now probably a really silly question even considering this threads name - What is the endgame like? I mean, i do get that it is a sandbox game, but how does your day usually play out? I am fairly competetive and used to strict raidnights, requirements i have to meet on deadlines and doing a lot of research, but how would that translate into eve?
---
Raiding(PvE) is set on exact times while i imagine battles(PvP) in eve are a lot more dynamic timewise. 
---
Are you expected to be on at certain times? Do you get a shedule in advance or something? What if i am not able to play for 1-2 weeks for whatever reason, is this a big factor in communitys?
---
At this point I just assume someone lighting a cyno anywhere near my JF is a super ganker. They even have their own jump freighters they jump to them to try to fool you. Always align, always dock if something jumps in, if a super is anywhere on grid even on a fort it’s there to gank you.
---
Yay, free skillpoints. No idea on what to spend them on, though.
---
Brave market is pretty well stocked. Sometimes you have to get things off contract or make a quick run to Amarr, but most common stuff is stocked. 
---
Sometimes we end up feeding if we take hard bait - like some wormhole denizens pop out in 4 bill Damas and wreck our shit. But the Catch Standing motto is "Always take the bait." We like content. Other times there's good fights we'll form up for if Goons bring a fun fleet through. And sometimes it's just an old school curb-stomping when the odd battleship comes floating through and we're all bored - https://zkillboard.com/kill/75841908/. We fight a lot of Goons lol. If you're interested in roams or strat ops, those are going out all the time too.
---
Princess Aricia :3
---
I don’t like this as an fc. Say we are running a system attack or defense fleet and have 12 people in fleet but the plex only accepts 10. I then have to choose who has to sit out and doesn’t get to participate. Seems counter productive when the goal is to keep people active and playing the game. 
---
Damn those bastards. Another $15.07 for them.
---
The training queue skill "squares" aren't square anymore. Literally unplayable.
---
HYPE HYPE HYPE!!!!111!!!
---
Correct. In smaller groups and especially solo you also do alot of jumps to find suitable fights, unless you have some neighbors that usually fight. 
---
In +3 au/s ships you can even pull enemy enemy gangs apart with a couple jumps.
---
Lol totally
---
It used to be Chessur. Then one day, I found him and fanboy'd out
---
So are the points applied to the highest SP character, whichever one you log into as, or every character you login with (per account)?
---
Halp
---
goys?
---
Yep it's broken for me too, it shows a skill I previously completed but the date is April third 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Hey, it's been 6 days. Did you hear back from their partners yet?
---
you can't create content as long as there is no point to FW
---
one of the major points of FW, was station access. Disallow player structures and then the space will be worth fighting over again.
---
:smith:
---
My guess would be, that they use the same system they used during the 13 days of christmas. Meaning, we'd get redeemable packages that contain the skillpoints.
---
Nah,  not enough piss and vinegar.

Haha free sp so I don't need to exacerbate the Plex bubble/capital proliferation/injector farm/buy buying/converting P2W skill extractors to injectors haha I love ccp this game is great.

I skimmed the parts about Stalin didn't do no wrong/but still not real communism :( and the parts about capitalism being responsible for the holocaust and tens of millions of deaths yearly, because it's verifiable horseshit of the highest grade. Where I am confused however is how the fuck did we end up at 
---
&gt;think it is perfectly fine to use slurs *literally* shouted at people being beaten to death 
---
in a discussion centered around censorship in an online game? Is the guy being edgy and naming is character with slurs responsible for acts of violence where said slurs were used? I am pretty sure a lot of violence involves people using words such as "HEY", "NO", "STOP", "HELP". Should we ban those words as well? And yes I take offense at your tyrannical, no fun allowed everything is absolute there's never any context or nuisance ban all the things ethos, it's infinitely more damaging and toxic than someone being edgy in an online game will ever be.
---
Which brings me to, after that trainwreck of a detour over people being beaten to death with the perpetrators saying bad words at the same time, how cognitively impaired do you have to be to be able to type out this in the following paragraphs with a straight face?
---
&gt; because people like you, think it is perfectly fine to use slurs *literally* shouted at people being beaten to death   
---
&gt; So you can straw man me all day   
---
&gt;because people like you
---
The point you're still missing and will never understand is that *what you believe communism to be and how it would fix everything* is, for those of us still attached to reality and able to understand causation, *what it always turns into*. Estimating a "death toll" on the basis of comparing current systems (which few people will say are perfect) by comparing it to ***your fantasy utopian system which will never happen*** is so fucking stupid it's hard to explain. 
---
Look mate, I am saying that you're objectively wrong, deluded and retarded, all of which are prerequisites to unironically support communism in the year 2019 when we have a century worth of examples where it always turns into a clusterfuck. At the end of the day, you should find the courage to own up to your hoarding of excess chromosomes. Send some over to me so I can stop being a bigot.
---
Didn't want to post this because it will inflate his ego but... Harvey Skywarker.

We have no local, jokes on you.

---
Desperate move, because the plummet this spring is one of the worst historically. and when you do the maths how many of those are actual players it actually becomes sad. :(  
---
Not that I do not play at least 5 days a week, but the slide is obvious 
---
&gt;Please :  
---
&gt;reduce damn clicking to reasonable levels  
---
&gt;make fighters orbit last position instead of just stoping after each command  
---
&gt;change all MJD with MWD or AB on all fighters  
---
&gt;modify bomb deployment so fighter bombers actually bomb selected area  
---
&gt;Basically make the UI and mechanic more friendly as 'ratters' will have no way to abuse it so much.
---
1. Only if they remove all utility and turn them into basic drones, maybe just a bit bigger then heavies.
---
2. Why ? Drones just kinda sit there, unless set on agro then they go after whatever is closest or damaging them, but otherwise they just sit there. I see no issues with this.
---
3. Agreed, they should be equal to regular drones in this regard and follow the curve or light / medium / heavy / light fighters / heavy fighters. Have their movement speeds adjusted accordingly.
---
4. They do, this is a user issue.
---
5. Streamlining the UI ? I suppose, but be careful what you wish for, take the Agency for example ...
---
Also I cannot stress enough that the wiki attached to that link is the single biggest collection of knowledge on eve outside of the people of this subreddit. Read as much as you can about the ships, the mechanics, the stories, the tactics, the fleet comps, the fitting advice, the magic 14, or anything you can think of. It is possible that this isn’t enough, and you may need to check other places. The no question is stupid thread pinned to this subreddit is a great tool, and refreshed every week. Some more niche tools are Fuzzwork for industry, pyfa for fitting simulation, zkillboard for fitting advice and kills made by players, plus thousands of little forum posts, old reddit threads, and independent sites.

When you do it to your own ship, insurance will never cover the cost to blow it up [it used to be possible to do that, they changed it]. You can auto-destruct your ship. The point here would be to blow up someone else’s ship [or find ships that were freshly blown up] and loot the cargo hold [if there’s anything in it, not a guarantee], or you can also salvage the wreck and get parts from that [is not lucrative].
---
You can also blow up rats [pirate ships in belts] and salvage those.

Can you create something that disables Intel Bots when they parse the Bio?

For TRC line members that used to fight for CVA were treated like this https://zkillboard.com/kill/64088228/ was when CVA logi refused to logi us in a fight to free a providence dread that was caught.  I churned through 5 ships that day fighting for provi the last one I went in with (if you could have ever called it this) and organized CVA response in which I was primaried and logi was told let me die by call of the glorious FC who's name I have forgotten over time now.  Then denied blue status for lack of PvP is insulting.  I for one am glad to shoot CVA the lie that they welcome all who play by their rules is absurd and shown for what it is through their actions. 
---
When our alliance left Provi, I had EQ himself tell me he would perma-kos my entire alliance for the simple crime of leaving. Our alts have camped Providence regularly since that day.
---
I'm not able to get other eve apps working either the last few days. I think it's a ccp problem not an app problem.
---
To be honest... were having some great discussions in this discord about the state of FW, and potential solutions to several problems.
---
I'd encourage anyone that's interested to join in with their suggestions.
---
There was a bot in local convo'ing people who came in that he was there with his alts. It was kinda annoying so I thought I would report it for him.
---
He convod me after and we had a lil talk about how he was pretty good at what he does but that bot doesn't help. Seemed nice for what he does
---
Just give away your shit and go, god.
---
What timeline back my my first years you looked out for Ryctor, Istvaan Shogatsu, anyone from Burn Eden, and you stayed the F out of Lonetrek.
---
Many other names but that is the first that comes to mind.
---
The game really had some badass scary dudes in local back in 2003 - 2004.
---
Shit man I remember going to the first market hub Yulai and all the famous pilots were there causing a scene.
---
Miss those days!
---
Always loved me a good MasL spawn. He's nice enough to bring the officer mods directly to you.
---
Both of you are using the ship wrong, it's a top tier smart bombing ship nerds.
---
Are you ok buddy? It's been a while since you had contact with real people or something like that?
---
1. When you create an account through a referral link, you get 250k skillpoints, which is equivalent to about 11 days worth of alpha training. It's nice but not a game-changer.
---
2. When you're starting out a 1-2 hour play session is entirely reasonable. Later on, you'll find most fleet ops finish in under 3 hours.
---
3. You cannot revert your character choices. Your choice of race does not affect your gameplay in any meaningful way, nor does it limit your outcome. Avatars can be resculpted. The most common regret is picking a shitty character name. The name will be with you forever so put some thought into it. 
---
4. EVE is open-ended. By the time you feel you've reached an 'end-game' you've probably mastered every conceivable activity, have built a fortune, and own several supercapital ships. You probably spend more time following the metagame than logged in and it takes 5+ years to get there. As far as activity, PvE is usually done alone on your own schedule. PvP battles are announced by your alliance in the form of pings on a 3rd party communication platform. Some events are scheduled while others are only available to those online at the time of the ping. Going inactive for a couple of weeks is seldom a problem, but you will be expected to maintain a minimum level of participation.
---
&gt; Should i get some kind of referral/friend code or is the benefit not worth it(any repercussion down the line)?
---
It's very much worth it (but not indispensable). The major benefit is you get 250,000 bonus skillpoints at the start (think of it as free levels), which equates to about 4 days worth of training for a new player, which is a pretty nice bonus. Also, once you eventually get a subscription, the friend who referred you also gets a nice amount of premium currency, so people will often agree to split up that currency evenly between them. That way, both parties incur an additional benefit. 
---
&gt;Can you get a feel for the game if you spend 1-2 hours a day in it or do you need to dedicate a lot more time for it?
---
You can definitely get a feel for it with 1-2 hours per day, but you have to be flexible in terms of when that time frame occurs. A lot of people find fleet PvP (dozens or hundreds of players fighting each other) to be their most enjoyable activity, especially early on, however you can't just find a fleet to join any time you like. So if you're ok with logging in at a specific time, and joining a fleet for two hours or so, you're fine. Other activities (ratting, exploration, solo PvP etc.) let you do them whenever you like more or less. 
---
&gt;Can you revert your decisions later if you happen to regret them or should you spend a lot of time doing research on what you are about to do? 
---
You cannot revert decisions, however it's very difficult to make an explicitly wrong decision. Most of your decisions come down to selecting skills to train, and selecting a player corporation for yourself. Most skills you train early on will benefit you one way or another even if they are not the optimal choice, and corporations you can switch as much as you like (or rather as much as they let you). 
---
&gt;What is the endgame like? 
---
This is a broad question, but you asked a number of follow-ups so I'll try to go through them one by one. Most of your PvE will be done on your own - for most people it consists of either exploration, ratting (shooting NPCs for money), or mining. I recommend against mining as it is the most boring option, even though much later on it's also one of the most lucrative. You can do any of these whenever you feel like. Some PvE consists of running dangerous sites in a fleet (look up "highsec incursions"), or multiboxing several accounts at once, but those are all options for later. 
---
Is PvP more dynamic? Hard to say, seeing as there's a ton of different variety when it comes to it. Sometimes, an enemy group will roam through your space and catch one of your miners, so you have to scramble to defend them. Other times, you decide to roam theirs. Either of these can happen whenever. On the other hand, most "strategic" objectives, such as structure defense or control of space (sovereignty) happen on timers, so you know in advance when you will have to defend or attack something. If you are in a corporation, they will usually have an "op timer board" - a place where you can check out upcoming fleets, as well as a discord server where they can ping you about them. 
---
You are not expected to be on at certain times - everyone understands that real life takes priority. Very few groups even have strict activity requirements. However, *when* you are online, you will often be expected to attend important fleets. So for example, you can't just keep mining while your alliance is running an important op elsewhere. 
---
Back to the initial question, "what is the endgame like?" - the answer is, it's different for everyone. There's no such thing as farming the best gear and waiting for new dungeons to release. Most people will specialize in a certain field until they excel at it. An industrialist might develop a vast library of top-quality blueprints and produce equipment for his corporation. A miner might invest in a fleet of rorquals to support that industrialist. A PvP player might take interest in special fleet roles, such as piloting interdictors, or even commanding the fleet of hundreds of people. On the other hand, they might enjoy a smaller scale fleet (up to 10 pilots), or even solo gameplay.

I’m 100% serious about it. The kind of woman who finds EVE as a viable pass-time is the kind of woman who is smart, engaged, knowledgeable and determined and, in my experience, they don’t fuck around when it comes to blowing stuff up.
---
Your average CandyCrush player is not going to find EVE an agreeable environment. The kind of woman who looks at that crazy place and says “Looks cool, I like it here.” that’s the kind of woman that’s going to be an asset.
---
There is also, I don’t know the name of the outfit, a corporation where all the members are women.
---
I’m not going to soft-soap it, because it’s not the place for it and I’m not painting a nice picture than it is: there are, sadly, a number of people there who will find it necessary to be an asshole to women. It’s dreadful that it happens. However, in open chat channels this is typically dealt with in a very ‘direct’ way, as they will be called out on their bullshit in short order. I have done so when I was a witness to it because I don’t tolerate that at all. If that ever happens in private chat: save your chat log, contact a GM and whoever it is will get a nice [not really] talking to.
---
I have been at several Fanfests in Iceland where there are a good number of women, I have never seen or heard of anyone being disrespectful towards the women. Also, they would be dealt with right away. I’ve not seen it, I’ve not heard about it. When you spend the money to go all the way to Iceland you’re going there because you believe in the idea of EVE. Being a dickhead towards women is not part of that equation.
---
EVE needs more women because, as I said, their perspective is invaluable. There are also female developers, this is [CCP Karkur](https://imgur.com/waKd7Vx). They are, without exception, respected and deeply appreciated. This is former Executive Producer [CCP Seagull](https://imgur.com/AIdiVjr). Very smart. Very nice woman.

Your pod can most definitely be blown up. What happens then is you end up in your medical clone [as opposed to a jump clone]. You used to lose skill points when that happened, but that idea has been suppressed as people with a lot of skill points found it impossible to work in that environment.
---
You get a new pod and a new n00b ship when that happens. You always have a ship to fly in, with very basic equipment. This is not a problem because you will end up having tens to hundreds of ships. I have no idea, nor do I care, how many ships I currently have. You will notice that this is a question that answers itself.
---
Never think that losing a ship is the end of your EVE adventure. Ships are there to be lost. You just want to make sure that you are able to replace your ship. You’ll always be able to fly another ship.
---
Elite Dangerous has a pretty fun factional warfare system. 
---
Basically NPC battles that you can join and influence. If we had more involvement such as donating resources to fund the war machine and are able to know where NPC fleets are, it would give players beacons to head to. 
---
It would also add other objectives to the war such as attrition, attacking NPC mining fleets, watching fleet movements etc.
---
PA dumping CCP already, top kek.
---
I totally concur. There’s a very comforting and comfortable feeling of wearing nice-fitting trunks. I totally agree there.

In the context of being a pod pilot, and that’s the only commentary I’m making, I think it’s going to be more comfortable to simply be nude in the liquid.

Why not? I’d like to think CCP was like “Hey, let’s toss our loyal fan base something”. Probably has another motive, but whatever.

If you look at the trend, the downward direction is not that drastic, but when you take into account the larger amount of alts and bots compared to 5 years ago, it is becoming sad.

If you like Indi and don't plan on going Omega sure mine it up find a an Orca with full boosts and a mind link(I know a guy)  You will make isk relative to the scale your playing on.

No doubt, Sin is best and only if you ignore marshal. Other blops have niche in fleet but shit when solo.

Yeah, I used to hate it as well. I used to find it annoying and awkward, and I would kind of blame that person for putting me in this situation now that I didn't ask for when I was just minding my own business. But it's not always been a "thing" to do. It's fairly obvious *why* it started if you look at *when* it started. It also becomes apparent that it's more out of respect for those who came before you who were not treated with respect.
---
So now when someone thanks me for my service, I just remember the people who were shit on for doing exactly what I'm doing, and then I quietly to myself pay them the respect and honor that they deserve.
---
There is a huge system with a bunch of sigs that need to be scanned down. The pacifier gets a decent scanning bonuses, but it also gets the fastest warp speed in the game (with the proper fit it is faster then a leopard). This makes all the 100+AU warps go significantly faster when bookmarking WHs.

These days its loussy lou or alts. I tend to fight him, not that it always goes well. Used to be MasL for sure. Something about his solo blops back in the day, then seeing it in person, made him kind of a white whale. never did get the better of that pilot...
---
Why can’t it be this simple? They have nothing to gain here. And aren’t adding any extra steps. No need to undock. No need to blap NPCs. Just login.

Laziness mostly. I have 1 of each rolling ship and 1 alt that can fly the largest ones (Megatron hig and non hig mega). Need to make another trip to town and buy 1 more of each so rolling isn't such a hassle. 
---
Will do! Thanks for the tip!
---
Frigs and cruisers getting burned down for bad piloting is not a headshot. I suggest you learn to fly each class well before moving on. Sure, preference for what to fly will develop. There is just so much to gain from understanding how to keep each hull alive and effective in various situations. Don't sell yourself short by giving up on the smaller hulls. Bhaalgorn is a great ship, and even better, super cheap for a faction BS. So its not the worst BS to learn pvp for that size hull.
---
Yes, its a great ship to learn frigate PVP in.
---
You definitely are, my friend.
---
We may not always agree with your theories and suggestions, but damned if you're not a clever pilot that keeps Goons on their toes. 5/7 would hunt you again and again.
---
just speculation and manipulation. Has nothing to do with the lack of "sales" as people keep saying.

---
and samthedog too! :feels syndicate man:
---
PornMaker.
---
Most of your questions are already answered, but just to add onto what's said by the previous folks:
---
1. The only 'repercussion' is that some of the larger groups request ESI checks before joining (effectively lets them see certain elements of your character history) and if they can see interactions between you and a player they're not a fan of - say you got the free skill points and some in game money or items as your 'share' of the rewards if/when going paid subscription - they'll want to know why in case you're an alt or friend of their enemy trying to infiltrate as a spy. But it's common enough for people to share recruitment links publicly that it should be fine as long as you remember to keep a note of where you got the code (Twitch channel, forum post, discord message, etc.). More of a "to be aware of" than a reason not to do it, and most definitely worth the minor hassle.
---
2. The way the game feels in the beginning is overwhelming and a lot more confusing and limited than it will with a couple of weeks. An hour or so a day (or less, although with a free account you'll want to log in daily to add skills to your training queue if at all possible) is fine, but don't base your decision off a week of this. Especially with a free account, there's no need to commit, so you can keep testing it out for a month or two months or two years as much or as little as you want. They have a free skill points this weekend (log in once on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday to get all rewards) which will make a big difference to early training, so worth starting before then and getting some freebies, but just give it a whirl as test it until you find what you like doing, and then decide.
---
3. There is an option of Skill Extractors, so you can 'unlearn' skills and apply the points to other skills if you find you've wasted time training something and wish you'd chosen something else. But to be honest, it's an expensive process and can only be done once you're over 5.5mil skill points, so not worth it given the low skill point requirements for the stuff you'll get early on: by the time you invest in anything actually decent (and have enough skill points to be able to extract) you'll know what you're doing. In terms of race, etc. there is no difference other than starting ship/skills/zone, and you can train the other racial stuff or fly to the other zone, so meh. The only big one is the name: you cannot change it later under any circumstances, so be very sure you won't regret it later, and don't go for anything offensive lest it be reported and replaced with "Gallente Citizen 456633" or some such badge of shame.
---
4. Nothing much to add other than it depends on who you play with. Some have regular scheduled fleets/ops, some are more dynamic based on structure timers or other stuff that'll mean nothing to you but you get a bit of advance warning, some are just "anyone on want to do some [X]?". Research corps (guilds/clans), don't be scared to ask recruiters questions or trial membership and leave if it's not a good fit, and remember that there's much more scope for solo play or PUG fleets that are less toxic than most MMOs if you haven't yet found your forever-home.

however they are brainwashed into thinking that military members are by default protecting america from *something* and should be thanked for it. then kids grow up thinking vets are "heroes" and shit because mom showed deference to the guy in uniform just buying groceries

its perpetuating propaganda

TRC were the Jamyl Syndicate alliance under Providence, they became 'The Rouge Consortium' when they were slighted by bad diplomacy, so you may be getting confused.

---
It is very agile and will escape almost everything even without cloak, works better in wormholes.
---
Excuse me? 
---
You'd probably be better explaining the market rather than trying to be funny. I mean, not for me, I just think this was boarderline cringe material, and i get you're trying to build an audience, but I think taking someone like Delonewolf's eve videos and market talk videos would probably do you better. Maybe mix some industry if thats your thing? 
---
no :(
---
Nothing current, and we don't get to know about planned sales/discounts. There is much speculation that CCP will have a sale on Plex soon™ to rebalance the market, but that's pure guesswork/hope. Best thing to do is keep an eye on this subreddit, as every time something like that happens, it's posted about fairly swiftly.
---
75k for Alpha accounts, 250k for Omegas
---
I'm assuming Force Auxiliaries replaced repping carriers at some point?  I never had much interest in piloting capital ships, and I only have my main (89M skillpoints) and one transport/Empire alt (66M).  Considering the skill grinds, I'm not going to bother with any more characters.
---
I wouldn't call it for wormholers though. The local delay would be a pirate bonus of sorts, while the forced wormhole local would be an offensive move for attacking pirates in their hole.

---
FW is fucked.  Its a no win.  CCP wanted a stepping stone to null sec for newer corps.  In reality it was farmed for easy kills until people gave up.  Now its just vets farming the LP.  
---
I suggest this change to lower the amount of farming without removing the danger.  Make a change too sec status and jump gates.  Under -2 and you simply cant enter high sec at all.  Under -4 and you cant go to low sec either.  This will force tagging to raise sec status and it ties it to the eve market.
---
There are some slight offshoots. You can get the Expedition Frigates if you want to gas/ice mine better than a Venture. You can go the route of Porpoise-&gt;Orca if you want to use mining drones or boost a fleet of alts/friends. But for solo regular mining, you're literally looking at Barges (or Exhumers if you can swing the extra costs/SP).
---
Wasn't there a FW discord already ?
---
Stop with your helpful comments, this is a place of memes and mockery.
---
that rusrus roaming gang is scary good, they roam for hours at a time all over lowsec and just kill everything in their way.
---
Have a look at the question I asked CCP Falcon in the comments above. It could be worth submitting a ticket.
---
a clean astero alt shortly followed by a cyno and one Fredrick von Hole.
---
I believe it's done when the jf warps to a gate. Super cynos or warps to npc station. Kills said jf since it cant jump or dock while you try to warp unless you cancel warp. People panic and forget about that so generally get alpha'ed off the field by anti cap fighters 
---
The lack of reliable 1v1 content is what made me quit in the first place, not lack of small fleet/gang PvP. I just want to be able to slap together a cute T1 frig and not get assraped by someone with $40 worth of implants or a friend.

In null with the cyno beacon structures you can or you can make a public fleet a light a cyno on npc structures or even your own and kill idiots. But you can only jump to beacons that are in your fleet or you're on the access list if it's the structure beacon

I would love the cash but I have like 400mil in assets and market holds (it was a gift) I just didn’t want to waste money. Give the 50 million to some who’s more space poor
---
eve has an official forum? who knew
---
Sixty ever4 (the tuskers), he kites the living shit out of people when i was in horde (i left recently), he used to fly retri's and loki's, i actually like when he is around since he provides content.
---
Elite is a good example of the worst possible direction for CCP to go with FW.
---
I'd be curious to see this document as well.
---
What gets you more money, exploring or killing exploration ships?
---
Wants me to die in a fire. Classy.
---
Not quite. For a while there I'd login to BDO and spend 15 minutes going through all the crud they gifted over the weeks I hadn't played.
---
Because?
---
Give some to me
---
sluuurp ahh delicious sp
---
Well this dude did say he was a wormholer btw
---
and they are all rich right
---
*snips in exitement*
---
duh they can't control the fighters after each kill because they are busy posting it on reddit

---
some wanted to dump a large stockpile and scared manipulated the cost. 
---
If people are upset, ccp should know about it
---
It's marketing, getting people to subscribe. It's a nice way of doing it, rewarding the people who are already subed. Instead of doing like galaxy pack deals.
---
Sorry! Er never not fit nanos
---
That just reminds me of a video...
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjUBymhbrzw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjUBymhbrzw) 
---
You obviously dont run blood raider sites. Cloaky t3's in blood raiders sites are dead cloaky t3's. 
---
The kind of faction goods that the players want.  
---
I think TRI is already doing pretty good, they had some good fight in pure blind, I don't know about their activity but at least they try to do some stuff 
---
People tell you to never undock in what you can’t afford, but personally I think that’s a boring rule. Just YOLO it and if it goes wrong, meh, at least you learned and can improve. 
---
A 1v1 plex sounds like the perfect place to run a cap stable dual rep high grade asklepian magus, unkillable by a solo ship cruiser down. 
---
Is it that desperate?
---
Yup. Carriers don't generally rep stuff since FAX's are much stronger.   
---
Given how much more frequent subcapital fights are, that's a better place to put your skill points. 
---
fuck. this keeps happening to me.
---
It's a weird little personality cult, but man they've been at it since at least 2013 so more power to 'em.
---
Capital pulse spec 5 duh
---
But but if you look at the BR only the armor supers survived...never not shield
---
I mean it's great in nullsec, but in wh there's no gate camp so you don't have to fear getting instalocked (if you have no cloak) and no local (so it's hard to track you even if no cloak)
---
Already have 930k SP from CCP...
---
I literally have no idea what to train, or maybe inject and extract :thinking;
---
Why? There's always something to interact with in Elite whether it's players or NPC's and your efforts have a direct impact on the influence of who you're working for. 
---
Not saying the interactions are always perfect, because it isn't. The devs don't play their own game and there's times the NPC's are just stupid.
---
But Elite is growing in popularity, Eve isn't. I'm coming back to puke my head around at the changes as try to play again. Factional warfare looks like the same blobs and gate camping as before, missions don't seem to have an impact beyond getting compensation for playing the same missions over and over, and I'm really not sure if I'm having fun. 
---
But that's just my perspective. Having NPC fights allow for more options. Leaving every interaction to the players limits those interactions to player income. The inability to empower or impact a faction feels empty.
---
Fuck reddit downvote brigade, CCP should do it, I would so love carriers going back to what they used to be
---
Tfw your login is broken so you cant get your sp
---
Hmm, free SP on April 1st...
---
True
---
I mean this is a nice gift but it smacks of desperation over metrics. What happened to the promise we had when injectors were introduced about 'no SP out of thin air'?
---
This is half a skill injector per account of profit straight into the pocket of all the skill farmers.
---
I don't think eve needs more tutorials. I'm mostly just trying to find a way to make content out of each of my streams. Not all of them are video worthy but I'm trying to force myself to find content where there is very little. I'll be the first one to say that my videos aren't good but I like them. Sorry if this sounds defensive, I very much appreciate the criticism. I'll continue to do better with the upcoming videos.
---
think you need to install eft/pyfa 
---
Reading the whole reply to much for you? 
---
Osimium is still alive???

I saw this and thought "that bench is for blankets you idiot why is all this stuff on there!?"
---
I'm the idiot.
---
Fly safe capsuleer. 
---
Ataryx is a nice dude 
---
Send him hentai in local and he will probably forget to kill you
---
Sorry to be the bearer of bad news lol but you cannot change your name in game
---
If you want a better name, do it now while you're new. If you wait you'll end up losing SP you trained :)
---
You won't lose assets if you make a new character on the same account, as you can always contract your stuff over to the new character.
---
Anyone i havent seen logged in since 2015
---
I give it ~40 mins before they cancel it due to a giant stream of hostile shitposting.
---
1. Small Shield Extenders are pretty much useless. Use Mediums for frigs.  
---
2. Unused rig slot. Replace the Extender II rig with two of the Tech 1 variant.  
---
3. What is this frig for? It has no point, so I'm guessing it is not for PVP.  
---
I'm on mobile. First website I found that could fit. I have pyfa at home. Had a character since 09. Getting really into it now.
---
Can confirm. Went to solo PVP in a Mega. Got Nyx'ed. Tried again a few days later. Got Erebus'ed. I will no longer be doing that any time soon.
---
Not for pvp. Just tryna make a shield tank frigate. Do some pve.
---
It'll get cancelled like everything else that brings them money.
---
It'll still contain more bugs than a museum dedicated to bugs.
---
🤔
---
now i want to give you 50 mil even more....
---
The chat will break eventually.
---
CEO of the people would do the AMA here. 
---
5% but way more % diff in speed
---
Is osmium back?!?!?!?!
---
First of all, you'd want to tank for specific damage types. All NPCs deal a primary and secondary damage types (there are exceptions). Don't bother tanking the other two.  
---
The Kestrel should be fine to start with, but you should consider upgrading pretty quickly. If you want to stick with missiles, check the Talwar and Corax.
---
alts are being dropped to alpha all over the place due to plex prices too.
---
For the metrics to make sure they get the cash from the PA deal, they have to massage the numbers so they hit the targets.
---
Don Trolleone... All of them
---
&gt;They have nothing to gain here.
---
Apart from, you know, the millions extra from the PA deal if they hit the metrics needed of logins and subscriptions.
---
Will do. 
---
What ya gonna use this fer?
---
Also, the Kestrel has a bonus to range, so you shouldn't need to tank too much. Kite the enemy, and add more damage (Ballistic Control Systems, or missile-rigs).
---
I'm not sure people are going to sub strictly for 200k free SP but I see your point. Metrics are important and may affect any evaluations of player stats and company value. I think the point of my first comment was just to say maybe, *just maybe*, it is that simple.
---
And omegas can claim alpha points too
---
Evanova had an update recently, try that
---
Yeah, I am just saving them for something special, but nothing ever peaks my interest...
---
If you drop with a Sin, make sure you use the key binds available for drone use. It'll make that critical moment when you load grid a lot more efficient and help in survival of you and your drones. I only say this because Sins that dropped with me would always seem to have a harder time multi tasking.
---
For a total of 250k.
---
25k for Friday, 50k Saturday and 100k Sunday.
---
Alpha is 25k/day
---
They'll be sitting in my skill que with the 500,000 I received for the local chat fiasco until I can afford a Titan skill book.
---
Oh, your totally right.  I guess I should have read better...
---
No worries. I had to reread it and do the math. 
---
 Wahhhhhhhh 
---
Because others fucked up TRI when he was away.
---
You cyno in / warp a super on the undock when the jf aligns to a stargate and bump it out of docking range, then haze with fighters
---
So, just to clarify every character on an account can claim them if they are logged in each day?
---
This is true, if you're in a gang there's still some decent utility to the Widow. But solo is another matter. 
---
what profits? 
---
Sure, it might not be great for solo, but it's fantastic in a gang. Jump in, cap booster, MJD, jam at 100. We use them to shoot carriers (jam the fighters) because then you make the carrier waste his MWD cycle on his fighters to go after your widow which can just warp, come back and start the process over again.
---
I couldn't agree with this post more.
---
Heroin doesn’t give you a rush
---
Most of them, jf undocks from npc station in LS, hits warp to out gate.            
---
            
---
Bad guy lights cyno and in comes a nyx.           
---
          
---
At this point a jf that was aligning can dock but a jf that hit warp must hit ctrl space then dock.       
---
Alpha from a gank fit nyx hits for most of the JF’s ehp, so if you don’t dock quickly you’re going to pop.

As someone who goes out through a null static multiple times a day, I see rattlesnakes all over FRT/Russian space, as well as smartbombing battleships pretty much everywhere else.

This is a community event not CCP

Just want to max shields

Ya will got way more shield in a Harpy
---
Eveiseasy is the most well explained and educational channel imo. Suitonia, the guy hosting it is pretty intelligent and have great rhetorical skills. 
---
I haven't seen anyone deny the clear proof of the BR with the munins, I usually just hear about how you all just SD'ed all your caps.
---
Rockmuncher666 Hated when that dude would show up in Horde space lol just dock up and wait. Then he joined Horde and showed us a lot &lt;3
---
The Drekavac is pretty goddamn fun.
---
Well clearly I didn't read the article or intend on attending.
---
you - "if you like to listen to some idea ramble and get off topic every 2 second", me - "NOPE!"
---
title of this post should be reduced to only the last word as it is the only relevant part xD
---
There are many objects which persist in space, some indefinitely.
---
Example:
---
* Secure containers
---
* Mobile depots
---
* Starbase modules (I have some 'art' pictures of these somewhere)
---
* Upwell structures (I think one was recently added to mark location of the first but now destroyed keepstar)
---
CCP has been teasing player advertisement centers (billboards) for years, so maybe someday.
---
why not set them off 40 away, scram and web and perfect tracking right on optimal?
---
Reminds me of living in deep null back in '05.  Didn't have to scan anything down, but any supply or selling run was 23 jumps through mostly hostile space.  Noob scout alt and lots of patience was the only way.  Sometimes took a couple of days if there were hostile camps to wait out.
---
code smells.
---
I would up vote you a few hundred more times if I could. It was 3 or 4 days before I got started in fw but since then I've turned over nearly half a billion isk. I've added another 50 plex and have well over 200 mil isk to bankroll product turnover. Today I was late to market on another 100 mil but the price will come around again soon enough. I'll just sit on it till then. Yet still my LP is growing faster than I'm using it even though gaining LP is probably the least time consuming part of it. I've lost 4 or 5 ships so far but that's no more than a couple of mil at worst.
---

Guados and Anderson Williams, pretty sure they both quit though.
---
Make it more popular and something that people can see as exciting. As it stands, that isnt Eve.
---
No, but the fits from there are hosted on fuzzworks.
---
https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/osmium/ships/
---
Why not just leave it out of that domain? I feel like we would be trying to make it into something its not
---
I was undocking my dread/carrier while he had cyno up on station. I think our convo make him not wanna kill me because nothing came, but I also think I'd dock in time regardless. 
---
No, hosted on fuzzworks from the old site.
---
I liked what erstschlag did, 2nestors as refit services, 10 players in same ships (i think they were praxis) several containers all over the place, not further than 100km off nestors and "virtual" boundaries 200km off nestors.
---
each container had something different, one had drones, one shields, one guns etc. and it was up to players what they take and fit to win.
---
That was just perfect event on sisi and should be considered as proper game mod, eg. even or whatever.
---
A strategy game needs a minimum pace to be watchable. EVE's pace is way too low.
---
Booshing hasn’t changed since it’s release. Any guide you find won’t be out of date. 
---
Watchlist is your friend
---
* Goons and Provi shoot each other on sight. 
---
* Provi has Goons set to red, Goons have Provi set to neutral.
---
* Occasionally Provi and Goons have aligned interest and are on the same side.
---
* Neither side considers the other to be a hostile entity, just someone to have combat with.
---
Raikiri and his alts. Dudes persistent when you hunt in Delve, good at counter-hunting though.
---
Framing my reply as a conspiracy is pretty rich. This whole line of discussion seems to hinge on the idea that large alliances and their leadership are, knowingly and with intent, allowing and encouraging botting in their space for their own enrichment and they are somehow responsible for there being botters in their orbit ko matter how remote. I'm not propagating a conspiracy theory sweet cheeks, you are :)
---
Thanks for giving the video a shot. Sorry it wasn't what you wanted.
---
Interesting. My missiles skills are pure trash tho, I have nearly nothing invested in it...
---
Wait, you’re using an Apoc with launchers ?
---
I know, I'm here for you buddy
---
Years ago, I was in Calmil with a group of pilots I met when I first started playing. We were a driven group of dudes out to claim a stake of the grand expanse of New Eden. We setup in low-sec systems like Pavanakka, Nenn, Pyne, Hikk, Akidagi, Tama, etc with stations and POS's spread over the region - for a small corp, we were living large and training to be a reckoning force. We were suiciding Dreads and Carriers before it was popular, even at one point defending a POS with a handful of Megas and an Archon against a 100+ Goon fleet.  
---
Anyway, over time, I would consistently run into these two pilots named Wasa Qc and Maxine Antilles. They rarely, if ever, engaged if we were fleeted up. But if you were on a solo expedition, plexing or running missions, you were fair game. And they made it their mission to hunt you down. Over the course of a couple months, Wasa and Max became synonymous with death and destruction. We would throw ourselves at them, time and time again. I learned quickly how to manually pilot and, admittedly, these two pushed me to learn how to maneuver and slip if I was outclassed. They became my white whale. I never did quite get the confidence to take them on the way I would now. Never got to claim a gf in local. They instilled in me the fear and loathing I wish any players could experience, and the drive to do better.
---
SNOT NICE!
---
This guy used to fly around in Gallente FW doing missions for the Caldari in shit fit Drakes. At first it was easy kills, but it was really cool to see how this guy just got better and better at fitting his Drake and reading dscan. It got to the point where our Corp would just wave in local because he finally got wise. 
---
One of the few cool FW farmers I've met.
---
Callous Jade, because that meant Snuff was sitting on a titan just waiting to drop on something.

When I was new I did lvl 4 SOE in my only Dominix. Count Scary killed it in a proteus. I had such low skills that I was only doing double digit damage in him with my drones. I was so mad I put the largest bounty ever. I think it was like 10-20 million. It was a lot as I only had 100-200 million isk. I received 1.5 years worth of bounty notices everytime he died. It was annoying and act as a regular reminder what happened that awful day. 
---
Thank you :)
---
Sadly, I don’t know if south’s nullsec is the best place to learn solo PvP with small hulls, and I don’t have access to FW since I can’t join a militia...
---
I guess I could start with the cruisers. Apparently, they can have either the tank of a Battleship, or the DPS of one, so it might be a good compromise.
---
great video man

This is stupid and one of the last things this game needs

you don't because sports are the opposite of eve

We’re happy to announce that at 14:00 UTC on Thursday, March 28th, we’ll have an AMA with CCP Hellmar, CEO of CCP, right here on the official EVE Online forums.
---
The AMA will occur in a thread that will be set up closer to the time tomorrow, but we’ll also be collecting questions in advance too.
---
If you’d like to discuss the AMA or pose a question in advance for our CEO, then feel free to do so in this thread.
---
Only one rule - remember to keep it civil and within the forum rules, and we’ll be all good!
---
A short while after the AMA is over, CCP Hellmar will be appearing on Talking in Stations at 16:00 UTC to talk through some of the questions and answers.
---
You'll be able to tune in here, on the Talking In Stations Twitch channel.
---
It's piqued* not peaked

One 10b marauder fighting 15 t1 cruisers 
---
No, you would normally want me to die in a fire.  I read it correctly.
---
It's per account, you can give each pack to a different character on the account. 
---
Could he have picked a better time? Everyone will either be asleep, at work, or in school.
---
Short version:
---
Catiz’ Family is known for a prominent Udorian heritage, and as such are not seen as pure True Amarrian. Though the Succession Trial should have proved her right to rule, religious fundamentalist elements see her as a threat to tradition and purity. 
---
Her Family is also heavily involved in economic matters. For some, this may seem like a promise of improved trade and relaxed regulations. For others, this could me a corrosion of traditional values in the pursuit of material gain.
---
Mostly, though, no one cares. CCP haven’t really done anything interesting with Catiz’ rule yet. 
---
Solo, I'm not so sure. But, 5 Ishtars with sentries assigned to an instant locking ship. That may be some fun.
---
Thanks for clearing things up
---
I think there is, or used to be, an automated welcome Eve-mail that stated something like:
---
"Welcome to Eve!  You are already dead."
---
Which is technically correct, as capsuleers are 'infomorphs' (think 'minds') without permanent bodies.  To become a capsuleer, your body must die so that your mind can be copied (scanning is a fatal process).
---
Capsuleers are immortal, since they can move between bodies.
---
When your pod is destroyed, you awake in your medical clone, located at your 'home' location (changeable), and a new medical clone is grown for you free of charge.
---
There is also two skills that allow you to create additional clones that you can move between, for instant travel across space, or to select a clone with a different set of implants.
---
There are 3 trailer videos that cover this topic.  One us "Origins'.  Will edit with links when I can.
---
Bring back the AT would be a start 
---
weve been having a good time this past couple weeks in immensea, catch, and querious. had to pick and choose fights with decent number of jumps between though. honestly i think the north (gotg/horde) is more fun and fewer jumps between fights, but if you must stay in the south the content is still there, just need a little more work to get at.
---
Understood, thanks !
---
can reconfirm this bug, happening on two of my alts. Strangely not even once on my main.
---
yikes, good point. 
---
lol if you tested that theory that most think Vietnam Vets are involved, you may be surprised by the outcome. Hell, you just proved the opposite to be correct for one person in this very thread lol.
---
She is the true emperess of the holy Amarrian empire. Those who would question that authority would be deceivers and enemies of the empire, trust not their words or deeds for they shall lead you astray from the flock into the mouths of wolves. 
---
Rage is good people
---
&gt; We had 52 Domis
---
That's fucking terrifying. Congrats on the form-up.
---
If she was properly elected she is the true empress. I was merely interested in the apparent controversy surrounding her although I would never deny her authority. She has my undying loyalty. 
---
Are you sure there is a great percentage of people who plex their accounts?
---
2 dominixes in distance + dramiel to decloak, assist drones to dramiel, kill. 
---
No need to bubble even.
---
A second one, ofc. Till all the characters in the region are you.
---
You don't even need to bump the jump freighter, if it starts aligning during the invulnerability undocking timer, it cannot dock back and is vulnerable to high-alpha attacks for that duration
---
They didn't know that because they didn't read the article and also because they're a tool.
---
Hoping can make it to this, one of the very few that are convenient driving distance in the midwest.
---
Best of luck boys. I hope CCP gives at least one fuck this time and this barren area flourishes again.
---
Yeah, having a single ship to bring, rather than having to worry about dps/logi balance or skillpoints is great. Also with insurance, you're getting a ton of repping power for very cheap; the equivalent number of Oneiros/Guards would definitely cost more.
---
I also have a special place in my heart for pure drone doctrines, because as a person those drones are usually assigned to, there's nothing more satisfying than locking something down and watching the death ball of drones descend upon them.
---
RR Domis + Loki fingers would be super fun to do in nullsec, except you'd just get carrier dropped or end up fighting Machs.
---
Thank you man :) is appreciated 
---
https://evewho.com/pilot/CCP+Hellmar
---
Well that would be a good start , I love watching the AT and would like to see this put into a way that others could play
---
Why the expanded cargo hold? Loot? 
---
What a fucking retarded response
---
Do I have the internal stats? No. Do I know hundreds of fellow players that plex multiple alt accounts and do so personally as well? Yes. 
---
I remember getting my first one, and how pissed I was at how many do went into training it, and how m7ch oak went into buying it/fitting it, to only have a GODDAMN FUCKING 3000m3 CARGO BAY HUARGHFRGHFLR...
---
...Then someone educated me on the fleet hangar. It's been love ever since lol
---
3200's are big af. This way you can carry more so you can be in space longer without resupplying. Can be worthwhile, but its less relevant now that they buffed the BS Cargo holds
---
such as chess?
---
Replace the data/relic hacking minigame with FIFA.
---
I'm gonna be honest, I don't think this type of content is meant for you. There was nothing happening in the video and you were making what seemed to be really cringey, trying-too-hard-to-be-funny jokes that didn't really make sense. The video had almost no substance and wasn't funny, at all. I think you should try a different format or type of content. 
---
No
---
Muahahaha..it has single handedly enabled my cap building project. I now have two toons in transport ships as a result.
---
She's a high sec pubbie.
---
You're 100% right to hate the ISK grind.  I never understood why folks will play an outer-space game, and then choose a career that is *more* boring than the one they have in real life. No mining for me.
---
Pubbie?
---
The player base is dwindling! Hurry apply free SP to get them back!

"please guys anchor on vyshfvadfaljf-adjffjkaadfjlaf" (not joking)
---
something like abyssal arena ?
---
Its a combination of both, you can't say the lack of sales has had no impact.
---
sentries spread out randomly will not have the affect you desire. there are 2 more common scenarios in this situation where transversal is minimized. Assuming the gate is bubbled in a manner to cover the entire 13km sphere: 1) the gankee re-approaches, in which have the sentry at 0km on the gate would help minimize transversal for all drones. this scenario also applies then the gankee takes the most direct route out of the bubble as sentry on the gate once again have good positioning for minimal transversal. 2) the gankee aligns outgate, in which the sentries would need to be on the same line as the gankee's vector (better in pipe systems). 
---
These kind of stories are the best part about EVE
---
God bless! Roaming LS in 2019 needs seem serious patience 
---
At this prices it is profitable for them to kill almost all stuff on the list by themself 
---
Booshing has changed in that it applies an aggression timer now, however /u/TheWindows9 was asking specifically about stealing excavator drones, which has changed significantly in that the range required to do it is now 500km instead of the 100 or 200km it used to be, so effectively you need 6 successive booshes to pull it off. 
---
[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/97nt10/i_stole_150_excavators_from_goons_in_20_days_ama/) is a bunch of up-to-date info on the subject from the person who is hands-down and by far the most proficient at it - /u/olmeca_gold

The people I know are on par let's say. I don't understand why would anyone pick plex instead of cheaper sub, but you are right a lot do.

&gt;any tips on how to maximize the SP income?
---
Log into all your accounts, Omega and Alpha
---
&gt;can i trade to an other character?
---
My assumption is when you login to a character, you'll be given the option to 'Redeem' the points on that character. Once you've done that for one character on an account, that'll be it for that account.    
---
You can certainly extract the skill-points to sell via the existing extractor/injector mechanics. 
---
C5/C6 black hole Barghest disagrees with you ;)
---
EY WE GOT SUM MORE OF THAT POPCORN?

At those price's, its worth making a public contract on yourself just for content.

oh god, im loling in the office

Never been a better time to "self destruct" that Wyvern.

What if I kill a NSH svipul camping the PF-346 gate?

I think if you are over the alpha amount you still get the unallocated SP and apply it to go over the limit you can gain from free training.
---
Extreme think 
---
You seem mad. Are you mad?
---
Well it was his decision to put them in charge and disappear so the fault is his. I remember it all began with Captain pat. What a train wreck.

Ditto my dude

Hijacking your post to ask about these guys. What is their story? Who organizes them?

For me it was CtrlFreak when he was with snails.  You knew things were going to get hairy

You should join salty intent, you  sound like you would supply them for a lifetime.

Thanks for the feedback. I'm forcing myself to find content in the streams. I took a full week worth of streams and edited them. The best bits went into "A station trader was born", from then on I kept cutting back until this one. Right now, I'm editing the next week worth of videos and I'll do my best to be a bit more selective on the editing.

I see you're a man of culture as well.
---
I'll have your sp if you don't want it. 
---
OMG. Dude is responsible for more low sec rage than any corp/alliance could possibly wish for. Bane of shiney pods for years. 
---
Oh yes. Very much yes.
---
Hey Hyde mic Wallypost. 
---
300m/h is reeeeeeally pushing it, and that's with a magpie, all outpost frontiers, drugs, implants, and a really bling fit.
---
A much more realistic number is about 200m/hour, where you're not risking a 200m magpie, 2 bil fit and 2 bil pods, and the cost of the drugs/nanite paste
---
The old PODLA crew were so much fun to fly with. 
---
Why? It's a game, not a public service. 
---
If you feel Eve has introduced a toxic element to your life, stop playing it.
---
Can you Boosh a cyno ship? Will it bring the cyno with you? Will ships cynoing into system land at the cyno effect or the cyno ship? 
---
I just sent ticket to support and hot rejected that i already got the 500k sp... Ehhhhh
---
LuCiFAs Son, a suspect baiter that has killed hundreds of billions worth of isk in ships. He usually hangs out around Ashab nowadays, from what I can tell. Sadly I fell into his trap once too. I am fairly new to the game, and at the time I didn't know what fleet hangars were, what Bowheads did, or that possibly the neutral Bowhead flying up to me and the suspect Sigil was an alt. Thought everything was fine until the Sigil disappeared and I was blasted away by a Vigilant.
---
Also last week a corpmate of mine lost a Tengu to him and I had a good chuckle over it. At least I wasn't the only one that didn't know about suspect baiting. 
---
Don't insult Wallyposts like that.
---
True. I’m sorry wally
---
In addition to the normal "get em while they are trying to warp"
---
An older, but still fun trick is to wait for them to undock, then undock your own dread and siege bump them while they are trying to align. 
---
Also pro-tip for JF pilots: Always align to the gate, never just cold-warp to it. You'll be able to instantly dock as you won't have to cancel a warp. 
---
Bonus tip: use a friendly citadel instead. 
---
Replace all references to "CCP" with "this subreddit" and you might have a point.
---
But re CCP - buddy, it's a game. If it's making you that unhappy, play something else.
---
Don't worry you are right next to him in my heart Ronan &lt;3
---
My sub just ended today and I'm a broke boy, I'll sit this one out.
---
Is this how you’re going to spend all that money from smuggling supers?
---
I always got excited to see [Flesh Rocket](https://zkillboard.com/character/860110770/) in local.
---
This is the greatest post ever. MAN LOL
---
i approve of this product/service !
---
Garst is life. 
---
i m sure BOB will love this
---
Apparently all these new MMO/Distributed Engine companies think than simulating clients on VMs 10,000-30,000 times over is a realistic scenario
---
Insure first. 
---
i think he needs to worry about himself , what if he gets kicked from his own alliance for smuggling supers outside
---
I can justify lazy semi afk krabbing/trading while doing something else to the wife, can't really justify multiple account subs.

a stable leader.....which for EVE. SUCKS.
---
we like the leaders who say fuck staiblity. we're gonna create some chaos.
---
Very worrying. Goons keep letting this stuff slide by and they will be dead by Halloween to the very supers they made. 
---
Shabbas goy. 
---
does it even matter? it's an NPC with a story arc that's long forgotten, her "coronation" fleet was still in Amarr last time I bothered to check... and it happened years ago... forgotten like many CCP ventures...
---
NSH 3.0 Closing. 4.0 Opening next March!! SEE YOU THEN
---
I'm reading this now its so true lmao
---
It doesn’t matter. I’m just interested. 
---
Just popping in here "for the record" to say: this is an obvious CCP move to hit the targets set by their Korean overlords, don't be surprised when they finally get their paycheck then throw the game under the buss entirely (arguably it's already been there for a while now but hey, who knows how low it can go...)
---
also i would like to point out the lack of actual responses in this thread implies no body else gives a shit.
---
kay
---
ad hominem
---
Goons have more supers than people to pilot them. Not sure they care.
---
But can we can get off the topic of military and talk more about Eve and the community? I took the picture the way I did, and described what happened the way I did, so that the person who left the note would respond. And it worked. So seriously, lets drop the real world politics and talk about Eve yeah :)
---
I for one will be killing something. I need that dank isk.
---
im sorry that youre a nobody in your own alliance and can't kill some noobs structures :(
---
Ahah, I'm glad to see Vyshne finally getting the spot he deserves in Provi. Rose up through the grind with that dude back in like 2012. Mad respect for him :)
---
No collusion.. No collusion 
---
My experience with Elite was a few years ago, and since then I've only heard developments from one friend who as kept up a bit and described things as not having changed much.  But ya, I tried to get into the Elite FW system and thoroughly disliked it. As far as PVE content goes, it is better than EVE... but that's not saying much at all.   
---
I found the FW content not worth the hassle of engaging with.  Not only that, but they required a constant individual grind to make progress that you would quickly lose if you stopped playing.  More progress required more grinding. No thanks.
---
Ehhhhhhhh not really. If by pvp you mean astero v astero or ganking t1/2 explorers then yeah it's great.
---
Yup totally. Domt touch or shoot out widow in armor brawls. Totally useless 
---
i approve of this service/product
---
LSH / NSH seem to be dicky.. there was no attempt to delete them that were succeful.
---
LOL
---
Ehhhhh naaaa. What makes a Explo frig great is a cloak.
---
Board game isn't the same thing as a video game. And the pace isn't fixed its very much dependant on the players. See also card games like poker and card video games like hearthstone.
---
I see his post shows multiboxing is it viable doing it with a fleet?
---
lol
---
i absolutely have. i talk to people about this shit all the time, and they commonly bring up vietnam vets. 
---
one guy doesn't change that. if anything it proves the point that it brainwashes people
---
will you pay more for faction fort killmails? asking for a friend

For sure... Last time I ran into him we talked in local for probably 45 mins after the fight.

"Of course, when we say that we have 30,000 simulated players altogether, we don’t necessarily mean that you would see a crowd of 30,000 characters on your screen, should you mount on top of a hill and watch the players down there. We have mechanisms to cut the number of visible entities on your screen, to account for both client rendering limitations and server bandwidth. "
---
It is all just fluff, smoke, and mirrors.
---
Citadels were a huge mistake
---
TRItards gayish romance exposed, mighty Arrow is missed being mentioned (corrected). 
---
Thats probably why Aether are going for the 10K real players.
---
Aether already did the test. Was like 4k real players and  8k simulated
---
Your 1 million isk T1 frig is a 31 mil isk T1 frigate + loot after you do the site. You wouldn't feel so smart after you lose a few hundred mil in loot to a gank that might be easily survivable by an astero.

I've brought up a list of issues to CCP while on CSM 12 and CSM 13. Most of that was from a thread I made on the forums, Asterothi's podcast, the New FC document, blog posts and discussions I made and from the cross faction discord channel. Both times CCP was really receptive and thought most of the ideas were good and worth investigating. The Problem is that if FW is not on the roadmap then it sort of ends at 'this is something we want to do, unfortunately we don't have the resources to do this' 
---
Uhm... Explain whats the issue, pls...?
---
They are already planning on more, And in better time zones to get more people
---
You're talking about grinding that's been what you and I really don't like. That's like saying you don't like first person shooters because you played a game that was kind of an FPS but was a grind fest that we're seeing in games today to keep people busy. 
---
It is possible to isolate what works and extract that from elements that kill the system. I don't play Elite very much, but it's popularity is growing and Eve's is shrinking. It's why they made a free to play model, easier skill gains, no skill loss, added the agency to help new players play.
---
I'm an older player that's trying to get back into Eve and it's... Boring. I am activity trying to get back into Eve, I'm trying to get some of my friends to play Eve, the promotional videos and the stories that cone from Eve are amazing. Eve has to compete against other games with better arenas, cross platforming, easier to pick up, depth and impact with NPC interactions, other factional conflicts, and more diverse sets of interactions. 
---
If you're goal is to kill Eve, make sure it stays the same. Make sure new players aren't welcome. Make sure it offers nothing more than what many sandbox games start off with. An empty sandbox requiring all content to be generated by players, without allowing players to generate meaningful content.
---
lol history is everything, You can ignore whatever you want to prove your own agenda, but remember, everyone else can do the same. Sounds like a good conversation to me.   
---
Can you please take this somewhere else? I made this thread and it's supposed to be about the Eve Community, and not about your hero worship agenda. Go make your own thread to discuss this please.
---
&gt;You wouldn't feel so smart after you lose a few hundred mil in loot to a gank that might be easily survivable by an astero
---
Did it literally hundred times, got ganked only once. In terms of isk/h it's actually much better exactly because you don't really care about your ship. Good loot? Warp, can, back. If you're running C1 wh sites through the HS static it gives you a shitload of money in just a couple of hours with almost zero risk.
---
You do realize nobody in EVE actually gives a fuck, right? We're here to shoot, backstab, scam and insult each other in ways most vile.
---
Your misplaced morals do not belong here. Either move on to the next game, get used to it or make sure we don't find out what your main is and make you regret spensing any time being a special snowflake at all.
---
From what it sounds like there was no interacting even with the visible ones.  Its kinda weird to only count "player count" when to a server the number of players isn't as important as the number of physics entities which also includes stuff like missiles, drones and fighters in eve.  It was nice that they at least acknowledged that in the article however.
---
They don't Rorqs can't enter Highsec yet :P.
---
CrAcKs FoRmInG
---
If not can they at least open up the tools for public use on Sisi?
---
good question
---
2x fort kills inc.. 
---
I'll poke for my money soon :)
---
&gt;Everyone will either be asleep, at work, or in school.
---
Its genius actually. Less nerds to fend off.
---
I’m more confused as to why someone supposedly so high up in tnt needs to put out a public contract for structure bashing....why not just rally the imperium and do it yourself Hyde?
---
I can say it had very little impact compared to the millions of plex that marketeers are hording to drive the price up. 
---
Only person that can kill NSH is themselves, friend
---
Well the good news is that FRCD finally left TNT. Useless corp.
---
iirc his CCP tag is CCP Hellmar, his real name is Hilmar though, so you're partially right :)
---
Supreme executive power derives from a mandate of the masses, not some farcical aquatic ceremony. I mean, if I went around declaring myself Emperor just because some moistened bint threw a scimitar at me, they’d lock me away.
---
Au contraire! There already WAS a pirate infestation *before* PDAs were installed. The more pirates you kill, the deeper you reach towards their bigger bases... So I'd argue, the less PDAs you have, the more pirates should be a problem!
---
Thank you for your tax revenue.
---
What do you mean
---
Also, if you got those logs of those imperium alts, y'know, I'll take em. I won't pay you or anything.
---
It's at 13:00 local time in iceland, so during the working day, so I suppose it was planned like that because it's during the day.
---
Anyways, if you have some very important questions, my lectures end at 13:30 EVE time tomorrow, so I'll be happy to ask your questions for you.
---
Confused. Are Jews ineligible for the free sp?
---
GeeeTAH
---
Hyde handles his own shit and he likes it that way.
---
I have extensive logs detailing the smuggled supers/titans including being asked to stand down NC 2x from ganking these TNT titans in Cloud Ring as they were being smuggled out and sold to NSH members (a panfam-aligned entity).
---
I love seeing piece of shit traitors get what they deserve, if anyone from Imperium Command wants, I can get give you all the logs and screenies that you need to brand this traitor lining his personal wallet.
---
Are you coming back to EvE Bobmon? 
---
No way then my 15 years of Eve has been a lie, I will create a ticket to Eve support and see what they think.
---
Canned bubble will catch you anyway. Speed matters. Skill matters. Cloak helps a bit but that's it. You can't loot the can cloaked.
---
CAS guy here. We are a socialist/anarchist NPSI collective living in Syndicate, primarily composed of characters in the CAS NPC noob corp. We informally call ourselves the CAS Combat Guild. We use that noobcorp membership to introduce new players to nullsec life. We focus on whatever an individual wants to do. Primarily PvP but also missions and mining and exploration light industry. We have no leaders, but we do have people who organize activities that other people join in on. Our signature event is the CAS Combat Day we run every six weeks, where we get a group of sixty or so pilots, many of whom never ventured into null or PvPed, and roam around the null and low neighborhood looking for fights. 
---
We’ve been in Syndicate for over 10 years. We’ve survived a lot of aggressors. Not won against, but we endure. Living in NPC null is of course a big part of that, but we also have a resilience and mutual support level I don’t often read about in other groups. Players come and go and often come back or at least keep in touch. We try to mostly remain polite with the people we encounter. We have absolutely nobody set blue. 
---
We also have an actual player alliance and player corp for doing things that need those, like the AT. We’ve participated for several years, and for the past two we were even allowed to use our NPC corp mains. We did well. Got a lot of SKINs.
---
In addition to the Syndicate based CAS Combat Guild there’s also the CAS Mining Alliance which mostly operates in highsec. There’s a small wormhole group that I don’t know much about. 
---
Thanks for paying for our content! So nice!
---
Which after the price rework, will cost you now 6bil.
---
So you think they bought them all up over the few days then dumping them at the higher price?
---
NSH deploying to Provi...wut?
---
Why?
---
ye who shall be blapped did not roll of the tongue very well xD
---
poke me on discord
---
..... by contracting it out and not doing it himself?
---
&gt; Astero is tanky enough to fight other explorers, but not much else.
---
They're better than that. In terms of combat power they fall between the navy faction frigs and the other pirate faction frigates. They dominate against any T1 frigate. They'll win more often than not against the navy faction frigs or against T1 destroyers. But, against the other pirate faction frigates they'll usually lose.
---
Im curious how you were able to communicate so well with NSH since they are all Russian. Care to elaborate on that? Also do you plan to put a contract out for their LSH brothers? 
---
U seem mad. Maybe take anger management classes?
---
His four rep Ninazu was a thing of beauty.  Emphasis on was.
---
Did INIT ever get that $75,000 for cleaning out HK? 
---
No idea.
---
Meant armageddon not apoc. Opps
---
Yeah, it’s better ^^
---
Everyone in Imperium Command love logs, send me the links in a pm.
---
Create a support ticket, they *should* be able to help you out.
---
nice
---
My geuss is someone opened a cyno beacon to the public as bait. Then named the beacon “fleet cyno” to trick pilots into jumping to it to die.
---
I'm guessing you have to be omega status before logging in to claim the additional sp and you won't get them even if you were subbed but lapsed to alpha before the promotion date?
---
"please log in"
---
&gt; I allowed a few LSH members access to my alt renter corp to help them make ISK 
---
Both LSH and White Sky have lvl5 agents, what could they possibly looked for, aside from your stuff on their killboard?
---
&gt;:shocking: 
---
Indeed.
---
Why not using Eve online discord, would be easier to follow.
---
We keep talking about this shit since forever, without CCP there isn't any fix.
---
Garst is love
---
&gt; Citadels in general were a mistake
---
imo the idea of citadels wasn't bad, however, CCP should've stuck to POS/POCO timers (for medium sized structures) and similar timers to flipping stations in null. As for FW space: There should be a serious drawback to holding a structure in hostile FW space, which could vary from permanent low power for structures in hostile space to being unable to dock in any structure in hostile space to diamond NPC's from the hostile faction bashing your structures in their space. Damage caps are stupid though. Also, make resists scale with ADM in nullsec. That's all.
---
Thanks, I'll give this a go. Sounds better than my plan. 
---
07
---
This has happened many times...Garst comes, Tri returns to greatness, expands, gets gud fights, flourishes etc under Garsts iron fist.
---
Garst attempts to delegate, brings on "lesser" leaders, e.g Pat, Shariah (no offense). Lesser leaders get power hungry attempt to take more responsibility, Garst being a benevolent God grants it. Lesser leaders are significantly worse at fleet basics (like Target calling) fleets start to die. Lesser leaders point fingers at line members. Good line members start to leave cause they don't like the politics. Garst has to redeploy, leaves alliance in the hands of lesser leaders. Within months Tri collapses. Garst comes back, rinse repeat.
---
Garst IS Triumvirate/No.Mercy. without him not only being around, but being a total dictator it always wanes.

this is funny af because ive had to deal with both groups in the past year and i still recklessly juggle their names about
---
&gt;Im curious how you were able to communicate so well with NSH since they are all Russian
---
I just speak like Chekhov and they always seem to understand.
---
nothing
---
they spend tens of millions of failed projects biyearly, 50k aint shit
---
Rigs: 3 Shield extenders
---
Medium: Afterburner, Target Painter, Medium Shield extender, mission specific shield hardener
---
Lowslots: 2 Ballistic Control Systems (alternatively 1 Nanofiber Internal Structure, 1 Ballistic Control System)
---
You'll be quick enough to barely take any damage at all in missions and even get away if it becomes unmanageable. Orbit at 15km, focus on the small fry first and work your way up. The same mindset behind this build could also be used for the Corax. Note that Acceleration Control is also a recommended skill for this build. I wouldn't go with Shield Power Relays or Shield Rechargers on a Frigate, since their contribution is negligible and there are other modules which provide better utility.
---
In my opinion the shield rechargers and shield power relays start to make sense on Battlecruisers.
---
this....
---
wtf are you talking about. wtf is a canned bubble. your speaking jiberish here bro. speed irrelevant. skill irreverent. knowledge is what you need.
---
I'll but it this way... if you're flying an astero and you either manage to gank someone that drops 50M worth of loot, you escape with 50M worth of loot that you might have otherwise lost, or you just chase someone else off of a site that you want for yourself, or you even hack a valuable can that you might have otherwise failed on without the +10 hacking bonus, then flying an astero would have made you more than flying T1, replacement costs included.
---
Atom Deathstroke.  That fucked has been following me in local every god damn system!
---
bro stop. you have no idea what your talking about.
---
YES HELLO, I LOVE ME A GOOD BLUESHOOT. LET'S GO.
---
TEST doesn't exist. It's a conspiracy!
---
The PR value of the CSM existing is probably worth more than that. 
---
None. You assume that eliminating the CSM wouldn’t be a loss in value. 
---
Ooh this is great. My alpha is a few days off "max alpha" 75000sp might just make it.
---
Roughly how many sp can you train in 24hrs omega?
---
I just want a tournament-style expansion that offers Agents who offer a primitive matchmaking to pair you with other people with similar "Cost of Clone + Ship." The more expensive your bout, the more LP/ISK you get in return.
---
This would be ideal for me, but it'll never happen.
---
I've always enjoyed watching others burn as I sit back and sip tea. 
---
Anything? Name a decision you made personally that paid off in game.
---
If everyone can start sending me 1 isk so bob here can send the logs that would be appreciated. 
---
Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. You can't expect to wield supreme executive power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!

You need to prove the business model to them. Show that it won’t just be fun, but it will increase subscriptions. 
---
Sack up and do the AMA here.
---
It is literally a 1 year hiatus. It isn't gone forever, and they said as much when they announced the cancellation this year.
---
Howdy! Yeah we did a roundtable. Bout time for another one. The problem I ran into was ensuring I was providing a balanced view for the podcast, that meant extra sheep and ultimatly the 4 factions didn't have equal interest in participating in the podcast.
---
I do strongly support this new inititive and will do what ever I can to help!
---
nice, thanks for the overview!
---
i dont think ive ever known anyone around me to care
---
Daw you're too kind
---
IKR? Hunters farm people doing exactly that.
---
You don't have a phone?

this is getting even better xD
---
Corax is getting buffed soon too. Such am awesome ship, would recommend
---
Cold iron best iron! Great video as usual!

If by mansion you mean bum, and by dancers you mean fingers, then 2 sometimes 3.

Ask anyone that's lived in provi for any length of time how they deal with it. I suspect you'll get some useful responses.
---
Vodka cures all
---
Maybe with them deploying to Provi, CVA can make some dank isk.
---
put up another one and get in rollers this time
---
roll connections away 
---
We were planning to do this anyhow, and now we get to be paid for it!?!?! What a day to be alive.
---
Just don't use an impel coz it's too big with a plate 
---
Who's the 'They' you're talking about?
---
The shareholders, who have been bought out and (in most part) aren't at all involved any more?
---
Hey man, shit happens, without losses achievements aren't worth much either. Take some time to recover from your loss, then try again! 
---
A word of advice: mass-crit your own static and be on the lookout for other wormholes, crit (and preferably close) those as fast as possible to avoid a repeat of what happened. Good luck!

Ive lost nearly 10 bil in ratting ships within a week, I've nearly been evicted from my home at between a rock and a hard place, hell this week my corp had been conducting an eviction with 24 hour hole control just to lose it after hours of rage rolling to keep pospy, tdsin, pggb, and naphe out. It will happen, and it sucks. Best thing to do is learn from your mistakes and do better next time.
---
I sometimes have bad judgement too.
---
&gt;Titans = 15B   
---
what race? 
---
I got scammed for 15 billion trying to pay to have someone's super killed. Long and in the end funny story, tl;dr it was an elaborate scam and the guy i paid the isk to was actually the alt of the person I wanted killed.
---
Had to accept it and own it, and i managed to get him to send 1.5 billion to the Eve Radio manager with the message "10% of the isk i scammed from \[me\]". A day or 2 later i went live on air giving the full details of how it all went down, and we all had a good laugh at my expense. And then that 1.5 bil was given out as prizes that night to listeners, so at least something came of it.
---
At the time tho, i sent the isk and got the PM "sry dude, hop on TS" and its just a "well fuck...." that sinking feeling, thats a month or 2 of time and effort earning that isk gone in a few seconds etc. 
---
I handled it like "i'll laugh about this some day" to "no, ill laugh about this tomorrow!" and threw it out to the world, and a fun story it was indeed, and i still look back and laugh about it with friends from time to time. End of the day, its a game, i knew the risk and i took it, might as well make the best of it :)
---
They're American...
---
You're an idiot. He said girls are uncommon compared to guys playing games. That is objective fact. You knowing a few doesn't mean anything... He then proceeded to say that it's not a problem, and gave a few examples of prominent eve online players who happen to be female.

And you freaked out like he was attacking you. You're gonna quit this game in less than a month because no one puts up with that type of retarded bullshit. Gl playing until you get shoved out for being an insufferable asshole. 
---
he handle his own goon fucking like that way also ? smuggling supertits for sell to panfam tut tut tut
---
ecm is terrible now after the ECM changes, so the widow is terrible
---
Well played. 
---
That's really rough man I'm sorry to hear that. But it's the risk that makes this game fun and exciting so just keep at it!
---
Very well said.
---
This is also a very good reply.
---
Or just let cits stay in null with no asset safety, remove standings requirements for manufacturing at npc stations. Keep the refineries in low/high, but as you say, if your refinery gets caught on the wrong side of fw space, then penalties abound. 
---
There is no better place to spend that money. This is one of the best things that eve does.
---
If they paid that money so somehow stop you from posting it might be an improvement.

Ships are ammo.

Found Hilmar's reddit account.

subbing 10+ accounts becomes expensive, hence subbing alt accounts with plex

I don't think the question assumes that, the word "better" automatically notes some value.

In general, most people only use Black Ops as a soccer mom. Send a CovOps frig ahead to the planned battle site. Light a CovCyno. Black Ops bridges the fleet of T3s and Recons across, and maybe comes along too? Either cloaking in place back home and waiting, or cloaking in place at the Cyno and waiting. Then the fleet of warp capable cloaky ships go off to have fun, while the redheaded stepchild stays behind. And then when everyone is ready to go home, the Black Ops drops cloak and ferries them across.
---
Once upon a time, Bombers couldn't warp cloaked either. And then CCP wised up and gave them the ability. Until they do the same for Black Ops, they will always be a liability. You see them coming from a mile away, unless it's a hotdrop situation. But there are far more lethal things to drop on someone than an overpriced minivan.
---
Do you really think there is PR value in CSM?  I think the only people who believe that are current CSM members and some Podcasters who don't want to rock the boat.
---
Why do you say that, what value do you feel they provide that could not be attained using other methods?

SHUT UP! Will you SHUT UP!

There are very few games that care so much about what their players think. Any line of direct communication between the players and the people that make the game is always a good thing.

Really? Handing out 250k SP for nothing and still too stingy to give the compensation for a broken chat to everyone who experienced problems?
---
Came here to say this. If you're going to survive in WH space, you need to learn to roll your holes asap. Especially when you're building a citadel.

The answer that i was given, it wasn't very satisfying, is that if loss hurts you are a hyper risk averse carebear.
---
50k (american) is the average salary in Reykjavik, after eliminating jobs 18 months ago, I think hiring a community manager would be value added to the game.  This person could also establish new method for gathering feedback from community subject experts, instead of the CSM which may or may not be experts in any part of the game.
---
Yeah fuck that guy
---
Where you trying to be edgy or did my question hit a nerve?
---
Hell yeh man I hear you :)
---
a while back i lost my first battleship. It was both the first battleship that I had ever flown (An Abaddon) and the first one i had ever lost. I managed to cope with the loss simply because i had two other battleships i could use in its place. 
---
My view is simply that it's the factor of loss that makes success so, so sweet.
---
What? No. CAS are good people.
---
Who?
---
&gt; The effort that it took though, turned to dust.
---
That's where you are wrong. You'll see it.

black ops BS really need to be able to cloaky warp. They are not in a good place. 
---
They nerfed ECM, which in turn made the widow almost useless outside of running 10/10 ded sites. The reason other blops are used more is because their secondary bonuses actually benefit them, but the windows do almost nothing unless you bridge a fleet, micro jump 100k off, and use an officer ECM module to whore on the kill.
---
We did. Had everything as closed as possible. They rolled their static and happened to link to ours. There were 2 sabres in there instantly. Couldn't have rolled that without a big fight, in which we would have lost more than we already did.
---
I honestly can't think a way out of the situation we had other than beat their fleet, which we couldn't.
---
Yeah, I've literally lost a few gaming friends \[death\] having been playing EvE for so long.   
---
It's much harder to lose friends than virtual assets. 
---
What I hope they release are the numbers of people who come back because of the SP and stick around, and the number of alphas that convert to Omega for this sp. You guys are so goddamned negative about what is a super basic reactivation, retention, and engagement plan. 
---
Before you leave send me your ISK and assets. 
---
then get help
---
I think pospy will babysit new wormholers for free or something 
---
This. Just get a friend with an interceptor, and probably just use a VNI instead.
---
Oof just sounds like bad luck man. Recover and go at it again. The hole life is a brutal one. But the rewards are worth it for those who can make it.
---
Wait, will you actually pay me though? 
---
The thing about groups that live in NPC space is that it's pretty much impossible to evict them. Even if you kill every last structure of them they still have NPC stations. Mostly you just kill some of their shit when they get annoying to send them a message and then you don't give a fuck about them again.
---
Which should happen soon and blame blinky
---
I LOVE YOU CYRUS
---
Typically, when you join a corp, it's going to have structures already set up.

Hey Johnny !

Sorry to hear it.

The answer is to get revenge. Build a new station. Build your corp numbers. Find the people who did this to you. Kill them, and loot everything they own.

Might take months or years, but you'll enjoy it when it's done.

Never keep more isk in a hole than what you can log out in.
---
Sweet! keep up the good work... pleasure ramming my Atrons into fights with you.
---
or just make them as good as fucking t1 battleships at tanking and killing things 
---
&gt;Everything looked good, only two hours remaining, but some dudes managed to roll into our system. And of course they saw. What was the probability of that? I wonder what the static wormhole respawn code looks like.    
---
They had eyes on almost the whole time- I guarantee it.  
---
My corp dropped 5 stations only to have the alliance fold a few months after. We're talking the permanent stations, not these temporary ones.
---
That's a good idea, and I would just try to focus on some meaningful events that you find interesting rather than pure commentary. Good luck we all need more content creators 
---
Only having a joke at usual Snuffed fleet comps for a small gang gathering.  No offence intended. 
---
I can always make more isk, its WH space. The loss of the majority of my assets wasnt the issue, it was the rebuild after that would have been the issue
---
Neuromancer X, that guy is so bad at this game
---
CCP could save the money and just buy a sub to The Meta Show. Same people, same advice for a fraction of the cost.
---
The leftover money could go towards beer and station skins.

I see nothing broken.

There's a reason Tiny(Mcav's spiritual leader) gets really fucking mad when people bitch about kill boards, losses, isk efficiency, etc.

It's literally just pixels and none of it matters. Attachment to ships, pods, structures, etc etc will make this game a hell of a lot less fun for you in the long run.

People like to shit talk us saying we whelp, but then say we're also have really good individual pilots, fleet comps, etc etc. You'd be surprised what fun you can have when you literally dont care.

Any idea where? I work for Apple so now i'm curious. 
---
This is true for how much the hull is it really needs some more sustain ability on field. I think they were trying to avoid fleet doctrines of blops ships. Cause having 100-300 battle ships that can jump into a system, anchor up and tank like a regular battle ship, then jump out if in trouble is pretty stinking OP. 
---
Then why comment on it?
---
Esports need repetitive predictable gameplay you can perfect. Eve pvp beyond 1v1 is not that.
---
i wanted hire  suicide ganker to  kill  friend  skiff. he wanted me to give him 3 talos with polarized guns,guess what happened..... if not ill tell - he took the ships and  blocked me  :D thankfully i didnt give him   polarized blasters,they are  expensive ,he just got empty hulls
---
You get 250k SP for free which is worth quite a lot when you use an extractor and that's half the SP you didn't have to use training time/PLEX for.

That sounds cool!

Unless you use safe logout, your ship stays in space for 30 seconds. Or longer if you have combat timers active. If you did this, then yes, someone can tackle you while your ship is in space before it logs you out.
---
If you successfully use the safe logout, then you are 100% logged out and can't be shot.
---
reading is your friend. 
---
I mean 50k is chump change so probably.
---
Who even cares? There's nothing good to put skills into anyhow, bc everyone just skill injects 250K is almost offensive. And plus, logging in isn't worth playing with how unbalanced the game is. It's just a bunch of Supercapitals ruining everyone's fun, especially faction warfare which is dead. CCPs just trying to distract us from how awful everything about EVE is.

Come on, reddit is not a reliable forum. Its full of trolls. Literally no one important ever had an AMA on reddit. Shit imagine what would happen if people like Elon Musk, Bill Gates or even fucking Obama would do an AMA on reddit? COULD YOU IMAGINE?

Now that B4R posts are disallowed it's safe to assume this is in the context of the game. Especially since it specifically says "loss in EVE".
---
Brave is pretty chilled out, fun people, loads of content around our space as people always stop by for a good fight, loads of fun to be had. There isn’t really any mandatory fleets or anything so you can do anything you like pretty much, but all fleets in general are pretty fun.
---
when i still played it was str4nnik and penifmash's horde alt. cant remember the name..
---
&gt;We use them to shoot carriers (jam the fighters) because then you make the carrier waste his MWD cycle on his fighters to go after your widow which can just warp, come back and start the process over again. 
---
Or you can just use a Falcon for \~10% of the cost. 
---
No disrespect, but the Widow is now on par with a cruiser class ship that costs a fraction of the price. And that's a damn shame.
---
Such is the price of ostentation.
---

I mean, the EvE uni guys in PC9 don't do anything outside of station games anyways.

Typically, if the corp leaders are not stupid, they will use a holding corp (or transfer existing structures to it), so the main corp can't be wardec'd.

---
Blops are a long skill train and cost billions of isk for a ship that is basically on par with, or maybe slightly ahead of, T3Cs and recons. Except T3Cs and recons cost a fraction of the price, have more maneuverability, and are arguably less risky.
---
Lost a super a while ago. My bro and i mafe effort for around 6 months while also having bits of other things in game. I was the one to fly it, took care to fit for the best for 23B of isk. Not even taken out of KS before fitting it to the last faction/deadspace module. Then tried to learn super ratting for a week at small windows of 15-40 minutes at times. My fighters were getting too much damage, so i lost a fighter almost every haven i did, witht he result of no profit that week. Then i finally accepted to try warping to sun and ejecting my pod just to enter the ship a minute later. **IT WORKED, I WAS AMAZED.** Later that day i lost it 10 minutes before downtime in a spy situation.
---
Hurt like hell, hurts like a real life situation becauze it was one nice objective to keep determined for 6 months and it went up in smokes in a week without any return.
---
Yet it made the game more meaningful now that i gave up simple ~~power~~ crabbing creep, especially with recent fighters change and plex prices. Isk doesnt really mean much anymore.
---
Huh, then none of the corps I'm aware of are run by smart leaders.
---
What's wrong Hunter?  U mad 14 year old girls are not accepting isk payments anymore?  
---
U mad bro? Did the 14 year old girls stop taking your isk?
---
I make public contracts to haul my stuff around my fw staging systems. Can I start a thread?
---
People are pissy about groups bring content?
---
surely you're on 10.0 by now :\^)
---
My coping mechanism was to just step away from the game. I love EVE. It's well established, has a great player base, and lots of different things to do. It requires time however, something of which I have in short supply. It takes me ages to earn ISK so losses hurt. I could spend real money on PLEX to get the ISK back quickly, but I don't want to.
---
In the end, I find myself playing a few hours a month as an Alpha which allows me to enjoy the game with lowered expectations.
---
Long story short, set your expectations but be ready for loss. 
---
Yeh man thanks for the fights :) I always expect a tough one against yourself.
---
I made a post questioning the CEO's decision regarding a request of mine in a forum section that was inappropriate for that sort of discussions.
---
Wasn't it so single expanded cargohold allowed for one more large/medium (don't remember now) container in cargo that effectively increased your effective cargo space even more?
---
I'm leaving my current Corp and have ships in my current corp's engineering facility. Can I lose my ships or can they do anything with my assets that are there?
---
Sin more versatility
---
Probably meant they were Concordokkened
---
It would only make sense that you are as useless and the rest of your alliance.
---
Signature Radius.  How low do I have to get it before combat probes cannot get a full lock on me? I can get my T3C down to 1.358 according to Pyfa.  I've heard references to it needing to be down to 1.08 before it can be pretty much unscannable.  Is that accurate?
---
As long as you don't shoot people in lowsec, you won't be losing sec status, and getting 0.0 to 5.0 by belt ratting across entire constellation takes maybe 5-6 hours single time. It's not that hard if you, say, use dread alt for blopsing.
---
also very wrong
---
:(
---
yes lmao
---
You can definitely put up a bubble to interrupt his e-warp, or just tackle him the normal way, if you're quick enough to get there before he enters warps. If he does get into warp he'll land one million km away in a random spot and despawn immediately, unless he's got a timer, in which case you can probe him down and kill him while he's offline. His pod will attempt to e-warp as well when it's released, same million km in a random direction.
---
Wow, I did not know that. Thanks for correcting my sad attempt at a joke

For now Widow makes sense when supporting small capital drops against solitary supers. With single Apostle/Ninazu on grid armor Widow is able to easily tank a super, and having bonused ECM available means said super has very hard time doing any harm to however few dreads you bring to kill it (remember dreads can't get remote reps when in siege). Outside this one specific niche it's now for all intents and purposes just much worse Marshal.
---
You should tell that to someone who gives a fuck :)
---
Hey mate, gonna keep it real with ya. This is pretty gay and retarded but dont worry, I'll still suck your toes anytime you wanna stop by PFP, ya feel?

If you want a big social group that is ok with people posting unfortunate things occasionally then Test is probably the best one.
---
Goons come from Something Awful forums originally which was a community with high posting standards. While the Eve Goons are much more relaxed than old school SA there's still possibly something of that in their culture. (I got a warning on a SA-related site for missing a full stop at the end of a sentence).
---
TEST are pretty committed to free speech which means that you'll sometimes see people posting things which are offensive. I fly with Test because I'm fine with that.
---
Brave had for some time a standard that promoted kindness and being nice. That meant that sometimes they cracked down on behaviour that would be tolerated elsewhere.
---
I believe Pandemic Horde is also pretty laid back.
---
I'm a little out of the loop but those are the historical traits of those major groups.

You bring your carebear attitude into non-carebear territory and get, rightfully, punished. Maybe you have a traitor amongst your "bro corpmates."

I explained several times already where the cyno jams are located in FW systems. Outside and inside of plexes. Carrier can still cyno somewhere close and warp to the plex. But if that cruiser activates the acceleration gate and enters a medium plex then the carrier can't follow.
---
I paid 7b for 3 T2 adaptive invuls. The pain never goes away. You just continue on like someone died and it slowly gets easier. Also I only fly armor now.
---
This is all gold
---
That would be a sight to behold tho
---
ICY has been selling off large amounts since this started, and so far it hasn’t had a huge effect. Either whoever created this price hike is buying him out, or demand for plex even at current prices is big enough that it’s just going to keep going up until some sales happen

CSM aren't supposed to be experts in the game, they're supposed to be a pipeline between the player base and the devs. 
---
They're not elected to go fix the game and get your pet project implemented. This isn't Congress, they don't have any authority and you don't get any pork. They're elected so that they can advocate for things from a player perspective and to be a sounding board for devs to float ideas and get constructive feedback.
---
Truthfully from someone who is a bit of a mogul in this game...the best line of defense you can have is a backup plan. Talk to your Corp mates next time and plan for multiple scenarios. What it sounds like to me is you were overconfident and not cautious enough. Yeah you rolled the holes but you can't plan for RNG on hole rolling. So think to yourself...what could I have done differently that would have made it so I don't feel this way again? Make some friends in game that have a bigger army? Saved double the isk in the event it does die you can immediately online another? Put up a fight defending what you worked so hard for? Maybe that would have impressed them into asking you to join them in an alliance? Who knows but one thing is for sure...planning in this game is if vital importance if you want to be successful and trust no one. How long did it take init to evict hard knocks and kill the first keepstar ever built? Over a year...plan plan you ass off and keep it to only the people you absolutely trust then put everything to action. Take this as a learning lesson and build from there...

Are you surprised CCP uses their own game forum for an AMA? looking at the state of this sub full of epic memers, shitposters and bitter ex players it would turn any thread into a cesspit on the same scale as 4chan.
