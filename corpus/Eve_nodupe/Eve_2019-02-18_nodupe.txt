So let's say a cyno beacon can only support 5 Caps every 15min and a Cyno can only support 3 Caps until it collapses (this is a retarded idea BTW) every cap that jumps would just light another cyno.

---
---
There isnt enough pvp content for me to justify playing this game when i could play literally any other game not to mention the incompetence of the devs or the fact that they balance the game 2 times a year if you're lucky
---
Do I look like a crab? He comes in a room making bold claims and fails to bring any evidence and then tells me to find that evidence myself? Thats like the definition of sperging.
---
Yea Thailand is definitely not the best place to get a tattoo. I got it done in Singapore
---
i think it is more of a ccp csm problem.... lets try to get rid of the goon csm and mabye we see it get beter.
---
ITT:  People who fail to understand the problem with declining players who probably stopped contributing financially to CCP long ago.    Either fight for balance and change,   or continue to ensure that the game will eventually fuck itself over because you want to feel elite in some element of your life. 
---
Problem is is that there are no wars atm, so probably everyone with proper TZ presence will jump on it.
---
No, you don't get to be the representative for CCP. You are a representative of the community and what you're doing is watering down the argument of a member of the community "their hands are tied"...
---

---
Establishing a roadmap is something they've introduced in the past, now they've retracted it. Its a conditioned response, if the argument you put forward was correct then we'd be asking for the introduction of a roadmap not a continenounce. 
---
Interaction with devs and games happens throughout the industry, Facepunch for example allow community run server owners to have direct access to Devs to help combat security breaches and bans etc. To argue "CCP is the special snowflake" is not a correct appeal to authority, it just inflates the proxy-apology. 
---
Your role is to advocate for the best interest of the community this week, sit down with them and make change happen on behalf, not be their apology / defense mechanism. They need to own this themselves, your role in this equation is to unpack what the root cause for such a concern is and advocate for the best interest of the OP - not "you're wrong, everything is fine considering" which is the summary of your response.
---
You've had 15mins introduction to CCP's back / dev ecosystem, you're not a developer, you've never run a gaming community and at best you've built equity in your "fame" through advocation of the little guy. You don't get to turn the tables now you have a backstage pass.
---
Stay in your lane.
---
&gt;The community also has a ridiculously long memory
---
&gt;But people never seem to remember when something is promised and then delivered upon.
---
Hmmmmm
---
big bill tha beta
---
I'm based on pretty much the other side of the globe from SoCal.. If you're ever in Singapore, I'll buy you a beer.
---
how is this a slap fight the guy was getting trolled the entire time?
---
your corporation should be doing this for you, if they don't then they are not a good corporation and you should find someplace else. 
---
post it or it didn't happen, that's how proof works. And im sure if he really did take down GOTG all by himself then he would post it immediately  but he hasn't so please do us the honours.
---
Just to give you an example of slendering I am talking about:  
---
[https://i.imgur.com/CO88dMS.png](https://i.imgur.com/CO88dMS.png)  
---
Now I finally get something for that claim that marshy was baned unjustified.. and I can only stress once more how picky and biased this whole story is:   
---
"Join in on this shit posting. Upvote (if you wish) and lets get more members !!" is something you consider brigading? He told them they can upvote if they wish, he didn't command them to, not even speaking of making them in any way.  
---
Knowing rules are enforced so strictly, I am very keen on seeing these two people above banned.. one of them beeing a mod.  
---
Maybe you should check if someone went around you and banned him.. because that is exactly that seemed to have happend.
---
plz no
---
and they cost like 25 bucks...
---
Well, the best fun I had was hauling packs from the east land mass to the west.  Best payout and it could be pirated anytime.  The ocean was amazing and the castle system was pretty good too IMHO.

Hm? I don't play EA games. Didn't realize people still do.

It happens more than you think. That's one corp and a single init stuka gank of which they several more so far this year. No one is saying that taking out caps is a no effort dunk, and it shouldn't be. But if you use actual tactics and take out a fleet put together with the intention of hunting caps you can kill them.
---
You just want to solo my nyx in a t1 heron, ITS A CAPITAL SHIP.
---
‘missed a drop* because it was just too good not to carry this conversation on with him.’     
---
‘the guy was getting trolled the entire time’ 
---
*Thinking. 
---
What do the various colors mean when another ship shows up on the Overview? I've seen green, orange, red and purple. Sometimes they also have an icon (I think a green star means they're in my corp?) Any kind of guide to the various good/bad/neutral statuses would be helpful here.
---
It’s true. Memory for negative things is huge, memory for kept is short term. 
---
I was trolling him, do you know what trolling means or did your overlords not teach you that?
---
Of course he didn't do it himself.  He can definitely lay some claim to paving the way, though, and GOTG were certainly putting a lot of blame on him, loudly.   Were you not around last year or something?
---
Actually very good post, and good way to back up your point with references.
---
I think the difference between hunting down capitals with a fleet like that, versus entering null with the intent to create a bit of chaos is that the fleets that create a bit of chaos have no real answer to the "Here comes three caps"
---
Personally why I choose to play more in wormhole space than anywhere else now.    My problem is that the game is slowly losing subscriber numbers and those it has are steadily relying more and more on in game currency to fund their accounts - it's not a good news story longer term
---
The difference between a T1 Heron and 10 Kikimoras shouldn't really be in question here.
---
CSM summit starts on monday
---
https://twitter.com/EveOnline/status/1096134662219616257
---
so hopefully they give us answers.   otherwise it will just get worse
---
Its funny how you reacted exactly how I predicted it: you don't give any proper prove, your only "prove" is just objectivly not what you said it was and questionable in terms of content. Instead you've started to harass me.   
---
QED, I think you are not qualified for the job of a moderator in this subreddit, who made you that?
---
Me on a sub cap alt. So wouLd many Other "alts".
---
Not everyone wants to rat/mine on every account 
---
#SHOTS FIRED
---
It seems to me that the csm vote is a popularity contest, and the people on it are there to muffle the screeching of a community upper management aren't particularly interested in listening to. 
---
I'll just put this fire with the other fire. 
---
We're in a weird state where the last big promise, stargates, just got delivered. The next roadmap item of similar scale is the 64-bit client, but that doesn't have nearly the gameplay ramifications. I can't think of a single other major feature publicly on the roadmap.
---
From a player perspective, it looks like the road literally just disappeared in front of us.
---
CCPlease is a nice touch, but the items on it look really like KLO items rather than initiatives (lol) befitting an actively developed product.
---
The ball is squarely in CCP's court to give us something that's going to capture the imagination for the next several months while they work on it. Maybe it's an abyssal tournament system? Maybe it's mining revamp? Maybe it's cat ear titans? Maybe it's maybeline?
---
Only CCP can know, but until they tease us, we're gonna get upset like a neglected lover.
---
I'm not representing CCP. I'm explaining this problem as I see it. I want transparency, but I also recognize when transparency can be a bad thing. I had the same issue when I was in government - you can't be 100% transparent all the time, because folks tend to want to eat the sausage, not watch it being made. 
---
Yes, they've put out roadmaps before, and those roadmaps invariably change and folks start screaming about where the promises made are. That doesn't mean they won't keep doing roadmaps - I expect to see the new one tomorrow - but folks need to keep in mind why these guys might be hesitant to put stuff up given how they've been burned by it in the past. 
---
I didn't say CCP was a special snowflake. I said CCP provides more opportunities for regular players (not the special ones you pointed out in other communities) to interact with developers than any other game I've seen. 
---
I don't need a lecture on my role or the role of the CSM. I know what my role is and I've been doing it. That I am trying to point out the difficulties the community team has when they're trying to communicate and directly response to OP's point doesn't make me an apologist. I am merely sympathizing with the folks who have to do this job, because it's not easy. 
---
You seem to think that if I present an idea once, CCP is going to just up and do whatever I tell them. They don't. We all have to keep pushing for ideas for them to get addressed. It took the CSM three years of pushing to get Wardecs to the front of mind. It's going to take me and others continually pushing to get FW looked at because that's generally what it takes to make significant change. 
---
This is what I do in my day job, too - it takes years of pushing to get stuff enacted into law, no matter how good the idea is or how important it is. Breaking through the clutter and convincing folks that something needs to be done isn't easy. 
---
Yes, I advocate for the players. And I'll keep doing that. But I am also going to be fair and point out when I think folks are being overly hard on CCP. You'll notice I've not said one thing about all the griping about the Gala Guardian event. That was completely legitimate. 
---
I wonder what its like to build something unique and wonderful, sell it, watch it literally turn to shit.
---
Though skill injectors, thats all you ccp, all you.
---
there is no way in hell you can approaches a aircraft carrier with a conventional forces the air superiority that it provide will sink/incapacitate your fleet long before that, than you have to destroy the fleet that protect him that will fuck you up with missile and canon shot with in 40km range.... unless some how you sneak a sub paste the protection fleet and lunch one torpedo but even than you just lost your sub !
---
in eve.. well a roaming fleet wont be able to destroy a capital ship before it as clear the escort well if escort it has.  
---
&gt;   My problem is that the game is slowly losing subscriber numbers and those it has are steadily relying more and more on in game currency to fund their accounts - it's not a good news story longer term
---
Agreed, but at this point I think that has more to do with CCP stonewalling on what is planned for the year and recent events being complete shit than anything else. The issues driving people away from the game at the moment have more to do with CCP's handling of communicating what they are planning, a lack of trust to handle bots and future patches and a growing presence of typical shitty MMO content specifically lootboxes and a never ending pile of ship skins, and less with where the game is right this second.
---
To be fair, that helps the creator prevent low-effort websites from ripping their video through embedding so that they can get views directly on their video page (which would gain potential subs they wouldn't get if the video was just embedded [cause generally people are lazy and don't care enough to check the channel out usually])
---
That would be easily fixed too - bring in mobile cyno jammers that can be fit to Frigate/Destroyer level ships with 1000km Radius.    That idea has been around since 2013. 
---
CSM should be axed and cannot be taken seriously, its player represenatity is just a joke.
---
Lol. GOONBTW. 
---
unless its bombbar than well nothing can really withstand 50 coverops bomber warping in and out... the escort fleet would be destroy in less than a min or two than the cap pilots cry watching billions burst into flame of salt
---
&lt;3
---
Killing is irrelivent. Short-term money is what they care about, everything else (including the death if eve) is a side effect.
---
Prawn farming... is that a meme or real thing? Serious question
---
You guys are real salty you're not making a dent in goons aren't you.
---
"Sneak past the protection fleet"
---
That's exactly my point, fella.    Capitals don't need a protection fleet,  they are the protection fleet.   That's a gameplay breaker that has no correlation in any military history.
---
The AT is for high skilled(both player and character)pilots with a lot of isk backing them up.  It has no effect on you playing your game besides being a goal for you in the future.
---
Skill injectors are one of the causes of cap proliferation, which are here to stay.  In lots of ways this is good for you because as a new player it will allow you to get into more things faster than you would have been able to in the past.  The injectors will let you "catch up" tot he rest of Eve.
---
Like you said, just make friends and try new things out.  I think you said you were in Horde, which is cool.  Just join fleets, talk to people, and have fun.  Don't worry about the Alliance Tournament or some guy shit posting about how he just biomassed.  
---
That would be useful against real afk botters.
---
The problem right now is cynos. Until you fix those allowing an unlimited stream of support, you can't fix anything. 
---
Lol look at this idiot who doesn’t know who bigbillthaboss is

---
how are we salty in any way? lol
---
I moved to NPC delve because its easy content 23/7. I have no intention of "putting a dent in goons" i'll leave that to the big alliances.
---
No Mar5hy did not send me because the goon mods decided to ban him for posting a pretty standard reddit thread.
---
Here is my official response as a goon diplomat.
---
Cat Ears - SoonTM
---
Yes, to CCP Stonewalling what is planned but also mostly because we've effectively gotten into a situation where being part of the mega corporations (such as yours) is a way to easily gain access to ISK with little to no risk owing to fundamentally broken gameplay mechanics that haven't been fixed since capital fleets became common. 
---
The bots (of which Goonswarm has plenty) are effectively protected by gameplay mechanics that ensure they have low risk.   Local Chat for instance,  put a two minute delay on local chat appearance and the bot problem gets taken out immediately,    
---
Take this thread,  this thread indicates that we should look to ways to effectively surplant the current meta of lol-cyno-lol-dread-lol-boredom of nullsec sovereignty in order to make it more interesting and attract more variety in gameplay and it gets downvoted to shit.
---
No u 
---
The game is dead. Enjoy it for what it is before they butcher it even more.
---
/u/Spysix 
---
You're getting downvoted, but that's exactly how I did it. Started doing PD on three characters to prevent this shit from happening, and I still go it occasionally. 
---
&gt; how are we salty in any way? lol
---
This thread? The earlier thread that got marshy banned bragging about a 3b loss for goons? The ungodly amount of sperg in BB discord crying about goons?
---
&gt; No Mar5hy did not send me because the goon mods decided to ban him for posting a pretty standard reddit thread.
---
Not salty but let me just ignore marshys ban evasion and blame it on goon mods, yeah right.
---
I don't disagree,  mobile cyno jammers or restrictions on total mass/total cynos available to be lit would be useful for that reason.
---
My irony detector just went off the scale.
---
&gt; "Upvote (if you wish) [..]" Hardly qualifies as brigading. WOW.
---
That is the definition of vote brigading. We went easy on you Marshy. You should have seen what we did to Amok. You know, that mainline Corp in GSF. They definitely got issued some goon mod bias, lemme tell ya.
---
&gt; you don't need to look for justification for banning someone
---
I don't need to look for justification at all if I don't want to. Unlike you though I don't lose my mind and break out into tears the moment someone criticizes me.
---
Honestly, the biggest problem I see with this is that most of the time when you fit a ship you have some sort of engagement in mind, if you just get a fit handed to you with no support like unless you have to skill to fit it you will be clueless how to use the ship. 
---
By the time you figured that out you might as well fit your own ships, it's really not a hard skill to learn. 
---
Failed bombers bar?
---
That's even larger than actual current cyno inhibs and could be spammed en masse by the first group with capitals in system
---
"Unlike you though I don't lose my mind and break out into tears the moment someone criticizes me."  
---
Which is.. EXACTLY the only thing you did, wow. Maybe you should get a bit of sleep mate, because you seem to be sleep deprived. I am not marshy. Marshy doesn't give a flying fuck about beeing spotted here, why would I if I was him? Just because I see no reason in your way of handleing the debate? Lmao.  
---
"I don't need to look for justification at all if I don't want to."   
---
What are the steps for getting you removed as a moderator then?
---
No Lmfaoo 
---
I'm training into a Carrier so I can do exactly what this guy is conplaining about. Unfairly drop onto a gang of roaming Destroyers unfairly destroying ratters. 
---
It's time for you to quit, EVE isn't the kind of game where brain dead incels like you can just farm easy kills. 
---
Go hang out on the beaches in Rust, that definitely is the kind of content you're looking for here. 
---
If a person can manage to live long enough, Theta squad will drop faxes to save a ratting myrm.
---
Meh, just do what every other logi pilot does and put drones out. 
---
Guys, we lost Delve. Everybody go play Bingo
---
CCP need to balance what's already there rather than adding more things to not iterate on
---
That's a lot of straws you're grasping at Marshy. 
---
&gt; And if the action of calling for votes in the game affect the ban in this sub.. would you also ban goons that say "I hope your mother dies in sleep today" on this platform?
---
https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy
---
Since you don't read I'll highlight it for you:
---
&gt; Asking for votes or engaging in vote manipulation
---
Lawyer all you want but you're not coming back Marshy. If the brigading continues you're going to get Amok'd. If you care about Bombers Bar at all you'd stop because eventually we're going to be left with no choice here. Might have to anyways seeing as we came down on Goons with the fury of a thousand suns and you got away with a slap on the wrist.
---
I farm easy kills all day;   I do so in FW and Wormhole space where Cynos aren't as plausible and the gameplay is a hell of a lot more fun.
---
My problem is that because of idiots like you who think your way of play is the right one,  Eve is losing subscriber counts left right and center and may soon not exist. 
---
The light fighters value is off by about a factor of 10..not including partial squads destroyed. 
---
Was a fun fight though, would do again.
---
Wish the br was right we killed 404 flights of fighters that's 32b just in fighters 
---
Of course a Test pilot would think more restrictions on Cyno was a bad idea.   
---
i am making a note of all these suggestions and instructing aryth to argue the *exact opposite* just to spite you :unsmigghh:
---
nothing
---
Please ask to disband the csm and bring back the AT
---
I've stopped EvE some weeks ago, and now I'm reading Reddit on my chair, bouncing like a drug addict. Don't stop.
---
Didn't say shit my dude, but current mobile cyno inhibitor if I recall is 150km
---
It'll make catching ratters/miners easier but actual attack/defense scenarios on anything that matters will probably be decided by who shuts the system down first with cyno inhibs if the gates are secured 
---
Which isn't necessarily awful but eh
---
LImp unhappy their dank fighter kills not showing up LOL.  
---
Why was Marshy banned from /r/eve?
---
Is it really because one of his in-game victims is/is close to a mod or is there more to this?
---
&gt; Its funny how you reacted exactly how I predicted it:
---
It's funny how you make the exact same spelling and grammatical mistakes that Marshy does.
---
&gt; QED, I think you are not qualified for the job of a moderator in this subreddit, who made you that?
---
You being the main person coming at me for being a bad mod is my single biggest defense for the opposite. You're too far up your own ass to realize that though. Do you think it's a coincidence that we let you - who is effectively a confirm marshy alt - keep posting? :thinking:

 I wonder why Marshy got banned a year ago. It also makes you think  why we ban his alts (We've banned probably a hundred marshy alts or something crazy at this point). The reason must definitely be :goonbias:.

I also didn't ban him this time, either. :P

&gt;That is the definition of vote brigading.
---
"**Vote brigading** is massively coordinated online voting. It refers to the practice of affecting reviews or scores on websites that feature [crowdvoting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing#Crowdvoting), such as online stores or review websites, by calling on large numbers of people to submit (often false) reviews, thus boosting or decreasing ratings artificially. This may be done for political reasons, for example to harm the commercial prospects and credibility of films dealing with controversial or sensitive subjects.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_brigading#cite_note-wired-1) Vote brigading is a form of [participation bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participation_bias), which can decrease the reliability of the aggregated score."   
---
Scource: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote\_brigading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_brigading)  
---
Really? Is it? Because I fail to see where Marshy told people to upvoted that post. I only see him inviting people to join in and and upvote if they wish(!!). If people wish to upvote that post out of their own conviction (because they wish so) it simply ISN'T vote brigading!   
---
It would have been vote bridading if he would have told them "I want you to upvote.", which he didn't. You seem to be not familiar with being accurate with in case of terms.   
---
If thats all what you got, I must tell you.. your ban was disproportionately and not justfied by the rules. Rebaning him is more YOU repeatedly violating the rules.
---
Your ground for this claim is extremly shaky.. just as shaky as your role as a "moderator", who seems to moderate very little and harasses people instead that speak out what you don't like to hear.  
---
So tell me, what did you do to Amok? I don't even see where this is relevant, because .. either you banned a hole corp for the actions of a few or argueably not all of them or you banned a few of them.. looking at your posts hopefully the right ones that acutally did something wrong.
---
There's a sea of other names on the list and ones no longer on the list because the reddit admins nuked the accounts. Those are just the obvious ones. He's been routinely ban evading and vote brigading for a year and is convinced it's a goon conspiracy.
---
It would add a new perspective and variation to game play beyond "Hey guys, set up your bots and make ISK in this sector of space, then have Titans, rinse and repeat"
---
I also very much enjoyed the John Wick trailer. 
---
&gt; Make cynos need to Spool up with a 5-10s delay, or ban capitals or super capitals from using weapons low sec.
---
Neither is a solution to capital issues. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/amgj7y/capital_projectioncynojump_drive_balance_three/) is an actual solution.
---
&gt; Prices of caps being cheaper than Blops and Mauraders while having high insurance safety to boot is absurd.
---
Yes but this is a double-edged issue if you are gonna make dreadbombs more expensive. Dreadbombs are one of the few ways left to kill supers/titans without n+1.
---
&gt; Bounties from rats should work like wormhole loot to make it more difficult for botters and to increase activity/content in low/high sec from big null blocs cashing in.
---
Instead of dictating where to be active by fake logististical requirements (which organically won't lead to any content btw), the focus should be on spreading out vertical farms and fixing how a couple of regions do 1/2 of all economic activity in Eve. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/9xxc8s/adaptive_anomaly_respawns_an_idea_that_would_fix/) is an idea for that.
---
In general, people who like to bitch about things are good at identifying problems but not that good at thinking about well-designed elaborate solutions to them.
---
Okay, jump no the BB coms right now and tell me that I am marshy.
---
Second
---
If you want, just ask GOTG.
---
Sure, but my main comment was just adding that it is spammable as fuck and also MUCH larger than current cyno inhibs, which isn't necessarily a bad thing if you feel it needs to be larger, I'm not really sure if they're meant to stop sov/objective based caps 
---
But the grr test attitude is pretty lame to me and I feel it's your attitude more than your content people are downvoting here
---
If it was just the players working to make it happen then sure but we both know thats bullshit. Players have done a fair bit to make it safer but ccp have aswell you really can't deny that the patchs speak for themselves.
---
The second one
---
I am hoping the CSM will ban your posting. 
---
with limited shots, and limited film. I thought this was the only valuable song that could be placed on it. Plus, the impossible dream.... a game with no bots. 
---
I cant even enter to jita lol
---
&gt;\- who is effectively a confirmed marshy alt - keep posting? :thinking:
---
Are you insane? CONFIRMED? Oh, what a shit show accusing people of something without any prove and evidence calling that "confirmed". Its hard to tell you you are not qualified as a moderator because you are not moderating when you harass people.   
---
When you just claim to have "confirmed" that they are Marshy and ban them because they are Marshy. Sure you'll have a hard time finding people that tell you you are wrong, lmao.
---
My posts are the only thing stopping you from commiting sodoku senpai while rorq mining.

I just want a legitimate roadmap for 2019. What are they *actually* working on and planning to release this year aside from annual events and “little things”?
---
As I type this, the [Updates](http://updates.eveonline.com) site has **nothing** after February. The [CCPlease](http://eveonline.com/ccplease) site lists the 64-bit client coming in summer, and ongoing chat improvements. 
---
If that’s all we have to look forward to in 2019, then I am genuinely worried. 
---
Eve is the one mmo that actual forces you to rely on people.
---
" should i ask a goon diplomat? " Or maybe just wait for the summit to start... The different CSM members have been posting on reddit quite regularly since the election if you were paying attention. 
---

Templar I's are lets say 3m a piece. So 9 per squad times 404 flights. That comes out to 11b. Assuming another few hundred were lost pulling partial squads (I know I saved at least 3 partial squads). I would estimate 15b in fighter losses.

Step4: repeat steps 1-3.

It was a good choice, it fits well with the ships doing their thing like a shoal. 
---
Movement of squads of faster-moving ships on an anchor around a target often makes me think of an orchestral conductor where the tip of their baton would be where the ships were chasing after, so the backing track to impossible dream really plays into that.

there the fact to that aircraft carrier or any capital ship are suppose to be sooo expensive that 99pc of the time they serve as dissuasion forces.. the simple presence of a capital ship should be able to protect system from enemies fleet.. witch is not the case of eve since a capital ship isn't expensive their effectiveness against small groups are limited, take the imperial super stardestroyer capable of repulsing entire fleet and other capital ship very costly to lose too

He right though. Butter is great

Nobody's advocating for unfederated transparency. A roadmap in software development is like 101 of marketing, you need to address your tactical issues of the day but underpin them with a focus on what strategically the direction you're heading. You do not need to be specific, you can be open and provide clear indicators of where direction is / could head.
---
To be clear, CCP at one stage were examples in the software industry on how an effective roadmap is produced and looks. That website for example, was one i'd often use as a source of "This is how you do it in Product Management".  Its important fact you overlook here is that they ESTABLISHED this behaviour now they've taken it back, its a form of retractive and ergo, OPs points hold - Somethings not right. Example of a roadmap (https://rust.facepunch.com/roadmap/) Its also a secondary example of how to communicate a lot without committing to too much with specifics.
---
RE: CSM.
---
Read the charter, you're there to represent the player base and they've made it clear - you do not speak for CCP. Yet you continue to act as an advocate on their behalf in all matters regarding game changes. We get it, you have inside information that not normal players get, but don't confuse the "I know stuff" to being their spokes person when you feel the community isn't on their side. You do this a lot, you approach this with a "i know best" attitude and its exactly the wrong position to take and again continues to undermine the potential of CSM's future growth here.
---
I'm well aware that you folks often walk into a room with 20 big ideas and at best you may land 1 or 2 if you're lucky and persuasive. Reading the minutes of CSM from past and present there are huge holes in the redactions of the minutes (which in truth also underpins the "transparency" of the work you guys do).  Lobbying folks to hear an idea is less about pestering power and more about substantiating your work with evidence, and when they control the outputs at all ends its hard to guage what success looks like here. If the minutes are edited/redacted "for competitive / intellectual" reasons then what actually lands in these discussions. Name one game mechanic in the last several CSM meetings that has resulted in a feature growth moment? Content refreshes and balances are one thing but lets talk about actual advancement of the game. There are no growth features, just content refreshes.
---
We want this game to succeed and CCP are in a bad place at the moment, and folks need to stop apologising or watering down their "potential" responses because what you in turn do is remove the need for them to respond. Instead they can sit back and let the narrative self-correct without intervention and as a result we as a "community" become a self-fulfilling prophecy on what change looks like - not a lot except rehashing the same tired game mechanics with fresher content, skin changes and more and more secondary economy stimulus like "skill injectors cheaper or free"
---
When we do active change within CCP via a tactical reaction it comes in the form of a bait and switch - example Police skins... "Hey we responded to your concerns and decided to do a 18 day push on bans...we banned 3,000 players...which you can see from daily logins made no dent in population of game metrics..but to celebrate, buy my fucking new skin" ... WHAT....we force you to address a growing community concern and then you have the gaul to then use that to exploit more buying? Well fucking played.
---
Don't offer sympathy ..offer results. You're not here to be the voice of CCP... let them speak. Shut the fuck up.

Hey, I will highlight it for you he said "If you wish". He did **not** do any of the following.

"

* Using multiple accounts, voting services, or any other software to increase or decrease vote scores. 
---
* Asking people to vote up or down certain posts, either on Reddit itself or through social networks, messaging, etc. for personal gain.
---
* Forming or joining a group that votes together, either on a specific post, a user's posts, posts from a domain, etc.

One could almost say that he did not brigade and could think that the ban is absolutly disproportionately.   
---
You are the one that lawyered his way into this, not me. But since I am a better lawyer then you are I can tell you what he did does not fit the term brigading. You think it does, but it doesn't. Neiterh the real nor the reddit definition of it. Calling "You can upvote (if you wish)" bridgading would make any mention of the upvote funktion brigrading. Why isn't it then? Because brigading specificly requires people to tell people to upvote or ask for upvote.   
---
Marshy doesn't give a fuck,he just creates a new account here. I think banning people at all is a huge problem and even more when the reason for that is extremly shaky. And yes, you don't see yourself not qualified for a mod because you thought you've caught another marshy, but when you've realized that I am not Marshy and you have made a fool of yourself for harassing me then you'll probably see more clear. This here is ridiculous. You should consider thinking about what your task as a MODERATOR is and what steps are reasonable.  
---
Your harassment towards me really is the lowest I've ever seen on reddit and that coming from a mod is just a shame.

---
tl;dr ban evasion for a year, original ban because of vote brigading. Only a 24 hour ban to boot and he decided 1 day was too long and started ban evading with alt accounts. I'm not even the one who banned him. He's just convinced it's a goon conspiracy.
---
If only there were some sort of group of people, a team if you will, that's sole focus was on communication and building a dialog with the player base. If only such a thing had ever existed.

I'm handing the thread itself off to someone else but the patreon link in your comment has got to go friend. 
---
Potentially true,  but I don't really use Reddit as a friendship maker and to be honest, the initial topic of supplying different types of vessels who perform a role that would imply some heavy risk to the typical "lol-capdrop" game-play that has effectively protected Goon, Test, Horde and Fraternity for the last 6 years could do with a refresher.
---
It would impact me in the sense that I'd have more reason to venture out with roaming fleets in those areas more often,  at the moment I really only bother when I have a WH into Null.
---
When the best content is effectively T1 frigate play inside Novice holes in FW, you know you've got an issue. 
---
Take the latest Star Wars,  where a fleet of small ships took out a massive ship because they didn't perceive the threat.  
---
The idea you're stating is "Other ships are only used because they're effective against small ships" - the reality is capital ships are always protected by smaller ships in every other example except Eve. 
---
I’m just exploring in gurista space so does that mean I can run all gurusta combat sites? The maze is the hardest combat site right?

lol what. Look at the reddit terms of service I linked you bud. This is reddit.com so those *might* be pretty relevant.

&gt; Really? Is it? Because I fail to see where Marshy told people to upvoted that post. I only see him inviting people to join in and and upvote if they wish(!!). If people wish to upvote that post out of their own conviction (because they wish so) it simply ISN'T vote brigading!
---
Here is marshy directly admitting that the fleet motd + discord was vote brigading:

So this is concentrated nullbear logic. The way you folks play this game is a combination of being fanboi cheerers of your alliances and diablo/wow style asset acquisition of the next epic ship. Success is measured with MER. And your game is all about which alliance you're with and which alliance you collapse. Who is shit and who is blue. Who is us and who is them.
---
We are whalers. We play to explode ships and do it in most intelligent, creative, epic ways possible. We are disgusted by the powercreep craze you turned this game into, and inexperienced unskilled softies farming under extreme safety. We are here to put a dent in that safety. It is an accomplishment for us if your Rorqual pilots can't afk mine, or a ratting super has at least a small chance to die despite being protected by 600 active titans behind. 
---
We do what we take to be our mission pretty damn well. And that is despite your CSMs shaping the game in your way. Your reddit warriors shitting on ideas. Your mods silencing our independent voices. And all kinds of meta shit you try to pull on us, because you can't deal with us in game.
---
We couldn't care less which alliance dies or lives as long as the space that is supposed to be dangerous, is dangerous.
---
Thus it is the only MMO that has retained my attention for years, and I can't seem to get away from it.
---
Despite being anti-social in real life.

---
&gt; I don't need to look for justification at all if I don't want to. Unlike you though I don't lose my mind and break out into tears the moment someone criticizes me.
---
As somebody who has gone down a similar career path early on I can give a bit of advice here.
---
**Should I be going through wormholes yet, or just stick to low sec?** 
---
I personally didn't like lowsec much. Lowsec is the land of pirates and to me the loot drops weren't worth it. Wormhole space is strange. In Class 1 - 3 wormholes you'll find basically 2 types of sites that concern you: sites with rats and sites without rats. Ideally you'll be looking for sites without rats, especially if you're not flying ships fitted for the task. To identify whether there are rats in a data/relic site or not, just scan it down and check the name. If it has a pirate name in it (ex: Guristas \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ or Serpentis \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ etc.) it will not have rats in it. Unsecured or perimeter sites will have rats in them, you shouldn't be really running those in a Heron or any other T1 exploring frigate, really. This also answers " **Is there a ship that could handle the NPCs that spawn when exploring without being super expensive?**". I personally haven't run wormhole sites with rats in them often, so I'm not super qualified for this, but T3 tactical destroyers are nice wormhole diving ships, I hear.  
---
**What am I supposed to do when enemy npcs show up at my sites?** 
---
Leave. Unless you're specifically expecting them and you know which ships to kill first, which ships trigger more spawns, and you're specifically fitted to fight them, just warp away.
---
**Will I be attacked in low sec, or does it not matter either way?** 
---
I haven't been attacked in lowsec yet personally, but I've ran a total of like 20 sites down there so I haven't spent much time in there. It is a land of pirates so keep an eye out for local channel and **DSCAN**. Dscan often - this applies in WH space as well as lowsec and to an extent nullsec too. Learn to use it. Someone could combat probe you down really quickly, and dscan will be the only advance warning you'll have before they're landing and locking you up. Often though people will kill explorers, since they know your cargo hold may be full of valuable stuff.
---
**What level security should I be exploring in as an alpha?** 
---
WH space is a nice place to go - specifically class 1 - 3 if you can't fit covert ops cloaks, but the loot drops are comparable to nullsec. If you can, nullsec is a really nice place to go. I'd advise you join a nullsec alliance though first, so you'll have intel channels and stuff to use. Also, if you enter nullsec anywhere other than in Providence (Proviblock represent) you'll be killed by the locals there. 
---
**What ship should I be aiming for that could take out the npcs and still be effective at exploring?** 
---
T3 tactical destroyers are good I hear, but I haven't tried it personally. T3 strategic cruisers are really good for WH ops, but they're blingy and they take a while to train into. As for the Sisters of EVE ships, the Astero is relic/data sites only and I wouldn't recommend using it to fight rats. The Stratios is a murder boat and it's also good at exploration, but again, semi blingy. You can expect an investment of around 200 million ISK. The Nestor is **A SPECIFICALLY FLEET SHIP**. I've seen people fly these solo and get punished for it.
---
**Will I be attacked at all in low sec?** 
---
Oh yes. You'll be attacked everywhere in EVE.
---
**Difference between low sec and null sec?** 
---
No one will protect you in lowsec, but in nullsec there might be alliance members and other stuff that can come to your aid. Also, the loot drops are better in nullsec. 
---
**Are there better paths than exploring? Or just what else can I do/what is everything else like?** 
---
EVE Online is a game and so have fun. There are certainly more ways of making ISK than relying on RNGesus to give you easy hacks and good loot drops, but do what you enjoy.
---
Ratting is a reliable and less active form of ISK making and the big boy action is mostly in nullsec. Ratting gives you reliable and regular bounty payments and if you want you can loot wrecks and salvage them for even more ISK.
---
Exploration is less reliable but you can make more than 100 million ISK in 1 hour if you're lucky.
---
Killing people is fun and some people fly blingy ships, which can drop expensive modules you can dump on the market for ISK
---
Mining is mining, you can do it AFK, you can do it while socializing with fellow buddies, you can build ships for other people to get blown up in/kick ass in
---
Basically there's a lot to do in EVE. I'd recommend getting your feet wet in all the activities, but in the end do what makes YOU happy. 
---
If you have any other questions send me an EVE mail (Otto von Bitchmarck) and I'll happily reply.
---
Fly safe buddy o7
---
You still fail to come BB coms and tell me that I am marshy. Your Evidence is none, you bended the definition so it fits you. 
---
Is there an anti-bot force corp?
---
**What level security should I be exploring in as an alpha?**
---
Try 1 -&gt; 0.5, safe and you can learn.
---
**Will I be attacked at all in low sec?**
---
Yes, a jump into lowsec should be considered dangerous if you dont know whats on the other side.
---
**Difference between low sec and null sec?**
---
In lowsec there are guns at the gates that attack people who attack you. Attacking people in lowsec lowers security status. In nullsec there are items and ships dedicated to creating large bubbles that stop you from warping when inside them, these are not allowed in lowsec.
---
**Are there better paths than exploring? Or just what else can I do/what is everything else like?**
---
You could try lvl 1 missions, mining, trading.
---
Post removed. Asking how to use bots is a ToS violation / leads to ToS violations - which we remove here.
---
To answer your question though - it is a bannable offense in Eve, yes.
---
now the bots are bait posting on reddit to distract the community from bots in game.
---
I'd love a revamp to the CSM where the actual people running are kept secret on pain of disqualification, and instead, players click on AGENDAS they want for the game, with the vote going to the corresponding candidate(s). Each candidate is limited to 2-3 agendas or something of that sort. It would remove the name recognition/popularity issue, and we'd actually be centering the election on IDEAS instead of people. Various issues with the specifics of this would need to be worked out but I think it's doable.
---
Interesting how the post simply stops loading whenever it’s removed. 
---
canceled it, and replaced it with something else.

&gt;you seem to just believe whatever lie mar5hy tells you with no questions asked

lmao. Can't profe what he says.. but says we believe everything that marshy says. Hey, how about your are just objectivly wrong?
---
well in starwars the ship is lost because of the extreme arrogance of the officer in command and the obvious fail design. 
---
but Cap aren't suppose to be use against none caps ship or structure specially not in eve, UNLESS they equipe capital ship with a point defence system like the structure lets say range of 10km.. frigate/cruise would be in danger than !
---
&gt;Your reddit warriors shitting on ideas.

Uh, yeah, because they're nearly all terrible. You don't engage in any actual critical thinking when you ejaculate your horrible neanderthrashings all over the internet. Why do you think someone like me can so effortlessly take them apart?

I would be so happy if these points woud be adressed. I’d like to see a change to how rorquals (especially PANIC) work but I think the stated issues are more important.

Nice b8 m8 but you should look up what that means first 
---
Tell me how does this change anything? You did lose your mind and broke out into tears for beeing criticized.  
---
Examples?   
---
You started harassing me with some really questionable evidence that I am marshy (to have hands free to ban me)  
---
You said that you will punish the whole of BB for what I am saying here   
---
You seem like you don't want to give me a chance to disproove your very weak evidence with your claim that makes it justified to ban me any time you want to  
---
You did all this in response to my all over very civil critic of your claim that someone broke the rules.. which he really doesn't.   
---
Now that sounds like a reasonable response of someone who totaly isn't wrong and aware of that.
---
Oh shit, were we supposed to pull our punches for the health of the game? Shit, no one told us we were the stewards of the video game!

Can't unproofe what is not there. So.. 0 losses of any mining able ship or ratting ship in 10 years. either I am the luckiest miner for 10 years or I really don't crab.
---
&gt;We are whalers. We play to explode ships and do it in most intelligent, creative, epic ways possible.
---
We are epic. You are shit because you're in a large alliance. Large alliances never have good manual pilots or individualistic thinkers. It's just a hive mind of F1 monkeys. But not us. We are elite. We are  E B I C. We are whalers.
---
“We haven't seen a nullsec, lowsec or wormhole focused expansion since Parallax in 2015. Abyssal Deadspace, Activity Tracker, Agency, Citadels, Clone States, Moon Mining, Pirate Citadels/FOBs, Skill Trading - all these major changes were designed to be accessible to all “
---
None of these things are relevant for lowsec at all. Doing abyssal sites in low is the most retarded thing ever since you’re essentially doing something in a place where everyone is hunting you and the sites are equivalent in highsec. Agency are also useless in low. Citadels was another nail in the FW coffin.
---
Lowsec essentially hasn’t seen any love in years and years.

---
those 20 bil hels losses from random dumbs sure left a dent in my wallet according to marshy
---
I would like to know attendance statistics, who missed every god damn meeting but somehow managed to make it to Iceland?
---
&gt; Well, from my point of view it merely accelerated the natural progression towards caps. Remember PL dropping on everything and everyone that was a decent kill? Now, everyone can do that or rather: protect himself against that with a decent muscle.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;On the flipside, it needs more than just one alliance to muscle up against goons and soon, Test will join the critical mass where it outmuscles decent entities too.
---
Who says it's a given that this is the natural progress? Goons vs NCPL had a very good balance. NCPL played the first position...exclusive elitist recruiting. Goons played the second position...mass recruitment. You have a classic quality vs quantity rivalry. Now capital proliferation is insane. It's been insane but accelerated even further in the past 3 years.
---
 
---
&gt;But at that point, it's not you vs the ishtar krab it's you vs all the pvp'ers between you and the PvE player. So, why do you bring the PvE ishtar to this particular argument in the first place. Because you want to kill it to provoke a fight even if you could have fights on the road to the PvP krab?  
---
&gt;I am sorry, but doesn't that strike you as a: "I really only want to kill that Ishtar-krab"?
---
Why are we obfuscating the discussion? You were talking about the easiness of the attacker vs the krab. Clearly the attacker has way more work to put in. He should. But should it really be THAT easy for the krab?
---
&gt;Uhm, I can somewhat agree to that impression, for PvE - Mining can be a lot safer than it was years before when we had no umbrellas and sig-based mining etc. We also have that "safe" abyssal space. So yeah, PvE got easier.  
---
&gt;...  
---
&gt;The fact that we don't have constant wars and people are still affraid to lose their big toys (remember that "dock your faction titans") is a testament that it's still harsh and big losses still mean something - just that the ammount of loss one consideres "harsh" has grown.
---
Nobody wants to lose their stuff not because it's hard to replace, but because of image as well. I mean no it's not easy to replace, but making ships easier to replace doesn't automatically make the game better. Where does this assumption come from? And big fleet fights suck. Tidi lagfest. Lock target, press F1. Anyone who has been in the massive fights knows how garbage they are.
---
&gt;Nah, not really. You don't need 50k people - you just need a ton of isk. Keeping the timer paused with dreads then welping dreads till the keepstar is dead is a viable option, if you can afford it. What was it? 300 dreads to do this or so. So yeah, can be done, still expensive. Which was my point when we argued about whether it's possible or not.  
---
&gt;As I said, the argument can't be a "you can't by design" because you do have the option to destroy everything. Whether or not you are capable of doing that is a different argument really. I understand that you as part of a small entity can't yield the tools needed (not enough people, not enough ISK) but saying it's "impossible for you to do so" is a really different thing.
---
I mean it's "possible" to spill iced tea on the Eve servers and wiping everything out. It might be better to discuss what is viable.
---
&gt; Nah, we certainly don't, it's just an example for the fact that there are people out there that can't rely on an alliance. Renters are an extreme example, yes. However, there are alliances out there that simply don't have a capital umbrella and a widespread network of jumpgates etc. and I don't agree that they are irrelevant for the discussion. 
---
You don't need a cap umbrella. You just need to be able to warp to a citadel since they are in every system and take forever to grind.
---
&gt; Yeah, ever tried that in actual sites? Yes, you can still shoot rats, but if you do it, you might as well stop doing it cause it won't lead you anywhere. Unless you are in a super ofc. 
---
But you "have the tools" right? See how this is a bad argument and we should discuss viability instead of possibility?
---
&gt; Absolutely agree here. Just that living in an alliances doesn't mean you have a 200 man supercap fleet at your disposal that will aid you when you need them. A capital umbrella isn't a default thing for joining an alliance. It only is for the big alliances. Again, the argument here was that there are people out there that have to rely on local because they have nothing else and I think that's a fair argument. 
---
TBH caps are the smallest issue out of all that I listed. Citadels are more of an issue.
---
&gt;And then someone brings 2 or 3 times the numbers to gank them. Still the same argument =&gt; numbers advantage can't be countered which is exactly your argument when you say you need 50k people.  
---
&gt;I mean, I would like group based PvE in Null a lot, but it's not a counter to my argument nor does it eleviate your problems of having the N+ advantage stacked against you.
---
Sure it does because the issue doesn't scale. 1 krab getting hit by a 3 man group is different than a 10 man krab group getting hit by 30 people. You notice 30 people a lot sooner. It gathers a certain amount of attention.
---
&gt; That's just another reason why it's a wealth problem more than anything else. 
---
Yes it's a wealth problem as in it's too safe to krab making ISK a lot easier to attain. But wealth is not a replacement for skill. A good pilot with a Kestrel will wreck you regardless of your billions.
---
&gt;  Large alliances never have good manual pilots or individualistic thinkers. It's just a hive mind of F1 monkeys. 
---
Most mega alliances have intelligent and creative content creators (and then a horde of F1 monkeys). Never claimed the opposite, so there is have some solid inferiority complex at work here.
---
They used to work for CCP Atlanta too? lmao
---
&gt;Here is marshy directly admitting that the fleet motd + discord was vote brigading:
---
Naa.. he said "Which I guess is correct". You are twisting the truth like crazy. Just because he guesses you are right it doesn't really mean you are. I've answered to the Reddit definition of brigading above. He did not ask for any kind of upvotes, he did not made a group to upvote the posts or any kind of.  
---
&gt; If you want to keep pushing it then it will end very badly for you. 
---
Is that moderating for you? I disagree with what you say and your world is right by threatening to ban me?  
---
You ban was unjusttified. No Group was made to upvote the post, he did not ask to upvote. He guessed you are right because you told him that "(If you wish)" Is  bannable, its so ridiculous.  
---
Its funny that your harassment towards me is claimed that I am acting like marshy.. while marshy clearly doesn't give a f about beeing banned again and again. I don't like to use the edit button as much to make sure you see what I respond with. I wouldn't want you to miss my offer to jump on coms to tell you that I am not Marshy.  
---
In terms of discussing banning me: do you think arbitrariness is part of your job or do you acutally follow rules? Because if not.. I'd like you to stop threating me with that (including saying that I am marshy), as I stated above I think your power as a mod used to silence people is the biggest issue here, not the (very questionable) statements you baned marshy for..  and if you like to take rules so inaccurate you'd surely have no problem banning /u/irishmafiawku to show how rules apply to everyone and this sub is not biased.

Let's talk about the most important topic that we need asap: when is cat ear cosmetic coming out??
---
It makes sense for wormholes because you can't JF it.

Won't create any content for null except additional logistical effort, so it equals to a mere bounty isk/hr nerf.
---
what major updates have happened since citadels?

His original post: https://www.removeddit.com/r/Eve/comments/aro5lq/is_it_safe_to_crab_in_delve_anymore/

The FBI would like to know your location.
---
&gt; Prices of caps being cheaper than Blops and Mauraders while having high insurance safety to boot is absurd. 
---
This tracks throughout EVE. 
---
A T1 destroyer is cheaper than a T2 frigate and insures better too
---
A T1 cruiser is cheaper than a T2 destroyer and insures better too
---
A T1 battlecruiser is cheaper than a T2 cruiser and insures better too
---
A T1 battleship is cheaper than a T2 battlecruiser and insures better too
---
A T1 carrier is cheaper than a T2 battleship and insures better too

this streams giveaways are based on tickets they have a 2 hr between start and the giveaway, you can buy at most I've seen 5 tickets so if you watch from the start of the giveaway you can always get the same number of tickets as everyone else.

That's gonna be a yikes from me dog
---
Null sec is best sec for exploring in my opinion. Either guristas space or Sansha space. It's both accessible and profitable, but people will try to kill you if you don't have friendly standings to them. 
---
Don't worry about sites with rats, just focus on exploring for now, take a T3C later on if you want to run sites with rats.
---
You will absolutely be attacked in low sec at some point, as with any other security space for that matter.
---
Null sec has bubbles, low sec has insta-locking thrashers on gates. With a little know how both are avoidable.
---
The last question you have to find out for yourself, exploration is profitable (100mil per hour or greater when you get used to it) but there are other career paths that are also lucrative but require a bit more skill/isk investment. Exploring is great for a new player because the entry skills are directly within reach and the ship you explore with will only cost you a few mil properly fitted. Which you can cover and then some running one site in null sec.
---
Hope that helped
---
*Why don't you have a seat right over here...*  
---
Based on the current business model of them focusing on whales in lieu of player base at large, I do think its more intentional, but combined with some true incompetence. 
---
the intentional parts are: 
---
get newbs to spend $$ for injectors to get into mining
---
get newbs to spend $$ for plex to have a 2nd account and start multiboxing
---
hope that few of those newbs have spare income to continue multiboxing and injecting in order to become the whales.
---
gambling trial
---
The incompetent parts are the bugs that often prevent anyone from even finishing these in the 1st place in order for the intentional parts to work.
---
Yes ban me because I obviously vote brigade every post!
---
Yea, I don't do it either, i was reading some gaming articles somewhere though and it came up, hence I asked. 
---
Could really use some pro twitch users here to clear things up.
---
Thank you for helping raise awareness
---
I hope you're right about this, because by publishing it to reddit, you might have just committed defamation per-se. 
---
Do they limit representatives to one per alliance?  
---
If English is not your first language, I apologise for laughing so hard.

Pohds you fucking asshole
---
sib sqd isn't related to SW. they only joined for a week or two when SW was getting their shit pushed in, and then moved to RMC.
---
there was animosity between XIX and RA, and sibsqd was in virtually every russian entity in game before forming their own alliance.
---
but the whole point of this is that they all agreed to put past differences behind them
---
I think before you make shit like this public. Maybe think about the consequences you could have on this person.   
---
What if they try and kill themselves over this? Will you be smug about your Reddit fame then you pieces of shit.

You should go the proper route for this.....

The only help i hope getting got around here is help for that girls father to find his address and kick his fucking ass.

As I recall: defamation requires the target to prove the instigator willfully mislead the public on information known to be false.
---
That's Pohds' voice. Accurate enough for me.
---
Fat-ass piece of shit 
---
Very cool and very legal!

they are just insults. People who use these terms are just insulting themselves.

Pearl Abyss will ruin eve 100% fact. Enjoy the game while it is still alive, there isn't much time left.

Well. Damn. listened to the recording and the moment he said she was 14 you instantly hear everybody disconnect.

This is not a good look for Elo if that part is true...
---
Is that from Texas Law ™? 
---
Only if it is a against a public figure. For a private individual you have to show falsehood, real harm, dissemination to a 3rd party, and facts (as opposed to opinions.).
---
Part of me hopes it's not true. But the other is like "if it is true, we've got him. CUFF HIM BOYS!"

Why do I get the feeling that his stories are full of shit?

because there are too many people looking to rent a system.

I have a feeling CCP is going to be getting a lawful request for information soon.
---
That's why I said "per se" - some claims are considered so serious that damage from them does not need to be proven and it's entirely down to the defendant to offer a mitigating defence.  
---

i hope he gets caught by chris hansen
---
already reported, but thank you.
---
They probably are full of shit, but given the visibility this now has, people are gonna have some questions for him, people with badges.
---
Thats a hard yikes from me.  I hope this was sent to the authorities so if this is real these girls can get some help.  
---
    
---
As the father of three teenage  daughters I am always concerned about this.  Fortunately I have had some pretty frank discussions with them about what kind of people can be lurking online and how to protect themselves.  But not every parent is as forward thinking. 
---
Tbh - for the sake of the girls - I hope he was just joking in poor taste,  but this reeks of a pattern of behavior and that is not good. 
---
Im not all "rawr castrate the fucker" without more evidence of abuse - but I do hope he is smacked hard by authorities to set him on the path to help and I hope these girls stay safe. 
---
&gt; jokes on you, i was only pretending to be a pedophile
---
I mean, even if that is the case…
---
I hope I'm right too. I'd feel bad asf if I was wrong and just ruined this guy's eve career. But gotta admit this is pretty damning.
---
Were you the one that said Poitot is the only lowsec system in Syndicate? :|

hahahahahhahaha you died to bigbilltheboss ahhahahhahahah

Recording people without consent is not legal in some states.

Very legal and very cool!
---
Vexor Navy Issue. I run them with a typical Nullsec ratting fit you can find on google. I never even lose half my shield with them. You just have to orbit something and throw your AB on and you’re good.
---
namely according to ***TEXAS LAW***
---
&gt;I didn't threaten to ban you dumb dumb.
---
Are you sure? What do you mean by   
---
&gt;If you want to keep pushing it then it will end very badly for you.  
---
Or how about  
---
&gt;If the brigading continues you're going to get Amok'd. 
---
Can you clearify that?  
---
Because I see you just lying again. And confirming that you are willing to abuse your powers.  
---
&gt;I reply with actual hard evidence. 
---
You've posted TWO pieces of evidence so far and both of them are very weak, far from being a proof.   
---
How about me writing and something like Marshy? Not even an evidence of that. Yet you seems to refuse to jump on coms to talk to me .. I know you would look like a fool, but coming one step closer to the truth would be beneficial, wouldn't it?  
---
Its easy to say you have evidence when you take everything as evidence that you consider beeing one as a proof (despite it is not) and you just ignore every evidence that acutally is here or given to you. I've been sitting on coms for over two hours so you can hear yourself and we can go past this.   
---
&gt;And yet you're still able to post. 
---
Maybe because you know you are wrong. But since you twist the truth to fit you you could never say that out loud.  
---
&gt;Just sip on your hard evidence. I've got bigger fish to try than boring marshy drama at the moment. No one cares about him anymore. 
---
Yeah, start doing your job here and stop harassing people for arguing with you. What ever you consider moderating is, what you did here is nothing but showing that you won't follow rules if it doesn't suit you yourself but will ban, imtimidate and threaten people that don't agree with you.   
---
Let me remind you, that this is not your personal platform.  
---
Back to the topic: Banning people is bad. Telling people that they can upvote if they wish is hardly asking for upvotes and even less running a network aimed at upvotes. Your initial ban is not justified by the rules of this sub besides beeing unreasonable harsh considering people that insult other people regulary don't face any penalty for anything.
---
Remove asset safety
---
Probably not a coincidence you can't spell pedophile without the letters "pohds"
---
Certainly seems that way, but be careful with your statements and be sure to cover your own arse, the last thing you want is it coming back to bite you for trying to do the right thing.

because space is empty and noone cares about their adm, the defence of your region isnt tied to the sov system, if your staging citadels die you lose, sov is meaningless
---
seriously, just dont waste your time and find another game to invest your time into, this company is a joke
---
ccp dont care, banning bots is bad for business
---
Generally speaking there's 3 use cases for an AB on a battleship:
---
\- Nightmares, with their large AB bonus, actually get decent speed; it's still not MWD-grade but it's good enough that on PvP fits you usually go AB over MWD pretty much all the time, especially since the AB lets you generally pull range against most MWD-fit tackle if you have a defensive scram, and by doing so you can then blap them with your huge volley and DPS (at least compared to a 5k EHP tackler frig);
---
\- triple prop nano battleships, where you run the full suite of MWD, MJD, and AB, and use the AB to try and pull range on things that scram you; the most memetastic example of this is the Barghest, but theoretically any battleship with 5-6 mids can pull this off (more than that and you're going to struggle to get decent shield tank with the required utility/prop mods and less you're going to not be able to get the required utility in the first place);
---
\- in rare cases it's a useful way to reduce the applied DPS from missile fires if you expect to take a lot of, say, Capital or Standup (structure) missile fire- though I'll be honest and admit I've never thought of this one before
---
For the most part MWD or MJD are going to be the preferred options for trying to maneuver on grid, with MWD being slightly more general purpose (MJD is usually preferable for torpedo battleships because you don't much care about things that don't scram you while things that do you can mostly scram back and then vaporize them with *TORPEDOBEATS).*
---
But such people aren't devs, therefore there's no reason they would need to pay someone like that!  Community doesn't matter at all!
---
I can just picture the levi pilots licking the screen.. saying in local shhttt.. just let it happen ill be gentle..

Idk if serious or not, but no. Goons have 4 members out of 10. 5 if you count their pets.
---
i think mutaplasmids were a good way to get people gambling
---
yet most system are empty what a waste of content :(
---
You pretty much got the gist of it.
---
than it shouldn't matters to the renter if someone is farming the system they would even makes a couple billion out of it
---
Hundreds of streamers do this across hundreds of games. 
---
As long as he's using the correct raffle rules and using a bot to do the raffles. It's hardly RMT. 
---
 RMT is when you go to x and you pay RL money for items z. 
---
Not when you go to a twitch channel to buy points towards a raffle system that may give you an edge in a randomized raffle. 
---
Not saying any of the other shit he does is bad. 
---
Just wanted to make sure you knew how twitch raffles work before you fired up the witch hunt for a common feature many streamers do for their communities.  
---
no its not haha 
---
Only if said Dragon fleet is Happy.
---
If you limit the amount of citadels in a system, taking space would then entail dropping enough citadels in one system to hit the cap, so that nobody else can drop one. It would be *encouraging* citadel spam, not solving it.
---
Perhaps you haven't been watching reddit this last year? 100 cruisers of all flavors do die to t2 destroyers (bombers). I've seen at least 20 fleets deleted this way in the last 3 months.
---
&gt; Lowsec essentially hasn’t seen any love in years and years.
---
CCP forgot that lowsec exists. Lowsec doesn't have enough people to get a CSM seat, and when they did, they all fought over who it should be, so nobody got it.
---
If you go into settings (by hitting Escape) there's a menu called "Reset Settings" along the top (slightly to the right of dead centre iirc).
---
You can reset specific settings in the left panel, or on the right panel, do a more thorough reset (there's a few options depending on how totally reset you want it to be).
---
Carebears are a slang term for people who PVE and nothing else, who are completely unprepared for PVP combat and complain about PVP combat. Sometimes just shortened to anyone who PVE's.

F1 Pusher refers to average line members in large blob fights whose main contribution is to act as a plus one to the damage output of the fleet, as the F1 button is their fire button. AKA Anchor on FC, press F1 (fire)
---
As for the main topic, I like eve because it's constantly evolving and there's so many different ways of playing the game. I'm very recently taking advantage of TEST's deployment in Perimeter to do some lowsec roams to try and improve my piloting skills.
---
Well, FRT has been botting up an assload of titans/supers ever since the NIP.  Been there lately?  Its like mini-delve, FRT titans failing to boson everyone on every gate.
---
No.  You just can't run a subscriber only giveaways.  However giving extra currency for ticket buying to subs or donators is fine 
---
Was this called for before or after Goons got 5 members elected to the CSM?
---
Sort of. I can't speak for guristas specifically, but I know in Serpents space for example I think it was the 8/10 that was super spooky, but the 10/10 was laughably easy (as in easier than a 7/10). So I wouldn't go with the assumption lower is easier.
---
if you cant find an alliance to rent from you have brain problems, id love to help you out and list some examples but i feel like you wouldnt know how to use the information if it was sitting right infront of you (it is)
---
You're retarded. 
---
No. All boosters are now legal, and synth ones are trash, so they have no function.
---
1. Drones....from medium and up need to have their damage and application dropped. Ever since Drones became a legit weapons platform in what 2012 it has been an issue, and CCPs fixes by nerfing drone based ships have not changed it. This isn't a Fighter only issue, it starts from medium drones, and runs the hole spectrum up to them...and is why drone boats are still the favored platform for pretty much everything.  
---
2. Take Faction BPOs from NS and put them in LS.  
---
3. Remove Panic Modules.  
---
4. Give us a road map.
---
That was like The Scope videos that CCP killed 🤔
---
You're retarded x2
---
because usually what happens is 1-2 people rent a system, and then rat there few hours a day, the rest of the time systems sit empty, but because they paid for exclusive access no one else can rat there
---
&gt; if they can't handle getting killed in NS they should probably not be there
---
this is very much so
---
or maybe im currently sitting my ass in one of the shit hole of the world deployed and trying to gather information while im able to physically interact with different renting channel how about that ;) but it must be my brain right ?
---
fair point but its a shame for corporation or smaller alliance that are truly ready to use the rented system to the maximum.
---
oh well 2 more weeks of deployment and ill be able to make contact in game im looking forward to go back in null
---
i don't understand anything i hear in these vids or streams but they're always cool to watch

Here are the rules your are supposed to enforce. Ban yourself maybe?
---
I agree, t2 destroyers would rape cruisers, but if you have everyone in range fit caracals with rapid lights, it would be an interesting battle. T2 bombers are frigates not destroyers, but the point here is that t2s are supposed to be a threat to t1 superior class ships, right now theyre a joke.
---
Not really, I'm just tired of reddit tryhards saying the same copypasta about narrative and then literally never changing up their own take on things. Kinda seems like just another narrative to me.
---
After all the rage and hatred after the AT announcement, they decided to alleviate some of the anger by adding a second Agency Tracker button for good measure. =)
---
Citadels in NPC and Empire aren't *too* bad aside from abuse in FW. Plenty of HiSec structures are taken down by various wardec alliances and other small bashing groups. It'd be nice if FOB rats could actually pause structures rather than just send out 4 pings an hour. If they showed up for kill timers with the same pause-capable dps, you'd see a lot more HiSec structures die to them which would help a lot for region clearing (and would probably make more people who actually live in HiSec run the FOBs to prevent it.)
---
They're a godsend for NPC null with quite a few regions having huge swaths of space that's awful to live in without one (GW, Venal, Outer Ring for example). There's plenty of abandoned citadels around there but bashing low power structures is honestly really easy now if nobody shows up to defend them. Three guys in bombers/oracles can take one down in about half an hour.
---
I would love to see a ban on citadels in FW space as they're just too easy to abuse there, and perhaps treat them like POSes in terms of system limitations across all of New Eden - one per moon, can't be anchored anywhere else.
---
Largely okay with your points aside from that. Would be nice if they put more effort into differentiating the different security regions while still keeping them viable for the people who lived there.
---
As for player representation, CCP suffers from the same problem a lot of studios do - they just don't put enough into community teams. It's hard for these studios to make the argument to corporate, despite all the people here who could tell you what they'd be willing to pay money for and never seeing it because hey, no community team.
---
I trust that you had a unpleasant experience with that particular organisation tell me more so I can avoid to put my boys in the same ;)
---
You'll be happy to know that "nerf gila" is one of the few things they're in agreement on over on the ship balance thread.
---
from the perspective of a landlord, it doesn't matter whether it's one person renting, or a 100 man corporation. what matters is whether they pay rent on time, there is no revolving door, and they don't cause issues.
---
whether it gets used to the maximum is not really a concern.
---
I'm checking now since I'm in roughly the same boat, I think each race (inside each faction) has their own starting tutorial that you can play for a total of 9. I'll reply again once I figure it out.
---
The difference in scale is drastically different in that category. Compare EHP, damage, range, and the fact they have jump drives. It's a very different level of difference. 
---
Could be worse, at least it isn't the *New Eden Store* button.

That should do it.

I don't know what you are even babbling about. Is vertically farmed nullsec being overly safe a narrative? Is the majority of null linemembers' merely playing for 0 skill 0 creativity asset acquisition a narrative? Is MERs being pushed as the mere metric of victory a narrative? Is CSM overrepresenting nullbear farmer worries a narrative? What's the falsely spoken thing here? I was banned from this subreddit for saying there is mod bias, to mods, in a PM. They had to ban me for saying there is mod bias, to prove me there is no mod bias lol. I was banned from r/Eve discord merely because Goons didn't like me. Guess even mods silencing independent voices was a narrative.
---
You got this wrong. We are the minority. You are the majority. You make the narratives. We don't have such power. We disseminate unpopular truth and sometimes it latches. Although it's like pissing against the wind, years and years of reddit posting causes small changes. An anomaly nerf here, a cyno inhib buff there. Speaking the truth is all we got.
---
While I agree, the Somalians have been pretty effective ganking haulers in the middle east.
---
It's not that they bring caps. It's that they bring more of them than you brought of you. Change the ship types and meta however you want. More of them will beat fewer of you.
---
I can't wait for CCP to literally hand wave everything in OP away. 
---
&gt; Well...at least we could fuck ourselves watching some nice adult movies.
---
They're gonna make the billboards in game... interesting.
---
I'll give it a shot, thanks. Shouldn't need to liquidate anything, for some reason I've still got two Gnosis and some manticore hulls and am flying a Caracal. 
---
Shame it’s a Thursday. I’d be interested in coming up from Iowa some time if it’s on a weekend. 
---
No problem! I wasn't suggesting you liquidate anything, I was just letting you know I did and still managed the mission with a civilian ship. 
---
1 carrier with fighters will beat 8-10 destroyers.
---
If you want to be in a corp, you don't go on fleets with folks that specifically target the alliance that corp is in.
---
That was just pathetic. 
---
Frigates kill freighters/ jump freightors all the time in eve for the same reason Somalians can pull it off because the freighters aren't really armed besides a few small arms.
---
I'm sorry but I have no interest in the AT. At my planktonic level of existence it's a total irrelevance. Maybe if I had a reason to care... It's like Mos watching soccer... oh, I do declare, perhaps that fellow will do something. Apparently he has because the crowd is cheering... Oh look, someone else did something!

Thank you for the videos.

Heard about this thread from a friend. Want to point out something:
---
Only bits cannot be used to reward viewers. Bits are a direct transaction between the end user (viewer) and twitch. Cash donations, subscriptions, etc may all be used to reward viewers. Everything he's doing seems to be okay by *twitch*'s rules.
---
bee man bad ! 
---
This is untrue. Many tools such as streamlabs chatbot have features built-in to support additional tickets or entries for followers or subscribers.
---
Bits are the only thing streamers cannot leverage in any way.
---
Just like last year's FRT "war declaration" wasn't FRT VS TEST.  It was FRT + SKILLU + VOLTA + PH + NC. + PL + BL vs TEST

If you guys could keep this discussion civil and informative that would be great.

If they nerf the carrier to 1:1 parity then they'll just bring 10 of what works.
---
No I just know Goon rules! Because I was flamed realy hard for stating my opinion on the matter. 
---
imagine joining the military so u can brag about it on r eve

Its the drones.

Run a damage model comparing applied damage from drones vs like sized weapon systems of other types. They blow them away all the way up the ladder except for light.

Then add more events so we have classic-style events, directly dropped accelerators and rather than dropping blueprints dropping the minerals, actually decent reprocess yields...

Fair enough and makes sense. You think the remnants of prothean and scourge will end up joining this russian coalition as well? Or possibly bring back some big ex russian players that have left over the years?

#poitotawarenessmonth

I just want CCP to actually fucking talk to us. Are they okay with the state of the game? Are they going to try and push it in any direction in the future? Do they think our concerns are legitimate? What is there vision for EVE?
---
At the moment if someone asked CCP what their ultimate version of EVE would be in 5 years time and they actually answered, I've got no idea what the answer would be. 
---
that remains to be seen. a lot of people don't think this will get off the ground, so we may see more people/corporation/alliances join after there is more clarity around what this coalition will look like, and the war actually starts.
---
scourge always positioned themselves outside of russian eve community, so not sure if any of their corps will join (one of them joined skillu, so likely to be on the other side of the war)
---
I'm somewhat new and never spent any considerable time in nul.
---
What did CCP do that made players have more power to make their nul space safe?
---
You're right, two dozen odd lemmings can never be wrong.
---
You know you are getting somewhere when you have hate coming your way. Too bad the two of you are so random I have no idea who you are.  Thank you for the sweet sentiments just the same.

Uh, did you read what OP wrote? He wants essentially direct democracy, where the players vote on design decisions. That's essentially unfettered transparency - they can't ask people to vote on something that doesn't include explanations and details. 
---
I don't know where you're getting that I "act as an advocate on all matters, blah blah blah." I don't. I pass on the community's position to them. When I think the community is going off the rails, I point it out, but I don't contradict criticism I agree with. This is one situation where I think folks need to think more deeply about the wheres and whys. I never approach anything with an "I know best" attitude - I present my opinion. Sorry if I don't preface it with enough humble language.
---
It's not our role to develop the game for them - you're all over the place, Mossy. You tell me earlier that we're not game developers, and now you act like we're not doing our jobs because we don't hand them new game mechanics that get added to the game. You're being inconsistent. It's also absurd to think that screaming on reddit suddenly got CCP to pay attention to botting as if they hadn't been doing that for months before everybody decided to make it the subject of the two-minutes-reddit-hate of the month. 
---
As far as I can tell, Mar5hy got the standard punishment for a first time input broadcasting offense - 7 days suspension. But CCP does not and has not ever shared information with us on actions taken on individual accounts so I can't tell you why they did what they did. 
---
Look, dude. I know you're friends with Sort. But don't act like you understand the CSM because you buy him lunch.
---
He didnt even go on fleets with them, he just chatted in their channel.
---
BB target everyone (NPSI) not just goons.

And even if he did, who cares? As long as you dont shoot blues, fly with who ever the fuck you want. Esspecially in giant corps without a tight culture.

POITOT 4EVA
---
&gt;  you are holier than thou stuff
---
I'm getting older and there are 2 video games I like. Eve is the most wonderful game I played and it is decaying thanks to the culture alliances like yours disseminate. Yes, there are worse ways to play this game in that if you play that way you'll get bored and leave. If alliances promote that gameplay and shape player feedback so CCP buffs that gameplay, thats how you get the dying Eve today. 
---
You guys foolishly think I hate Goons etc but past 3 years have entirely been me raising balance and other concerns about the game's well being, and you shitting on me because these concerns are against how you shaped your alliance. Everything else between Goons and me rests on that interaction.
---
When you care about your hobby to go to meetings and pay money to CCP and buy merchandise it's fine. When I care about it you say "get a life" lmao.
---
Again, not your fucking call to make. "He wants essentially direct democracy, where the players vote on design decisions. That's essentially unfettered transparency" ... you can be smart and take the essence of it to state that people want more transparency in the futures of the game given the current climate. That's all you had to do "ok, not a fan of your idea but i get your meaning, will add it to the agenda if i can"
---
Instead you went on this rant about CCP problems. Don't honestly give a fuck about CCP internal culture / budgets or other. We're a hungry consumer expecting more, and you're the player representative not the CCP apology / advocate police. No you don't get to to be that anymore, stay in your lane.
---
I'm pretty centred on my position, game mechanics aren't clear ergo Roadmap has no futures and the only changes we've seen is Content Refreshes. I said YOU don't have game development / community management background not "we".. important but relevant distinction as you don't know half the time what you're talking about in this subject. You may understand the ideas, nuances of your voters needs/wants (ie game balances, wormhole ideas/theorycrafting etc). Don't comment on things you have little understanding of outside that, as it is painfully obvious you're just a shill for CCP when you do. It literally undermines your credibility that you worked very hard to establish.
---
So get CCP to comment, don't you comment nobody outside CCP should comment on this. If their official answer is "No comment" or "Silence" let them own that position, instead once again....YOU ANSWER FOR THEM... what part of this entire equation aren't you getting so far? ....Do you login every day to a CCP email address? ...no..then shut up.
---
Sort lunches? the fuck kinda of remark is that. So now you're trying to drag Sort into this as if that some how pivots you out of the shit storm you find yourself in?? Own your fuckup and square it with the community dragging anyone else into this is weak as fuck and demonstrates you're to preoccupied with owning the "I'm always right" narrative.
---
Sit down and take your medicine on this one as you are in the wrong and any ad-hominem attacks etc is just weak as fuck.
---
Asking to disband the csm? Probably the day after ccp announced it. 
---
It is really hard to fight TEST, even with all the alliances you mentioned. Because as soon as there is a sign of trouble, they will batphone goons and at that point the war ends.
---
The lead up to that was pretty bad, though. They were heavily criticized for not being more transparent, for not acknowledging that chat was fucked up, and for taking so long to even put the idea of tearing out the new system on the table. 
---
Some of that was deserved - Jita was fucked up over the holidays for two weeks and despite people bugging it and us bringing it up constantly it wasn't addressed, and it took a literal complete outage of the chat system for something like 12 hours to get a response. 
---
It also helped that the time between when they made the statement that they'd reevaluate and decide whether to keep the new system or revert to the old and when they actually made the decision was relatively short - around a month I believe. When it gets much longer than that, folks start screaming that nothing is happening. 
---
The war dec changes are a perfect example - you had all summer folks bitching about the CSM minutes, the structure band aid was announced at Eve Vegas in October, and right around January I had a ton of people claiming that CCP wasn't doing anything else on war decs and that their "planned spring revamp" was a lie. That's not true, but it didn't stop folks from saying it because there wasn't information ready for public consumption on their progress. 
---
Lmao? You raising what balance? Taking drones of afk rorq pilots? Get real. Besides you say EVE is decaying because of my Alliance, others say its dying. Can you show me the proof that Goonswarm has made it so the game is "decaying"? Yes, your obsession with Goons is pretty saf imo, you do need to get a life, maybe play that second favorite game of yours more?
---
Based on what evidence...  what because we don't write CCP appreciation posts on reddit all the time that somehow its forgotten. What we're supposed to reward the company beyond PLEX each month because they did their job?
---
What is this now? Adopt a CCP Puppy?
---
You don’t have the balls to do what you say you will do! It takes a person with courage, integrity and grit to do what you claim you will do.

---
You aren’t a shark, you are a minnow; prove me wrong.
---
TL;DR: complete Jibrish
---
anoms respawn instantly so a 30k man alliance needs only a handful of systems to krab in, local is instant and every null empire has bots that warn people a couple jumps out of pocket, the way sov works makes it almost impossible to attack effectively, supercap/cap proliferation makes it so that small gangs get doinked unless they can fuck off the moment anything comes on grid because its probably a cyno, they cant kill rorqs due to 5min invulnerability, rorqs can also store 80% of their value in a depot after insurance. also local cannot be stated enough it is an insanely valuable tool to the point where you never ever have to fight if you dont want to. It's gotten to the point where all pvp is made up of retards, the AFK, and people who want to fight meaning there is practically no non-consensual pvp
---
Also, game responsiveness seems to be complete ASS in the Abyss.  Half the time it seems to have a 2-3 second delay for my ship to actually follow orders in there.
---
0.0 anomalies could need something like a captial escalation chance which is a real threat to super caps. Maybe with a chance of 5% per anomaly. Would help against botters which cannot call for help.
---
Wow. You want people to elaborate bullshit claims? Slow down there. That's not how r/eve works.
---
To answer your question, not really. Null is what it had been for years, except for citadels and jbs. 
---
I understand why they wouldn't want to overpromise and underdeliver, but this isn't some rinky-dink business software. If the Microsoft Excel team says "nah, we're just gonna do bugfixes and stability improvements for the next decade" you bet nobody will complain that loudly.

---
At least have comms or something.
---
You talk a lot.
---
Folks? what...1..10..20? 1000? 10,000? ...whats the quantitative analysis here that supports your general sweeping statements. You're painting a bleak outlook here that seems to elevate the position of "poor CCP, they never get their due high fives" ...
---
If you're going to die on that hill, at least demonstrate the evidence on how you got there.
---
Apex Legends is also free to play garbage capitalizing on the Battle Royale fad that seriously needed to die like 2 years ago.
---
Except he didn't shit on you ,he called you out on your bullshit. also it doesn't bother me , after all it's Reddit. :P 
---
I mean, if my 4 year old $600 laptop doesn't light on fire with the agency, maybe it's time to upgrade your fossil?
---
Idk who you are referring to by he. I get regularly shat on. Didn't say any shitting happened in this comment tree.
---
So what you're saying is that if they stick to it the coomunity respons well? What a novel concept. 
---
And almost nobidy starts screaming for stuff when they say they'll do it in three months and it's ray 1 of month 4 and there's no update. 
---
They start screaming when it's been 5 months and nothing was communicated at best or at worst things got deleted from the roadmap without explanation. Let's say like with shield slaves since that is a more popular case.
---
And how is the playerbase going to know if ccp is working on it if they don't communicate it? Are we also supposed to believe they're working on tiericide? 
---
This is not a Catch-22. The book is a good read.
---
CCP built a platform for engaging focus groups about the T3 and capital changes in the open. It wasn’t perfect but it was very well received.
---
What damned them? They have done nothing about T3 balance for years after and haven’t engaged the community. CCP went on Xmas break and left it to die.
---
Would they have been damned for making incremental changes to T3s since then? No! Would they be damned for saying they won’t change T3s for years? Yes and rightfully so.
---
That’s one of a hundred examples - CCP are not good at prioritizing small changes. That this is some unsolvable paradox is complete bullshit.
---
Disgusting

He admitted on our forums to going on the fleet that killed a Rorq,that was why he was kicked.

---
&gt;Difference between low sec and null sec?
---
&gt;No one will protect you in lowsec, but in nullsec there might be alliance members and other stuff that can come to your aid. Also, the loot drops are better in nullsec.
---
It sounds like the guy is on his own, and asking about exploration in hostile lowsec vs hostile nullsec. OP, the main differences for you are these:
---
* *some* areas of nullsec are much more densely populated than what you're used to, and people will sometimes go out of their way to hunt you down and remove you from their space
---
* warp bubbles - these prevent any ship in an area around them (comonly ~20km) from warping out, so if there's hostiles on the gate with a bubble, it becomes extremely difficult for you to navigate safely. Use [DOTLAN](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map) to figure out how active a region is, and explore the scarcely populated ones until you know what you're doing. 
---
Final note - even if you're in a nullsec alliance, and you're exploring your own, friendly space (unlikely), there's no way for friendlies to come to your aid in time if the baddies attack you, so your best bet is still to avoid hostiles entirely. 
---

---
maybe 10 people complaining per day?  
---
and the other 15.000-25.000 players ( hehe, maybe 5.000 and the rest are alt-chars?) are not complaining and doing the game.
---
12 years now for me (with breaks, but continiously since 5 years now) and I did never skill for capitals ;)   
---
90% HiSec and 10% NullSec with some excursions to Low and WH I mostly do stuff with other players TOGETHER. Everything only for community purposes, not ISK farming.  
---
Why not running lvl4 missions with cruisers or a Tristan fleet?  
---
Even Resource Wars can be fun together with people when focusing on the competition between the pilots instead of the earnings.  
---
In fact, it looks like many or most players are their own "people" by using many accounts and being their own 5 character singleplayer corp.  
---
You found a niche for you as a salvager. Why not? I mostly play EVE as an alpha and sometimes use my highly optimized Corax for salvaging in missions which my little noob-corp does.  
---
I love playing as alpha, because things are not so easy and the THINK aspect of the game is higher. Finishing a WORLDS COLLIDE level 4 mission in a Alpha-Raven can also be done solo, but a little more tactic is needed compared to doing it as an omega with a marauder ;)  
---
You want a story of positive things?  
---
The most positive thing I did was a 14-days-tour through highsec looking for systems with women's names. I met a lot of interesting people, chatting and even fighting. One guy from Ukraine is a good ingame friend now. Sure, I could have used Dotlan or something similar to find the names, but without 14 days of fun. It was so positive... I forgot to write down most of the found names ;) My list started with Martha and Berta and then... :-)))  
---
Another one?  
---
I found out, that 14 days are a good time frame for projects in EVE (for me). Once, I decided to try to survive 14 days in an occupied WH system. I used two chars. One was only for probe scanning and stayed in there. The other  did salvaging, gas mining and even PI in there and selling things in HiSec. After 14 days I had a POS there, a Prospect for gas mining and salvaging and a Nereus for transporting stuff.  The most thrilling thing was to not get shot. After 14 days I left and on the 16th day my POS finally got shot and destroyed later. Never talked to the inhabitants. I bet, they knew what i was doing and just let me do when they saw that I am of no danger ;-)
---
You can do what you want in EVE ;)  
---
It depends on your ideas, I believe.  
---
Its not just your alliance. It's alliances based on carebearing playstyle. They promoted that playstyle last 4 years now. I wouldn't go into detail here just for a dude who doesn't know me.

The goon is screwing with you in local and you guys are too dumb to even get it. Thats the second post from you claiming your are relevant . 4 months camping delve and noone cares. People rat and mine with you in local and you just watch. You killed 2 supers the converted cost of the isk in real money is no way close to covering the electricity bill of all that accounts logged in delve, not to mention plexing those accounts. You retards waste money every day to watch goons print isk. Making another thread will justify your inpotent efforts, who knows.

its real bad lag, like 5 sec complete freeze after initiating warp, just to find u in midwarp then. same with mod actiavtion. but it only happens like once per hour or so.

Today was a good day to remind me why I love the game. Flying with mcav today we got a ping that a dread was tackled trying to kill a drifter on our static. He and a Paladin got tackled by Pospy and the galaxy brain dread had no strong for another cycle and both died while we were forming. At some point we mess around and realize that we have hawks in chain and stay formed but they don't want to play after we kill one of the kiki messing around in our elite enyo doctrine. Soon we hear Singularity has an rr cyclone fleet which we brawl and have a good time with. Right as that finishes hawks start rolling around in a leshak fleet looking to cause trouble. Lead by our fearless leaders elect to engage it out gunned and undermanned as is mcav policy. Singularity lads roll up for round two (three?) mid fight unexpectedly. Then at the same time we bring a yolo pve dread in and novac shows up in an armor fleet. We now have a dread on field and 4 different groups seemingly shooting each other at random. I'm not sure anyone really knew who was shooting what but it was a blast of a 4 way brawl dumpster fire. You just can't get that kind of bizarre organic fight anywhere else, complete chaos. Even if we fed it was obscenely fun and we are happy we took that fight even if we knew success was unlikely because it ended gloriously. BR looks a little strange as it also includes the kiki and the enyos that killed it early plus some other earlier shenanigans but it has most of the body count on it.

Man seeing the equation of this crazy MMO we play to showbiz really takes me back and sets things in perspective. I had a friend who was aspiring towards a life in the field of performance tell me that success in showbiz "was the product of preparation and opportunity".  Seems like CCP devs are missing the former.
---
This is exactly the point of what I'm saying. Things change, get superseded by events or new priorities, and stuff that was planned or scheduled gets pushed back or nixed. Instead of accepting that, folks remember it and use it as an example of CCP being shitty and not following through on their promises. 
---
What I'm saying is that this community has very little patience and a very long memory. That doesn't make for an environment where the folks in charge are willing to err on the side of transparency. 
---
The fact that you bring up tiericide is a perfect example of something where things shifted and a project wasn't completed because other priorities superseded it, and it's been four years and people still bring it up to complain about it. 
---
A lot of people stay subbed because once Eve has sucked you in and you've gotten the feelings no other game can replicate, you eventually dip a toe back in and fall back down the rabbit hole. 
---
Did he actually shoot anything? It's not like you get told where an NPSI blops fleet goes.
---
You can read r/eve as well as the next guy. 
---
People have called for it for years. I have mixed feelings about it. I think it provides unfair access and leverage for certain groups and play styles at the expense of all others. However, without the CSM I think CCP would have made even bigger mistakes and more frequent poor decisions than the player base already complains about.
---
I really don't think CCP could do much to make this community happy. We want changes and hate change. We want new players but hate new players. We fight ourselves a lot and I don't mean in game. CCP as a business has to try to grow the game even though players hate that. I don't think CCP or the CSM can actually come up wit winning solutions to the games problems since both are driven by different goals.
---
You may want to take a walk outside and relax. You're going to pop a blood vessel. 
---
..the day a post about a frigging rorqual picture while in panic, reaching the top of r/eves feed, tell a whole lot about the games current status.
---
it is disgusting as fuck. what all u rorqual multibox greedy fucks gonna do when theres nothing to do with all the minerals anymore, because less ships blow up, because less content, because less players, because less content ( nice circle right?)
---
getting bored, mine in moloks then?
---
ccpls. no insurance on any captial class ship. 
---
ccpls limit the ammount of industrial capitals allowed per system ( id like to see goons fighting each other over the rights to mine XD )
---
ccpls..enhance the costs for supers/titans by at least 250%.
---
ccpls...ehm PA pls.. dont make this a serenity 2.0.....i mean u shitheads need to recoup that 425million right?
---
wont work when game kills itself.....
---
You sound mad. 
---
The question is who the fuck cares
---
&gt; Plenty of HiSec structures are taken down by various wardec alliances and other small bashing groups.
---
Some do, but you really need to piss someone off to get your structure shot at. 
---
POSes drove conflict in high because there was a chance (not often a reality) of a huge payoff - every now and again someone left 15b in a POS and half on average drops.
---
Citadels, though, drop no loot (well there's some salvage and modules but nothing meaningful) outside some scenarios that mostly come down to major user error like running a build job for 200 battleships. And attacks on them require 2 wardecs and 2 formups at bad times.
---
That's a big opportunity cost. In the time it takes to win one timer against a completely undefended Athanor your fleet could have made 350m-500m in mostly liquid ISK from running incursions.
---
Blowing up a POS in high was the EVE equivalent of mugging someone - sucks a lot for them but you get most of what they lose. Blowing up a citadel in high is the EVE version of setting their cat on fire - they lose even more than in the mugging, but you get nothing tangible out of it.
---
Alright, no use arguing with someone who thinks a mid-to-low budget laptop bought a few years back is a supercomputer. Have fun pushing your problems to everyone else around you.
---
T2 indy core grants a bonus to mining drone yield of 500%, I'm not talking about the high slot items for mining barge boosts Im talking about teh ship hull bonuses and the indy core bonuses.
---
Literally the state of small gang in EVE 2019  
---
What did you expect?  
---
Why don't we give players the tools to make nullsec a bit less safe again, instead of giving that job to NPCs?
---
Buffalo is not optimal for several reasons, but just like anywhere you want to make one I would do the following.
---
1. Create a plan. Are you going to meet at the same place every time? (pick a good one and try to make a deal with the place for discounts if you do). Or are you going to randomly change/rotate places/activities?
---
2. Pick a place/date (I would say 2-6 months out) and start advertising your meetup.
---
3. Create some advertisement/virtual places for your meetup (Reddit, Twitter, Discord, Eve Forums, Facebook, Ingame Channel/Mailing List, Etc.).
---
4. Search the eve forums (new and old archived ones) for the past 5-years or so with keywords for your city or any city/state etc near you.  Copy down all the names of people that made posts in those threads and then send them all EVEMAILS with your details from #2 above.
---
5. Search any in-game chat channels or find any old mailing lists and SPAM them with your information (spam with caution you don't' want to get kicked/ban).
---
6. Show up at your designated place on the correct date/time. Worst-case scenario you will have a good meal and some drinks.  The more effort you put into it the higher changes you get somethign out of it.  NOTE: location is a major factor.
---
P.S. When I lived in Texas years ago, I use to drive 3 hours to Dallas (the biggest city near me) and held it there.
---
The salvage of citadels should be buffed considerably (2-3x the value) and distributed towards t2 salvage which is easier to loot and transport. As it is there's some money in shooting structures, but not very much.
---
Apex Legends is actually very well done though.
---
You're good at stealing drones, and feeding dreads.
---
I have no issue admitting that.
---
&gt; ... so I'm not going to make doom-and-gloom predictions about what the Pearl Abyss takeover means for the future of EVE. ...
---
I did not know this ... my first thought was, "They are already selling skill points, what more can they do?"
---
What kind of drones do you run for level 3s?
---
You dont know jackshit about me except your circlejerk learned hate.

Did you just link to the google search result of the sites instead of linking to the actual sites?
---
Also did you know that the only named system in Providence is Shintaht?
---
&gt;t2 destroyers (bombers)
---
I must be misinterpreting this, are you suggesting bombers are destroyer sized hulls 
---
Yes players made it safe. But it is CCP who allows it to continue.
---
I don't need to know anything about you. 
---
That's kinda my point.
---
Best solution is to require all Eve users to have a breathalyzer attached to their PC. Like the kind they make people with DUIs install in their cars. Every few hours or so the game pauses and you have 5 minutes to breathe and register some level of blood alcohol content to continue.
---
Bots don't drink. And you should never play Eve sober.
---
Chesterfield Fancypants?
---
So they announced canceling tiericide? I must of missed it. 
---
New priorities, staff gets rescheduled, staff gets nixed. These are all things that CCP controls... 
---
That is your response? Really? I followed this comment chain because Mossy makes some very good points, especially considering the annoying whitewashing from vocal veteran players and now apparently CSM members as well. And all you have to say on the discussion when you run out of arguments is "lolumadbro". Good fucking job man, that's the way to do it
---
i did not
---
A timeout you list all? I disslike the looks of the gila and ishtar what i heard is not that good and you are much faster with sacri. I am then scared to use this at bad internet connection xD
---
No,  
---
I want content that took some effort, rather than seeing the good stuff get buried under uninspiring trash. Things that make you go " wow this is cool "  rather than " Oh look another test/goon/sperg meme" 
---
t. posted from my rorqual
---
You don't get it do you. Tiericide never finished, which is bad. But okay, we get it, bad things can happen. Now what makes us mad is (and here you should know that as you're a 'community representative' lol) the complete lack of transparency on WHY ot was suspended. Of course you can move and alter the roadmap, just explain your reasoning. Instead what they did is one dev comment on fanfest or some other god forsaken event about 'how it's still out there and will be finished eventually'. And then never ever even mentioned it. 
---
And now you, as a CSM, say that is our fault for being impatient. Good fucking job, Mr Community Representative.
---
He's been telling me over and over again to "stay in my lane" and "shut the fuck up," so I'm doing that. I have no desire to spend another minute talking to someone who can't have a conversation without being a condescending douchebag for zero reason. 
---
You haven't heard any updates on it in three years. I think it's pretty clear it's not something that's actively being pursued. I actually intend to bring it up today in our meetings as an example of something that needs to be communicated better. 
---
$600 is not a big deal for you, we've got it, thank you. Go fuck yourself now.
---
What the fuck are you babbling about? At no point in the OP was performance mentioned.
---
Does not matter. If the NPSI group of your choice is known for dropping on a particular group, and you are a member of said group, maybe you should choose a different NPSI group?
---
I love your vids, but I prefer it when you go solo. It focuses more in the action, and as you are in the gang, a lot mofe depends on the comms, which I, a shame, do not understand russian to appreciate.
---
wow you took my idea of the active anti cyno... but in my idea it was an active module (high) that do not allowe cynos to go up ...of course with fuel ...so you can´t do it forever tec,,, but still nice to put it back up!
---
&gt;  and it sets my PC on fire for a couple seconds while it tries loading.
---
no. only some players doing bobs work.
---
but to no avail. u kill a bot, owner doesnt care, ship replaced in minutes anyways ( well except supers maybe)
---
u get a bot banned...owner doesnt care, he simply creates a shitton of new alpha vni pilots...
---
well and since its the stance of a LOT of players ( and i dont wanna point in any direction), that botting is perfectly fine  ( i mean if u are a chinese player and was used to use bots legally in the last few years on serenity.u prolly think its perfectly fine..)
---
and other players who seem to finance their broke real life asses by RMT
---
and human greed in general..always needs more of everything, no matter if its useful or not....
---
need 20 rorq alts ultiboxing..cuz i need titan number 5..which i use once a year to bridge stuff..or sit in tidi somewhere..hooray......
---
eve has become retarded.
---
I mean its all pretty self explanatory on what's going on.
---
I think this is part of the issue. A good percent of people don't roam to fight, they roam to blap people not prepared for the fight. It's like the difference between a gang of you getting into a bar brawl with some randoms vs jumping into a UFC cage. Fuck off am I gonna fight Conor McGregor, but it would be funny to kick the shit out of the Eve equivalent of a truck driver.
---
Make it a dedicated PVP arena and people will avoid it, because most people are fucking dreadful at Eve. Myself included.
---
I made a post here where I tried to mention a lot of people's frustration and the contact with the community was mentioned a little. One thing to remember is that reddit is full of null, low, and wormholers. I doubt there are many high sec players on reddit so most of their complaints go unheard. Also it's not just the lack of balance that is frustrating, but the half finished features being abandoned for useless new things nobody wants like the agency and activity tracker etc.
---
My original comment in another thread: The lack of balance in terms of capital oriented ...
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/aqvsvr/why_are_people_suddenly_extracting_their_toons/egiyouf?utm_source=reddit-android
---
There used to be a group who sat in a channel called 'Macrointel', but not seen anyone in that channel for years!
---
Well, you cant wardec without them having citadels, so kinda moot point.
---
MAKE HISEC WARS GREAT AGAIN.
---
To be fair, when you have almost half the player base being told who to vote for, from Mittens himself, you can get half the CSM members.
---
Because no one used the first one.
---
I think it's boredom more than anything. Why undock anything else. 
---
It's like you're asking WoW PvP'ers to take off their armor for shits to kill an undergeared lowbie. They're not going to do it when they can just white swing it and /lol   
---
imagine being in a job a year and not delivering anything. How can you just brush over that - I know you're from politics where the aim is to stay elected not to actually change stuff but even so, it's terrible.
---
The big problem when a company doesn't share plans with its customers is that they can go off down tangents. Abyssal space is a prime example. Its great, but nobody really wanted it and its not used all that much. They should have focused their efforts eleswhere, which they would have known if they engaged properly with their customers. If they wanted to add and improve PVE, use the diamond rats. They are actually challenging, variable and interesting. But no they make some pre-caned instanced space where the challenge is a ticking clock.
---
All very true in a general sense but you sum it up with this for me - 
---
So yeah, people are quitting EVE.
---
"Does this mean EVE is dying? Nope. EVE is stagnant, and can probably survive in this state for years with meaningless fights and dozens of Rorquals being used to mine up the minerals"
---
And thats why im done, cause theres just better shit to do then that, and if thats the idea of fun for the new eve player, well dont let the door hit me on the arse on the way out.
---
F.
---
Have you recently moved to Australia?
---
How do you "clear out" space that's easily accessible, filled with NPC stations and where you can't even bubble a gate?
---
And how will this work when lo sec incursions have failed?
---
In fact only pay bounties to NPC kills in losec
---
lol i am not even close to being mad, I just am debunking you and you've got not pivot left. You instead go for the personal attacks to shift away "Oh you mad bro?" is now your best defense.
---
I'll even buy you lunch if you want :)
---
now who's mad bro?
---
Downside with these botters is they make so much ISK it was replaced before you all docked. 
---
I for one agree these types of bots should be actively hunted out and killed time after time, but there simply isn't enough active corps or alliances (or pilots willing to) anymore who go after them.
---
if you can do that on a regular (daily) basis then it will (hopefully) encourage more ppl to do it.
---
Good job though :)
---
So, what you are saying is that TNT is the part that rubs continuously against the top of the tapi tongue in the tapirium arrangement.
---
Ok so what issue are you debating... CCP or CSM ... because if you are on the forums defending CSM's position on an array of subjects and you are being attacked for it...then here's the pitty award. 
---
However you're not.. you mix CSM with CCP positioning and the messaging framework gets muddied. Hence my remarks "Shhh let the CCP adults talk.."
---
You can't sit there and cry about being berated in public for CCP because you take on the accountability but forget to remind people you've not got the authority.
---
Open Comms this week if you want to know more. I'll be there and we can debate this point like gentleman folk if you want. I promise to ignore your ad-hominem attacks out of context.
---
You are over-reacting. He's not 0 tonal variation. 
---
First tried Eve in 2007 and been playing regularly since 2010.  CCP has never been good at managing this game, but they try.  The AT cancellation and the Fanfest shit make me reconsider the "try."  Those are things that are so integral to Eve, the community.  They have generally understood that this is what makes the game, whatever their other fuck ups.
---
Not sure but that's prolly lag.
---
jesus christ this thread is just a slapfest of retards
---
Then get another one and crossfire it up before your first one gets fried by the station interior.
---
people here acting like CCP ( or any other company for that matter) made the game for your personal enjoyment, just because those islandish nerds are nice people....
---
its made to generate cash.
---
it always was it always will be.
---
i was disappointed as fuck when skill injectors were introduced..p2w anyone? ( yeah feel free to shit on me for that..but a fact is a fact)...but hey it generates cash...
---
then those mutator thingies showed up..and i felt like " wait...rng item rerolling? reminds me of..BDO)
---
then  PA showed up..( lul)
---
now we got lootboxes, also heavy rng..also cost u ingame money/items in exchange...mhh...gambling much? uncool. 
---
economical good decision on side of PA? yes. it generates cash.lots and lots and lots of cash.
---
sooo many whales out there , throwing their hard earned real money at PA like it was popcorn in a movie theatre.
---
so in general. stop whining about this shit. its unstoppable.
---
eve will turn into a game played by old whales, retarded multibox miners, rmt bots/alts only, in a pretty near future.
---
 and trust me PA doesnt give a shit about our mimimimi..as long as all the whales pump money into the game and as long as creditcard warrior newbros think they need to invest 200dollars and up, in the first month of playing....( i met a looot of those recently...some aged 13..no fun playing with those kids)
---
TLDR: yeah i give a fuck about rmt dudes. who cares? does it hurt u personal?
---
better have a laugh at those tryhard lowlifers..i mean srsly..turn a game into a job..
---
and as of recently...i guess CCPA gives zero fucks about stuff like that, as long as people buy and use plex .....
---
So I read the TLDR of your post and it mentioned daily content an no major conflicts.  A) Goons have fleets for content all the time B) SIGs/Squads and main fleet have major conflicts consistently. I think your major hang up on Goons is the fact that we are large and doing well economically. I dont see you in Geminate killing Horde or stealing their drones, or where NCPL are doing their mining.  You say you are against large null blocs but only ever mention Goons. I want to apologize to you that Goons have decided to make a region their home and help their players thrive. We shouldn't of helped newbies like me get their toes wet in null sec and thrive. I'm sorry that your idea of EVE is different from mine and you bash my style constantly. I'm sorry that you are multiboxing characters to make money (btw there are a lot of Goons who do this as well without making reddit posts). I'm just sorry for you dude. Like it or not, the null sec powers (Goons) are here to stay whether you like it or not. How about instead of coming here on reddit and bitching about nonsense you just play the game how you play and I will play it how I play? Fair enough?
---
Dont give them ideas like this. 
---
Yeah you kinda started that with the 'buy Sort lunch' retarded comment. I get it, Eve is political and the other guys are the bad guys, but holy shit put that aside for a second and maybe listen to the community you're supposed to represent
---
They have already sold out Eve's reputation.
---
Dude your points are so worthless and misled I cba engaging them. 
---
My point was that I get shit on by your alliance because I post that kind of stuff. 
---
It's simple. One citadel per moon.
---
You then risk getting into issues where players drop Citadels just to "self destruct" them. This was profitable with platinum insured battleships at one point, and it was a horrible "feature".
---
Crying about a free game. You must be fun.
---
I've been hooked on it all week. It's not bad.
---

Currently the value of a salvaged Raitaru is about 150m. Even tripling that would still make it a net loss to the original owner.

Dear Mossy,

Thank you for taking the time to contact me to discuss your views on this subject. Rest assured, I will take your concerns and comments into account as I continue working on these and other issues of concern to our community.

Rest assured that I will continue doing everything I can to represent your interests and the interests of all of those who call New Eden home. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any further questions, concerns or comments.

Thank you for the opportunity to serve you.

---
Took? Well I posted it like 2 years ago but I'm sure someone thought about it even before.
---
For Marshy everything is a Goon conspiracy.
---
I don't think you get it. Goons focused on you in this subreddit because you focused on them just like if you focused on Test or Panfam they would focus on you. You made yourself a target, and you have to live with that. I find it hilarious that you think yourself a victim after attacking a single entity. Get a grip dude, you made this bed, lay in it.
---
I will be traveling back from the summit and a work convention, so it’s unlikely I will make the show this week. Have fun mansplaining EVE to Rahne. 
---
I focused on Goons because Goons dried content everywhere else by recruiting all whales. I am a whaler.
---
But you don't know anything. You are just a new random. I was getting shat on by Goons way before I moved in Delve, or even Goons for what matter.
---
&gt; Who says it's a given that this is the natural progress? Goons vs NCPL had a very good balance. NCPL played the first position...exclusive elitist recruiting. Goons played the second position...mass recruitment. You have a classic quality vs quantity rivalry. Now capital proliferation is insane. It's been insane but accelerated even further in the past 3 years.
---
Elitist Recruiting =&gt; players with the necessary skills (to fly capitals)
---
Mass recruiting =&gt; We will get by somehow (3 years till everyone can fly capitals)
---
So, yeah, it's been accelerated, but it was the natural progression, if you ask me. 
---
&gt;Why are we obfuscating the discussion? You were talking about the easiness of the attacker vs the krab. Clearly the attacker has way more work to put in. He should. But should it really be THAT easy for the krab?
---
The whole point of this little exercise is that you can't eliviate the numbers advantage for just one miniority (i.e. small gangs) without touching everyone equally. All the advantages that are not on by default (i.e. every advantage but local) is a numbers advantage. 
---
And no, ideally it's not that easy for a krab to avoid the hunter. Ideally, we would have a fight but that's not realistic without a fundamental overhaul of PvE. You can't put someone at a disadvantage (current PvE) and then remove the one counter he naturally has. 
---
It makes it a binary thing, which I agree is bad, but it's the way it is. Either you have eazy free kills because you only need to tackle the krab and then you kill him with your gang, or he escapes. It's not pretty, but it's what we have right now. 
---
&gt; I mean no it's not easy to replace, but making ships easier to replace doesn't automatically make the game better. Where does this assumption come from?
---
The assumption comes from the statistics - player numbers and the MER, which say that the average player numbers recovered from their freefall and have been consistent ever since the rorqual changes were made. Also, more destruction and more production. 
---
&gt;And big fleet fights suck. Tidi lagfest. Lock target, press F1. Anyone who has been in the massive fights knows how garbage they are.
---
I can remember times where gridloading took so long that by the time you've loaded the grid after a jump, you were toast and back home already. I prefer tidi a lot over that. 
---
But yes, TidI is exhausting. Nevertheless, Tidifights usually have an impact on New Eden. You don't have that with small brawls. Big Fights often cause significantly bigger waves and that's what I like about them. 
---
&gt;You don't need a cap umbrella. You just need to be able to warp to a citadel since they are in every system and take forever to grind.
---
I agree that burning down citadels isn't the most exciting thing to do in Eve. It's possible though and if you want to stop krabs, you do have the option to do that. Without a place to hide, how many krabs do you think will continue to rat? :) 
---
&gt;But you "have the tools" right? See how this is a bad argument and we should discuss viability instead of possibility?
---
I agree - the viability is the problem, that's what I'm trying to say all along really. The problem isn't that you don't have the options, it's that they are sometimes barely viable. 
---
However, I don't agree that "It needs to be able to be done by 3 people in their dessis" and I certainly don't agree with you that blobbing is not viable. 
---
&gt;TBH caps are the smallest issue out of all that I listed. Citadels are more of an issue.
---
And I would agree - Citadel Spam is disgusting but they are content drivers to some degree too. Not easy to tackle as the current system is pretty reasonable for what it should achieve (i.e. it meets the goals CCP has set). So for me, the question is how they could be changed to make them more engaging and a more meaningful thing, but I don't know how that could be achieved. Pretty much every advantage they offer has a reason to exist by CCP norms... 
---
&gt;Sure it does because the issue doesn't scale. 1 krab getting hit by a 3 man group is different than a 10 man krab group getting hit by 30 people. You notice 30 people a lot sooner. It gathers a certain amount of attention.
---
You wouldn't notice 30 man easier without local, but that's besides the point. For the most part of this discussion between me and you, you've argued that the N+1 advantage needs to go (because all the alliance advantages are N+1 advantages in the end) and I offered this one as a reflection of that sentiment. If you change the impacts of N+1, that would be fine by me. Removing the N+1 advantage is certainly not an option though, as you would need to apply that to everyone and that would be a dangerous precedent for making people invulnerable because they solo. 
---
So yeah, while I agree that some mechanics are hard to deal with (i.e. not really reasonable), removing N+1 advantages from the game isn't viable. So, you will always have to deal with "they have more people" unless you bring more people yourself too. So, your idea of something being impossible because you don't want to bring more numbers is flawed. 
---
&gt;Yes it's a wealth problem as in it's too safe to krab making ISK a lot easier to attain. But wealth is not a replacement for skill. A good pilot with a Kestrel will wreck you regardless of your billions.
---
Yes ofc a skilled pilot can balance out a wealth gap to some degree, that's not up for debate - it's the case. However, the wealth gap is way too large for that at the moment. Since creating wealth in null has done, what I would say, good things to the game (again, MER/Playercount), I would argue to give everyone outside of null a similar wealth.

---
No capitals...
---
CSM is a glorified focus group, not a mediator between players and the company. They can talk about an issue with ccp, but ccp is free to ignore them.
---
Player base representation has always been a joke in the CSM, the current CSM just has taken it too the extreme.
---
Go for it, I have nothing other than hearthstone crap and some shitty Warcraft character lol.
---
"look at me I'm this shiny knight stepping down to talk to the plebs" - mate what the fuck. Yes, I've talked plenty of CSMs, none as full of themselves as you are. 
---
But back to the topic: "I'm not blaming anyone" - Exactly! This is the point. You should be blaming someone (hint: mostly ccp) or at least criticize on a civil level. 
---
And just look at how well loved Logibro was, as a prime example: he communicated, managed his part of the community perfectly with a great roadmap and transparency. He wasn't hated by anyone as far as I could tell. CCP gets a lot of hate if they do completely retarded shit, and I don't like that as well, especially if focused on specific devs. But there are ways around that, and just stopping all communication and going radio silent like the last year(s) just kills it. And we expect you to bring this up with ccp instead of whitewashing it. 
---
I always listen. Listening does not mean that I always have to agree. 
---
Under market conditions right now, yes. 
---
Salvage is an explosively volatile market. I should know, I trade it.
---
It really only takes one alliance putting up a Keepstar and a few Sotiyos to cause a demand shock in T1 salvage.
---
I do not think it is a healthy scenario to have Citadel suiciding ever remotely close to viable.
---
TL:DR - Pure salvage is a poor choice of payout for them. 
---
We are at breakfast right now. Heading to CCP in half an hour. 
---
What a shitty attitude to have, I feel sorry for goons.
---
Give me proof that Goons dried content everywhere else... I'll wait. Cool, you have a grudge against Goons, what reason is that? Give me a personal history lesson professor olmeca. My attitude is that I dont like you because you whine on reddit about null blocs and then just focus on Goons. Btw, I looked up your main in the game and I played the game in 2007 right before I joined the military and came back a couple years ago which is why I called myself a newbie. I knew who Goons were before you.
---
You're missing the point. While you are entitled to have your opinion, your responsibility, and duty on the CSM, is to convey the spirit of the community, even if you disagree with it.
---
We don't need you to act as a filter to pass up the arguments you consider to hold merit, and discard those that you don't. The fact that you are even looking at the problem that way is indication that you have missed the purpose of the CSM entirely. 
---
Why exactly did you stand up for election to it in the first place?
---
The UI is full of bugs, I keep reporting them.. but nothing.
---
The shield booster bug, the messages bug, noticed some others last night but I've forgotten what they are.. these are really trivial simple things too. Ccps Devs seems to be missing any attention to detail. 
---
real talk, sensible balance changes over additional content, and bounties working as wh loot are this guys wish for christmas.
---
Nobody is using agency, as an old bitter vet I don't understand it, it confuses me. It's just more stuff stacked on other stuff we don't need.
---
I think that most of this tracking, achievement, missioning, event, journal, ship tree, mastery etc stuff could be in one single and simple place...
---
You wh'ers are an interesting bunch. I'm really jealous of your play style being able to go to any null sec or low sec in the game reliably to find content. 
---
That said, I can't do anything about people who are blue to us using caps but if you actually went there because of my post, I'll follow through and make an actual list of people not respecting the guidelines to the region. 
---
Technically, if the defenders just undocked and fed a few t1 cruisers, that probably gets the roaming gang to leave faster and they can get back to ratting, than having to drop caps and protect them from some counter escalation while they are stuck on grid. 
---
BBTB doesn't eat chips, or whatever you call them on your council estate.
---
Whaaaaaat? botters outside of delve? surely you are mistaken! are those in The Imperium supposed to be the one and ONLY bad guys in eve online! botting, scamming, lying, cheating, oppressing and input broadcasting bastards outside of delve surely can NOT be a thing! or is the rest of eve just seriously salty and constantly pointing out Goons and forgetting to point out the assholes next to themselfs?
---
You also gotta remeber it is still a game and where is the fun in having a safe null
---
I saw them used occasionally in wormholes. A Kronos or a Vargur can do some damage vs a few BCs.
---
Rarity though.
---
Are you going to be ok?
---
&gt;I focused on Goons because Goons dried content everywhere else by recruiting all whales.
---
Well that's clearly a lie.
---
Again, I am not here to discuss shit with a random.
---
But you can check Rorqual/Carrier lossmails of alliances like FCON, SOLAR or Shadow of Xdeath. See where they are now. 60%+ of them will be either Goon or Test. Those alliances space were a beacon of content. A way higher percentage of their total farm converted to killmails and content (about 25%ish) compared to the rate than Goon farm converts ([goes between 3-5%](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1goutrhQADKczT9MLzA47Crdf3JwsVu5PNDHKN_qIvTs/edit#gid=391531178)). It's not a coincidence Delve/Querious does 50% of all mining. It's because all miners moved in there, under ultra safe conditions fully protected by the capital umbrella. It was not so long ago [total brain dead people couldn't titan rat at 0 velocity](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/382628401) on stream and be completely safe from any kind of risk. That's a new thing. That's bad game design. It's not even a Goon issue but mainly a CCP issue. Yet every Goon shitlord with half grasp of this game learning to hate us in their comms, then coming here shitting on us, and CSM totally ignoring legitimate balance concerns doesn't help. That's on Goons.
---
PS: Its pretty childlike how you compare char creation year with me. Has nothing to do with anything. I have older chars than my main too lol. All I was saying is that me raising balance concerns and Goons shitting on me go back 4 years, and you are just a random who know me by my booshing and Delve deployment, which is about 10 months old now.
---
no i think im going to need some oxygen
---
Was tempted to do this when I won, but with cheap minerals and ease of mining supers just arn't worth what they used to be.
---
This sub needs upload filters!
---
According to sov.space DV already gave away all their space to TIKLE.
---
They gave most, but not all. They still have their 5 "main systems" if you want to name them that wy.
---
Ahh, may bad. Didn't check dotlan. Damn sov.space and not showing all the alliances owning sov!
---
something something goon conspiracy
---
Ok, you mostly blame a CCP problem on Goons. Sorry we meta gamed the shit out of this sandbox? Sorry you are so butthurt at one Alliance/Coalition that will react in kind on a neutral forum? Honestly what do you expect when you come on here with anti Goon stuff? Do you expect Goons to be like, yeah this guy is super badass, I'm going to upvote everything he does! Get real man. Additionally you brought up the whole I am a new random (aren't you a random too) whole thing which is true in a sense but I just wanted to make sure you knew where I was coming from since you started that whole thing. That's on you and it was pretty childish imo.
---
I only agree with the first part, as I don't see a problem with "non focused"-expansions.   
---
But yes, there has been a small timeframe when CCP started communicating a lot. DevBlogs, Forumposts etc. it all felt that the developer would open up (after his recent fails to adress the communities will). And it seems that now, CCP is heading towards that direction again. Communication seems at a low and especially things like the chat-system or other problems aren't openly adressed by CCP except for a few short lines.  
---
It seems work with the CSM is finally going good, which I really like to hear, but there is a lot of things missing. The EVE community is very special and very harsh at times, but it's at least a big missed opportunity to not include them in the developing process.
---
So I agreee with the general idea/concept of the OP. Focus more on the community, it is what EVE is about in the long run...  
---
I'm not missing the point. What you said is exactly what I do. That does not mean that I do not have my own opinion or that I am not going to express that opinion to folks.
---
At the same time, it absolutely is my job to act as a filter - should I pass on bad ideas just because a player suggests it? If somebody tells me we should buff Rorqs, make botting legal, remove WH space, or something else I should just pass that on because somebody suggested it?
---
Why not take your own advice and go away?
---
Well wollari doesnt really have the time to remove outposts atm, and sov.space still uses outpost data to create the map (outpost systems have more influence than "normal" systems), so there's that. On the other hand we habe more than 130 alliances with sov, perhaps it's alright to not have every single 1man alliance with a troll tcu on it
---
Great. Thanks for the input. 
---
LOL!!!
---
 Where is the video evidence that this is a bot? Are you completely idiots? 
---
If you think the CSM members only push agendas forward that benefit their own alliance then you are really short-sighted.  
---
You know the worst enemy of any alliance (no matter how big or strong)? A broken game. A healthy game is always good for your own alliance - no matter where you are on the food-chain - and a unhealthy game is always bad. So, everyone is interested in a good and working game. Also the ideas of how that looks might differ of course.   
---
I 100% agree.  Ill probably get flak for saying this but a great example to go by imo would be to follow Old School Runescape's (kek)  ingame polling system.  For those unfamiliar, before any updates are added to they game they are polled using an in game voting mechanic.  It makes players feel like they have a voice and they do.
---
It's by no means perfect and there's some controversy surrounding it but its a way for the developers to connect with their player base. Its a way to keep the devs from blindly pushing updates and hoping they got it right.  It may be exactly what Eve needs.  You could put it in all stations/structures right next the the ship insurance tab.
---
I cant comment on CSM and the duties or effectiveness, but in this case it may be better not to use a middleman and give everyone a clear shot at voting for content.
---
Thought the same. And makes sense, since abyssal space has the highest graphics requirements
---
i know i had to stop running abyssals because of the constant socket disconnects.  i only have the problem in abyssals, nowhere else.  my system is very up-to-date and definitely not a half-rotted potato so there is something going on with the sites.  i followed several suggestions in the hopes that the issue could be resolved but nothing seemed to work.
---
It will do exaclty the same if they bridge 10 bs if you are in frig / dest : it s a no match and you need to leave the grid. Not the problem directly of capital. You attack someone in their home, where they have almost all they assests, it s normal that they can outnumbered and outperformed you easily. 
---
At least you choose to roam there in small ship.
---
Ye was thinking the same. I think i got a huge tank  the only thing i am scared is socket closed i watched alot of vids now and i know that you can get all time and will a different spawn but if you manage to get close to the neuting bs fast its not that hard to do them
---
&gt; We are whalers. We play to explode ships and do it in most intelligent, creative, epic ways possible.
---
Nah mate, you multibox CD's doing the same thing day after day, sorry to tell you but you're a turbokrab doing it in a different way.
---
&gt; We are disgusted by the powercreep craze you turned this game into.
---
TIL olmeca thinks I work at CCP.
---
&gt; And we despise how inexperienced unskilled credit card warriors are allowed to farm under extreme safety
---
Confirms again that folks like him want it easy, same spiel i've heard for 14 years.
---
&gt; while their best accomplishment is joining an alliance that recruits everyone.
---
You're really salty about it aren't you, how dare they take anyone and not be elitist pricks about it while pressing the same f1-f4 as everyone else.
---
&gt; We are here to put a dent in that safety. 
---
Cool, get back to us when you do.
---
&gt; We do what we take to be our mission pretty damn well. And more importantly, we have fun doing it.
---
Just what a turbokrab would say isn't it.
---
&gt; because you can't deal with us in game.
---
They deal with you so well you cry on here daily about how your insignificance is a problem for you.
---
&gt; We couldn't care less which alliance dies or lives as long as the space that is supposed to be dangerous, is dangerous.
---
Sits in one region for years, doing the same thing over and over, pretends it's not about one single alliance when any with a brain are doing the same but olmeca goes nowhere.
---
&gt; We will be more vocal. We will kill more ships. We are not going anywhere.
---
Thats good, maybe eventually you'll achieve something other than krabbing.
---
please OP,
---
define ' Awful role of dreads in the current meta'
---
also IMO, change on or the other when it comes to cynos and carriers/supers. either application, OR cynos.
---
its hotdropping that makes people think its capitals online, maybe just a cyno spool up is fine with some cyno inhib tweaks?
---
ban capitals weapons in lowsec? please dont say this is even on the table.
---
i for one want subcap pvp to return, i, as part of a smaller group i hot drop, rarely. but its fun i get it, but i dont go roaming in a yolo battleship because people just will hotdrop it. boring. but i still think capitals should be scary to sub caps. but somehow make it so small roam groups have time or can escape the capitals before they drop.  blops is fine as you dont need capitals to kill those.
---
For level 3’s it doesn’t matter really about minmaxing the type of damage you do against what rats. I just run with Imperial Navy Praetors, heavy Amarr drones.
---
Noone in the community at this moment wants anything other then this game to stop being shit. Some of us have been playing since the golden ages and want new players to have that same chance. At the fuckin moment the CSM is pointless and CCP is doing the square root of jackshit to show they are committed to making this game any better.
---
No instead we get a half assed event, and machine gunned terrible false promises that have gone on for years now. CSM is supposed to be our voice and we are pissed and that needs to be made clearly and directly to CCP even if it goes against your own "ideas" we put you there.
---
42 out.
---
&gt; Technically, if the defenders just undocked and fed a few t1 cruisers, that probably gets the roaming gang to leave faster and they can get back to ratting
---
That's complete bollocks though isn't it, if someone gives you a fight instead of a turbodunk you tend to go back for more fights.
---
You make them not want to come near you with a barge pole, not feed them table scraps to kep them coming for more.
---
Tbh I'd like to ban supers (and maybe even caps) from lowsec.   
---
Not to punish lowsec, but to make the region unique again. It needs to be a middle-ground between high- and null-sec and right now it's just a playground where your supers are the most safe (no bubbles and stuff).   
---
Following your idea and banning capitals completely from lowsec would achieve your wish and wouldn't create the need to push new regions into the game (it's there already). I'm pretty sure the rest of the mechanics are fine.  
---
Only problem that would be, is that a lot of the travel routes for capitals are cut - which I'm fine with. A capital ship is an investment and traveling with it doesn't need to be super easy...  
---
TL;DR  
---
Ban (super-)capitals from lowsec.  
---
mansplaining ... you're just digging in deeper aren't you :) lol
---
&gt;These are all things that CCP controls...
---
Are you sure about that considering the pa acquistion? 
---
Ccp want it to be player driven
---
then you sir, do not pvp. 
---
presuming f1 pusher / cearbear / isk collector or of course. in goons/snuffed
---
Now see, that was heart felt...  now off you go... 
---
Well, most roamings are meant to kill of ratters and miners, maybe a small response fleet.   
---
If you would expect roaming fleets in a certain constellation, you would bring a really big fleet in to kill them all - you do that 3 times in a row and nobody roams there anymore, as there is no reason to kill your fleet.  
---
The idea sounds nice and people would love it - but the reality of EVE is that fights being "set up" don't really work within the universe. You need a second world to do that - like the AT (RIP) or some arena style stuff they are experimenting with in abyssal space.   
---
Running a juvenile fallacy argument doesn't lend credibility to your position.
---
The danger with acting as a filter is understanding what exactly you are filtering, and from where you are drawing the lens to view that problem through. Is it coloured by what the majority of the player base's wants? Is it colored by your own experience as a player? Is it colored by the concerns the members of your particular sub-group of players raise?
---
In your fictitious scenario, if the greater majority of the player base you interacted with was echoing that something needs to be done to make botting legal, would you be in a position to filter out that opinion if your view was coloured a different way?
---
Your opinion is certainly valuable, but what is even more important is being able to present an opinion you may personally disagree with but which is still a concern raised by a subject group. And I'll make things easier for you: the subject group for you is the player base at large; so populist concerns should be raised.
---
I would be very disappointed if monetization concerns, lack of price corrective actions for PLEX, and concerns about the future of competitive PVP in EVE were not prime topics raised at the summit - they may be exaggerated view points but they are legitimate, widely held concerns for the player base.
---
Make all hulls insurance payout jita price including t2, leave cap insurance as is. 
---
It is definitely laggy, and its not graphics lag.  I can run one client at 144 FPS, \~50ish ping, and it is still very inconsistent with orders going through quickly.  Its esp noticeable when you accidentally get too close to the red border and try to turn around, sometimes it'll take 2-3 seconds before your ship seems to acknowledge the order.  I also often have times where I have to F1 2-3 times because it didn't seem to go through.  This only happens in the abyssmal derpspace, and it is not consistent, but quite common.  I have a feeling they're using subpar hardware for too many instances.
---
Lucrezzia you must delete all history oc this comment off the internet. What have you done?!
---
The recharging gates sound like a fun idea to play around with...  
---
Not for regular gates of course, as that would just dry out the system/region affected, but for certain things that could be really fun :D  
---
This or a lowsec gate to Stain :P
---
IF you ban capitals from lowsec, it wouldn't be a big deal to change over the gate guns to fit the new "role" of the space...
---
I saw how you handled yourself on twitter. 
---
lol, as in the EVE of olde there were more players?  
---
The early battleship "fleets" had 20-30 players. "We" now easily field hundreds of subcap pilots. So it's surely not about missing players...  
---
You're preaching to the choir. I think it's been clear that I have been willing to present ideas I don't agree with over this term. 
---
I get why we ended up with 50% goons on the CSM, but I still don't think it's good for the game overall. I don't mean, that we should replace goon CSM members by other nullsec power blocs, but the current CSM while representing the majority of players, is not representing the majority of playstyles. 
---
What are goon reps 4+5 bringing to the CSM, that 1-3 aren't already? At the same time, how many lowsec, WH, highsec, FW, small gang, whatever CSM members are there?
---
I think the CSM could be a lot more useful if CCP announced before what the development focus of the next term will be in broad terms and have people specifically apply to that. Say, elect 5 of the CSM members the classic way and then have 5 slots where CCP wants player insight on specific topics. 
---
The other day my drones kept going idle and then re engaging, but on random non primary targets so i had to keep spamming F to make sure they kept on the same one. Something's fishy i think.
---
no. I'm not going say much else.
---
Well, if a burglar breaks into my house I'm not throwing away my 9mm only because he has a knife and it wouldn't be as much fun for him...  
---
Why expect a defending party to form for an even fight? That can only happen in an arena-like pvp system. EVE is not that, so you won't have even fights (except for accidents of course \^\^).  
---
This is kinda natural behaviour.   
---
If I start ratting, the activity I like to do right now is to rat. I don't want to PVP or roam, I want to rat. Of course, since I'm never safe from it in EVE (which is good), the PVP can find me. In that case, I will try to find the easiest and shortest way out of the PVP situation to get back to my ratting activity. Usually that means killing of the agressor with a bigger gun (or let him pass). Both is not fun for the roaming party, but what do they expect?  
---
What game are you playing? Can't be EVE, where SIGs and squads overflow and people roam and hunt around all the time...
---
I'm almost sure it's not a network lag, but a window loading instead. It needs to fire up a whole secondary renderer to show your character's head moving. Why do we have it again?.. I'd like to have my carefully posed static character portrait back, especially if it would mean I wouldn't have to wait 20 sec every time I open character sheet after opening a client.
---
WTB Community Team and Seagull please.
---
Why I love EVE so much is the meta game. The big politics and battles, the diplomacy and power blocs and all that kinda stuff. That's usually not for everyone and most likely not the thing that interests new people.  
---
I think what you should try is the other way around of what you described. Do the PVE solo and the PVP in fleets. At least for now. You will find a lot of fun in fleet fights and understand the game and mechanics a lot better. The experience and knowledge you gather in those fights can help you with your small scale PVP later on. And if you are consistent in your PVE, you will finally be able to fly big and shiny ships.  
---
Being part of one of the newby organisations like Horde is the best thing you can do in your position. Try making friends there you play with regularly and communicate with them. Set your own goals and try to achieve them.   
---
Once you feel it doesn't work out anymore or something is in the way of your goals, don't be afraid to look for greener lands and new friends...
---
The omega upgrade helps a lot and if real-life money is not an issue, I would recommend you try it out for a month. Especially because being alpha limits your ISK-making abilities a lot  - so a lot longer until shiny ships are available to you.  
---
Not sure about that. But it's clear as daylight he's saying the truth about this scum. 
---
And I can't stress it out enough: Play with others. Don't play alone. Chat, talk and communicate with other players - that will help and bring the fun.
---
Why are you suprised?
---
RMT is rampant in the imperium, why do you think so many bots exist for otherwise?
---
No, you don't lose any skills if you unsub. But as long as you stay subbed, your accoutns still acquire more skillpoints.  
---
So it's basically the "maybe I will play it at a later point"-rescue robe those people like to have.  
---
I hope this is an OK place to ask: I'm a very new player, interested in mining/industry/market and such. I always hear eve is better played with friends - what are some good corps for this kind of stuff?
---
[Inferno begs to differ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kED11aGobUk)
---
&gt; Should I be going through wormholes yet, or just stick to low sec?
---
Go into wormholes, sites are much more valuable there, it's worth the extra risk. Make yourself a midpoint save and dirscan each second. Leave if you see combat scanners. A cloak is more convinient, not necessary. The most vulnerable time is while hacking in the sites, and there you can't cloak anyways. 
---
&gt; What am I supposed to do when enemy npcs show up at my sites?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FPELc1wEvk
---
There are no rats in sites with "Angel", "Blood Raider", "Gurista", "Sansha" or "Serventis" in the name. Exception: If the name contains "Covert", it's a "ghost site". There the cans explode if you fail a hack and after a timer some rats will warp in and trigger the explosion of all cans. You'll be quite save if you hack only one can and then leave immediately.
---
&gt; Will I be attacked in low sec, or does it not matter either way?
---
Players will attack you, there are no NPCs in sites (except Ghost sites, see above). You have local in lowsec - you are save if alone in system. If there are a few dudes, you can check their killboards if they often kill exporers. Don't run sites in populated systems.
---
&gt;What ship should I be aiming for that could take out the npcs and still be effective at exploring?
---
None. Stratios and T3 cruisers CAN fight sleepers in low class WHs, but they are very expensive, you should know what you are doing before taking these,
---
&gt; What level security should I be exploring in as an alpha?
---
Easy and most profitable: Join a null corp in Sansha or Gurista space (Brave Newbies, Pandemic Horde, Dreddit/Brand Newbros) and expore in their home territory. Going to lowsec and wormholes pays a bit worse and is more challenging - maybe it's more fun for you, though.
---
&gt; Is there a ship that could handle the NPCs that spawn when exploring without being super expensive?
---
Drake, Myrmidon, Vexor Navy Issue can run sites in C1 and C2 wormholes. Scan first in your frigate, then fetch the battlecruiser to run the sites, maybe switch to the frigate again to hack the cans. The hacks are very easy in sleeper sites, so you can also bring a mobile depot and refit data+relic analyzer in the site (you may need both in sleeper sites, their "data sites" also have relic cans sometimes).
---
&gt; Will I be attacked at all in low sec?
---
See above. Most dangerous are gatecamps. Best practice: Deposit your loot in stations in lowsec, use a fast aligning frigate to transport it to the market (Atron, Slasher, ...).
---
&gt; Difference between low sec and null sec?
---
Null sites are more difficult to hack and contain much more loot. Null has no gateguns and bubbles, which makes gatecamps much more dangerous.
---
&gt; Are there better paths than exploring? Or just what else can I do/what is everything else like?
---
Exploration is probably the best ISK/hour for low skill characters. If you have fun, it's probably the best.
---
EVE is dying - since 15 years...
---
socket disconnects are related to network code and not graphics settings. For shits and giggles, check your Task Manager &gt; Performance window and see what's being stressed the most, WiFi or Graphics. You can further check your Resource Monitor &gt; Network &gt; TCP Connections and find exefile.exe and check Packet Loss. Keep a log and when you get a socket disconnect, refer to the log and see if it was due to a TCP connection failure.
---
Your a line member. I create stuff, you follow.

he shot the things till it exploded 
---
Holy shit 10/10
---
IIRC, back in the good old days, before CCP Fozzie and all his ~~brilliant ideas~~ flinging shit at the wall to see what sticks, the CSM was larger, had more of a voice, and was guaranteed to have reps from high, low, and null-sec. I don't remember quite when they lowered the number of reps, but I agree that the CSM should rep all playstyles.
---
Why does everyone here think that CCP are actually interested in removing bots?
---
This is probably the dumbest idea about fighting bots that I've heard yet. jesus christ, this is almost as dumb as citizen journalism.
---
bots = revenue and/or a stick to prop up the pathetic pcu numbers
---
That's not the problem 
---
The problem is rorqual and vni bots inject them all before applying, and get around the falloff that way. 
---
Lmao oppressed by miners, what a dummy.
---
according to his page you also get 100 *Raider Points* every 10 minutes that he streams, and 10 plex = 1500 points    
---
after some napkin math, if you just open his stream, let it idle muted in the background you make 4 plex an hour..... totally worth it 
---
Have you *seen* that activity tracker? IT POINTS OUT THINGS THAT YOU DO IN THE GAME! WHY CCP WHY
---
im with you. everything that these """""""""""""developers"""""""""""""" have done the last couple of years has done nothing but infuriate me
---
id do it for free*

*just pay me in a cut of the botters confniscated isk
---
2-3 seconds isn't normal? 🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺
---
Literally any alliance needs people to produce what they need for fighting.  Any corp you join would still like for you to fight on occasion but if you contribute to the war chest you will be protected anyway. The larger the corp or alliance the better they will he able to assist you with things like starter ship, skillbooks, logistics, etc. Wormhole space requires a cloak so you wont be getting in there as an alpha but a few weeks as Omega is all to really need. lowsec has some big faction warfare corps, npc null has groups that run missions and explore relics, and sov null has groups ranging from one or two constellations to entire regions and almost every one of them has need for pilots of all levels. Be warned if industry is your thing it will be veeeery hard to turn a profit in highsec as it's highly populated and its resources aren't as valuable. Eve university has campuses in every security type of space and would be a good one to look into at the beginning. 
---
Sounds like the tick time to me the server only ticks every 2 seconds
---
Don't worry, CCP devs don't read this sub anymore! They're too busy planning what to cancel next after dealing with fanfest and AT.
---
I've been saying since its implementation skill injectors are a p2w mechanic and the gateway to a future with loot boxes. But the vocal mongoloids assured us it wasn't p2w because you are going to 'welp your ships with injected requirements'. 
---
I'm going to simply ignore Reddit from on and try to enjoy the game I love until I can.
---
I find it funny that you think CCP has a roadmap at all. Look at their updates page. It is completely empty. They delivered the "stargates" (and forgot about the new space and colonization part) and think they are done now
---
I don't expect anything other than more stupid PvE "festivals", more pink premium skins and more monetization efforts.
---
It's a good idea,
---
Not practical. CCP has weak defenses and a twitchy hand for easy money.
---
Hmmm... You've been talking to Sort about me :) 
---
We exchange an intellectual set of opinions / ideas

Rahne can handle herself. But you should be aware of how you're being perceived. And I appreciate you sharing your perceptions of me. 
---
I think making another character even if it's just to run the tutorials is a good choice tbh. 
---
Yeah, I've seen this too.  Drones sometimes get very unreliable in the Abyss, and this has been an issue since PTR, where I ran a ton of them.
---
How bad did you get suicidd ganked?
---
The hamsters have been removed from their wheel and they are coding at ccp due to staff shortage. 
---
\^ yep
---
The prophecy has a command ship big brother called the Damnation that is very popular in wormhole space for brawling. Both ships lack mobility, but are great brawling ships. 
---
For PvE ships like the Vexor or Gila are favoured due to a mix of speed and their drone bonuses. 
---
Solo PvP you're going to get dropped on big bigger things or blobs a lot if you're in something slow, most solo ships are fast kiters that can pick and choose their engagements carefully. 
---
How about being elected for your ideas and what you think you can bring to the game? Or how you could be an efficient bridge between a playerbase you understand and a dev team that don't listen?
---
You haven't been elected Prom Queen...
---
\^ This.
---
Sorry about this, but as we all know, botting is a huge problem. Unfortunately it affects all of us.
---
What's stopping ccp to just put 30k in the launcher when they have 20k connections? 
---
He wasn't trying to prove it, dumb dumb. Just sharing nice visuals of it.
---
What would be the point of proving it here anyway? Just kill them, and then report them to CCP so they can (not) handle it.
---
That deppends. I will give you a example. I run a 3 month old corp called Academy of the Unseen Arts. We currently have 330 people in corp and growing. My vets are returning people that love this game and i mean love this game and so all my new bros that come in with wide eyes we help firstly settle down with the game and then help them grow into the areas they intrested in.
---
We dont push any narratives and CTAs. When I asked about what they intrested in the last thing on the list was PVP. Ofcourse some where and we take those out and die in a ball of glorious fire. Sometimes we even get kills but you know what we having fun.
---
This game is so diven towards null and their big battles. Super alliances that now seem so stale. I dont feel sorry for any of the null sec people. I actually feel sad for all those new bros who went there just to add numbers to a ever growing machine.
---
I encourage my new players to lead fleets. We had a new guy lead his first ever pvp fleet on saturday. We died in a ball of fire but it was amazing to see how as the night went on he started to get more into it and just relax.
---
We having fun. This is a game. You pay money to sub. If u not having fun then ether stop playing or find something else or somewhere else that will give it to you.
---
I'll have an article up on that in the coming week or so. Look out for it :)
---
Wow, very constructive. Thanks for your input.
---
yes .... years ago :-) when there was some old forums ...from ccp!
---
I guess their track record shows you are right.
---
Im honestly suprised to see people use the german local for the client, i have mine in english bc that makes fleets and describing things easyer    
---
german btw 
---
Talk about waking up in cunt mode.

Just knowing what is happening this year? For years we'd had a rough roadmap- What's going on?
---
  Devs hardly ever post on reddit anymore (frankly given the last 3 weeks I'm not surprised why), but we need to see them interacting more here.
---
gg can't even watch it at all. well done.
---
Cyno primary secondary warp align shiptype
---
All you need bby
---
People may not have brought it up all the time if CCP had said "Hey we think walking in stations isn't really that important after all so we're going to cancel it to work on x y and z instead" instead of "Oh hell yeah that's a super cool feature that we definitely want to work on and we're super excited about working on it Soon!"
---
At least back in 2014-15 we had a massive road map with sov, citadels, structures &gt; removing POS towers. We haven't even got to removing POS code, yet there's nothing on the horizon.
---
because "achievements and lootboxes" unironically
---
I just think sub caps need a better ability to disengage. Like there was in the nano days. By the time your cyno is lit I'm already 200km away and warping to the next gate while you still have fatigue. 
---
That's how I ran. I was one of the only folks that put out a platform. 
---
Did it matter? I have no idea. 
---
I see nice art, I updoot, I am a simple shitposter.
---
Its not half the player base its half of large entity with the organization, and prefilled ballots of who to vote for to maximize returns. At max, they represent 2-10% of the player base of eve.
---
We need to bomb the shit out of them 
---
It's also a difference in training time. The former takes dramatically longer to train than the latter.
---
have you heard of battleships before
---
To reduce the spamming amount to get faster to the marshal BPC... Its suppose to be about science, not about getting the marshal BPC as fast as possible.
---
Exactly. It's got a lot more graphically-intense pretty, even if it's not more stuff-heavy to make that obvious.
---
I can play on middling settings in general, but in abyssal, everything must be cranked to the floor to get the same performance. Yes, my PC is shit, but it works (mostly).
---
I recently cancelled my subscription because the game runs so badly on my machine now. I'm not sure what changed but one of the patches a couple of months back left the game borderline unplayable for me, constant lag everywhere and targeting from the overview stopped working reliably.
---
Cache cleared and freshly installed client with everything downloaded made no difference. My machine is a bit on the old side so it may be hardware related but I've given up trying to work with it for now. 
---
Must be friends with the team from rs3 rather than osrs going off of their community interaction
---
I'm trying to learn-and-earn my way up by ratting/salvaging in a Catalyst. For some of the harder Serpentis dens I have go attack them 5-6 times before I can clear them out, each time warping back to repair my ship in-between. Often I lose all my shields and half my armor ring in just the first 5 seconds. This gets really tedious.
---
What's a good way to reduce the amount of "warp back and repair ship" I have to do? Should I just use a hull repair module, or is there a better technique to prevent ship damage, or at least buy me a little more combat time in-between repair runs?
---
Right now I'm splitting my guns between antimatter charge (seems effective at 5-7k) and Iron, which lets me attack from &gt; 10km. But even with this I'm still getting lit up before I can even pick out targets and set my orbit.
---
And thats not the same as he is licenced seller by CCP, so its not the same
---
it's not our job to go after them, but CCP's.
---
Very nice. But i get a real kick out of seeing Bombers Bar falling for a trap and whelping.
---
I have literally zero drawing talent, I often wonder how people can draw things so well, thats really good. I'd love to have a load of hand drawn eve ship prints in my man cave one day, although I never see the Proteus, is it harder to draw?
---
That post is really good, but I still think inhibs need more than a 300km buff. The HP layout needs to get fixed and I'm not sure a 15s delay (5s delay covert) would be a bad thing IN GENERAL, as it makes cynos a lot less oppressive on things like nano cruisers(and down). You now have a few seconds to try and get away before the hammer lands.
---
Brisc, pls, mention the new killmail system. Do it for your logibros :(
---
Make harvester drones great again!
---
So its a viable alternative than injecting another rorq.
---
And give lowsec / fw some love.

you are bringing the wrong tools for the job mix up the comp with some ECM and anti fighter frigs and destroyers and you can kill a cap with a small gang. your thinking about this game in a weird way my dude, nothings nearly as simple and you make it out to be

Wow, this is what I needed. 👍
---
A zero effort response to a zero effort post. Looks good to me.
---
Big oof on that
---
Hm... another nice response from TEST. Keep up the quality of the sub boys.
---
Yep everything they've done in the last 6 months is about adding lootboxes to a subscription game... that's pretty shitty if you ask me l. They can make bank with cosmetics but they don't seem to want.... Pirate hats and parrots when?
---
Hah, appeal to pity (argumentum ad misericordiam), on one hand you almost landed the hubris but you just couldn't help taking one last little swing on the way out with the perception fear, uncertainty and doom. ... I mean, firstly you introduced Rahne into this conversation let the record show, then you bait-n-switch when that plan fails to stick. So to recap you've tried to introduce Sort with some red herrings, then its Rahne with an appeal to gender authority but in doing so you had to throw her under an intellectual bus (which is poor form on both counts given you know these two in person?...even for Eve standards that's a low road to walk).
---
All this pivoting and avoidance measures is dizzy, but circling back to the original points... just...go in knowing...you're not CCP.. say it like a mantra when you see a community member say something positive/negative about CCP...fight the first instinct of answering on their behalf but instead ask "How does this advance the player base forward as a member of the CSM"...
---
You're a smart man Mr Brisc, but this was a weak intellectual exchange... but... i guess i'm probably still mansplaining mode with you? (see what i did there, i cast aspersions over your pronoun.. hey if you're going to tar me with the misogynists brush may as well get a free kick?)
---
Last night I was scanning a chain of WHs and found a number of holes with 4 WH connections.  Is it normal for C1 thru C4 class holes to have their normal statics plus wandering wormholes for a total of 4 exits?
---
I lived out of a C1 or C2 WH a few years ago and I never recall seeing more than static(s) + 1 additional WH while I was scanning.  Something has changed, right?
---
Add an R. Impregnancy
---
I’d love to fly one someday... someday.
---
NPC Titans spawn in sanctums. Though, I bet the rate is less than 5%.
---
You should use all the same type of guns and ammo on your ship. For example on a catalyst if you're using railguns use all of the same type of railgun with the same ammo so all of your weapons can apply damage at the same optimal range. You can carry different ammo in your cargohold to switch out if targets are too far away. You also want to try to minimize the damage you take by increasing your speed, reducing your signature radius, and increasing your resistances. 
---
Serpentis deal exclusively kinetic and thermal damage so put a kinetic and thermal armor hardener on your ship. You should also use an after burner to increase your speed there by reducing any incoming damage. Don't use a hull repairer they are very inefficient instead use a small armor repairer and only activate in pulses to reduce the capacitor drain.
---
All of that said catalysts and destroyers in general don't have much tank available and if you train towards a cruiser you will find it much easier.
---
Its my resting cunt mode face. Why ... too much? :D
---
Or we could all be very apathetic and call it "Please ignore Goonswarm"
---
I thought Imperial Legacy was pretty much the official name of the megacoalition?
---
Or if you'd have Dead Terrorists join  the coalition, you'd have DeLeRium.
---
Nope that is normal. Sometimes you can find wormholes with 7+ connections. At one time there was a bug that meant someones static kept respawning, until they had a few hundred static wormholes.
---
It makes too much sense 
---

YEA BOIIIIIIIIII thanks for the vid and gf &lt;3

good stuff man. keep em coming
---
Just out of curiosity, do those models include travel time?  I'm sure it's just the Abyss, but my medium drones are almost always on a cruiser or larger while the missiles work on ewar frigates, and travel time is real and sometimes painful.
---
Irrespective of that, what I was pointing out so poorly is that the community's wishes and concerns get translated from the nuanced - something like "is drone damage balanced with other medium and large systems?" - to the blunt.  In this case, "nerf gila, and maybe the rattlesnake while we're at it."
---
This pacifies the playerbase, who are always calling for something to get pounded into the ground, without ever addressing real balance.  This is how we get to a situation where one or two ships dominate for a given application, which is how we get to "nerf gila" or whoever is next on the merry-go-round.
---
Maybe they need to ignore the CSM entirely and get a balance team.
---
Plug the corp name, CEO name and alliance into Google and see what pops up. Also ask the recruiter what they like about the Corp and the people in it and why they joined and see how you feel about the responses.
---
because low sec incursions payout in isk, which means it is just another option that is comparable to other isk making opportunities.  But if you substitute a resource and make it scarce, people will fight over it.  
---
same here.

We sould add subtitles to his vids

Thank you for engaging. gf

Why would you send your questions and concerns to the CSMs now without any input or direction from CCP? While the role they play is to provide input and concerns and ideas on various player bases behalfs, they are not in any position to pitch anything new to CCP. I thought the role of a CSM is simply to represent the players with regards to what CCP will be putting into action. I thought the CSMs have no direct input to CCP in terms of "our ideas" and that CCP has no commitment whatsoever to hear any of our "ideas" or suggestions.
---
Is this not how it works? 
---
Like I thought the power a CSM has is very small in relation to any change they can envoke regarding anything that is not directly in line with CCP's "vision".
---
Looks awesome! Much appreciated! 
---
&gt; folks remember it and use it as an example of CCP being shitty and not following through on their promises. 
---
Because the new priorities aren't things the playerbase in general want. Tiericide, T3 balance etc. are things we want.
---
It's actually super useful. I'm not going to share my secret but I'll give you a hint. I only open it once 😉
---
CCP should run drug tests, top-down :)

The UI was moving from functioning to useless, at warp-speed.

1 carrier should beat 10 destroyers, it costs 10x more and is 4 ship classes bigger. However it cannot tackle any destroyers, so if your destroyer fleet gets wiped by a carrier it's because you didn't warp out.
---
BRO
---
sell some of the shit you have in highsec, and go join Pandemic Horde or some other newbie friendly alliance. They will teach you PVP and you can make good ISK there aswell, time to get out of your comfort zone and try something new :D thats the beauty of eve

So I recently joined goons after coming back to the game after a long break, bought a super cap and what not, and do null sec things; however, for my first 6 years of eve (2006 to 2012) I was a low-sec pirate/small gang pvper, and for us BCs were absolutely part of the meta. 
---
I love EVE
---
Isn't that what got the game in to the situation it is currently in?
---
Maybe, but in all honesty the best way to say it is you are cutting off your nose to spite your face. 
---
That's great feedback, let's take it offline.
---
A non-representative focus group is still a bad focus group.
---
Bugs are a feature. Nothing to worry about.
---
It's a bit heavy alright :D
---
I actually thought this would be relevant and related to the new Russian Coalition, I vote Dead Winter Co, since you can't get much more winter then Russia (and they want to kill frat / Winter Co) 
---

---
Whatever will I do?!
---
Do you edge with your brother often ? 
---
I will say the agency could do with an overhaul (I had to have my bf explain how to search for anything beyond the suggested content _twice_ before I picked it up), but it is useful to newer players. I use it to find the nearest agents for whatever corp I'm working on rep/LP with since I can set up the filters and just leave it open to refresh on each new system. Yes, Dotlan is way better for finding hubs to work out of, but if I'm in a rambling mood or running Distro missions to maximise storylines, being able to instantly see if any viable agents are in system when going through my route is pretty useful.
---
So
---
this post is the real test
---
True but not what I was implying.
---
There has been a noticeable shift away from people actively seeking fights towards relying on singular 'content creators'. This usually shows as people "waiting on a ping" or "sitting on a bridge" rather than finding that fight themselves.
---
Some many people currently want "to be on the killmail" or to get instant pvp without putting any effort in. I get it, it's effort, it takes time that some people don't have and some people just suck at finding fights. At the same time it saddens me too.

There are many ways to become better at drawing. A good start is to just start sketching things you like the look of. Don’t concentrate on getting every little detail accurate but more the overall shape and composition roughly right. Keep doing it and you’ll find it easier and easier to visualise on paper what you want to express.
---
hm, i can write and understand english fairly decently, but for the usual TS/Discord bants i would prefer a German community, are there any german Corps for complete newbs?

The bill makes no reference to "real currency", only lootbox mechanics, prohibits updates which introduce lootbox mechanics unless only available to players over 18, and requires a warning to be posted on pages where purchases can be made.

That’s kinda like Overwatch in CS:GO
---
Basically, you get assigned a “case” and watch a few rounds of someones match in CS:GO. You then check a few boxes at the end if they are a cheater.
---
You might be wondering, how do valve stop this from being abuse? Or from bots spamming this to get XP? Well, they put in solved files to test whether people can “spot a cheater”. Or, they put in people they know are innocent to see if people are randomly spamming boxes at the end.
---
I think it would be a good idea, but it’s not like CS where you can just record people playing eve, and plus who tf would want to watch someone rat for hours.
---
But I do think getting the community involved in SOME way is possible.
---
Less video games, more ice fishing.

Agree with the OSRS polling system. Even just FEELING like you’re affecting development is a big plus.

This is simply wrong... RMT bots are HURTING their revenue, by alot.
---
A. Plex/Isk etc sold by bots is lost revenue through the official CCP sales channels, as buyers that buy from botters, would have bought plex instead. Plexing botters don't give ANY revenue to CCP, as plex sink is not a cash relevant process for CCP, only the Sale of Plex is.  
---
B. Inflated Plex prices, increased use of Plex because of botters, cause the Plex prices to rise. This forces out players that play the game regularly, as they have to grind too much. Any actual player lost, is a potential customer lost. Even if a guy always plexes his account, he potentially (and most likely will) buy something off CCP eventually, like a XMas present for himself. -&gt; every lost player, is a lost revenue source
---
C. Damaged gameplay, as soon as the gameplay is damaged, by unfair mechanics, botting etc, more players will leave/not join eve. Again, more players leaving-&gt; less interesting game -&gt; more players leaving etc. Eventually, again, player number = income
---
Sounds like some stupid idea California would have come up with. 
---
It's time to take warning labels off everything and just let nature take its course.

Holy shit. Get rekt! Way to keep em honest!

Utter bullshit.
---
Not sure i understand the downvotes. Zkill only shows squadrons destroyed, and only applies the value of 1 fighter to a squadron. It is well known by some, but not to all. Melgrath hits it pretty accurately in the post below.
---
Min/Amarr warzone is active, and I'd recommend it for solo PVP.  
---
Every PLEX sold is bought off CCP. No matter how you purchase it, someone has originally bought it from CCP. So it doesn't matter much for CCP what happens with the PLEX...  
---
The price of PLEX is an interesting thing. Prices going up means less people buying PLEX for ISK, but also more people buying PLEX for real money to sell it on the market and vice versa - so both should be fine/healthy for CCP as long as neither reach an extreme treshold that causes the system to collapse.  
---
Botting is still something CCP doesn't like because it affects the health of the game. Not by ISK/Plex sold, but by the market being inflated with too much ISK and stuff...
---
Thanks!
---
You are trying to argue with a fucking real life politician. Het gets Paid to lie on a daily basis.
---
Don't need to worry about and invest in the UI - if you have no users. Problem solved for CCP.
---
German speaking corps are generally shit. 
---
FW is still good for fights both solo and small gang. I recommend joining a FW Corp to help aclimate to whatever area you're headed towards and give you staging options.
---
I'd recommend staging in low sec to reduce reship times on losses.
---
Also, if you're focus is purely solo I'd recommend trying some off-meta fits. The surprise factor is especially potent in 1v1 bc if someone is coming to fight you, they likely have a plan based on how you're fit. Example: Kite Fit Punisher. People expect brick tanked brawl punishers, or barely fit plexing punishers. So if they come to fight you they will be fit to counter that. 
---
Loot box mechanics are just rng loot tables.
---
Literally every game with npcs has this.
---
It's buggy and laggy as shit. Sit in one station with an agent, it never shows up on the agency no matter how you set the settings. Ever. Been that way since it was released and I've sent multiple reports, not fixed lol. Agent never shows up. I've asked multiple people to look and nope, never shows up there.

It has something to do with a series of studies that I am too lazy to go find that basically said an adolescent mind that is exposed to a loss/reward system based on RNG inside a digital gambling system causes irreparable harm to the development of that young person resulting in a lifetime of issues.

Again, I used the word "technically" and I think very little of the actual reasoning so I am too lazy to find it.

You already tried to argue this, remember?

he must be asleep, he hasn't banned me yet

Open the agency to incursions, open it again 30 seconds later and you get a different list of systems while sitting in a station/citadel. Makes perfect sense.

Try using an algos, it has an extra mid slot which you can put an ancillary shield rep in, which helps your tank a ton. Catalysts are built for dps at the expense of everything else, so for most purposes an algos will be better

Thanks for the reply. I'll have to look at corps ingame I guess, since r/evejobs is pretty much full of WH and other non-LS posts. I've tentatively picked a lowsec system near the corner of heimatar that seems to get the most activity, and definitely will enjoy some different fits for the surprise factor.

nope.opressed by current game meta and superior isk generating via hordes of rorquals and fun facts like losing less isk on a dread then on a somewhat blingfit solo battleship or marauder.you are the dummy here if you dont see that, vOv....
---
It's almost as if communication is shit. 
---
Like often we literally have to guess if a project is cancelled, that means often people have no option but to get pissed until CCP give comment on if something cancelled/finished or not. 
---
Now the biggest issue is that honestly balance just isn't a priority for CCP and where stuck with at best like 4/5 yearly patches.

TAPIRIUM
---
How can I get access to the Level 2/3/etc missions? I have completed (I think?) all of the level 1 missions, and the Agency just keeps re-offering the same ones. At one point I started on the Level 2 combat missions, but now they no longer appear in the UI (I let one mission I was working on expire, so maybe I lost my standing?)
---
I'm just having trouble understanding how the UI is supposed to work here; it's not clear to me how to progress through to the new content without repeating the same missions over and over.
---
Tapirium
---
I didn't argue anything. I pointed out some basic facts.
---
&gt; If you think the CSM members only push agendas forward that benefit their own alliance then you are really short-sighted.
---
optics matter here, like the CSM could be pushing for changes that actively hurt there alliance but given a majority of the changes benefits alliances with CSM members and well the CSM statements are almost impossible to find ( because by the CSMs own admission the notes are often wrong ). 
---
If you pay real money for in game items, even if it goes through a third currency like the “raider points” or you have to gamble to get stuff instead of buying it outright, it’s still RMT and it’s still banned 
---
It doesn’t count because you can’t buy the loot boxes with real money. Maybe this would ban stuff like the new event, or the boxes that drop from npc haulers, but it wouldn’t effect 99% of the game 
---
Testostium, the most manly coalition in New Eden? ;)
---
Are you saying olmeca and marshy are lying to us?
---
To be honest I really like the russian mentality in general. They are good for Eve, and their genreally resilient and loyal attitude is something that a lot of other groups lack.
---
I wish them nothing but success. Eve is better with a strong russian block, imo. I'm just sad that it's against Fraternity, who I also like, and not one of the "bigger" blocks.
---
So are you saying that when I "purchase" a bookmark to a 10/10 DED site, run the site and find an officer module in the wreckage of the last boss, I participated in gambling?
---
What if I "purhase" an abyssal filament instead? I run the site and find random loot in the cans. Am I a dirty gambler now?
---
Or if I buy the best super in the game, the Hel, and head to an anomaly and a faction rat spawns. It drops some nice faction module that I can now sell for 1 billion ISK. Did I gamble here when I "purchased" the ship and used it to get a random reward?
---
Same applies to these "lootboxes". They're bought using ingame currency and have random rewards, just like the boss in 10/10, the abyssal site or just plain old anomalies.
---
So yes, "purchasing" here refers to real world currencies, as governments don't even attempt to regulate virtual currencies in games.
---
Acording to this br pl was allied with goons in fighting ph. Not unconcievable in 2019.
---
If it bans the new event, it bans npc drops.
---
They are the same thing. The only difference between the two is when you roll he random number generator.
---
Imagine you could sell unlooted npc wrecks in the market. Welcome to what the lootbox from the event is.
---
So it's the miners 15 minutes after your years, seems like the miners handled being oppressed way better than you do.
---
IT'S A CAPITAL SHIP
---
It only applies if you can spend real money to get the loot box. Since isk can be bought with plex, you can treat anything that you can buy/sell on the market as a lootbox, along with other stuff that requires isk, like the new event. 
---
It would not apply to npc or exploration loot
---
it was more like FRT + SKILLU + VOLTA + PH + NC. + PL + BL vs TEST + GOONS + REST OF IMPERIUM + REST OF LEGACY.
---
To me that looks more like not trusting people.
---
This post is low effort...
---
But you can't buy the loot box with real money. Without a multitude of intermediary steps
---
This is going to be an issue with any game that has a mechanism to buy in-game items with irl cash that aren't bound to the buyer.
---
Carrier warp speed or Interceptor ? 
---
It's just a bill. Besides CCP should have no problem hiring Texas lawyers by ISK (is this RMT though?).
---

I started roaming 70% solo/30% small gang in the Amarr/Min FW zone three months ago, so all of the following advice is from that experience.
---
* If you've spent nearly no time in low-sec, I actually think the best place to start would be on a small gang roam with an experienced pilot or two who can teach you the basics of FW mechanics, where to find content, etc., before you start roaming solo. It will save you a lot of pain.
---
* I have mixed feelings about giving advice as to whether you should join a lowsec corp or not. The ideal situation would be my own: having experienced players as friends that you can get advice from, but being in an extremely small corp so you can have more people to shoot at. If you're posting here, however, I'm assuming that you don't have friends experienced in lowsec solo PvP, so a corp might be a good idea.
---
* If you're really looking to get better at PvP, the best piece of advice I can give you is to record every roam you go on, and watch each fight you get afterwards. Frigate fights are over so quickly that it's nigh impossible to realize everything you've done wrong in the moment, and recording fights has really helped me to identify and fix patterns that will repeatedly lose me fights.
---
* Bringing Solo Back is in-game channel that a lot of solo/small gang pilots frequent. While it's not the best place to get advice from, it's a good place to lurk, at least.
---
There is probably a dozen other things I'm forgetting to mention, but I hope this helps! If you have any questions or want to talk about specific questions in greater depth, feel free to hit me up here or on Discord (Jaylus Toralen#8630).
---
It's a storm in a tea cup.
---
For example the latest Event boxes, that you can't directly buy for irl money, that give you a random item that you could have just obtained the exact same way you obtained the event box...
---
It's comical how bent out of shape people are getting over a total non issue. 
---
Mhm... *Creates account, states person is over 18 when person is 13... continues to get loot boxes* 
---
Dont know about you but I always said I was over 18 online when i was that young. Who the hell is going to know? Or just move to Wisconsin like I did. Gotta move to the right side of the state ;p

But this is no dumpster... 
---
Mate, you can carebear in nullsec if you find a good alliance/corp and join them on PVP roams/battles. I used to be live in highsec, but sold all my stuff and took a shuttle to my new nullsec home. Haven't been in highsec ever since. 5/5 would recommend.

Like a momma looking after her children. 😍
---
but but but WHAT ABOUT THE CHILDREN!
---
\&gt;  It would not apply to npc or exploration loot 
---
Of course it would. You need to buy a ship, for which you need ISK, which you can buy through PLEX. Then you roll the RNG at the can after the hack and you're gambling again.
---
Thanks for the reply. Your situation does sound like it'd be nice, but yeah, my time in Eve has been everywhere except lowsec, so I definitely don't have experienced pals to lean on. 
---
When I said I know next to nothing about FW and LS, I didn't mean it quite to the point that I don't know about dscanning plexes, or the theory behind (if not the practical experience with reacting instantly to) the different sorts of FW fits and positional advantage, or other stuff like that that I can find stuff to read up on on. I know there's a shitload more to finding fights, avoiding getting baited, recognizing my opponents and their probable fits/tactics, and so on, than I can learn reading reddit posts and eve uni guides and whatever. But I wonder how much "pain" there can really be in welping t1 frigates and fits! Lol :)
---
Love the tip about recording fights. I was planning to do that.
---
Thanks again!  
---
We wouldn't have to worry about them If people put ad much effort in to making their lives better than using them as an excuse to go on pointless moral crusades about things that are total non issues. 
---
Oh, hang on this isn't fixed by having said character thing be closed does it? (that might just mean the character stats themselves are the source of loading problems)

The problem tends to be that nobody wants to say something is cancelled because there's always a chance that they come back to it at some point.

---
I understand that folks that can only afford VNIs or Munnins wouldn't understand the trust involved with Titans and other big ticket items.
---
In a game that is built around salt and scamming people, it amazes me that people are somehow up in arms against RNG - something that forms the basis of every single bleeping loot based game.  
---
&gt;I am 100% for transparency and for communication. At the same time, it's important to recognize that there are simply some things that CCP can't share or shouldn't share with the community before those things are ready for primetime. Some of that stuff includes things like long-term roadmaps, because those are always subject to change and this community - like most - views almost anything that CCP says as a promise, even if it's couched in the vaguest possible terms. The community also has a ridiculously long memory, and loves to bring up promises made and broken over the years continually.
---
Can we just stop spewing those lies?
---
They dont talk because their arguments cant stand public scrutiny.
---
&gt;and this community - like most - views almost anything that CCP says as a promise
---
Cant say I have ever seen that. Maybe you are confusing it with accountability?
---
The issue is it trains the community to read delay's as cancels ( see recent AT stuff how that might backfire a bit ). 
---
It also leads the community assuming cancelled if they don't see updates.
---
Ironically it's there own lack of communication that often leads to the community reaction, when they do communicate.
---
(Wormholer btw) If you think adding MTUs to the equation solves anything, what makes you think adding literally two steps (move loot from
---
MTU to cargo, pull MTU) is going to slow bots down any? Hell, with mtus as cheap as they are they can skip that part too, it’s not like stocking a million MTUs in a hangar to resupply costs anything significant. 
---
What are you gonna do instead, loot the field yourself? Assuming site payouts stay the same it’s literally not worth your time to wait for an mtu to tractor in 20m worth of garbage.
---
What a garbage idea. The only reason it works in WH space is because the high site payout means forcing someone off their MTU/site allows you to potentially collect that reward.
---
You should deal EM against Rogue Drones, but tank mostly against explosive. For other pirate factions it's always the same thing - e.g. against Angels deal explosive and tank against explosive.
---
Some drones deal EM and Thermal damage, though. So you should have at least some tank against these types, too.

Whenever I do that I remember the Battlestar Galactica and its wall of projectiles rising up to meet, and completely destroy, every single attacking enemy craft that cross it.  So that's a hard No from me.  CCP just need to remove HAW and things like Bosons from the game.  I remember the first time I saw Dreads taking on subcaps.  I was like, "eh?  How do their guns hit" (I missed the whole HAW thing, apparently CCP made it happen).
---
But then you ask, what's the point of caps if they're no threat to subs?  It's a good question; one for someone with a bigger brain than mine.
---
&gt; opressed by current game meta 
---
Aside from a snippet about rorqs the rest of your original post is just gibberish, I'm not going to bother trying to piece together something sensible from it.
---
&gt; superior isk generating via hordes of rorquals 
---
A rorq huffing in a colossal makes about 120 mil/hour, which is about 1.5 VNIs or the same as the blaster Nagas that was the ratting meta 6 years ago. For the cost of a rorq and its injectors you can inject a fleet of VNIs and make more money, or you can move to highsec and run burners for twice the isk/hour.   
---
Just about every PvE activity gets you more isk/hour than a rorq.
---
You aren't being oppressed by rorquals in any way.
---
&gt; fun facts like losing less isk on a dread then on a somewhat blingfit solo battleship 
---
Jeez, how much isk are you spending to bling out a solo battleship? A decent HAW Revelation costs about 3.5 Bil, insurance saves 2/3rds of the hull costs, which give a loss of about 2.6 bil. If you are spending 2.6 bil on a solo T1 battleship then the problem is very much between your monitor and your chair.  
---
Even on a marauder, which isn't even a PvP boat to begin with, that amount of bling would be bordering on the unreasonable.
---
Capital insurance is a complete non-issue, if you are insuring caps for anything other than a suicide dread or fax you are wasting your money.
---
Feel free to demonstrate how a lootbox doesn't contain an rng loot table.
---
Is CCP’s logo being your drain symbolic of how this game is circling the drain?
---
CCP really didn't have that much to do with the development of the current nullsec meta.
---
The "fortress" style of PVE was a pure strategy evolution that was not triggered by any single mechanic change and emerged spontaneously years before the jump drive, Rorqual changes, capital rebalance, etc as a synthesis of then-new fleet sentry carrier tactics and drone PVE.  This was just the first form that proved to be viable, though.  The conceptual foundation for the meta can be characterized as the collective realization that there is a third option besides just letting people die and disorganized hangar clearance escalations.
---
In that context, what you're really asking for is CCP to change the rules of the game to mitigate player developments for your own personal convenience and bawling like some brat in the supermarket who dropped his lolly because they haven't.
---
Yo I like this bill. It prevents video game companys from using predatory micro transactions on minors. 
---
I can dual box on ultra during TiDi fights, and my PC chugs trying to open the Agency.
---
aye.
---
Just quickly added a last point to my comment, which I honestly think is the most important thing to take away from all of this :)
---
That's good to hear! I still think going on a small gang roam or two to get acquainted with an area might save you some frustration and allow you to more easily find viable fights (e.g., which systems are most active at different times of day/where to find content, which characters smartbomb pods, if you try to fight this dude solo he'll bring in an ECM ship and jam the shit out of you, these dudes are always down for honourable 1v1's, etc.)—  but that said, these definitely *are* things you can learn on your own.
---
I'll DM you about relevant corps later today.
---
he gives out 100 every ten minutes, but my guess is it only goes to one person and not everyone watching.
---
ahahhah nothing to brag about it just being insulting because you cant actually play the game and style trying to actually understand the mechanism of it is a bit frustrating don't you think..
---
NPC rewards != lootbox mechanics
---
that's what i'm saying.
---
I agree, which is why I push them constantly to provide more updates and do more communication. But the problem, as I noted originally, is that there is a catch 22 when it comes to communication - the community does not always reward more communication and often deters it, which makes folks less willing to be communicative. It's a vicious circle and it's difficult to find a solution to it. 
---
I mean I’d avoid it even if I was elite smallgang PvP because why the fuck would you go somewhere just to lose your shit? The new abyssal PvP stuff offers a direction for this and honestly if Faction Warfare offered better rewards for actual PvP it probably could as well.
---
If you want fights for the sake of fights then you’re also gonna have to live with the gudfites mentality and all of its warts. I just don’t see it happening now.
---
As long as suoer dnt get used by either side these fight be enjoyable and fun for all :D
---
I wouldn't sit in a newb corp if you're looking to optimize fittings / learn about modules.  Sure you can try to figure these things out without assistance, and given enough time and effort you'll likely succeed - but you don't _have_ to do this alone.  One of the most important aspects of Eve Online I think, is finding a group of people which whom you enjoy interacting and who can help you with things like this. 
---
As far as stagings and corps go, it really depends on the timezone. If you're USTZ (00:00 - 05:00 eve time),  then I suggest you apply to Dirt 'n' Glitter, my corporation.  We're a FW based corp staging in Huola (lowsec).  We offer logistics service that runs almost daily to import whatever frigate fits you desire, and we have a pretty vibrant slack (out of game chat server), in which people theorycraft and optimize fits.  If you'd like to give us a try, we actually have a small roam undocking tonight around 01:00 eve time.

---
That is indeed the joke
---
It has been years since injectors were released. The associated problems have not been addressed. Players see the damage they do. CCP does nothting. How many years of patience do you think players should have? What about bots? Do we have permission to be angry yet?
---
&gt;and it's been four years and people still bring it up to complain about it. 
---
Because it is important and nothing is being done. CCP disagrees? Fine. Make a convincing argument so the community can "understand". And what the fuck happened to the balance team? There is legitimate greivance here.
---
I don't mean it has to be 100% fair, it will never happen. But if supers and titans dropped on small gangs would be less effective it would be good first step. And it would encourage the defense to form up, so more content for them as well!
---
Thank you that really helped me! 
---
so much this. i dont know why they circlejerk about their killboards so much.. i always get mocked from so called vets when i solo them in a fair fight. 
---
They dont wanna do that because the devs (or senior management) have completely fucked up ideas. Posting those ideas would establish without a doubt they are retarded. This is ultimately what is being protected when they refuse to communicate.
---
Is it banned?
---
Make it happen always when there's a supercap/titan on an anom, spawn a response ship of the same class (so super get's a super, titan gets a titan), with a decent bounty but with a damage cap so that you have to shoot it for, let's say - 20 minutes. Oh, and make it point the largest ship running the anom so that you're either killing the spawn or losing your ship.
---
Introduce it in wormholes.
---
The fucking elephant:
---
&gt;Quant mentions that the game design and economy changes after skill trading and plex is very complicated due to the monetary exchange involved. Such as players buying supercapitals and the skills and then it being nerfed for the sake of a healthier game.

I'll love to see response fleets like this be something along the lines off t3c fleets with maybe recon support. as you could bridge around them pretty easy an they could be set up to do just about anything.
---
But even a standing sub cap fleet would be better I sure there's plenty off titans siting around doing nothing that can bridge.

Sub cap fleets could be so much more versatile at defence if only people you no work on it.

I'm only familiar with the Galmil/Calmi warzone. Activity has died off a lot as big alliances on both sides as well as some pirate groups left the warzone. BUT, it's still a good place to find 1v1 fights and it seems to be rebounding from the lowest point this past fall.
---
On the Galmil side Villore Accords the most active alliance staging out of Villasen and to a lesser extent Nisuwa. Salt Farmers seems pretty active on the Caldari side staging out of Kehjari. Looking at zkill United Fleet also seems active on the Caldari side but I'm not active at the same time I'm not familiar with them, I think they're based out of Kinakka.
---
I think the devil is in the title
---
Why are you using a DDA if the ship is meant to PVE ? I use a really similar fit on my PVE astero, but i either switch the DDA for a inertia stabilizer to warp faster. Other than that, it look pretty fine imo. Also, you have \*NO\* tank at all, you can't expect to fight much in this anyway. You could always switch the Rangefinding array for a extended shield booster instead, this might save your life agasint smartbomber. Have fun exploring !

Maybe, buy why the instant payout? Even if it does mean you need to do the extra steps it still means more time for a payout, and because of additional handling it means you have 2 scenarios where you could potentially lose the loot.

I know you you guys are under NDA but are you allowed to even say if you are getting anywhere / any sensible changes being made? 
---
You could probably fit a stratios to do C1 data/relic sites but youre pretty limited to just those unless you throw considerable bling at it. C2 data/relics have decent neut pressure for a solo pirate cruiser and 3 out of 4 do over 500dps while also webbing you (so you can warp out but you need to be ready for it since alpha is a real thing in wormhole PVE). Probably possible in a well fit strat but there are way better ships for this. The astero is off the table for these sites. 
---
Usually, wormhole data/relic sites are run for their rats' blue loot and not the loot in the cans. Their worth quite a bit more in general when compared to their respective classes combat anomalies and they have to be probed before they can be warped to. This is nice because a sabre can't just enter system for the first time and warp straight to you. You're not safe in these sites by any measure (they can be previously scanned, have a cloaky camper waiting, etc) but they're probably the safest way to krab in wormhole space. It's also worth mentioning that at least in higher class sites, the relic can loot is rather large in m3, making it difficult to get all of it home (don't know about lower class because I've never done these there). Nestor battleships are sometimes used in C5 space, for example, to clear and hack these sites because of how large the loot is and how difficult these sites are. 
---
If you like exploration, I suggest finding unguarded relic sites in C3 space - the ones with factions in the name like Sansha. The astero fit you posted there doesn't look half bad for this, but I'm sure someone will tell you how to min/max it more. I've always just priorized speed for getting around the site as fast as possible but since you need to balance survivability, speed, scanning capability, and a little combat, into only a tiny number of slots, I think you're off to a good start. 
---
If you want to do some combat and then explore, I'd scan yourself a small chain of a few wormholes, bookmark some sites you want to run, and then take a combat fit ship in there to do them. Bring your astero through after to hack the cans. 
---
Good luck, and remember to dscan like your life depends on it (because it does). 
---
If your drones are set to "aggressive" and there's an anti-drone pylon, that's probably what's throwing them off.
---
Finally, someone gets it.

If goons are just based on carebearing, why do I get so many goon pings that I'm considering uninstalling Jabber? If they were just carebears it should just be QRFs a few times per day right? So why am I getting like 20 pings a day?
---
Your issue with goons is literally that it is large and efficient. I don't get it.
---
Thanks for the write-up. So far I've been using them for damage mitigation in citadel bashing, but I guess there aren't *too* many other applications for it :P.
---
I mean if your gonna sneak around commit to that, if your gonna fit commit to that generally doing half and half will result in being bad at both. 
---
Low effort. 
---
Thanks. Yeah that's pretty much what I've fit them for. Cheap citadel bashing battleships without cap penalties. Someone else mentioned AB nightmares, which is valid.
---

I get that, but eventually there have to be some material suggestions beyond "it was better in 2014". If everything is just "Screw CCP", eventually, CCP will go from not looking much to not looking at all.

Ironic coming from a skillu guy

SR member here. We were kicked for the reason because we had supers. The reason that they are not telling is that we became too dominant within QFC and SMA wanted our territory and they were better friends with goons leadership then SR. This doesn't make sense for me, because SMA gained all our territory and gained half our corporations within SR. They are now even more dominant then SR within QFC.
---
Did you post this on the eveonline forums? I kinda see how a communication issue might be forming.
---
that basically sums it up
---
Intelligence 1
---
I would have made a wooden loot box
---
I don’t disagree, but other than that were you suppose to help or you just wanted to tell me that I’m doing wrong?
---
Yes it is SC, say welcome to the "Vulture". RSI is copying the ship and the name. Very creative
---
#PLEASE PISS OFF BBTB...PLEASE
---
I am tired of peace and BBTB is an instigator or barometer of war. He rallies the dogs and dangles meat in front of the hungry.  
---
So excited right now.
---
looks like TheBastion too
---
i mean false flags would get you punished and your % payout rate lowered (think of it as project discovery 2, but you cant spam "no bots here") 
---
How much did you need to pay in SC to say that?
---
True on both of these, but since the optimization updates I get a steady 40 fps in there. I can tell it's not graphics lag, feels more like the server tick rate is different in there.
---
Cool, I'll keep you guys in mind.
---
TIL I should play on potato settings if I want responsible UI. 2019 is nice.
---
I wish we could. What I can tell you is that I am still feeling good and we're almost at the end of the first day. 
---
Thanks bro. :)
---
The bird Vulture too, is a CCP invention and the nature is copying it shamelessly.
---
Because there's pretty much no usage for Marauders and even Blops are struggling right now.
---
1. Always warp @0 of suns.
---
2. Always be decloaked
---
3. Say hello in local when you enter a new system
---
4. Don't forget your shiny modules, it make your ship faster in wormhole space
---
Thanks for the link, that will really come in handy. Also this fit, is it viable for any of the combat data/relic sites or is it mainly for exploration with a chance to defend myself?
---
They are helping by telling you what you are doing wrong.
---
Still a better project then any CCP is currently doing
---
Do you have a "clear vision"?
---
CCP does!(n't)
---
I wouldnt bother with combat sites in an astero. The dps is too low and even if you make it it will take very long. For combat exploration i like a tengu. It has to be semi blinged. Can be flown very safely just dont be predictable in it and stick to deds in nullsec not wormholes.
---
Ironically, it doesn't light on fire no. It runs at a comforting constant 65 Celsius, providing that much needed heat on those cold winter nights. AND it gets playable fps in the abyss, and doesn't chug when opening the agency.
---
Black Rise is still pretty tasty for solo and small gang. 
---
m8 you're not doing a good job of dispelling the "goons want to destroy the game" myth that seems to bother you.
---
In Horde are a few Germans who can als will help you. 
---
i dont see birds design here. but you probably right
---
I mean, yeah, lag spikes/client desync is a thing lately, but specifically in the abyss it feels like everything is quite a bit less responsive. May be better nowadays, I haven't done any in a while.
---
When Upwells unanchor they're basically "packed" and ready to scooped back up again by whoever comes across them. The dude who stole it was planning it for months. I must say he was a nice asshole. Had a chat with him, he was actually a nice guy, but an asshole for doing this.
---
It wasn't that much of a loss for me, since my CEO in that corp sucked at CEO-ing and overstretched our infrastructure by putting down shitadels every few meters in highsec, it was only a matter of time until shit like this happens. After that I packed my stuff, gathered whoever remained from that corp and started a fallback corporation. I was the most experienced player in the corp as a returner, so I knew what can happen when "Eve happens", a lot of the people I took over probably would have gone inactive.
---
I actually don't blame the thief, but the CEO for those who decided to leave the game over this, for having failed to provide us with an environment.
---
However this fallback was short lived, as I had to take a break over my landline suddenly dying out on me. Fortunately someone else took over and started a "fallback fallback", which was made of my old friends and a bunch of new faces when I returned. I'm not the CEO anymore, something I'm definitely not made for, I probably wouldn't have meant good for my peers in the long run.
---
Now we're living in Null and doing whatever we want. Life's good for us.
---
That does look very nice tbh.
---
Well, this is interesting.
---
not as interesting as the cancelling of the AT.... just saying
---
I understand, but simply telling a newbie they are wrong without directing them isn’t very helpful is it? I made this post exactly for that reason, because I felt I’m doing things wrong.
---
Gons numbah won
---
Wow that’s very detailed, thanks so much! 
---
Thank you, I will keep that in mind. Appreciate the help 
---
That’s a cool story. I like the idea of a small group of knowledgeable people to play with.
---
There is always some people online on the horde, but I don’t get that personal touch (except a few interactions I had).
---
You're not doing a good job of recognizing stark hyperbole.
---
I actually see this when I send drones after something going really fast, like the drifter cruiser a few events back(rip cool events). They'd chase it for a bit, then give up and go after some other rat. Same when a garmur and stiletto tackled me in a vexor, put warriors on the stiletto but they end up chasing the garmur.
---
Now if we reverse the meaning of each thing you said that would be a nice advice from you hahaha
---
What happened half-way through the month that caused character isk to drop a bit?
---
Higher class wormholes  have more "invention" blue prints in the cans but it's not significantly bigger in volume. They essentially all contain invention blue prints, data chips and carbon.  People will typically run them in Nestors because the DPS and alpha is high, not because of the loot volume. But you may have an issues looting all the cans with a frigate once the site is cleared. They are much harder than a normal combat site. You will find very similar things in the higher class data/relic sites as in lower class wormholes but just in more numbers or with a better value because you get more runs or a better chance of successfully inventing the bpc. For example, a "wrecked "invention" blue print will yield less runs than an "intact". "Intact" invention blue prints also have better success rate % than the wrecked ones for example.
---
Statement which appears ambivalent on the surface, yet shallowly hides a humble brag upon further scrutiny.
---
Everytime I read threads like this I think to myself "why haven't I been nothing this entire time instead of dualboxing supers for 8 years when I need isk"
---
mar5hy's 2 dreadbombs have clearly crippled delve
---
Well hopefully they actually want to fix all the shit wrong with eve at the moment and are actually trying to without being blocked by tape.
---
I started playing this game 2 weeks ago. Loving it. I wish newer tutorial videos were still being made regularly on YouTube. 
---
I lot of older videos still apply I think.
---
I did all my career agent quests and now heading to the sisters home base to do the 2 career agents there.
---
Could definitely use a sense of direction. 
---
Here we are
---
Appreciate the clarification. Haven't run these in a long time - just remembered clearing one a while back and not being able to get half the site into my frigate hull. Good to know though. 
---
You don't; you never could. Lowsec will become livable again by reducing the impact of the problematic, game-wide mechanics.
---
I don't have a new button, maybe it's just me. I only have 3-4 buttons on the neocom that didn't change and anything else I use the hotkeys or menu to get to.
---
All the cloaky camping, excavator booshers, dreadbombs and general harassement in delve clearly works
---
He's about to get booped.
---
The fact that the active isk delta is -95T even though it should be +58T does that mean that 158T have been removed by the GM's because of botting or other stuff?
---
64 regions in Eve, 63 regions in the report - again.
---
It also removes one thing I can think off. Heavy fighter bombing as you'll end up blowing up all the loot.
---
You can't really conclude that from the data. Maybe it would be much more without them.
---
Personally I would love it if local was removed completely. But a 2 minute delay would be a good compromise. More than enough time to kill idiots and bots, competent players can still use Intel to escape.
---
just walked back home and have fits for your astero as I think you might still have time to train for t3c
---
My go to astero exploration fit was this, it's surprisingly tanky, should survive 1 mach smartbombing, aligns under 2s and i got out of a few very sticky situations in it. For the tengu, I use HAM's 2, fit costs 1.5bil with a zeugma on board, it is great fun to fly, if you don't do mistakes you cannot die except to a log off trap (don't be predictable)

whats missing?

name checks out

I was in LORDE. I know how terrible your fleets are.
---
yeah, for me the art is mostly in seeing its art and the details a person includes is part of who they are and what they see - because everyone has their own unique perspective.  
---
Though it can be hard to not concentrate on the small details!
---
Just join RvB or move to wormholes?
---
Critical riparte intended in jest, but which risks being misinterpreted and downvoted by opposing faction. 
---
We still won the race, even when the other teams tried to sabotage us.
---
Of course it would be more without it. The discrepancy between #1 and #2 is still so large its insane
---
I have had this same opinion. Give us a roadmap. Please, give us the opportunity to hear from this new "trio." I want to hear CCP's vision of Eve Online.
---
Cache isn't on the report.  Although to be fair, this is better than a MER last year where *both* Cache and Fade were missing.
---
you spend a lot of this video not doing anything idk if you noticed
---
:ok_hand:
---
&gt; The discrepancy between #1 and #2 is still so large its insane
---
[this slide has the faucet/sink/active isk delta]
---
from what I understand the "active isk delta" does include GM actions against players but also accounts inactive so long they are removing them from inclusion in the data
---
In relative terms it was both much safer with perfect play but also much more interesting before CCP started fucking with shit.  The shield dream fleet which was starting to emerge as an optimal solution prior to the rebalance was absolutely ludicrous compared to anything that exists today in terms of turtling and making damage good when completely immobilized and vastly outnumbered.  In most ways the "buffs" of the capital balance pass which expanded the capabilities of the capital classes as a whole amounted to hard nerfs for this doctrine which already uniquely had equivalent capabilities.  With near certainty, what you would be facing today as a nullsec meta today if the last few years of changes did not happen or were rolled back would be virtually the same in terms of defensive strategy, but with much grimmer prospects against the shield doctrine that evolved concurrently with the defensive strategy and had no known vulnerabilities.
---
It's much simpler now as you just push a button and get 7 minutes to have a wank or respond with a solo fax in many situations, sure, but isolated capital groups are much weaker with the reliance on fax and limited damage dealing options which are very vulnerable to attrition, and more vulnerable to dread escalation.  The old school cool shield dream fleet could burst upwards of 200k ehp/s on a heated X-type rep primary for every Chimera or Wyvern in the fleet, meaning they could soak dread bomb damage at &gt;10:1 numbers with as few as 5-10 players, and much of the rep coming from the &gt;100m ehp heated Wyvern core which was entirely infeasible to target to reduce the rep as fax are now.  Peak cap transfer of &gt;1500GJ/s per fleet member and sustained net surplus &gt;400GJ/s -- the tank could be sustained indefinitely and both distributed or focused neuting is futile.  Thousands of sentries with assist mechanics and cruise blap levis, forms of damage that can't be removed to simplify the attrition scenario, and high alpha or with mechanics that trivialize coordinated volleys allowing threshold to be reached at low single digit fleet sizes.
---
There are recordings of small shield groups (5-10 players) engaging hostile fleets numbering in the hundreds far from support for hours before an escalation could be organized.  Say what you will about the current balance scenario, but under no conceivable circumstances would 5-10 Rorquals or any other small gang of capitals face any outcome other than certain death being mobbed by hundreds of players under current mechanics.
---
Ya'll don't even know the bone CCP threw you with the balance pass and just keep crying for the bar to be lowered even more. CCP throwing the bone in the first place is part of why groups have consolidated and there are fewer isolated targets.  Players don't just keep doing the same shit that makes it trivial for you to kill them when CCP makes a change.  You need to very carefully consider what the next most cancerous thing players can do if CCP treats the last cancer, because that's exactly what they're going to do.  If players run out of new forms of cancer to turn to, they're just going to stop playing.  CCP will never be able to surgically alter the game so that everything you enjoy about it remains the same and the only difference is that now players are forced to feed you kills because those players are voluntary participants in what is supposed to be a form of entertainment.
---
Everybody was watching the AT....
---
CSM where CCP thinks they can pay off a few people to keep from talking and being informed on thousands playing the game. It's cute.
---
Mate I love your videos. I like that you put text informatiosn into your videos for people who don't know what is happening. I also like your alliance that you like to take fights I hope you never disband or get to big and cripple yourself.

I'll be honest i am just sitting here hoping they banned accounts and removed Botting isk worth 150T... not enough ofcause but it's something
---
i like the unexpected things in eve, stumbling on an out of fuel pos, getting jumped after you got blueballed and the fleet is all spread out, shooting a newby and endup sending him to much isk cause you had a nice conversation, meeting total sperglords in local, being total sperglords in local and the random ppl from all over the world that you meet in your corp...sure eve can be boring and shitty as hell but in the end these moments keeps me coming back to the game. o7

inactive being time since last login i would imagine

You do realise nobody other than yourselves consider it a race.

nda

NDA says no.

The great thing about that is that y'all only have yourselves to blame. If you had let us get the data censored, we'd have nothing to discuss.

gf
---
Eh, it's self-demonstrative.

Awesome drawing, please draw some more shops of Eve.

TIL I didn't allow to censor some data
---
In English, "you" can refer to the third-person singular as well as the third-person plural. Often, a speaker will choose to use the somewhat unrefined "y'all" to indicate the third-person plural specifically, to reduce confusion.
---
Third-person plural can refer to a very large group of people, such as a whole of posters on a website.
---
This is my time. My high quality content has been waiting. Watching. Ready to strike...

Where is the Monthly PvP Report - January 2019 ?
---
50 bhaalgorns through an E545 coalition
---
Back in 2007 I ran a small gang PVP corporation with about 20 active members.  We flew kitchen sink fleets and traded up between harassing Providence when Hammer's Slammers owned the Kari end of it and harassing Geminate back when Roadkill/Smash/Fang and Atlas lived there.  Hundreds of great kills.  Dozens of good wars.  All lost to time now since the KB's that had that info are gone and zkill won't host non-verified KM's.
---
It was a great time for small gang.  Just roaming and killing ratters or running into other gangs and having good fights.
---
One day I get a chat request from a guy that I'd killed a few times and proceeds to tell me that he appreciates our play style, he's not mad, but he's got an enemy that he'd like taken care of.
---
I ask him who and he says his CEO is a raging asshole and has started treating everyone like shit.  He gives me a bunch of details and I agree this guy is a giant bag of dicks.  
---
The guy who contacted me is a director with full permissions and wants us to come raid their tower.  He'll take it offline and empty the the structures for us to loot, then we can take the tower and everything.  Basically clean his own corp out for a 4-5 billion.  This was, of course, before even small corps could shit out a Titan like now and a few hundred million was a financial hit for most.
---
So we form a little fleet.  Some of us in haulers (before jump bridges and jump freighters) some of us in pods to fly stolen ships back.  I had a huge hauler at the time, a fully loaded Occator!
---
So we show up and the dude is good to his word.  The shields are down, he's ejecting shit for us to loot and unanchoring everything.  So we spend a good hour or more cleaning out the place.  The tower finally comes offline, I scoop it up... and the CEO logs on.
---
He logs on and e-warps to the tower he logged off at, finds about 20 neutrals sitting there with all his shit in our cargo holds.  Not only that, but we lock onto him in his Armageddon, point him, kill him and pod him.
---
A few minutes later I get an angry message about how did I get in his forcefield... was I hacking?  So I tell him the whole story and he rage quits.  I put that guy in my friends list to chat with him again if he ever logged on... ten years went by and he never logged on again.
---
I made a guy quit eve permanently after raiding everything he had.  I'm not proud of it, but I'm not not proud of it either.  It's stuck with me ever since.
---
I'm about to drop episode 1 of my series specifically looking at solo frigate pvp (but in nullsec). Significantly different than lowsec, but could still be useful. I'll shoot you a link when the video goes up
---
The Astero is primarily used for hacking sites. The drone bay should just be filled with ecm drones. 
---
If you want to have the option to attack a ratter or another explorer, you’ll want the Stratios. zKillbord, search “Stratios” for fits. Ships lost in WSpace will be your best bet.
---
And just an extra tip; the sleeper sites aren’t worth the hassle. You’ll spend too much time dealing with the rats and by the time you get around to hacking, you’ll have been decloaked for so long that anyone who noticed you has had enough time to reship to specifically counter you.
---
Sansha, Serpentis, Angel relic sites are where the money is at. Skip the data sites unless you just want the practice.
---
CTH
---
You can build blops anywhere. Supers, not so much.
---
Amamake?
---
So who exactly didn't allow to censor some data and why is that relevant for me bitching about rorquals/capitals online?
---
Y'all.
---
If the data had been censored, no one would know that mining is so important, other than a few of us in GSF.
---
Aw... and Ithought it was just for me ;)
---
*commits sudoku*
---
the question really is are they going to fight FRAT and fam them selves or are they gonna get scared and call in their masters?
---
You mean the sketch at the top of Reddit as you posted this? 
---
You'll never fly a Titan, probably wont ever even see one on grid. You MIGHT fly a Super Carrier if you buy enough PLEX.. but the servers will go dark LONG before you earn it in-game. 
---
I can't think of a worse time to begin Eve Online than now. It's like asking a 98 year old in hospice for a date hoping she might marry you in the future. 
---
No, the stargates where not the last point on the roadmap. They where centered around new colonization and new space with completely new forms of gameplay.
---
What they delivered is a simple replacement for jump bridges, not stargates as anyone was ever envisioning them.
---
I can understand that visions change and that some people may expect more than what actually ends up in the game. But the difference here is so huge it SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT LEAST ADDRESSES.
---
Everyone would understand if they said "the scope was too big we had to make it more realistic to be able to deliver". Instead they just say nothing, even act like this is what they talked about and when it gets pointed out it's all " we can't talk about the vision"... WHY?
---
At the moment it just looks like there is ZERO future for this game. This was already the case over year ago when I tried to address this on the official forums and got just a flood of people agreeing with me, even people who completely hate my guts on every other topic.
---
CCP somehow did not hear the bullet. And it's soon to late as this is going downhill very very fast. Your job is to make them aware of this and to demand that they communicate their plans for jump the game. Stop defending them. Act like a community rep and not like a CCP spokesperson, they don't pay you for that.
---
probs not 
---
Eve missions are like that.  There is a limited pool of them and you’ll run the same ones repeatedly. 
---
You need 1.0 standing to run level 2 missions, 3.00 to run level 3 and 5.00 to run level 4. 
---
This is why so many people here PvE in Eve. The content will get extremely repetitive after a while. 
---
There is a weekly thread for exactly what you are looking for, if you are interested in reading about personal stories that happen in the game you should look it up.
---
You can, but you have to put in a ticket to do it though, you can’t do it through the account webpage anymore.  
---
The actual sketch itself is!
---
No - close though. Figured lowsec staging would be good, but I wasn't sure about being in the busy system for reshipping.
---
No offense but that had nothing to do with the questions. Titans aren’t even on my agenda.
---
And if right now is the worst time to start, things can only get better.
---
You'd think you'd thank me for sparing you from a cringey ACKSHUALLY argument.
---
Aryth moved to have the MER data censored or obfuscated in some way at a CSM summit a few years ago I believe. The majority of the other CSM reps disagreed with him
---
I remember finding hundreds of CNR botting accounts in HighSec, watched them for a while, got all the ship fit scans pieced together what their faction fit was (since they were usually to young to have T2), logged all their hull ID's and got my brother and some gank talos's ready to start whacking them while they were in heavier DPS missions.  We hit were able to hit ONE and got a nice payout.  Then a few days later CCP changed the NPC aggro mechanics and the instant our gank talos's landed on grid the heavy DPS was immediately switched to us.
---
Conclusion we came to, CCP actually likes the bots, because someone is buying PLEX, it doesn't matter much to them who or what, just so long as they get paid.
---
And he posted it on reddit hours ago befor you could steal his karma, but nice try.
---
Great i can live with that
---
Yeah, the time when they overpromis and underdeliver is over.
---
Now they underpromis AND underdeliver.
---
Pretty sure you can get a dread made in delve and have it fitted for less than 1.2bil
---
If not for rorquals goons would have never been a threat in EVE. If not for supercaps Snuffed Out would have never been a threat in Black Rise. If not for citadels WH groups would never have been a threat. If not for highsec no one would care about code. No one fucking cares dude. AT was a well liked community event. AT ships give value to participation and competition in AT.

No, it isn't, because Eve is a game of war. Quit your bitching.

Your problem is that you go code brown when a super lands on grid, that much is obvious.

I seriously actually wouldn't mind if Calidornia banned gambling lootbox games. I bet that would get some attention from the likes of EA, Activision, etc. just for starters. But warning labels are just stupid, no one actually pays attention to them. People still buy booze and cigs with or without warning on them.
---
On original topic:
---
1. Its just a bill not a law
---
2. It calls for a warning, not a sales ban.
---
"He's a little obsessed."
---
wow, did ccp take down the video?!
---
Remove PVP and allow rorquals in highsec. Add mining ⛏ doomsdays
---
Also none of those groups and downvoting because you have no clue what you are talking about -at all- 
---
Thank you!
---
ITT: OP tries to backpeddle
---
Those same bombers are a thread to capitals, however.
---
No, I mis-stated (a mistake). The point remains the same. There are small hulls that can punch well above their weight.
---
Ccp made it a pain in the ass.
---
You are indeed permitted a biased opinion and to insinuate and hope that it comes across as an insult. 50/50 chance you are wrong every time you presume, however.
---
Half the SR corps in SMA, tempting me to resub while still buried at work damn you QFC. My blops hunter sits in UVHO unsubbed :( 
---
This guy. "Where is the Monthly PvP Report - January 2019" LMFAO
---
Because they couldn't fix the first
---
Ouch
---
I mean... yes these things exist and yes, you should look them up at some point but really for tonight, whip out your Pyfa, throw together half a dozen fits to try, fly to the lowsec nearest your hub and just do it. The prep people put into getting into PVP really confuses me, like they want some respected pew type to grant them the title 'Solo PVPer' or a learner sign for their killboards. We just go out there, kill shit and die. Lots. And we're out there now, waiting to fight you ♥
---
I know you get a lot of heat on reddit for being "attention seeking," but I personally appreciate the general presence and at least the perceived effort of working on behalf of the players. Please continue updating us on your thoughts, especially since ccp has been so quiet. 
---
Missed opportunity for Impregnancy
---
Why do you want to pvp so much in a pve game? Just mine and krab in nearly perfect safety like everyone else. Then fight about who has the biggest ticks on discord.
---
What if.. and this is a big leap here... WHAT IF... the MER IS THE NEW ALLIANCE TOURNAMENT... and it happens each month!

It is the image called Total Destroyed by Region duh.

Once I was running and derelik lowsec looking for gas sites to huff (I was on a drug making kick) and I found a POS with the forcefields down and an orca just floating in space. Called to my corp and found someone who could fly an orca and then we escorted it like 10 jumps back home. Ended up trading the orca to our industrial director for his permission to use one of our poses to make said drugs.
---
Whatever you're smoking, i want.
---
SMA is shit. I do enjoy watching you guys tinfoil though.
---
Let's just say you're wrong and that i am uniquely qualified to know the actual reason.
---
Thanks mate! &lt;3

They should have made those arms and cockpit look different. The ship does need to have 2 "arms" or parts of its structure like that not because copy CCP or anything like that but because of the way salvaging works in their game. Basically the salvaged parts, debris, material, passes through some sort of a field to break up. This field is generated between those arms, or extrusions if you will. Their bigger salvaging ships do not need them as they have enough space for an actual chamber to do, but this one does cause of its size. 
---
Not defending it, but like I said, they should have at least made them look different.
---
On a side note, for some odd reason, when I look at an arm, just by itself, it reminds me of a can opener, the kind that you put on a can then rotate the knob to cut it. Could be just me though.
---
So what now for your corp? Any corp that does not have goals or some sort for progression just stagnates. If you don't find a motivation for your guys to log on they will just stop. From the sounds of it your next move would be to try to conquer someone. Take their space, or at least harass them. But with current mechanics that is pretty much pointless. The best thing you could do is cloaky camp them. And we all know how fun that is. So you are left with the option of just continue doing what you are doing and watch you guys get bored and stop logging on, or pointless bash your head against a larger more organized opponent who has every advantage in the current meta. 
---
I know all these thing from first hand experience, I have been a corp CEO and content creator since 2007.
---
Well, i didnt know that and posted here and on twitter as soon as I saw it on discord!

Makes things less easy. Adds an element of risk no matter how small. It's adds something.
---
Total cost isn't a relevant balancing factor in the new age of credit card warriors.
---
you won cause goons can put whoever they want in charge, also literally buying votes dont pretend you represent the eve community or that people want you to be CSM. God knows you didnt win due to your intelligence or charisma

The christmas presents required everyone to log into the game between 11. and 23. of december, which could explain the exceptionally rise during that month. For the "character isk"-metric only "active accounts" are being taken into account, and seeing the drop in jannuary, it is likely, that the definition of "active account" is something along the line of "has been logged into during the last 21-30 days".
---
I'll join and share some of my MS Paint Masterpieces :D 
---
Ha ha, sweet!

Yes, all cover ghost sites are dangerous and shouldn’t be attempted. I 100% agree.

My money is on SC coming out when eve dies.

I've never heard of someone proud to publicly admit moving from Minnesota to Wisconsin before. I've seen everything now.
---
You really have no idea what you’re talking about. 
---
They were until you goons decided to kick SR out of QFC. 
---
Look at you flex that you are 'uniquely qualified' to know the actual reason. The actual reason is easily findable in the QFC rules list. 
---
In the rules list it says: 'If one group of alliance becomes too dominant GSF reserves the right to request you dissolve your bonds and reset each other. ' Which we were.
---
Well you specifically mentioned that reducing citadels "is directly correlated with how much manpower you need to invest to clear everything out."
---
I'm not clear on how this would happen, or how it would help if it did. Can you expand a little?
---
I wish I still could draw, I’d love to see more of the Gallente ships or just the more unique ones at least. But sadly I broke my fingers and cant draw a straight line for shit.

&gt;&gt;&gt;High sec Carebear Adventure&lt;&lt;&lt;
---
I met a guy on Grindr, banged in the woods. Post-coital chit chat reveals he plays eve too :D
---
He was a CEO of a small newbie corp (about 40 ppl) and I was CEO of a lil indy corp full of my own alts. We decided to form a small alliance between the two corps.
---
Little did I know, he was taunting some high sec war deccers (obv before war dec changes), and they declared war in the alliance.
---
He promptly logs off for over 2 months, leaving his newbie corp at the mercy of more experienced pvp players.
---
At this point, I had a control tower up in a quiet system for research. It took about 4 days for it to be located.
---
Seige begins. Newbie corp start messaging me asking for help as their leadership is gone. So I decide to dust off my pvp ships that haven't seen action since my old WH days.
---
Fast forward a week. My corp has kills totalling over 4bn (mostly from a proteus that thought it could take my pilgrim). I lost nothing. War deccers surrender as killing newbies in iterons doesn't make enough profit when you're losing blinged out ships.
---
Note to war deccers - don't assume that just because someone chooses to live in high sec, doesn't mean they can't match you in pvp if they choose :) 
---
okay
---
Back when I first started playing eve, I knew I wanted to get into pvp as soon as I could, so after a few days getting used to the game and making some starting cash with exploration, I decided to do the 'go lose 30 cheap frigates in lowsec' introduction to pvp thing. A dozen or so shitfit atrons and condors later, I'd died every time without scoring more than cosmetic damage, but I was having fun and still determined to get a kill eventually.
---
Hopping a condor around the section of lowsec I'd been roaming I see an incursus on scan. I look up that ship on the uniwiki and see it's commonly fit with blasters, and I get a bit excited - my rockets should outrange that, maybe I can finally get a kill! I pin down his location to a particular plex with my newly-learned ability to narrow the angle of dscan, and warp in... only to see the incursus warping away as I land.
---
At the time I had no idea that plex farmers were a thing, so I was very confused - why on earth would he run away? Come back here and kill the helpless newbie, darnit! Well, if he's going to run away, I'm gonna follow him, *some*one's gonna blow up here sooner or later! I proceeded to chase him around the system for a good half-hour or more, getting plenty of practice using dscan to figure out where he went but never managing to catch him before he warped away. Eventually, however, he got tired of the game and went to a safespot to wait me out. I was able to pin down his location precisely with dscan, but of course had no way to warp to it.
---
After fuming over his cowardice for a few minutes the wheels started turning in my head. I know how probing works, and I've got an imicus in dodixie a half-dozen or so jumps from here. I haven't tried combat probing before, but how hard can it be? I eject from my condor at my own safespot, fly my pod to dodixie, rip almost everything else off my imicus to jam on an expanded probe launcher, and head back. He's gone back to plexing in my absence, but goes back to his safespot again as soon as I head to his plex in my condor. Perfect.
---
I swap back to my imicus in my safe and start probing. I already knew where his safe was from my earlier dscanning, so it only takes a couple cycles to get a 100% result. Waiting out the session timer as I swap back to my condor again I can only pray he doesn't move. Finally the longest session change timer ever ends, and I can board my combat frigate. Warp!
---
Dropping out of warp, I am surprised and elated to see he's still here, only a few kilometers away! My hands are shaking with the tension, but I manage to lock him up, set my orbit, activate my scram and web, and unleash my mighty 40 dps of scourge rockets. (In hindsight, holy crap rocket condors suck. &gt;.&gt;) I've got him tackled, he's not moving, my rockets are eating into his shields, and I haven't even taken any damage yet - maybe I can finally get a kill!
---
Wait, there's another ship here all of a sudden, where'd he come from? What's an Imperial Navy Sli- ***ZAP ZAP ZAP ZAP KABOOM!***
---
I am of course shaken at the sudden demise of my ship, but still manage to warp my pod away to my safe. Convoing the person who killed me, an amusing tale emerges. He'd been wandering around lowsec looking for trouble, had come into system as I was swapping ships in my safe, and on a whim had used his probing alt to scan down the incursus at basically the same time I had. His alt had arrived on grid first cloaked and had seen me arrive while his main was in warp, and he decided to go for me as the farmer ended up being in the same militia as his main and hence was blue. He had no idea I was a new player until afterward (in his words, "explains why I have never seen such a cheap condor lol"), and was just as amused as I was by the cosmic coincidence that saw both of us dropping out of warp in the same piece of trackless nothingness at nearly the same moment. He gives me enough isk to replace my condor several dozen times over and we part ways. I got into npsi fleets and lowsec gangs not long after that, so it ended up being quite a while before I actually got a solo frigate 1v1 kill, but when it came I mentally dedicated it to the bored vet in his slicer who helped give me such a hilarious introduction to pvp in eve.

**Pandemic Batphone**
---
I was a young player in Eve. I had just started FC'ing for Guardians of the Galaxy. We were living in Querious. This was before GOTG was completely PANFAM aligned. In fact, PL had been living in Delve and dropping on any capital that moved across the various regions. This included many people in my corporation. We were fighting a "war" with LUMPY in the north of Querious. I was still too young to understand the politics behind the war. With that backdrop in mind, this story begins with FC Haitekk from Blades of Grass taking a 90 man hurricane fleet to a PoS timer. I am backup FC.
---
We get there. On the PoS grid. A cyno goes up. A Lumpy titan jumps in. We realize....he jumped instead of bridging. Haitekk was concerned we could not handle it. Warped us off grid. We had two sabres in fleet. I yelled that we should try and mess with it. The sabres warped back in. We realized that PL had their campers around. All of our tackle (ceptors and t1 frigates) started burning across various systems looking for a camper. We found one that responded to convo. PL was brought in.
---
PL cyno'ed up. And, I helped secure my first Titan kill. This story comes off a bit stale over reading but it truly was such an exciting event for myself. I had only been in the game for a few months (at a serious capacity). 
---
Here is a link to the kill: [https://zkillboard.com/kill/49860622/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/49860622/)
---
The gila fleet came in after that. We (along with PL) proceeded to shoot the Gila's. The war continued. PL/PH eventually came in and evicted Querious. However, I will always remember the Titan that died in Querious due to the Pandemic Batphone. 
---
I've taken tons of art classes and you draw better than I do. You need to work on line quality but those antenna look sharp and line quality is a confidence thing when you are able to draw this good. 
---
That’s what I do. But when I think community sentiment is not reflecting a fair view of the issues, I’m going to say so. CCP is not always wrong and I’m not going to shit on them if I don’t think they deserve it. In the same vein, I much prefer to tell them directly what I think when I’m critical of what they are doing rather than shitpost on reddit and get shut out. 
---
Awesome, thanks for setting this up! \\o/
---
Seriously.  Everyone knows Am0k. can't tackle.  How embarrassing is it to be locked down by one.
---
I plan on it. Thanks for being willing to say this. Expect to get downvoted to oblivion. :)

Control of space is basically a matter of asserting player will over a piece of space. If you have more persistence and determination to stick around, and the ability to protect assets against attack, you can hold on and sustain yourself indefinitely, in theory. Most players don't really have that kind of dogged persistence. Citadels and Structures, as they are, place unrealistic demands for persistent attention to keep any one piece of space on sustained lockdown. It's one of the things that has led to diminished senses of attachment to the game, because it's not realistically possible to pick a piece of space and assert your will on it enough to definitively say "this belongs to me right now."
---
Wow you sound mad
---
There’s a lot of meh advice by poor people here.
---
Generally speaking you want a mwd, and one of each of the scanning upgrades in your mids.
---
When you’re done scanning the system,  after bookmarking all your connections and looking around there for actives. You then refit with the mobile depot you have in your outrageous cargohold to a cargo(or ship?) scanner, your hacking module of choice, and keep the acquisition speed (its the best).
---
Highs are sisters core and a cloaky, for lows I use a DCU, namo, Overdrive, and ancillary. (I also keep two scrams and two webs so My alt can tackle the drifter in it, in the cargo).
---
But this is for poors man. You’re chasing a hamster wheel.
---
I shouldn’t say much. I look endlessly in a 300mil strat for sites marked unsafe in the reference mr eve-scout dropped on the top comment. It’s good isk.
---
Get over yourself.
---
There is no race. There is just all turbokrabs moving into one region.

There is no sabotage. There is just whalers following where whales go.

Hahaha! Literally me!

CCP caring about its player base said no one ever.

Also stay there its a moldy, stinky state.  
---
I can dig it, but I think they were just reconfirming what top comment said since you kinda disagreed with that as well. EvE is cool because you can fashow go ahead and fit it how you want to, but going with a well know tested fit isn't wrong. 
---
SO much this. 10/10
---
Moorhead Checking in.
---
Didn't they just change the models?

That's great. I half expected a back stabbing, but making an asshole ceo rage quit is way better
---
The point of not giving you a fit and rather giving a means to sanity check your own fit ( realize your mistakes and hopeful swap out modules for those that unify better with the stated goal of the fit ), it teaches you to setup your own fittings ( and means you don't have to depend on other people to fit ships for you ), rather then gives you a solution to the current problem with something you can copy paste into game without really understanding it. 
---
There was one time, several years ago, where I was living in a wormhole with some buddies that I've known in EVE for a year or two. I had just recently gotten used to PVP despite having played for several years in HS, and grew to really, REALLY love jamming (keep in mind this all happened before the nerf allowing jammed folks to lock those jamming them).
---
We go on an armour roam: I forget what folks bring, but I was in an armour-tanked Falcon whose fit we worked out so I could take my favourite ship on the roam. 
---
We roll through a few wormholes, cross a few systems, and haven't run into anybody. We're starting to get a bit bored, when we find a hostile gang on the other side of a hole we jumped through. They outnumber us by somewhere between 3-6 folks, but we were itching for a fight and so we shrug and go for it. 
---
We start engaging, and, with me being relatively new to PvP and gang fights, I had no clue about target priority, so I start jamming whatever I could get a lock on first. It turns out that I jammed their logi, and a good portion of their DPS, and that my jams are landing cycle after cycle. I'm too focused on my jamming to see how the fight's actually going, but we manage to hold our own... until I get a cycle where every single jam I have fails to land. 
---
Things start taking a turn for the worst, and eventually we get wiped out, podded, and start making our way back home. It was the best small gang fight I have ever been on, and it turns out our FC had been talking with their FC and actually called out my Falcon as almost turning the tide of the whole battle, and that if the jams had held they would have started falling. Hearing that made my relatively-new-to-PvP-self beam with pride, and Falcons became my own personal "FC can I bring a Drake?" meme.
---
So jib doesn't notice it
---
You can maybe do combat exploration in C1 wormholes in a Stratios but you'll make a lot more isk if you just stick with kspace relic sites in low class wormholes in an astero or a covert ops. Years ago it was possible to cheese a certain C5 relic site in a Stratios but I would guess it has changed. 
---
As for fittings, I'd either go for max agility covert ops or for a combat fit astero that can fight other asteros which might be worth it if you're gonna do exploration in wormholes exclusively.
---
I was there the day test and goons turned, and left NC/MM to fall. Thus creating the "Imperium Coalition Please Ignore" to be born. 
---
once again.
---
Yeah but rather than going through the thousands of items testing them, somebody could direct me towards certain modules at least. Whenever I put on a fit and I read through the item’s descriptions and attributes, so I can understand why this fit is put up the way it is and to understand what’s the purpose of each item. Is that wrong as well?
---
I had to pull out. 
---
you down with O P P???
---
But lo-sec is still filled with NPC stations. Unless you're advocating that those be removed as well, or some means of alienating undesirables from them, then no amount of persistence will lead to being able to keeping that space.
---
Also we already *have* a very large zone of space specifically designed for people to be able to claim parts of it.
---
Muiripat
---
Yeah, what does CCP cares if people quit and start spending their money on other games. The feeling that the outrage isn't justified is enough to pay the bills. Right? Right? So keep telling them they are fine and keep telling us we are wrong, good job.
---
The Gon Please Ignore
---
Thanks a lot for that fit, I’ll give it a try when I get on. Also thanks for giving me the idea to look into some t3c to train towards :)
---
Careful. Being in Moorhead for too long could cause you to end up in Climax MN and Cummings  ND isnt far away at that point.

That's great. I bet someone was really confused when they came back and thier orca had disappeared.

Maybe thats the new MMO CCP is hiring for?
---
because i want to help others with the knowledge i have that ccp will never change and never improve the game
---
DHSJ is recruiting 
---
No, I would not. Thought that was obvious but then again you're a Goon so I can see how putting yourself in someone else's shoes is a tough thing.
---
&gt; how exactly js doing so contributing to the boredom?
---
Because doing this deters people from wanting to engage with you for content. For example, when wormhole corps with static null holes roll into Delve space, almost every single one will immediately roll the hole because they know that any amount of 'content' they seek will result in supers.
---
Like I previously said in my other post, there is nothing inherently wrong with stomping out content like that, but doing it then immediately saying that "boredom" is the primary motivator for fights is fucking laughable because that boredom is self-induced due to Goons / TAPI / Frat / etc etc history of dropping supers on t1 subcaps.

&gt; how the fuck have you been upvoted?

I have spent time in null.

&gt; have the people who upvoted you never played this game?

I'm not sure if this is rhetorical or you actually want me to answer this.
---
&gt; The ENTIRE POINT of this thread is that people simply won't engage unless they get to stomp someone
---
That is not true. Just because the majority of people play like this does not mean that 100% do. Plenty of people (maybe not major null blocs) will engage when the odds of winning are not in their favor because they actually know how to have fun even if the fight is not 110% in their favor. Crazy, I know.
---
You need to do some self-reflection bud and ask yourself 1) why you're so salty, and 2) is winning the only possible way for you to have fun in a **game**? If so, ask yourself why. It is a pretty unhealthy attitude and is a cancer among the majority of online gaming due to emotionally immature people like yourself.

---
I'm not advocating for anything of the sort. I don't know if you've tried to keep a given area clear of miscellaneous structures that other people put up and utilize for their own ends, but it is very tedious and time-consuming to do so - and it's boring and low impact to do so, because these structures are so easy to deploy in large quantities. NPC stations don't matter, because they don't belong to anybody. Structures do matter, because they belong to someone. Right now, it's hard to impose your will on other people because structures are hard to destroy. It doesn't mean that the game can't be fixed unless you can't physically remove someone's presence in a solar system in its entirety because NPC stations exist.

No whaler aims to "cripple Delve" in terms of nullifying the MER. That's impossible by game design. So congratulations on your achievement guaranteed by how Eve is designed. Please brag more about it each MER.
---
Our goals are more subtle. Delve is full with 0 skill 0 achievement utter moronic carebears farming in 0 velocity (like these!)[https://www.twitch.tv/videos/382628401], like it is hisec. You provide them hisec level protection using game breaking mechanics untouched by CCP. They provide you with +1s in your titan fleets and dank MER stats. Our job is done when these people feel a little bit of risk in their necks. To quantify it, you can ask your Rorqual pilots whether they can afk mine as they used to.
---
Whenever a Goon cites MER to show how people like me and Mar5hy did not reach our goals, or whenever a Rorqual pilot says "already replaced" when I steal 5 drones (as if that's not a good thing that keeps me stealing), a kitten dies somewhere and logic dies with it too.
---
Hmmm.  Looks more like a cloaky tengu to me. 
---
Eh, just krabbing
---
haters will say they are cloaked
---
Major war? One can only hope...
---
Goon won by large but we already know all know that. The same from 1 year ago and peraps more :D
---
Welcome to the goon plan.
---
At the core, its simple:
---
Don't give money or assets to non goons.
---
So you sell to goons. And manufacture for goons. And buy from goons.
---
Any time money or assets go to a non goon, that's a failure they try to eliminate.
---
Its not the easiest of tasks, and it's not one anyone else has tried.
---
Could start in the NPC FW corp then can check out all the active corps in the FW your interested in.

Pandemic Batphone is a great title. Operator errors are what makes EVE so interesting.

They're clearly hiding something!

Small world syndrome never ceases to amaze

Well done.

KRABS
---
You sure? It should be set to infinite. Here's a fresh one if you're still having trouble: [https://discord.gg/YazYSwj](https://discord.gg/YazYSwj)
---
Except it was passed and signed into law, making it... a law.
---
Easier than you'd think once the delve market got so large.
---
Bring 3 sets of probes. You will eventually lose a set. It is no fun being in a wormhole with no probes.
---
when was it passed and signed into law?
---
Are weebs aloud?
---
Bold move, posting this during Shark week. Upvoted anyways.
---
Oh shit I didn’t think of that, usually I have 2 sets tho but I never thought about losing them... I guess you know from experience tho, from the way you put it hahahaha 
---
I see what you did there :-)
---
You win
---
Gee, what crusade will you go on next? Reminding people that gravity exists so don't use ladders?
---
Shame Cache didn't make it into the MER so it could win the "smallest amount of ISK destroyed" award
---
The CFC
---
Not long after starting, I fell in with some street toughs based out of lowsec Everyshore (Mannar).
---
We had no care in the world.  We took contracts to bash POSes.  We camped all day and night.  Losses were nothing.  Victories were everything.  We lived life like we were always in structure.  We smartbombed gates.  We made life hell for highsec miners by crashing a fleet of rifters into them every other day.
---
I remember one particular event was right after the 3rd tier of Battleships hit the market.  And what would find its way into Mormelot within the first week of production?  A fresh Abaddon, still with that holy land new ship smell.
---
The seas were calm that day, but this poor fool didn't realize that the seas of Everyshore bowed to our will.  We surrounded him, ten of us at least, with a quick lockdown.  He immediately realized his folly: the sea had turned against him.  He began screaming out to any who would listen.  But there were none who would come that day.  He was alone in our waters.
---
And yet...we had an idea.
---
Why destroy such a pristine ship?  Why not carry away a nice, new trophy instead of our usual plunder of leftover trinkets?
---
"Eject, and I won't kill you."
---
"You mean it?"
---
"Of course..."
---
And that's how we got our hands on a free, 'donated' Abaddon.  At a time when 100 million or more for a ship was considered too bourgeois for our kind, it was like taking a spin in a Gallente billionaire's custom hovercar down the ghetto slums of some Caldari worker housing district, wind in your face...
---
Oh, and the pod?  Let's just say the one he made a bargain with wasn't speaking for all of us.  His remains washed up along the rocky banks of Everyshore, a warning that the free captains of Mannar would gladly take your possessions as charity, or burn them to ash if you refused.
---
I haven't posted during shark week yet, I'll get my shitiest super dupa pooper shitpost cooked up
---
It is easy as fuck.
---
Goons literally just said ' we love krabs, come to goon space and krab with us'
---
While every other entity in eve was trying to push the "fuck krabs, we are elite pvpers" mentality.
---
Ignore the edgelords on this subject mate and keep that positive attitude. o7
---
This the real game right here, nothing gets me off more than watching numbers go up
---
May sounds good.
---
I shouldn't be laughing, but that's the mentality you need to play this game sometimes!
---
It requires a change in mentality for them. Not the easiest of tasks.
---
*cries in Hard Knocks*
---
Server disconnects will do it. Also I think jumping into another wh with the probes out.
---
I have lost numerous sets but never had to pod myself or ask signal cartel for a rescue.
---
Actually after someone told me to carry more than one set, the very next trip I lost my first set to a dc.
---
Procurer vs Plagioclase

For the most part, making null ratting payouts tied to actual loot and not bounties just means that they'll set up buyback services and 90% of all that loot will just go through the already fairly protected logistics services, which will get MUCH richer if they're essentially getting 5% of the income the ratters are making
---
I love what you did with the Tech II cloaking device!
---
It was literally never a relevant balancing factor except in terms of how many current accounts are capable of physically using one, given character selling still existed
---
Unironicaly this
---
Thanks, that was a really difficult piece! I do not begrudge the ccp art department!
---
Thanks for taking the time to write that post, I appreciate the information/advices :)
---
Normally I hate your posts but this made me laugh. 
---
I bow before the level or artistry on display, here. I’ve talked to a couple of the CCP graphics wizards, and they are breathtakingly good at what they do. I don’t think any one of them has ever eclipsed what you did here.
---
A genuine tip of the hat to you, good sir.
---
ladders are made to be as safe as possible and proper operation of a ladder makes using a ladder even more safe
---
ccp are going to fuck the game up no matter what you do
---
&gt;or whenever a Rorqual pilot says "already replaced" when I steal 5 drones
---
But this is the literal truth. They are already replaced. 
---
If the truth makes logic die, then perhaps the source of the "logic" is what is in question (this would be you).
---
We are the little ships around round the roqual. To save it we need to change your mental attitude/ships and save the roqual/CCP. CCP tried some unpopular decision to gain some breathing room, because they are exhaused (thats why the event was so shit tier imo), and when they wanted to think, then they thought what they wanna do (launch of ccplease) and in the meantime some players where busy shitposting instead of giving feedback
---
r/evenewbies
---
That total production value is sexy af.
---
Not trying to shitpost, but didmt someone say that that game is to safe, i think its beacuse of players who dont wanna die, if you're advanced player than whelping a t1 destroyer, and now try to think of your first loss in eve ;) 
---
I went to the Dells and it was great!  Probobly because I didnt ride in a Death Trap.... I mean Duck Boat.

Alright, alright, I’ll learn how to fly the motherfuckers!

---
You kinda missed the important part of what I said. I don't deny that IF you are craving subcap good fights, then using supers on subcap roams until they stop coming around then saying you're bored would be asinine.
---
But not everyone wants subcap good fights. Some people just want to crush some puny roamers with the super cap they don't get to use for anything else. Those folks aren't being hypocrites by using the ship they want to fly and saying they're bored because they don't get to use it more often.
---
BL mining ......what they have become ......
---
Christmas has come early
---
What skin is that?
---
A war lmao who is it you imagine is left who can fight that...maybe if they merge the chinese server to that mega blob can fight this mega blob otherwise it's just a mop up operation at this point.
---
mod bias
---
Make geography matter! One per planet would be enough in most systems.
---
Maybe allow refineries on any moon so you don't hamper indy but tbh I wouldn't care if they did.
---
Generally speaking you wanna use EM vs shield ships and explosive vs armor ships in t1 frigs. T2 it mixes around a little more depending on race.
---
general reposti
---
Try to setup goals for what you wanna do, for example i wanna whelp this cruiser so i need money for it - &gt;i will mine and do other activities i like - &gt; i will have enough money to do qhat i wanted.
---
Did a bad job explaining? Maybe ask players which you meet, or just send me mail and just ask for help, i will be more than happy to try ;) my ign is Imiriath Da'Vienne
---
He's saying that the fact that they're already replaced means there's another set to steal
---
if youre the only one in the race does it mean everybody is a winner?
---
haha guys get it stealth bombers have cloak modules fit!!!
---
gold 4 u sir :) 
---
Pretty sure this isn't legit. Not allowed to have isk making characters in BL. Against the rules of being elite peeveepeers.

Good troll 10/10 ;))))

100% shit post. We are a lot in the imperium that like test as the same as panfam
---
&gt;botting is a huge problem
---
Quoting for posterity. 
---
Ok but why add the Stratios to it?
---
CCP publishes this and has for a while now. I'm wondering if they ever look at it and get any real information from it that they use in relation to the game.
---
One of my favorite moments was a few months ago. I was hunting for a corp blops gang with my trusty tengu in Russian space and after not much success I stumbled upon a carrier on dscan. I'd realized it was at a POS but still investigated because I was bored and not catching much. As expected I find it at a POS but wtf it's slightly outside the POS shield sitting on the edge empty? The POS was fully gunned/covered in scrams/points/webs. Naturally, the game was on. We bridged in our fuel truck to eject and attempt to board and jump out before getting caught by the POS. This was a failure and the carrier lacked fuel or even a real fit (mostly travel fit with a Concord booster so meh). The carrier was tackled and dying slowly. I'm not as familiar with POS mechanics as I could be but I decided that it was time for the long shot and yolod my tengu into POS range to pray that everything switched to me so we could warp the carrier out. Initially it did nothing but once I started shooting it everything switched to me for a split second and the carrier made it out in 5% shield. My tengu then spends the next 5 minutes slow boating scrammed and webbed away from a POS surviving in low armor out of cap and asb charges, good bless blue pill and heat. The blops fueltruck had to leave so I ejected my tengu and got his fuel truck and my tengu inside the carrier and sat cloaked until we managed to get a second fuel truck in to get me through a few jumps. Drove it like we stole it across a region back to blue space and sent the previous owner a note of thanks. Grand theft niddy in enemy Russian space was a blast. Probably the only ship I'll never sell. I'm with a different group in a wormhole now but I still have that niddy sitting in the south as a trophy.
---
star citizen did it better!!!!
---
implants check out
---
So you bought the guide?
---
/u/jibrish "shark week" lmbo
---
&gt;it cannot tackle any destroyers
---
It can't fit local tackle? It can't launch sirens?
---
Also balancing by cost is dumb. Always has been, always will be.
---
They need a bombing target!
---
flaaaaaaair baaaaaait
---
Oh come on! It only has a little bit of green on it, just eat around it, you'll be fine...
---
Remove sirens and dromis... done?
---
You did really well with the Imperial Jubilee colors. Showed why you pay the big bucks for that skin set.
---
We do have good cheese, and definitely know how to have a good laugh :)
---
So much for Jibrish burning this sub of garbage eh
---
I believe training time is irrelevant now days with injectors.
---
The last time a titan died in Delve was [*mid 2017*](https://zkillboard.com/region/10000060/reset/group/30/losses/) despite hundreds of them being dropped every day in the region...
---
Please don't open your mouth if the only thing that will flow out is your ceaseless retardation.
---
The new camo skins on the bombers are amazing as well!
---
Masterful.
---
whoah there hitler
---
&gt; get Guristas loot, including a potential Gila bpc 
---
If that's true than they must have changed their loot table. I've only seen them drop covert research tools (don't remember the exact name, about 15-50mil worth per drop), low grade implants that don't sell and faction structure rig bpc's that don't sell either. In terms of income they are (used to be, in case they indeed changed the loot table) much worse than even highsec anomaly ratting (if you find a quiet highsec that is).
---
Carrier can do it quickly but you're risking your fighters or your ship: Warp in too far away and they will target your fighters which will go down fairly quick, expect to lose a good chunk if you're getting unlucky. Warping in close will prevent them from going for your fighters but you'd have to make sure you're not getting spotted by anything for at least 2-5 minutes, otherwise you'll sit there pointed by these things.
---
Sentry Ishtar/Tengu are good bets, but because the you can get unlucky on the spawns the tengu might get vollied through it's shields and die.
---
🤔 theres no way this is snapchat.

Like how anchoring a keepstar is guaranteed to be safe if you protect it with a supercap umbrella? Nothing's guaranteed in Eve, Chauncey. The clever find a way. Well, that, and being willing to put some skin in the game.

Strange, it still says it's invalid/ expired, I'm on mobile though so that might have soemthing to do with it, I'll give it a try on desktop later

Kino is a hotbed of rebel mining activity. Something about it attracts closeted highsec dwellers who believe they are above the rules because their mains are supposedly in null. But a nullseccer mining in highsec is a veritable monument of failure.

Eve Online's primary game mechanic is how elite you are with your epeen of SP, its why pubbies still post in the recruitment channel with shit like "100mil SP char looking for pvp alliance convo me"

when have we literally ever claimed to be elite pvpers?

fffffffuuuuuuuuuuccccccccccccccckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk

Oh is it like y wing style then? That's actually a little cool.

Can you guys just let me talk shit without facts coming into this? Sheesh!

I mean, you got me. I still want to talk smack because everything else on reddit is EVE IS DEAD!

im sorry your self esteem was based on how many skills you had to V
---
My favorite part of fucking with Goons is watching you jump out to make sure we know how little you care every time
---
It's almost like we do it because it's fun, and not because we're waiting for Delve to collapse 
---
last time I checked they dropped low-grades and those don't sell, at least not for the price you're expecting, same for the rig bpc's
---
oh yea well i'm fucking gay, ill fucking wrap my lips around your cock and swallow every last fucking drop. How bout that?

Damn, I thought you were drawing some Alliance Tournament fanart. Guess I didn't look hard enough.

"Because i endured the misery that was being behind everyone else so should everyone else after me" is shitty logic and even shittier elitist asshole talk.
---
Any other MMO a new player can grind and catch up to the high SP/XP bittervets with enough sacrifice of time, but Eve is unique in that a new player is **permanently** left behind and punished explicitly because they didnt start playing before the bittervets did. Sure, the new player can have heaps of fun in less expensive/high SP ships, but when most fleets going out require T2 cruiser/T2 weapons/T2 whatever skills then it sucks ass and doesnt make for a fun game to log in to since you can't participate in everything.
---
No. that was an aside to the point, thus the parenthetical. Remove the parenthetical and you have the original statement, without the aside.
---
Bro, do you even grammar?
---
If you have been banned by a server prior, it'll show as invalid/expired as well. Not saying you are, but it is a possibility :)
---
&gt; The clever find a way. 
---
Pretty much the only people doing anything in Delve are "the clever" because anything other than wildly asymmetric tactics just gets met with dozens of autists happy to take a 5 minute break from chain running rock havens to drop their supers and titans on a roaming cruiser gang. I'm not sure what your point is, other than that you seem to have some misguided sense of the game where Delve (and other space held by one of the mega alliances) is anything other than protected by design. 
---
I am a simple man. I fly to Jita, sell to buy orders and buy to sell orders.
---
We know it isn't about delve collapsing. 
---
It's almost as if we jump out because it's fun, and not because anyone believes you.
---
&gt; The changes they have made to EVE in the last few years have been to entice people to not quit and to make EVE more approachable to casual players. 
---
The irony is that those changes are exactly the reason why people are quiting. 
---
Jita is a cultural hub
---
&gt; We know it isn't about delve collapsing.
---
&gt; literally the opposite of the point /u/AXSAmazingJay was making
---
sync up with your leaders young bee, you're off message

yup. CCP invented naming ships after birds
---
I mean to be honest, I really hope SC comes out awesome, Im just not handing them a dime until it is done and someone I trust says its good.

I’m over 1k deep and even at its current state, it can be a blot of fun just exploring and flying around. With this year however more and more features are being added and once s42 drops, star citizen itself gets thrown into high gear
---
Is this a serious question?
---
Why would I put my stuff in a player owned structure that someone can lock me out of or be blown up when I can put it in Jita and know it'll be safe until the servers shut down?
---
On the trading front, someones who's trading hundreds of billions in modules/ships/etc can't be arsed hauling it all around repeatedly.

Given your flair I'm sure you'll give some spiel about it being the safest trade hub in the game defended by the largest coalition, but that crown has been held for 4 different owners in the last 2 years.

Si vis pacem, para bellum.
---
Pretty much everybody in Eve wants to kill them, so yeah, I'm sure they are preparing for a major war. Against literally everyone else. Again.

It's the only smart play for their situation. If they don't then they'll just get steamrolled.

The fact that they constantly have to bring fleets to highsec to defend the thing kinda proves that wrong.

He isn’t even unwelcome there after that, I met him at ccp hq last august during a thing they invited icelandic players to, funny guy

yes
---
I appreciate all your work, and suitonias work a great deal. You both definitely make me feel like players voices are being listened to and contemplated at bare minimum by CSM members/CCP.
---
Also that.
---
My point is that if you're simply accepting the game as unwinnable, and never trying, then of course nothing is going to happen. The InitiativeDOT sniping a keepstar out from under NcDOT is proof that if you are clever, you can pull off some amazing stuff.
---
Put those big, untainted-by-spod brains to work for once and apply yourselves. Aren't all of you droning on and on about how much smarter you are because you turn your nose at mining? Well then, fuckin' prove it.

Like the ways content is found: 
---
1. Batphones, well this is the most lazy way to get content it's when somebody else go's hey fuckers come help me. 
---
2. Rolling into somebody, so if you roll a connection to a other group that is pvp centered you generally will fight them, keep in mind these fights are generally voluntary in the sense that both groups opt in to the fight, because most pvp groups like to fight. 
---
3.  Escalation from pve, this does happen often after a rolling in, common sources are Dreads in siege, Rorqs, or even getting a scram off on a nestor fleet, generally the friendlies will try and save it. 
---
4. All they way's i'm now forgetting to mention.
---
There are sources like evictions etc but honestly there not really day to day content. 
---
they are a threat if you outnumber them 80+ : 1. 80 ibis I bet could kill a cruiser before the cruiser could kill the rest of the ibis's.

I am actively writing a diary about our corp history and life. So if we are successful at becoming relevant in the Eve landscape, I will post it. I hope, that people get inspired one day by that diary to start their own journey and adventure instead of using all the preexisting stuff.
---
Why do you think we define winning by killing keepstars in Delve? What if winning to some people is killing ratters out from under the biggest super umbrella in the game? Or what if you think it's not possible to "win" a game like eve, and that the era of structure kills and sov changes being the goal is over? What then?
---
I could understand your point if what /u/Olmeca_Gold was saying was that he was quitting and joining Goons because you're invincible, so he might as well close up shop. But instead he's getting super kills and rorqual kills right under the nose of the biggest supercap umbrella in the game. If that's winning to him, then what else is there? You can't argue it's not an achievement - killing a super in Delve isn't exactly easy. Sure, it's not gonna bring Delve to its knees - but that was never the point, and most Goons don't seem to grasp that. 
---
For all the cleverness most Goons seem to think they have, they always seem to fail at the most basic thing. *Your* game is not *our* game. We're not playing your game. We don't want your sov. We don't want Delve to collapse, or your miners to go somewhere else. We're not after your renters. We don't want your structures to burn. At least not in the direct way that you're thinking. If Delve collapsed tomorrow, would I be happy? Yeah, I would think it's hilarious. But I also know that the bears in Delve would just go somewhere else, and all we would do is create a new Delve somewhere else. That's Olmeca's point. The game is structured now that _every_ region will trend toward Delve over time. That's the way it is now, and it's that way by design. We're not fighting that, because it's stupid to try. All we want to do is get kills, farm salt, and not have to deal with the bullshit mechanics like entosis and structure timer grinding that have made the goals you are still pretending that we are trying to reach unattainable and undesirable. 
---
Was going thru my archives and found a private video I posted sometime ago.
---
Ofc, issuing the same command to 4 clients is entirely possible so we should presume he is a high skill high apm Rorqual pilot.
---
Imagine being a multiboxer without knowing how fast you can change client and press a single button on each.
---
that jump gates of other groups are visible
---
Was going thru my archive and realized a video I posted sometime ago of this multiboxer.
---
Ofc issuing the same command to 4 ships same tick is entirely possible without broadcasting, so we should all assume this is a high APM high skill guy.
---
&gt; I can see pilot service items like Plex are almost exclusively trading from citadels, but not much else seems to be. 
---
Possibly because you can basically haul any amount of PLEX around perfectly safely in your PLEX vault, so the logistics of moving them if/when the current low-tax citadel gets blown up isn't that taxing. 
---
Moving large quantities of modules/ships/etc... even just between two citadels in the same system would be a massive undertaking. Moving them from Jita 4-4 into Perimeter would be a massive feat. Especially with everybody and their grandmothers trying to gank you on that gate.
---
Imagine being a multiboxer and not being able to tab through few windows while pressing a single button on each.
---
i thought u made a list of skill u victories
---
&gt;Why do you think we define winning by killing keepstars in Delve?
---
i don't, learn what an example is
---
in fact, none of this screed has anything to do with my point -- you and others are whining about how unfair the game is, rather than trying to find the weaknesses of the design (both ours and the game's) and using them to do things
---
the whole reason i mentioned initdot's keepstar kill in the first place is because it was executed skillfully and in a manner thought to be impossible and used it as an example of how simply accepting what everyone else thinks is true is the surest path to irrelevance
---
"Already replaced" is the truth. But it is uttered when the pilot wants to argue that I accomplished nothing by stealing 5 billions. Because he quantifies my accomplishment with my damage to him. Whereas I am here making dank is, and his replacements are actually a good thing for me. Thus one of the implicit premises of his argument is false, and logic dies.
---
1. Too much risk to lose your stuff, especially on longterm buy / sell orders. If I were just doing day to day and small amounts it might have been different.
---
2. The gains from tax breaks do not outweigh loss of sale orders.
---
3. They are untrustworthy. All of them. Even the ones that try legitimately will fall sooner or later, therefore still can't be trusted.
---
4. None of them are worthy of my business on principle. I would much rather 100x give whatever I can to NPCs then some shitty nullsec botting Rorq mining alliance. Granted that I still have no choice and have to buy stuff from them such as hulls, modules, ammo, etc. in Jita, but that doesn't mean that I have to give them everything and strongly prefer to give it to NPCs instead.
---
Always appreciate these reports.
---
I think the Winter summit for the CSM started today, the 18th?
---
LIMP.
---
Yet based on the timers on the wetu's, he launched those one at a time switching accounts.
---
Have same problem, it's annoying when you have to got a quick view on map.
---
It's a pretty simple concept. You have to haul the loot, not everyone uses a JF. A lot of people would load it on a yacht or a ceptor and potentially get killed, but more importantly, people who die with the loot in their cargo would lose it, and gankers would get it, so botters wouldn't get the loot when their ships get hunted like they currently do now. [https://zkillboard.com/item/30747/](https://zkillboard.com/item/30747/)
---
Actually, more people would mine but ore / min prices are so low for the effort and ochre drama + way to many other rorqs puts alot of people off. 
---
That said theres alot of people who start mining then give it up sell there rorqs, after a few months, and do some thing else after they make a thing or 2 to check off something on there eve bucket list.
---
Super prices on contract are dropping to 10-13 bill rigged and semi fitted in some cases.
---
Test is sort of heading in this direction some what as well.
---
in short mining could easily double or triple for delve if people thought they could get there isk reward for the effort required and something like a major war started that required bunch of mins to replace things.
---
Yeah it's almost like broadcasting keyboard commands (scoop command) and mouse commands (right click, launch) are two different functions in ISboxer.
---
The cheater was able to type the same in how many locals in the same tick?        
---
Please remind me how high his APM is?         
---
Can we not get Pearl Abyss to spend $425million to sue the shite out of the Star Citizen cult for this shameless infringement of IP?
---
He gained no unfair advantage by broadcasting a chat sentence. These Rorquals did. CCP rules are based on unfair advantage. Rules are rules right?
---
Welcome to days ago and calling me an elitist is actually hilarious. If you cant stand one t2 train then dont play. Simple as that. 
---
Just to clarify, im not talking about moving items. I was wondering why the market hadn't migrated to the new keepstar in Perimeter i.e. such that you wouldn't need to haul to Jita, you would just sell from the Keepstar itself.
---
If you sit on a dread with a bhaal the dread can't see you if you don't move :tapshead:
---
I like to sell things where the buy orders are at, so I sell bunch of shit then want to get ships etc at reasonable prices, 4-4 still beats every other hs hub.
---
unfathomable
---
Did you know that Hek is the better staging system for solo players?  It's only 2 jumps from low fw aera. 
---
Hek &gt; Hror &gt; Resbroko
---
Resbroko gate is sometimes camped, but you can do Hror &gt; Amo &gt; Res or enter Res via Auner gate. Fastest and safest way to enter the fight!
---
It’s not the vulture. It’s one of the utility crafts with a tractor beam extension. 
---
This is the pulse of Eve. Thanks again!
---
Cool story, but would be better if you were carrying 100b in blueprints.
---
For the same reason it didn't move to the last 3 major hubs in perimeter. It's not safe. Jita 4-4 cannot be destroyed, and can't lock you out. You never have to worry about your stuff being stuck in asset safety, and you don't have to worry about getting locked out of the structure.
---
Is a Rokh good enough to run level 3 security missions?
---
i never said i wasnt
---
Sadly, Jita beats all other trade hubs put together.
---
I saw all of them for a second once
---
&gt; Pretty much the only people doing anything in Delve are "the clever" because anything other than wildly asymmetric tactics just gets met with dozens of autists
---
the clever part was forging the power of raw autism into the ultimate weapon
---
Because I can’t dock in your keepstar, and using a neutral alt is too much effort 
---
wat he said
---
As long as it's fit properly. A well fit cruiser will outperform a badly fit battleship any day of the week. 
---
It's probably overkill though. You might actually make less isk in a cruiser since it's a slower ship. 
---
LOOOOOOOOOOL get it cause they CLOAK rOFL DUDE
---
that was only 3 rorquals on the same tick stop jebaiting me, also its really not that hard to hit shift + r while going through clients
---
Because a citadel will get killed eventually. The keepstar will probably survive longer than most other citadels that have been used thus far, but it's inevitable that it'll fall. And when that happens everything seeded on that market will need to be moved to whatever citadel replaces it. Which will involve a fuckton of hauling.  - Ain't nobody got time for that!
---
There's also a political factor. Even at a massively lower tax rate, the taxes collected from the keepstar go to TEST. You can understand why groups like PanFam and others would not want to contribute to TEST's income.
---
Some Venezuelan-style economic growth in here.
---
Best news source ever. 
---
Do you like pretend to be blind just to bait people into retarded arguments because you're a huge sperg and no one likes talking to you that much?
---
I've always known Olmeca is slow, but I never thought he's "8 keystrokes per second is high apm" slow
---
Epic, good luck with your endeavors. I'm actually using EVE as a basis for a light novel. Mostly because I play too many video games and I'm a shut in weeb who dislikes almost all the video game representations in manga/novel/anime/theatrical forms. I figured that an actual gamer should write for other gamers. SAO type stuff ain't got shit on me lol
---
I hope anyway.... the whole 'die in the game die in real life' shit has been done to death. I'd rather read about player driven goals and achievements rather than 'you're the chosen one, go level up and kill the demon king' again. It seems to me that it's more interesting having people with a complete lack of fear of death, beyond losing you're equipment.
---
imagine being so arrogant you cant accept there are people better at multiboxing than you so you have to post on reddit accusing them of botting.
---
Dude Mar5hy can shitpost 6 Reddit threads AND get a year ban in one tick, this is hardly impressive.
---
Btw how is your Loki?
---
:thonkerguns:
---
Unless you're using a ship that's bonused for a specific Rocket damage then the following generally holds:
---
Amarr - Explo
---
Caldari - EM
---
Gallente - Explo
---
Minmatar - EM
---
While any ship can fit a contrary tank, the most likely to do so are Minmatar. 
---
&gt;So you're in a catch 22 - say nothing and people assume you've got no plans and you're working on nothing. Give them more information, and you're locked in because folks will go nuts if it changes. Plus, the more information you give, the more time you end up spending in communicating, because it's rarely enough to just do a Dev blog. Even then, there are folks dissecting everything that's written and reading into it a dozen different things. I mean, I have seen zero evidence that Pearl Abyss has taken a direct hand in anything in EVE, especially design decisions, but that doesn't stop people from constantly saying it's happening all the time. It's hard to say sometimes which is worse - no information or partial information that gets misinterpreted and assumptions formed which you have to go back and try to fix. 
---
I realise that this fear of failing to deliver on promises is a huge barrier to transparency, especially in a game like EVE where things might just turn out to not be feasible, because of technical limitations of "legacy code" or scalability issues.
---
In those situations, I would prefer the devs to come out and say "we tried this, it didn't work, here is why. btw, we also made a more detailed post-mortem for you nerds who are into that kind of stuff." 
---
Yeah, some people will be disappointed and upset (as we've seen recently with the AT announcement), but it will pass. It's better than what we had in the past - radio silence, which only leads to years of resentment and a community feeling that it's being ignored, or worse, lied to. For CCP, a (relatively) small studio with one successful game, this community is all they've got. They clearly care about it, or we wouldn't have the CSM.
---
&gt; I've played a ton of MMOs, and there have been almost no games that provide average players with as many opportunities to interact with Devs than EVE. Hell, this EVE World Tour puts a regional fanfest within travel distance of pretty much everybody this year - go there, grab a dev, talk to them. These are the most approachable game developers I've ever seen, and I've served on another player council besides this one. 
---
We're talking about giving the average player a real say on the future of the game. There are games that do a much better job of this. OSRS comes to mind, even though it's a bit of a meme. We don't need a direct line to the devs, or for every StainGuy-esque shitpost to get an official CCP response to improve on this. Give us a poll in the client, let us tell you what we want to see next. Present a design draft, let us tell you if it's good or bad. Like I said - ideas, not people.
---
&gt;I agree that it sucks when your area of the game isn't getting attention. But, as you noted, the Devs are trying to do things that can appeal to everybody and not favor one area of space over another. FW absolutely needs its own redesign since citadels, and I've pushed for that and will keep pushing for that. 
---

Shut up
---
You sure you didn't just get bumped?
---
Wait did you literally just make a narrative shift from “*HE DIDNT INPUT BROADCAST*” to “*its totally ok to input broadcast if it’s just the chat client*”
---
No. If you pay close attention those 5 drones in the second tick belong to different Rorquals. It means they got in the next tick because they were a little far from their Rorquals.
---
as an autist who multiboxes supers, I will say ez Clap.
---
But why I just said it's a high APM Rorqual :(
---
Grab yourself a ferox instead of the rokh and they'll fly by large guns will have trouble with frigs and cruisers if your skills are not too good a bs is overkill for level 3s a battlecruiser/navy issue cruiser should breeze through them

that shouldnt remove the invulnerability, should it? if it does that's really stupid, my screen barely even faded in from black when i died and im playing on a very good computer and internet connection

&gt; None of these things are relevant for lowsec at all. Doing abyssal sites in low is the most retarded thing ever since you’re essentially doing something in a place where everyone is hunting you and the sites are equivalent in highsec. Agency are also useless in low. Citadels was another nail in the FW coffin.
---
&gt; 
---
that's precisely the issue with the current development process
---
This isn't clear from your post, but are you using an armor repair module?
---
Gallente ships like the Catalyst generally are armor-tanked.  (There's a few niche reasons to shield-tank, but don't worry about them yet...and you wouldn't do that with a Catalyst anyway).  A small armor repair module would mean you trade some capacitor for repairing your armor while you are in the mission.
---
Don't run it if your armor is not damaged (it uses *a lot* of capacitor), and you'll need to remember it fixes some of your armor at the *end* of its cycle so you can't wait until you're almost dead to start using it.
---
Also, put on an "Energized Adaptive Nano Membrane" module.  It increases your armor's resistance to damage while consuming no capacitor.  There are modules like this that are dedicated to a particular damage type, and you could use two of those if you want to instead of the EANM because you will end up with a higher resistance.  But you'll need to use both the thermal one and the kinetic one against Serpentis, so you use up two low slots instead of one for the EANM.
---
Seems like injectors are the bottleneck. Aside from lack of content for 90% of super fleets.
---
Wow, that looks exactly like replicator 0076

I think a good approach might be CCP coming up with the ideas and us telling them which ones we want to see more than others. Also which ones are just terrible and belong in the back of a dumpster truck in South Korea.

Tractor beam ship(jpeg) from Star citizen named Argo SRV :v

Yes!

I'm not gonna play "where did querns move the goalposts to this time" with you. What mar5hy, olmeca, and Leonia are doing is exactly what you're describing. You'll never admit it because you're too busy furiously masturbating to your own inflated self image, but that's what it is.
---
As the other poster said, it's commonly recommended for people to join one of the giant, new-player-friendly corps (Brand Newbros, Brave Newbies, Karmafleet or Pandemic Horde).  They have the infrastructure in place to help you learn the game, and someone in the corp is doing everything the game offers, so you'll be able to find people to help you learn how to do whatever you want to do.
---
There is also Eve University, which does similar training in a more classroom-style environment.
---
After playing in one of those corps for a while, you'll have a better idea of what you want to do, and a much better idea of your criteria of what makes a "good" corp for you.
---
This:
---
Mar5hy if you want I'll give you some lessons on NPC deployments and dread bombs. My dreadbombs resulted in coalition failcascades, mass exoduses of alliances, the dissappearance of corporations from games, and entire regional economic crashes so just give me a heads up when you wanna learn a thing or two instead of feeding dreads over and over.
---
Because people's market alts are at Jita and they can't be bothered relocating to some keepstar owned by a Goon SIG.
---
Also it gets shot at too much.
---
So judging by the warp in of the Bombers, and your [fleet layout + Who is on grid](http://prntscr.com/mmwumm), we can assume that the first bomber to land on grid is probably the only person that can do any type of squad warping, since he was the first to land we can deduce he def made the warp command or is higher skilled than the others. For the first to be true which would indicate Olmeca is not input broadcasting and one toon is higher skilled than the others since one [previously aligned faster](http://prntscr.com/mmwx8m) and entered/exit warp before the other, the why is it when they are [warping off grid they are all warping at the exact same time](http://prntscr.com/mmwvwx) once the first one slows down to the same speed as the others.  
---
[And no he was not in the same warp bubble as the others.](http://prntscr.com/mmwwrl) 
---
I had to run to Hi from W-space to pick up some station cans. Some people saw me leave in an itty 5 and hung out on the hole until I returned a while later. (Including some quick market pvp, buying all the cans in the region and putting back o the market at a silly price. Yes I made the investment back from people in a hurry ...) So I come back and die with two cans in the hold. My killers filmed this and posted the result to youtube, including their cries of agony after the disappointing drop. Enjoy - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2c9eKoLr\_0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2c9eKoLr_0)

Must of had a kill right then

[I blame Kendarr for this.](https://my.mixtape.moe/malaty.mp3)
---
Go on....
---
nah I don't think they are a bottle neck, 
---
subcap fights still make up 90-95% of everything going on despite what r/eve says. 
---
Sure some people might loose a couple dreads or 200 or so from time to time but mineral availability isn't really the bottle neck on replacing those.
---
Mining wise theres a natural attrition rate of people who go, "I can totaly mine to plex my account / build a super / titan etc" then they start up there farm / inject, then they do the activity achieve the goal, most realize they made a mistake, or achieve the goal of building a thing.
---
Most go jesus building things to sell isn't worth my time or effort.
---
Then sit on the rorq(s) in case they think they might need mins at a later date, or sell the ship extract the sp.
---
nah just suspect timer
---
If you have probe out they are now automatically recalled :)
---
I think you look at damage in a different light, which is fine.
---
Losing drones to rats, or booshers, or killers is simply the cost of doing business, so to speak, for delve miners.
---
When you have to replace a tire on your car due to a blowout or picking up a nail is a similar situation. Most people just chalk it up to a bad day, and replace it. Was it what you planned on when you woke up that morning? No. Is it the end of the world? Nope. Just the cost of doing business. 
---
Your accomplishments are what they are. But your train of thought on how you affect your targets is completely and absolutely wrong. The argument is not wrong, or false, for stating "already replaced". 
---
You seem to want it to be something more than a flat tire, but it isn't.
---
TL:DR- One toon lands before the others, then the rest land which should indicate skills/fits are not all EXACTLY the same, however when exiting warp they are all identical. Case=Isboxer main client had a different server tick then the rest
---
Do you plan to frame this and auction it off?
---
Yes! That's a great idea
---
That would be me. I ran guardians gala sites for a couple hours and got nothing but some fireworks.
---
Thermal is alright more often then not
---
You are completely full of shit saying you have never lost blue loot. Maybe not delivering it. How about collecting it?
---
EVERYONE has lost blue loot at some point. Even if it's a meaningless amount. EVERYONE has.
---
its not a bug, you can turn the feature on or off in the filters.
---
I took down a VNI that ended up having a cyno fit but never lit it. Sure enough a second VNI came to the same anom just as they were dying, likely to their rescue, and promptly got scrammed/webbed and killed within a quickness.  Gotta love that.
---
You literally said JFing the loot
---
Bring the goon reddit brigade
---
Needs more Bombers Bar logos.
---
One declocked first rest bumped into it.
---
Time wise looks like 2 tics on a the recall. 
---
The funny thing is a lot of missing data on the time such as scan which that in itself is 10sec + warp time and those excavators are moving 1km a tic.
---
My personal thought is x3 screens with the carrier behind those 3 rorquals.
---
I tried to engage a seraph gang in honorable sub cap pvp, dude + gang logged off instead :(
---
So your complaint here is, someone might make more isk maybe?
---
Not a great argument.
---
MMO sandbox? no i don't.
---
Lately my games of choice to spend my time on has been Crusader Kings 2 as well as Divinity Original Sin 2, the second one in particular has been pretty much killing my spare time lately.
---
Why would i give other people isk for selling stuff? I'd rather just pay more to the isk sink
---
I'm still trying to draw a good lossmail.
---
No, I'm saying it doesn't realistically change much given there's no need for anyone null ratting to haul it back to low/high to sell (which is what I thought was one of the benefits of this idea) when it's easier to just sell it for another 5% off
---
mar5hy doing anything
---
You should watch or read Log Horizon.
---
Plenty of good supercapital losses to choose from.

except bbtb was true with that statement
---
Do you see EVE dying in front of your eyes CCP?
---
ah yes querns with the “we’re the best because we’re innovative” big brain take while he lives under the biggest stagnant scap blob in the entire game big innovation plays like haven ratting and more rorquals :omegalul:
---
Do you really think people are calling olmeca an idiot for claiming 8 keystrokes a second "high apm" just because they are goons?
---
 Unsubbed. Fuck CCP!
---
well, its not a secret goons have a massive hate boner for him 
---
you know that i didn't say that, right
---
like i specifically chose a clever thing that someone else did to defuse exactly your dumb line of reasoning
---
Come back to us, Verone: https://i.imgur.com/DIptC96.png
---
That is true, but when you're as special as Olmeca, It's no miracle.
---
you may want to make a better straw man next time, because i never tried to argue what you think i was at any point in the conversation, you just launched into it with a preconceived conclusion
---
why, i don't know, but i suspect it may be because of the nametag on my post
---
what in the blue fuck are you even talking about
---
See he just did it wrong, you're supposed to high sec mine on your secret alt so you can build up a plausible backstory for your new spy character. 
---
Jita local is just so much more authentically EVE than that gentrified 'perimeter' place. 
---
Nah, querns, this is one of those tactics that people who argue all day on the internet thinks works but is totally transparent. 
---
1) Assert something in response to a comment that any reasonable person would read as disagreement
---
2) argue with people who respond back
---
3) if at any point it seems that people aren't agreeing with you, claim you never disagreed in the first place
---
It's not your flair querns. It's you.
---
Your ship is intangible while under invuln. Ships will fly right through you. Nothing but moving, taking an action or waiting out the timer should cancel the state. 
---
Was it the first time you undocked that character after logging in?
---
It's a bug when the filter is off. When it's showing every time you open the map, when the map don't open on your location and when the display panel is off...
---
It's not all in the delivery. It's in the collection as well. It won't all get collected. Trust me in that.
---
It's because you're part of a goon conspiracy to bot his gang or something?
---
They should have called it Dasher.
---
Don't get me wrong. I have moved away from using caps and having them used on me (mostly). I prefer subcap gameplay, and think that CCP needs to do something about supercap prolif... I mean you've heard it before, I don't need to go into detail.
---
But that doesn't mean that someone who is using supers in a way you wouldn't use them is a retard. I've had supers. I didn't get to use them as much as I wanted. I was happy to boson a dozen fuckers in a drag bubble rather than not even log in my titan character for months at a time, even if it maybe did mean I/someone missed out on some AF brawl.
---
I'm not really seeing how an MTU doesn't solve the issue of collecting your loot
---
The only way I see it being an issue is if you're clearing the site too fast (ie carrier) but that's what alts are for
---
Unless it's tied to salvage to be fair
---
tactics, lmao
---
you cherrypicked the example out of my post and made up some ridiculous fantasy about delve keepstars because ????? and tried to get me to argue a thing i never said in the first place
---
this is called a straw man
---
also nametag != flair
---
&gt;someone else did
---
Hard to argue it was cherry picked when it was the central premise of your response to olmeca. That's kind of, I dunno, your fucking point. This is becoming a massive waste of time, as usual. Thanks for the entertainment, querns.
---
I didn't say he was false
---
&gt; a nullseccer mining in highsec is a veritable monument of failure.
---
This
---
uh, no, not at all
---
the entire post said that the "wahhhh it's impossible better give up now" attitude is dumb
---
go back and re-read it, using some whiteout on your monitor to block my name if necessary
---
Sometimes they do put out design ideas - for instance the FAX changes that were proposed before the changes made in October came out. Those were poorly received and caused some blow back for the team that suggested them. While I do believe and support providing some of those ‘Here’s what we’re thimking’ kinds of communications, it’s not something that can or should be done with every potential change or design. 
---
Like I said, we as a community have been really harsh on some of the Devs and CCP as a whole when they’ve tried to go this route in the past and it’s gone badly. That doesn’t mean they shouldn’t keep doing it, but I hope folks can understand why it doesn’t happen more often. 
---
I will continue to push for more transparency, regardless. 
---
Oh, okay, I get it now. You're huffing a meme.
---
I don't get this meme at all. Why would you want to give Goonswarm Federation MORE credit than we deserve? 
---
I will keep doing my best to do that as long as I’m on the CSM. 
---
Back when I just started playing in 2010 I was hardcore into mining. It was good, but I grew tired of that fiery K (kernite). I read on eve wiki that there was dank ore to be had in nullsec. So I sold all of my possessions, so I could afford a thrasher. I asked the ceo of my week old 3 man mining Corp if I would get killed. He said “you should be fine as long as your not red to anyone” lol. So I fitted it with cargo hold expansions with all mining lasers and I put 2 250mm artillery on it in case someone tried to fuck with me. I jump through the 7Q gate and see all this bubbly shit everywhere but no one was around so I said fuck it and went on my way. 
---
     After I mined and my hold was full. I don’t think I even had enough to refine either. I headed back. I get back to 7Q and warp to the khabi gate. I didn’t land on the gate but I landed about 50 km behind it. That’s when I realized the purpose of these bubbles. So I start heading back to the gate. I didn’t fit a prop mod either. Instead I fit some dumb shit that had no purpose. All of a sudden a Sabre warps in 25 k from me and burns in. I locked him and warned him not to fuck with me lol. But he got closer so I fired my 2 turrets. It barely did any damage. I was shocked and panicking haha. Then he got in range and my ship just melted. I get wake up in the rookie station and lost sp cuz I didn’t upgrade my clone. The best part about this loss is that I sent the saltiest email to the guy who killed me. But, I found out he was Russian so he probably didn’t bother reading it.

I’ve been skipping breakfast and just going with coffee this time. I also try to pick up meals for the younger guys who are in tight budgets because I’m a big softie. 
---
You know thats my point.          
---
1. He did have isboxer setup for input broadcasting             
---
2. He had to manually enable this           
---
3. He "can" type into the chat without breaking the rules          
---
4. But he input to those chat boxes unintentionally doing something other that was much efficient to do while input broadcasting.               
---
Nobody wants folks to quit, but I have no idea how you expect them (or us) to fix misperceptions or things that folks believe ormassume is happening when it isn’t other than by telling folks they are wrong and why. 
---
TBH i see EVE dying, but maybe not as a game, but as something so many people loved (CCP earns so much without any investment) ...
---
Only when it’s some one in mackinaw, missing mids, in high sec, and with a 1.5b pod.
---
Yes, because each change erodes the core principles of EVE. The principles were:
---
- **EVE is a dark and dangerous place where real world morality is a hindrance** (eroded by forbidding gambling, pornography, swearing, "harassment", and generally making the place teen-rated)
---
- **you can attack anybody at any time anywhere and, in turn, can never be safe** (eroded by tethering, timezone-tanking sov and structures, as well as wardec immunity and CONCORD, and friendly-fire-illegal corps set to default)
---
- **loss is permanent** (eroded by asset safety)
---
- **skills cannot be bought or traded** (eroded by skill injectors which also enabled rampant botting)
---
- **every player is invested in the game because they pay money for a sub or are successful enough to generate sufficient in-game currency** (eroded by F2P Alpha, low-risk ISK generation, and botting)
---
These principles *were* what create a sense of immersion and value for the players. If you were clever enough to avoid all the hazards then you could really be proud of yourself, and this created a strong sense of investment. If you broke the game rules you'd risk losing your considerable time investment. They were equalizers that kept things in balance. 
---
To misquote Jefferson:  
---
*"Those who would give up essential Principles, to obtain a few temporary Players, deserve neither Principles nor Players."*  
---
No, just tired. 
---
Sure in the same way like many miners are not abusing isboxer.        
---
Live in your dreams ... but tbh go out on the sun sometimes, you are bit delusional 
---
Welcome to long resource loading
---
&gt; whenever a Rorqual pilot says "already replaced" when I steal 5 drones
---
Especially ironic since you're the one providing the replacements in a lot of cases.
---
The question is not just people vs isk sink, but what kinda people vs other kinda people vs isk sink. In my particular case, I would x100 rather buy stuff from the little guy that built 5 or 10 of whatevers and is desperatly trying to sell his order over the ones I mentioned. Taxes are an afterthought at best. But even that afterthought I'd rather give to the NPCs.
---
nah
---
This is the best post of this week so far. 
---
Back when my old Corp had just started renting in Period Basis, I had a real life friend join the game for a short stint. We were, of course, all about mining. We were in the middle of nowhere though, and we wanted boosts. Being in VYO, the closest Orca for sale was in NPC Delve...I believe in 1DH. Quite a few jumps, doubly so for an Orca.
---
We decided to buy it.
---
Flew up in our pods because dumb, I get there and throw a (at the time) 10mn mwd on it and some nanos, and we start gating this thing through Delve. PIZZA was around at the time too, so this was not a safe thing to do. We made it about halfway before running into a system with hundreds of people in it. Friend warps to the station in system to find a large fight going on. My Orca slides through unnoticed. We make it the rest of the way home. 
---
I've been in a wide array of fights, big to small, but my heart never raced like it did that day. We were the luckiest pilots in Eve that day.
---
That's not what olmecas post said at all, not that I expect you to do anything other than pretend reality is whatever supports whatever pants-on-head stupid claim you're making
---
Imagine being so asshurt all the time you need to act like a child when you seem someone with better micromanagement skill than you. You'd probably have an aneurysm watching professional SC2 players.  
---
This shit is getting older than Mar5hy's rage posts.
---
&gt; But that doesn't mean that someone who is using supers in a way you wouldn't use them is a retard.
---
I never implied that, at all. What I DID imply was that using supers in certain ways has implications regarding content.
---
Woosh
---
Top right, next to the manticore
---
how is he getting kills on his main if he's banned for a year?
---
Sounds like a bad Harry Potter spell.
---
you can show only accessible jb's as well as all in accesable jb's 
---
Rest assured, it was a bot.
---
Humans don't operate by clockwork like these did.  
---
If it were a human this wouldn't have been possible because the fleet caught him on the second catch attempt and the bot reset after a few minutes after the first whereas a human would never have gone back to ratting under the circumstances.  
---
You're right that the video doesn't demonstrate that this was a bot - but I'll attest that it was.  
---
needs more cosumate v's
---
Lol, lots of goon salt in this thread
---
Its not gay till the balls touch rite?
---
Live streaming RMT probably takes the cake for me.
---
Back country Wisconsin would be a hell of a lot better if i could find decent internet. 
---
Next tine try to add in some space rocks in that masterpiece
---
that's rich, coming from the guy who interpreted "here is a cool thing initdot did that everyone thought was impossible" like he did
---
maybe accusations of straw mans are giving you too much credit
---
using language like "guaranteed by design", not to mention his post history for what is probably going on a year now, belies some pretty shameful divestiture of agency
---
even still, it's immaterial to the point of you making up some bullshit then doubling down on a straw man when it was caught out
---
even if i'm wrong about what the olmaca guy said, you're still bad at reading comprehension
---
Now add some vertical lines and you've just drawn everything I love about the game!
---
Sweet. Does it have the Pyrionflax soundboard? I can't find it.
---
*usually
---
I like it. 
---
What if the first one was merely a bit prealigned because it was the client I was using to fleet warp the rest of the bombers, and I manual cloaked it out of habit upon gatejumping? What if those bombers all had previous movement speeds because they were trying to ditch a gate bubble before warping, yet the first one was aligned to a different point, because it was the best path to get out of the bubble?
---
All in all broadcasting evidence is inductive and falsifiable (apart from CCP logs). Any Rorq broadcaster can argued to be not broadcasting when he is, and any hmultiboxer can argued to be broadcasting when he is not. At the end of the day inductive evidence counts. I don't broadcast because I multibox for a living. And I twitch my activity to provide full proof. A spodbrain miner is likely to be a broadcaster becauase he doesn't provide such proof. And chances are he doesn't pvp or multibox for other purposes where you actually need to be fast.
---
That's not a bug. You can filter it to only show ones you have access to...
---
... Or, you know, plot a route directly to the jump gate of someone else only using the map.
---
If you online jump gates anywhere in new eden everyone can see it.
---
You talking about mar5hy or me? This is me on the video.
---
They didn't decloak. They were warping uncloaked, landed on grid at the same time because fleet warp.
---
Watch as they claim to not care about the ones causing them salt then write more then 10 words to flame them
---
This is the type of reasoning that produces nutjobs like Jeffery Dahmer. 
---
Wow .. such a sexualized Corp culture you have in BL .. is there no limits anymore to this kind of behaviours.. 
---
That or perhaps less psychopaths 
---
There are plenty of answers on this post that sparkled more interest on me to keep playing. 
---
I just had a small session where I blown up my Merlin trying to attack someone on high sec (I thought I was roaming on low sec). Fight started great, the guy was doing a pve site and didn’t engage back very fast, so I had a few hits and I prevented him from warping away. I thought I would get my first kill finally. Then my capacitor got drained for whatever reason I am still too newby to know, and my ship exploded. Killmail shows Concord, so I think they can drain my capacitor?
---
Anyway, I talked to the other pilot and explained my stupidity. He promptly donated 50mill to compensate for my 10mill loss.
---
Community on this game is fucking amazing.
---
It makes me happy to hear you FCing in BL vids. Naliao quitting (again) really did wonders for you xD
---
How do you equate saving drones form dying to chatting in local with respect to unfair advantage? That's a bit delusional.
---
You are irrationally fixated on Mar5hy, possibly because you want to be liked by the nullbear composition of this subreddit. He likes to play at the allowed limit of CCP rules. But he is good for the game. He creates content and makes ultra safe null a little less safe. That's more than what you can say for a guy who's known best for a gate meme.
---
One become suspect Ehen a killright is activated
---
Literal 150 apm, that's basically impossible.
---
It's very unlikely these choices come from the devs and not from management/leadership.
---
Blue Tiger skin on Mantie pls
---
Maybe it’s this guy, https://youtu.be/bexWuHmV32A

'Bout tree fiddy
---
You know, you could have simply stated "I NEED ATTENTION" and saved everyone's time..
