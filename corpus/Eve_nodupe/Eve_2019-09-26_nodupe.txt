Hunters can use covert cynos. Covert cyno in and blops bridge a recon, light hard cyno, No problem. Alternatively you can Stage recons in each constellation you normally hunt in. Afk them or log them off. Move your hunter around active systems until you find something worth catching, then catch.
---

---
Ask any hunter, any real hunter, it doesn’t matter if your ship can light a regular cyno: hunting is hunting.

excellent choice of music. god bless.
---
Cloaks already exist.
---
100? So like a fleets worth.
---
I had an opportunity to go to one of their dev conference after parties a long time ago. They had strippers and midgets serving beer. Definitely was not kid (or wife) safe. They've toned it down a lot over the years.
---
Excellent, thankyou for the response.
---
&gt;	old Pandemic Horde was similar a monarchy with a royal court, but I'd guess that had a lot to do with being structured (at the time) around one massive corporation and a few tiny ones
---
You mean Horde has evolved away from being Gobbins as king and Nidia as the Hand? Do tell.
---
legit thought (or wanted [that], at least) this guy was looking for a corp to rp as a badass fighter pilot
---
What are you, an actually fucking thinking person? On r/eve? Gtfo man and watch from the side how they will add trig caps next update.
---
do u not see the problem in having to light a covert to bridge a recon to light a regular? thats a total of 3 characters to do the job of 1 from before the change. Thats really my main issue with the change: needing more alts.
---
omg ok &lt;3 I do have an external monitor connected...that might actually be it
---
Will give it a go, cheers! CCPlz, I'm tired of regularly re-installing EVE because shit breaks haha they need a launcher/game repair feature on the installer
---
Feels that everything that isn't directly monetizable has been cut :/
---
Really depressing honestly, stuff like this really added life to the game.
---
&gt; for obvious reasons im not going to specify where the pictures in question are on the internet
---
I'd think less of anyone who did. I don't know where they are, I don't *want* to know where they are, and I thank you for being classy enough to not link them here. :)

---
How in hell you keep pressing that 0 when the year of completion is clearly listed as 2222?
---
This is why you keep an eye out on balance changes. This was changed like 6 to 9 months ago.
---
If you were interested in a T3 that could be slippery to do PVE, but escape easily as well as do some PVP (frigates to battlecruisers and HAC) solo, would you go with a Loki, Legion, or Tengu?
---
I took a break, which is why I missed it
---
Oh thats a bad timing. Should have bought into plex at least :)
---
No problem.
---
They're adding a trig dread.
---
&lt;3 Pando
---
‘Invested money cost’ is called Return On Investment and is measured in %, otherwise this is *the* great writeup on eve trading and trading at all.
---
*looks at manager.goonfleet.com intensively*
---
You enjoy farming?
---
Isnt this all a metaphor for grief and being unable to cope with it? There not being a monster and all
---
I did many a chuckle
---
oh boy. 
---
what is wrong with people. why so salty about blackout?
---
 it was actually quite fun. just like 4-5 years too late.
---
accusing wormholers of being responsible for blackout is also ludacris...
---
this wish mainly came from the pvp community in general, for obvious reasons .
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
here a little story, comparing to whats going on with eve nowadays:
---
big city xyz has a part of town which is kinda hip and the place where most students and young people feel attracted to, so a lot of young folks live in that area , enjoying themselfes and the clubscene, parties, and overall very lively neighbourhood, appartments are fairly cheap as it might not be the most modern/safe part of town..so a lot of young people move there and as they enjoy it, they stay....over the years they grow old, are settled into the neighbourhood, make carreers, have families with kids and all that..and suddendly they be like " man this neighbourhood is way too loud, way too many party folks on the weekends and overall too much stuff going on, shit needs to calm down" so instead of simply moving to quieter areas of town, they suddendly demand the complete neighbourhood has to change to cater to their needs now..and then they start petitions and city council meetings and all kind of crap...and act surprised when the young folks which are still attracted to that area arent amused about it at all.
---
because ," hey, why should they be allowed to have the same fun in the same place, i had fun in, 10 years ago......"
---
i think this compares pretty well to eve.
---
if eve is to hard ( buhuuu i need local...) maybe..just maybe...play something else.
---
dont ask to make the game easier and easier, just because ur life changed....look at fucking wow..that game became hello kitty online.
---
also, if u cry about no local in 0sec...gosh i dont wanna know how many tears u will spill once u play an eve version from like 2010 ish..with all the " balance" it had....
---
Not really sure what the politics in Horde are like these days, just what they were like when I was a member, so I framed my comment to specify that.
---
But I will say that it makes me sad to see Nidia rise to a position of authority. I've never met a more toxic asshole in this game, and it's not like our player base is lacking for competition.
---
Sounds like it's about autism
---
this whole post is ridiculously dumb.
---
and i thought my posts would be gringeworthy. this one tops them by far.
---
You are so wrong, this is the proper theme https://youtu.be/e20DtUJDxDg
---
&lt;3 this was the problem. Thank you.
---
I actually had to disconnect the external monitor and maximize the program through the task manager to finally get it to show up. Much appreciated.
---
I keep r/eve in my feed for the same reason. 
---
After years of waiting, seeing that they continue adding new imbalanced ships to a long imbalanced meta.  
---
Seeing that they cater exclusively to coalition level gameplay even though the blocs haven't produced news worthy content in years.  The blocs main concerns are game breaking safety of space, content ruining blob warfare and elite pve, and the main balance of players have long since shifted to pve players. 
---
And knowing the only way they can bring Eve back to its old pvp glory is to piss off a ton of pve, bloc payers, I've lost all hope.
---
So pretty much, laws for known knowns, and convention for known unknowns.
---
CCP: We only care about ratting botters.
---
Players: lol who gives a shit about exploration bots they are easy to catch
---
“I’m afraid I just blue myself”
---
she didnt accidently post them, she was ehoeing around lowkey then got a job doing someshit at CCP, when that happened the community went into full sperg posting them everywhere and spamming them ingame and shit. Claiming that she was blowing ccp members for a job. Then she dissipated.
---
true and still actual. not all missions are smartbomb friendly but  approx 2/3 of missions let u  use them with no risk
---
maybe by removing those damn highsec npcs that rape shit. that would be a good one
---
yea that's also why he later got banned for rmt and they removed gambling from eve
---
I unsubbed my 10 accounts when they removed blackout.
---
Everyone is being super supportive and if you’re dead set on doing it take their advice.
---
That being said, my honest take is - unless you have a full separate itinerary for your family, don’t do it. They’re going to be frustrated and bored - either you won’t be around to do family things, or they’ll enormous 3rd wheels to your EVE activities.
---
Just my 2 cents, its a bad idea to do EVE Vegas in particular with family, let alone any other EVE meet
---
Hey, I want to spend a week trying to kill explorers and exploration bots, how should I go about it?
---
I’m thinking Strat/dictor tag team?
---
[Space Cowboy ?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DX9rKumF5Ao)
---
Yeah i'm a Bebop fan haha. My ship is even named The Bebop on EVE.
---
I'm a bit old-fashioned so [THIS](https://youtu.be/2lpeFfAA2LQ).. 
---
And lyrics work pretty well with how nullsec actually is.
---
The whole thing was stupid.  You can't warp--especially outside the one system, dock, reship, and get back in 60 seconds.  You're an ass and you're dumb.  Double whammy for your family.
---
Yes.
---
“The monster” was her not ever getting over her dead husband.
---
I also hated this fucking movie. I kept wishing the kid would just die, but he never does. So annoying.
---
If I jetcanned something, abandoned it, and picked it up, would that be enough of an air gap?
---
It can't.
---
We can only hope.
---
what are those NPC's?
---
The database server just had a heart attack.
---
The covops trig ships will be the best
---
Many words of wisdom here.
---
Eve is basically a PVE game now
---
Either the trigs or Concord
---
They're within the link he provided lol
---
You will fit right in.
---
You lay so much blame at the feet of wormholers, I am intrigued as to what they ever did.
---
So you live in New Orleans then?
---
Honestly, I have no fucking clue. I just remember that I'm always looking for the artistic spins, allegory, metaphors, etc, but I just came out of it thinking "HOLY FUCK THAT KID IS ANNOYING" and "CALM THE FUCK DOWN LADY"
---
I want unique blood raider hulls for all the battleship and up
---
Yea that’s fine, you can always say you found the wreck where ever, just don’t be seen.
---
You’re saying patience is a big deal, I got some, where and how would you do it if you had nothing better to do?
---
Obviously the environment down here is all salt. The ceiling is salt, the floor is salt, the walls are salt, and to an extent the air is salt.
---
You have to mine out the normal belts to get them to spawn Frist though.
---
Well. if you can convince your boss "please give me overtime so i can spend less time grinding gold in my video game"  
---
Then yes,
---
just another log tossed on the "this costs money and doesn't make us any" fire.
---
instalocking NPC trig frigates randomly camp gates and point you then do insane dps due to trig weapon mechanics, and you die unless you are extremely well tanked, or have a few friends. 
---
It has completely decimated high-sec mission runners etc.
---
I mean right after they nerfed the Dramiel and Cynabal for being massively overpowered peices of shit, they immediately added the Orthus and Garmur that were broken in basicly exactly the same way (nearly uncountable range control that can fuck off and disengage at will with little to no risk)
---
I got screamed by a caracal today in null and I was super hoping it was this fit....but just boring old extenders and rapid lights
---
Ill take the koreans over hilmar
---
I called that margin.
---
I mean there are three investments : 
---
1. periodic costs eg the fuel for the structures (and also the structures themselves when people blow them up), the plexes.
---
2. one-time cost like bpo and toons skills / SP.
---
3. per-item costs, which is itself divided in time cost (the time required to craft one item and its required items, isk costs (from cost index) , freight cost(typically the volume of an item), and of course material cost
---
I add the time cost partially in each item I produce, based on the time required to build that item(see below)
---
I personally ignore the one-time cost, because I funded it using ratting - and now I can fund it with the benefits. So far I have over 50B of bpos researched to high values (subcaps modules and ships are 10/20, all fighters are 10/20, most cap and structure modules are over 8/14 ). If I wouldhave to set a cost for the one-time, that would be based on the researched bpo value, so SO from NPC+ time to research \* cost index + price to research(actually the price is very low compared to the time)
---
I give a price to the time to build to take into account periodic costs, in my case it ranges from 100 to 300 k isk/h. That means that three toons working non stop with 10 lines each would make 100k \* 3 \* 10 \*24 = 72M/day, so 1b7/month, which is the price of the plex.
---
I also consider a fixed amount per m³ (I think it's 50isk) so if I need to move a freighter for half an hour I would get 50M isk. it avoid making eg ships, that are not worth due to their high volume.
---
When I take all that together, I multiply by 100/(10-margin), then by 100/(100-taxes-broker) and it gives me the price to sell my items. It tells me the price under which I should NOT start building nor sell the items. Of course I use the SO price for materials(actually I consider if I bought items and the price I bought them), and I put the items at SO.
---
I buy enough bpos to have one day for producing the items I need to produce. eg if I need to build 20 items and I can build 3 per days per bpo, I will purchase and research 7 bpos. I have a program that tells me which bpos are missing, which need to be researched, which materials I need to buy (Just need to press a button and it copies it to the clipboard so I use the in-game multibuy to get them).
---
It's a LOT of work to prepare. I think I spent more time designing this, checking the formula, etc. than ratting to get the money. Still I would not advice this with less than 50B isk just to invest in the bpos. In terms of resources, I constantly have over 50B in materials just to start the construction as soon as needed, and 30B of items sitting in Jita waiting for the price to increase. Also over 100B in SO.
---
I say this because I gave number of income, but forgot to give the amount of preparation and investment this actually requires. I guess I have over 1T just in assets (each of my toon is already over 100B worth, and that's without the bpos, the materials, the structures).
---
It's not  something that can be done easily.
---
Close! Australia :)
---
As posted in slack this morning about 8am eastern USA
---
&gt; So I decided to test a new ad network for 24 hours, i just undid that. I'm pissed they were displaying ads i specifically filtered out and I've gotten a shit ton of people complaining about mobile redirects. Fuck Adsterra (edited) 
---
&gt; And screw that guy who recommended them
---
For what its worth I maybe had adsterra in place for 14 hours. Not worth it.
---
I just signed up for BAT, looks like I already had ~78 BAT to be sent to me for the month, however if that equates to $12 USD it doesn't really cover much.
---
It will just be me, him and the wife.  The wife will love her alone time while he and I are doing Eve stuff, and they like time together while I do my own thing.  We travel enough that we have our dynamics that work handled.
---
Awesome. Thank you man
---
What did it drop, mate?
---
Yeah, I unsubbed all of my alts and mostly stopped playing. Plexing my main so I can still hang with my friends once in a while, but everything else is mothballed.
---
It's more annoying than anything. Instead of my nth hulk I just have a falcon or two cloaked waiting. More annoyed for doing jf stuff. Not a fan of these indy cynos.
---
Que?
---
I've had them drop in my PI hauler at a POCO, oh, poor Epithal.
---
OTOH,  having them drop on my moon miners just results in tasty salvage.
---
I wouldn't say adding a couple of skirmish ships is catering to the small gang.  It was definitely inconsistent after years of nerfing missile kiters and other skirmish ships.
---
I would say that fozzie sov was an attempt to bring actual small scale pvp back, that they failed miserably in the execution of.
---
Eve was best for pvp when there were multiple pvp corps in every region, ie, before the rise of alliances and n+1
---
Is that where they went in "Keep clinkin'"?
---
I'm not a moron, sorry
---
lmao I thought it was some highbrow drama about the woes of a (single) mother trying to deal with her down syndrome son or something
---
&gt; CCP minttits
---
"wait, did I miss a CCP guy? ...oh"
---
Cloak a rocket bomber in a relic site 200km off. When a explorer tries to run it, warp to the can at 0, double scram them, and kill them. 
---
If its an astero, be very careful, b/c a combat fit astero will easily kill a tackle bomber. But, if you have an alt, then just bring a t3c for the actual killing and just use the bomber for tackle. Although, doing that too often is asking to get baited and lose a t3c, wheras no one really cares enough to bait out a 50 mil bomber, especially if you don't camp that often.
---
&gt; I'd think less of anyone who did.
---
Having a prominent Member of f Ivy League thinks less of you surely is a blow to anyone's honour.
---
Yeah, that's the update I still read for
---
It happens thank you sir, I appreciate your work and will donate shortly
---
Fly what you want and what interests you.
---
Tengu isn’t as great as it used to be, but it’s good.
---
Loki got rebalanced and is now the best T3C.
---
Rattle rats really well but is also a big target.
---
I keep coming back expecting to see some big scandal drop that explains why people continue to play when space is so blue and dead.. it just doesn't make sense to me.
---
Also, just do yourself a favor and pay for the sub.
---
Use your ISK to have fun and do stuff.
---
Speak for yourself peasant....vendettas for life
---
yeah i went ahead and removed the link to that article i didnt scroll down far enough to read the comments. people are retarded
---
Delete rorq direct mining and PANIC. Delete supercarriers. Delete fax. Rebalance dreads to be top tier battleships for structure bash. No insurance on carriers. 
---
Keep titans as corp level strategic assets. 
---
Frigate - destroyer
---
Cruiser - battlecruiser 
---
Battleship - Dreadnought
---
1 citadel per system, 1 fortizar per constellation, 1 keepstar per region. 
---
Low power structures have no timer, they just die.
---
Nice
---
Only always dying and never once getting on any kill? So you're saying hundreds upon hundreds of players are creating explo alts where the literal only thing that character does is explo? Doesnt make sense at all.
---
None of these bots ever attempt to even get a kill. They are all 0 kills and billions lost.
---
You have clearly never met a carebear.
---
Some people DO NOT pvp, and couldn't whore on a kill of their life depended on it.
---
No worries mate. All we want is to play eve but the launcher has a notorious nature of giving us problems to deal with 😂
---
posts like these just make me sad :'(
---
Yes, those pesky carebears roaming Catch, the rest of occupied null, Npc null, and wormholes. Bc that's what carebears do. Take risks

Try that. Tanks 1.73k DPS. Of course, this is maxed out on tank. You'll want to have plenty refits, MJD, DDAs, BCUs, and application mids. Cost is a hair over 1B and you can bling down a little. You can also scale this up big time if you're willing to pay. You can get up to about 142k EHP and 3.6k /s passive regent but that’s way way over kill for a C3 (you can technically tank a C5 like that but you’ll be there all day and you might as well buy a marauder at that point).
---
I would like to take a moment from all yhe chatter to appreciate that if they are bots kudos to the developer who made the bot that dhit id difficult if the bots are scanning
---
I just check while I wait for skills to train.
---
I'm here too much.
---
Not saying these are not bots but When i started game the only thing i did was exploration and if ur in corp war dec is problem so better not to join . Also if u already have a relic scanned the urge to do that site again is very high . Yesterday itself i tried the rrelic siite 3 times after ganked there by astero/ hound then gamur/ hound and then loki . Loki was the signal so fking leave the site . I have exprience in scanning still i do mistakes . Sometimes forgot ecm drones , sometimes forgot to warp , sometimes forgot to strat repairer
---
Yay inwant to fly tue mothership 🤣
---
The point is, just check their zkill before engaging. If they look like a bot, or just have terrible astero fits, then go ahead and attack. But if you attack every astero that runs a site you're camping, you'll die quite a bit.
---
Get out of Jita. Local there is terrible.
---
Perimeter isn’t too bad.
---
What about a Nightmare?
---
Haha that would be amazing!  It would make me feel a lot better to buy it at a fair price though.  The main thing stopping me from buying them rn is lack of will to play market pvp.  PM sent with details if you're interested!

Huh, I thought - without seeing the movie, just clips - that it was about what it's like raising a severely autistic child.

But...but... triglavians!

If it makes you feel any better, I didn't see it either.
---
Or just perma run extender and drop the 3% dps
---
Send him to hard knocks 🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
Those exist to force you to actually pay attention when you're mining. Git gud.
---
Some ideas:
---
- Bring the Aether Wars demo to EVE in some fashion. The general gist: pour a bunch of players into a pocket, have them slug it out for the loot inside then give them the option of leaving the pocket or going til they're the last ship standing. Loot value would increase non-linearly to entice people to stick around. Pocket effects would be designed to gimp stealthy ships.
---
- Remove the ability to place items within a .1AU area around Jita 4-4. Place is getting clogged with mobile depots and MTUs.
---
- where dat Tiericide at doe, and if a buff to the Cyclone is involved with it I'd be grateful. Good active shield tank, but its DPS is very poor.
---
A future Eve player.
---
 Blood Raiders: A bigger Ashimnu that actually does some damage.  - can it be a Prophecy hull with the Blood Raiders skin?
---
Meanwhile I just went through a null system with literally 50 botting retrievers that are unscathed
---
Yes, carebears only pve.
---
Also no1 sells officer mods on the market due to tax
---
Most are sold over contracts
---
Because it's one of the trash-tier officer module(worse than X type)
---
It's bad enough that nobody would buy those and rare enough nobody would sell at the same time
---
Nearly anything except deodorant.
---
You know what would probably be an easy fix for PVE?  
---
Doubling all stacking penalties.
---
If that doesn't work, double them again.
---
This seems like a good one for most alliances' Reddit posters. So I'll just say TEST because of their origin.
---
Ok let me help you understand Tappits: All of us who like to roam in small gangs and solo without every ship we tackle lighting a cyno for 43 super caps think its great.
---
the graduates is a family friendly corp.
---
No
---
Fuck me, since the Arron is a tackling frigate it even fits thematically! Big expensive ship trying to escape into warp? Atron says “LOLNO.”
---
I come home from a Vegas conference the day before Eve Vegas starts. :(
---
There is EVE Echos play that when it comes out. I intend to
---
i don't see any proof.
---
you get id'ed at every club entrance and if you stick around tables or slots and a guard passes by. It's not a huge deal and they don't put you to jail just politely ask you to leave, I played a bunch of slots and blackjack without having a valid id and even got cocktails from the girls (always tip). If they do id they never check the picture too hard, so you can borrow a friend's id and use that, in my experience it was no problem :p
---
Ironic thread
---
What is once seen cannot be unseen.
---
I'd rather see the removal of armor slaves
---
I *know!* From now on, every time I look at an Atron hull I’ll be seeing “LOL” Guy’s face on the prow!
---
Goddamnit, where’s the brain bleach?!
---
catching those with sabre is not that difficult, you need bit of luck and scout on the other side,
---
I fly an Astero, I love that hot rod. 1.5s align time, you probably won't catch me~ 
---
... until I'm no longer paying attention because I'm too busy swearing at this damned can I'm tryna hack ^_^ no joke, camp me in the site, guaranteed kill mail for ya.
---
Yes. Most people are better off.
---
You lose agility iirc no?
---
....its a nag...
---
It's still long :p
---
Because 100% of all kills ever are on zkillboard amirite?
---
&gt; am i just bad or did sabers get a nerf 
---
You're just bad
---
No, you're just doing it wrong
---
Eve 2 or at least 2.0, I can see that happening, especially with the "help us test this Aether platform!" Runs they have done. I don't think they have the bandwidth for a sequel (what would that even look like?), but I can see a kind of "re- launch" when they perfect the next engine the game could run on. 
---
Unwarranted opinion: the other developments are stalled because (imo) they want a new platform out. Why fix your broken script when you might need to re-write it again later? Just build a new platform engine thing and fix it all later! (I'm not a programmer so there's a lot i am making assumptions on)
---
there is at least one character you posted that died in a variety of ships, days apart...
---
i doubt bots would do that...
---
also, did you ever hear about dedicated characters? especially in explo it helps sometimes to be able to log out on spot and play with the main character, as you can randomly locked in a system with 500mio loot
---
My guess is that the earliest date for big update announcements will be Fanfest 2020.
---
If you really want to experience the full awesomeness of the eve community, take the effort to come to a player meetup. That’s where all the friendships are docked. &lt;3
---
or the "Rote Armee Fraktion"
---
I spent a long time using a couple of C5's to make isk. Double and then later, triple-boxing battleships, killing the drifters with an ahus. I think i was making around 40bil a month with two wormholes, and would move my pilots back and forth between them about once a week. I was spending around 10 hours a week between the ratting, and the scanning/rolling and logistics. Listened to a lot of audiobooks while ratting, it was kind of nice.
---
I’m probably going to catch hell for suggesting this, but wouldn’t it make more sense for NPC mining fleets to be more common in hisec than low and null? I’ve been mining at the AMC for the past month and I hardly ever see one of those fleets in a belt.
---
it is false.
---
It adds more high skilled characters mostly.
---
Oh, thank you! I’m off to read that thread now.
---
SLPT
---
Yeah, I'm not watching that.
---
It was like the EvE equivalent of a freaking Yogi Berra quote. Does someone have a list of all the clips that was made from, BTW?
---
If it pves 
---
It’s a BOOOOOOOOOOOOT
---
mind
---
blown
---
LOL didn't you get the memo? Vegas was canceled...
---
Only if they fire hilmar the second they are able to do so and even then its going to be a fight for eve to survive.
---
But didn't you see, they have a road map, they call it CCPls, and its a joke, they have the last two months of stupidity, listed as "balancing" with the complete check mark showing. Hilmar is oblivious to the fact that he is killing the game and he isn't interested in hearing about it.
---
&gt;Hilmar's ass.  We sent in Mr Slave to try to find it, but haven't heard from him since the brownout...
---
I see what you did there, and I like it.
---
Nah, just release new ships so everyone can get hype.
---
They'd never divide the player base and run eve 1 and 2 concurreny, they haven't got enough active players. A re-release would have to maintain current status quo...so I think itl be more of a big upgrade like eve Trinity in the past.
---
Hardly.
---
Even autopiloting freighters through trig systems is safe.
---
They had drifters destroying everything for a while.
---
I think you can handle a few systems having trigs.
---
After all these years they should have a "ship editor" where they can see all info/stats of a ship and change the numbers without touching the DB-tables themselves... basically they should be able to "balance" dozens of ships every month by tweaking the numbers in the editor. 
---
They only reason i can think of why they dont do that is that they are basically undecided what to change and by how much and so they do nothing. 
---
If they really have to manually edit the DB for every change (because lagacy code, or whatever) then they should just switch off the servers and be done with it...
---
Most of them, even dying in similar situations are not dying constantly, and had almost all their deaths in similar time periods.
---
Which would be exactly like real players.
---
It was a pile of lazy STEAMING SHIT. Don't you start giving people unhappy with CCP's lazy half-assed effort shit for being angry about the latest round of "lets see if they get angry when we put zero effort into the game" changes.
---
All they confirmed was making lazy, one mouse click changes didn't solve the problem.
---
We're at that point in time when not hearing bad news on a daily basis is the good news
---
&gt;Yes, and in the post-blackout reality any investor that has braincells left won't touch this game with even the longest of sticks.
---
They already weren't doing that, which is why Hilmar felt pressured to sell the company, the existing investors wanted out and he couldn't find any new ones. So he gutted the company and spent a few years focusing on the bottom line until someone took the bait and bought this shit show on wheels.
---
Around 150m + Gila BPC, not awesome but decent.
---
We were killin it ♡♡♡  RIP blackout
---
I think you will be eating crow with your ragging on about blue loot come the next mer.
---
Guristas Pith-Penal Complex.
---
The biggest ISK sink would be a maintenance cost for all the crap you got your hangars.
---
Excavators are not that bad, but do not belong on a Rorqual with PANIC, same with (ice) mining drones for orcas and porpoise. I don't think drone based mining is bad in general, but it needs to be on ships with a smaller ore hold.
---
Capital ratting I would like to see polarized tracking enhancers for capital ships, this would also reduce how effective they are vs subcaps.
---
Also, remove gates to stain.
---
It is, but it's also a really annoying horror movie. You have to be able to deal with the two main characters in order to get to the Meaningful stuff.
---
.. damn .. you nailed it :(
---
No i will not. Minimal population is generating huge amount of isk.     
---
WH space can also sustainable moon mining now ^(without goo just ore) also all materials for T3 productions come from there.          
---
Not mentioning the relic sites.             
---
This don't have to be direct nerf to blue loot value or drop , but a nerf limited to C5, C6 WH.
---
Thank you!
---
Just park and cloak at a relic site
---
Tbh your first idea will kill the ingame industry as people will not stack up assets any more.        
---
Like honestly 95% of my 'value' is in the assets because if i need to operate in specific area i simply move in with 'predefined setup' and i leave this setup there if i need to use this area again.          
---
If some places items are laying so low i can start selling stuff as 'legacy fitted ships'.         
---
This acts as a nice material sink.         
---
Excavators are not fine as long as you can multibox rorquals.     
---
This scales to and actual limit of how many mining rorquals you can run is defined by how many clients your pc can run without melting.     
---
Capital ratting is more fine than rorqual mining as you simply cannot multibox this ^(except for very rare cases) but main problem of capital ratting is that it is injecting isk.           
---
Like keeping current capital ratting value and migrating 50% of it to materials found in wrecks is more than fine for me.
---
This is how you kill asteros lol. Or just bubble camp a gate with decloakers.. but that's alot more effort than it's worth.
---
I think you mean... Exotic Dancer
---
Check value of all T3C/T3D sales in trade hubs ... they are worth a lot.
---
Goonwaffe will build the first one, and PL will kill it a couple days later.
---
Having one of the worst PvE gameplay out there, it's quite an impressive feat.
---
Hoarding is helluva drug.
---
no, i'll help you get rid of it, just contract it to me.
---
You already have a plethora of cloaky wormhole ships at your disposal. Or are you thinking of the common man?
---
That's an ignorant argument. A lot more goes into the production of t3s than just salvage. It literally isn't worth salvaging WH wrecks anymore. Market tanked with nerf after nerf.
---
No it doesn't. Rise said as much during the black out. He was even talking about the potential to tune up rewards.
---
Follow is on. I'll drop in sometime to say hi
---
Gratz on a good string of content. Fleet invite astras in hostile staging are really one of the funnest things around right now. The content warps right to you =D
---
Official forums are pretty nasty too. Not overtly because of moderation, but you sure can feel how much effort people put into their thinly veiled attempts to insult each other in many, many words that aren't obscene separately from each other.
---
Salvage and gas is coming from WH space, same for materials required for invention.       
---
You can do reactions in WH space.            
---
From what i know only the minerals needed for R.A.M. can come outside of the WH space ... so we are saying about like few thousands of ISK in each T3 hull.
---
That loki .... :S     i hope these are free from an event
---
Was a ton of fun!
---
That’s not true .. it’s just why would u even sell a shit Tier officer rep and pay tax if no one buys it because deadspace reps have the same stats for 1/10 price ... but got stuff keine Smartbombs/hardner etc get sold
---
One of the gates into Sarekuwa, which is a Caldari State noobie system, had probably 9 Ibis wrecks on it a couple weeks ago when I resubbed. That was an invasion system which gives you a warning before you jump in, but I still felt sorry for those noobs that probably didn't know what the fuck an invasion was.

---
Salvage is worth shit and the delta between kspace gas and w-space gas has closed quite a lot.
---
Ah, the era of RTS. Or more like the era of RTS clones.
---
I don't quite understand the connection between hilmar and shield slaves in this instance, but you can keep screeching hilmar all you want, it won't mask your own shortcomings.
---
What fantasy land do you live in where this is safe? And again, the question is price delta between null gas and wh gas - it isn't huge anymore.
---
[deleted]
---
Yes but they will be inactive do to alpha state.
---
We need the cloaky AT ships made normal ships!
---
People stacking up assets and ISK for decades is killing the ingame industry as much as a maintenance cost would be. Infinite resources without maintenance means "moving in with predifined setup" is the best way to go.
---
It also means you can have stacks of capitals and titans ready for SRP and keep adding to that pile with no downside as well.
---
For starting purposes, you could get rid of free repairs at citadels again and slowly damage unused ships in hangars. Your active ship can be exempt. Put a cap on how much damage your ship can get (e.g. modules 50% damage max, max 30% damage for armor and structure).
---
Reducing the ore hold on whatever ship is doing drone mining means you can't do it semi-afk as much (reduce ore hold to so you have to empty it each time your excavators return or some of your excavators stop working the next cycle).
---
I like the idea of shifting PvE rewards from ISK to material, but it also comes with the added overhead of distributing the rewards when doing it with a group (IMO one of the reasons invasions never really got popular).
---
This is racist! 🤣
---
Sort of.
---
You can have the skill, but it's bonuses and the things it unlocks will not be available to you as an alpha.
---
Generally, injectors on an alpha would be used to get more than 5m sp of Alpha skills.
---
Well mainly, you would sell the officer rep at a lower price that is justifiable.
---
Some people are just idiots though and think they can command super high prices just from being rare.
---
If I could add one more thing to this, most of Eve's searchable 'how-to' web information is from the pre-Trig invasion. Noobs ask Google how to run agent missions, and nowhere in any article does it state that Godlike NPC's may be camping the gates near their home system.
---
Depends on what kind of data you want.
---
As someone who just got ganked by a triggy in my astero, lets just say CCP fucking owes me a new astero for this shit.
---
No they don't.
---
That's only if you want the neutral to get LP/standings, but you don't really need that at all.
---
Any and all data would do for now, I want to keep my options open at the moment.
---
the proteus is good in few specifics situations. the loki is good at everything : kite, brawl face tank, long web, cloaky... etc
---
We have found the best recruitment tool is to actually kill someone and then explain to them what they can improve on. We then tell them we recruiting new players and a lot of people join this way.
---
You're the one focusing on shield slaves, the rest of us are focused on his actions leading to a 30% loss of the player base.
---
SOE Battlecruiser Makes me Think and a Mordus Angel Battlecruiser Hot
---
&gt;Well done, you just explained the ccp business model.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; Also this doesn't change that the eve playerbase has become a group of neurotic crybabies, with you being a prime example right now. 
---
You literally just proved my point, CCP doesn't know how to run their own game, but fuck heads like you will still defend their incompetence to the death.
---
Was she the ucrainean with a hardon for russians or am i confuaing her with someone else?
---
Have you heard of Predds?
---
Ok again :            
---
1. This 'null gas' is not rly null gas as you can get it in lowsec and higsec.            
---
2. 'Null gas' is used for production of drugs and those drugs are mostly overshadowed by new combat boosters that don't give negative effects.        
---
3. 'Null gas' is very big in size and require a lot of hauling as it is found only in specific regions scattered across the New Eden. If you want to produce some drugs you need to first check where this gas can be obtained as quite probably you will need to haul it from the other side of New Eden.                      
---
4. 'Wh gas' is used for T3 production                  
---
How you can compare both types of 'gas' ??
---
Tbh
---
WH krab are already vulnerable. rage roll while green siege is a dead dread. some real corp want your bear hole, you loose your hole, your citadel and your stuf. T3 production? it's a fucking nightmare and a ton of SP required.  
---
so, yes, it's hard, dangerous and higly rewarding.  
---
I never understand wh guys. If you think WH Pve is broken, come do it
---
does checking whether they fucked up even more or not count?
---
I'm training towards sub-caps. Can this be done on a phoenix since I have torps 5 and cruise missiles 5?
---
I'd like characters to be unique again. Right now everyone can fly every ship with enough injectors.
---
We already have the activity tracker, so lets use that and set up some achievements. And these directly inject a skill for just one ship into the pilot (no skill book)
---
These ships should not be (much) different from the ship they are an upgrade to, but would clearly show that someone did something special in the game.
---
So example for exploration: you have to visit a list of landmarks across now Eden and Anoikis and as a result get the skill for a "Travelers Astero" which is just a fancy looking Astero with a 5point scan bonus.
---
Why not skins? Nobody looks at those anyway so its nothing you can show off with.
---
when i bought my webs for my titan, being able to message the maker, and tell him hes a super lucky dude to roll such good rolls was a nice feature xD
---
Sorry but i cannot force myself to PVE for like 2-3 years now.            
---
But honestly currently i am trying to spawn some officer as the only one i killed was during a roam in fountain like 7 years ago.           
---
I seen like 3 in Stain, but hell i am not shooting those ! :D
---
Don't forget to share those when you've found any said websites
---
Customer that's gonna be a pretty serious security breach for CCP
---
Have you ever heard of a bubble
---
An alpha trains up to 5M skillpoints and can inject up to 20M skillpoints total with alpha injectors. While in alpha state only alpha skills can be trained.
---
If you go Omega and train omega skills you can get more than these 20M. But if you fall back to alpha these skills will become inactive and can't be used.
---
I would like it but all are far from where I live
---
mizuro was the name of the webs i used to own,
---
they were 17km @ 60% so better than faction, but it was the 'worst' officer web available. still sold for 9-10bill
---
Of course there are but in less percentage than other games I think
---
You are missing the point here.          
---
Stacking up those items is not killing the ingame industry but what keeps it running.      
---
Even by CCP this is considered a material sink.          
---
I don't know how you do it, but i try to have stocks of stuff and hulls ready to go before a war so i will not run out of ships during it.         
---
After the war i am working on filling this up again.            
---
**What you are saying will not make eve better, simply more annoying**          
---
Like don't make game more annoying please.
---
Not OP in the slightest
---
yes, for the amount of time, get involved in PI, this mixed with ratting will make it much less of a chore. PI is a big thing to learn, it takes a while to master, but can really help. its more isk per hour than ratting, but your limited on how much time you can put into it efficiantly.
---
i fly a loki, the loki and tengu seem pretty similar, i found the tengu seemed to fit a strong tank and dps easier than a loki did, but the loki webs can really make the difference somtimes. 
---
i will say if you fit hams having an AB to mitigate damage might be a good idea whatever path you go.
---
In your dream
---
Himalayan salt that is.
---
Listen bud
---
Panfam is virus
---
Not the other way around
---
Whale hunters are probably quite happy, since rorq/super/titan saves are harder now and there will be more situations with a lonely rorqs/supers without a recon alt cloaked 200km above the field.
---
Reddit nowadays has more content then the game itself.
---
Dude, PL's logo is based on a  [Bacteriophage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriophage). Everyone knows this since 2009.
---
Sry to hijack but...havens, forsakens, escalations, abyssal, incursions etc... It is quite overwhelming for a newbro to understand how to do them and especially where to find them. Do you happen to have a good guide on hand?
---
You can inject skills, but omega only skills are active only when you are in omega state.        
---
There are some exceptions.          
---
1. PI - you can install mutliple planets and operate on them while alpha but you need to go omega to export any goods           
---
2. Industry - all jobs installed as omega continue while you are alpha, you can claim them in alpha status but you cannot install new ones        
---
3. Trade - as above, you can put up max orders as omega and manage them as alpha simply you will not create new                
---
4. Various support - you can warp ships even if you don't have skills on them, simply don't dock them.          
---
5. Clones - you can create maximum number of them and still jump utilize them if you are alpha, you will not be able to install new ones                   
---
6. Implants , yes you can put up +5 set in your head while omega and it will work when you move to alpha - same for T2 implants.             
---
7. Corporations - the limit of people in corp is defined by the skills of ceo, but it only go up. So you can form corporation at max skills and the limits stay when you go to alpha.                
---
8. Structures - you can deploy keepstar as omega ... and manage it as alpha.                            
---
There are plenty of such items. TBH don't know if some of them are still viable. For quite a while you could board a mining barge as omega with T1 strip miners and use it as alpha as long as you didn't dock.
---
I´m sure my next door neighbour dosn´t.
---
Why do you think panfam was known as Northern Blight and people want to eradicate it?
---
We want more new players to mine and rat with. You are welcome!
---
Remove Stain completely. Who will miss it?
---
Try Brave, it has a built-in ad-blocker that's quite effective.
---
Was zum Teufel ist mit deinem Benutzernamen los :D:D:D:D
---
Congrats you figured out stuff from 2009... I’ll tell you another secret but pssst don’t tell anyone if u create a new account and invite it with friend code and sub u get 15 days omega for free and 4 x24h accelerator for free
---
I apologize for the rude 'beg' remark.
---
I just refreshed &amp; saw that you're now verified. That ~78 was just 'seed' tokens by Brave, once the users catch on, the amount would multiply. 
---
I'm already tipping the fuck out of your website. o7
---
I am not totally new (I think this December will reach my third year), but still learning a lot.
---
I have one of those, I don't remember how I acquired it but it just sits in jita being useless.
---
Incursions make good Isk and social content.
---
Yes I do.
---
If you catch an Astero with one ship the Astero pilot is trash.
---
Same here,  I love industry especially super carrier production. o7
---
Damn, can´t hide anything from you
---
Eat me
---
3. Trade - you can put max orders as omega Orders behave normally and will sell/buy. You just can't change the prices as alpha because the number exceeds maximum number of orders given by alpha skills. You can only delete orders if you're over the alpha cap.
---
Needs more pepper
---
The guys that died like this deserve it
---
They should be in the standing fleet and big toy should be exempted from fleet warp/not afk.
---
Oh and an ennemy astra should not lived that long.
---
Catching them on gate is extremely improbable. Even with a good decloaker and a bubbler, they seem to slip out of the bubble and warp off before you can even get pointed in their direction.
---
Almost all of mine production is for our selfs (I had a little corp mostly of alphas), as I couldn't find something enough profitable in the few time I have to play.
---
That's this small area of space in which your knowledge and experience lives, right?
---
As long as the items don't get removed by either blowing up or you destroying them to remove some entries from your asset window, it's not a sink.
---
I am aware that introducing maintenance cost at this point will kill the industry. In the current state, the industry will be killed once everyone has all the ships they need in all the places. That might still take a while. I would love to see some statistics about ships and modules manufactured compared to them being destroyed. My guess is that the ships added to the game is a lot more.
---
There is nothing wrong with having stuff stocked before, during or after a war, but if you take a look at every army in existence, that requires maintenance and in some cases the budget for that maintenance led to the fall of an empire.
---
**Yes**, it will make EVE more annoying if you have a lot of assets everywhere. **Yes**, I think it will make EVE better in the long run.
---
you cant do it in 3 cycles. but its doable in 4 - 5 depending on skill. the anticap missiles are a piss pain in the phoenix.   
---
nag &gt; rev &gt; pheoxix &gt; moros ( stupid range )  
---
i actually prefer the rev more because ammo. and the cheap centi A type tank. and can have ewar in mids almost all the time.
---
Very good point. I usually teach new players how to make money, not give them money out of the blue.
---
Good film though. The kid is hilarious
---
The little astra that could's little brother.
---
Awesome list of kills though!
---
Nullsec is safer than HS.
---
&gt;Jokes on you I stopped playing Eve long time ago. Don't have the time for it.
---
But you still have time to shitpost here? Wtf is wrong with your priorities?
---
...Well...yeah...you saw the thing they based the logo off of....
---
I kind of like the idea of ships slowly deteriorating so you'll have to repair them from time to time. Realistic in that if they are not maintained they'd decay.
---
The idea of not getting isk but salvage/modules/items from rats in Nullsec would also be a good idea since it's supposedly an area where concord/empires don't police and have no influence in. Low and High sec as well as incursions should still give out bounties/isk rewards because with them you are presumably getting paid to do a job.
---
Not sure I like the ore hold reduction idea tho, Rorquals are a capital ship and they should be massive enough to be able to store a lot. The idea of making them a purely support ship however is gaining on me tho. If multiboxing them weren't so easy I'd probably be all for them staying as they are now but since they are so easy to use many of them it's kind of making them the only ship worth using. I don't mind the PANIC mechanic but since they are the best mining ship and has the best survivability they're just too good if you can use multiple of them at the same time.
---
I often see the citadels removed for anyone not in FW brought up. Why though? Amamake and Tama were always pirate havens, long before anything named FW was brought into the game. I’d understand it if it was limited to Black Rise, a region brought into the game with the advent of FW, and a similar region was made for the Amarr/Min zone.
---
A compromise would be to bring back the starbase charters in a big way, so any citadel in a FW system requires large amount of these from the controlling empire. With any FW corp of the correct affiliation exempt from paying of course.
---
These items are already in the LP store, we’re used when having POS’es in empire space. Instead of one charter (250 LP) per day it could be set at 24 charters per day per structure, one per hour to remain at high power, or even more. Would also help that factions LP store, and in turn that factions player base.
---
TBH I can't really compare them as I have only flown a tengu and drooled over the loki.
---
All of them can be fit for interdiction nullification and warping while cloaked; that is how you get slippery. Keep a mobile depot, and refit in system at a safe to actually run sites. Bascially you will have two fits (with overlap) and carry them with you.
---
For PVE strictly, I don't think it matters very much, since you can tailor your tank. For pvp the loki is arguably the best single ship in the game right now. The reason is easy to see too, do you have pyfa? If not, its a great fitting tool, highly recommend.
---
Pull up all the T3 cruisers in pyfa on tabs, no modules, no subsystems, just look at the hulls, do you see how the Tengu has a massive EM hole and the loki has no hole at all? 
---
That means, in PVP a tengu has to either use an extra mid slot or two to close that hole, or risk being vulnerable to EM. Meaning, all things being equal, the loki gets a free mid slot it can use for a web, while the tengu is still fitting tank.
---
Since PVE damage is more predictable, so its a lot easier to just specialize the tank and leave a big hole.
---
I disagree with doing level 1s with the new guy. Level 4s are just more enjoyable. Even rookie ships end up oneshotting stuff in level 1s, they wont learn anything. Id say t1 frig abyssals are the best if they are able to keep up on the level 4s.
---
Get away from the place so I can't see them
---
Help who you can help. there will always be lost cases. Help with advise that's all you can do.
---
We cant change the fact Isk is easy to buy. we can only help with advise and mentorship.
---
im sorry but in month 1 you struggling learning the interface. telling them they need to jump into level 4's with you and abyssal is nuts. if you not willing to jump down to their level then you will just be speed running their experience. which is the issue that I raise.
---
You state level 1's are not fun. They are for a brand new player and that is what the mission are catering for. They not meant for you and me stating jumping down to a level 1 is not for your enjoyment but for you to teach them and explain to them mechanics and interface while they doing missions.
---
Something given has no basis in value.
---
and then there are alpha clones who when asked about exploration hear to get cloak so they grind endlessly the high sec asteroids to buy 500 plex but they burn out far before that
---
&gt; Spending an hour to grind half dollar worth of isk is really hard for a player from high income region to justify.
---
I'm serious right now: videogames are not a hobby for you.
---
So...Burn Jita? Or, literally just how null/WHs/lowsec(ish) works right now?
---
I'll never not SRP brand new explorers that I murder in my wormhole
---
Pro: EVE will die.
---
Cons: r/EVE will still exist.
---
Considering this change was targetted at giant null blocs, it really doesn't change anything except for the fact I now have to have one of my reaction pilots undocked and cloaked on grid.
---
The cyno change.. is a change by definition but ultimately didn't really do anything. Now IMO (I am a goon so grrr bias) I'd prefer they bring back black out and tweak cynos in a.. less drastic way, had the thought of maybe adding a time delay for the jumpee based on distance that increases per ly.
---
As an alpha I don't have much option for mining which I enjoy and would like to find some peoples moon mining operations to mine from. Any tips on how to find moons which are in the process of being mined?
---
Ever heard of titans? They don't truly mess with the balancing as they are very expensive
---
Sure if eve is the first game they have ever played do the level 1s. As long as you explain the approach orbit and keep at range buttons they can do the level 4s. You only need to know the basics to do them.
---
Englis is funny
---
Maybe we get one hundred 2004 leet vets to storm the CCP HQ and purge , @falcon I’m coming for you baby !
---
Well without concord. And without knowing who killed you. 
---
Perhaps just wishful thinking - but also inspiring some blue on blue action
---
No no no - no hand chopping!
---
All nullsec would just turtle up. Probably half of WH space, definitely all of highsec.
---
That's why they got swords at CCP HQ...
---
GiGx and evil Thug would be among the first people there to purge 😀

Hey! Sorry it's taken me so long to respond but shortly after I sent that email I started having seizures and I've been in hospital overnight with something called "hypernatremia"? Anyway I'm feeling much better now but my Doc said to stay off /r/eve for a while so I'm going to lay up. o7
---
Pffft I have a full DPS polarised Apoc ! Those swords will melt right in front of their eyes !

Yeah thats probably true. Alliance wide undock bans would probabæy be the result.
---
Idea hereby confirmed as being shit! :)

Wait wtf? This entire sub is nothing bu shit posts and "reeeeeeeeeeeeeee fuck ccp" Memes are posted here regularly wtf is your problem? I have been a certified r/eve shit poster for years now and after all this time now you decide to nerf me? FUCK.

Does this have anything to do with The Donald about to get impeached and jibrish being a hard core trump supporter?

Let me know which weekend it is, so I can spend it doing something more interesting.

I too am a hoarder of stuff :)

Remove the extractors from the game, and introduce Fast learning skill certification ,  learning faster than Omega, but costs extra just like multi Pilot,

Raznaborg 2-4 frigate gangs do not point. They have 0-2 standard Raznaborgs, 0-1 Starving and 0-1 Renewing, usually. 
---
They haven't "decimated" high sec running. Any Level 3 or 4 mission running ship is perfectly fine to survive and either get away or kill them.
---
Also they don't do "insane" damage, trig damage increases over time and starts off small. Fights with the roaming frigates don't even last long enough for more than 1 of them to spool to max dps.
---
I agree they are a hassle and they did blow up 250 mil worth of mining drones for me; I also agree that new players will definitely have trouble fighting them. 
---
But it's not as bad as people make them out to be.
---
You understood the point.
---
Na, this is the point you guys never understood about the blackout. When you remove counters thats when you make players passive, not the other way around. Sure, you can close down a dead end system and try to survive through it but that isnt fun. To constantly live on the edge whilst doing what should be calming isnt fun. That is a stressor and nobody would manage that long term, thats a fact. Thats human psychology. Thats why that test was irrelevant, you cannot press people to the max to get any relevant data regarding moderate changes. It does not work.
---
Eh na. Thats just a bunch of nice words that dont mean anything.
---
So the other massive outcry against CCP which resulted in a shitton of sub losses doesnt compare to this event which resultated in a massive outcry and resulted in a shitton of sub losses? And it wasnt based in a unilateral decision by CCP to change shit people said they didnt want?
---
Now youre just nitpicking again to not have to agree to something. That was certainly an expansion in Eve terms. They even added destroyers didnt they? That is most certainly an expansion. All that is speculation. PA didnt buy the game just to kill it, that would be massively stupid. So at some point they need to actually take care of the product or they will have lost hundreds of millions of dollars. Now will they be worse for players, i have no idea. But CCP isnt good for the players no either so.
---
Everything will die mate. But you dont need to do crack while driving 200km/h to ensure it happens faster.
---
So what is the proposition here? We as players should have done what? Not dropped supers on the sweet loving small gangs and the game would have been saved?
---
Then give up dude. In fact you should consider the same irl by your style of argument. Because you will never fix the world. So just give up. Why even do anything? Why even speak up? We should all just sit there and continue to pay CCP and play the game even though the blackout was clearly unfun for the majority. Cause if we dont people are gonna say we killed the game. Its fking bullshit dude.
---
Dude, the biggest content creators were against the black out. Dont try to make this into something it wasnt. The blackout was insanely stupid and anyone who actually lived and did stuff in null would tell you that. You are trying to pass it off as a "not great, not terrible" kinda thing. You are fking wrong. Just accept it. They went to far, they burned their hand. Thats it. Dont blame the stove.
---
And blocs have a shitton of dedicated players as well. This is propaganda. If you stop for a second and actually consider people in the blocs to be human beings instead of cows then you will perhaps understand some things better.
---
Brilliant
---
Permaban all nullbloc leaders who do not actively FC (ie create content)  
---
(maybe extend this to ban all diplos too, fuck diplos)
---
Yes, there are and in every area of space.

Wot

Lmao just go to wh

indeed, everybody who gets killed is trash .... get a life dude

Fuck off StainGuy.

Everything in choas era fucked pve null in favor of pvp lmao

Thank you for this ibformation, i do understand, im a lone wolf in eve so this ship wont do much for me, so i ended up getting a megathon ship, i dont think i spelt it right. But i just tested the nestor and its a good ship, but much like the uss enterprise, its not good for combat.
---
But thankfully the nestor requires battleship skills of gellente and amarr. So that means i can pick from the two factions so i dont fully waste my time.
---
I mean, when was the last time they actually invested heavily in this game? You are saying like everything was all peachy pre-blackout. We are literally in this situation because of the years before and not because of the BO.
---
I as an investor would look at the big picture. I see a dedicated fanbase which are willing to pay more for this game than players in other games are willing to do. But it requires actual effort and investment to keep afloat, not to be used strictly as a cash cow for years on end without actually reinvesting. 
---
And you are still just downplaying what the BO actually was. It was a massive change that the majority didnt want and even worse, argued extremely hard against. Wow, what a shocker that it didnt work. It was probably the dumbest thing CCP has even tried to do because they already had data to show what would happen since local has broken multiple times in the past years. 
---
So please, dont sit here and pretend like a) it was a small change and b) that they handled this shit properly. Their entire tone was filled with bile and toxicity, even going as far as to say that they are okey with people leaving the game. This entire thing was a shitshow by massive proportions and it cost them. And as an investor I would fully expect it too happen and would actually be glad cause that means the players give a shit. And giving a shit means money.
---
Show of force implies malice. This was a shitchange to punish the majority and got treated as such. People didnt wanna be punching bags for 18 months. 
---
But what you are doing here is whiteknighting CCP. They fked us but you are backing them.
---
&gt;but right now (on mine) the graphs are greyed out
---
Pretty sure that was a bug from a month ago that got fixed, check updates?
---
Just anchor another baitadel
---
Give a pilot ISK, and he/she will pewpew for a day. Teach a pilot how to make ISK, and he/she will pewpew for a lifetime.
---
OK I will bite
---
So when you started the game you got to the character creation section. read all the bits you need. made a choice based on the info you got from them. you crafted who you are based on a idea. a idea you had about being in space and doing things in this game that you could not do in others. You launched in and get some basic tutorial missions or in my case nothing. its massive. I am a capsuleer in space and this is my new adventure i tell myself. What wonders await me I think.
---
Private message from Captain\_skinback accept yes or no. I will accept.
---
Hey I see you new. come do level4's with me. you know how to orbit right? yes. cool. fly here and come shoot stuff with me...  ok.
---
Can you see the issue? The new pilot has a vision of what they going to become. Pirate, Manufacturing super giant, PVP fleet commander commanding 1000's. Hey come do level 4's with me kills that. they simply lose that story line they have created for themselves in their own mind and has been replaced by orbit this. shoot that. This is not your job in the game but the game tutorials job to teach them this. 
---
Level 1's are easy because it makes them feel like they this pirate hunter or killer capsuleer on a rampage of destruction helping these corporations on their missions.
---
You cant get that vision back of what your toon is if it gets disrupted by vets. allow them to learn and reward with mentorship and advice. don't fast track that and allow them to lose that vision just because you think level 4's are fun.
---
&gt; See a new pilot and they are struggling in the game... give him 10 or 20 million and he should be fine.
---
Its easy to forget how much this is when your new. I played in high sec for a while, and even after a few months I was working hard for scraps....
---
I got recruited to null sec and was offered something like 5 million just to get my ass out to null and say something on comms. I was like holy shit 5 mil! Damn straight I am setting up comms for 5 mil!
---
Its funny too because I had a billion isk from selling a plex, but I wanted to make my isk in game going forward so I was grinding, and high sec grinding is not very profitable.....
---
but I didn't know that! I literally though making 1 mil in like an hour was good, and because I thought it was good, it was good.
---
Which seemed to indicate that majority subbed players are null pve.  And showed how deep a hole ccp dug I've over the past 10 years pumping bloc play over organic pvp.
---
10/10 fights, please come again.
---
Next time check the context of the message you are replying to :)
---
nah her youtube channel is still up im p sure if u wanna see who she is
---
Most people i know (inclufing me)that do null pve do it plex or fund other activities like pvp
---
Hello. That's may well be us. We are Amarrians and have an outpost there for study but mostly as a spiritual retreat. The EVE gate is a big deal to the Amarrians.
---
200000dmg wrecks
---
You could join a corp that does moon mining and mine alongside them. You'd profit a lot from their orca boosts if they're using one too.
---
Come by my channel "Combine External Router" sometime and I can put you in touch with a number of rp corps/alliances.
---
Its a common misunderstanding non Technical people have not just of coders in general but of CCP specifically.
---
Just because CCP has been working on this game for closing in on 2 decades and just because all the cyno change did was change a 1 to a zero in the code of most ships doesnt mean that CCP are actual competent coders and know what they are doing.
---
Supers can't go in wormholes both because you need sovereignty to produce one (so you can only build regular caps like dreads and carriers) and because they don't fit into any size of wormhole.
---
No they nerfed the number of people playing as well.
---
From what are you taking that i am defending ccp?  
---
I'm saying that the playerbase is also responsible for the health of the game (albeit to a smaller degree than ccp).  
---
If we as players start unsubbing in droves because ccp are trying out more drastic nullsec related changes, then i am disappointed in our community.  
---
I always thought that we had more fight left in us to keep the game running. Maybe i was wrong.
---
Is there a way we can switch that around. Eve Online continues while r/eve is burnt to the ground and has all its posters driven away by bad decisions from Hilmar?
---
Best advice from me is to recruit them. If you think you dont have spies in your corp then you are a fool. If they new like that and they out in WH and doing exploration. Teach them about tripwire and get them to scan your home hole and bookmark the connecting wh's.
---
You get all the connections scanned and they get to do exploration while you mentor them but dont push them into something if they dont ask for it. Saying to someone that exploration is silly or dont do this because of this is the worst thing I find. They enjoy doing what they doing. Allow them to experience it for themselves but be there when they need a change. Why dont you do some exploration hunting now. So do what you where doing but become the hunter and they get a sense of omg that so cool... YEAH!!! So I hunt other exploration guys? Yes.. hehehhehe
---
Grinding isk to buy ships is a time honored tradition.  Loads of pvpers will do a little warm up / cool down / slow time ratting.
---
Grinding isk to buy plex is tedious.  I think is been proven is bad for the game.  PLEX was and still is a huge mistake.  Injectors more so.
---
Shield slaves were mentioned as being in the works last year, then hilmeth takes over and suddenly they disappear into the black hole that is hilmeth's short attention span to make room for "Chaos"
---
Plex is good to control inflation since it ties isk to real currency
---
Please let it happen in Jita. Please let it happen in Jita.
---
Literally all these bots do apparently.
---
Well idk I see plenty of it in 0.0 and on reddit threads so I'd say its probally the same as in other games
---
I didn't spend many time in 0.0 yet, so I will see when we increase activity there.
---
they're adding skins and useless ships, in a game where "dangerous" 0.0 got safer than highsec and where bots are the actual players.
---
I doubt it.  Maybe back when Eve still had an economist.  Multiple people have elaborated on how PLEX and injectors is a very destructive force on Eve's economy.  No one ever elaborates how they are healthy.
---
Whenever it contains any API, basic-advanced calculation or setting automatic timers you can use and realise it trough Shortcuts. Mostly.
---
Ah ok cool, i must have chose wrong when i played last, as i always joined ones where i had to be on multiple days a week and sign on at certain times.
---
My mistake, tbh i could swear that i adjusted orders that went to alpha.
---
So this. I spent 2 weeks in high sec doing missions. I was the man. I made my first million.. Dude I was rich. Millions in the bank a shitty fit(I did not know it was) punisher and I was rolling.
---
I do however feel that null should be something left for later... Karma, Horde, Brave are great but I feel they recruit the new players to early... its that get the number up guys mentality that kills it for new guys.
---
I have a lot of players in my corp from Brave, Karma and Horde who even though they have been in null for 2 years... still have never done exploration, missions, manufacturing or even learned the basics of PVP. It was CTA get in Eagle or what is required. Go here and press F1 and if not doing this grab your VNI and make Isk. That's scary that after 2 years that all they knew.
---
I never got money when I started and I'm super glad I didn't.
---
Every game I play, I love the beginning, when you're figuring stuff out, progress bit by bit, you can see the difference between the start and the end of a session, etc... The leveling during an ARPG, the start of Elite Dangerous, etc **That's why most people love ladder/season/league resets**.
---
I still remember when I got my first million ISK. And that was 11 years ago. I still remember buying my first catalyst and being in awe that I now had so many Hi's I could shoot AND salvage at the same time. I still remember my first Brutix and thinking I was the big league with a big ass ship now.
---
Everytime I get handed shortcuts in game, that's how I lose interest in a couple hours. Sure you have fun with what you've been given, but what now? You one-shot baddies, you don't take damage, you don't understand what's valuable, you feel like you can't do hard shit because you still don't know anything despite having 4 purples/20 mil ISK/4 legendaries/etc... So you just quit because w/e it feels like the game is over now.
---
Give them fitting loadouts, give them skillbooks: they'll know what to learn and they get money by not having to buy them, give them bookmarks of important places so that they can save them (even if it's just a bookmark of Jita IV-4, at least they'll have it saved somewhere). Let them engage with the game, don't spoil the amazing moment that is discovering a game's universe (literally) and mechanics, and what's it's capable of.
---
So in your mind, CCP making lazy decisions because they can't be bothered to devote actual time and effort to solving Eve's problems isn't a valid reason to vote with my wallet?
---
Shoot the haulers, kill the npc escalation i mean its free content.
---
Dont read any comments in here and continue with your journey... Cowboy the hell out of EVE..
---
People really need to stop thinking that CCP gives a flying fuck about botting. They are not stupid, if there is an issue that bothers them, they find solutions, if they don't find a solution to an issue, then it is because it doesn't bother them, it's simple.
---
When missions were full of bots, they blocked L4s to alpha accounts, when bots were running VNIs with alpha chars, they nerfed the VNI. Most bots are Omegas, I learned that from WERMT, and at the end of the day, an Omega bot means revenue for CCP.
---
we've got more skins
---
what's your point?
---
My corp dropped me about 50m in BPC after a few weeks and saw I actually do stuff.
---
I remember going there with one of our fleets because baddies were being bad (Goonswarm) and we were thanked for our service of defending the outpost and would be welcomed any time with the highest of respect.
---
pls dont shoot up any movie theaters when Joker comes out thx.
---
Hey at least they killed them. Fraternity has been trying to kill the Astra in their staging for months.
---
&gt;doesn't mean that CCP... know what they are doing.
---
You could have cut your post down to this and still conveyed the same amount of information.
---
everywhere. just check zkill.
---
I almost never give them isk and agree with your reasons. The best way to help new players is to play EVE with them just as you would with anyone else. I gank them, kill them, steal from them, hold them for ransom, etc. Never give anything back.
---
Some people might say that holding a 1 day old character in a Venture for a 50k isk ransom isn't worth it, but half the time that guy will reach out to you later on in their career to tell you that you are the reason they still play. Newbies aren't children and they don't need to be treated as if they are.
---
Your assumption that i was happy pre blackout is wrong. Just take a look at my posting history, heh.  
---
You are contradicting yourself. On the one hand you said that noone was willing to invest pre-BO, but then you also say that you see this game as a good investment opportunity.  
---
The video game market doesn't function the way you need it to to realize your vision.  
---
It is much easier to invest in a brand new game than taking the gamble of maybe being able to turn EVE around.  
---
I'd assume there are some really pissed off PA execs that wanted eve to be an easy, low-maintenamce cash cow for the next couple of years.  
---
I am not contradicting that a good chunk of the playerbase was against the change (although both our perceptions are warped here because we have different in-game bgs).  
---
What i am critical of is the reaction that the playerbase had to the change.    
---
From now on forward the gameplay will be catered extra hard towards sov-null groups, because ccp legit can't afford to lose this many players once again in this short timeframe.  
---
With the reaction of the playerbase being what it is, it has put ccp into a position where fixing the game is almost impossible.  
---
With any nerf that they apply to sov-null they now have to be fearful of unsubbing madness, because we as a playerbase have become too lethargic to embrace changes to the eve eco-system.  
---
This effectively puts an end to any hope of changes to umbrellas, super proliferation and the shit economic state the game is in.
---
I don't see how you can claim that ccp is intentionally fucking over eve players, when the wellbeing of their company depends on us.  
---
They might not have been very graceful (to be very flowery and nice about this) over the last 5 months (hell the last 5years even).  
---
But as soon as you are claiming that ccp is acting in bad faith, you also are saying that you should/will quit the game.  
---
There is no reason to stay onboard with a company that intends to fuck you.
---
god man ur one of those desillusional carbears sitting in his 0sec bubble, having 0 clue whats happening around him or what? ffs these are known bots man i even posted BANNED characters..as I was one of the people who constantly reported those dipshits when i lived in gotg space.
---
everybody knew those shtiheads are botting. everybody who needed proof, tested their behaviour themself, and not a single person didnt come to the conclusion that these are bots...hence they got banned.
---
ffs i know reddit is cancer.
---
but most awnsers here aretn cancerous, they are outright stooooopiiiiid and ignorat as fuck XD
---
if u guys are too fucking dumb to see a pattern in certain informations u can get by watching bots, checking their zkills and general behavior..then i cant help u either...
---
Ah, will do.
---
Fuck yes ! This is exactly how Eve really begin for me :)
---
Some dudes i've chat with were very nice, and can be good corpmates fore sure, but i've personaly always played in restrictive spoken-langage corps. Conversations was always short because my english bad
---
I love that... ransom a new guy.. ok i want 50k or i blow you up.. that experience will be with them for ever.
---
Dear Eve community,
---
Thanks for having an average age of \~30.
---
That is all.
---
Sure it is. Fundamentally i don't disagree. I just think eve players chose the wrong hill to die on.  
---
Where was the unsubbing outrage when skill injectors were introduced? Or when the economy of the game started going lopsided because the ressource system in null is fubar?  
---
No local/cyno changes is a fart in the wind compared to that, but it hit the players that apparently had forgotten what game they are playing and who it is that develops it.
---
Teaching them a valuable lesson. Adapt or die. Lol. Get fucked noobs. Hilmar sends his regards.
---
Its funny, you usually have to talk them through exactly how to send you money because they don't know how to do that yet.
---
TLDR: teach the man how to fish.
---
o7
---
Try in /r/eveJobs
---
That's where corps recruit!
---
They nerfed it too harshly. They could have kept blackout and restricted cynos to a wider selection of ships. I think they restricted its use too much.
---
Most officer mods get abyssled nowadays.
---
that character with all the industrial losses. he is just a fun find i saw in same area as some bots.
---
and i watched him hauling yesterday...that guy is either braindead or a bad scirpted bot..or would you haul in a t1 hauler in 0, jump gates , sit afk until cloak runs out...sit still for 15minutes ..then start aligning somewhere with half speed..and keep being aligned, half speed, for another 20 minutes.....in 0sec....in non friendly space...
---
bitch please...
---
That helps for sure 😄
---
Well those do exist already - as anomalies
---
And, not to forget every other mining missions spawns a pocket with ores for the player.
---
where is CCP memeq?
---
Missions spawn pockets to mine, when was the last time you started a new char?
---
meanwhile you hitting d-scan hoping you dont get blown up yourself... shittttt
---
It do.
---
&gt;No local/cyno changes
---
See that's the thing no one seems to get, we aren't dying on the hill of no local/cyno changes, we are dying on the hill of "Is this really the best they can do? And why can't they put any time and money into solving the very real issues within the game?" There was a multitude of issues they could have worked on, Injectors, the entirety of faction warfare for example, or the myriad of issues with citadels, hell even Fozzie Sov being a flaming pile of dog shit. Any of these things being changed would have been welcomed and cheered by the community, instead they chose to fuck with the two things most likely to result in overwhelming backlash.
---
Not sure what kind of playstyle you are aiming for, but A Band Apart (my alliance) is a really laid back group, with no activity requirements whatsoever.
---
haha i love that.. honestly its what you made of the game. the game does not make you. its what you do that makes the game and Eve is the only game where I find this is possible from a open world sanbox point of view.
---
We seem to just want new players to get good quick when in fact they crap for a reason.. They having fun and not giving a shit
---
This technique works because as the battleships spawn they burn straight away, allowing you to hit them with capital guns. Missiles don't benefit from transversal in the same way and won't work as well.
---
dude. ok so a guy loses 20 bil in asteros, with drones inside...to single rocket bombers..never even deploys a drone...right makes sense.
---
also i watch explo bots for about 18months now.
---
they all act pretty much the same.
---
the proof you want is: wtach them, follow them, try to catcht hem for over a year..and you will see all patterns..
---
also if i convo about 80 ish, of those astero dudes, constantly ( incl pms) and never get even a " hi" or any awnser at all ( i used different toons too)..thats kinda weird too, for real players...
---
also theres an older reddit post, dude even found the guy who the bots (in gotg space backt hen), contract all the loot to. he made an elaborate post about it, including contratc histories, characters used..and so on.
---
im so sick of people be like " but i see no proof"..FFS thats the main part of botting...they dont waer a blinky sign saying " hi im a bot"..you need to check that shit for yourself, then u get your proof.
---
this ignorance in eve is disgusting...
---
Someone buying the company means it was probably a good investment. 
---
Which was my main concern with all of this. I knew the BO would cost pretty much every ounce of goodwill CCP had to pull off which would make other better changes get fked due to the playerbase not wanting any more changes. But I thought they were gonna iterate on it fast, instead they doubled down. I was hoping for more.
---
I even wrote Falcon literally saying this. 
---
Im not saying CCP is acting in bad faith, Im saying choosing the worst options for changes simply because of age of chaos is punitive. When they themselves admit to having options but specifically going the worst route for a buzzword moment, thats punitive. They overestimated themselves by a lot and thought they could get away with it. Hubris caused this.
---
And while I kept playing through the BO and still am, I lost a lot of hope in the game. Not because I think CCP want to burn the game but rather I dont think they can fix the issues anymore. For whatever reason. And I think they are stuck in this "hate blocs" attitude like this sub whilst ignoring the fact that perhaps a majority or atleast a very large minority are currently living in them.
---
You cant fk over that large of a playerbase and remain unscathed. And you should never ever consider doing it. CCP as a company should never have chosen a side. 
---
Its very simple mate, they fucked up. They are not the first company to do so and they wont be the last. And it was clear how this was gonna go. There were no alternatives, you get that right? Like there wasnt any other way. That was my problem with all of this, no leeway. Just black or white. And it was never gonna be one of them.
---
&gt; That's why most people love ladder/season/league resets.
---
I do love the beginnings, but league resets etc. do nothing to me to bring back the feel of first start in a game.
---
nope. they all act the same way. watching the astero menace for over 18 months now, in all areas of 0sec.
---
those dudes dont forget ecm drones, as they simply never use drones anyway, even they have 3 sets in bay..never deploy on aggression, hell u could kill them in an ibis, if you could catch them in one.
---
True for the learning aspect, but seeing your character progress, growing and a build coming together is very satisfying. Kinda like the first time you're able to fly a Cruiser when coming from a frigate and you shit on the mission you previously needed to take very cautiously.
---
yeah right, and thats why some people create ( or activate bought toons) right around the same time of a months..and multibox them all across new edens 0sec  simultaneously..and never even fight back a single rocket manticore...which even a carebear probably would at least try after astero loss number 20 in a row...
---
( like 3 sets of drone in bay..never even deployed a single one to fight of a single bomber)
---
cmon.
---
how blind to things can people be...its a mystery to me.
---
i watch those dipshits for 18months now....
---
I've always thought tether was waaaaay too strong, and this is a good idea. Low power really needs to mean something more than it does now. 
---
Personally I'd go further and make it so that if your ship is able to dock in a structure (regardless of it's power state), then no tether.
---
Dude, I die a lot. I am not a good player but if you've ever flown an Astero you should know how agile and fast they are. To get caught by a single sabre when you're in an Astery you'd have to be beyond bad. I've died in an Astero once (and it's probably the ship I use the most) and that was because I forgot I was in null and warped directly to the gate, getting caught up in a bubble at the same time as another ship that decloaked me.
---
If you REALLY want the purge.... uninstall.
---
I cannot thank you enough
---
wow thank you!
---
Oh really? How many fleets of sub-capitals, how many capitals, how many rorquals died in high sec this week compared to null? Oh.. none? Hrm, ok.
---
When i make a ship and fly it in omega with omega modules, let the account go alpha again, if i stay in space and dont dock, will the omega modules (covops cloak for example) go offline? Or can i keep using it as alpha as long as i dont dock?
---
Was in an alliance brawl gang, some dipshit takes his pve fit (and badly fit) navy raven into lowsec and eats shit. Corp members are harvesting salt from the poor shitter who clearly doesn't get that where we are is not the place to do... whatever he was doing. So I pulled him into a conversation and told him not to take things into lowsec unless he intends for them to die, threw him isk worth slightly more than his ship and left him before he had a chance to respond.
---
XD oh man.
---
i dont know where to start ..and i guess explaining it would take me some serious time . and i would have to write a wall of text..so even a spodbrain like you could make sense of it.
---
tons of people will tell you, that these astero people , indeed are bots. as tons of people are annoyed by them, hell some people even make spreadsheets to keep track of the known explo bots in their area..thing is most of 0sec carebears cant be arsed to catch those dudes frequently...because cloaky camping relics and pipes...doesnt generate dank ticks...
---
and people know thta, so they just send in the swarm of explo bots...and let them run the same regions in circles every fucking day of the week aroudn the same timezones..as they hardly lose 1 per day or week or soem even only per month...cuz hard to catch, effort and time needed to catch in first place..and effort and time is better invested into dank ticks...
---
also theres a lot of dumb rules ( depending on which corp/allaince) like " dont bubble camp pipe xyz..in homespace...dont do this, dont do that...makes it incredibly more difficult to do shit abut those bots.
---
as its hard to get them in relic sites..u catch them once, afterwards they ignore any relic site in system, when theres people in system who ever agressed on them before..( you know reading combat logs, lossmails, and whatnot..yes scripts can do that...oh what a surprise)
---
i am so sick of this ignorance eve 0 bears display when it comes to those explo bots..as this is by far not the only thread/post you will find googling...and literally in every single post you see people be like " muh..that probably dedicated explo alts..." and dumbshit like that...NO ffs.
---
its not difficult at all. it is actually fairly easy as of my understanding. 
---
scanning is one of the easiest and most logical things in eve. perfectly scriptable.
---
this one trick ccp doesn't want you to know about
---
Do the packs work on a non-steam eve version?
---
Don't agree with this whatsoever to be honest. We also run a huge newbro corp, and from my experience, the more you hold peoples hand, the more chance there is that they never become truly independent and you have to guide them through their entire eve carreer simply bc they got used to your help and rely on it. You really should NOT be there to hold their hand. Eve doesn't either, and the faster they learn that (and learn to be independent) the better.
---
Yes it will go offline
---
once u agressed on 1 bot who shares obviously the same owner as the other bots in same region they will ignore any relic site with u in system, so u can sit ur arse off in a site, see them probing it..and never land in it.
---
( script either able to read combat log, which most scripts probably do anyways, hell they can read local..so they can logs too, or in case u managed to kill a bot, lossmails/combatlog script reading)
---
so basically you burn one of your toons per botkill , if you use the relic campy method. ( thats at least for 75% of those bot asteros, some arent that sophisticated, and u can catche them a couple of times in a row, before they also act the same way)
---
i watch this shit for about 18months now. i tested all kinds of shenannigans in a lot of areas in eve, from north to south, east to west , 0sec.
---
i dont let people tell me shit about it , like " thats dedicated explo alts" ..or " prolly anti pvp carebears" and all kinds of ignorat dumb replies of people who obviously cant be arsed to check shit for themself, and accuse you of being outrageous and making things up.
---
makes me sick.
---
No we in PEKA understand these struggles but you can still play other games ect hell we have a guy who threatens to log in (via whatsapp) but yeah your life is your life, were here to make your eve life less painful
---
CCP Plant and CCP Couch ... don't forget
---
TL;DR 
---
Give a man a fish and he'll eat for a day, teach him to fish and he'll eat for a lifetime
---
MORE LIKE: which would be exactly like " bots in same area, share same owner" hence most bots start their activity ( according to zkill) at around the same time..and..oh wonder..get banned around the same time periods ( check the linked banned ones..all end of april within 3-4 days)
---
so yes its real players using those bots. what a miracel.
---
its not like bots using bots to bot...
---
also they die in similar situations, because thats on of the few  ways to catch them at all..and yes they dont die costantly..because people cant be arsed to sit in same pocket for 6 hours a day to wait for that bot to return every 2-3 hours..and since vast areas of 0sec are dead empty...they can roam for a month without getting caught....
---
i dont even know why i have to explain that. as its quite obvious logic.
---
wormholer?
---
no idea what this reply has to do with the initial post. but to awnser your ironic comment : no. they arent, indeed.
---
adding to the other reply, can you explain to me this monstrosity
---
&gt; Just because CCP has been working on this game for closing in on 2 decades and just because all the cyno change did was change a 1 to a zero in the code of most ships doesnt mean that
---
Can you re-post this, my Illiterate -&gt; Literate google setting isn't working.
---
That is legit the most overused timer for weekly returning fleets there is. Not sure if that really is a good time-slot
---
I start the convo first.  Make sure they know about safe spots, bookmarking the exit, etc.  How to judge hole safety.  dscan and zkill
---
If they're not a dick, I comp their loss, or twice, and tell them one good relic site will buy them 20 ships, so who cares?
---
I have tried that but eve is a game i love to hate to love
---
The other side of the babadook meme was when Netflix accidentally categorized it as an LGBT movie, and people decided the babadook was some sort of LGBT icon. Pretty funny.

Cheers guys, i like a varied approach tbh but i mainly liked the mining and resoucre management stuff (planet interactions). Although combat helps to break up the monotamy of mining haha
---
Need to log in for this first time in a while and see where im at.
---
Last new guy I met in Nullsec got a golden shower, 13 Billion isk in his first month on his first fleet. was that bad?
---
Try a corp that doesn't actually use their newbros as cannonfodder(oh, and can't shoort 75% of New Eden bc blue donut)! Get's even more fun then
---
no.
---
It was a joke. I didn't think you actually could do any better.
---
Explosion velocity and explosion radius get exponentially more important the bigger the launchers and the smaller the ship you are trying to hit. 5% in each can give you a 50+% application to small ships on e.g. a Heavy Assault Launchers
---
Stupid highsec bots and krabs with their marauder umbrellas.
---
If they bother to scan down the site at all, it’s just a person who’s smart enough to look up your character on zkill and realize you hunt explorers. Bots can just check local for blacklisted names and move on without scanning at all
---
Hoboleaks has both a npc test dread and player dread with trig stats so thats a thing
---
To be honest, I check here daily to make sure CCP didn't give me an "awesome" update.
---
Literally trig supremacy
---
Hoboleaks has both a npc test dread and player test dread with trig stats so thats a thing
---
At least half of the links are normal krabs that have j-space losses in cheap shit, gilas and other crap. Not to say all of those are real people but some definitely are. 
---
And yes, people do panic and can't even defend themselves even if they try to prepare (based on the advice of their peers). That's not even counting pacifists.
---
yeah they only scan holes...
---
dude.
---
i dont even know what to reply to this..
---
some people cant be helped.
---
It’s ok if I am , I just need to get better
---
No one should ever hold their hand all the way. You should see yourself as a veteran. A veteran that introduces himself to the player and explains that if the player has any questions to please ask. that's it. You don't need to do anything more than this. If the player asks for advise then give advise. If they struggling with missions... then simply have a look at their fits and again give advise by working through the fit and advise with them so they learn but dont force advise down on them. That's when they get used to always coming to you...
---
"I dont have to think for myself because AnotherEveRedditAlt will help me."
---
Again its about being there when they need it and ask for it not forced onto them.
---
Nah.
---
Thanks, when he said 1.5 align I was pretty sure that if they were going that 4K I saw and even if my decloak heavy bubble still worked it would still be rough to put the fork in him
---
I'll add that pulling newbros into Null where they can salvage 100m an hour on their first day makes everything else in the game seem pointless. There is a lot to do and learn in lowsec and to a lesser degree highsec. If you start off having your hand held in null and never learning about survival and manual piloting and the like that you learn living in lowsec. It is a disservice to newbros.
---
If there’s one group Init hates more than Panfam, it’s Test. Just because you’re all goon pets doesn’t mean you all get along
---
Can orcas tank them?
---
Maybe they dont, for player retention. A successful method for F2P games is to constantly add new ships and interesting things to acquire. Could be everything from new null space to ships, actual content, not skins,
---
Same with the Drakhor Corporation, very laid back as with most corporations tbh.
---
Scan down relic site, burn a ping 150+ k from the cans, cloak there. Wait for astero to start hacking and then warp to can at 0 and poop bubble while you run them down. You'll catch at least 50% of them. They have to be able to cloak and mwd/align out before you lock them and that means they have 3-5 seconds to react while they are hacking a can.
---
Disable Java (add on like No script)
---
Sent Squizz a ping first thing when it started..

If it's just the scout ships, I've killed them with my orca fine, up to five of the scout frigs.
---
See we in ART5 take the view that if you want to come to EVE and buy plex and go buy a 800 million ship at 10 days old because you injected into the game.. fly it into low sec and die... that's on you.
---
These people want to pay to win. They want to get good quick and so they die fast. We cant change that mentality and so we dont really cater for it. We allow them into corp and then they die and then they leave.
---
Now if the player was a player who saved for 1 year to buy that ship and go into low sec with it and die because you where going into low sec to PVP and he only had that.. its the FC's fault.. It sure as hell is not that pilots fault but the FC is sure to be blamed here. I don't care if you have 15 years under your belt doing industrial and missions. If you dont have any PVP skills in my fleets, you start you guessed it with a frigate.
---
This IMHO. 
---
Players are more likely to leave after you rip them a new one without telling them why or how 
---
Yes the isk is secondary to the why part but it's the least we can do. It's not like giving a new bro a billion and walking away. Anything less than 50 gives them a good starting platform. IMHO they game should give them a bit to start with but I see where that gets Harry for vets.
---
And giving them isk gives them a sense that not EVERYONE is out to get you. Also I agree with the phrase the op sums up to. Teach a man to fish and he will eat for a life time.. only issue here is teaching a newbro to fish is harder than killing them telling them why, paying for their loss and moving on like most of us I suspect do.
---
I mean I don't just scan holes. I do relic sites and scan wormholes with mine. If killboard is all you base this on then you're stupid and paranoid.
---
If you think they're bots, go ahead, report them. But all you did with this post is show how small minded you are. I don't know the statistics but presumable the majority of players are in highsec and exploration is one of the best ways to make money if you live in highsec.

for example behaves exactly how I behaved in my first weeks when I startet to play eve. being stupid, die to stupid stuff etc. (and the playing/dying times also looks normal for an unemployed person, like I was when I started)
---
You seen him online again?

Is CCP ever going to nerf the bastion model!? Literally what's killing Eve!
---
"Gib data, no you cant know why, its big secret"
---
Honestly No idea forgot his name. And well it was like the goon golden shower where everyone in the fleet gives you money.
---
This so much. Actually high sec content is not bad but yes Brave, Karma and Horde are great when you hear about them as this new player friendly Alliances that teach people the game but they not great at all and really strip the new player experience out of the game instantly.
---
Welcome to the game. so we have really scary place called null sec.... yeah come there first and get in a ship and press F1.
---
No one cares
---
"Better than faction and/or deadspace" is all that they need to be to be insanely valuable. 1.3% bonus to some modules increases the price from 100 mil, to 9 billion. Alliance tournemant folks be crazy
---
90% yes. Not being able to light on a dictor hull is cancer though.
---
Ive flown a fuckload of astero's in null, never been deterred by a bubble ever. Even with decloakers on grid. Astero is a monster ship.
---
His point is he needs to plug his sig so he can feel relevant... can’t really expect much more from a dino brain
---
Ask your carer for help on the big words she'll explain it to you.
---
is he some sort of leadership or FC in that SIG or just a rando?
---
what if I tell you that Goon logo resembles the bee ?
---
I think they changed the PI one. I recently had a number of accounts go alpha and when I went to restart timers to check, they were all at zero days max pull. It wouldn't let me change pull time/amount.
---
There is actually quite the strong and vibrant RP community in Eve.
---
Check out the Roleplay is Primary discord server if you are interested in Roleplaying in Eve
---
you cant pull L5s if you go under 7.0 Faction Standing but you also lose access to an individual agent if you go under -2.0 to that agent by declining too many missions.
---
You should make Zelensky the PVE-ers
---
Yeah haha I kill rorquals everyday in highsec bro. It's so fucking dangerous you wouldn't even go there if you didn't safely farm wormholes all day
---
Trying to catch them on gate seems a lot harder with a saber and decloak, I feel like they are more slippery than even tengu hunters were back in the day
---
Now you have me trying to figure out how to min/max a pi farm
---
Assuming just a rando that wants to brag about predds undock astra... but it’s dumb because test has a super fleet that’s bigger than wintercos nearby and is no way as impressive as this astra doing this much work
---
That was my plan
---
okey, lets say you witnessed that by watching them. How exactly should CCP find this "obvious" behaviour? Logs don't really help them, as they look like normal players (maybe stupid once, but new players are always stupid)...
---
A second, quite important part is: shitbots won't have priority for CCP. Bots become a problem when their number/impact is large enough to disrupt the economy. Bots running in circles, are not quite disrupting the economy...
---
Subcap content is pretty boring now knowing there's no capital escalations coming because any recon is instantly primaried and annihilated the second the dedicated recon spotter calls it.
---
Yeah, boring.
---
Thanks for inviting us out, we got to test out a bunch of stuff in USTZ that we haven't had the chance to test before now due to USTZ fights being a little rare on this front. I look forward to working with you guys more in the future

The better part of a decade of steadily declining player numbers would demonstrate that that strategy is not the best.

On a tangent but related issue, I've noticed that over the last 10 years or so the taboo against capping children in films and on television has completely gone.  It used to be one of the rules of the screen that you don't show a nutter burying an axe into the head of a child but these days apparently anything goes.
---
Being somewhat old fashioned I still find it shocking.

When is CCP going to make an update lmbo
---
I may do this. I need to pick a system and price out injectors.
---
Must have been on my end, strange. Thanks.
---
Camp the sites my dude. Far more effective. Unironically can use a bomber with small guns instead of torps as tackle if you want to multibox
---
i ended up selling my 2 10bill webs for slightly longer range, slightly stronger web strength 4bill abyssal webs.
---
and regarding your AT note, web bonused ships get 40km with say a t2 web, 60km with faction, 90-100km with officer/abyssal.....those small differences make a huge difference.
---
and if you can web further than smoone else, you can hold them back.
---
wtf are you on about
---
It is a shit idea as you proposed it, but imo some purge-like event where you simply disable concord for a weekend or something wouldn't be that bad. Hell, you could even add some RP flavour to it by having concord going on strike for the increased workload because of triglavians or something. 
---
Also never not upvote purge references.
---
That was indeed us. Goons ended up no showing however amusingly shortly after the PanFam fleet left Shoot First dropped a small rattlesnake fleet on us. It was swiftly dismantled.
---
incels like u were threatening to shoot up movie theaters playing Joker. im asking u not to, I just wanna enjoy the movie, thx in advance.
---
They had to add new fields.  Other wise cyno would of just been turned off.  And don't forget the new line in the database.

But there is absence of work.
---
I still remember , after so many years that i was about to quit but a meta gun dropped from a belt rat worth as much as destroyer hull!   
---
Man i was excited i moved it to jita, sold it and got myself a destroyer hull that i equipped with civilian guns!     
---
I still remember that i was letting NPC on belt kill me so i can pull additional civilian gun from the wreck !              
---
(yes i didn't know then you get free noobship on each station and that you can just repackage/assemble one to have new civilian stuff)
---
If I ever find a newbro I would do the following:
---
 dont kill the pod but hold them ransom, where the ransom is talking about how they got killed. if they learn they get SRP with a small bonus
---
How the fuck am i an incel because i remember the history of mintchip in eve online you mongoloid.
---
i was in alliance with u. ur an incel.
---
I used to think this but then had the actual mechanics explained. It is more CCP's poor ui setup than anything else to blame. Undocking before joining fleet saves you a session timer but if the fleet invite arrives at the same time you attempt to join actual fleet there is very little warning that the accept button sends you into hostile fleet instead of the one you accepted.
---
It is still a dumb way to die, bit not that dumb.
---
You also cant exempt from fleet warp till your already in the fleet.
---
shocker, I never noticed that. Also, now that I think of this, I just noticed that TEST logo kind of resembles a dinosaur?
---
Hopefully not. Just the asteroid belts, not the anomalies or moons
---
I want to say it's cause of school shootings but that's just me trying to stir shit.

I'm not an RPer, but would do my best to accommodate your RP.
---
When I was a new player someone gave me a billion isk so I started a Corp and was gonna be a merc. I made friends and recruited people. I paid for all their shit when we would roam and lose it. I became really good friends with one of the guys and even made him a director. I put all my isk in a Corp wallet so we could both use it to help our growing corp. I had to go away for a week and left thencorp in his capable hands. He cleaned out the Corp wallet and hangers. Stole everything and kicked all our members. I've never given director role to anyone who I cant go punch in the face irl since.
---
Pay SUAS to make you one :D
---
and? still not an incel.
---
oh okay
---
I do the same. If I kill someone and see the clone is new I'll shoot them the zkill worth for the ship, and tell them how they can avoid it next time.

I've played eve off and on over the last few years. I never really enjoyed the corps I was in as it felt mindless and I didn't learn a lot. I ended up in wormholes flying solo and got bored.

Some hand-holding would go a long way for player retention. PC gamers are in short supply of that these days.
---
Hmm, ill see if I can find someone in EU to ship this to, then ship over to the states. I used to run a tournament of this at my meetup every year, but slowly ran out of cheap/accessible cards to provide as this stuff got rarer/more expensive.

... and that's why we have r/Eve.
---
Per account :      
---
1. 500 plex        
---
2. 2 injectors (1 injector per char to get skills to lvl 4)         
---
3. 1mil sp from buddy.             
---
You get a buddy, drop 1mil sp into a single char ^(you cannot do it in any other way) do PI for lvl 4 skills, make chars drop 1 injector on them.       
---
Now you have also 30days to polish your skills more.

Well if you back playing. Give ART5 a look
---
    have agent, corp and faction over -2.0
---
    
---
    and
---
    have at least one of the three above 7.0
---
and you definitely will
---
Bluebeard is that you...
---
I regularly check the Eve Launcher, only to be greeted by: "GET YOUR PLEX", "NEW *RANDOM* SKIN", "THE *RANDOM* INVASION", and "THE SCOPE" (all in caps). No charity events, no alliance tournament, no community live streams, nothing since the community team consists of CCP\_Falcon and his collection of selfie videos....
---
Then I open the Eve Online web portal to find out that you can now play Eve "FOR FREE" or "PLAY PREMIUM" - I guess the 2018 joke from my subreddit flair is on me now...
---
Any news on the updates page? - "We are super happy to announce ... ", guess not then.
---
Eve Online is in ~~milking~~  maintenance mode and will be until its end. Its core gaming community is getting older and has moved on to more dynamic/casual game styles. The investment dilemma (time, skill points, assets, territory, etc.) is not working anymore as a motivator to continue subscriptions since the introduction of skill injectors and the free-to-play model. And since players are leaving the game in bunches, there is hardly anybody to find to experience the "good times". But hey, at least you can look pretty in your golden SKIN.
---
Type that's what I needed.  Thought it was -1.5 for agent.
---
minimum standings to be able to pull a level 5 mission:
---
    faction, corp and agent at least -2.0
---
    at least one of them at least 7.0
---
You need alt to move it, it need to have recon skilled.       
---
After the cyno changes it is cheaper to insure and self destruct carrier rather lose a recon in the process during longer move.             
---
Carrier go poof to bomber fleet below 1minute, to any bigger gang in &lt;3minutes, insta die to DD and 1 salvo from titan.               
---
Unless it is fully brick dual tank ... but you don't want to do it.
---
You cant predict that it can go very many ways.
---
I'm not currently, but if I can convince a friend or two to join me then I'll give it a shot. Sometimes I worry people will think I'm a spy alt because I've mostly trained stealth and other wormhole skills and not much of a kill board.
---
No. You might be able to share the actual character profile. I dont know got sure of this will do what you are looking for.
---
Wrong format dude, get your memes right scrub.
---
How many characters you've got in invention/production? I've got two full time toons, but I find I'm limited by the speed with which I'm able to sell. Well, I could sell to buy orders, but then would need to train more toons.
---
The joke in ART5 is that all 600+ people are actually my alts and spies. Im actaully the only spy but still the CEO.. we dont really care about spies and alts
---
Low sec? Low sec is snuff. Autistic players who can stomach grinding isk for months and years to skill inject a titan to every player and multiple dread alts. They crush anyone trying to grow in lowsec. Thank shadow cartel for during, thank pandemic legion moving to null, thank bitter hatred between the leaders of small lowsec groups that will never work together. The blame for low sec being trash rests on players.

well i did and she is now hospitalized for excessive bleeding in the eyes

You gotta remember the main difference between you and the CCP Security Team or their boss. You have a brain capable of critical thinking while CCP's Security Team does not have the ability to critically think for themselves.

If you follow these steps, I believe you'll get what you want. Basically, once you identify which files corresponds to the user/character file you want to copy, you just paste over the rest of the user/character files with it.

Don't even bother. You will just be feeding a recon everytime you jump it. Unless you have several alts available just fly something t1 and cheap. Caracals are great for cost effective in this atmosphere.

One of them has all it's losses within 2 hours of 1500 and 0800. Similar to a person that has 2 play session period when they are able to play.
---
Again, the point is to compare the difference in price, you absolute buffoon. If it isn't more expensive in WHs, it isn't more profitable in WHs. Use your brain for half a second.

Good way to farm standings anyone? The ole soe arcs doesn't share via fleet from what I've seen
---
Hmm good point about sleeper relic/data sites I normally don't bother with those because I'm lazy. I might have to try w/ praxis just to see if it can do it.
---
was this only known to you?
---
That's not all they did. They had to pick which ships would get a 1 and a 0 as well as actually add it
---
ISK sinks: okay I guess, just needs good design (lol).
---
removal of excavators: I don't think more nerfs to rorqs will balance the ship. The rorq is fine right now as fielding one or more puts them at risk because of cyno nerfs. this one is a no in my book.
---
adjustment to capital ratting: who even rats in capitals anymore? again, cyno changes. another no.
---
nerf to blue loot: hmmm no.
---
Also hey, you seem to have dropped this "citadel rebalance/nerf" and "sov rework".
---
If you have ISK to spare, fit it like a solo battleship (lots of tackle, active rep, neuts) and you'll get to enjoy that a bit. Until someone brings another capital or more than 10 bombers, that is. Getting the carrier fit is a big challenge as you can't easily buy and fit one in any lowsec station (and if you can then it's likely that you'll be seen undocking).
---
yea i was that new player our corp owner and our mining director are giving help and our mining director always got fitted ventures etc for the new players to explore mining and explaines it... that lad is a help to miners like me
---
None of these are mine but yea I'm going to put them in a solo corp or NPC corp. I'm also not going to answer to anyone who PMs me and yea if I get tackled by someone, I'm dead and just move on with my day.   
---
But the short answer is I don't care. Bots are CCPs job, not mine, not yours. If you want to spend your time finding bots and reporting them to CCP, have fun. But the hundreds of BJs you thought you would get here likely won't be coming (ha ha!)
---
Damage con rolls only change the resist of your hull.   So kinda a waste.  You can get the most amazing roll, and itl only add like 300ehp.
---
Very sorry for your loss. It sounds like you were an amazing grandson, including  your grandfather in your daily activities and letting him see the world through your younger eyes. Even if he didn’t understand all things Eve ( who does) I’m sure he loved to see your joy and maybe occasional salt while you played the game. 
---
I lost my grandparents long ago but I volunteer at a local veterans home in my spare time, so many of them are forgotten and like your grandfather, they just want to feel included. In our fast paced lives we sometimes lose sight of the needs of those around us. It sounds like you never did, you gave your grandfather a really nice time until the very end. That says a lot about who you are. Carry that with pride for the rest of your life.
---
Again, so sorry for your loss.
---
That was warmup
---
There are for sure alternative fits that work just fine as well. This one has my preference, as with a 3rd quad you're not going to be faster than 3 cycles in a vanilla.

In a lowsec system (or any system if it doesn't matter) how long do anoms last after they've been visited and mined? How about if no one ever warps to it?
---
Had a Large Gneiss deposit spawn and I'm curious on the mechanics surrounding its despawning.
---
alliance wide undock bans? Ok. So what? Who are they gonna punish? John doe on the top of the local list? How about that john doe who undoxxed his carrier from the fortizar? Yhea! punish that person! If logs are disabled, how are they gonna know? Manually comb through every single members inventory list from before the mighty purge and compare it to the after? Under pay somebody to automate it?

Removing concord one day a year would be cool :D

That's what happened to me. Got killed in a WH exploring in my Heron, got ~20m isk. Wow that's way more than what I looted! Was a good day. Now 20m is nothing, so its something I keep in mind if I'm going to cap someone new in a WH.

E-Uni is a good choice.  I'd recommend checking the size of the group you're contemplating joining.  If you really don't want to get personally involved with anyone, large groups are better.  If you want to make friends, a smaller group will serve you better.  Generally, I think a small group that accomodates newbros is your best choice, but that's because I think flying with people you've gotten to know is more engaging, and more fun.
---
I'm sure others have pointed this out to you already, but I CBA reading this terrible thread. In short: loss only kb links don't prove shit, game is full of people who only pve / live in hisec and only dwell lowsec and nullsec for exploration / krab only alts of pvp players that don't have the relevant skills to fight. I'm not saying they're not bots, mind you,but you did not prove it at all.
---
I always liked to make "ship in a box" kits which consisted of a small cargo can filled with a collection of BPCs enough to make a complete, easy-to-fit PVE fitting for a tech 1 cruiser and hand those out to rookies.  
---
It taught them about how to fit ships, how to use industry to build stuff, how to use market to buy the materials and also how to work out that simply buying the modules is sometimes cheaper than buying the materials and building the fit themselves.  
---
We'd then run L4 missions in kitchen sink fleets of frigates, destroyers and the odd cruiser here or there, myself keeping them alive in a Scimitar or Oneiros, sometimes showing off in an Eos or Sleipnir to give an example of command bursts. Loot worth over a certain amount was shared out evenly, everything under that amount was melted down and minerals divided up evenly to aid in building the BPC ships.  
---
Worked rather well.
---
You can eve kill most asteros except for bling fit pvp asteros with small gun bombers. Nothing says I love you like 180-200dps on the astero.
---
I see no problem. I'll say what I want. Period

---

---
yep covops frigates and prospects should lose covert cyno. too
---
“Teach a man to fish...”
---
&gt;  After the cyno changes it is cheaper to insure and self destruct carrier rather lose a recon in the process during longer move.             
---
Yeah, this is a good and normal thing, thanks CCP...
---
The PvE available in null is so unengaging, it may very well not have been a bot.
---
I maintain that such is one of the main causes of most complaints with the game currently.
---
waiting for cyno revert, nothing else.
---
I currently play but I scan this sub pretty regularly for the news. It's not just a meme that the attitude on the sub is toxic and rarely aligns with my in game experience. There's lots of room for improvement in the game and sometimes you see solid arguments put forth here, but damn I hope that one day the age of "use maximum hyperbole to make my argument sound more convincing" will pass.
---
I'd fall off my chair and spill all my coffee over me and my computer if I ever saw "EvE 2.0" announced.
---
SO not sure if you have heard of this corp called ART5.. hehe you always welcome. we actually in the process of starting something like this for our indy people called mine a procurer and also mine a orca program. We will then move to PVE and PVP ships
---
Paging u/mrwoodensolid
---
It's not specifically any individual act they did. It's the existence of wormholes in general that are the problem, and the type of player in engenders, and the incredibly vocal desire for all things to become wormhole. 
---
Wormholes are extension and means of navigation that reduces the distance. Distance is a existential problem in EvE. Vis a vis wormholes are a problem.
---
Wormholes when introduced lead to the cutting of the player population by a third.
---
Any player that has to autistically hunt holes, camp entrances and roll constantly while pinging dscan is mentally insane. My interactions with WHOTs lead me to believe most cannot be trusted with any amount of responsibility or faith within your corp. Betrayal, and general asswormholely seems to weed them out faster than most players.
---
The continued campaign and the seemingly lack of regret to the state of EvE they have indirectly, or in my opinion directly caused is their fault. Null sec should not be Worm-sec. Just as Lowsec should not be highsec.

Ok thanks! That makes sense.
---
I'm just waiting for that one skin, I just KNOW the perfect skin for my ships will be made soon! Until then, I only login 10 minutes a day...
---
That gives the astero a few seconds to crash back to the gate, and unless he’s very dumb he will make it. Then it will just crash back again and be prepared for the bubble. 
---
It has more of a chance of working than just bubbling as soon as they jump, but it’s still not a very good chance
---
A super kitey nano Nidhoggur with local reps can work. Kind of. But it's still going to get caught and if you get caught by 4-5 people able to hold your fighters/kill your fighters/jam your fighters - you will die.
---
A long time in USTZ. EVE is so empty now........
---
Nice try, but that was just you feeling offended because you considered yourself included in my comment out of your own volition and reacted like a salty little fuck.
---
But hey, free salt fron butthurt capsuleers is always appreciated, so thanks buddy.
---
I heard that they nerfed how many there are and it has become super limited
---
Don’t you think a player is more likely to panic and forget to deploy drones than a bot is?
---
I was one of those newbros given ISK.(I was and still am an Alpha). That soon taught me that no, Mining was not the most fun nor profitable way to make ISK. Same with low level missions- I finished the tutorial missions to learn the basics, and then I occasionally do other missions to level up my standings
---
I ended up losing a decent amount to trying to learn PvP, and, thankfully, I knew not to blow everything on an expensive fit, I managed to learn... kinda... I still die most of the time, but I at least put up a fight; I now run combat sites/DED complexes, along with doing some industrial stuff on the side; and of course, my most profitable venture- nullsec complexes
---
RIP my Navy Vexor tho; got jumped while in lowsec
---
tbh the thing I hate most about getting blown up in nullsec is that it takes a while to get back there to the relic site
---
I wish Alphas could mount prototype cloaks tho
---
love this
---
These are the REAL little guys right here.
---
Mmmmmuh internet space pixulz
---
The astero can crash back to the gate anyway?
---
For the unaware, a delay bubble is when you wait to drop the bubble until you see the cloaking ship decloak. Many people will see there is no bubble and try to simply warp+cloak. When the bubble lands, their warp is canceled, and they slow to a stop for several seconds becoming an easy decloak.
---
It's really no harder to escape from than a pre-bubbled gate, but people react differently when there is no bubble.
---
do you need any implants in particular ?
---
I hope that you find a solid corporation. There are many corporation that accept casual, 2 days a week active, pilots.
---
The biggest.  Really the best ever.  Every fanfest they make amazing claims.  I'd like to see a graph charting promises made to promises delivered.  I'll only believe it when I see it now.
---
haha, nice one! a super kitey nano Nidhoggur vs bomber fleet .. o7
---
ATM I have 9 toons omega, with skilling active. They don't have the 10 production lines each, I think 3 still have still only 5. which means, 6*10+3*5 = 75 lines.
---
I sometimes need more, but often need less. Most of the time, I have +-30 production jobs. right now I have 5 remaining lines, but that's because I purchased a lot of 10/20  bpos.
---
all my toons have at least advanced research lab IV, I think half have V, and all the science skills for reseach and prod of T1 stuff (eg outpost construction I, capital ship construction III .
---
Here the little trick is "how many items do I produce", which should be limited by the volume you expect to sell - and "how do I select my production". A little bit of analysis skills are required for both.
---
Fitting armor buffer takes away damage slots, slows down your speed and agility. Plus locally repped armor sucks donkey balls. Taking about twice the capacitor and basically all your PG to reach the same EHP/s as a local shield tank. 
---
But its ok tho it's perfectly balanced because shield tank is faster, reps better, reps land easier, they do more damage and all because armor gets better tackle cus free mids.
---
Both good and bad.
---
I worked at a near-minimum wage job while multiboxing enough to make ~1.5b/hr.

Can not confirm this post.

I'm surprised sort didn't jump on the Mittani's dick again and beg for reinforcements.

I haven’t played in awhile now.  But I do still run the launcher every so often just to download updates in case I find the time to log back in.
---
good
---
What's the point of better tackle on a battlecruiser or HAC? Tackle is typically done with a dictor or fast ship. I'd rather have a mid slot damage mod. I think it would open up a ton of new ship options.
---
Dont forget the Trig t3 and t4, plus ckoaky Trig capital that can generate wormholes
---
I think your wrong. Dual armor reps have less cap usage than a single shield booster. Shields tank more but armor can sustain more while being more cap stable.
---
How do you do it cause that sounds fun
---
never under estimate what a few good guys can accomplish we they get together.
---
No no no.

The fact that it is pointless makes it pointless..

do all sites in wormholes spawn npc

&gt; Dual armor reps have less cap usage than a single shield booster.

they also have less rep power than a single shield booster. Which is why i made the distinction of GJ/EHP.

No they cannot.

Member when you could see the supers in build before you nuked one in build? 
---
Is that possible with Sotiyos?
---
You get a split between the players that go to talk about EVE and the players (nullsec) that go to talk to their EVE friends about anything not EVE. You'll probably enjoy the roundtables and swag rectangletables. Be prepared to buy your kid a bunch of tshirts.
---
Brave has a highsec corp now geared towards new players, partly for this reason (among others). Much softer start to the game for new players and I think it does help to smooth out the new player journey. It is still purely optional, and those who want to jump right into null are welcome to go that route still.
---
Which is why mid-slot damage mods could be very handy on armor tanking ships.  Part of the problem is most fit 3-4 damage mods. Maybe buff the damage bonus and limit it to one slot like a damage control. I just see an obvious trend and it's making armor tanks less viable.
---
The regular epic arcs share faction standings fairly well at the end. Really just depends on what faction you want. Its like a 20% boost at the end of each arc.

I know nothing about it as of now. I can find out if I wanted.
---
gotta be more than a 1 trick pony for that
---
No. The Null Data/Relic sites do not.
---
Is that what I am now?
---
As a newer player, you are absolutely right. Being gifted millions of ISK 'just because' makes the new player content feel incredibly futile. 
---
You should really focus on giving isk in ways that promote engagement with the game. Replacing a lost ship (even just a 1m T1 frigate fit) actually feels like more of a gift than 5 or 10m ISK. It helps new players not get discouraged, while also softening the reality blow that no matter what career path you want to do, there are 10 more players out there whose career goal is to prevent you from doing that. 
---
Providing fittings is incredibly helpful! I know more experienced players feel that fit brewing is itself a big part of the content, since there is no one-fit-to-rule-them-all, but they often forget that new players may not know to stick a Mining Upgrade module on their Venture (for example) because they didn't know the module even existed. 
---
Make sure you are passing along the wisdom that you could lose all of your ships, all of your isk, everything you own in the game, but your skill progression will always go up. So long as new players are continuing their skill training, it becomes exponentially easier to replace lost ships/ISK. This is also not obvious to new players who may only be a few days/weeks into the game.

Forever anthem for TEST, bonus points now relevant again!

Local armor reps have about 15% higher hp/cap. But they do need a lot more power grid, that really restricts armor tanked fittings.
---
As the number 1 anti-botting/rmt alliance of eve... I think u should let the players know
---
That... also sounds like a job.
---
All characters removed who did not have ESI in. Just asked. AOM just got their system setup for it and the people removed didnt add ESI
---
Nothing of value was lost.
---
I just figured they were in hangars or something. That is good to know.
---
This. Players used to use batch files to copy their main characters .dat file data into their alts .dat files which makes everything identical (including however many chats your main is in).
---
But we all know, like the great @ericader stated, that bots only run in Hisec, because its so safe there. I guess GWU is just an admiringly persistant player group and you only harrassed some honourable players ....
---
P.S.: Good job, we harassed the Fade GWU Bots on our last deploy, killed some in I-UU and surroundings, and reinforced the citadels, but that damn TZ tanking did not let us finish them. Glad you had fun with the Astra we gifted you.

Ya nah, I think dude was playing alone, his pve fitting was half passive/active and I have no doubt he bought that ship with mission LP. I'm no teacher, I told him what he did wrong, what he does with that info is on him. I took pity on him largely because of the assholes in my fleet, most other instances I'm fine with non consensual pvp. He was being griefed by multiple dudes. I learned the hard way long ago, and there were decent people here and there who at least gave my pointers at some important moments....

Nice that he’s getting to see the views. When I started a few years ago I was deathly afraid of traveling, or making isk, or just playing the game in general. I joined a few small corps and got my feet wet, until I decided to join up with Horde in null and have never wanted to join or go anywhere else since then.
---
And shield needs a lot more CPU
---
If an astero pilot is good they can be extremely hard to catch.
---

---
&gt;This is is not true as the total number of players will increase overall.
---
This may be true but its come at the expense of ripping up what little social fabric retail wow had left. I explained this to you last time. This is not a point in your favor its a point against you.
---
&gt;Unfortunately, there is nothing to really fix.
---
You are just plain wrong here. There is plenty to fix. It just requires measured change that was actually through about and not just flinging shit at the wall and calling it chaos.
---
After looking over the history of changes wormholes and citadels i can see going away but capitals are definitely not. They were easily in from the early days.
---
That said you seem to have this idea that you will make eve classic if you just remove your personal pet peeves from the game and make it a seperate server. Should they make eve classic a real thing they won't be what they do. 
---
&gt;Lowsec cannot be jumped over, giving lowsec the new life of being the gatekeepers of EvE again.
---
&gt;The largest ships are now battleships, battleship brawls are fucking fun.
---
&gt;It's easier to risk cheap ships more often, than expensive capital ships in single deciding action.
---
&gt;Traveling across EvE becomes much more difficult, conflict becomes much more localized.
---
&gt;Capital Umbrellas are no longer a thing.
---
&gt;Lower entry for new players to reach the endgame of EvE.
---
&gt;More player focus on the FvF, and conversely having more fun.
---
This looks to me like a big list of things they could do to the current game to make it better. EVE Classic is not required for any of these things. You also forget that today is not 2006. People know more and their attitudes are different. And only an utter moron would think that just because you took us back to the game mechanics of 2006 that we would not still optimize every ounce of the game we could get our hands on. Balance problems that weren't evident because of players inexperience will shine like a fog light directly into your retinas.
---
I didn't expect that your posting would get worse but somehow you have surpassed expectations.
---
The simple fact that you don't understand the "it will reduce the playerbase" argument at all shows how little you understand about the subject, and thus makes me wonder why you are so fucking eager to post about it.
---
Fuck off.
---
It's a great idea in theory, although like, EVE is over 16 years old, like yeah you'll have some people who played back then and give it a shot for a bit, but people eventually move on to other things in life and won't have the time for EVE anymore. It will likely happen to you. 
---
Quite a few buddies of mine that quit playing EVE wasn't really about the changes, but more of not having the time to commit to the game.
---
Did you feed dreads and one at a time while killing these? 😆
---
Hmm, maybe it has something to do that they are a 520-ppl-alliance vs. a 6k+ coalition while in O3 it is a 13.5k coalition with 23k batphone vs. a 38k coalition with 44k batphone. Just an idea.
---
No.
---
Unless you can somehow rep your recon long enough and can keep it alive for 5min (lol).
---
Sounds like I'd rather risk that +5 sec of session timer.
---
There's no classic Eve. So your entire post is pointless
---
I legit spend far more time on this sub than i do logged into the game.
---
At this point i think i only maintain my eve account so that i will know what the reddit posts are about.
---
Replace anoms with what are basically abyssal sites that people can follow you into.
---
&gt; you need to check that shit for yourself, then u get your proof.
---
so, i assume you have checked - and thus have proof you can share with us?
---
It's true what they said if you don't put a /s people will take you 100% seriously.
---
its more that PVE is so boring that the most fun way to do it is use drones and tab out.
---
ikr
---
True, I would counterpoint that they didn't have time for the game because it stop being fun. 16 years of highs and lows has seen us with many different versions of EvE, some of them more fun than others. This thread is about figuring out what were missing from the game. If you think back to when your mates still played what were some of the most enjoyable moments? 
---
Because the game has changed so drastically I would build my foundational argument that the best EvE lives somewhere in the past and not the future. From this, I don't believe I can be dissuaded.
---

This is good up until pvp. Pvp is a relatively high level mechanic, which ships costing a lot more on average and the threat of isk loss constant. If I beat up a new to in a shitty pvp ship that likely cost him a days grind, I don't want to subtract from his opinions of moving into it die to cost. By losing his ship, he already saw how easy it can be to lose a reasonable (to him) amount of isk, so he learned that lesson. 
---
   So you refund him his ship and maybe a little extra. Now that he isn't burdened by that ship loss, he can choose. Do I want to continue learning this, or do I want to continue or start something new. This is even more the case in new to pvp because he may not have even known what was happening. How many of us, in our first pvp, really had no idea what was going on and just did random things? Add to that you are now down the ship and all its fittings, and pvp doesn't seem like nearly worth it does it? 
---
   Point of this rant, pve, sure, promote over provide. But in high level actions or pvp, especially against a newbro, don't get stingy with the isk.
---
I would have to check the ACL to be totally sure but I am reasonably certain that Horde as a whole was only given access temporarily for the defense. We have managed to keep the Farthest Shore open for as long as we have partially by willing to go to extremes to defend it, as I think you can attest :), but also by generally staying neutral to whomever claims that area of Genesis. This sadly requires us to restrict access to limit people staging out of our citadel to attack the region or hunt.
---
That said if are willing to restrict yourself to exploration or just wish to come out and visit I can arrange being added on a temporary basis. Especially given the fact you came out to help us before. Just send a mail to Jen Roku and I will get it sorted. I can also give you a list of the other little sites of I interest I'm the region if you would like.
---
10s and yes most of the time. I get why folks rush it though. Rorq save pinged, seconds matter, undock fax and join standing fleet. Except the accept button you clicked was for an invite and now your warped to hostile astra and dying.
---
If the 10 seconds from the session timer matter then you might just have to risk it.
---
Detorid has been falling for a while now. Since the TEST keepstar was dropped the war is more-or-less over.
---
Coming from Eve Vegas last year they delivered on everything that was discussed iirc - which included things like the war changes (which were a great step), ansiblex gates (which were a poor design choice that makes space feel dead, but hey they look neat), 64 bit client, and new trig ships.
---
Then coming from Toronto fanfest this year they also delivered on the new wormhole effects and VNI changes that were discussed. The reboot of tieracide seems to have gone nowhere however.
---
Local armor reps can only be bonused by rig slots. Local shield reps can be bonused by mid slots. This gives local shield a VERY SIGNIFICANT cap/ehp ratio advantage. On top of that you don't need to give up any low slots to get it.
---
Also stop posting stainguy jr

rip drake and hurricane
---
What makes EVE unique for me is that the most enjoyable moments aren't a core game element, but more like sandbox type events so to say. When a small gang of less than half a dozen holds grid against a gang three times our size. When hunting someone you know have a blingy ship and a bunch of counter measures to stay safe, yet you find a hole in their system and get a juicy kill. Or like this one time I was pointing a naglfar on a fortizar grid, in an osprey navy issue while while my corpies were reshipping to something heavier (this was in null and pre cyno changes, so i really didnt think it would work haha).
---
What the game needs is a shift of mentality, more people to adopt the content driver mentality. Too many followers in the game.
---
Why would we? You spotted it -- go post about it if you have something interesting to say.
---
Real talk though: Since AoM is mostly Chinese, there probably is talk about it on Chinese-language social media.
---
I'm not currently playing but I'd like to chime in as a newbie with about 50 hours played (I play a lot of games so I probably won't be back until I have a drought of things to play). 
---
I've tried playing EVE lots of times over the years cause the idea always intrigued me. This last time I tried about 6 months ago was the first time they had a detailed and helpful tutorial, and for the first time I understood the game on a very basic level which is far more than I'd ever gathered in the past.
---
My first piece of advice, definitely do what op is saying and let new players at least finish all of their beginner missions. It's at least a few hours of gameplay and it really does handle teaching a lot of the basic mechanics very well. I was just asking basic questions I could Google because I wanted to participate in chat, and people were kind of bombarding me with lots of info and offers to give me 10-50 million isk. I turned them down simply because I don't like handouts and because it sounds like a lot to a new player. I like having my own early experiences in a game so I kind of avoid getting help until I have some questions, but most people aren't gonna say no to what seems like a bunch of free money.
---
When new players are asking for help, I feel like for the most part we are asking about what to do next and all we ever get is "whatever you want". Which is nice cause I love that about the game but after the tutorial the game give literally no direction so the idea of "just pick something to do" and do it can be daunting. I think most new players are also asking what they can do alone. Joining a Corp is a little daunting to those of us who like to be particular about who we play with, so I found lots of other new players who just weren't ready to join a Corp while still trying to get their footing like me.
---
That's all I can think of right now, but just thought my perspective might be helpful to someone.
---
It was a little complicated but really fun honestly. It has a great, unique feel to the gameplay.
---
Ah, I miss my days as a newbro. It was very exciting for me to explore something and be amazed.
---
Puppy adoption kept me going for a few years after I'd retired to lowsec for the easy life with old friends. After winning eve I still keep in touch with most of the guys I helped find their way.
---
Vicariously enjoying all of their firsts is unique and fulfilling experience. 
---
Also bitter vet corps gain a lot from noobs. They can be useful day 1, from scouting, tackle, ewar and distraction.
---
It's called Armageddon Day and it happened one time in 2007/2008. Everyone had max SP and every system was 0.0.
---
Yes, even Jita.
---
We like to hand out salvaging and ratting ships, skillbooks, and give skill injectors/plex as rewards for contributing to fleets
---
Works way better than dumping isk
---
Entitled coward is what you are. Idiot.
---
EU and USA mostly
---
More than welcome
---
Of course this is EVE we are talking about. You actually think anyone plays this game meta or not?
---
I mean doing any type of grinding is a job in that case, I guess.
---
If that is how you see games, cool.
---
I bought one in Aridia once and wandered null, living out of it. 
---
Took the guy that sold it to me almost 2 months to catch me. :D
---
Can confirm am on desktop and it did default to new sorting.
---
And where would be the fun in that?
---
I appreciate you taking the time to respond. I don't know if your social fabric would be ripped apart TBH. I would like to think it wouldn't, but your right I honestly can't say. Instead I will say that I hope your future holds new friends, whomever yet they may be.
---
&gt; After looking over the history of changes wormholes and citadels i can see going away but capitals are definitely not. They were easily in from the early days. 
---
Sure, but everyone owning one? Definitely not!!! Some our best history lay fallow with the first titans ever created. BoB and Goon war was a classical struggle **that even at the time saw vast numbers of capsuleers despair that the game would be forever lost** when they were unable to destroy BoB's titan. Note it was the only titan in existence at the time. Is it a good thing? I don't think so, but Classic EvE did have capital ships for sure, and there is an appeal to owning them which draws people in.
---
&gt; That said you seem to have this idea that you will make eve classic if you just remove your personal pet peeves from the game and make it a seperate server. Should they make eve classic a real thing they won't be what they do. 
---
Yes, this is what I'm doing this for, and you may be right, or you maybe wrong.
---
&gt; People know more and their attitudes are different. And only an utter moron would think that just because you took us back to the game mechanics of 2006 that we would not still optimize every ounce of the game we could get our hands on. 
---
Yup! Counting on it, but you forget one thing. EvE can't remain 35+ year olds protecting their "assets" forever. Young people need a chance to make this their game too. And the power gaming to get everyone into a titan is a rat race were all going to lose.
---
I have a bunch still unopened if you're interested. I'll have to find them but I only opened maybe 5 card packs.
---
lol, fuck me. I'm going to report this whole reddit to CCP for botting. Hahaha
---
There are +7s on the test server iirc but currently the best training implants are +5 attribute. I don't think there has been any discussion from the devs about adding +6s or +7s
---
I started with explo a year or two ago, and the only time people gave me isk was when they blew up my ship and I chatted with them about how to do better. That helped a lot because it didn’t feel like such a huge setback, because I could afford a new ship, and instead of heading back with valuable cargo, I headed back to station with some new ideas on how to fly.
---
Blackout begins: July 12  
---
Cyno changes: September 10  
---
Blackout ends: September 16
---
Following this pattern, I would expect CCP to spend about a month analyzing the effects of the cyno changes in isolation (at least as much isolation as is possible in EVE), and about a month planning their next move. If CCP decides the cyno changes worked, expect them to stick around. If not, expect them to be reverted or significantly mitigated when the next phase arrives. Also note that Icelanders seem to be pretty serious about their vacations, so it's possible CCP might have phase 3 ready to go before October is over.
---
Hey crystal it’s Xeno T how you doing ?
---
Until someone with 100 dread alts found you
---
There are plenty of border areas with low activity that you can gate a DST through to fit up your carrier. There isn’t that much to actually haul anyways, with most of the actual volume being in the form of Fighters instead of cap mods, which can be built for decently cheap if you have capital skills, or can be found seeded throughout LS.
---
Name vaguely half rings a bell, who?
---
F
---
and a possible friend.
---
Not if you downtime tank. Assuming you could actually play in those hours
---
I was wondering what and where the Corp is that you have. I've been winning EvE for awhile and have WH experience but was honestly still pretty bad at the game. I would love to join and re-learn the game while passing on some information to new players.
---
Seen multiple Rattle streams lately and they perform very well. I think they also cost similar to a non-blinged carrier.
---
Basic point with these things is decloak is hard and preventing crashing is more a question of whether you have a web on it quickly enough (you probably don't if you're on the other side of the gate to the decloak).
---
Nullified T3 and ships like the Astero are quite hard to catch unless you're skilled and/or there are dozens of you camping the gate.
---
Whether they're "bot looking" or not is a different issue.  I know the one I fly isn't.
---
Remove injectors and mining rorquals, bring back old moon mining system, work on structure spam reduction, remove entosis link and  guess what  ... in a year you will have classic eve on TQ
---
*Regurgtated*
---
&gt;  I don't know if your social fabric would be ripped apart TBH. 
---
My guild died from the turbo attrition caused by classic. And then my new guild also stopped raiding. My M+ group stopped doing keys as well. All because we lost key people to classic.
---
&gt;Sure, but everyone owning one? Definitely not!!!
---
This happened as a result of the cap on their production being removed and massive injections of raw materials to make them. Remove one or both of those things and the supply will start to drop off.
---
&gt;Yup! Counting on it, but you forget one thing. EvE can't remain 35+ year olds protecting their "assets" forever.
---
You are forgetting about a VERY important asset that i was trying to highlight. Knowledge. New players don't have it vets do have it. There will quickly be a gap possibly much wider than it is today as a result.
---
When I was new, my corp gave me both isk and ships, doing lvl 1 missions, you find it early on that its a waste of time, to simple to complete. I went to do SoE mission quickly and made more isk.
---
So what do you think about...  
---
### Rubicon?
---
Nope
---
https://i.imgur.com/c7epcfU.gif
---
Same happened to me, now i do the same
---
Jintaan pls. This goes against the agenda of people on this reddit.
---
We based out of metropolis area and the corp ticker is ART5. https://evewho.com/corporation/98582239
---
We the 9th biggest independent corp and we fully independent and self funded.
---
They'd have to actually (re?)hire some talented devs for this ever to be a possibility.  They current ones are training to be male nurses, so they're trying to perfect their bandaid skills.
---
A big part of the warp fleet kills haven't happened during a response fleet.
---
Yes ccp could implement the standing of the one inviting you next to his name, a warning base on standing but even with that people will still die.
---
Eve teachs lessons to you or other players if you don't learn or remember you deserve to turn into a loot piniata and content :p
---
You get loyalty points that you can spend in the LP store to get faction items to sell
---
Very easy to do both.
---
no
---
Just waiting to resub if they nerf local again.
---
Also, be prepared to do some pvp, it's awesome
---
Well your particular playstyle is ruining the game so your opinion has been discarded. My playstyle is obviously the way everyone is meant to be playing and is made in no way better by the existence of other people doing different things to me.
---
Spool up torp launchers with a unique mechanic; they start out firing Light Missiles and over the next minute spool up to firing Citadel Torpedoes.  Of course, sticking with the Triglawlvian niche, they'll still have the application of light missiles.
---
How dare you tell me that people can be angry about different things and not like what I like
---
Stop providing information other than "reeeeee BOTS!". This is Reddit, everyone you dont like is a bot/enables botters/rmt's/etc
---
Uhhhhhh no they can't. Obviously there is only one way to play and it's &lt;that guy's&gt;. Every other way is super duper bad and CCP should change it.
---
tbf he also loses titans in hilarious ways so its two trick
---
reeeeeeeee fuck carebears reeeeeeeee they build my ships so i can do my elite pvp reeeeeeee but fuck them still reeeeeeeeeeee
---
Sure, there are plenty of folks who die because they are lazy or dumb. I am not disputing that. I just think that CCP's ui deserves as much blame/credit as the players do for dying to this.
---
The whole Abyssmal site mechanic is terrible in general.  Being instanced and risk free makes them anti-EVE, but letting people follow you into them would make them nothing but risk with the niche fits required to deal with the OP rats and stupid timer.  Nobody would do em because it would be about as smart as marauder ratting in the blackout.
---
EDIT:  whoops, shoulda been a response to the guy above you, reee
---
What you do in that scenario is just decloak and mwd to gate. The decloak delay on the dictor is long enough that you don’t need to worry about dying before you get there, especially if you are dualprop.
---
that's exactly what bluebeard would say
---
Im curious what I’m a one trick at
---
Did he get to see the titan as it boson'd him out of existence?
---
I check in anticipation of Hilmtard's next turbo-ree.  You know when there's an accident on the other side of the interstate and traffic on your side slows to a crawl, cuz everyone has a morbid obsession with the fiery disaster?  That's how it is with the current "dev" team.
---
I must say that since you are no longer CSM, you've gotten better.
---
I have a newborn who was in the NICU for 3m and have been online less than once week on average lately. You can be very casual in many Null entities.
---
Am I the only one who was reading the ping with a chinese accent in mind?
---
But I think the correct approach would be "nerf to excavators, removal of capital ratting and adjustment to blue loot".
---
Plot twist. OP is playing both characters...
---
&gt; Claiming that she was blowing ccp members for a job. 
---
I mean, she wasn't likeable, knowledgeable, or qualified for anything, so one has to wonder exactly how she did get that job.
---
Nah, he didn’t make it too far off of gate.
---
Winning wars, apparently. vOv
---
My current playstyle is log in occasionally and look at my skill queue, check Amarr Emperor chat, consider buying a Loki, and then playing minecraft instead. Am I meant to undock and do stuff a few times a week instead?
---
Havent seen you in a hot minute redline how you been. And appreciate it
---
Not having to be the ~respectable~ link between CCP and the general playerbase means I can get down in the muck and shitpost again. 
---
I like it that way.
---
Hilmtard carefully weighed the pros and cons, and calculated that if he gets rid of the o7 show, community team, and about 5 other community-building things that can't be monetized, he could start another failed game project.  We know which he chose.
---
I will still comment on mispronunciations on your videos. 😛
---
Good fights, guys!
---
An assault frigate will live longer
---
Regular carriers are pure shit atm, small drones do more dps some of the time
---
Rabiasu
---
Soy toyo (Which turns out isn't a coffee contraption from Starbucks)
---
&gt; What the game needs is a shift of mentality, more people to adopt the content driver mentality. Too many followers in the game. 
---
True, I agree there is a lot of followers in the game. At the same time the barrier to entry to leading is quite high as well as the costs associated with leadership are steap. I also believe you can't change people to want to drive conflict, but you can make it easier for them to initiate it.
---
I think people generally understand this; where the animosity comes from is that certain types of gameplay aren't healthy to the overall ecosystem of the game; some of which are very popular/lucrative
---
it kinda looks like your 1 trick is winning.
---
Shit. Where were you 100 years ago? Your knowledge could have saved us a rough couple years.
---
Sucks bro, my condolences. If your right, they will be back though.
---
Is there any tips about the pvp that you would give
---
And they just recently opened up a 2nd front against AOM. So there's that ...
---
Yes, that OP would be the mission puller.
---
The neutral alt would be a different character.
---
This is missing the point. Some things keep people in the game, some things drive people from the game. Players doing PvE/mining/etc in space act as content for others to hunt. Hunters act as content to remove some tedium of PvE/mining. The two form a balance where each makes the game better for the other.
---
On the other hand, there are actively toxic gameplay styles. The best example of this is the old highsec wardecs. Highsec wardecs were having a disproportionate impact of a few people being able to drive many players out of the game, heavily weighted towards new players. This is an example of a gameplay style that is easy to show was detrimental to the game.
---
I still remember my first time seeing an actual player flown Titan in game. Wasn't expecting to see it then and it completely shocked me.
---
However my favorite "titan experience" was the time the time the fleet I was in, a training fleet made up of less then 20 frigates/destroyers, decided to kamikaze ourselves against a titan we ran into in Goonspace.
---
So who's at fault for the stupid idea? The people who took an obvious mistake as gay gospel, or the people who made an obvious mistake? :P
---
Shit is there, stinking, wheather you stirr it or not :)
---
I can once a week
---
Sunday.
---
You know it would help to read the comments made in that link misconceptions part they make most of my points.
---
Which coincidentally sounds a lot like ignoring legitimate criticism
---
I totally agree here.
---
4 years ago or so I was a pirate blogger and one of the guys who joined the game because of my blog met me in a 1v1 and I beat him. He then started a convo and asked for help. He wanted to learn solo pvp and so I gave him a great atron fit that I knew worked well with some instructions and tactic around how to use the fit.
---
I then gave him 100 million isk to go and buy 10 of them  because the challenge was called the Eric Shang 10 ship challenge and they where 10 mil each fitted. I said to him that if brings me a proper solo kill back within 10 losses I will give him a pirate frigate hull of choice. Now he could have taken the 100 mil and ran but he did take on the challenge.
---
[https://zkillboard.com/character/95190225/](https://zkillboard.com/character/95190225/)
---
That's the pilot. He is a nasty solo pilot now and I am kind of proud of what he has achieved. He still to this day sends me really good kill mails where he soloed something and just wanted to share it with someone.
---
I love the fact that something so small an interaction can set the person onto their path and makes them enjoy the game. He wanted to be a solo expert and so I helped him. I showed him the door but its up to the pilot to walk in.
---
So yes PVP is tricky and not something you get right easily but also there is something that prevents players from doing PVP in this game and I will create another post about it soon.
---
I don't want eve classic I want an Eve Unchained (Kill the injectors and restart everyone from start.) 
---
Game design wise imagines having to put together the first keep star when you don't have the industrial capacity of infinity rorquals.
---
The only thing that would get me back at this point is a Fresh Start without skill injectors and the promise they'd never be introduced.
---
Sorry, what's your point?
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Relic_and_data_sites#Is_this_site_.22safe.22_to_warp_to.3F
---
Nice work. I'm always buying salvage. :)
---
Dude, you'll get that when everyone else migrates off the wormhole containment server.
---
I support this development. It's like the hunterseeker of naval games, eve holes only.
---
Good post.
---
You're discovering what charities have come to realize about giving just monetary aid, eg to poorer countries.
---
Art5, aka potato empire, wouls fit your name perfectly.
---
Just refit it to nothing but WCS and align time lows, then max insure it and fly where you’re going. If you die, collect insurance and buy a new one.
---
I realize how webs work. But unless you are doing something like AT with hundreds of billions of isk on the line, those insane priced modules in general just arent worth it. I understand something like a faction super being blinged to hell and back, its fun to shine and you might as well get as much bang for your buck as possible. 100th the cost for 75-95% of the effectiveness is a pretty good deal for the vast, VAST majority of cases.
---
Don't they have teams so that both can be the case?
---
That's not a plot twist. That's typical gameplay.
---
/r/Eve is like Herpes. You might think you got rid of it but then it comes back at the wrong time and infects more people.
---
SOE DESTROYER.
---
I WANT IT. IF YOU DON'T WANT IT, FUCK YOU.  
---
(give it 50mb or somethin ccpls)
---
There was a really good post by angry mustache. And CCP didn't offer a word.
---
It took me 5 years to figure out how to get to nullsec
---
U know u can still play solo in a big alliance. U just have more options and gameplay styles being in a group
---
PM'd you
---
Insurance on em sucks tho ;)
---
fuck of FW Faggy. WORMHOLES ARE LYFE is tattoo'd on my right forearm!
---
IDK, a speed advantage doesn't really make a difference when you just uncloak untop of people. you may as well use a stratios for cloaky ambush shit.
---
hey are you not flying nano ships?
---
Gonna say it, Fuck faction capitals right now, the entire playerbase would benefit more from subcap introduction
---
The minimum thing that needs to happen is that militia members can't dock in a system that the opposite faction controls - which I suggested as an alternative. I don't think it's helpful for pirates to be able to stage in every system, though, so that's I'd suggest removing them entirely.
---
Let me put the opposite question to you: what is good about Upwell structures being allowed in FW space?
---
Nope, we need capitals ratting so people can hunt them.       
---
Trust me killing ratting carrier give more fun than killing a bling rattlesnake.
---
My vote was Horde. Really great people and plenty to do. Free ships and skillbooks upon joining and moving, easily worth over 40M ISK, provided by the corp. They have mining fleets, ratting fleets, pvp fleets, and plenty of structures and space to do pretty much whatever your heart desires. All you've gotta do is send an application in to Pandemic Horde Inc. and wait about eight hours or so, and then check the Join Horde chat before you accept if you have a lot of stuff to move. If you're like me, and only had a venture, liquidate and move your clone to it was easier than capsuling out 18 jumps. Then I got made fun of by an IRL friend who told me I could've shuttled. But yeah, horde is amazing. Moon extractions look fun and I'll be partaking in one tonight in my new proc.
---
I do and I haven't signed on for 2 years :((((
---
I am terrified
---
so basically a feeder corp
---
I spend far fewer than 5 minutes per site making bookmarks. If it saves a single siege cycle, it's not wasting time.
---
Not really, this update was supposed to shake things up like some chosen one update but all it did was kill all the younglings
---
Exactly this. Some gameplay styles are better for the game than others. 
---
Example from another game: you go play counter strike but avoid shooting anyone and just run away from enemies. Or you go camp the same corner of the map in every game and don't move. Your team mates and your enemies hate you and if there would be more players like you the game would go down the toilet. Same idea works also in Eve.
---
post aar plz /u/Seddows
---
Was in Darwin left to try wh which didn’t work haha
---
didn't they make a thread just so that this bs doesn't get through
---
your point is very valid and so we at ART5 think of ourselves not as a corporation but as a social group of vets and new players that are there to help each other. I have a leadership team in place and senior staff that want to help new players enjoy the game. Granted we not perfect but we try and help as much as we can when required and asked for. 
---
We don't care about killboards, We don't care about your play style. As long as you don't gank a corp mate and don't scam people I am happy for you to do what ever you want as long as you have fun. That's really what we about and so if you ever come back. Gives us a look or don't. Its your time, RL money and fun.
---
&gt; They choose to listening to their smallest, yet very vocal player base on suggestions to "fix" an entirely opposite playstyle. 
---
Oh the irony...
---
yeah we still see those children with flies on them...
---
This is the best example that CCP actually do stuff. But Lal of this is drowned by the complains.
---
Implying I don't find the legitimate criticism on the sub useful.
---
What I dislike is this dumb trend of crab-bucketing and throwing shit on how other people play the game, as if the people playing the game are the problem and not CCP's shitty fucking design decisions.
---
&gt;The best example of this is the old highsec wardecs. Highsec wardecs were having a disproportionate impact of a few people being able to drive many players out of the game, heavily weighted towards new players. This is an example of a gameplay style that is easy to show was detrimental to the game.
---
So much for eve being a harsh place. The number of players when highsec wardecs were a thing versus the number of players without high-sec wardecs now. Some of the most fun I had was when Privateers Alliance was going on, hunting various alliances in high-sec. 
---
I don't know if people know this but you can create a system where you can both have war in high-sec against relevant entities and have new players protected for a limited period.
---
Know your enemy's ship and what it can do. Pick your fights and know when to avoid someone...
---
In fact. Look up the corp Aideron Robotics... Join them and flourish. They are newbro friendly
---
No matter what, don't let him start his own hauling service.
---
First thing came to mind reading about updating new batches of ship fittings. That in the past when corp/alliance logos were uploaded, it something's took a year for them to be updated in game.
---
I wish they added this more like a feature for the entire community to vote on. Like in dota
---
Let's hope they see this newplayer fitting as foundation towards something bigger and better
---
Everyday you stray further from the light brother.
---
not really, no. These days I find myself in FW lowsec so I either brawl or scram-kite.
---
I'm done being ironic. This is semi-serious now. Grrrr wormholes.
---
It doesn't matter how many people actually go in.
---
It is equally as dangerous with 1 or 2 or 3, and provides equal rewards.
---
The only difference is that the frigate ones have 3 times the rewards as a cruiser ones.
---
I think you missing the point of the post.
---
Yes, SS-903, EG-603 and TA-703
---
Ill add them to the video later. Thanks for the message
---
Look up the corp Aideron Robotics. Join them and flourish. They are pretty newbro friendly and are very active in FW
---
Get better internet dude.
---
I can do a fresh install and be up and running in 5 minutes.
---
yes, yes, no. The moon mining system was a bit fucked.
---
I've never ganked anyone, but if I start I'm going to keep this tradition alive.
---
Wow. Im kinda shocked we are seeing a positive change. Good job CCP!
---
I miss that game :'(
---
Lets just say we agree to disagree. The ultra early part of EVE sucks because the accumulation of wealth is extremely slow, which hinders the activities a new player can take. Money is freedom to do things, the quicker you have money, the more free you are from the rock that is low reward PvE to replace something you lose.
---
I know one of the guys that got their fit added. He is offline for about a year now and the fit is from October '17. -_-
---
One good part of hisec wardecs is killing billion-isk crap since they bling out literally every ship. Stimulates the economy!
---
It has been o7'd
---
&gt;So you're saying hundreds upon hundreds of players are creating explo alts where the literal only thing that character does is explo? 
---
Yes? Why not. It doesn't take much time to have an alt on your same account setup to do explo so your main can do other stuff.
---
It's a sandbox. Everything that matters is player-created, starting with harvesting materials.
---
It started, I think, with CODE. A pile of trolls decided that hi-sec shouldn't exist and casuals were not welcome *at all*, period, and CCP said, "Wellp. It's a sandbox, if their playstyle is gatekeeping, so be it."
---
Then it became, "Industry players who don't fight are leeches." Nevermind that you need them. Next, it was indies. How dare you populate this galaxy without participating in The Warz?
---
As time goes on, CCP tries to make the game more accessible for the less obsessed and the less competitive, and the remaining player base resents this more and more.
---
This game isn't going to die because it ages out. It's going to die because pretty soon, everybody will be subject to a constant stream of abuse whenever they're logged in and *not in combat*.
---
i am still kinda new (bout a month) and i joined a young corp and damn thats the best thing that happened to me we are actually kinda just a few weirdos talking while semi afk mining or ratting... but we help each other when ever we can... corps are a nice thing
---
Alright folks, populate this with alpha friendly and new guy fittings so we can retain players!
---
Considering those are oxys, I suggest insuffilation if you're struggling to swallow them.
---
This completely defeats the purpose of *having* hisec. That's where you were supposed to be able to play if you don't want to PvP.
---
This sounds ludicrous to most of this subreddit because everybody who doesn't wanna PvP was pushed out of the game. You know, what with the wardecs and the bumping.
---
well yes,, but it allowed to create a lot of fights
---
Killing Elo fleets is a nice trick to have.
---
Thanks
---
so much this. When someones whole plan is to demotivate you so you dont play and they win, guess in what spectrum those people belong
---
Items in hangars don't show up in killmails, only items in build. This is due to the asset safety in k-space.
---
can we please get over the "nullsec is creating the ships you are flying"
---
you should be.
---
New meta.
---
Good video. The kills where a bit lackluster though.
---
Can be looked at that way I suppose, yeah. It also just gives a space for people not as interested in null to still be a part of the alliance community without living out there.
---
We do nano Niddy's now.
---
wise words gramps
---
&gt; It started, I think, with CODE.
---
oh you sweet summer child.
---
The ultra early par of eve sucks.. maybe for you. I had a blast the first 2 weeks before joining a corp and this was back in 2008.
---
Your view of the game is a little off. Isk does not make you enjoy the game. The game makes you enjoy the game. Isk is only something you get from doing something well.
---
Just like in real life. People would do a fun job 1000% of the time than a shit job paid well. That's just human nature.
---
What you saying is fuck the fun. give them Isk and let them make more Isk and soon they will have fun. I can tell you now that this is not the case. Look at people who come to EVE, Buy plex and have 1 billion in their wallet. How many of those people are still about in 1 year. I bet you 10%. Now take someone that has found the enjoyment of the game and made Isk slowly while having fun while learning the mechanics of the game. How many of them are still here: a lot more than 10%.
---
There are communities for both, and custom modded also. The game is better now than it was in 2003.
---
Can only kill what's out there. People were offline or in highsec. Glad you liked the video though.
---
The room spawns are the same no matter how many ships enter them. The rewards are also the same.
---
Totally wrong.
---
High sec ganking didnt start in 2013 as you claim. No matter how hard Code. tries to sell it like they created the idea.
---
There were pirate groups from the get go and many groups with the exact same ideology that you claim Code. invented.
---
Hell Goons had a dedicated sig to ganking high sec and trying to get people to move to Low/Null in 2009.
---
Downvoted for trying to farm karma.
---
so you give the pilots everything for joining a null sec alliance and pressing f1?
---
I really like that that they changed the war decs to only corps that have stations being vulnerable.
---
Without the war system hi-sec will be littered by the eyesore of a thousands of unfurled dead stations.
---
If you want to stay in HS forever, and never be in a war, you can do that now, but the moment you start building sand castles someone is going to kick it.
---
To the extent that it worked? I don't think so, judging by the fact that hisec was populated in 2013.
---
But the point stands either way. If casuals aren't welcome, it's not a sandbox.
---
Frankly, and this has always been true, the only true indies in EVE are trolls. It's the only MMO that welcomes them with open arms, and their hobby is sitting between new players and the reasons they should stick around, waving their middle fingers and singing schoolyard taunts. They're the only reason EVE never got to be five times larger than it did.
---
Wow, I had completely forgotten that was a thing back when I played SWG!
---
My first MMO. Looking back I don't think it was very good, but I still had fun with it. ;)
---
While I don't disagree with your statement, we start running into trouble when start assuming we're right and begin to persecute other playstyles.   
---
Do you \*really\* know that playstyle X is truly bad? Can you define bad/good in this context? There's a lot of inference based on really limited data that most armchair game-designers make when they talk about what's bad/good for the game.
---
&gt;to rebalance alot
---
They've been rebalancing for so long, it's more like juggling now.
---
You're not going to see crazy changes like this stick in the game when null-sec alliance members control such a large percentage of the paid accounts.  Yeah, you might unsub 1 or 2 PVP accounts, but I just reopened 16 paid mining accounts. 
---
The economics just don't multiply to your favor.
---
same
---
downvote for thinking karma means anything.
---
I think I've seen your Corp around. Y'all throw out cans around gates?
---
You mean like HS ganking was and null sec afk ratting is?
---
Please gunpoint diplomacy started permits
---
I never said anything about nullsec.
---
not to my knowledge...
---
My hel died under 1 min so all depending on the fight
---
Hmm I know the ticker from somewhere just can't remember.
---
unbelievable how someone can be so wrong.  
---
Highsec griefing has been in the game since the start and not since 2013.  
---
People that only see this game as a farm simulator are hurting the economy.  
---
CCP has dumbed down the game so much that 2019 eve has nothing in common with lets say 2008 and that is because the predominant style of gameplay has switched to carebearing. You can say whatever you want and its a sandbox and blah blah blah, but you cannot tell me cool and good stories in the present age EVE, cause it has become dull and boring.  
---
The game is going to die because of the empire building and the status quo with no real wars or at least wars that have effect on alliances. It is also going to die because its boring, too many content creators have left the game and big alliances want to preserve their empires, noone is fighting, there are actually 3000 titans in the game that are never fighting each other and all people care about is their safe ratting and being able to see a hunter 25j out while they get a personalized ping by an out of game tool.  I wouldnt sperge that much about 0.0 but with the state that CCP has left lowsec there is actually no other playgrounds for pvp in eve.
---
ok, noone ever cared about carebears in highsec your point is off
---
They fold against a single active tanked Stratios though.
---
&gt; noone ever cared about carebears in highsec
---
feelsbadman
---
Haha this is great.
---
Can a Stratios break a Rattle tank though?
---
its not fully ccp's fault though either.  
---
The player base is also at fault.  i see people complain all the time about how there are no fights... well if you want wars and fights, make your alliance leaders sign in and have them go to war.  
---
AFAIK no actual war in eve was EVER fought over a resource.  All the big ones were because group x hated group y.  When all the big alliances are buddy buddy and don;t want to fight each other, you hit the issues we currently have.  And nothing CCP does will EVER change that long term.  
---
So players are a HUGE part of the problem.  (yes some of the game mechanics make it difficult for people to actually want to fight as its 'unfun' but even with that, and even before citadels and fozzie sov, fights were slowing down for different reasons.)
---
Up to 3 players will receive the same bounty, but the loot/salvage will need to be divided.  So, if you solo the site and receive 4.5 mill, you'll get all the goodies. 3 players will all receive the same 4.5 mill bounty and divide goodies 3 ways.
---
Yea but at the same time it created a new issue say I have a moon for mining a corp comes and starts mining with orcas ok I'll dec them so I can keep them off my moon oh they have no structures so I cant dec them at best I can try bumping. Realistically theres not much I could do.
---
&gt; It started, I think, with CODE. A pile of trolls decided that hi-sec shouldn't exist
---
What did you lose?
---
Yep, this is what I started pushing for in CSM11, what was ultimately implemented is essentially one of the versions of what we proposed back then.
---
You can't remove wardecs because of structures. I wouldn't want to entirely remove them because they have their purpose and people use them for valid purposes. There is nothing wrong with the highsec wardec crews wardeccing GSF(and other big groups) and killing our idiots in highsec, they're getting kills, our idiots are getting farmed, everyone is happy and nobody is quitting the game over it. Using wardecs to farm new player corporations was terrible for the game and the new system fixes it gracefully.
---
Credit to CCP here also for iterating on them after the emergency fix and landing on what I think is a good overall design.
---
&gt; No matter how hard Code. tries to sell it like they created the idea.
---
They don't actually.
---
literally 3 days ago  
---
hence this post...
---
i dont disagree with you, but, when ccp tells you "hey, do you want to make 300m ticks with our new supers" all alliances will say hell yeah.  Also i understand the 16 year old game everyone knows and have fought each other
---
Swing by the stream sometime and I might be playing with viewers or something!
---
I'll give you an example,  CCP introduced Technetium as a rare resource that could be fought over.  What happened?  After BoB was dead, the large alliances got together and setup a consortium.  they ignored each others tech moon in exchange for setting the prices.  No alliance went 'hey i have a tech moon and goon has 3 i want there moons, lets kill them'  For all the bluster of null sec groups (and yes i owned space in null sec three times in my 15 years here) they are REALLY risk and war adverse.
---
downvoted
---
it made so much fucking content tho like x5 more than the next best thing now
---
Active fit yeah because they run all neuts in the highs and geckos do big dammies
---
Not enough data to draw conclusions pilot B might be autistic
---
Waiting for content from CCP is like waiting for a new kidney - you really want it, but the wait is killer.
---
Still waiting on a matching donor for those shield slaves, btw.
---
Do not get me wrong, I agree with 100%. I am not really advocating that CCP waste their time on capital ships less than 1% of EVE players will ever own... 
---
I am just pointing out that they literally did not complete their own plan to introduce Angel capitals, despite having worked on them and already having completed art assets; therefore, in #EVE2019 I am not going to hold my breath while we wait for CCP to actually get around to adding new ships. 
---
I mean, maybe a better thing to say would be: bombers are broken and 80% of people know this, and CCP cannot be bothered to do a balance pass on them, so how can we expect them to design and balance a whole set of faction battlecruisers?
---
Be ready with your/your corps Orca when the chunk pops.
---
Or have everyone in your corp train a alpha to fly a Talos and blast them.
---
Now I kinda want him to tackle me.
---
yea that too makes it hard.  
---
there is a ton of isk that come sout of null, even i knew this when i was near Atlas and had a super in my alliance that just ran amons all day.  A balance of isk in null need to happen.  But CCP can;t force anyone to fight.
---
They should make it easier to fight, i love citadels and want pos' dead. but even i see that they need a huge tweek and are too strong in several instances.  and i understand why people dislike fozzie sov and thing a balance can be found, to make it different then just 'form up, send hours shooting this one structure, boom sov'
---
The patching is the REAL chaos part.
---
If you're too retarded to write one sentence without mistakes you probably shouldn't be making "hard to swallow pills"-memes. Let alone fly internet spaceships
---
The only thing I complain about is groups that start many wars (lol PIRAT) at once and the fact that they can set a DIFFERENT HQ for each war, this prevents the war recipients from coordinating against the attacker.
---
That's a bit like asking how dark is the color blue. It all depends on your fit and their fit(s).
---
but ratting bad
---
Nah, we just skip the drudge of fucking highsec new player expirience and get them involved in pvp and actually lucrative pve activities to sustain that gameplay. 
---
Additionally, Most newbro focused fleet roles are anything but f1 blob mindlessness. Tackle, ewar, scouting, entosis, anti-bomber, etc.
---
That and we highly encourage new and highly active players to join our SIGs and special ops teams where they can contribute a ton without needing to sit in perfectly skilled HACs or capitals. 
---
Its not about the money, its about opening up all that EVE has to offer.
---
the installer is busy deleting your boot.ini file.
---
In the age of timers demotivating your opponents so they stop fighting back is the only way to win a war in nullsec. Since there are no resources and very little territory worth fighting for this is the only end goal for fighting period.
---
&gt; how many capitals, how many rorquals died in high sec
---
thonking
---
Bounties in abyssal deadspace? What?
---
never seen someone more beta in my life
---
Well, when one playstyle results in absolutely no player interaction, a massive disparity of wealth and imbalance, and overall stagnation of the game, yeah, you could objectively say its bad.
---
Having met him in person I can confirm he's p. cute
---
Like a pocket-sized Pete Townshend
---
I know this reference
---
omg this release schedule just shows how out of touch CCP really is.
---
\#lackluster
---
Active tanks and ratting fits - most likely. I used to solo hunt them in my Strat back before I won Eve.
---
I wouldn’t say it solves the problem “gracefully”. Being 100% immune to legal non consensual PvP isn't great.
---
ooooo looking forward ton helping with this
---
I do try
---
With a name like that, I hope you play some steve miller band in the background.
---
It's more that there's a certain amount of sentiment for Frat's "Fuck you, we'll fight" attitude.
---
Haha i definitely will now that you mentioned it
---
what if I told you that you could build *and* PvP and that carebears are actually a cancer on the game exerting a “dumb down” effect?
---
And dank Burt Reynolds memes.
---
Krabbing isn't much of a game.
---
Only a filthy Redditor would think like this.
---
&gt;This is is not true as the total number of players will increase overall. As from real world data, Classic WoW INCREASED not decreased the total number of players for BFA.
---
Are you actually this retarded?
---
Awesome!
---
I'm already out, so don't try to fix it now :)
---
I would disagree.
---
&gt; legal
---
The key word here. Even in Ultima Online, known for overly brutal PKs, you could be 100% immune to legal non-consensual PvP. I'm in agreement that immunity to non-consensual PvP in Eve is a bad thing, but the notion there should be a way to do it to anyone, anywhere, and without consequence is absurd.
---
&gt; personalized ping by an out of game tool
---
Just so you know, this is *never* going away.  CCP literally can't stop it unless they're going to physically detain people irl and keep them in separate rooms. It boils down to people talking and sharing info.  If they remove the stuff from in game, people can just use discord to accomplish the same thing.
---
I think the fix for blackout wasn't to get rid of it.  The fix for blackout was to nerf wormhole null connections.  Blackout while being able to potentially scout enemy fleets allows counterplay.  A wormhole appearing in the system next to you really didn't give you any counterplay.
---
Whatever you say man.  I feel bad for you, believing everyone is out ruin the world.
---
Don't forget about Sword and Crown skins...
---
Which banker was that?
---
theres no bounties, and you're on a timer, so you're not salvaging.
---
Indeed we do Jericho
---
The fact that this game has ALWAYS been such that individuals are incentivized to multibox to that ridiculous degree in order to "keep up with the Joneses" was ALWAYS going to be the slippery slope that eventually ruined the game.
---
too true. 6 combat rorqs dropped on anything that even enters lowsec.
---
I used to mine in a Probe until I had enough minerals to build 3 or 4 Rifters and then ship them 12 junps or so to the nearby trade hub and sell them.  Felt like I was really achieving something, fun memories to think back on compared to nowadays where less than a few hundred an hour isn't worth the effort.
---
Sounds more like a problem with how cheap caps are too lose than an issue with how expensive they are to move
---
Dude... You need to take a chill pill
---
dope
---
A stratios can kill a ratting rattle though it can be sketchy depending on his fit. A PVP rattle should generally assblast a stratios into another dimension or at the very least have no issues escaping unless it's a no prop rattle or something.
---
Check out /r/evejobs
---
cool, what lucrative pve do you have and get them involved in if I may ask?
---
No. It has to be an account created through steam, although you can convert a steam account to a regular account and take advantage of sales on both platforms that way.
---
Its Vegas. Hookers and blow.
---
He means "bounty" as in "loot".
---
I see you now lol
---
vs an actual pvp fit rattle the stratios will likely eat shit
---
Haha
---
That's awesome. This is going to be very useful in helping my friends get into the game. I was kind of at a loss when I found out BattleClinc shutdown.
---
?
---
I did thank you
---
Krabs don't fit for pvp
---
the pop up stops you being able to click on an anomaly.
---
I store those in many of my ships ;)
---
noob question
---
How are you getting these people to actually warp to the structure? The freighter for example. Is it freeported, and then you turn the switch to private once they warp to the grid?
---
That would be so fucking epic
---
no sabre....downvoted.
---
Pretty sure that was never the point of hisec...CCP tried for years to push players out of high and into null, they failed miserably so the players just did it themselves in the end, but the whole time they were telling us that was what we were 'supposed' to do.
---
More to the point though I imagine anyone not interested in pvp would probably quit before too long regardless of CODE or wardecs because the pve in this game is fucking terrible, if you want more pve players or more players in high sec I think you are much better off complaining about that.
---
I can't see it from here, but are you quoting the net imports or gross imports? Also, I think The Forge includes some lowsec systems. Someone may could have moved a capital/super fleet in there. Though that wouldn't explain other regions...
---
Was just talking about you the other day. Introduced your vids to a corp mate and he was way into it. Glad to see you're back at it again.
---
It depends.
---
Lol no, talk to people who quit. Gankers are just the cherry on top for most of them, the game had and still has a large variety of problems that chase people out. Trig invasions in starter constellations, the same terrible default overview from 10+ years ago, a lacking(though somewhat improved) tutorial, and its very nature as a hardcore open sandbox mmo, a genre that stopped being popular... No, wait. That genre wasn't even popular to begin with.
---
No point in self repping. Anything that will hold you down long enough for a rep to be needes will kill you.
---
Classic CCP
---
Why, couldn't they still band together to take out each structure and then move on to the next?
---
who was talking about krabs?
---
They web first before pointing, they've saved me a weapons timer a few times now.
---
Sure, but they could do that before the changes too by having the orcas in an NPC corp. Also, a 500mn stabber can send an orca over 100km with one bump. Even if it doesn't keep them off your moon indefinably, it is still quit fun to watch.
---
You can increase the delay on info pop-ups.
---
or well 1
---
This happens all over the UI. Options menu, general, tooltip delay to max
---
&gt; some of the time
---
durr what is application and balance
---
Whatever it is, it wasn't one-time event.
---
https://www.adam4eve.eu/mer_region_stats_cmp.php?regions=10000002%2C10000030%2C10000032%2C10000042%2C10000043&amp;metric=imports
---
I'm guessing either someone fucked up the calculation and it never got fixed, or, it was fucked up before, and that was the fix.
---
I can imagine that there was a change in what counted as an import (i.e., if something passed through a region in the month but didn't stick around, it didn't count, etc, but I see no documentation of that)
---
&gt; It started, I think, with CODE. 
---
privateers were founded in 2007 and the first hulkageddon was in 2009, but yeah it was definetly code that got the whole highsec thing going /s
---
&gt; Nevermind that you need them 
---
players who pve while avoiding any interaction with other players devalue the efforts of higher risk play-styles. It is far from clear that the game "needs them"
---
we need popup blocker!
---
:) thanks for doing that. It's been a while.
---
I resubbed for blackout but I'm happy playing again regardless.

Not very long, do a dread instead.

You invite them to a fleet and they accept, then you fleet warp them.
---
this is a half solution, popups should be able to be fucking disabled
---
Can you remote rep back a structure while it's being attacked? 
---
If so: 
---
a) Is it during each timer or only some timers? 
---
b) Does the same remote rep-scaling from ships apply to structures?
---
yeah i'd definitely appreciate people to share my huge stash with  
---
before i overdose on them
---
So many people say S i toyo and it makes me mad
---
I blame PGL
---
You can, and I'm mad at the group my corp is with for hiding and not doing ANYTHING, 5-7 HS corps just shut down, the rest of them are in null, and we are in jspace, so war decs hardly affect us aside from making Jita runs, then we just deal with the PITA of using alpha alts in T1 haulers instead of the one guy that does Orca and DST runs.
---
I can't believe all the groups PIRATE messes with and no one ever goes out of their way to do anything back.
---
Plus their goal is normally to kill and take POCOs, so it doesn't really matter unless you can rally a defence fleet ready to take on 20 Triangle battleships in the first few days of the war. If they find a low power station that's just icing on the cake for them.
---
You're talking about emerging conduits.
---
I still haven't figured English.
---
Naw, people being unable to adapt to their safety nets being shrunk killed it. To many people called it intolerable even though its the same shit as wormholes. No local so you can't afk, that alone probably killed off half the toons, and don't say it killed off a lot of players, so many of those number drops they show are people not logging on their 10 farming alts.
---
The only thing thats really changed there is that the ore being mined is player-generated. The next step for them to avoid being killed is to just mine from an NPC corp. The same also works similarly in reverse: someone comes to mine their moon and there isn't anything they can do. You can still shoot the structure or even go as far as to block it with your own. Iirc there is some connection between either the first or second timer where you can stop them from blasting the chunk.
---
At the end of the day, the issue you describe has more to do with moon-mining in highsec than it does with any wardec changes.
---
Hard to swallow pill:  
---
Playstyles that actively avoid interaction with other people and still are able to gather up immense amount of resources/wealth should not exist
---
Wormholer btw
---
No point as such. Just nice to see another group who enjoys similar things to me. I've not really seen much similar recently but maybe I've not looked hard enough. 
---
Perhaps it came across the wrong way judging by the grumpy comments.
---
Yes quite. Everyone is entitled to enjoy their playstyle, but CCP needs to balance the rules of the sandbox such that people enjoy the playstyles that lead to a healthy game.
---
Risk averse farming and structure-based empire building are not those playstyles, because they result in no content and no fun (indeed, the farm region gameplay is about being deliberately *anti-*fun to invaders) for most other players. Farming or mining in dangerous areas, and roaming gangs (small enough to generate content for responders) are good for the game, because they add enjoyment for other players.
---
Indeed, protip.
---
Or for a modern day example look at the TTT monopoly deal. The control of the Forge market should be the single most sought after resource in the game - but in the end the entire of null came together in a big blue donut to share the takings, rather than fight over something meaningful.
---
Except there was plenty of conflict over the tech moons.  They were imbalanced as fuck, but it's hard to argue that wars weren't fought over the things.
---
&gt;they are REALLY risk and war adverse.
---
I'd define them more as optimization monsters.  If isk cost of fighting over moons &gt; peacefully existing in cartel then: existing in cartel is my best option.
---
That rush scenario is definitely a thing that could happen! These... weren't. (You can also just stop the warp sequence, or even flag exempt from fleet warp. Fleet invite acceptance is not a death sentence.)
---
Plot Twist: OP &amp; friend are different personalities in the same person

Nah that’s the usual grind. Got my second pig farm up and running recently, no clue why everyone said eve is so hard.

Thank you for confirming that you are, indeed, retarded.

This is how CCP decided to nerf anom farming income.

Exploration though? /:

Agree

I like how your response to a joke being explained for you is Naw.

&gt; everybody who doesn't wanna PvP was pushed out of the game
---
No, they just ended up recruited by the nullblobs.

I scan and bookmark anoms all day long, this doesn't happen to me.
---
I send them a convo, if they accept it and aren't salty then I tell them where they went wrong (dscan generally) and send them ISK.
---
That's not me. That's Jessica.
---
Look into Pandemic Horde. No mandatory stuff but a lot of options to learn stuff :)
---
Awesome. I did the same but this time I decided on wormholes. I used to be in HTP before you all moved to null sec and I had a lot of fun. I try to mention your vids when I can
---
Been PanFamming. Kinda took a break. Fight you in the Spire soon TM? xoxo gossipline
---
Move to your right... Click the warp button
---
When you re doing ressource-gathering/production-stuff the second you re having "player-interaction" is when things go south for you.
---
You still playing? Sounds like you have a good mind for this, and need to run for CSM again so you can goto CCP headquarters and be ignored
---
Nice. I just got an Iron farm going for the first time a few days ago so I'm tunneling down to bedrock while that runs. I think the tricky part is going to be clearing the blocks inside the staircase, I didn't count the stairs properly so it's not going to line up right.
---
&gt;...when null-sec alliance members control such a large percentage of the paid accounts.
---
Unless there has been an extreme shift, highsec has and likely continues to hold the lion's share of players in Eve. This was true even before Alpha clones. 
---
Which makes it very ironic considering how little attention they paid to highsec for so long.
---
&gt; as with a 3rd quad you're not going to be faster than 3 cycles in a vanilla
---
You can do it in 2.
---
Do you realize tgat you lose 1/3 of your total damage output against those cruisers ?
---
&gt;There are for sure alternative fits that work just fine as well.
---
I'm not really talking about "alternative fit" but a straight up better one by switching your 2nd batteryfor a mod that's actually useful.
---
You mean you do not have it installed?  Whats wrong with you?
---
I also like the change that made it impossible to wardec a corp with no vulnerable stations. I think this game is all about each player choosing their own level of risk they want to take on, and previously, I feel like there was a large gap between the risk difference of staying in an NPC corp with their high tax rate and joining a small player corp who didn't want to get into any wars but get wardec'ed anyway.
---
I used to roam in a structure ranked Thanny, it was shit tons of fun but always ended the same. Death.
---
It is... For me its just what I do when I m too tired and know exactly I d not be able to do anything else halfway successful. So why not some meditative clay-pidgeon-shooting or rock-munching and having a random chatter in local?
---
There’s consequences. They blow you up.
---
I think that there is no problem in eve classic when you already have it if you go in correct direction.         
---
Like lets be serious ... pandora box is open, even if CCP decide to create eve classic it will include incjectors.
---
Pfff... I ve gated dreads, carriers, supers, Orcas, Rorqs... Only went south and had me crying for halp in TS once in all those years...
---
Crazy you could get this many kills with how little you guys will actually undock. I would like to see some kills against a ship that can actually fight back that might be fun.

Every fitting mysteriously lacks enough PG to fit...

Chaos Era ™
---
100% agreed needs more sabre
---
Make caps more expensive and no one will ever be able to afford to challenge goon cap and supercap levels. 
---
I'm not saying they shouldn't cost more, but doing that alone would be bad for the game overall.
---
Already at max :(
---
Yooooo.  Great work.
---
People don’t generally use rattles for pvp
---
That's fantastic.
---
this is great work ! take my upvote !
---
your Gnosis draw is just wow
---
Works for me. Even on a nearly unskilled character.
---
If you meant that they are not cap-stable; they don't have to be.
---
Someone posted earlier it was because they finally have ESI integration and the kicked people were those who didn’t have ESI added.
---
You missed the joke.
---
TY, this video clarified my issue a lot.
---
Abyssals - there are tons of guides online, but the absolute best resource is the ‘abyssal lurkers’ channel in game. Join it and ask questions. 
---
Incursions - search YouTube for ‘Warp to me incursions’ for some intro videos showing how things work. The WTM website also has a newbie guide. You can also join either the WTM or TDF channels in game and ask questions. Both communities are very friendly to newbies. 
---
I can’t speak to the nullsec stuff, but I would imagine the best way to go about it is to ask your alliance. If you’re going solo, you’re probably better off not trying to PVE in nullsec unless you’re doing exploration.
---
That's amazing!
---
dont teach him about wormholes, he can be one of us
---
I think if we could do a survey of all PC gamers, everywhere, we'd discover that hundreds of thousands, maybe up to a couple *million* people have uninstalled EVE after meeting, you know, *us*.
---
MMOs are a huge market. An MMO where you can do whatever you want is the holy grail. This is an MMO where you can do whatever you want, as long as you want to fight, even in the place that's clearly marked "no fighting," or you'll get bullied out of space.
---
Pulse or beam lasers for PvE (missions mostly)
---
I know at one point scorch ruled them all, is that still true?
---
This exact same argument has been made about every single cap supremacy bloc since like lifeblood. Look at where it's gotten us.
---
Like market order pop-ups..
---
I know it's 99.4% under regional average, that's exactly why I'm trying to buy it....
---
How do you plan to support new players if you're "saving up" for a porpoise? That seems like a major red flag to me. Is your corp's name Radiant Dawn, or Radiant Dawn Inc.? There's two corps with similar names. What distinguishes your corp from others? Why should I join you over the hundreds of other random highsec mining corps?
---
Dude this happens allover the place. Click on someone on your OV and this big ass name and ship type comes up on scream making so I can't click anything else but that ship. Or pan around like an idoit trying to get the sweet spot where that ships name isn't in the fucking way. Lol. They really need to turn these things off. Sooooooo fucking annoying.
---
It's a sandbox dude
---
a) n/a
---
b) n/a
---
iam pretty sure everyone in the building I am in heard me laughing. this really made my day.
---
Nah, and one of the benefit to energy weapons is the fast ammo swap time. I use some energy weapons for pve and i'm usually using both t2 ammos, faction multif and maybe 1 or 2 mid range ammo types
---
This.. unfortunately. I almost wish there was a requirement to being a CEO. Something like the 1b for alliances.
---
Exploration by definition involves putting yourself out there for potential content, because you have to move over a wide area and will hit predictable points where you can be caught.  Yes, you avoid contact given the choice but the profession still requires you to expose yourself to content.  Contrast that with chaining ore/rat anoms at the end of a camped pipe under a super umbrella.
---
This. Supers count towards the import export stuff for some dumb reason. Probably cuz they're almost never sold on market and contracts have taxes now.
---
Ho. Ly. Shit.
---
Your voice is amazing
---
Meh, I think it's important to be able to make your 1 man corp to save on NPC taxes on missions and such, or just screw around with your friends. I do think that it's somewhat unethical to say you're new-player friendly when you can't actually support them though.
---
It just bothers me that everyone and there mother thinks they can run a Corp.. Soo many shitty hs corps that are simply tax Haven's or alt homes.. hell I've got A newbro I've been talking to for a week or so now. He keeps asking me about moving to this Corp or that Corp because some recruiter talked to them. These are 5to 10 man corps and I know everything starts somewhere but... Idk tangent I guess lol.
---
Great,  now I want that lazer raven...
---
Dope.
---
👌
---
Were that the case, it would be an uneven regional effect, and wouldn't be consistent in every MER since.  It's not super fleet movements.
---
But if 95% of the players like it that was and would leave if it was taken away then arguably it isn't bad. Because the game would die without it. 
---
Only ccp has these stats, if they are able to interpret them is another thing.
---
Hey I didn't read the data. But more often than not when export/imports don't make sense the reason is super movements. But hey I don't even have one so what do I care :P
---
Cool, but between pulses and beams, which are generally considered better?
---
&lt;3 amazeballs Geo!
---
Radiant Dawn Inc. We are in high sec. And that's on you if you want something random. We help ours. This is more family then it is a Corp. You need knowledge on something. Help with anything we are there for each other.
---
Did that statistic account for highsec market characters? I may live in null, but over half my toons are in highsec. Doesn't mean I'm a highsec player though
---
And there is 0 tax in this Corp.
---
That's nice of you to say, thanks.
---
That's our main focus is to help Newbros and returning players get there l their bearings in game.
---
Mate your work is impressive
---
Are any of them for sale?
---
&gt;But if 95% of the players like it that was and would leave if it was taken away then arguably it isn't bad. Because the game would die without it.  
---
  
---
you're missing a word:
---
**remaining** players  
---
and this is a key difference. just because it's what people think they want, doesn't necessarily mean it's good for the ecosystem of  the game. right now eve is cooking up a perfect storm of stagnation and player burnout.
---
if a random kid comes into your sandbox, takes a huge dump at each corner and then sits at the center doing nothing, I'm pretty sure you'd say that the kid is not exactly "good" player to have in your sandbox. Justification of "it's a sandbox dude" is pretty meh tbh, I do agree that gamesystems themselves should encourage players to interact with each other, but idk man if you really like PvE so much, there's other games that do it muuuch better and are much more fun
---
it's not just that the playstyle damages interaction, arguably the most important aspect of an mmo - it's that the particular playstyle, maximum defensive posturing, mass accumulation of material, is *viable and encouraged by current nullsec meta* and the really shitty thing is that now that we're this far into eve's life cycle following the downward trend beginning around 2016, it's going to be very hard for ccp to do anything about it without people just ragequitting, especially since it's already worked in short order when it came to blackout.
---
Laughs in PvP rattlesnake
---
I'll give it a try. Do you happen to have a video that has the 2 cycle in it?
---
Sigh. He can just gate it around if he’s looking to PvP in it solo
---
Content is content... If you tell them to leave, pretty soon there won't be anyone left to play with...
---

---
Please forgive the colors (they're literally random right now) and lack of polish; I've basically got the graphs working and then noticed this. The project itself is more about learning and practicing UI development, but since CCP was kind enough to provide the data (and I like eve) that's the story so far!
---
in hindsight this is why i stopped playing
---
Yep, still logging in, undocking, and doing something at least once a week. 
---
Sometimes being on the CSM feels like an uphill battle, and we're really not much more than a focus group so CCP ultimately is going to do what they want. Despite the difficulties I do believe the game is in a better place than it would be if the CSM did not exist.
---
lol a hisec carebear and his newbs
---
Solo carrier is easily the worst ship to be alone in. It takes 3-5 of basicly anything to defang you and then you just sorta sit there until either you get saved or they kill you. Which ever comes first.  It's so easy infact that we should have tournaments to see who can do the best t1 subcap fits with 3-5 people to kill a carrier in record time.
---
How long have you been playing? Why join you over eve university? If you can't even pay for a 60m hull what hope do you have of supporting newbros? 
---
I know I probably sound like an asshole I'm just sick of shitty hs corps. I've been looking for some friendly miners to work with for years but they never seem to stick or even have any idea what they're product is worth.. 
---
I'm glad to see people trying to help newbros but if you can't support yourself how do you support them.
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
I mean the main problem is CCP has no clear goal on what to do. They hate huge powerblocs so they roll out fozziesov, then they do citadels which makes entrenched powers harder than ever to root out. They hate capital spam, but then they add DDA and drone omnis which results in capital blobs being essentially invulnerable barring huge unforced errors are the two powerblocs directly fighting. They then want to nerf capital spam and change fighter mechanics, but rorquals drastically increase the mining rate, and citadels extremely simplify the process to manufacture and store supercaps. Also added Aoe DDs back in ???
---
During this they have nearly lost the entire playerbase that was strictly pve. Pve is now almost entirely a means to an end. There are no miners that mine because they're pure industrialists. They mine to stock up on more supers.
---
The only kind of good analogue to how pvp (hunting) happens in eve is in dark souls. People enjoy invading in dark souls because they get to stalk and hunt down another player, however you don't run out of people to invade because the pve portion of the game is fun and the risk of other players just makes it exciting. The pve in eve fucking sucks and is two full decades out of date.
---
Actually incursions were fun, but you could only reliably do them in hisec. Just lol that the one group pve activity is pretty awful to do in nullsec. Its possible to do but fuck it requires a lot of effort and constant moving.
---
It even has the piss cloud of the exploded hi sec war decced Orca pilot who couldn't align out fast enough.  Bravo sir.
---
Theres always one...
---
Thanks Ken :)
---
My last account got locked do to email issues. But I've been playing since May 6th of 2003.
---
I'm a returning player and this account is about 3 years old. Most of the Newbros here are about a week old.
---
Check the facebook page out
---
I hate it especially in your inventory...
---
That's not CCP there is no helmet and water wings on that kid!
---
And we help each other learn. Not just Indy but exploration aswell. And if you're interested in security then that's my forte.
---
Tell him to go to Amarr and see the titans there
---
Buy cheapest in LS. Buy all your fittings in Jita/Amarr/wherever. Bring your fit into your WH from Jita. Park it there. Wait for exit near the LS with your Carrier. Fly out of WH, fit it, fuel it and jump it to another region you want to be in. Or base out of that same region and fly around that space. However, it is likely if it was sold there, people will then be looking for it there.
---
If you aren't in a WH... Flying a transport into LS for your carrier shouldn't be too terrible. T2 fit the carrier, plan to PVP in it and lose it, but make sure it is insured. Much faster to just take the risk and fly into LS.
---
Devs don't play EvE so these rage-inducing popups don't bother them.
---
So you and your alts don't mind that you and your alts are in corp? :D
---
Ah!! I misunderstood what people were complaining about then sorry haha, being in a ship that can stay cloaked 99.999999% of the time, and having my cloaking skill at V I almost never deal with pvp minus the occasional gate camp! But you’re entirely correct I am technically putting myself out there, just haven’t been found yet!
---
I've been here since 2012 ish maybe it's 2013. Idk but a long time.
---
Talk to ccp you can probably get your original back
---
What do you plan to offer them? How do you plan to "support" them. Even ignoring isk costs. Teaching them dosent require a Corp.
---
Idk maybe I'm being to hard on you. I'll message you in game some time. *Probably tmw or later today not at my PC* 
---
I run a class 2 / hs Corp so maybe we can help each other.
---
Forcing every newbro into nullblocs and "optimal" isk/hr ratting so they can fly doctrine f1 ships is why they have problems retaining new players. The NPE should be about finding the joy and wonder of the world, being shot at by randos on gates in lowsec and barely getting away, meeting another venture chewing up veldspar in a .9 system and making a friend and venturing into the "spooky" high sec that have belt rats so you guys can help each other fight em off, getting a cruiser for the first time after a few weeks of playing and feeling fucking invincible, until you whelp it to a guy after you accidentally looted his wreck, those types of experiences are what made us all love eve. Not the fact that we were shoved into a faction cruiser on day 20 and orbited rock havens for long enough to afford a muninn. having the fact that something that is suboptimal isnt worth doing at all drilled into the heads of newbies is more damaging to retention than any amount of citadel spam or sov mechanics or whatever else I see people bitching about on here.
---
No, he was talking about emerging conduits. As evidenced by mentioned a 4.5 m payout.
---
When I started eve I thought I was being smart in docking up with a pod. Getting a noobship. Taking the 1 trit out. Undock and leave ship. And then starting again. 
---
Didn't take me that long to realise it wasn't that good isk.
---
Never recorded myself doing it but it's almost the same fitting sequence you do.
---
Land, Drop depot, Jetison the gun, as soon as you've refit to full dps, you can start smart bombing.
---
Fast forward to cruiser wave, put your hexas in your jetison can and fit your quads.
---
How effin naive can one "respected" player/leader in eve get?
---
I complain about this a lot, but isk isn't the problem for new players, skill points are.  The career agents introduce basically every form of hi-sec krabbing, and yea krabbing in hi-sec is awful, but it does the job of teaching the new player what they need to do to make isk.  Hell, what you learn there doesn't fundamentally change in null either, it's just potentially* more dangerous.  There's not much left for you to teach a new player who has done the career agents unless you're willing to go really in-depth with technique, which will be wasted if you don't put it on a drip feed.  The biggest issue is just that isk making in hi-sec isn't rewarding until you get to Incursions, and running people through the same info they've already heard doesn't fix that (unless they forget something, of course).
---
We hear a lot about the NPE with the implication that the UI is driving people away.  Maybe the UI kills some new players.  I didn't have much of a problem getting used to it, at least not to the point of it preventing me from "falling in love with this game," but I do keep finding out about hidden, helpful UI features that were never explained.  However, I don't think anyone who is going to "fall in love with the game" is driven away by the UI, particularly since the player attrition time-frame CCP talks about spans a couple of months rather than the couple of hours it takes to say "I hate this UI."
---
So, why skill points?  I'm getting close to the "cut-off" where CCP says they've lost 90% of new players (I think they said it was around 6 months).  While I've only played for a couple months, between the starting skills, new player invite code, and SP events I'm sitting at around 4 months worth of SP on each of my three accounts (I'd say I "fell in love with the game" around week 2).  Despite checking skill queues and updating market orders, I've barely actually played for the last couple weeks.  It's not that I can't do anything, I can keep krabbing until I quit the game, but to get to the point where I can do anything new I need to wait for several skills that take a week or longer to train on every character.  I know a week is relatively short in comparison to many skill training times, but every week I don't do more than log in to queue skills is one week I am closer to not logging in again.
---
As a new player, I'm stuck in a loop where I'm not krabbing so I can fly bigger or better ships.  I'm not even krabbing so I can fly ships that let me krab harder.  I'm krabbing so I can buy skill points to train skills that let me fly ships that let me krab harder to buy more skill points so I can unlock... anything else to do.  The other, less insane alternative is to wait.  Sure I can krab while I wait, but I don't want to krab, I've spent a few hundred hours doing it already and I no longer enjoy it nor feel like the goals I'm grinding for are close enough to bother.  So I wait, and hope that the skills I chose to train will eventually let me do something interesting.  In the meantime, I play other games and get one day closer to giving up on Eve.
---
Well personally I’m not a fan of citadel spam in general, in FW space or otherwise, having 1 structure in a system gives something to fight over, an objective and point of conflict, having several breaks a lot of the “new” FW mechanics. 
---
Back before May 2013 we could dock just fine in enemy FW stations, and in many respects the time from 2009 to 2013 was the glory days of FW, it’s at least the time with the highest activity numbers by far. Plexes were contested by fleets and not the whole afk and avoidance of fighting meta that came after, although that seems finally to be changing somewhat.
---
I agree with you that FW needs to be looked at again, its been a fantastic start for many a player career of a lot of people, me included, spent 3-4 years there. I just think it needs to have a complete overhaul, and that some of the changes from the last 5-6 years might not actually have been for the better.
---
good 3 offers.
---
You need someone at the wheel before you need a roadmap
---
the only downside to blackout was that the 1/3 of players that left didn't give me their loot first.
---
In Soviet Russia, the game develops CCP
---
&gt; And that's on you if you want something random.
---
You still haven't really described what your corp is/does in a way that distinguishes it from highsec rocksucker corp #3524. You haven't addressed the point of why you feel you can run a corp that can properly support new players if you can't buy a freaking porpoise, regardless of your account age. Having 0 tax says to me that your corp has no real direction or services. If your corp has no funds, you're just a couple dudes with a private chat channel.
---
Also, you can edit your comments. You don't need to post multiples.
---
This is marvelous
---
Net Imports fluctuating like that wouldn't surprise me (depends on total volume), but the total imports change tells me there was an accounting change of some kind. Unfortunately I don't know what it was, but universal movements like that on a scale that would have definitely been noticed by pretty much everyone. 
---
One thing to look at might be to see if:
---
A - any other stats (isk velocity, production, destruction) also fluctuated at a similar time or not.
---
B - See if this event matches a trend with other similar events (like the one Tsedd linked below). One of those fluxes may have an explanation tied to it.
---
Also, it seems strange that a drastic change like this would occur and not appear on those reports (or be mentioned).
---
AAR - Over past two days multiple timers. The fort in BOZ was heavily contested by Fraternity, and was one of the better non tidi structure fights I have had in a while, (Followed a escalation path etc). They proceeded to let the I-9 fort go. The next day for the tat and the two sotiyos they formed but their numbers were not there, so they jumped mangos as mangos headed up the path to the sotiyo, we pursued until they ran after a few exchanges. Proceeded to leave the stoyio and the tatara undefended. The EIH Keepstar also got reinforced today.
---
done just for you
---
evrytime i undock i see duel popup..evrytime i  warp to gate i get duel popup..and blocked people still talk on local in jita,they are on block list but still they scam.
---
wait when you get credit card number demand popup xD

What happened to that kid? I missed everything after he started getting popular here.

I would legit buy this,  what Im saying is.... you should take commissions

I see Juan and I upvote
---
If they're going to get upset and quit over losing a few million to an NPC then EVE isn't the game for them.
---
are we even trying anymore
---
Ok, I actually managed to find it [Active Character Locations in EVE](https://imgur.com/a/KOdub) from [this Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/4irqlp/whats_the_breakdown_between_highlownullwh_players/)
---
It says it counts active characters, so that definitely includes some alts. 
---
That being said, just under 75% of characters were in highsec. If you try to extrapolate out from there you get some crazy numbers for alts. Not many of which would match up with other stats CCP have released on alts and player activity. Hell, just open the map and swap between "Pilots in Space" and "Pilots Docked" throughout a day and you'll definitely see highsec is seems much less barren than null. 
---
It also matters how the data was collected. Does an alt I use occasional weight as much as my main? I don't know how the data was counted, I'd probably have to watch the presentation again and see if it was mentioned.
---
Regardless, highsec population is massive. Easily larger than any other single area of space. At worst it is a very close second to all others combined. 
---
Of course, that graph is about 4 years old and it could have changed significantly. However, looking back on how big some changes to eve were and the number was still that high, I wouldn't put any single thing that has happened since then as being significant enough to drop it below 65% at worst. Especially considering that the years since then have probably seen highsec getting much more attention and new content than ever before. Not much in comparison to what other areas of space may have gotten, but much more than before.
---
That is a sweet nos though. Can totally shut down those pesky Rapiers.
---
Got an example fit I could see? Would be interested in testing that out.
---
Very nice
---
Im sorry do you have a issue with people that suffer from Autism?

Correct.  Misunderstood question.

You know Ive been itching to try the Eos for years but haven't felt I could do it justice, maybe with the cyno cuanges I'll give one a whirl

I have started portrait commissions but i've always had a problem with commission work, Its like I can never really relax and get the best out of it. 
---
In the end its an artists dream to just paint what they feel to and make a living out if it but its extremely hard

An Orca ferrying goods under the rings of a gas giant!
---
Orca are one of the best looking ships in the game, makes me sad when I see them just sitting around HS moons with mining drones instead of being the center of a whole mining fleet.
---
But I can’t talk, all I use mine for is moving stuff.
---
That is a stunning capture. Well done ☺️
---
Definitely missing the point. It's the carebears/krabs who lobbied CCP continuously to nerf PvP and make resource gathering easier. They file frivolous harassment petitions and demand to be left alone. If anyone is intolerant of other playstyles it is them. They cast the first stone and are actively attempting to kill the game.
---
Couldnt agree more. But I think you meant to reply to the same guy I replied to. Lol I find it hard to believe that there's hundreds of accounts that only explo and never attempt to defend themselves. You CAN do explo in a combat astero, but that would actually require manual inputs from a human player. So I agree they are all mostly bots.

omg
---
*Cries in Gallente*
---
Improve your PG skills
---
This is something I'd expect to see out of Elite: Dangerous! Beautiful shot!
---
The balance there is high sec moon isnt worth shit. Ice mining is more profitable.
---
Trafficked into a Disney role, quickly graduated to Dan Snyder Sex Parties. Tragically common with young stars.
---
The default overview being beyond trash is just emergent gameplay tho ok
---
LOL
---
Don't do it unless you have enough ISK that losing it won't be much of a problem for you. Operating a capital ship on your own is like playing Dark Souls; if you do it, *prepare to die.*
---
I just did this last week. It was easy and everything copied over.
---
Unless a certain playstyle has massive economic externalities.
---
That wouldn't be an expensive corp event either.
---
I used mine as a mobile home actually. Still the same ole Orca a friend whos only in EVE every now and then by now built for me and I mined for endless hours in my single Procurer in HS...  
---
Just pack some mining boats and some basic blueprint-copies for stuff you ll need in it and you re good to go for EVE-gypsie-life :)
---
The only way classic eve would be fun is if none of us knew how to play again.
---
Can I get one?
---
Yeah, and then see polarized Torp-bombers with all lows and mids filled with damage mods... Wouldnt that be "fun" -.-
---
I hope they are green tears!
---
If 95% of the players don’t want to interact with other players and just stroke themselves all day, what good is this game?
---
a 6/10 shot (ha) which i'd rather see in r/eveporn, even though this is probably better than 95% of the shit that gets posted here
---
note: it's actually a 7/10 but i'm not one to miss a numerical pun
---
Sure. Bads get caught too.
---
Typically the invite astra is in line with the undock so you have one tick after accepting invite to cancel warp or flag exempt before it is too late.
---
Too soon
---
They e been working on it for a while. Probably took some time to weed through the shit fits.
---
Goons approach things a little differently. They play at high level galactic domination and the metagame. From their perspective it's naive to piss around in highsec doing L1s all alone. EVE is a team-based PvP game, so you get your ass straight to your team in nullsec, and focus on generating ISK as quickly and as passively as possible with as many alts as possible so you can be rich and capable enough to ship into whatever the Leader requires, ideally a Titan with fax alts.
---
How would you feel if you acquired 0 isk from it? Would you still krab?
---
That’s a nice Orca you got there...
---
Good report.
---
Nice.  
---
When I think of a Myrmidon, I don’t think of a watercolor, but you changed my mind.  
---
Well done.
---
Amazing. We are not worthy!
---
What a bunch of sad pussies.
---
&gt; I can't believe all the groups PIRATE messes with and no one ever goes out of their way to do anything back.
---
AFAIK, they do. Word at AMC has it there was a massive fleet of about 140 ships reinforced one of their structures a couple of weeks ago because they had ticked so many people off.
---
Thing is, P I R A T is *very* well-funded because their whole schtick is making money by any (violent) means available to them. They'll do gatecamps, take mercenary contracts, anything that pads their wallets and lets them blow shit up is fair game. They have more than enough resources to keep warring with everyone in hisec for a long time to come.
