What's even dumber is that the 48h window means that if you really want to tryhard for a free fanfest trip you're going to end up sitting in your hotel room with your partner practicing instead of, you know, actually enjoying the eve event that you're paying to attend. 
---

---
Should make it at least a week before or just not announce ships at all until the event starts. 
---
problem is, that you more and more restrict them to powerblock use that way, who need them only for attacks as they can defend their larger structures; smaller groups in for example npc null either paint targets on their backs by deploying large structures, or deploy mediums to have a reasonable infrastructure for their production; even then, every job that takes more than a day is taking a risk, as aborting jobs also deletes the raw materials, and that stuff doesn't get asset safety either

Tbh there should be some kind of "max inactive time" before your name is up for grabs and you are renamed to something generic with a "you can change your name token"

This is a mechanic a lot of games, that doesn't allow more people having the same name have

Rorq on the Ping and 1 Rorq in the Belt cyno up, Frat caps and Titans come in, alot of shooting commences, 2 Rorqs die in the fight, 1 corm fleet gets bombed and a few caps eat torps. Then we extract."

Thanks for the fun, Pandas. Next time bring more titans. :)

GSF does not control the members of TNT. That would be like folks harrassing Darkness. for Ranger Regiment botters

That actually looks pretty cool tbh.

Blueballed again :(

Thanks CCP, I’m excited to see how far y’all can push the game on 64bit client!  Just need to find a way to get some new blood into the game.
---
Wew lad

Keep telling yourself that

Yeah, he's new to nullsec, is hearing impaired rl, and didn't know the best way to transport stuff. He laughed his ass off about it when I told him way easier ways to transport shit!
---
My issue is that they clearly *do* have not-insignificant resources available to them. This Invasion series requires them to run 7 different signup pages, 64-team brackets, bracket predictions, thunderdome access, and rulesets/ships. It also involves paying for a free Iceland trip for 14 different people (not cheap!) as well as handling the broadcasting side of things for a live event which is always going to be more challenging than an online-only one. 
---
The AT is not perfect but blaming its hiatus on lack of resources feels a little disingenuous when they seem to have created 7 times the amount of work for themselves with this series. 
---
I have hg ascendency implants and do hel ratting for 130-140m isk per tick, we have someone who rats with a Ragnarok extremely hardcore with maxed DD skills and pulls in almost 540m per hour. He pays in taxes to the Corp what I make hel ratting each month (30b+). but I'm only risking 36b in space and he's risking around 80b.
---
Keep in mind he has to buy an absolute ton of fuel for his boson DD but that barely offsets the difference, just one more thing for him to worry about to keep up that level of income.

That was awesome. I had time to get another Sabre and we still held the field.

A hole new way of cloaking.

I'm 21 and I think this is stupid

is LadyScarlet having some kind of attack while writing that

That guy who claims they won the field just got lucky our ts connection dropped so while everyone switching comms and whatnot he warped out in his nyx.

The Rag warped in just to show he had a titan.
---
There are new abyssal space PvE options that allow you to challenge yourself and experience some decent randomness. I personally don’t feel that anything has been added to change pve besides that really (nothing worth while that is). If you do want to PvP that area of the game is alive and kicking and you could find a lot of fun in it
---
Can someone please tell LadyScarlet that discord has an edit function?
---
Thankyou, a little bit obsessed, it is the weekend here and I'm a bit busy at home but I'm logged and coming back and forth from the computer jumping around trying to get to lowest sec areas. I find Eve pretty relaxing compared to the toxic Pvp scene in Gw2. After I blew up my second ship I actually had a moment while Metallica's Orian  was playing in my headphones and just thought, this game is beautiful &lt;3  I even look up at night IRL at the stars and think , " I wonder if this is all actually happening up in space somewhere. " xD

Everything that’s in highsec is in low and null sec. Also, the large industries are out there. Can’t tell me Goons don’t know what they’re talking about when it comes down to manufacturing and Indy.

Stick to solo cause your fleets only know how to feed

tbh goons &gt; tnt :D

tnt is the low skill groupe in cfc

---
Yes.
---
The short range DPS &gt; long range DPS standard for turret types is reversed for lasers.
---
That means the advantage of pulses is flexibility (cough scorch) and tracking rather than the dps of blasters.
---
It took my quite a while to realise this too.
---
It's particularly interesting on frigates as it can make for some very high dose scram kiters 
---
Best part for me is the link is active shielding and not extension.

VOIP isn't the most reliable thing ever, nor are people the most reliable listeners ever. The practice of "talk fast and repeat yourself a shitton-online" has been a proven method of getting your point across to people who are probably watching some dirty video on the other monitor while anchored
---
Yeah. Some frigate modules are nice, but the odds of having a 100m deadspace mod drop instead of a cheap overseers mod + garbage isn't in your favor. Consider that 6/10s and 10/10s can drop more desirable stuff worth over a bil and you can see why people don't hunt HiSec DEDs that often. 
---
It's still better than doing regular HiSec anoms or regular L4 missions, but that's not saying much. 
---

LS already has plenty of missions, including L5s which HS doesn't have. The main reason why PvE HS players don't go do them is ship fits. The content requires ship fits which are complete garbage for PvP thus leaving you with only 1 option. Avoid it because its a guaranteed death sentence.
---
This aspect of things will not change for as long as this holds true. You can put incredible rewards in it, and people will still avoid it due to the guaranteed deaths in conflict due to the ships / fits, game mechanics.
---
Last time CCP said it was 70% actually, but that was a while ago now so it may not be current.
---
And we even have a compendium thread where we link all of the z0r chain threads for your convenience! 
---
aren't kikis the best ))
---
Dunno. I have heard that the majority of players are still in highsec, but it really all comes down to how long a player has been inactive before they stop counting him. And a casual who mines veldspar on weekends doesn't really count as a full player.
---
Just start one on your PC and 1 on tour laptop. And that is not illegal since its still 1 alpha client per machine.
---
VMs are a different story, I do not understand why they don't build a basic OS check into the client. Plenty of apps out there that require an actual OS and can tell if they are within a VM. No idea why this one can't be one of them.
---
tommorow

Downvoted as requested.
---
&gt;Lanngisi 
---
is the best one,  lowest true sec system means highest payouts, and the unique constellation layout means low travel time.  
---
Apanake is okay, but I'd only use it if you have minmatar standings problems, and then move once you do enough SoE storylines you can go to lanngisi.  Osmon,  well it just isn't worth going there.  you are better off finding a different corp to mission for. 
---
Mission running is NOT a hisec only activity. 
---
The MANY billions I made in Stain making and selling high grade slave implant sets by running lvl4 Samsha Missions say otherwise.
---
At 3b each for 6-8 hours work,  that's better than most titan ratting (375-500m/hr)
---
Question: which battleships are best for the solo pvp vs gang type of playstyle? Also is it useful to equip a burst jammer to reduce dps ? If yes which one is better the burst jammer  or the gurista spectral jammer thing?
---
As someone who won EVE and still keeps devoting precious seconds to Reddit - this is the community I've been playing with last X years. It is not possible just to turn _them_ off and pretend this community doesn't exist anymore. Some people can do that, the majority cannot.
---
It's quite weird to advertise EVE as a group game, where long lasting friendships are being formed etc etc, and then pretend those people don't matter.
---
mission loot blows hard, I'd yell at the gurista's ratters. 
---
A few folk spammed his channel in Amarr (how I found it). Someone then got a bee in their bonnet and made a Reddit post about him RMTing and botting (no proof of either), which got him a massive amount of publicity. Since he gives away a fair whack of stuff, a chunk of the folk who came following the whiff of potential drama stuck around, because who doesn't like free shit?
---
He doesn't normally have the BRB screen up that long, usually stuff is happening. Mostly mining, industry, ratting, or whatever with random chat, so will be boring to those who like the F1-centric channels, but I find them boring, so preferences be preferences.
---
He does also tend to cover times that a lot of the other PVE streamers don't, so he gets run in the background while I'm playing, because all my other followed channels are offline. I'll be honest, I frequently start the stream like that, get distracted, and leave it running when I go to sleep. And think because of him crossing optimal times for various timezones, a fair few do the same (has been some hilarious instances of giveaway draws being rerolled repeatedly because loads have gone to sleep/afk before the draw!). Hardly his fault if some of his view count comes from semi-active people, but yeah, will bump the numbers a bit.
---
So yeah, just advertising from people in game, then Reddit posts like this, coupled with generous giveaways and under-utilised timezone choices. I've been watching the past couple weeks and yet to see anything indicative of untoward activity either regarding the game or the stream. Originally he offered points for bits/donations, which could have been interpreted as RMT under the very vague rules, but as soon as that was pointed out, he removed it and admitted he hadn't realised it might be considered that, and that was before the surge of interest so not like he got much of a chance to utilise it even unintentionally. 
---
TL;DR - He might not be your cup of tea, but seems legit. Made a mistake leaving the stream running when AFK and got a 24 ban from Twitch, but humans be human, and it's threads like this that are actually contributing to the view count, not view-botting or anything dodgy.
---
Funny you mention it because half the CSM being goons &amp; pets only illustrates this joke called "player representation"
---
OMG people dare to present their opinions REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Why tf is that titan carrying excavator drones???

(Soon) Welcome back to the real life mate!

---
You can't inject experience.
---
Then you have dummy's like me who assume we're talking about something different (using alts to "view" other systems in eve, in this case) and didn't think to google it. 
---
Actually pretty good ideas. This way you have an 'established front' and more people will concentrate in one area to have fights.
---
The 64 bit client is twice as many bits as the 32 bit client so EVE 2.0 should be out this year
---
Make blowing them up more rewarding so that small groups can actually do it for profit.
---
Citadels get cleaned out reasonably quick in wormholes for that reason.
---
with 2 spaces allowed these days there are plenty of good names to be had
---
How long is a tick, also, is the money from ratting from loot or bounty’s or salvage?
---
As far from the truth as you could possibly get, but ok.
---
Different rats drop different types of mods though, in line with their faction.
---
Wrong. You can't just double bits, you need to increase pieces as well.
---
Capital jumping, specifically bridging. 
---
When I first started playing travelling from drone regions to Dek or something took hours, even with gate bookmarks (I earned billions selling full bm sets). 
---
Force projection was a challenge, with any group that wanted to move or invade having to commit heavily. 
---
Now you can cross the entire galaxy in a few minutes, bringing your entire alliance with you. It has the upside of making it easier to war with others, but the downside of making the size of the map irrelevant, and the wonder of scale has completely gone, which is something I loved. 
---
they should bluff people into thinking it's going to happen, so a ton of isk gets sunk into skillbooks by those wealthy vets rather than newbies
---
There's free typing teaching software online
---
We just enjoy watching the leader of a pve alliance get salty.
---
You're like brisc, but at least he knows he's not leadership 
---
There is no difference between trading on an alpha account vs an omega account when it comes to how much you are getting for your items. Skills will effect those and alpha accounts have locked in skill barriers to keep them in check. If you sold a thing on an alpha account with minimal skills for 100m you would get your 100m. Same thing on an omega account.
---
So they didn't have control of the grid at the end of the battle? Those filthy liars!
---
OK, you are flying completely and utterly junk fit for fire. You need to go active. A-type invuln, a-type med rep, large thukker battery, at least a b-type AB, 3x faction DDAs with augmented hammers. For fire augmented hammers are the meat and potatoes. Make sure that you have a bare minimum 90 HPS (more is better) just of off your shield rep alone all the while it remains cap stable.
---
Your DPS is extremely low and on top of that you aren't even using thermal damage drones in a thermal filament. If your ship, just ship by itself, no boosters, can't do minimum 900 DPS then you will not make it through the 20 minute timer a lot of times because you'll get stuck on battleship spawns. NPCs have double armor in fire filaments.
---
As for you running it on Sisi, sounds like you just got spawn lucky, thats all.
---
i've had thin mints once and although i typically avoid anything with "mint" in it they were actually ok, duno about the other stuff

Wait what, what changes that you can't?

what kind of girl scout cookies?

It allows more memory to be utilized 
---
If you ever get the itch to PVP, I'm located in lowsec and don't mind a neut noob in my fleet if they're here to help and learn :)
---
Okay, tbf that's some logic I can support
---
Damn, I haven't seen a GTFO fit since the last time ProGod complained about them. 
---
go back far enough and there were all kinda of spitballed ideas
---
like at one point it was just going to be about replacing POSes, and there was a tinkertoy concept that had illustrations where you'd add modules together and it would look like the various deadspace constructions that CCP makes for NPCs.
---
then a segment of the playerbase pressured CCP into station destruction. which meant that POS replacement and new player stations got rolled together into one project. serving two needs like that is where a lot of the stuff that people hate now comes from -- citadels are spammable because entry level POSes were cheap. asset safety exists because you could never lose stuff from stations. making a single thing that fit both goals wasn't possible.
---
station destruction was a stupid thing to ask for and I'm glad it backfired as hard as it did on those who wanted it most
---
Ok

Man, I just read empires of eve and would love to hear some of those stories too.

Depends on your playstyle, for solo vs gang u want max tank and max cap, definitely no burst stuff. Rattles, Barghests, Vindicators are usually what is used.
---
12 mins left, want my 20b. 
---
Fuck she's a Bitch!!!
---
I don't say that to be mean I have always tried to give the enemy a little respect, but damn that was subhuman as fuck.
---
/u/materall Seriously please tell me if this was a troll. I need to know and I'm not kidding.
---
From the T1 line-up, I'd say the Hyperion stands a shoulder above the rest with its massive local tank. You can generally sustain gang DPS while scram/webbing targets one by one and blasting into them with over 1,000 DPS. If they refuse to get into scram range, just MJD out. 
---
There's also a number of faction options to choose from - the Machariel and Bhaalgorn probably stand out the most. The Machariel has excellent speed and can fit either an armor or shield tank, and the bhaalgorn has the supremely useful neut and web bonus, both of which are a huge help in gang fights. 
---
Word of warning though - most people know what to expect with these ships and might not engage you without overwhelming numbers on their side. Consider something unorthodox such as an ASB Raven or a hull-tanked Dominix for the  element of surprise and appearance of engageability. 
---
Don't equip a burst jammer - if you're shield tanked you lose a lot of tank that way, and if you're armor tanked you lose utility (extra web or prop mod). 
---
Obvious Olmeca\_Gold posting account is obvious.

it's because of this kind of post we feel we are the best and trust me average goons line member don't even know how to align to a gate

While it may have been actually far from the truth,  basic frigs out in null scream 'bait', and few things are as frustrating as greeting blasted by a 20 man hour drop fleet that you can do nothing against.... The lack of talking is a bit rude though.

It was fun kicking her sandcastle though.
---
&gt;It seems like every day I play this game I run into Goonswarm members autistically screeching about how they are the best at the game, how everyone else sucks, etc.

Goons come straight into GE- every few days for fights and they aren't like that in my experience. They also leave lots of delicious salvage all over the place as well.

Give me the 20 billion isk.

---
Hewathrn, thin mints 4 life
---
For once a wholesome post I can get behind
---
I, too, make assertions without evidence, nerd.
---
Posting at 27 mins ill taje your bet
---
Ok I had to do it :
---
&gt; 1) They have set up a botting empire. While I do realize that not every single Goonswarm member is a botter, it would be foolish to say that they do not welcome botters in with open arms. Of course, when it becomes obvious that a corp is populated by botters Goonswarm takes action (think TNT the other day). By harnessing the power of bots they have built their alliance to the point it is currently at (after all who can compete versus hundreds of rorquals mining 23 hours a day in terms of sheer economic output).
---
The guy reported on a reddit post was reported having 3 other corp in 4 different alliance (source (something you should learn to do btw) https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/aupgzf/mineclub_anatomy_of_a_botting_corporation/)  : Rate My Ticks [RMT] PL renter setup in tribute, Red alliance currently member of a newly russian coalition fighting FRT in south east (no more imperium before you throw your salt) and "rent company" I let you check the original post to understand the quote (it's my way to check if you are in denial or try to gather information).
---
&gt; 2) They have taken advantage of CSM privileges to push their agenda forward. While not technically against the rules, this is against the spirit of the game. Goonswarm and company account for around half of the members of the annual CSM group. As a member of this group they receive inside information about the future of the game that allows them to better position themselves and their alliance for future success.
---
As it's well known, when someone is giving you an information of what's going on inside CCP mind, you must be 5+ to understand the information... Or maybe not, GOTG and PL have a CSM member there, I don't think they need to be more to listen what CCP is saying or are you insulting some CSM ? Also, have you ever heard about NDA ? Again, I let you check wikipedia for this my way of blablabla
---
&gt; ​
---
3) Some members of Goonswarm use their positions as moderators on this subreddit to instantly silence any criticism of their alliance. Olmeca was not lying when he said that moderator abuse on behalf of Goonswarm is an issue. I have had countless posts be deleted with zero explanation for the mods. Coincidentally these posts all highlighted the issues with the rampant botting in Goonswarm among other things. In fact I'd be willing to bet 20 billion ISK that this post is pulled down within 30 minutes of posting.

Same moderator also receive from their own alliance member "you are biased", using Olmeca as an example is really really bad, Olmeca is the kind of guy doing personal harassment and 1 week later complaining about goons mocking his booshing skills, he is also the kind of guy saying he was ban by Goons moderator for no reason while in fact, was ban because he was spamming the mod mail with some cringy bitching as stated here : https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/avenen/itt_isolationist_metagaming_and_predatory_reddit/ehej6yi/ But I guess you made your own research right ?
---

4) They made way too big of an alliance. In almost any fight against Goonswarm you are going to be severely outnumbered. This is because they alone are an alliance with 35,000 members (according to DOTLAN). Out of the top 11 alliances by population, 6 are allied with Goonswarm. By adding up the numbers on DOTLAN you can see that between 2/3 to 3/4 of the Sov controlling alliance population belongs to Goonswarm. While this does include alts, you would be a fool to believe that anybody has the numbers to contend.
---
​I just love using this example : https://zkillboard.com/related/30001967/201808011900/ X47, huge Imperium victory.... while being outnumber, Goonswarm Federation is not really an elite alliance who ask their member to leave their PVE alts out of their corp, or kick inactive people often, for example Karmafleet ask 1 pap per 3 month, Goonswarm is fill with afk people, 35k on paper almost 3k log in prime time it's still a good number for sure, but the Imperium, thanks to WWB, reform under 1 flag a lot of our allies merge with us, but well I'm not going to teach you "How Goonswarm boom over the last 3 years" you would consider this spinning and I would have to throw the "Goonswarm was almost dead and yet no one decide to deploy south for the last 3 (now 4 ?) years and now you complain we grow ? huh".

I mean there's a huge gulf between setting up a server, a set of rules, in-game art resources and GM resources for a month-long tournament and a google doc for a bunch of drunk dudes with prefit ships
---
BOT are less than people
---
I think you may be overthinking things a bit. Goons are over represented in CSM because a good majority of nullsec play style is dictated by their actions. They are huge and successful because they are organised. Not because they support botting. Or any other bits of nonsense i didn't read in your post

Yep, you're right. I think perhaps you're the exception and not the rule based on some of the other comments on this thread though. Point taken though, the very old mission content also exists in lowsec.

After downtime, also doing a single run of the belts to check for Chelm/officers. Got him twice this way. Can't remember what mods, but pretty sure netted ~9B from them together.

You guys who are too attached to your space stuff, would you rather have an actually more enjoyable game, or stuff?
---
That would be surprising, I've been reporting him for 3 weeks for violating Eve Online's EULA (twitch doesn't allow this) and I got it confirmed that what he was doing WAS violating the EULA. So more than likely, he'll get a ban on both at some point.

It's been damn near a decade since I've played EvE as a space game. 9.5 years of Skill Training Online, 0.5 years of Lonetrek market making.
---
I love EvE. Beautiful music, beautiful visual design, incredible concept, thrilling (...player) stories.
---
The memories closest to my heart are picking out the right missile types for the mission, launching into it with my Drake, and watching pirates explode in the distance. It was meditative.
---
I hope I can get back to doing that again someday.
---
Might be a dumb question........But who is LadyScarlet?        
---
Seriously, I do not know if this a person I really should know who is, or if it is just some random person in EvE.        
---
Could say I'm rather new here tho :-/
---
I do a little something of everything in EvE, but it really IS the relaxation of flying around a beautiful space-scape. Been playing off and on since the BETA of eve, and no matter what else I play or how busy I get in life I always come back and have that same feeling! Welcome!

Lies and baseless accusations. Goonswarm and all Imperium members are a remarkably humble lot notwithstanding all of our glorious accomplishments. Any group who ever looked down at us and told us we would never amount to anything, is now less relevant than we are.

the "botting empire" line always gets me because it's hard for me to believe that anyone actually believes that the weak, pussy-ass shit we get accused of counts as a "botting empire"
---
like, if i genuinely, in a meme-free manner, thought eve was well and truly fucked, i would actually create a botting empire by bulldozing an entire region, writing a bot myself, and provide support in gs_isk while requiring all members to be in a fuck-you-taxation corporation
---
fuckin' "botting empire" man

It's always been like this.  There's not much you can do besides botting exploiting and whatever else there is to even the playing field.

Goddamit from the title I was expecting a really bad one-liner pun. So disappointed...

Plz and thnx CCP
---
Target priority certainly can make a big difference but that's also why it's user controlled.  
---
Also to clarify it isn't really intended to simulate the AT specifically and a lot of ewar is implemented.
---
Many more fights to come don't you worry PL ;) 
---
Yeah it’s a lot harder to move muninns to staging then bombers, bombers can warp cloaked
---
what exactly is mean by "pulling missions" do you complete them with another character? if so how, considering the EULA restriction on dual boxing Alpha?
---
Not a quality shit post/bait thread.
---
Remove caps from FW. All of them, no exceptions.
---
Impliment some more plex mechanics where players will actually need to play while making them much harder for bots.
---
a Rorqual pilot in delve that mines all week doesn't really count as a full player.

Something that handles replays like the old AT viewer would be fundamentally completely different.

You could keep the resource usage sane by having each model represent multiple simulated ships.

Outside of that I can't see 2000+ ship simulations being plausible on phones or low resource systems.

how about a hacking like mini-game on the beacon where the module to activate it is a web, point or scram? ie hacking for pvp fit ships.
---
perhaps not on every beacon, only occasionally. but often enough that any bot would likely need the advanced functionality. apparently exploration bots do exist already but i guess they would be harder to develop that a FW bot.

that is what my discord looks like when i am trying to use text to speech cause i am in a hurry then give up and just type fast with mistakes.

Random small fleets of NPCs sound better. Or maybe even the plexes themselves don't have to stay so basic, make some of them neut or scram until you at least shoot its shield down or something.
---
Minigame or captcha or alike would be better suited on agents or maybe even LP stores.
---
What is this game? Is this like a space exploration game? 
---
*mar5hy alt
---
they already stated this wont be a thing, issue is it would have to check all access lists for every structure and turns into a massive amount of code to make this work.

This removes a whole style of 'gorilla warfare' type gameplay where key systems behind enemy lines are cut off from the enemy.

I remember hunting high sec mission runners, before the war dec started I'd contact list em so I know when they are online, look at their standings so I know where they mostly likely mission from, look up their contract history to see what goodies he might have. Was a lot better than sitting on a gate and killing frigates. sigh..

As a stopgap you can set the ansiblex gate as a waypoint or destination just like any other structure. The route looks wonky and long but it works for semi afk long distance traveling.

Hey, yes Im down for that, where exactly are you? I am just doing some training for a few things atm, do you have any advice on how people build ? Is it glass cannon max dps or do you see more mixed tank and passive heal sort of thing. I liked the look of the Astero for a combat explorer fit. But any advice on a Pvp fit? Is there a Meta for builds? Or is it kind of all over the place in Stat spread?

So I could Twitch stream my rorquals bots and then pay some view bots to watch my rorqual bots mine.

Hulkageddon isn't really a thing any more. Stick to Procurers or Skiffs for maximal tank. Fitting for maximal yield (Hulk with 3 mining/ice upgrades in low, [example](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75460717/)) is euphemistically called "isk tanking".

Yes.  Wingspan is a rather dedicated roleplaying organization, centered around the concept of prompt, and accurate, delivery of high quality munitions, even to players who have not yet specifically placed an order as of yet.  The fact that the delivery inevitably is launched through weapons ports at the recipient only adds to the charm of New Eden.

It's a sandbox MMO in space. 
---
The biggest driving force behind the game is always on PvP with permanent loss which drives the almost entirely player run economy in the game. It is the most unique MMO on the market today because of those things and has some pretty incredible depth.
---
I would not call it an exploration game. Basically every system is in a known location, all PvE missions and combat sites are all known and easily google-able, and you cannot explore planets. There is exploration which is a game mechanic but it is not an exploration game like a No Man's Sky is.
---
what i don't understand is why brag when these are all easy kills. No coordination, thought or skill needed to kill a weak foe but maybe one day you will grow up, detach from moms little titties and fight like a man and take on real targets. I gave up killing them just no point since there was no challenge in it anymore but that's me some people go for easy all they can handle.

Curosity, why active?  So you can output more damage?  I guess the neuting rats need to be priority?

Running joke. It's been going on for 15 years...
---
it's not the worst idea to join them, until you graduate to pvp.
---
Lol at the Eve is dying comment. But seriously, invest in good market skills and mission skills first. Everyone starts there (unless you are a miner for which the profits are garbage and boring). Check your “social” category skills. Also, pick a weapon system and stick with it until you are proficient. Select the best racial ships for your chosen weapon system.

When I get back in game i'mma need to see this channel because I've still been doing this the old way

Broker relations skill, it make broker fee lower by 0.1% per level, and you can get it to lvl 2 on Alpha. However, if you are setting your buy orders in a citadel it doesn't matter since they set their broker fee.
---
They can if they are anti cap fit. I'd agree with buffing their damage output though. I'd like them to be strong when actively defended, and a joke when not.
---
Yeah how do you attack them other than ganking? Anytips? I'll wait. 
---
P good fanfic
---
I'm in the same boat as you are...in about the same time frame.  I love using the Fitting Simulator.  It will save you tons of money in that you can test modules that will show you CPU and capacity limits...what fits where....etc.  You can find fits online and plug them in to see how it impacts your ship.  I wish I started this game a long time ago because who knows where I'll be.  But I agree with you, this game has me hooked.
---
I like the random adaptive nano 
---
We've asked for this.

it's nice to see someone having fun amidst the current state of eve. btw since you're hooked in exploration I suggest you look for a rare 'unidentified wormhole' signature. by default you can see it in the overview if it exists on your current sys :)

Getting it on Steam was not the best move, we already have a launcher that occasionally refuses to work, adding Steam on top of that just makes things worse.

&gt;Being able to win a fight would be a reflection of the skill of the fleet commanders and the people playing the game.
---
have you tried organising 1000s of pilots at once?
---
how is that not a skill? equally, making sure you're doing the same as 999 other nerds is a skill of it's own also.
---
just because these skills aren't identical to "keep at range 45km and spew light missiles from my orthrus" doesn't mean they aren't skills. or hell, maybe keep at range on the anchor and spew 250mm railguns are the same skill, but achieves so much more when you have leaders that can handle fleets bigger than 5 guys without pissing their pants.

if they were all the same quality as this post - i am thoroughly unsurprised that it gets deleted. that's not bias, that's just because you're posting shit.
---
&gt;you would be a fool to believe that anybody has the numbers to contend.
---
this was proven objectively wrong in the last large scale war. when united under the bankroll of casino money, there were a sufficient amount of people to dislodge goons from the north. you're literally talking complete nonsense here.
---
&gt;Not much to brag about now, is it?
---
so 1 group took over an entire game, and caused you to cry like a child on an internet forum about it. that's a hilarious achievement.
---
No worries, you probably won't see any issues, but if you do you can always just do this https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/203523662-Setting-an-account-name-for-Accounts-created-through-STEAM and use the regular launcher.
---
https://crossingzebras.com/hyperion-the-king-of-brawling-battleships/
---
A couple fits. Look at the ship traits first. A hyperion gets no bonuses to drones so no, do not focus on drone damage. 
---
Geckos are far too expensive for something that is 100% going to die, especially something that doesn't even get a bonus to using them. You usually want light drones for peeling off tackle. Those fits include some heavy drones for if you're brawling with something bigger and slower they can actually hit.
---
And lastly no people don't do much solo battleship roaming. Hell not a lot of people do any solo roaming now a days. Battleships are slow, you will get ganged up on, you are slower warping so you can't run away and you're a lovely target for a hot drop. The few times I've done it it's basically kill as much as you can before you die and hope you get a rare 1v1 sometime before that happens.
---
No money? Just watch these 15 ads.

With the questions you're asking those are going to be some extremely expensive kill mails while you're learning.

I love PvP in other games, but PvP in Eve is tedious, sparse, intermittent and time-consuming. I play Eve when I want to chill. I can always carebear for a few hours as time permits and get reliable content that I control. Those of us with lives and deadlines in the real world know what I'm saying.
---
You're fine to start over, that 2-3 hours is just practice.
---
Your flair says otherwise.
---
2029: Man I remember when plex cost was measured in billions. 
---
How much did a fit battleship cost in 2008 though
---
as long as it excludes gates that have a higher cost per unit of LO than is set in your wallet settings.
---
I don't know if there is much you can do to fundamentally change missions.
---
Most games just pour a ton of resources into prettying them up with text quests and unique NPCs.
---
The thing that keeps surprising me is to most fleets I look it is PL who seems to bring the better numbers than NC. I honestly/unironically thought they were dead, but they might be "slightly" more alive than NC.
---
50-70m?

Are u fucking kidding me??

as a new player trying to into the game, could you tell me what makes the game fun and makes you keep coming back to it?

He is consistent

Takes time and gives less than bounties.

Goons are better at sucking though
---
All those extenders and shield mods are up to a point self defeating since they increase your sig by a huge amount, thus causing you to take extra damage. Also, all your shield regen mods / rigs, pass about the 4th one are almost pointless due to the effect stacking penalty and diminishing returns. 
---
254 sounds wrong, very wrong. Did you get this number from in game simulator or from external fitting utility and maybe confused between EHP/s and HP/s ? many players do that, they think they have the HP/s but they don't cause they're looking at EHP/s. Check ingame simulator. 
---
Yes, because of the DPS, you need 900 DPS + to be comfortable. This is super easy to achieve on Gila. The sig size is the 2nd reason, with smaller sig size your speed tanking becomes vastly more effective.
---
everyone's gotta be good at somethin'

I just wanna thank [https://www.twitch.tv/balefuldysnomia](https://www.twitch.tv/balefuldysnomia) for teaching me to play this complex game. I joined her pub fleet one friday without a single kill to my name. Well look at me now. (you can see my first ever EVE kill) [https://zkillboard.com/character/2114190042/](https://zkillboard.com/character/2114190042/)
---
She not only has style (RP) but she's a damn fine leader and teacher. If anyone reading this wants to try out PvP join her Pub fleet, 10pm EST, Channel: CNIOP. She hands out ships even to fresh fresh total new alpha Amarr folks.
---
I mean if I had a 294-69 kill death ratio in any other game I'd feel like I was a total badass. Well it's all her. She gave me the ability to be useful in EVE. &lt;3
---
Uh...if you're bad. Fit ABs, jump gate, bubble on other side. Watch Feroxes die to you in brawl range.
---
When I tried Elite Dangerous it was the travel time that killed the game for me - I could only play it for about a week before returning to EVE. But just be aware that you are now playing a game that doesn't really let you go.
---
How to get the most? Well joining one of the larger starter corps is not a bad way. Corps like Pandemic Horde, Kama Fleet, Brave Newbies or Eve Uni come to mind. They are full of people happy to help you both learn the ropes and to get you started. Alternatively if you want to strike out on your own then there are many sites with the information you need. The official forums and here in r/Eve can be helpful and information sites like Eve Uni's probably cover all the mechanics of the game. But EVE is a game where 'doing' is important. 
---
Hope you enjoy!
---
I should follow ratters with a salvage ship
---
Eh, I used to think the same, but now that I have a job where I often just sit on my ass half the day with nothing else but my phone to keep me entertained. And when I get back home I'm too exhausted from all the aforementioned sitting around to concentrate on serious games, so I just hook up a TV and SNES controller to my phone and chill on a sofa.
---
Oh, yeah, I know the guy. He's a pain in the ass :D
---
O I see, i thought it was per machine, either way though ...
---
You shouldn't have to spend hours farming for buying skills books. They should be almost free on the market (5000 isk?) or better yet, make them already all injected in your character and you unlock them while training theirs requirements.
---
You’ll still lose a bunch of munnins and come out negative because 300m munnins vs cheap af battlecruisers

&gt; Karmafleet ask 1 pap per 3 month
---
it's actually 3 paps per 90 days, which averages to 1 a month. not even a strat pap, any pap will do.
---
like, you get that by accident - you don't even have to try.
---
yea, that would make traveling in null so much nicer, not hovering over the map and adding a shitload of waypoints and ACTUALLY renembering to take the stargate there and not just jump to the next waypoint

---
90% of hisec mining is done by bots, 90% of indy people screw with the market. The reason jita market is full is nullbois exporting their stuff
---
Haha so how does it feel to be apart of the most toxic group in EVE?
---
actually if look @ the Edit 3-4 that i put you can see that he never had viewers before and it just blow up overnight. SO that's seems relaly finshy&gt;
---
It's two guys and their alts tbh
---
The price on basic stuff like t1 battleships and meta mods hasn't fluxed nearly as much as stuff like supers.
---
You only need 1 structure to pull the rocks from the moon. Once it's pulled and exploded into mineable bits, anyone can mine them.
---
No, asset safety is a great mechanic and should apply to ships as well as structures
---
Friendly reminder:  
---
https://imperium.news/renting-period-basis-at-a-steep-discount/
---
Wtb more salt
---
In high security lots of corps ask for a 10 percent cut from you for mining their moon.  Only one structure is allowd per moon.
---
I have run into a few corps that have gank crews if you do not talk to them before you start mining but they are few and far between.
---
Thanks for the reply, but I meant, if another corp (Unrelated to mine) has a station up there already (In the 'Mining Point') can I put my own one up and mine the moon too? Or does that other corp essentially own the moon?
---
Thanks.
---
Thanks, that's the info I was looking for. :)
---
So just show up in a few brick tanked procurers and smacktalk them in local until they fail to gank you. Truly the content in Eve is endless.
---
Yes they own it.
---
New-school technology!
---
Well, Eve is a dystopian universe where corporations wage space war, so it kind of fits. 
---
Lololol 
---
Pretty sure you can do that on Dotlan, you just have to set up all the gates available to you.
---
&gt; a massive amount of code
---
It's more on the computational complexity than the code itself. Whacking the ACL for every Ansiblex in the cluster every time a hauler bot makes a new route is a little scary (think of all the database lookups, yikes!)
---
She needs to compete with INITs 5b babylonrule
---
I think wormhole corps kind of have a stronger feeling of "home" due to the constantly shifting neighbors/lack of real war besisdes evictions (correct me if i'm wrong wormholers.)
---
The other option, which is a way I enjoyed, join a startup lowsec corp or highsec corp.
---
Lowsec/Faction warfare will get you money for small scale pvp and some to play with. This will give you an opporunity to lean PVP and traveling skills in frigate and destroyer fleets wih a couple million on the line instead of 100s of millions. You can find a small corp in your timezone and make friends and feel at home. Wormholes will be a steep learning curve but they seem to be great people to learn from. You will also make more isk but the mid sized fair fights you are looking for may be harder to come by.
---
Huh I've seen sansha ones before I think.

Is this the first fight between Init and Panfam?  I haven't really heard anything out of this campaign yet
---
especially those in the Goonswarm Federation
---
Yeah, I looked at them.
---
Edit 4 makes sense, because he only really started streaming late January with a handful of viewers (sporadic disorganised stuff before that), which ties in with this history on his Discord. And most of those existing viewers were corpmates/friends. 
---
Edit 3, I'll admit I'm not sure how to work it correctly, so might just be missing something. It starts the tracking 16th Feb, which was when the RMT accusation post went up causing a spike in viewers (nosey people, people advertised to via the drama, and an inflated count from at least one troll making multiple Twitch accounts to pop in and harass folk each time he got banned). I don't know if the timeline can be set to show the week before that, because it was 15th Feb I saw the in game advertising by other viewers, so he did have a handful already by the point that tracking starts, it just blew up following the Reddit thread.

Imagine how she counts the rent money if she types like this, this is how you skim like a pro...

1,894,500,000 / 30 = 63,150,000

Are you having trouble making 64m isk per day? because that's a trivially small sum of isk.
---
i compared EVE to a las vegas trip(or a casino), you on in w/ money and no clue on what to do , do a few things, dont even notice the time just blasting past bc all the windows are blacked out and you either leave a rich man or lost it all

Sure thing bruh, bought my first domi hull for 45m
---
*lady scarlet wants to know your location* 
---
Give them hell brav
---
That sounds silly. At the worst you have as many ansiblex gates as there are sov null systems. Most systems already have several gates each so the increase in gate numbers by &lt;1 per system is not significant to performance.
---
Now ACLs all you need to do is for each player to keep a relatively up to date list of accessible ansiblex gates and throw those in the pathfinding algorithm. IN FACT the map already visualises all ansiblex routes you can take at any time so that's already there isn't it?
---
It's a reference to Bliss's rather purple prose in the leadership update a few days ago
---
 small vs big. In small you matter more, pvp is more demanding. Good if you got time to actually become decent at it. Prepare to get stomped though. 
---
Null vs low vs wh. Wh only if you got time cause truth is youll have to make it happen. Also consider your feelings towards dualboxing which i personally hate. Low is a real mess. More if you like 5 ways battle royale space fights. Null is just your standard blob almost everywhere. But check alliances between immensea and geminate in the east youll have the titan issue much less often
---
Ok I don't think I have entered one of those yet, I always find the "unstable WH" and try just hit one or two relic / data sights because I'm worried the WH will shut on me again haha. I will look for these ones! Ty

Whatever it is, it can't possibly be worse paying to live in the NC and Horde space where you get CHARGED for your losses ON TOP of getting no help defending yourself from half of new eden trying to gank you.

Don’t forget they changed how battleship tiers worked way back. They used to use different amounts of minerals. 
---
Full t2 fit domi was less than 100 mill. Hull was around the 50 mark. 
---
(Now Shut Up Before I Raise Your Rent)...
---
At that point id proceed to ask 
---
So How much is your enemies charging for rent?
---
I heard Paragon Soul and Period Basis is pretty nice this time of year.
---
Go further back, 90 day Game Time Codes were 250 mill. Sometime around 06/07?
---
Well, the rate of isk making and now versus then has changed a lot of course, but recently it went from about 1.4bil per 500 plex to 1.9bil per 500 while he rate of isk making hasn’t gone up or changed much if at all.
---
Unless you plan to get seriously into it, you shouldn't really view sp farming as anything but a way to make plexing a completed alt cheaper. That being said if you want to budget around it then you should set up a spreadsheet rather than ballparking the figures.
---
I have several accounts that were never omega, I login with them on SISI all the time, so that's not the issue (being omega on mirror).
---
was your account "Created" recently? and by account I mean account not character(s).
---
No one even remembered what the GTFO was until you had sook about it, and blaming fax fits does not make mass bomber fleets teleporting across the map any less broken.

Aw, init are friends not food
---
Great comment, I never realized this, I was just thinking "yeah I have to make 100millions everyday for 18 days and I'll be good". This comment makes me realize it's really easy to Plex yourself, if you have some basics at least
---
This is something doable with custom maps, when I was in Shadow Cartel they had their own custom made route planner that factored in everything.
---
One of the main features was the ability to add loads of wormholes, which then would be treated like normal jumps. So say you set a route from like Amarr to Tama, it would take into account any titan bridges and wormholes etc. Which considering the amount of wormholes they put into the planner (they were paid per wormhole) was incredibly effective. I remember from their home in Siseide it was possible to get to just about anywhere in lowsec within like 10 jumps on a good day.
---
Im sure other groups would likely have similar programs but i’d imagine theyre kept in-house for obvious reasons, it’s a ridiculously powerful tool, especially considering you could easily be anywhere in eve in a matter of 10-15 minutes.
---
teleporting?  lol.  If it weren't bombers man it'd be something else.  These rorqual pilots aren't going to stop getting tackled just because the fleets are coming from 8 jumps out instead of 3 jumps out.
---

---
Hey I was wondering why did frat kick you guys from Wicked Creek?
---
Ahhh so that's what you were going for with target switching, makes sense.  
---
Are you thinking of an option to have the AI control targeting from the start or an option to have it swap off targets it can't break?  
---
Am I correct in thinking you want more mid-battle data so you can easily get exact numbers rather than trying to eyeball things like distance?  
---
It's a decent idea but smaller screens have very little spare space to fit that type of thing.  
---
I may let people minimize the bottom section and only display the extra data when that's minimized.  
---
Although that does turn it into a fairly big change.  
---
You mean tooltips for the icons right?  
---
Are you looking for an explanation or just what they are (ie "Max velocity with MWD")?  
---
I think the order always matches the ship display selector.  
---
Regardless that's a good point, would adding numbers to the end of duplicates fix this?  
---
For context I already plan to do that for the default fits.  
---
Anyway thanks for all the feedback, it's appreciated.
---
VNIs will self destruct after a neut enters local.
---
Today you can literally print isk at 150m/hr as a baddie with a 1,5b ship.
---
That means playing for 10 hrs you can play for free.
---
Pay for your fucking game and htfu
---
So what do you want to be done? All this rant but I never really understood what motivates you? What is your objectives? 
---
They own it, but once it pops, anyone can mine it with zero penalty.
---
why would we do that when we get *this*
---
ok, so you're getting fully neuted every 15 seconds on average; so you have only 3/4 of your tank worst case for the xl neuts; the heavy neuts might be a bit more of a problem, but not dropping you below 50% of your tank capability. admittedly you can't just sit there eating breakfast and feeling l33t, but have to pay attention to your cap
---
I don't know if that's necessarily true, is it? Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but from a programming perspective, if they handled the ACLs correctly on the database side, I'd imagine there would be a table holding a "Jump Gate ID" tied to an individual Character ID or Corp/Alliance ID? No need to query every structure when you should have a table full of records of who has access to which jump gate and you only need to do a where clause by character to ID to find out which jump gates they have access to.
---
Fuck. You got me, you sneaky bastard.
---
And further incentify others moving there as well?
---
We killed his alt in a rorqual, he got angry warped his sleipnir in. We shot it. Then he warped the Ragnarok straight on top of the rorqual wreck to fear us :-( and secure the loot
---
It's a renter, less "subordinate" more "subhuman".
---
I wouldn't do that, if I were CCP. Those jump gates are OP enough.
---
 Making navigation through that network even easier is unnecessary.
---
Players should be able to think and plan before they want to go to the other end of their large empire in 10 minutes.
---
As a workaround there's an app you can use that will set the shortest route for you ingame via esi.

Why can't I scoop my unanchored raitaru?

Does the character that scoops it have to be in the corp that owned it?
---
You don't even need all t2, full t1 astra does like 15k dps, and neuts out a dread running a single 3200 capital cap booster in about 1 minute 30 seconds. 
---
All you have to do is calculate what gates every player has access to and store them in the database for every single player with access to a gate. There's no way that will add significant resource usage. /s
---
Oh, the fight was going well for us. We held the Titan tackled for 30-40 minutes while Lazerhawks was forming. If SkillU didn’t come to save them we would have cleared the complete grid.
---
Ladyscarlet sounds like the type of person who's idea of content is denying content to others by telling everyone to dock, we need less people like Ladyscarlet  
---
Let people whelp, sometimes you just have to be content to get content
---
 Join a newbro friendly corp (guild) and alliance. The best way to learn is that.

Then go to either low sec. of null sec. space.

That's just *special* now isn't it?

---
It may be me that killed you then :)
---
Imagine how quickly this could happen if we offered to purchase plex to use it 
---
well the whole point is that those books will not get cheaper - as when you consider all the facts - they are not expensive now.       
---
500 mil for a dread skills (capitals + dread book) , 900 mil for a carrier (capitals + carrier) is not much in any terms.             
---
5.5bil for a titan ... well it is a fucking titan, not much then and "even less now". 
---
CCP: Idk about that, but here are some skins and abyssal sites.
---
you have constant flow of new players.       
---
When we are talking about capital ships - check how many carrier books are sold daily. 
---
There's no spoon!
---
That blue and grey is indeed dumb and very color blind unfriendly.
---
What's wrong with good old green, red, grey that always works?
---
That won't do anything to reduce the spam of empty citadels in null though.
---
no.
---
Yes do this, then I can anchor a bunch of them for public use with a 1b cost to use and make isk hand over fist when you don't look at what you're using. Or you suddenly say "no I won't pay that much" and you're stuck in my killbox 
---
Keep in mind if you're doing 60m/hr on "basic" income, you're working an hour a day on plex. You could also work rl for one hour and sub with rl money. 
---
If you get 2h/day to play the game on average, you're losing 50% of your playtime to grinding, when that could be &lt;1% with RL grinding! 
---
the neuts cycle time is 30 seconds, so with 2 neuts that's you being dry once per 15 seconds; and i had been using a generic fit, not a dedicated structure bash fit; going that route, you can drop a lot of bling and use about 1.2b in fitting, use a operational solidifier rig to simplify your shield cycle vs the neut hits; even go dual cap booster; still have a 40k dps tank without including the neut pressure, which doesn't half your tank; so now we have a dread that costs about as much as the t2 fitted astrahus (because you need the full t2 launchers to get even close to breaking that)
---
I am so glad to not live in a space where that kind of histerical bitch tells you how to play.

For the AI: both options would be useful to have if possible. For the mid-battle data: Yes, that'd be cool to have, that will make it easier to determine what is going on.
---
Tooltips for the icons would be nice, an explanation isn't really needed if you ask me, but maybe that's something for later.
---
Adding numbers at the end of duplicates would be great for a better view of which fit is which.
---
Shit Eve have have sound. 
---
Yeah way to treat your renters NC.
---
I mean its not on your precious alliance KB so STFU

Dont you guys have Creditcards ?
---
If you're looking for medium-small scale stuff and stuff that isn't cap blobbing, your best bet is to look at everything that isn't a sov null.
---
So NPC null, low sec (faction warfare and 'pirates' both), wormholes, or groups that operate in Sov null but don't want to hold space (Rote Kapelle, NSH, etc).
---
In Sov null, your options basically become Querious Fight Club, Providence, or *maybe* one of those North-Western alliances like Triumvirate or Old School, granted, I don't know how long that will last before it becomes a Panfam-Imperium Vietnam. 
---
What load of tosh. Usable ansiblex gates are already filtered out on your map. They can just use the map filters for route calculation. It's already client-side
---
Eve is pretty, no doubt about that
---
Yeah, do it. You pretty much just need alpha scanning skills and a t1 explo frigate and you're good to go. The rest is just practise.
---
We told him to stop fucking around, I guess he didn't want to listen.
---
Rest in piss.
---
Horse shit! I could make more for less 11 years ago! There was ways of making isk that has been removed from the game as was abused to shit and CCP didn't like it.

Oï ! You can always try the (dated) EVE Bible concerning new things you want to learn : [EVE University : Tech III Production](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Tech_3_Production).
---
As a wormholer based in a C1, I need you to know that this activity is time consuming, and you will need very specialized skill to properly do Tech III production. You have to get the basic skill for advanced production (that's Advanced Small/Medium ship to level V), plus some shitty science skills to do invention on the Ancient Relics (more on that later), and subsystems technology skills to actually produce the subsystems.
---
You will need multiple things : 
---
* **Ancient Relics**, which are looted from Sleeper Relic sites. They need to be invented, like regular BPC, to yield the Tech III BPC. 
---
* **Subsystems Datacore**, which can be quite tricky to get, and are obtainable with Sleeper data sites.
---
* **Tech III components**, which unlike Tech II components are exclusively built from the Fullerene gases you find in Sleeper gas sites. Some of the most valuable gases can only be found in C5 or C6 wormhole, which mean you either have to set home in the most dangerous wormholes, or do some daytripping. Tech III components also require salvaged materials, from Sleeper wrecks (and again, some can only be found in certains sleepers wrecks, like battleship or drifters ones).
---
Concerning the spreadsheet and all that, you can do it yourself.
---
I think you need to be :
---
1. In the right corporation.
---
2. Have the good roles in said corporation, which allow you to pick up or lay down citadels.
---
Be sure the unanchoring sequence is indeed finished, too.
---
Wait, aren’t you supposed to say something shitty about (insert name of alliance)???
---
Ask nicely and stop doing the thing that got you banned in the first place (or simply being a dick). That's not something you should ask here : it's a Discord problem, not an EVE one.
---
Oï !
---
Just a question please : what do you mean by the best compressed ores to use ? If you're talking about the minerals, I use the [cerlestes.de](https://ore.cerlestes.de/ore) website. It gives you the value of the refined product, and also which ore are the best per m3 to get a certain type of mineral.
---
implying she knows how to correct the spelling
---
You forgot to include the difference in income to make this post worth anything.
---
As for getting the most out of your experience, my first recommendation would be to get a little taste of everything.  Go through the tutorial missions and give them all a shot, find what you enjoy doing to make isk, and explore that a little more.  I highly recommend looking into exploration in low sec (0.4 and below), nullsec (0.0 and below), or wormhole space running data/relic sites.  You can fit a super cheap, quick ship to run these and make super good isk for a new player.  
---
Once you've got your feet wet and have an idea of some of the mechanics in the game you should definitely find a group to join, and the group you join should reflect your desired play style.  You can always ask again when you've find out what you enjoy and what you want to strive towards, and the best thing is if you change your mind you can always move to something else. Eve is a sandbox, just make sure you're having fun and enjoy the company of the people you fly with.  
---
Large nullsec alliances will have a little bit of everything and are a great way to get rich, they are generally very user friendly and can help provide ships/training/skillbooks to get you going but can make you feel less significant since there are so many people.  Eve University is a great place to start too, it's a group that specialize in teaching new players the mechanics of the game and you can move from there to do whatever you enjoy.
---
Whatever you do don't stay in highsec and don't join a highsec corp, especially if they claim to do everything "pvp, WHs, null, pve, industry, etc".  These corps are always noob traps and will almost certainly burn you out.  If you want extreme safety just join a large nullsec alliance, they are generally safer than highsec if you're smart about how you fly.
---
Log(n) lookup for accessible structures, add results to stargate graph, perform usual shortest path algorithm on it at no real extra cost. Easy.
---
Skill books are already the single largest isk sink in the game.
---
2030: /giveisk 999999999999
---
&gt; 2029
---
That's optimistic lol
---
Bait cynos are novel but wear off in about two seconds. 
---
Blacklisting would only affect structure-based generators. Fleet cynos would always be visible when available.
---
I was honestly surprised when I learned this wasn't a feature released alongside the new Jump Gates. +1.
---
I really appreciate this comment, gives me an idea on what to aim for thanks, I’ll look into something in the east
---
rorqual: ya'll mind if I swap out to shield bursts.
---
 *Now I'll just sit here, waiting for the "HS Merc" salt to start flowing...* 
---
There is no salt except from the small war deckers who have an increased cost and a vulnerability along with the inability to war dec everyone and are low effort, I note one particular loud mouth one that has already left the game and has now given up posting too.
---
PIRAT and others like them will be fine, though the initial period when nullsec alliances come in will be fun and there are some exploits possible around the new system, because if I war dec my other corp I can actually rep them too.    So I can get around it.
---
Nothing an out of game tool isn't currently solving anyway, it's not like those of us in the big blocks are looking down our maps working this out manually.
---
CCP adding this would just be a nice QoL change, whilst also enabling public gates to be more readily accessible to all.
---
Nah, BOT clearly won the field. :^)
---
i noticed that if i play eve and also read this subreddit i'll kind of get discouraged to play eve, there are so many complaints that i actually dont even notice during the actual gameplay, everyone says it's shit and that's dying, yet they complain if cpp change the neutral thing on pvp (which it had to be like this since the start of eve for me). so dunno i dont care, the more ignorant you are the better you enjoy eve, so i'll stay ignorant
---
And imo, you are not supposed to be spoonfed.
---
You ought to plan, you ought to open the map and use your brains.
---
And most people have probably used the packs already
---
I've heard Imperium renting space was both cheaper and safer.
---
Its just a t spin
---
Sorry to say but they have not, you need to think a bit, some other people have worked out that if you are at war with another corp then you can rep them.   So all you have to do is have a war with your alt corp and a mutual war has been made easier so you do that and you can rep to your hearts desire.
---
I'm up for almost any change in FW. This swamp needs to be reworked. 
---
For the vast majority of items, you'll be fine as an alpha. Just don't trade with stuff like injectors, extractors or PLEX.
---
Something has changed since I've last played. 500 plex is 15000 days of game time in my mind. 
---
So, I'm assuming that now it takes 500 plex for 30 game days? Why in the hell would CCP make that change?
---
Right because it's impossible to do both
---
Unless the VM purposely makes the info available (eg special drivers, CPU ID etc) there's no "check" you can do. Good VMs behave just like bare metal.
---
Don't bother to vote, but had plenty of energy to complain about being unrepresented
---
:Thinking:
---
We are all just happy to see PL can put 50 guys in a fleet, there is hope for you yet.
---
Oh this must have happened while I was gone
---
The plex are cheaper but the game time is more expensive. For a while it hovered between 3.3 &amp; 3.5m per plex but recently has jumped up to 3.8 - 3.9m. It's just more revenue generating for CCP.
---
I feel you. I started reading this sub to start understanding the language of the game.... since then it’s pretty much just people shitting on each other.   
---
You'd best be taking good care of my Valador... gutted I wasn't online to pew at him.
---
Transaction successful, your Mtn Dew™ Credit Card has been charged 30000 McDollars.
---
Player-owned stargates, basically the new jumpbridges.
---
Sure. But why not cut out the middleman and just introduce a teleportation button in the contextmenu? Just open the starmap, right-click a system, select "Teleport" and woosh, you're there, including all the assets you packed.
---
Fucking hell, just kill this game already.
---
Most CovOps except bombers has a 5 second delay after uncloaking until they can start locking anything, giving you plenty of time to warp off.
---
Welcome friend. o7
---
Right, but they might attempt to gank a barge, but probably not an orca, and if they do they might know what they need to kill it.
---
I was honestly scared he was going to scroll in and I would wake up in a prisoner wagon.
---
Thanks for the laugh.
---
She's also very fat. Or is that a bannable offense on this sub/r/? idk, dont care. But yea, she's been around for a while.
---
Attention seek much? 
---
Meanwhile it works with GARPA with no problem.
---
If the checking of all access lists is a problem, just let players do their own "jump bridge list" as you do for GARPA or Dotlan. 
---
I am setting up a couple of carriers in key locations to be able to move ships to these hisec islands because I can think of no better way to upset war deckers than keep making them have to defend their war HQ's in far off places and dragging them away from their main content.   So let them do it I will have fun!
---
please drink verification can to confirm 
---
I wish they thought of this before adding player run markets, rip jita performance. 
---
I had to google to find out what viewbotting actually is.
---
I just watched on [https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/EVE%20Online](https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/EVE%20Online) to see what eve online streamers there were and the top streamer had 31 viewers.
---
Why would you ever viewbot for eve online? It doesn't make sense. There will never be a return on investment big enough to warrant that for a game like eve.
---
That would not even be a question if things were just as simple as "I worked one hour more today and got paid {my hour rate} more". In fact it usually does not work that way, and also you have some poor countries where that would be a day or more of RL work, so you would basically earn more money by C5/C6+RMT instead of working for the average salary in your region.
---
#2 would be awesome and I believe that has been suggested by a bunch of people a couple of times. There were a ton of good ideas in the fw rework focus group that got scrapped :(
---
Yea that was pure gold, here it is for those who haven't seen it http://i.imgur.com/dgGvgKF.png
---
you will need a structure in high-sec yourself, also the cost say's too not fit the structure and not defend it. 
---
That’s a cool function 
---
Capital ships are not really useful in the general FW meta and I am ok with them being used for the final ihub bash. It makes sense and is a cool final fight type of thing for a system (even though the system promotes leaving every single system vulnerable and not capping atm)
---
I've not played in years but it is good to see nothing at all has changed. 
---
Lol. No more bait beacons.
---
No.
---
Access Lists are on the Corp level. You can belong to multiple access lists. Not every access list will have access to every jump gate.
---
To find out which access lists you are on you have to query for EVERY access list (For every Corp), get the characters on those lists, then see which ones you're on.
---
Once you have the list of lists you then query for every gate on each list and then add the result set to your starbase map. 
---
Access List querying can also get funky as some operate as a Whitelist but some operate as a Blacklist.
---
Even if you have a list of accessible structures beforehand if you're in a Blue Doughnut of Sov your O(Log(n)) lookup will contain thousands of structures and still take a long time. That's assuming it's indexed (and the index is up to date) or you're looking at O(N). 
---
I imagine panfam would bring something more appropriate to fight AB Munnins.
---
&gt; I’d like your recommendation on how I can get the most out of my EVE experience.
---
This is going to sound really obvious, but two things:
---
1.  It's M**M**O, it's a lot more fun when you interact with other players.  Don't be suckered into mining for long periods, which leads me into....
---
2.  Try a lot of different things, if whatever you are doing starts to get a bit dull, try something else
---
You should be able to hide beacons based on standings towards the owner imo
---
G
---
Oh shit watch out guys we got a badass here! ;D
---
Campaign starts....next week or something
---
They changed your flair!
---
Our raitaru, looks like this scene from Alien isolation. Pretty cool. https://youtu.be/OQ9As4M7wq8?t=34
---
It's orbiting gas giant inside wormhole.
---
Maybe not but it's still against the EULA.
---
Yeah bro , that’s a good tale . Great job on the comeback . U have an upvote 
---
I wish my computer was powerful enough to run EVE absolutely maxxed out. :(
---
EVE is beautiful &lt;3
---
I thought it would be the Skyrim meme after he explodes 
---
This was way scarier 
---
Not if I join one of the defending corps /alliances with the characters that I want to use to hit them, though their structure is at risk of course.      But in any case that hardly matters, because anyone who does this as a matter of course will not be able to take my hisec structure anyway, because any war decker worth their salt will use their structures as bait in their main area.
---
I see them roaming together around black rise a lot, they’re good dudes! 
---
10K ISK... Hm... That isnt even the entry fee for one of the cheaper clubs in Jita.
---
It's a QOL request. It's not real... yet. Hopefully.
---
So you request something that you don't want to be added?
---
Stop playing 3D chess with CCP. 
---
This. The valentines sale was meant to correct this, but everyone was pissed that week so no one bought any (and it was only a 10% sale)
---
&gt; You could also work rl for one hour and sub with rl money.
---
That's not really how a lot of jobs work. I work 37½ hours a week for X money, if I work 38½ I still get X money.
---
You just started, you can just make a new account, if you didn't pay for game time yet. If you have any assets already you can transfer them to your new character in game.
---
Also ACLs can change mid route.  
---
Blasters will deal most of your damage. Drones are useful to you for three reasons:
---
1.) Always nice to have a bit of extra DPS. And yes, Geckos are a great choice, but they'll cost more than the rest of your ship, so I recommend settling for a set of regular heavies. 
---
2.) Applying to light tackle - your blasters will simply not track an interceptor unless you really grapple-scram him down to under 50m/s, but a set of Warriors will eventually chew through him. 
---
3.) Emergency ECM - carrying a pack of EC-300s is fairly common, use them to either get out of a scram, or even reduce the incoming damage. Kinda like the burst jammer you wanted, but this way you keep all your mid slots. 
---
&gt;do people usually do that much solo battleship roams/baits?
---
I'd say it's less than common - people tend to roam in frigates and cruisers cause battleships take so long to get anywhere. But in my experience a solo battleship always ends up in some kind of fun fight in the end, unless it gets dropped by caps. 
---
Search ["lussy lou: hero..."](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=lussy+lou+hero) on youtube to see footage of possibly *the* #1 solo battleship pilot in the game. 
---
They split plex into 500 units and got rid of aurum. Needs 500 for a month of game time.
---
&gt;Not if I join one of the defending corps /alliances with the characters
---
8 day bash 7 day wardec math say's no, honestly just burning structures to get all the null blocs and when they show up structure dies. 
---
r/CapsuleersAnonymous
---
Problem is we don't export meta mods from null. If its shit loot its just reprocessed for mins... That is if anyone bothers to stick an MTU up when carrier/super ratting 
---
To get around those beacons have your cyno on your watch-list, and right click that and select jump to.
---
Can someone please post Bliss' leadership update? Love to follow you guys
---
Rrd
---
It's much more tanky though. https://i.imgur.com/0yCYwFB.png Also, the fuck is Tribal issue and where does it come from? 
---
**Most of all, keep your discipline, minimise risks and do not throw your ships away cheaply.** 
---
Ah. So, I'm guessing PLEX is spent in the store now to buy monocles and shit?
---
In an actual fleet setting, the tempest FI is pretty decent. It has more fitting than t1, which makes putting artillery on it plus an armor tank much easier than t1 pest. Plus, with an extra low and more base HP, gets a decent overall tank.
---
The issue is machs are like 25m more expensive and work a lot better now. Also, in typical CCP fashion, after buffing the t1 pest, they never iterated on the fleet version. Because everyone who isnt using them in a fleet brought up the same issues you have.
---
Preferably, id like to see CCP rebalance all navy battleships. If the Pest FI fell in line with the firetail, stabber FI and Hurricane FI and got a 10% damage bonus per level and 10% tracking bonus per level, it would find a solid niche as a high alpha, good tracking battleship in both small gang and fleets.
---
The only other projectile tracking bonused battleship is the vargur. Itd be nice not to have to spend 2b just to have a kitey BS with a tracking bonus.
---
It’s a special edition kinda like the State issue raven, not sure what event it came from though. 
---
Navy bs are complete shit in general except for buffer tanking.
---
If tfi got some more speed and a tracking bonus I'd cream myself. 
---
Minnie equivalent of Raven State. Old prize ship. 
---
That's precisely why the WH life is so wonderful. Maybe you live in Lowsec, where pvp is always a thing to do and almost in every system there are players to fight with, just fit a frigate pvp ship and roam 5 minutes. But the WH sensation and handshaking when you are cloacked, hunting, baiting and not knowing precisely who is there and what is going to engage you, can't be compared to any other activity in this game. Nice kill 😉
---
AT maybe?
---
we could probably up those numbers if we pull all our alts out from hard knocks
---
Possibly but I don’t think so, it was a long long time ago...I think some sort of lore event. I could be totally wrong ) 
---
^^^ This
---
Yeah, sac for darks, use a gila for the exotic gamma electric. If you put some isk into faction webs it helps a lot as you can then web them from 14k instead of 10k. Which reaaaallly helps the clear time
---
yeah, they got rid of Aurum (the old currency used for the store)
---
Thank you =)
---
I switch to another corp that is still war decked, easy to do.
---

---
Welcome, someone will be out shortly with the new player copypasta but briefly:
---
- Do the tutorial and the career agent missions, if you didn't already. This will give you a small taste of various aspects of the game and hopefully tell you what you like to do in game.
---
- Do the SOE epic arc 
---
- Join a corp. I recommend Eve Uni to learn about the game and corp play before deciding where you want to be longer term.
---
It’s a AT prize from one of the First ATs , like raven state issue , federation navy issue and apocalypse imperial issue , where only 5 ships exist irrc 
---
Tell that bitch to go and fuck herself lol

i mean casters and admins did last time so there is hope )

Febuarry 2 is where it jumped like crazy
---
I have no idea... People do that bcs they think they will get partner.
---
Yeah you should run it instead, you beacon of mental stability and paragon of collectedness. God beware you ever get irritated
---
One thing on my "things to do in Eve" list is to drop in on a mission runner in a Confessor by combat scanning his MTU, suspect bait him by nuking the MTU and then proceed to kill him
---
now i remember why i left.
---
haven't been back in game for a full 24 hours and i've already been wardecced for mining ice. 
---
Bravely said by someone who has never killed anything big without his 500 man blob in the back.
---
God you're so deluded you probably don't even know why that comment is so retarded
---
Probably something to do with the build-cost dropping through the floor13b will get you one these days.             
---
          
---
Also private contract to sell, never use trade. 
---
Ah OK, thanks. 
---
Yeah don't read this sub to learn stuff. There's nothing you can learn here actually, I only come here to check if there's something cool to see
---
Why don't you contact Eve Scouts, the people that save others trapped in WH space, give them the system name and they will find you access, get a alt in there, create a dummy corp with an alpha account, transfer to that corp and then you are good.
---
Hello sir, this picture was photoshopped, don't let yourself down :)
---
Just leave it on contract.
---
If you have structures in space they can wardec you
---
If you don't have those then your Corp can't be wardecced.
---
So my advice is to take down the structure you anchored and your problem should be solved in the next 24 hours as the war will be invalidated.
---
A good, sensible idea. Have an upvote!
---
Yea and it got old 12 years and 11 months ago. 
---
just after i posted i checked. there was an old control tower from 8 years ago. i assumed it would have been destroyed long ago during one of the wardecs while i was offline
---
True, but unless you're in really bad financial shape then you should consider dropping the 20bux anyway and taking it out of your cigarette/ice cream budget. 20 dollars to spend 15 hours flying and having fun with your mates (instead of afk grinding) is money well spent. 
---
Someone's an angry elf. Let's give Scarlet a hug.
---
&gt; is skillu defending Panfam renters 
---
No but V0LTA was there and is *always* worth killing
---
You misspelled krabbing.
---
&gt; You shouldn't have to spend hours farming for buying skills books.
---
I know, right? The skills should be free, every anom should give 100M in loot. and ship losses should just respawn in your hangar. This game is outdated and just too goddamned hard.
---
I seriously doubt that.    PIRAT will just do war decs against major alliances with a cheap Upwell structure.   It is not exactly difficult, however the two week immunity will frustrate them which is good, but in any case I noticed that they would war dec my previous nullsec alliance every two to four weeks so it really does not matter to them.
---
Dayum
---
Wish theyd have more pve/missions/anomalies in near orbit of celestial objects like the ice dwarfs event. Was IMO the best looking scenery ever (apart from the blindning whiteness)
---
I feel your suffering, still sitting on my hel.
---
Back in the days i paid 24 billion isk for the hull, now i get 14 billion for full fit. 
---
I for one am not supporting CCP Hilmars costa rican mansion fund.
---
I'll buy it for  three fiddy . 
---
Jeez that’s even worse. Might as well sd it
---
I’ll buy it for 14b. Pm me
---
Git gud
---
How many Fountain minutes is that
---
Is this something dotlan can do with API? It could set a wonkier path, similar to what /u/cactusjack48 suggested, but since it's a 3rd party app it's not something we have to wait for from CCP.
---
Welcome, now eve will be somewhere in the back of your mind for the rest of your life :)
---
Download Evemon so you can plot out training plans for your character and as was said here use zkillboard to look for fits pilots are actually flying in the losses you can see the fit. Then you can use pyfa to mock up your own fits, or the in game simulation tool which isn’t terrible.  
---
Is it fitted or did you try to sell just a hel hull for 15b?
---
Beautiful find! I too am an explorer and would love seeing the sights like that.
---
GRRRRRRR?
---
Like the sound of these ideas..  
---
Everyone can have a bad day :P
---
And his channel went back online last night. He shared the email he got from Twitch ;)
---
Proof of mods favouritism here
---
Alright.
---
Eh, yes they are, when you go towards your first carrier, 500m is a lot
---
You should let the botters know, I'm sure they'll stop right away. /s
---
Multiple monitors friendo. 1 monitor for Netflix/Reddit/etc. 1 monitor for pvp. 1 monitor for eve-o preview with rorqs/AFP vnis or domis. Minerals you mine while watching The Expanse are free. 
---
&gt; the unique constellation layout means low travel time.
---
Barkrik is like one the the biggest systems (I guess there are four cosmos 100 AU systems ?)
---
Hurricane fleet issue is the same.
---
Hurricane has more dps
---
Fleet has EHP.
---
navy ships in general, outside the Vexor Navy (whose dps and bonuses make it a rival to Myrm, Ishtar(when not sentry), and domi for drone dmg.)   are just bad right now.  overpriced, mostly just for tank use.
---
we've been complaining about how they have no point with pirate ships being near the same price and yet full out upgrades in all ways to normal t1 ships.
---
while faction ships, despite the increased price, are a nerf to aspects for a ehd buff (which all pirate ships have by default)
---
nope. Go lanngisi.
---
The best piece of advice I can give you for getting the most out of the game is don't buy PLEX, no matter how tempting it seems.
---
EVE is a game where having money helps you win, but only if you have the experience to back it up. A lot of experienced players fund their own game time by killing and looting inexperienced players who have funded expensive ships and modules using real money.
---
Sometimes, when you're still learning - and you'll be "still learning" for pretty much your entire EVE career - having more ISK can hinder your ability to learn. The best thing you can do for your own experience and fun is play cheap and wise. Fly ships you can afford to replace 10, 20, 30 times over, lose them without regret. You WILL lose ships, especially if you seek out PVP but also if you're trying to avoid it. This is out of your control but what isn't out of your control is the aftermath of that loss and how much you still want to keep flying and learning after it happens.
---
or angel.
---
Abyssal sites are great mate. 
---
They only announced the possibility, once DX12 has been implemented. They won't be making use of it right away.
---
Besides, EVE has been using raytracing for years now. For example the clouds in dungeons and the tiny asteroids in asteroid fields (called metaballs) use regular raytracing.
---
This new tech will **not** improve server performance, since the server is limited by networking and message processing. It also won't make EVE magically become prettier. It will only make existing raytracing usage more efficient, and possibly encourage to make more use of it in the future.

Fitted with rigs, fighters, cap rechargers, fuel

Are they in lowsec?

:(

I’ve seen a lot of success with the Armageddon and Bhalgorn due to their neuting power. I highly suggest trying this stuff out in smaller ships first. Generally you want to be able to disengage by being faster than the main fleet, able to quickly kill/neut out tackle. However, you can just fit for insane tank and try those tactics.
---
If you want to kite (I suggest practicing this in more forgiving ships and it teaches spatial awareness) some good options include the caracal, the hurricane, the cynabal, jackdaw/confessor, condor, garmur (this is way easier than most frigates thanks to bonuses), orthrus. If you want to practice kiting with large weapons I have seen some people have insane success using blaster kite talos fits to alpha frigates, so that can work. 
---
Either way, I suggest something smaller because not only is it cheaper and easier to react quickly in but because it attracts less attention and this gives you better odds of a good fight.
---
You do realise that earning 20$ per hour is a luxury you only have in a few rich countries? In most countries you earn way less. Like &lt; 5$ per hour. 
---
gravelers (pl's old tfi doctrine) with triage and good setup was really fucking hard to bomb/break because of tank. alpha with arty let you get away with murder when they were fighting bni hordes. now booshers are a thing and most sationary doctrines get rekt by them. why no one fields these currently and looks at them with disdain. so if anything ruined tfi uses it was booshers and machariels to an extent. feelsbadman.
---
Hmm, again I'll be honest I'm not great at reading those kind of sites, so I could be missing the obvious. But it looks like a steady rise, with little spikes (coinciding with when he did giveaway streams, the free promotion, etc ) that have contributed to a steep but steady upward trend. And viewer/follower count have followed about the same track. 
---
However, since that period you're saying was an unreasonable spike was before I heard of the guy, and it could well be my lack of expertise interpreting those graphs, I'll not argue. Can't see anything out of order with his current trends, and his view/follower increases do match with his activity/giveaway increases, so there is still an innocent explanation that should be considered, too.
---
This stuff looks awesome. I'm interested in  being able to make use of it to calculate trades between say Jita and a nullsec citadel market, I tried one now and it didn't seem to work.  
---
Another note in the trade tool, it'd be interesting to know what the volume sold in the destination system typically is, (If it's very low, that's problematic) 
---
So you're an alpha then? 
---
Because consuming 500 plex turns that unrealized profit into a realized profit. 
---
To be honest, I cannot tell with 100% certainty the guy is viewbotting. Just Think that he is. Doesn't make me right tho on that.
---
the thing is nobody on eve online has this kind of viewers beside Imperium News sometimes or like burn jita but that happen once a year and even then i didn't see them go to 350. Again might be those afk but that's seems like a lot of people Also could be a few people with Alternate account to try to get as much  "stuff from is store"
---
Again we probably will never know the truth of that
---
PS: I haven't herd of the AFK BRB thing being a breach of the TOS of twitch i probably should take a look @ that but if he just shows videos or like sitting in the station with is stream open he should be fine. Because interaction is not needed as there some stream of 24/7 Music or some streamers that are mute ect. Again will probably have to take a look at that
---
PPS: Hopes he can figure is things out and if he is viewbotting that's kinda shitty if not then hope is stream will go well :D
---
Not everyone has a bad day every day
---
Looks like Lady won the field
---
Looks like that super is giving you one hel of a time. Can't you get it to somewhere civilized like Maila?
---
Yep, but it'll be like everything else, CCP will leave it half assed while they work on the next half assed feature, and a bunch of people will defend them for no reason.
---
Most elite.
---
Right, like you would know. Stay ignorant
---
It's always nice to feel included. Best of luck on your "to get revenge I will become anonymous linemember 2948738" scheme
---
Any other smaller factions you recommend? I just joined horde and I like the structure and all the help there is. But it doesn't feel like working at Walmart. Lots of names and no one really knows your name. The mining experience was good...it was like going on a field trip as a kid.
---
I just don't want to interrupt anyone or constantly bug them with questions.
---
I still watch the eve videos on YouTube but it doesn't seem like a lot of tutorial and noob starter tip content is really made...game being as old as it is I expect that.
---
Recommend any?
---
Brave Newbies, Pandemic Horde, Karmafleet, Eve Uni, Dreddit are all good options.
---
I am sure I am missing some major ones. Just join the recruitment channels in-game, in Discord or on the evejobs subreddit. There are plenty of options
---
Well im not a recruiter, but my corp is pretty newbro friendly. Our alliance has newbro fits thats welcome on EVERY fleet.
---
Join a biggish alliance, but not one that is mainly newbro focussed like horde. Also horde is not well liked by the rest of the game. 
---
since when not having to go through unnecessary steps to use a feature in the game is "being spoonfed" you absolute fuckwit?
---
Much dps.
---
Everyone will say otherwise but if you don't play anymore, here is what i'll do :
---
Undock, Die like a man.
---
I mean, they only have a little longer of doing that. Soon neutral logi will be removed - if neutral logi reps people during a wardec, they get concorded. 
---
Using your brains is hard, but it (still) has to happen in order to play Eve.
---
jeah, now only nc must start using something else than supers and jackdaws and we all can have fun
---
Adult is a relative term in the US i see, interesting
---
Would you also like CCP to hold your dick for you while you pee? :thinking
---
Can confirm. The fort time I saw that mail in eve I was like holy shot what happened?
---
Bu that's effort, man. Eve needs more automation.
---
this is hilarious!
---
This \^. Next thing noobs want would be to have autopilot jumping he gates for them and paying the fee when a prompt to pay pops up.
---
That was rhetoric question, too complex for you, shithead.
---
Lady is doing poor job being a leader. threatening if her renters krab too much and welp ships, there will be fines of 1B :D  
---
It is your customers. This does not happen like that.
---
Well with all stuff below why not due to various public access lists ... maybe we could get this only for alliance owned gates.    
---
Might be because when you clone jump to it you get put somewhere in the system and you have to warp to the ship.   
---
But I guess this proposal is about jumping with it as you would be sitting in a station or something :)
---
I agree with this post, I currently am in one of the top big alliance and it’s not what I expected. I just feel like another fish in the pond of newbies, It’s also really difficult to get somebody to be your mentor since there are so many newbs like myself and it’s not that easy to get noticed..
---
At that point I did strip all my SAAR frigs, around 100 or so and just sold them, choosing to fly some other fits until the dust settles
---
A single 6/10 good drop for any faction site gives you half or even all isk needed - and you can do it easily in a gila or VNI. 
---
Very unfortunate to have people with more than two brain cells telling idiots that they are dumb for throwing ratting supers and unsupported titans into a trig bc blob with dread support. Imo everyone with more than three brain cells should be banned for the game so we could have more fun.
---
Meh
---
Thank you so much for taking the time to explain the finer points.  The 254 is the in game simulator (also says 254 HP/S), I exported in Pyfa (should have done this before).  It says 545 ehp, and 255 HP/s Passive Shield recharge.   One thing you did mention is that the SIG radius, comparing this to another expensive build is huge!  276 Sig vs a different one at 145 ( I will post the one I am comparing).
---
I have it ingrained that passive is easier (and better) because of risk of loosing capacitor.  Am I wrong in this thinking?  Do you have a relatively inexpensive fit to list that I can start off with?  Should I just stay with active because of the increase damage in lows for drone?

Take your prescribed medicine and do not post on Reddit before you do that.

it's literally just one guy in a hound dude

Hfi has a pretty substantial tracking bonus, application bonus is a theme with navy cruiser and bc, just not bs.

If only that were true. We’ve been waiting for that day from many many years.

You can kill it though and take their moon

Oooh burn. very complex joke, needed at least 2 brains to think of that.

Look mate, i get it, lowsec needs some love, but Abyssals are content for the whole fucking game.

Also, yeh fucking art designers should totally be doing game balance.

Skins dont exactly take a lot of fucking time. I fucking hate this argument its so fucking stupid.

TLDR. Stop bitching about pointless stuff, if you said ffs CCP give us us more shit in lowsec i'd be right there with you.

That's not true. If a dev told you that, they are going by outdated information.

The client already knows which gates you can access. That's why you can see them on the map.

&gt;fter the April release, the penalty for direct targeted neutral assistance meeting the conditions above AND occurring within highsec will become a criminal flag and CONCORD response. The safety system will prevent the activation of the targeted assistance modules under these conditions, so we suggest that support pilots in highsec engage their safety at either green or yellow levels to prevent unintentional CONCORDOKKEN.
---
&gt;For area of effect command bursts we are approaching the problem a little differently as you may want to continue boosting the members of your fleet that are not involved in a war. Therefore, after the April release neutral command bursts will simply not affect a pilot that meets the conditions listed above when activated in highsec space.
---
Neutral logi is concorded, links won't apply. After the april release, but y'know it's something. 
---
It used to be funny.  Now its looking more and more like someone has a time machine and isnt talking.

Lmao did you really believe EVE players would simply follow a paper pusher like that that obviously has very minimal in-game mechanics experience? Not even renters fell for your self-important "coup" that you thought you could pull off without knowing jack shit other than how to warp to the nearest Drone Horde. You don't even manage to sell a super by yourself without losing ISK, like what the fuck
---
I'll buy that hel off your hands for 14b 
---
Osprey Navy, Omen Navy, Brutix Navy, Harbinger Navy, Hurricane Navy are also decent ships atm.
---
When i ran a Wh corp our fight motto was either 
---
"Its a trap....Lets spring it"
---
and 
---
"So you are telling me theres a chance?"
---
If theres a 30% chance of winning a fight, thats 29% higher than it needs to be to take the fight
---
navy cruisers arent that good vs pirate cruisers.  and the price is usually around the same.
---
and navy  BCs avoid that mearly by there not being pirate BC.....yet. 
---
and still, for their price. its questionable if the change is worth it.
---
Reprocess it.
---
Join whoever you want and never listen to people like this. Horde and brave are both great places if you have any initiative. 
---
Yeah get zero isk instead of 14b, much better. 
---
The price of renting from the "elite" i guess.. ;D
---
He did make me join...with his wheelchair...
---
Thanks :). If i’m correct you would like to see a option to search between stations/locations instead of systems?
---
Between the EVE stations this is not a big deal but player citadels can be private. Wat was the nulsec system you tried to seach in and what citadel did you want to find/use?
---
Currently we are trying to create those statistics so we can display historical data of the items sold on the stations. When that system is working properly we will integrate it in the trade tool. 
---
Yeah...Just kidding bro...
---
Don't know if you took it seriously or not...but if you didn't...great
---
Nobody tell him

Welcome back. o7
---
SirMolle is/always will be the best PR for BoB. 
---
Speaking of tribal issur, whar's with the chinese or whatever megathron?
---
because that sounds like way to much work for well something that is gonna be not relevant in like a couple of months.
---
Like realistically to my day to day eve playing this isn't relevant at all it's more of a bit of interesting trivia of edge cases where this right now is a problem, plus all of this isn't gonna matter when ccp changes war again soonish. 
---
Sell it for 11 or 12. 
---
I'll be at home, watching Japanese cartoons and having a crying wank until i fall asleep.
---
I mean you could contract it to me (snuff btw) in exchange for a solemn wove to never use it for anything but mean stuff to people who don't really deserve it   surely that would be the best outcome of this series of unfortunate events?
---
Has CCP really introduced a mechanic that prevents all but the owner from scooping unanchored Upwell structures?
---
Just to clarify, The website associated with this video is [http://eve-cs.com/](http://eve-cs.com/) . Sorry i'm bad at doing a reddit.
---
It's too complicated should never be an excuse to not do something. It's a challenge to find a simpler solution.
---
One though, it'd be easier to add a tab in People, Places folder called, "Useable Ansiblex Jump Gates" and players can drag and drop jump gates into this folder. When the box is checked, the route will merely check that player's bookmarks. Now here is where things get really cool-- corporations, just like Corp bookmarks, can have their ansiblexes added to Corp members folders. That way when FC calls a destination, it doesnt rely on every knucklehead to have already added every ansiblex on their own.
---
imagine sitting and watching someone else play this game for literally any amount of time.
---
fuck.
---
You can also participate, It's not held IRL, it's online :)
---
&gt;Omen Navy is good
---
Yeah you're clueless.
---
&gt;Lmao did you really believe EVE players would simply follow a paper pusher like that that obviously has very minimal in-game mechanics experience?
---
how long have you been playing this game?
---
I have no idea, sorry.
---
so basically capsulers can now pull a plug on their immortality :P

---
**ELON MUSK: Would like to know your location.**
---
Yes ways that were exploited by the few. Anyone can get a rorq or super rat. Also the proliferation of bottlers.
---
All of it creates more isk in the game, which devalues currency, which means things seem more expensive. 
---
Most navy cruisers are fitting into the progression properly and find uses.
---
Nosprey's are basically cheap Orthrus and are good at anti-tackle. Same with the Nomen, though less so now since ramjags are a thing.
---
ScyFI's are versatile in brawling or kiting with RLML or a/c's. They're not the strongest navy ship, but they do have a few roles to utilize. 
---
They could all use some tweaking, but the Navy Caracal, Stabber FI and Exeq NI could use more drastic improvements/updates.
---
Navy battleships do bring some things to the table that aren't done by pirate battleships, but they're subtle. Like the Navy Raven's application bonus gives it some excellent application with cruise missiles (can get better than heavy missile application) and torpedoes. The typhoon fleet issue can do 1200-1700dps in a fairly unimposing package. 
---
Personally, i'd be happy with a full navy cruiser/battleship rebalance, i think we need to look at what the "Navy Faction" role really should be. I think they should get a little closer to what pirate faction ships can do as far as dps/speed, but leave the unique bonuses to the pirate ships.
---
So for example, you could have a navy raven with a 5-10% damage bonus with 7 launchers. It would do the same or more damage than the barghest, it just wouldn't have the scram range bonus or missile velocity bonus. So, its not necessarily a nerf to go from a navy ship to a pirate ship, but you would go to the pirate ship if you really wanted or needed the unique bonus.
---
It's like scooping anything else. You need to be within 2500m and have, in this case, 8000m3 of free space in your main cargo bay. Right-click the structure and scoop.
---
It used to be good anti-tackle, until ramjags.
---
&gt; Why in the hell would CCP make that change?
---
It's so they can market it better.
---
&gt; MFW people who have decent jobs irl still slave ingame for PLEX like some sort of obsession
---
MFW you have to spend your wages to buy an ingame currency in order to avoid wasting a lot of time.
---
Well there is no Destroyer class and all I ever fly is a Thrasher :( .  
---
Is this a player organized event or official one? I'm ok either way just asking because the site is on a free hosting.
---
As a newbean im excited to see this!
---
Well if you want to leave that corp as being open to war decs that is your choice.       And it will still matter as it makes it so other can war dec your corp before and after the next batch of changes.
---
Yes what indeed would I know about the CSM
---
It was posted here about 3-4 days ago
---
It's hosted by me and the team of guess over at EvE-CS.   
---
We've tried to get into contact with CCP but no one's really contacted me back yet.
---
It's not selling because it's massively overpriced 
---
Heres a top tip eveybody, never cancel contract to trade in person. You will always loose the fees because its a scam.
---
It has to do with neurological issues. Most people flying caps these days do not have enough brain cells to store spare cynos, industrials with cap boosters and dictors in sma.
---
It just works
---
Just keep it and move to delve once you're accepted. If you're not brain dead, it's easy moving caps
---
Hey look it's marshy's alt account again
---
We pressed f to kill not pay respects
---
No matter how much you press F, you aren't going to get a gate to lowsec
---
No it wouldn't, becaus it's a renter he Will not show up next war
---
Is that a 1v1 thing? What server is it on? Did you get promised support by ccp if it’s thunderdome? Why are you forcefully separating kite and brawl ships in your rules, sounds boring as fuck? 
---
showing up and being counted are two different things. On paper Panfam had and equal number of titans and supers last war. When the shit hit the fan they disappeared.
---
I don't expect big changes in the prices. It's more likely that they'll look at prices that don't fit the pattern of all the others and adjust those.
---
Who tf are you and why do you have my flair
---
Insurance
---
1v1, rules are on the website, Tranquility, CCP hasn't spoken to me about thunderdome. I'm separating kite and brawl because fights where a kite pilot just Orbits and twenty and kills a brawling pilot are 1. Boring to watch, and 2. Boring to fly in.  Sorry it sounds boring to you. Sounds like it aint ur kinda tournament. 
---
I don't even care if they ever put themselves in a position to become "food"; I appreciate 'em just for paying the bills. 
---
u/chribba will know. He has one. 
---
I quit the game in 2014 I put 15B into plex cards I think I paid 400-450.

Managed to stay sober for 4 years

Come back in 2018, plex cards are now 500 plex and its worth more than double.
---
MTUs are awesome, they even autoloot their owner's wreck
---
Mmmmmm sniper BS fleets back when probing was shit.
---
His CAOD posts back in 2006-9 were pretty awesome, shit was real back then )) 
---
Tick, tock...
---
if to you comfort and clarity are unnecessary then start sleeping on a rock. Don't forget to shut your trap about it as well.
---
Tbh 13 bil is an absolutely joke in comparison to the amount of work you put into building the hulls.
---
As someone who have made many hulls of supers and titans, the recent price development make it absolutely not worth it.
---
Consider you have a bpo worth 20-25 bil, then another 16-20 bil for the components. And on top of that you have the ore being locked for about a months time. All for a mere 10-15% profit. 
---
The accounts are old but had been inactive since about 2012. 
---
lmao
---
Sounds like poor design, you could easily persist a list of Jump Gates and the access lists they're apart of by some unique identifier. Initially, you'd need to do a lot of computational work to come up with the intial persistence, then you just need to add some code to persist access list changes and additional gates. 
---
From there you could easily accomplish this in O(logn) + O(V +E) time if you keep the lists presorted by their unique identifiers. 
---
This way you wouldn't have to do all that unnecessary computation and the cost of persisting the data is relatively cheap. Especially if you know what potential structures are on your route, and any structures farther than a straight shot would be mute to look up.
---
Knowing this, if you add the gates to the graph of Stargates and run your shortest path alg, the paths these gates created are just more nodes and edges, albiet special ones.
---
I'm assuming their shortest path alg is some implementation of BFS, so O(V + E) time. If a potential path youre considering has a gate which requires access, perform the O(logn) lookup from your persisted list, if it's accessible that particular edge is marked passible to your list of potential shortest paths. If you cant access that gate, you remove that edge by marking it impassible by the algorithm. You can do this safely in BFS, so long as mark it as passible/impassible before performing the next round.  
---
To be honest, you're not adding to much when you cut straight to the point of potential structures on your path, and checking for the access lists your apart of, whether it be a whitelist or a blacklist, you just need some unique identifier for that list. If a pilot was added to one, you'd update their pilot object with the uid of the list they're apart of. 
---
If CCP has this optimized, which my best guess is they do, they probably have a shortest-path tree between all nodes in new Eden, returning it to you in O(1) constant time. In which case, switching to a dynamic calculation of your path would be a costly but necessary swap. As you'd need to keep a shortest path tree for every possible combination of access lists. 
---
But from my perspective, by clicking the button they could implement the BFS style alg, as most people don't set destinations more than 30-50 jumps away. And your shortest path is either going to be the number of jumps, or shorter. You can probably spin this off on a thread client side. It would take at most, a few seconds. It gets longer when you start setting destinations from one end of new Eden to another. But how often to people actually do that? And to be honest, the graph routes through New Eden is not that large in comparison. 
---
If you want a nice O(1) lookup you'd have to keep that unchecked. But you can achieve a pretty fast lookup with some optimizations, particularly persisting a list of accessible gates and their access lists. 
---
Same. Got replied to on another thread, and I understand why they are griping, but I keep my distance and enjoy playing.
---
How are you planning on enforcing your rules on tq? You understand that the only way for your tournament to not get trashed by third parties is that it remains confidential enough that nobody gives a shit right? People have done it before with limited success (the pit) and given up in the end. And the most boring thing to watch is a vexor vs vexor tournament where everyone starts at 0 because some tournament organiser thought that watching kiting ships manoeuver around is supposedly trash. Fair 1v1 with limited fitting choices is extremely boring in eve as it’s pretty much a solvable problem with very limited skill ceiling as it’s really not demanding both mechanically and tactically. That’s the kind of content you get sitting in a faction warfare plex al day
---
If you want to get rid of it, sell it for less. Sold my Wyvern in less then 48 hours, bought a new super with the money and made the difference within a week. 
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
It's 420 Fountain Seconds I believe
---
yea there's one bad system but some of the stargates are on one side so it's not always bad to go through.  Still eating a 100 au warp every so often is way better than having to go 4 jumps for a mission regularly.
---
Your best bet is to go drop on Unspoken with it. Don't forget to loot their wrecks to make the 15bil quicker.
---
MATE apparently they called us pigs for some reason I didn't get the memo until local chat last night.  You have to impart some poasting onto them -  they are your allies and you're letting them live like this.  
---
I wonder if there are fleets like this for those on the European timezone, because unfortunately this will be 4am where I love.
---
[deleted]
---
Light missiles. What is wrong with you?
---
is fleet ship comrade because of stalinium armor. it has role, da? not erry ship need be all purpose. 
---
They left this out intentionally. They literally announced it at fanfest when the gates were announced.
---
Their reasoning was: they wanted to see how the gates would get used by the players before they added it to things like the auto pilot.
---
Hard to blame them, really. We do have a habit of not following they expectations when it comes to new features. 
---
idk I think they've been entosis'ing stuff and tempering expectations while finding their groove.  
---
Honestly Darkness (no flame just realtalk) probably would have formed similar numbers and gotten bombed to death.  
---
As someone who made a living feasting on the low-hanging fruit, always took a bit of time to readjust to normal people.  Looking forward to the future skirmishes, hope they stay this size though.  Local under 300 = my fav types of fights.
---
The powers that be failed to follow your leaders advice. Twist the knife and never remove your boot from your enemies neck. 
---
They let you dig into Delve rather than doubling down. Now they reap what they sow from their hesitation. \*shrug\*
---
Felt cute, might delete later
---
not at home watching twitch streams for a ded gaem. i can tell you that at least. 
---
The more ships destroyed, the rarer they become, the more expensive they get. Fite me.
---
Bosons can go while you’re at it. While they’d be awesome in a single player game, for multiplayer they’re just content denial writ large... More content for more players if it was an equivalent numbers response fleet mustered instead of one dude with a button.
---
so basically you're massively overpricing a travel-fit Hel
---
hulls are about 9b btw

This is a good thing... but, as with all things ccp, I’ll believe it when I see it.

Hey how’s your mom doing, her pussy heal alright after last night?

I think you actually bring up some good points, And honestly, I don't have answers to us getting hot-dropped on. If it happens it happens, so be it. More content for eve am i right? Also Yemnoa the organizer of the pit biomassed this year because of canceled AT. As far as the balance between kite-ships and Brawl-ships. This is an ongoing discussion between the balance team. Finding a sweet spot is hard. if it turns out badly we'll change rules down the line. 
---
&gt; Don't bother to vote
---
You don't know shit really
---
That's just competition and build proliferation. More builders, worse margins. 
---
Beautiful! Is your anti-aliasing on though? 
---
shut the fuck up
---
So you say you're using tools to give yourself an unfair advantage over all those players who keep entering all those ascii codes manually?
---
B0T are NC renters, we sold them the alliance in like 2016 or something
---
It is actually a very normal thing for tourniments to do. 
---
I know some people who had to turn off all their WoW addons because they knew they had to go with a totally unmodified client when at the tourniments. Even just cosmetic rearange-the-ui kind.
---
Yea or you can run highend wh stuff and make it in 2h or whatever
---
but I feel like a lot of folks are probably really bad at making isk and have a spacejob they hate, and would be better off liberated from it. 
---
15b is a crazy price for anyone that lives in any reasonably sized alliance
---
I'll buy it fullfit for 14, PC to casmeron khurelem
---
I don't mind bosons.  They don't really stop subcap fights from happening.  A higher spool up time maybe, but even that isn't really required
---
Nope. Counting the hull as 14B, I’m only making a 200 million markup according to evepraisal.
---
Don't mind that either, it's easy to kill heavy fibos
---
Over in TEST Space we have a scammer in local named "Freddie Caderu"
---
goons have a caderu also
---
before fred we had a "gary caderu"
---
The MER says we are better than the rest of the game.
---
Beep boop, boop beep beep
---
except in the current era of rorquals driving mineral costs lower and lower, hulls are closer to 10-11b now. 
---
No what I mean is that say you have perfect reprocessing skills. What compressed ores do I need to get to get a certain amount of minerals?
---
Uh, gottem?
---
&gt;not using your alts for pvp
---
lol
---
There is no RMT going. Check out his stream. He had this thing running once, realized it was wrong, changed it. Scince then he did nothing wrong. And due to the fact, all of us know CCP, he's a paying customer and won't be banned for something he has already corrected.
---
I can tell you they end every one of our subcap fights they feature in. Or were you not interested in facilitating smaller scale stuff too?
---
I would love to see the BS especially get a makeover. Some are so very close that it would be relatively trivial to get them into a place where they are viable in fleet or small gang. 
---
I mean its not the best return but thats your account plexed for the effort
---
You know I actually didn't check that .. but as you can see it's not on for sure ahah
---
Okay this is epic 😎
---
He's going to exact his revenge by killing a guy going on NPSI fleets, I guess
---
No I am, what are you in?
---
♥️
---
Was such a good time in EVE. Would be looking forward to whatever would happen, as he always made it so much cooler than anyone else managed. 
---
Its not that hard. 
---
Yeah no reason for me to omega since ftp came out
---
It was the glory days for sure, the threads would go wild, alliances would be accusing each other of shit all over the place, and it felt like the grind that wars can sometimes become kept their excitement because of the on-going forum battles. Then CCP took it away from us ( 
---
Leshak/Nestor are our typical core hulls. Even if you throw money at them you can’t survive a single boson without at least mid slaves. The fact that even fitting a complex brick tank gets you nowhere in surviving a boson is daft.
---
Yes, you can sacrifice much of the dps to hold range, and yes command destroyers help (I’d contend normal MJD is moderately impotent here given the spool time being same as boson), but at minimum I’d want to see damage numbers on a full boson drop so that if you had 150k+ EHP on a BS it could linger on in hull.
---
Oink
---
if you're buying a titan book in Jita and not from NPC orders you're just paying an idiot tax
---
&gt;  and the price is usually around the same.
---
don't think that's true
---
Stop making me like you! 
---
Grey text are actual fleet commands i was giving. Life is beautiful
---
You can get a dank active tank SNI. 
---
A good question but this post is just gonna get deleted
---
it wasn't a good post the first 2 times you posted.
---
They were triple boxing.
---
Same thing with the Marauders. A golem costs 1.5 bill but a rattlesnake can do pretty much the same tank with more dps. All t2 battleships should have a jump drive. Blops get them. 
---
I have the recording, it's true.
---
There is a reason why you have negative karma.
---
You should go back to being sub-human. This nice nice Doom is pathetic. 
---
Didnt the Maila keep get stolen by test?
---
Yeah you really can't use battleships in this meta without both local mjd and command dessies
---
haha our downvote brigade in full effect eh? mods delete this already
---
7 fountain minutes? you could have just said that...

It depends where you shop but yea his price is pretty meh

Real talk, half of the early deaths were people not aligning, not anchoring, going the wrong direction, half afk. Trying to save those morans cost a lot of alpha, and a lot of split attention. 
---
Always nice to hear about Ostingele.
---
That story also holds for a nano have doctrine and a drek doctrine (not to detract from the validity of you pointing out that tools exist)
---
I think that the state of play where you are entirely dependent on command destroyers to engage caps for fear of a Titan escalation is a consequence of bad mechanics, namely boson damage/existence.
---
There is no such thing as not having bias. Everyone leans one way or another, you just have to keep it in mind when reading from certain sources. This applies just as much irl as it does eve news.
---
r/legbeardthings
---
Oh boy you are too optimistic. I am afraid of the 64bit client because it will propably be a shitshow of bugs. The fact that it is delayed is just making me more uncomfortable.
---
holy shit you're worse than a goon   
---
stop spamming
---
True facts?
---
Dude, before they made the ingame item PLEX, you had people trading Game Time Cards through secure transfers CCP provided.
---
Well I don't necessarily disagree with you, but I don't rank that as high as some other ones because there are at least viable counters at the moment

It’s shit at F1 Fleet but still good at small/micro scale, decent dps with good projection.
---
Of course it’s really bad against ramjags like stitch says, but it’s still decent kite cruiser.
---
I see that scape all the time.
---
Agreed. Also a littlebit cheaper Navy bc/bs will be fine.
---
I feel like current Navy bc/bs are overpriced, even some of them have decent performance.
---
 I'll be playing a generic fps game as always

yeah but how bad do you have to be to struggle to make 65m a day?
---
HECKIN ROOD
---
It's a good point. However what I think is forgotten in that equation is that you have used time on it. And time + effort is worth something aswell. 
---
Most likely none of the changes that have happened in EVE lately have been related to Pearl Abyss. That's just CCP. 
---
As for changes, it has mostly been bad lately. If you want to see some big changes, wait for when the CSM Summit stuff starts coming out (which is probably in a few weeks). Personally I'm excited to see what that is, even if I am not a fan of what CCP has been doing for the last few months. Or years.
---
Not that I'm aware of
---
&gt;federation navy issue
---
when faction is not faction enough
---
Cool, will keep an eye out for the summit :) cheers for the heads up
---
How unreasonable of you ;) 
---
I think a lot of the issues with current gameplay stem from the design failure of not considering how an awesome idea intended for a niche use will be taken far beyond its envisioned use once out in the wild. This is an additional burden of designing for multiplayer (and further massively multiplayer as EVE is). 
---
The issue of tackle fighters/heavy fighter application is another one (again, probably not at the top of your list, different scale, different sore points) of these ‘cool in theory, completely removes player roles from the picture in practice’ ideas, that wouldn’t have the pain points it does in a single player game. Why do I need subcapital support ships if my carrier/supercarrier is all singing, all dancing? Yes, one can arduously defang, but wouldn’t it be better if those were players fighting instead of the fancy drones that outperform them?
---
Indeed, why play a mean trick on people and subject them to NSH?
---
I agree its pretty shit, but EW is the bigger problem for battleships. One frig with a TD that cant be caught for whatever reason will make your ship useless.
---
&gt;Please fix these useless ships ASAP.
---
This requires changing several values. So maybe in 2023? Or is that too optimistic?
---
First Amendment doesn't apply to platforms not owned by the US government you mouth breathing retard.

There have been some devblogs released recently. They've been fairly well accepted. (except by skill traders. They're not so happy)
---
From a slightly less public viewpoint (I'm on a focus group under NDA with CCP) I've not seen anything coming in from pearl abyss. 
---
CCP should buy the books back at npc sell order prices. No reason to create another speculation craze, but this time with infinite NPC sell orders 
---
Because of how broken AFs are now, larger ships are basically obsolete. The correct way to fix this is to nerf AFs, but people are too dumb to understand that, so we should go with the usual power creep and buff range and tracking (a fuckton) on all larger ships.
---
The difference being, with Wally, I come home in a ship instead of a pod.
---
I'm flattered you're in love with me and all but you need to take a break.
---
Instant travel is oppressive as a concept.
---
\o/ ships are meant to be flown. Sometimes the blow up sometimes they don’t. Risk adversity is a bullshit excuse. 
---
It's just that everyone has at least 500 alts these days.
---
Perhaps, but do you have excavators in your titans? 
---
Not really. Pretty much stagnant with the worse getting even worse (bots, injectors).

That's called PMS

how much are nyx hulls now

Shut up Marshy.

&gt;  I've not seen anything coming in from pearl abyss.

Ah so what are you saying is Pearl Abyss is forcing a lack of updates to funnel Eve players to their new MMO? Abandon ship!

Just join goons idiot

oh no u dihent

I have wasted 15 dollars on things way less fun for not as much time. That's literally two crappy drinks at the club.

Oh did not noticed that , your megathron federate issue 😂😂 my bad

protip, if you are going to use trade, put your hel in, have him put the money in, wait for the money dude to press accept.  He can't change the value after he's clicked accept. 
---
Yeah but you might as well use a rattler. 
---
U rly think about that? We came with small nano gang earlier and do some small kill-support in greed for goku fleet and nothing looted on wreck-field))). If u don’t  making some impact in this fight pls don’t make that stupid comms
---
No. CCP is being rubbish, but that's their modus operandi. 
---
Isn't that why people run them in carriers, so they can jump to thier cyno if something happens?
---
Navy BC are in a fairly good place right now tbh 
---
lol no 
---
Still requires a cyno and adds jump fatigue
---
Im sure it will be fine. CCP is no rookie when it comes to stable updates. Look at their accomplishments from 2003 till now.

Please. The mineral alone is worth more.

Went on vacation for a month, PC was off the entire time. Got home started it up and motherboard just fried.  It's the E God's way of kicking you in the balls whenever something good happens in your life. Sent it back to the manufacturer who sent it to China to be repaired. 6-8 weeks my ass, but it was an expensive board I can't just replace.

oh rip that sounds awful, hope the other components (cpu/ram/gpu) are fine

that was fucking fast rofl
---
Sure but there's no reason a FiBo should be able to track an afterburning assault frigate as easily as it tracks an MWDing battleship. Tweak it a bit so FiBos can track BC and above, incrementally; lights continue what they are doing (but in my opinion need to have their MWD nerfed from 14km/s to 5km/s). Shouldn't upset the krabbing crowd, but it makes a world of difference for smaller gangs being able to survive a bit longer.

Oh, Elo isn't that bad, just don't shoot his bridging Titan, he gets a little worked up about it.

Really? what's the focus group about? or do you just mean the csm?

Point granted.  Its just, this feels so much like the forced astroturf campaigns that have became so popular on reddit, as well as the wider internet these last few years.  I mean, it feels that way because it is one, this one is just particularly obvious and super heavy handed. Seeing the shit in action, especially this unsophisticated low rent version, pisses me off.

Its like instead of learning basic social skills and interacting with others, a few obsessive asspies have decided to go full gevlon and cant understand that "mod bias" is against shit in general, not only against their specific and endlessly spammed flavor.

For the botting i think many many alliance try to clean shit but it s not easy. In init (especialy IA) we kicked 3 corpo in 6 month and many individual pilot, tnt did some, rate my ticks too. It s not an easy task.
---
I think all alliance eventhought red together must work together to counter the bot invasion.
---
And remove isk from wallet alliance / corpo is very good.

You're not wrong. It's pretty easy to spot vote / comment manipulation once you start clicking user profiles. Some are legitimately new accounts though so it's important to remember that, naturally.

Basically every "goon mod bias" thread is created by the same 2 people - Olmeca and Marshy. Marshy has been permabanned for a year and instead just constantly recreates alts and spews his garbage. He's over half of the ban list at this point.

Imagine being so unemployed that you have that kind of free time.

All sounds familiar, like a comfortable slipper.

It is one of the reasons for crashes once you start getting a few hundred on grid (and why potato mode is a necessity) the game starts trying to address more memory than 32 bit can handle and crashes.  64 bit can address orders of magnitude more memory.

Yeah and we are against that, which is why we have ansibilex gates which cannot be camped without being insta popped by structures, and titan bridges which cannot be stopped if they only bridge.

Yeh they have that incredible base buffer and extra fitting/slots 
---
And a little drinking
---
Directly? No. There's nothing, good or bad, that players can point to yet and say "This is definitely a result of CCP being purchased by Pearl Abyss."
---
Indirectly? There are three things worth watching to see if they're one-offs or trends.
---
1. The ["13 Days of EVE"](https://www.eveonline.com/now/winter-2018) event at the end of 2018. From a "give us free shit!" standpoint that EVE players judge every year-ending event on, this event was a total success. How do you know? Not a single player complained about it. ;-) Still, the way the event was designed, it strongly encouraged every EVE player to log in with every one of their EVE accounts, both Omega and Alpha. The event *might* have been designed that way to drive in unique log-ins as a basis for some metric in the Pearl Abyss acquisition contract.
---
2. The latest [Guardian's Gala event](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/yc121-guardians-gala-or-how-not-to-run-an-event/140007) this year. The reward structure for this event was a little suspicious and unlike the reward structure for previous EVE events. In particular, accessing the rewards meant farming a new type of named "event ticket" item to open something that acted very much like a "loot box". This is suspiciously similar to [how rewards are structured](http://dulfy.net/2018/01/03/black-desert-flurry-of-snowflakes-event-guide/) in Black Desert Online, Pearl Abyss's MMO, which also uses named event tickets to open loot boxes. This may be coincidence and may be a direction CCP had planned on turning in despite the purchase based on industry monetization trends.
---
3. One of the [more-respected articles](https://venturebeat.com/2018/09/06/black-desert-online-creator-pearl-abyss-acquires-eve-online-maker-ccp-games-for-425-million/) regarding the purchase explicitly mentions that EVE's employee count is 250 people spread between Reyk, London, and Shanghai. Meanwhile, several months later, the most recent [EVE Pulse video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0XKolBAhdQ) as CCP Burger (EVE Creative Director) stated that there are "about 220" CCP employees in Reyk working on EVE. This could be a mistake or approximation in the first article, an overstatement on Burger's part, CCP might have added additional staff in Reyk with some of the buyout money, or CCP might have been in the midst of staffing up when they were purchased. There's no way to know which of these four statements is the correct one.
---
So, yeah. Nothing direct but there's some data points worth watching.

The idea of a frontline has been brought up many times and I like the idea of that. It might have some problems as well but it would be a change for once and we need something. It would also help to get the few groups that are left into a certain area. 
---
The structures are a problem and having some sort of mechanic specific for FW-groups would be nice. Just disabling their structures or making them more vulnerable wouldn´t help to as alt corps are a thing. 
---
At this point I would be happy if CCPlease would just do ANYTHING...
---
there is 1, maybe 2, gsf aligned mods for this subreddit.

/u/dumbdwarf is the most goon aligned mod.

Got blapped pretty early (around the time of the planet 5 bounce) by the wall of Munnins, but was still a fun fight. Being close to home I came back in a Retri and motored around being annoying. Thank you Wally and others for a great fleet, and thank you to all the combatants for committing to a gud fite. 
---
Thanks for that in-depth commentary. It's exactly the insight I was hoping for. Cheers buddy.
---
It's now free to play, but you'll be an alpha if you don't buy the monthly premium, as an alpha you have some limits indeed.
---
PL is turbodead. It’s just hedliner multiboxing this whole fleet. 
---
banderlogs did a thing that happened?
---
Which of the kills was you?
---
Sure, if you want to be a scrub. 
---
Jesus, that Vid is from like 2013.
---
We're not all as good @ math as u ok???
---
Just like Lazerhawks and hardknocks have botters in Cobalt Edge, Building titans up there in CHP
---
You probably were early in the process before CCP decided it wasn't worth the effort and reverted all the characters to their old names.
---
I don't know exactly when it happened between 2015 and the release of Alphas, but by the time I gained access to all my old free trials (the release of Alphas) they had all their old names.
---
MFW people run more rorqual alts so they can run more rorquals alts.
---
CCP's attempt to steer new players towards a weapon type that requires a little bit of piloting to use most effectively as opposed to just becoming f1 orbit monkies. 
---
Yeah, honestly it took me a year + to even figure out who all the intricate mechanics of all the weapons work, and I didn't learn how to manipulate tracking til a few months ago. They really should make both sides equal or steer towards missiles first because who doesn't love missiles.
---
F is also the standard key to have your drones attack anything. Given its official origin and its function in the game it even becomes funnier.
---
Maybe you should become a moderator to input your own bias
---
I think your mixing up horde with goons buddy 
---
If you ask in the new beans there will typically be a person willing to teach new beans. If not join horde and I’ll guide you through the start^^
---
What if I am mate? 
---
It already does. I'll grant it isn't "100 hp repped (100 ignored)"
---
But the message for remote armor, shield and cap all tell exactly how much assistance you give (I didn't bother to check remote hull, but I imagine it does too).
---
If the target has full cap/armor/shield the combat log will show:
---
    20:30:00	Combat	0 remote capacitor transmitted to SumScrub  - Small 'Regard' Remote Capacitor Transmitter
---
    20:30:00	Combat	0 remote armor repaired to SumScrub - Small Coaxial Compact Remote Armor Repairer
---
    20:30:00	Combat	0 remote shield boosted to SumScrub - Small Murky Compact Remote Shield Booster
---
If you're flying logi, you should have a bit of an idea of how much a full rep should be, and then you can investigate if the lower than expected rep is due to "overhealing" or some scrub just being way off anchor and in deep falloff.

Actually I think comparing two systems works fine, but I can see why you'd think I was asking for it given my wording :D

I was trying to compare Jita and BWF-ZZ, which has a keepstar that's private. 
---
yes obvs
---
Ok thanks

---
I tried to make fun post, but nothing is as hilarious aa mar5hy
---
You know, nobody here woulda known or cared, but you just had to make a thread about it...
---
UALX: it went so bad for Panfam, they choose to acknowledge it doesn’t exist.
---
Ok thats also good to hear of course :-) but we might add it because it could be a nice option ;).
---
About the Keepstar in BWF-ZZ its a different story since its a private structure. We are very limited with the structure we can index and also the orders on the structures with the public API's available. In a future version where we will add the EVE Online SSO this might change because players can grant us access to get those details.
---
1.bots dont build titans.
---
2. Show me where hawks have renters or botters?
---
I don't think a fleet tempest getting a 50% bonus to tracking is the counter to AF's, nor is buffing range/tracking on larger ships.  
---
I think most AF's are well balanced, the only one that is an annoyance is the jaguar. Some simple tweaking of speed and/or sig could go a long way to help deal with them. Nothing really needs to be done on other ships to fix that.
---
If by larger ships, you mean battleships, the main thing they need to help "defang" a smaller ship is scan resolution. The issue with a lot of battleships is you can't do shit against a small ship for 15-30s as it barrels down on you. Battleships have lots of options to help counter frigates, the issue is that you can't use any of them since every small ship has gone through speed creep and battleship scan res hasn't been looked into to compensate. Take for example a rokh or scorpion navy issue, they have 93mm scan res. The same as a nidhoggur (before NSA) and less than a naglfar. It takes them a good 20-23seconds to lock an MWD interceptor. Take a pretty typical interceptor speed of 5k/s. At 100km, an interceptor can burn in, point/scram before the battleship can even have it locked. If it gets to scram/nos range, then a heavy neut is near worthless, as long cycle time can be countered with fast nos cycle. So your only option is to warp off and try to reposition.   
---
It also makes it hard to support a gang sometimes. I use battleships a lot in small gang, and i find it frustrating when someone is like "hey, need to kill this guy, apply dps" and i'm just thinking "alright, gimme 20s gotta lock him up first".
---
By no means should battleships like in 10s, but a buff to scan resolution for all battleships i think would help a lot more than people expect without shifting stats around on ships that can create a domino effect in other areas.
---
Note: Before someone mentions it, yes i do use SEBO's and Sig amps, it helps some, but as they are % based, a % increase to 93mm is still pretty shit. You'd need multiple scan res mods, which then starts cutting into tank/damage/application etc, just to not lock like a capital ship.
---
It was possibly a short time after Alpha release then. I think I petitioned after a couple of days.
---
I don't remember anymore :D

---
Can confirm
---
You're right bots don't build the titans. The People running them do.
---
While you are at it can you make torps apply to everything too? AFs are great fun and one of the best changes CCP has made in the past years. I guess the Retri could use some slignt nerfs but I'd rather have it like it is right now than it being unusable again.
---
Brief AAR: Tau and the boys were playing a game of apex when drinking vodka when the batphone rang about some big brawl going down in PB ,luckily tau sucks at PUBG so he died quickly and was ready to go.We jced into our PB capital cache and at that moment SIBSQ dropped their load and we went in with INIT coming in slightly later fragged what we could before our Hics and Dics had eaten shit. Wierdly instead of shooting SIBSQ supers tri just shot us and slowly began extracting while it was going on. NCPL eventually arrived in a big ferox fleet because their super FCs all quit eve and INIT sacrificed T3s so all our caps could extract. GF GF
---
nice karma whoring hy
---
Apex #1
---
Keep in mind that really a lot of it is down to individual player playstyle and preference. For example, using Hiivas, I don't like it though it works out for some people.
---
Reason I don't like it is that while it ups your overall DPS, it lowers your primary weapon platform DPS and lowers your long range DPS, thus vs battleships. I often kill battleships with drones only while flying a Gila using 3x Faction DDAs and Augmented Hammers. There are very few that require me to actually time my missile reloads and unload a full load on them to get them down faster. The drone battleship is the one I have to do this the most to punch through its armor.
---
So do experiment with different fits until you find one that works best for you, all these things are just guidelines, not something set in stone.

Oh come on, the only thing funnier than watching Olmeca pick fights with admins and lose is watching someone trigger marshy and you know it.
---
I'm waiting for this to involve hawks some how? Or did you just hear something on comms someday and thought yeah that's true?
---
200+ people in Reyk working on EVE? From a 0.0 space point of view and even considering the usual overhead that seems like a lot of people for basically no bigger (positive) changes for over a year? Thank god at least converting all POS modules to "Upwell structures" is finally done. After fixing chat and releasing the 64 bit client they have hopefully "modernized" eve enough for now and can maybe get back to developing new stuff AND start a balancing pass for all other 0.0 gameplay-systems (resource abundance / rorquals / capitals / etc...). Come on CCP! 
---
Meh. Its funnier to see them post their own sperg thinking its Ulysses or something.
---
:) 
---
Lets just go with a little bird told me. She had a special whistle. So I went and checked it out. That birds tune was right on point.
---
You can say what you want about EVE, and I could say plenty... but one thing everyone can agree upon is it sure is pretty. 
---
They can be done in pair of T3Cs, Bharghests, a good blingy long range tank BS + recon, couple other set ups. It all depends on how many missions you want to accept vs how many you want to decline. Declining too many is a pain in the ass cause then you need to have an army of mission pullers, and those pullers themselves will have their standings reduced too and you have to either switch them or grind them back up which sucks major ass.
---
&gt;Wierdly instead of shooting SIBSQ supers tri just shot us and slowly began extracting while it was going on.
---
Had to shoot something until we could jump the dreads out! and our little dread group was not going to make much work on them Supers that was +50km or so away from us
---
&gt; They really should make both sides equal or steer towards missiles first because who doesn't love missiles.
---
In my personal experience, EVE PVP was never better than when a couple of hundred people could get into nano drakes and pew each other on the cheap (all while trying to dodge bombing runs).
---
waaaaaaaaaait your in tri now wtf

So where are hawks botters?

let's see.. who would I rather shoot.. snuff or SIBSQ.. snuff every time

That line that's been said after every time someone feeds is a bullshit excuse. Maybe you just need strong FCs to lead the way like Anure and not some mongoloid crying because he got dropped on by Iron and leaving fleets in the middle of an engagement because it got to hard for him.

i am not fighting on imperium side tho but neato tool thanks

If only Physics was a thing in EVE, then I'd stop playing KSP and actually use my titan
---
I'm almost feel like this would have been most appropriate with a Minmatar ship.
---
*"So, how exactly did you electrocute half your crew?"*
---
Then I'll keep reporting him until he gets banned.
---
you would miss me
---
Nothings really happened apart from getting the AT cancelled 
---
This is good for T3s. for T4s and higher you will need to get away from Tech II stuff and go more faction / bling.
---
Also few pointers, thukker batteries are much better then republic fleet, they give more resist and provide more cap. 
---
Large shield booster unnecessary and will drain your cap super fast and is almost unusable in full neut spawn. Go with medium a-type, I forgot which but one of them is super cap efficient and doesnt eat up PG/CPU.
---
You don't need the tracking link unless you intend to run dark filaments. Use default Vespas on everything, Hammers for BCs and battleships. Exception is if you have low drone support skills. But at maxxed skills you don't need it. Stick a large faction extender in there, or even a second ward.
---
Dont need that many cap rigs once you switch to medium booster. Go with 2x solidifiers and 1 cap rig. Tech I and Tech II, check various HP/s /cap use combos.
---
Maybe better to go with a single B-type invuln and eitehr EM or Therm ward. This will also save you cap.
---
Faction AB for a bit of extra speed and less cap use, deadspace is better, but faction is cheaper.
---
Drones: Keep 3 flights of Vespas, so x6, 2 flights of hammerheads, so x4. Augmented hammerheads do a lot of DPS, by far, and do both kinetic and thermal damage, but they have trouble hitting targets below cruiser size. vespas hit them fine. So use hammers on Battleships. Augmented Vespas have a ton better application and ton more HP then Tech II. Ifyou are short on ISK, then just get 1 flight of each and keep rest of drones Tech II. See the difference.
---
Quafe and Blue Pill do not stack, they use same booster slot if I remember correctly and you don't need Quafe. Its very expensive. If you want more speed just invest in a better AB instead. A 40 mil AB is like buying 4 quafe and will last, unlike quafe. Alternatively, you can use the agency speed booster for a bit more, the agency boosters use booster slot 11 and will stack with blue pill. You can even use Hardshell agency booster I or II,dirt cheap, and stack it with standard blue pill for even more tank efficiency.
---
With the medium a-type booster you run your booster always, you dont need to manage it except maybe overheat occasionally because your whole fit becomes compeltely stable.
---
Except I've never seen a Minmatar gun malfunction.
---
This is one of the best changes CCP has made in years, especially with the addition later this month (I think) that prevents neutral logi. I've done a lot of war dec'ing, and this change was absolutely needed.

&gt; He convoed me one day, saying he'd buy it for 15B. We settled for 15.275B. I canceled the public contract and he opened the trade window. Hel on top, 15 275 000 000 isk bottom. Just as I was about to click accept, he changed billions to millions. His cunning strategy was defeated by my supreme dexterity however, and I told him to fuck off.

The most important change would be to prevent people from anchoring structures in hostile (or neutral) FW space, or to prevent hostile militia members from docking in structures as a minimum.

---
i can't believe how two autists triggered the imperium so hard that 50% of the posts made by goon posters is about them
---
o that's true. Tbf i just shamelessly stole the first one linked in fleet chat, gave it a real quick look and that's it.
---
It would be interesting to see actual fleet preformances versus the simulation. Like do better fc'd fleets have a 5% better outcome or a 15% better outcome. 
---
I'll have two of whatever you're on.
---
170 feroxes volley any subcap doctrine but faction battleships these days. If INIT. were to use BS they'd get the Panfam super hammer on them every subcap fight, loose loose situation.
---
I think the mod should sign a "free super for everyone" bill
---
Here, this farms all T4s except dark like a champ. It does best in Electrical, which still enables you to sell off all your exotic, gamma filaments for extra ISK and electrical is not as expensive as these 2. For implants on it, I use 5% missile ROF, 5% cap implants (volume and regen), rest shield. You can start with running Standard Blue Pill, once you get comfortable, stop using it, but keep it in your cargo for those "o shit" times.
---
Important note about fitting: Wherever you can, do not fit active modules next to each other, fit active &gt; passive &gt; active &gt; passive &gt; active &gt; passive etc. Reason for this is how heat damage spreads during overheating. If you overheat an active module it will start doing heat damage, and you want to minimize the damage your otehr active modules take, let the passive ones soak up a bit of it. Going further, fit passive modules with most structure points between 2 active modules.
---
I like using the NOS here vs drifter and drone battleships, always end up with full cap or close to it so don't have to wait at the gate for cap regen before jumping. Saves some time. While you orbit final battleship, you will not be getting hit at all, so turn off your tank, all of it, to start cap regen for next room. only keep AB on.
---
For T5s, switch everything you can for A-Types, including the AB, add implants, go to better boosters then standard.
---
For Fire filaments, switch extender to thermal ward, but you will have lower shield so have to watch it, rely more on piloting, keeping at range. Or keep the extender and switch the EM Ward to thermal, but then you will take some extra EM damage from certain spawns. Occasionally overheat your AB for a cycle or 2 to get out of range of Vedmaks, this is very important. Switch drones to 3x Hammerheads, 2x Vespas as Hammers really shine in fire.
---
For dark T3s and T4s, switch extender to Drone Tracking Link and leave it in default, no scripts, but you have to watch your tank and cap like a hawk. You will have to do some extra piloting and each pocket with small targets in it will consume on average 1-2 minutes extra. This set up can not do Dark T5s.

Not sure if thats accurate. They are straight up overpowered.

Until you realize your Battlebuddy is a Gallente person then it just gets awkward once he sees it.

I like 2 hiivas and one faction dda, or 1h, 2 dda just cuz the battleships don’t usually give me problems, I’d rather be able to clear little stuff quicker, especially neuts and webs since i use an ab most of the time... with mwd, also the scrams. But shieldwise, pith booster, gist amplifier, 2 gist invuls, and a gist ab or mwd works in the mids for me. 2 Shield boost rigs and one cap rig. Bling up to skills/wallet limits. Also sorta requires some crystal implants for doing t5s comfortably, though you can get away without the super pricy ones if you’re just doing electric and exotic filaments. I like having some missile damage also since the tessera drone waves wreak havoc on my drones, so I have to pull them back a fair amount in t5s. Only lost ships due to turkish internet connection or netflix related negligence with this fit.
---
Not in America

okay?

I have yet to see an overpowered ship that isnt considered "fun" by retards. They are too fast for that kind of tank or maybe even in general. You need a BS to kill them, but it cant track.

and to enjoy eve just do what you want   although there are the more efficient ways to make money dont go to them if you dont enjoy them i would give exploration a try wonce you go trough the career missions its not a bad source of income and can be really enjoyable 
---
fly safe newbro o7

&gt;I don't think a fleet tempest getting a 50% bonus to tracking is the counter to AF's, nor is buffing range/tracking on larger ships. 
---
At least you would have a chance on paper. But you are probably right, it wouldnt be enough given how fast they are. They have no real counter.
---
&gt;I think most AF's are well balanced, the only one that is an annoyance is the jaguar. Some simple tweaking of speed and/or sig could go a long way to help deal with them. Nothing really needs to be done on other ships to fix that.
---
What can fight them and actually win? BS is irrelevant because you cant hit anything, or you get dropped on. Cruiser cant really catch if it is tanky enough to survive a small pack, or we are talking 300m+ to engage 3-4 AFs, and three get away.
---
What other ships of the same size can fight them? You used to be able to have a good fight in a dessie, but now its basically pointless because of the invuln.
---
They are currently the ultimate zero risk max reward ships.
---
&gt;Battleships have lots of options to help counter frigates, the issue is that you can't use any of them since every small ship has gone through speed creep and battleship scan res hasn't been looked into to compensate.
---
The scan res is a problem, but doesnt matter. You are just not killing 2-3 AFs + some EW frig and maybe a logi. BCs and cruisers also have issues.
---
Yeah it looked close but slightly off, thanks for the tip
---
hey it could just be another marshy a lot dodging his ban. We'll never know they are both goon obsessed gelvon wannabes 
---
&gt;Preferably, id like to see CCP rebalance all navy battleships.
---
They did say not too long ago they will be rebalancing or at least "looking at" all navy ships, not just battleships. But you know... Just because they said ....
---
We’re like dogs chasing cars.

" It seems like every day I play this game I run into Goonswarm members  autistically screeching about how they are the best at the game, how  everyone else sucks, etc.  " You must be getting flair baited on Reddit, because we suck and we know it. I mean come on, we lost a re-enforcement timer to a fucking POS mechanic last year, who the fuck does that besides us?
---
Well there's the usual pre-PMS lead-in, the PMS actual and a post-PMS lead-out. So practically close to permanent, yea.
---
"[CHARACTERNAME] is going to be living on a farm upstate where he can run and play."
---
Nice fight there a br to go along with this?
---
Since when did Eve ships have crews?
---
Do you happen to have a link to the first lore story you mentioned in this post?
---
The venture icons disappeared for me. Was that only temporary?
---

---
Since ever. Don't tell me you've been reloading your weapons by hand yourself like a pleb?

---
Honestly if I have to keep reading this crap I'm gonna join gsf and join a sig that's sole purpose is to fuck with him. 
---
I've only been back 4 months and gone from thinking the dude was pretty funny and it was just banter/persona but I'm genuinely starting to worry for the dude it's a straight up obsession for him. 
---
Seriously dude it's just a game and I get you love the game but you are coming across to the general eve player as a unstable conspiracy nut, take a month off if not the game then at least the sub and look after yourself
---
I don't use weapons.
---
The always have.  Even frigs have a handful of crew, Titans, a few thousand
---
You misspelled Mr. Krabs
---
Huh, I've always thought only the capsuleer was the only one Manning the ship. 
---
Feels like I’m schizophrenic, I could swear I saw kills with multiple pilots, on unspoken kb, in delve. Too lazy to look it up tho so I’m trusting you.
---
Eve should be just been a interactive wallpaper 
---
some can't even manage to get into a ship before undocking for a fleet on the first try.
---
👉😎👉
---
Boy you sure got a pretty mouth! 
---
Yep but hey what's a few millions lives to immortal capsuleers 
---
free speech?  on reddit?  lol.
---
heres a tip, theres a thing called https://dissenter.com/ that we use to post comments on pages without having said sites censoring us.
---
cause literally every site is censor happy seeing free speech as a bad thing.   its sad
---
Calling out NC/PL for not bringing supers while you still hug goons for safety :ok\_hand:
---
People cant see past what benefits their clique in eve.
---
You mean you're hosing out your pod goo *personally* when you dock up?  You're supposed to have underlings for that sort of thing.
---
(I do wonder how notorious suicide gank fleets would recruit non-capsuleer crews though.)
---
Don't openly post about things like this, you might get banned
---
We use the advanced science of stargates and unpredictable whims of wormhole space to sometimes roam the promised krab lands, this is true.
---
CCP: introducing the new ancillary data analyzer 
---
Praise James!
---
It was just a standard boring data site in jspace. On of the sparkling transmitter types if I remember rightly.
---
So did I, and then one late night on comms I learned about how they have dull crew compliments.
---
So if I place a bounty on someone of 10m then the bounty will stay in effect until the value of their loss is greater than the bounty I placed?
---
I mean it's possible to have crews for structures but ships don't drop any corpses when they die/get salvaged so I thought they don't have crews, and not even a single bit of biological material is used to manufacture ships.
---
Nice kill!  Reminds me of a death I had recently.  Warped to kill a mobile tractor unit.  Didn't notice the guns and Disruptor on me from station.  Died to guns from said station.  My 1bil ship got scooped into the mobile depot.  Good times.
---
It's literally not that hard to retain new players if the NPE actually taught people basic EVE mechanics and had a useable UI any retard could use with actual fun highsec content for newbies/intermediates that encourage social interactions
---
Just another case of CCP being retarded tbh
---
I killed some guy sitting inside jspace at a wormhole in some T1 frigate. I looked at his loot and he had civilian analysers and stuff like that. With a sense of horror I looked up his character and he was only a few days old. I gave him twenty times his losses in ISK but I still feel dirty about it.
---
It’s the Alliance your in TBH. GSF botting rorqs probably shit out 8 Hels in a hour. The conflict in PB is one of the more interesting ones lately. 
---
You're fucking high.
---
Think so, but people are getting paid only a tiny portion of whatever the bounty is, including ship value
---
Missiles are the shittiest weapon system there is in the New Eden cluster. Which is why 85% of the Caldari ships (the ones getting bonuses to launchers) are trash. Like the whole Guristas line.
---
I know what you meant just seeing that term used in reference to a video game struck me as a bit odd :)
---
I have said skills.  Own some structures to do all activities.  I was just looking for some spread sheets to complete this since I am feeling kind of lazy.  I will try to make my own, but it would be nice to just copy and paste to see what other people have done to make it work.  
---
High on life try having one
---
That's nice.
---
If other people worked hard to create their own spreadsheet, not a lot will be willing to share it, trust me.
---
who ever assumed my gender shall be shamed then hehe 
---
The new player experience has improved ten fold over the past few years. I'd actually suggest you make a new toon and check it out, it's very impressive compared to the good old days ;) but yeah, overview could use a little tweaking. I honestly think the main thing CCP should introduce is saved screen layouts, which players can then load/save based on what they're doing.. doing exploration click a button opens up all the correct shit and lays it out in an optimal way etc. 
---
Thanks. 
---
His streamlabs rewards page is still up. Giving away ingame items based upon points that can be earned by subscribing (paying) is the very definition of RMT.
---
Double left click along the top of the window, or press windows key+down arrow to restore down
---
No, no, NO. INIT planned to feed those t3's for like the last year. Tell the truth.
---
No really noticable ones, there was that loot crate thingy in the event, but it didn't catch on so I think we're good
---
Which, admit it, is probably a good thing.
---
Nah. Just posting in a happy go lucky post is Al mate.
---
Make the window active and hit alt+enter
---
Lololol, it's you that needs a doctor. The profit is realized by CCP when someone purchases it in the store, not when it's "consumed" within the game. Real world example, when you buy a cheeseburger at McDonald's that is when they profit, not when you eat it.
---
ya goons r very close with their supers to minmitar lowsec. Also PL has less supers than horde if youre actually in PL so pls stick to feroxes thx.
---
Do you have a larger resolution?
---
Now, please don’t take this the wrong way... but if you really truly have only played Eve and GW2 over the last 7 years, I would recommend trying at least a few of the classics that have come out in that time. 7 years is a long time in the gaming world. By all means, keep playing Eve, but there are some games out there like Portal and Gone Home the you can finish in just a few hours and will be very much worth your time. :)
---
 Just a small heads-up, currently we are working on the Fittings module in our website.  
---
You will be able to upload fittings using the EFT / PyFa file standard (which you can export with EVE) and share them on our website. 
---
[You can see the preview on our topic @ the EVE Online Forums](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/eve-workbench/142249/9?u=lionear_maricadie)

Sure, here you go. https://i.imgur.com/SG8JM2O.png -- it's been retouched and slightly upscaled.
---
I will most likely be turbo-krabbing....
---
&gt;Doesn't commit supers
---
  UALX? I remember PL/NC and friends crying we were blobbing by dropping all our supers on their asses...
---
1000 hours through steam and plenty of plex bought through them and I have never had any problems, all it does is open the launcher anyway.
---
There is no buyout money _for CCP_. CCP didn't sell themselves to PA. Their owners sold them to PA.
---
However, I will say: Lot of new faces :)
---
Somehow Mar5hy will reeeeeeeeeee out of this
---
As a new bro the biggest early ISK makers are exploration and gas mining, preferably in Wormholes. Skill requirments are low and it's a lot of fun. It will also help you understand dangerous areas of space in ships that cost around 1 million ISK each. 
---
How about undocking to find fights?
---
Should post that here - [https://www.reddit.com/r/eveporn/](https://www.reddit.com/r/eveporn/)
---
He's claiming that PA are going to force CCP to sell AT ships, for PLEX (or real money).
---
I have seen _no_ signs of this. It's entirely tinfoil, possibly built off the fact it happened on Serenity (which was run by a different company, due to Chinese law)
---
Maybe that's what's happeneng right now
---
Its less mundane than INITs deployment so far
---
I have been trying to catch new players and bring them content myself by fleeting up, and taking them around High-sec and low sec areas to PVE and PVP.  It gets hard to do when some of their first interactions with other players is getting ganked or scammed right away.  
---
new overview settings went in a few months ago.
---
Exploration is also a big early game money maker in Elite, though it lacks any wormhole systems to explore. But it’s more than made up for by the size of its galaxy.
---
Ok goonie 
---
shes quite good @ numpad though
---
about as much as i miss marinate
---
How about no?
---
Not saying you couldn't do that. I don't see these 2 methods are exclusive to each other. You want to undock, you can still undock, fight for your alliance, hunt bot , gank freighters, fight for either of the four factions, conquer new systems, you can still do these things with greater reward and probably more satisfaction depends on who you are and what you like.
