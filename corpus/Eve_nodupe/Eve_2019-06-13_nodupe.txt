You really have no idea. If you hated PL so much in 09 why were you begging for a none aggression pact. You goons really do get spoon fed some shite.

If your organization didn't have people around to time your pos, then it should have found trusted people that could handle it.
---
No it is not that. Like look at the nyx police skin. It is supposed to be white and blue (you know.. boys in blue) but because the environmental light in the preview window is green it looks dark gray and loses a lot of its appeal. Luckily people learned by now to look at skins in the preview window from all angles possible and at some point you do get to see the actual colour....

We always timed our towers, unusally frantically while 20-30 dreads tried to one cycle it bellow 50%. Numbers are hard, mistakes were made, fights were had, sometimes alarm clocks were set.
---
Don't fly what you can't afford to lose lol.
---
No thanks.
---
Imagine waking up like 5am to fix stront timer, or to defend your POS because your stront guy forgot his duty while drinking beer...
---
citadel spam is cancer also we need more vulnerable citas for sure (especially asstrahus and raitaru)
---
but I don’t miss stront timer and I never will.
---
Good defenders decided the timer, better attackers could try and effect the timer by kiting, even better defenders could prevent that by finishing the RF or repairing and re-timing.
---
Attackers decided the day, unless they were so bad that they didn't even finish the RF.
---
 I'm pretty sure none of these techniques were predicted by CCP and in hindsight they probaby didn't even know its what we did. Complex immergent gameplay.
---
Not really you use your enemies structures to build and move it to your space.
---
A lot of goon players/leaders gave feedback immediately following the announced release of those new gates explaining how that would work out and what the results would be. And as is tradition CCP ignored it all and released it as is.
---
It really never stop being funny that people say they won't vote or participate in the CSM process because its a waste of time and has no meaningful effect and then turn around 1 patch later and blame the "GoonSM" for ruining the game, it would be nice if they could make up their minds just this once.

If they hit it when you were asleep, then your default timer should have made it exit when you were awake.

We mostly used instasvipuls, caracals, spearfishing Boosh teams and in one instance a booshed pipe bomb fleet in saranen discounting the occasional drive-by Titan from NC/pl*. I agree with the rest though.

---
Wtf why
---
Amen brother, in a game where we cannot die, the bravest person dares to fail. Fuck safety, it will kill a good Alliance faster than any war.
---
Ok lets run with this bad idea.  
---
So we have 1000 dps frigates, and 1000 dps destroyers, and 2000 dps HACs, we would need something on the level of LR Dread or T2 Carrier burst (4000 dps)?  Or would we be going higher, say 6000 dps?
---
Ok, so we have a cruiser hull, with 6000 dps.  Whats the target sig?  20km (supers), 10km(caps).
---
Well lets just be lazy and give a stealth-bomber faction XL torps in pyfa and see what the result is.  An 800dps purifier becomes a 7500 dps purifier.  Not a terrible start.  
---
Whats this, we now have a ship that does 50,000+ alpha to freighters, and its cruiser size...  RIP highsec.  You would be down to like 2 people to gank in 0.5.  Seems like it would also take over wormhole space...  Anti-fax, anti-structure, small mass.  
---
Then, what is to stop anyone from just using these new op ships.
---
I'm new, still learning Eve, but might have some insight. Eve is a game that's very much like real life. Basically, the time and effort you invest directly results in how succesful you are in your goal, generally. So, if I want to be a doctor for a "decent" hospital, I'd probably have to work my ass off day in and day out for 10 years to get anywhere. That being said, in Eve, I'm sure a lot of players didn't just "become" famous one day. They were active in their respective communities, and made an impact. Not a crater, but a lot of small impacts over the course of many years can still change a landscape. 
---
One thing I think you're running into here, is Eve is a proud game. I mean no disrespect when saying that, by the way. I simply mean, those who are considered "experts" or "gurus" in Eve probably spent the better of 6+ years to get there. That's a lot of time to invest (especially if it's like 3 hours on weeknights and all weekend), not counting all the extra effort put into it. All this is a lot for any videogame, but for a sandbox game like Eve, where nothing is handed to you and a lot of the content is player created? That's something to be proud of, especially considering how long it's lasted.
---
So that's like me sorta waltzing into Johns Hopkins Medical Center, and asking "So yeah, I want to be like, the best doctor at Johns Hopkins, you know, bench with plaque and everything man, where do I start?".
---
Not trying to be mean, but to get "Eve Famous", hell, even to make a substantial impact requires an INCREDIBLE amount of effort and time, just running a decent sized Corp can be a headache, let alone going for gold (I'm assuming, never ran shit). So basically what everyone's saying here is, play Eve, have fun, and if you're a decent dude, are active, kind, and passionate about the game, no doubt you'll go somewhere, but that stuff just sorta happens over time, there's no direct path to fame or success in Eve. There's also no guarantee that you won't burn out in the month, or a year, or three. Experienced Eve players know this, and many have burned out, some return, eventually all don't, it happens. But yeah, all in all, just take it easy, learn, HAVE FUN, and it'll come to you if you work for it.
---
Anyway, I could be 100% incorrect in all of these assumptions, but sorta how I read it. Hope the best to you man, it's going to require a lot of your time and effort, good luck and fly safe!
---
It would free us all, at last.
---
"solo" pvp and small gang needs just as many alts as any other activity, pocket links, ceptor alts, etc.
---
The horror, you might have to not just blob everything with 100+ titans any more! \*Gasp\*
---
We're a non-profit, something about capital expenditures and hardware replacement cycles, and if we resold them it would go to a general slush fund that doesn't benefit my department in any way. I never question it, just take as needed.
---
&gt;welp a few HAC fleets
---
This is a big one. Anything Tech 2 has a much more complicated production-chain, and most alliances don't have the industry to replace 200 HACs repeatedly. Some can re-supply through a high-sec market like Jita or Amarr, but those can be sold-out quickly and prices can spike.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
For example, null-blocs can't really use the new Triglavian ships, since the supply isn't strong enough to get a full fleet of them.
---
Right on. Horrendously wasteful, but pretty cool perk for you I guess.
---
Nullsec:Pandemic Horde and Brave Newbies. 
---
Pandemic Horde is currently at war so if you want war join us, but Brave has plenty going on too and they don’t have giant I hub fights that take forever. 
---
WH space:Pos Party and Signal Cartel. Signal is a bit different than pretty much everyone else, but still worth looking into at least.

Lowsec:Aideron Robotics is the only good one I really know of.

You must have angered bob.

No it was the opposite, I promised them a cut. They wanted to do the work so I let them, and they failed miserably. Now in my eyes they should pay me back but I'm not gonna be a douche about it.
---
I never trusted Sharo, in fact I denied him a seed 3 times for this reason. I trusted Helo and Orin.
---
What is that even supposed to mean? Are you implying you kicked me and then realised you took out the wrong problem? I'm legitimately not understanding what this means..
---
I want a story OP, cough it up.
---
Who says goon supers ever go back?
---
I still don't understand what this "not being on fleets" accusation is about, I gave you legit battle reports and showed you WHERE I WAS on these reports. I didn't miss fleets, what I had was a solo habbit lol
---
So, back in 2008 or something when I was still mostly actively playing the game but just happened to take a break at a bad time, the alliance I was in managed to lose all its core systems. Most people evacuated their stuff via cyno ships, but as I wasn't there to do that... doh! It was at least a few billion worth of stuff at that day's values. Not huuuge for hardcore players, but it was still a sizeable chunk of my assets. Not to mention many PVP ships I was fond of. I managed to get my Deimos out with a full cargo hold due to the jump clone being placed there so I could pick one ship, but that was it.  
---
Since then, every time I've come back from a break I've been bummed about the stuff being stuck there, thinking of how I might some day get it back. Well, this time I came back from a long break to notice that somehow I had assets in a system I hadn't even heard of. Then I realized it was my stuck assets in that low-sec (0.1) system. Googled things and found out about Asset Safety. Oh boy! I can finally get that stuff back!  
---
Now, it IS 0.1, so it might not be easy considering the amount of stuff, but at least it's doable. My Eris that was my first PVP Interdictor, my Sabre in which I got my first solo PVP kill, Eos, Astarte, Ishtar... ALL the ships! Some of them got repackaged as I tried to make a hauling contract for them at some point, but they're still my little babies!
---
Under $600.
---
Also, I doubt his claim on the grounds of I/O demands. One old+used (cheap) SSD probably won't serve 30 instances of gaming VDI.
---
I still don't understand this accusation, it's not true. I hate to sound like "I DID NOT HIT HER IT'S BULLSHIT" but fr, I wouldn't have so many kill mails from it if I didn't.
---
Yes this was a rule the established for me, and reluctantly I agreed. I did really have a habbit of going to lowsec to the point where they legit told me "you are allowed one death per day". I think it's kind of retarded to limit the amount your members are allowed to DIE in certain sectors of space...
---
More like California and Texas, if you want to make that point tbh.
---
Please dont pretend that INIT didnt buy fountain.
---
Sorry, it's up in all its boringness now, should've written it beforehand.
---
Um yeah i could, in fact. There were some t2 t3 ships i had to train but you gotta understand i was a 15m SP character, i can't just materialize time.
---
I'm gonna agree with sharo here, the only point to a pulsar hole in this current meta is for ratting. In reality you just want to spam leshaks....
---
Disclaimer: I support heavy bombers. I don't support aoe anti-capital bombs. Agree that's too op, particularly because the grid mobility differences between capitals and battleships. So I support focused damage bombs instead.
---
But tell me one thing. If 10 years ago a 40-man bomber fleet's ability to obliterate a 200 man faction battleship fleet wasn't a problem, why would it be a problem if a 40-man heavy bomber fleet could obliterate a 200-man carrier fleet? The price proportions of a bomber to a battleship can be the same with a heavy bomber to a carrier. Is it simply because carriers are more expensive than battleships? But it sure as hell takes less time for most people who blob with carriers to get one today, compared to the time it took for people to get a faction battleship back then.
---
In these days of Rorquals and capital proliferation you can't really justify capital privileges with "price" anymore. Hundreds of billions ain't much these days. And the game needs to adjust to that reality to keep non-capital playstyles interesting and viable.
---
Tbh all I see is you being salt lake city and the rote dude laughing
---
This person does not know what "screening" is in a military context. Or what a Defender Launcher is.        
---
In the real world large, expensive warships need to be screened by lighter, cheaper ships to protect them against weapons that are designed to destroy large expensive warships. EVE already has that mechanic in the form of Defender Launchers, there just needs to be a better incentive to use them.       
---
FCs should be forced to take out balanced and mixed doctrines for counterplay instead of being able to deathstack a single type or class of ship.

Oh yeah the quad boxxing gas huffer. He was a nice guy but had some hardcore spodbrain

---
And now y’all see the point of asset safety.  To be less penalizing to returning players.  
---
The problem people have with safety is that everyone’s shit inside a citadel doesn’t blow up when the structure dies and enters into an immersion breaking mechanic and magically reappears elsewhere.  So I have zero concern over this structure dying.  I won’t defend it.  Zero concern.  I didn’t place the structure.  There’s 1,000 of them just like it.  Zero.  Concern.  
---
The way you fix this, is to instead only offer safety to accounts, not just character, that’s are non-omega when the station dies and have no logins 3 preceding months of the stations demise as well as the successive 6(?) months.
---
Meaning if I walk away today unexpectedly, and return 9 months from now I get this option.  I thought I’d be right back.  I wasn’t.  3 months after I last logged in, our space was flipped and that station was destroyed.  6 months after the structure death, I come back because ccp bribes me with SP, I’m offered all my shit back at a place I can realistically get to.  
---
Players who don’t get the option are active subs who login and play and are using asset safety to avoid content.
---
The point of being in a corp is that you do things with your corpmates. If you prefer to spend more time away from where your corp operates where you can't help respond then you're perhaps better suited finding a corp that better caters to what you want to do.       
---
I've fallen afoul of this myself in the past. If you prefer flying in FW low then perhaps you should just join a FW corp. Otherwise it seems to your allies like you're just trying to get all the benefits of their space without sharing the burden of maintaining and defending it. So it's entirely understandable why Beans were disgruntled.        
---
Occasionally taking time off to dick around in k-space is one thing, and nobody should be kicked for that. Spending more time in k-space than out and being unable to form for defensive ops because of that is another.
---
Exploring wormholes is a great start for most career paths, and it's pretty engaging. The reward is high, especially as a newbie. And while the risk of getting blown up is also relatively high, the amount you wager is very low. One exploration / gas trip can pay for &gt;10 exploration / gas frigates, so on average you come out way ahead. You also learn the kind of situational awareness that's critical to surviving PVP (i.e., people who want to spend time with you). And you end up with hordes of materials that you need for newbie production: skill books, datacubes, salvage, sometimes blueprints.
---
So yeah, set up your production how you like... but then jump in a wormhole, preferably one in a system well off the beaten path (i.e., high sec but nobody in local). Then D-scan (press v) constantly and warp off if you see probes that aren't yours.
---
His mother must have dropped him on his head.
---
Rewarding people for not playing the game while punishing people for staying subbed is a whole new level of derangedness. I expect CCP to implement this with the next patch.
---
Or instead of making more stealth bombers, why not just make it so bombs have 100% damage resistance to their own damage type? then it becomes xx supers/titans &lt; 300 bombers
---
Having some motivation, other than avoiding bumps and AOE doomstays, to have multiple in-cynos for a biggish cap fleet wouldn't be the worst side effect.
---
Whatever

You gave your own comment gold? Jesus Christ. 😂

skillu has 1000 members and i dont think panfam and winterco are allied im not in a blob alliance but as far as i know winter co never helped panfam on any timers. why is it so hard for you to accept that you are part of the biggest blob ever assembled in this game?
---
hi, im stuffs, you mightve heard of me in corp conversations, im the one who Coup'd Helo's and Sharo's out corp out of existence..
---
dont regret doing what you did, live up to it, year or two down the line you'll be laughing about it with other scumbags from around new eden
---
Who?
---
There are ways to nerf big groups, and cause more internal conflict. 
---
Making the roles more general ( read: make people more able to screw over their own corp ). 
---
More AoE tools, stuff that will impact a big ball of ships especially capital ships. 
---
Make it easier for smaller groups to walk away with some degree of kills, as it makes fighting and losing outnumbered more rewarding. 
---
etc etc.
---
I had not heard of you, but I'm always a sucker for good stories.
---
&gt;as far as i know winter co never helped panfam on any timers
---
Then you don't know much, They showed up in tribute for the SH1 ihub defense supporting panfam just like test showed up supporting us. And NC. has shown up to help winter co with their timers in the south. If you're going to count test you have to count winter.
---
we need it back
---
is that even possible? asking for a friend...
---
I must say I was surprised about this. I actually never expected to be able to extract the assets unless I struck some deal with the current owners, even then probably getting screwed in the process (hence trying the contract thing without luck). This kind of "failsafe" does seem to go against the "hardcore EVE spirit" in a sense. Personally trying to get at least a bit back into the game again now it was a nice surprise, though. I fully expect to lose some of the ships trying to get them to high-sec, but certainly better than nothing.  
---
For the mechanism itself, it does kind make sense even with what I said above since for 0.0'er being inactive for a while sure could wind up expensive. I mean I suppose it wasn't that much different before, unaccessible assets in a hostile station could've almost as well been destroyed for all the good they were doing, unless you managed to get there to sell them via market or something.
---
haha I remember that - it was absolutely halarious... I started undocking smartbombing battleships that was succesful at first - MJDing us to your own deaths - but ya'll caught on quick and that became irrelevant
---
Because dying to a 12 second bombing run is trash game play tbh.
---
Let's make all sub cap and cap fights end in 12 seconds with a bombing run. BCs and BSs fleets? Just bomb them. Capitals? Just bomb them.
---
We'll have a nice meta of instantly ending fights in secinds with one or two half decent bombing runs by either party in a fight and it just ends up as a shitty war of attrition because capitals are deleted as often as TEST used to feed Maelstroms.
---
Plus sharo sounds gay is this true??
---
iirc we advocated for certain ships / pods to not have fatigue and frowned on the idea of entire fleets being able to relocate themselves with no penalty
---
iirc we also were SUPER LOUD about the acceptable m3 amount through said gates b/c it was going to be like 5,000,000 which you could refit supers to go through and got it pushed to 1,000,000m3 or something
---
iirc this wasn't really a CSM thing at all either
---
Sweet, I too took a break from Eve in 2008, when I came back last year all my stuff was in a null citidel, I don’t know how as upwell structures weren’t in game in 2008.
---
I was able to asset safety it all to low, took the full 30 days, I wish I had the isk on hand to courier it out via contract, but I didn’t and was relearning everything.
---
Hope you have good AC unit
---
this gives panfam and friends 34k players against tapiperiums 70k i guess
---
&gt; Because dying to a 12 second bombing run is trash game play tbh.
---
This has been the argument of those who have been in the receiving end, even for the current bombs. The problem is it's extremely one-sided. Conducting a good bombing run is extremely hard. It is easily counterable even without defenders. Lots of things have to go right on the bombing side for you to die that way. And lots of things have to go wrong on your side.
---
Bombing was one of the few actually effective anti n+1 mechanics in this game before it fell out of meta. "But dying in 12 seconds" was an extremely bad argument to begin with.
---
PS: Again I am not arguing for AOE anticapital bombs so instant deletion of cap fleets isn't a thing that I argue for. I'm just exposing some badnesses in narratives of the people fail to appreciate the elaborateness of a bombing run (and potentially have never conducted one).
---
If you make it easier for anyone with any position of trust to ruin corporations from within, people like me will have a much easier time stealing corporations for profit and fun. meanwhile, alliances that depend on trust will simply shrink their circle of trust. If you force fleets to spread out and avoid concentrating in one place, we'll just send more, smaller fleets. The bottom line is that you cannot nerf a strong organizational structure, because the vast majority of it exists outside of the game.
---
So totally farming T3's could be more lucrative than running T4's, interesting.

I mean, you kinda already pointed it out:
---
&gt;Agree that's too op, particularly because the grid mobility differences between capitals and battleships
---
There's comparably not much counterplay available.  Sure, fly with a destroyer screen, but we all know defenders are far from dependable.
---
Few things in EVE are as satisfying as a well-executed bomb run, but capital design just doesn't make aoe bombs being their counter good play.
---
No it's impossible to have a second Reddit account with which to give yourself gold. As if that's hard to figure out.
---
"We think beyond the blah blah blah."
---
Clearly you're not the one doing that thinking, eh bud?
---
Yeah, I didn't really have the ISK at the time to make the reward big enough for anyone to bother. It's always been my problem - I have assets, but no liquid capital, so to speak.
---
I guess the player stations got converted into Citadels at some point? What's odd in my case is that I never even got any notification about the asset safety thing. The stuff wasn't listed in the "safety" section of my assets, just the containers were in the system they had been transported to. I don't even know at which point that has happened.

When you set up the 2FA (in gmail anyway) you get a list of "backup codes" that can be used to pull a 1-time-use login. Print them out, and keep the hardcopy in a desk/folder where you'll know where to find them. If the password hasn't already been changed, you should still be able to get into your email and disconnect the phone. 
---
Google also has some tools to help you locate your lost phone, although I've never had to use them
---
https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6160491?hl=en for example
---
It's very important to 2FA your email to your phone because
---
1) your computer can be compromised by malware without you losing access to your email (this is a common cause of email hacks; the last time I bought stuff off a hacked eve account and the guy got his accounts, he told me his email was compromised after getting malware on his computer)
---
2) your eve accounts in particular are far more likely to be targeted by russkies trying to make some vodka money, than by people who live close to you and want to steal your phone. (Phone thief will probably just pawn your iphone without trying to commit bank and credit card fraud.) 
---
3) As above, it's not just your eve account; if they get your email they can try to hit your bank/credit card/etc
---
Make sure your phone has some kind of password/lock on it too, even if they can crack it somehow it'll give you time to go home, use your backup codes to log in, report the phone as stolen and disconnect its access.
---
There's loads of other shit you can do if you're ultra paranoid, like setting your old phone as the backup 2FA phone &amp; leaving it in a safe in your house, but mostly just having 2FA + having a plan for what to do if your phone is lost (so you don't freeze up and panic when it happens) should be enough.
---
I don't care how much work it takes to go into a bombing run. I think it's fucking shit game play to have a dread bomb you've spent months building up to be instantly deleted in 12 seconds because some bombing wing FC told a handful of dudes to uncloak and launch bombs.

2:1 odds, not 7 or 10 or 100 as is often declared by panfam and friends. And besides my point wasn't so much that you miscounted the sides, but that you said " 70% percent of the *playerbase*" when in fact what you meant was 70% of the people involved in this war. The folks in highsec, lowsec and WH space may not have a part in this war but they are most certainly a part of the player base.

I bet the GSM gave him gold
---
I think we can agree to disagree here then, because solo when I say it means *solo*, and small gang when I say it means *small gang*.
---
Solo doesn't mean "small gang but only one person" and small gang doesn't mean "medium-large gang but only a handful of people" like you seem to be implying.
---
Begging for a non agression pact you say? Hmmm. Interesting.
---
I assume you are referring to OTEC. The agreement that both PL-and-pets and CFC signed when they realized it was in everyone's best interest to sit on our moons and get fat and rich because SOV warfare sucked dick and neither side had the motivation to grind thr other down? That agreement? 
---
Yes we were so afraid of big bad PL that we invaded Fountain and fucing curb-stomped Test when they were allied with PL.
---
Or how about the Holloween war when we went toe-to-toe with PL wrecking balls in fucking drone Domis? The same war that we prison raped PL and their allies' super fleet at B-R?
---
I think your memory is as broken as your undock button, because by the time OPEC came around, PL was already on the down slide and Goons didn't have to "beg" for anything.
---
Thanks.   Have been away for a year or so and it seemed to be my go to for eve market inquiry.   Wanted to know if there had been an official reason.
---
While 20 titans in that fight doesn't exactly make it a "fair" fight, I've never been one to look down on people for using the resources at their disposal to achieve victory. Bob knows I've done it plenty of times. Good on them for taking risks.
---
It'll be back in September
---
Exciting!
---
I agree.
---
I just have an issue with "we paid billions for our carriers" logic.
---
And heavy bombers/focused damage bombs are actually good proposals.
---
Hmm, almost sounds like real life politics.
---
Well, \*I\* want us to leave behind a shit-ton of hardened citadels in strategic areas so that NCPL has to grind them all if they want to reclaim the space. For added fun, they'd all be timed for the most shit-fuckingly annoying times possible. For added incentive (and fun for us), they'd all be linked to the Eye of Terror. While they're doing all that grinding, we'll spend all our time ganking ratting supers in Delve. Okay, I'm a little vague on that last part of the plan.
---
the reason null blocs can't really use triglavian ships is not because of supply, but because their weapons require spool up. in large fights it's quite common to switch targets, warp between different spots on grid, mjd etc, so you will not utilise the full potential of those ships.
---
supply is driven by demand, if there was strong demand from major blocs driving prices up, there would be more people running abyssal sites to get the bpcs
---
This is different from dropping a dread bomb on an unsuspecting titan and killing it in 12 seconds how?
---
Found one site once that had only 1 can with a single carbon and also an astero that decloaked when I was hacking and killed my heron.
---
Worst site I've ever seen.
---
Seriously, significant alpha-&gt;omega friction...
---
Because your scenario features a single lone titan. 
---
The scenario OP propose would delete entire fleets.
---
which year?  /s
---
Cost has been a bullshit reason even going back half a decade or so.  People have rightfully said "carriers are the new battleships" as far back as the Halloween War, it's just taken awhile for the attitude to take hold.  By the time people were flying relatively expensive T3 cruiser fleets, that whole idea was out the window.
---
Cmon, the guy that plays 20 minutes a week should be able to kill all y'alls capitals with his Atron.  He pays 15 dollars a month too and is entitled to the content he wants!
---
Welcome to politics. It happened on this CSM's watch, this CSM gets the credit.
---
200 iq play right there
---
I assume this is the same nid he gated from where ever while streaming it last week and tried to shame NC/PL for not doing anything to try kill it
---
Who the hell cares? Capitals are cheaper than a decently fit t3 these days.
---
PH/TEST/Goons all are probably better than Brave currently.
---
If your so keen for NCPL to kill your shit why not try gating into a panfam staging system and see how long you last ?
---
I use Lutris to run it.  [https://lutris.net/games/eve-online/](https://lutris.net/games/eve-online/) 
---
Lutris is a front-end for wine that allows very easy tweaking of apps. Works great.
---
You can try. I found this: https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/9ywufx/t3_abyssal_sites_can_now_be_completed_in_30m_isk/
---
The key here is to find the filament that best fit the ship you're using. So I'm now running T3s Firestorm with an Ishtar. So my Ishtar is armor tank, that matches the +50% armor resistance provided by the filament, and I fire faction missiles that do thermal damage, which matches with the -50% thermal resistance (every bonus and penalty applies also the NPCs). I do them easily, or in cases not that easily but in a controlled chaos. Then you can chose a cheap ship and lose a couple now and then, or you can invest in a good fit and lose none. This is your choice. Some people run T5s with a 7 billion Gila. As I said, just  start by running T1s and you will see.
---
Because I'm actually in favor of heavy bombers and focused damage bombs. And you keep using price as justification so that's an argument against my own position too. That's why I responded.
---
If you are fine with heavy bombers/focused damage bombs then we're gucci.
---
I pay for my alts through VNIs because I just run them while I pvp on my main, which is pretty solid. The time investment for plexing 1 alt versus 3 is exactly the same.

You were until the very end. There you went all subjective. The party was great for a while after the drop too. It was eventually ruined by the lack of things to shoot at =\]

Big oof

I am surprised at how unprepared the North was for this. I mean, for the love of fuck, we told you what we would do after World War Bee. It was even on The Scope: [https://youtu.be/1nuQvuZ5-rg?t=68](https://youtu.be/1nuQvuZ5-rg?t=68)
---
Before you leave the game, however, you must assign an asset safety window.  When you come back, you must first log in during that window +/- 1 hour, or your assets enter a reinforced status and you have to wait another 90 days for the next asset safety window.
---
Hahahaha rektd
---
Oh, trust me they have a YUUGGGE hate boner for iron
---
There not forced into blobs, lazy FCs using single cynos force them into blobs, theres nothing stopping them from lighting multiple cynos and encircling an opponent.
---
It's a strong independent alliance that doesn't need no man
---
I'm so tired of this retarded fucking argument. Hold on boys don't join fleet we've reached the maximum 10% force multiplier advantage over our enemies. No log off your alts I SAID LOG OFF. THIS IS A FAIR GAME GODDAMNIT" -joecuster glorious fc
---
NVM that SF explicitly said they're here to kill us, to ruin our game however they can, they don't care if they lose the is war they're going to use every tactic they can turn hurt us 
---
Oh no this pants-on-head retarded space Bushido nonsense that is only ever uttered by fucktards that their state doesn't legally allowed to drive takes precedence
---
Well... the timeline disagrees. It shows that by the time the first titan appears on a dread-kill SNUFF (&amp;co) had lost 6 dreads, with Iton (&amp;co) losing 14. After the titans were dropped SNUFF had lost 16 more dreads.
---
&gt;Clearly you're not the one doing that thinking, eh bud?
---
a mistake regrettably made by many
---
Wow what a fucking snappy comeback. Really got me good.
---
nope, gave myself gold
---
You can but it takes 3 filaments.
---
M8 hes talking about bombers vs subcaps, not titans
---
The fit for the retribution is called notgila. I’m on mobile or I’d link it. It’s easy to do t3s in every time. T4/T5 is possible but inconsistent.
---
Because if you drop 60 fax alts as well you arent going to lose anyships
---
But FC, it's my wife supporting me by running VNIs 23x7.
---
Yes it is.
---
Yes, it is.
---
You should rename your comic from My Frozen Corpse to Hull Breach Noises.
---
that's true. every single word of it. depending on the corp, they may also ask for results of a rectal exam
---
Maybe you could just pay Red Frog to do the moving for you.
---
And glad to have you back with us, hope you make those ships explode as they deserve.
---
Doubt their doctors could get past the average goons veritable wall of hemorrhoids.
---
Can't have one, without the other...
---
Don't give them ideas please.
---
Triglavian ships are popular in wormhole brawls now though right? It seems perfect for them but I haven't played in a 1 and a half years so I've never seen it for myself
---
That's a weirdly complicated way to try and fix it.
---
Why not just make it so that assets safety activate after one month of not login into the account? As simple as that.
---
i'm talking fights with multiple fleets 1000+ ppl etc.
---
Basic opsec 101. Duh.
---
Loads of people foresaw structure spam.
---
Loads of people foresaw most of these issues
---
When I joined goons they had me send a DNA sample to 23andme.   It was only after I was confirmed to be related to a serial killer that they accepted my application on a provisional basis.   Once a month I have to go to a diagnostic lab for a blood draw.  If my blood alcohol content is ever found to be less than 0.15 then I have to sit in a rorq for a couple days.
---
Cyno inhibs, triglavian ships, support ships and a solid team is what you need to fight caps.
---
The ammo is fairly expensive as far as ammo goes, so the BPCs shouldn't be counted as worthless.
---
Also for Tier 1 that isn't too bad, since it's for newer/less-experienced players looking to dip their toe in and try it.
---
100% true.  Bodily fluid samples too (yes even that one).
---
I just traveled to the station. The adjacent low-sec system seemed clear enough, but the station system does have pirates in-system. I suppose with a pile of warp core stabs it should be doable to fly out reasonably safely at least for the more agile ships. I'd rather blow them up doing FW or something rather than getting banked by pirates :D It's been almost 6 years since my last PVP now. Time flies even if my spaceships haven't!
---
Nobody will ever beat Iron Armada using Axios to scan network traffic to see what VOIP's you're connected to, tbh.
---
Didn't want those stem cells anyway
---
When they did mine they actually told me I should run a defrag to clean up my hard drive, goons are good ppl
---
Wow
---
God Damn, you overloaded irony on that post
---
Sure, they are pretty obvious, but there is some serious bullshit going on suggesting that Goons (or goon CSM members) pushed it.
---
Its usually hams or arty or logi, ac and hm are very rare not usually very good
---
Asset safety was unironically the greatest unintentional buff to nullsec roaming of recent times.
---
For a ham loki? It depends what you want it to do
---
Goons found all my porn and now wont let me leave please advise
---
If you use and benefit greatly from something people are gonna assume you wanted it.
---
You could still sell the parts on eBay and get an omega account
---
exactly, if you don't vote you lose the right to bitch about the results.
---
Cause all I’d have to do is win eve for a month.  Let someone else clean up the mess.  I walk in and scoot off just fine.  
---
The people who have a problem with asset safety come from a place that it prevents or disincentiveizes content.  No one fights over the 10,000,000th structure if everything just poops over.  
---
Assets safety is meant to backstop people wanting to come back to eve after a break but don’t want to lose their shit.
---
People also assumed the earth was flat, and boiling cum and horse dung for a while produced a tiny soulless man.
---
LOL, if you ever get hacked... it's not your GF pushing you off the game, blame it on GSF. GF has plausible deniability once you let them in your back door.
---
You lost her, but gained farm.
---
Fucking lol
---
God damn what happened haha, back when I played it was only 500mil for a plex?!
---
I assume the behind is just a pair of assless chaps
---
the big problem is wormhole whaling. When 400 people come through you cant afford to just fold instantly all the things you had out. 
---
Its in my opinion one of the biggest things choking the meta atm.
---
That's disengenious bullshite.
---
This isn't close ot any of those things.
---
You don't just benefit, you abuse the shit out of them.
---
Level 4 site, you find the core, it's red. You're excited. You manage to successfully hack that can. You open it ... and are greeted with that.
---
I owned a personal tech moon during that time. I was in Coven our corp had more Tech moons than the rest of eve combined and I can personally attest to the fact OPEC was a myth you were fed so given that you believe this I am not surprised you didn't know about the deal. And 09 was the peak of PL no one could touch us.The reason I left was this deal among a few other things.
---
Toonswarm bukkaked me and shoved my underwear up my ass, they said it was for opsec and I trusted them,
---
Accurate we will also require DNA, and a piss test, as well as fingerprint scan your passport and financial information
---
I don't care about the cost. Burst damage in general is trash and a no fun mechanic.
---
yeah
---
Its exactly the same, because it associates two things you want to be associated, with no evidence (infact with direct counter evidence) by virtue of them being convenient for your line of thought.
---
Ask yourself why the hell wouldn't we do whatever mechanically made the most sense? Only fundamentally broken organizations refuse to change with the meta.
---
Back when I joined goons... well FUCK! I don't remember anything... I need more spod!
---
Say it louder for the people in the back
---
 Back when I joined goons... well FUCK! I don't remember anything... I need more spod!
---
Probably not through actual attrition so much as lack of production capability in the first place. If I recall from last year's war, one of the main reason NC/PH lost was because they lacked the supply chain to build enough caps to fight on even footing with Goons. There was a huge buyout of ore (and minerals, but that was after the fact when there wasnt ore to begin with if I recall) and it still just wasn't enough.
---
Lmao what they will do is make goons decide that they need to glass more, although it's pretty amusing how fast all those keepstars suddenly didn't belong to panfam anymore lol.
---
I'd love to see it when you're off mobile if ya get a chance .. do ya need AF V skill to do it? Still haven't gotten around to training that haha
---
That was after he paid the 5 billion ISK recruitment fee.
---
Don't worry, you are missing plenty of logic already
---
I'm sorry, I can't comment on what goons may or may not require after the NDA they made us sign.
---
If you actually gave any thought to the bigger picture you would see that Goons just want to be number one and the second anyone gets close enough to even think about contesting it theres a new war that spins up.
---
They did it to GOTG (lol why) and now NCPL. Test is probably next on the chopping block (if they don't get rid of Frat in enough time).
---
Goon leadership doesn't want a fight. They want to sit in their ivory towers and watch the line members and FCs grind away at their enemies while they don't even log on.
---
If thats not member abuse I don't know what is.
---
My source for this is a deployment meeting for the squads and SIGs where the Mittani said these things; discussing strategic threats and a plan of making enemies form to blueball them and fatigue them denying everyone content but insuring that no one could ever contest the economic superiority of The Imperium.
---
How many times you know your shit is gonna get blown up a month in advance?
---
Goons cleaning up the North is the exception, not the rule.
---
And by the way, you must be a wonderful borther in arms with that mentality...
---
&gt; r/eve: we hate POS, bring on upwell
---
No, never asked for that shit, always considered Citadels and their mechanics a stupid idea .
---
Cute issue dodging.
---
Do you want bots? Because that's how you get bots.
---
Honestly, you're so completely and utterly wrong it's not even funny.
---
Better suggestion: Increase blops jump range massively possibly 2x, give them a full 90% fatigue reduction, increase fatigue cap again (1-2hr red timer max, not as horrible as before, not as easy as it is now), make ansiblex gates give fatigue normally the same way jbs used to. Buff the resists on inhibs, give normal cynos a mass limit controlled by LO used, make citadels easier to kill astras and raitarus especially. Combine this with drastic nerfs or a fundamental change in anom spawn rates/mechanics that force large empires to expand and overextend themselves.
---
Make eve more dangerous, content will follow.
---
Probably quite awhile considering y'all are afraid of undocking.
---
You seem agitated. So much so that you seemed to miss the part where I agreed with you.
---
But yeah, we're not too concerned with the "isk war." We have the resources, might as well spend them doing something worthwhile and interesting. And there's no better way to get real fights than to go kick down someone's sandcastle.

---
Related to a serial killer? hmm, doesnt sound accurate. More like goons checked that you descend from 18 generations of farmers
---
The reason Goonswarm gets so much flak despite having valid points is that Goons have the temperament of a bull and constantly have a chip on their shoulder. Need to work on your hearts and minds, dudes.
---
&gt; 06:00-12:00 - AUTZ
---
During our winter about 90% of Australia's population is either on Sydney time or within 30 min of it, and 0600-1200 is 1600-2200 our local. 
---
I'd say it's much more accurate to consider our timezone to be 0800-1500. 
---
During our summer we have the opposite daylight savings to most of the world (and the fifteen percent of us in QLD fall out of sync a bit).
---
Put your 2FA things on your PC *and* your phone may works, but usually you can restore your account without calling the support (on EVE you can’t lel one of my account is blocked because of this)
---
What filament type are you running? I thought T3’s averaged 15 m/site before filament costs
---
Yea this is no joke. Since I was in PL for so long I had to write a 6 page paper explaining why I wanted to join the goons, and why I am choosing widot and not karmafleet. Also I had to use single spacing, 10 font size, and voice record myself reading the paper just in case someone found my voice annoying.
---
&gt;you would see that Goons just want to be number one 
---
Who in the fuck doesn't?
---
&gt;They did it to GOTG (lol why) and now NCPL. 
---
NC has been a forever enemy, GOTG supplied their subcap forces. Break the subcap forces, you break NCs capability to do fuck all. Horde can't cover the void that GOTG filled and NCPL helped by trying to take Branch from them so now GOTG doesn't see them as someone to assist.
---
&gt;They want to sit in their ivory towers and watch the line members and FCs grind...
---
All the goon leadership are LITERALLY the dudes on every day and grinding w/ exception to like aryth and mittani who are doing other things on other fronts so the argument point is mute.
---
&gt;If thats not member abuse I don't know what is.
---
Have you flown through Delve? Yeah - this narrative isn't going to go very far lmfao.
---
&gt;My source for this is a deployment meeting for the squads and SIGs where the Mittani said these things
---
You must not have take part of meetings with any real importance.
---
Jump clone usage incurs a cooldown for 19-24hrs depending on skills. Normally you cannot jump again so you are stuck in that clone. Which can be bad if you're in a training clone since you have implants that cost a lot of isk in those normally. Using the citadel method allows you to circumvent the cooldown by allowing you to switch if you are in the same citadel as a clone. 
---
Example. You are in jita. You jump to a citadel in null where your training clone resides so you don't need to fly out 15+ jumps. But you don't want to fly and risk your good clone so you install a second clone in that citadel. Then you activate your jump clone again (normally not allowed due to cooldown) but now you switch bodies in the same citadel to your empty clone and can go enjoy whatever it is you do in null.
---
At the end of the day before you log off you dock up and want to switch back to your training clone so you can get the benefit of your implants again while your logged off.
---
Where a medical clone comes in is when you die. If you set it to a station near jita you can death jump back to jita by flying out of the citadel in a pod and right clicking your pod and selecting self destruct.(make sure you don't kill your training clone) You will then wake up wherever your medical clone is set (you can set this in any station or citadel with cloning facilities)
---
The negative here is if you die while playing in null after using a jump clone you have to fly back out as your timer would be on and it won't allow you to use it.
---
That's just a story anti-goons lovers used to dissuade pilots from joining.

If you are breaking and collecting all the excavators 15 mil in materials is a bad run. I also speed run them with completion times being between 10-13 minutes to finish the site and wait for the cool down to finish. I was also not speaking about profit simply how much revenue from materials I make in an hour depending on if I get 4.5 or 5.5 done.

Beyond it acting as a deterrent to the behaviour they don't want, why have an unenforceable rule?

Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Eve) if you have any questions or concerns.*
---
Yeah, you use the tools the game gives you.  Even if it's dumb.  
---
That doesn't mean we'd object to changing the rules in sensible ways, it just means we refuse to be the victims of dumb mechanics.  In fact, the more goons show off how dumb something is, the sooner it tends to get fixed.
---
Why?
---
In  Dark Ochre WI. trust.
---
The rule isn't really targeted at people who want to use 2 alphas. I doubt CCP cares about them. It is targeted at those using dozens or more.
---
Well, of course you would need to tune stuff. 
---
I imagine a Battleship that has a module, which, when activated, polarizes the ship (or even lowers hp), becomes unwarpable, quite fast and low sig. (basically, a glass frigate but more expensive;) )
---
The damage becomes insane but only applicable to very large sigs (maybe make the dmg in relation to weight?)
---
You can make the weapon forbidden to activate in highsec, then you would have gankers out of the way. (like carrying this module in highsec makes you concordable)
---
In the end, this ship, as OP it would become against caps, it would need to die really fast to countering subs. So subs become more relevant again in the high-end "rock-paper-scissor"
---
I honestly think this is not true. before it was just not possible to catch up as a new player. injectors allow you, again to fly more expensive ships faster, but honestly, is that giving you an edge over a longer player? No, it doesn't
---
Didn't think the Radeon supported IO-SRV. From memory you need a Quadro or Radeon Pro.
---
Do you have different ammo loaded in them?
---
His server died and he kept posting updates about getting a new one but it always got pushed back until it just didn't happen.
---
this game is called Eve, where caps win... Panfam hat super superiority against TEST until a year ago. Also, the structure of panfam and southern alliances are different. Panfam only wants actual pvp characters in their alliances, and the rest out of alliance. While the southern alliances keep their non-pvp alts in alliance. (And maybe you haven't realized this, but it's an open secret that panfam has rorq alts in goons)
---
You can at least half the numbers of the southern alliances to get a more accurate comparison.
---
Haha, that's one way to put it!

   All I can say is lol^2, sounds like he has a career in creative writing and /r/nosleep ahead of him :)

That pod tho. Ouch.
---
If you could tell SF to kick down something other then low powered structures that'd be great.
---
For example with my skills a hawk has 59km with faction lights , 44km with fury and 29 with precision , from your ranges I would expect u to have 2 with faction and 1 with fury loaded

i was there. it was amazing, and if a certain company wanted to increase subs to an extreme level. They would take each thing this glorious OP posted (fuckSomberblinktho) , and all the whales would come to the yard, and they be like swipin that card.
---
They would be Highlanders then.
---
yea i mean you must have been on the receiving end of that bc that shit was fucking awesome lool.

So if you had two computers you could have a main Omega and a scout alpha at the same time 🤔

Is the Pikachu maymay still a thing?

ccp announce change ---&gt; goons announce how they think it's terrible for the game and how they already know how they can benefit from it. -----&gt; Goons: "told you so"

CCP please.....topless males and sparkly gold hot pants pls. I want to role play as a Exotic Dancer, Male.
---
you *don't miss* getting dunked. FTFY
---
No, there is no subscription fee for an alpha. Subtle difference, but an important one. 
---
(And if you really argued that, ccp could just activate the 'we don't like your face' clause to ban you. So you don't win)

they still didnt fight. Even if PL was using subs, lol.
---
Moving 5 regions in less than 5 minutes was awesome.
---
No idea if they're still doing it or not. Last year around this time they rolled out a required platform based on [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) that they required you to run in tandem with their auth. This monitored the ts3 servers you were connected to and was used as an excuse to also moderate permissions via ts3 because "Alliance Auth couldn't handle this" despite the fact that this is a core function of Alliance Auth, which a cursory check shows they're still using. If I recall correctly (and I might be misremembering) it was used as a man-in-the-middle verification where ts3 passed the identity + token to Axios, and Axios validated it via Auth. No idea if they're still using the Axios-based client or not, and no idea if it's been modified further, but at the time it gave me a good laugh.

&gt; putting purple on you ship doesnt give give you invincibility or triple damage.
---
That gives you more than putting similar grey stuff. It is done through ISK which are practically obtainable via PLEX. Thus, you can affect gameplay through RL money -&gt; p2w, at least the way I define "p2w". Granted, there is a not of much more impactful things you can do in EVE which aren't related to ISK, that's true.
---
Perhaps, I can see that someone who puts some thought into this game understanding that even if you want advantages through wealth, there are more efficient solutions than credit card warrioring.

with all the leetist orgs it was easy before, answer some questions, and qa`s, get shit on, ridiculed and so fort on their personal forums so they could get their high and ur in after a week or two, depending on how low esteemed they where at the moment.. goons on the other hand, cv, bacground checks and so on, done within 2 mins due to esi and good techs... u tell me hwo is the lesser of two evils?

Also being able to vni rat while doing other stuff on the new main might be good.

Personally I'd make a second account so both could log in at the same time if needed once you are in a place where you can omega both easily.
---
Spend the next 30 days doing the tutorial and beginner missions for a nest egg of ships and experience in the things eve has to offer, finish the SoE epic arc and then join any number of null sec public channels and lurk a bit. See how they treat and teach new players and if something clicks put in an app.

Be prepared to relearn an entirely different game once you make the move, Corp life is more engaging but you won't do much of the same stuff all the time.

It's like you had to use scouts, and pay attention when pos bashing instead of fwapping to pr0n. weird.

Because Amarr didn't look after their ships and fits well enough? :P

these are the tears that fill my soul. thx mate.

If you're using Ubuntu then you can just right-click -&gt; extract here a zipped file through the file manager. You don't need to do it through bthe terminal.
---
Making new folders works much the same way also.
---
Stick with it, you'll get used to it pretty quickly. It's just that you're replacing your low level experience you've accumulated using Windows. I made the switch less than a year ago and tbh most days I don't even think of it as "using Linux". Now I just use my PC.
---
I have 77b liquid and i feel poor. If i had to replace a super or my rorqs id really feel it. Fine for subcap gameplay, but teetering on the edge for cap escalations.

this thread is the most giving thread I have feasted my eyes upon in years. God Bless the OP.

Questions have to be asked of the caracal pilots. If you can fly a caracal you can fly a griffin.
---
Don't want to spoil you but all groups that you mentioned died due to their gameplay not fitting current game mechanics/new eden

OOF
---
Well tbh for me WH travel is too predictable. You can know how many ships you can move by WH.

Adding like +- 30% variable to mass will make this mechanic better.

---
I understand what you're saying. Everyone has to start somewhere. Don't be disheartened about it though. 
---
Perhaps folks the advice of other posters in this thread and try running it via Steam or Lutris?
---
Yes, so the assumption is to make those space unappealing to big groups.
---
I mean if you were that keen for NC or PL to kill it you could have just mosied over to SH1 rather than the equivalent of barking at them from inside the house.
---
holy shit haha
---
man its like you have been dreaming to post this for years to grath, and the fucking hilarious fact is he does not even  play anymore. lmfao. As always PGL, thanks for all the rock salt tears.
---
That's a BR that I like to see.
---
True ... but why?     
---
Like eve is already more work than a game.
---
how does that change anything?
---
Am i the only one who finds it odd that 50 Tier one sites yeld about 46 new Tier one filaments? 
---
That way you basically never run out of filaments, and rarely have to rebuy new ones, completely screwing the point that people who get these from datasites want to sell them.
---
Lol you're such an idiot.  Grath and I have had this conversation like twenty times, including in person.
---
Systems with local, sov, predictable PVE patterns and stable connections != systems **without** local, sov, unpredictable PVE and unstable connections
---
What about the Osprey pilots (only one of whom appeared in the link because of zkillboard's limitations with logi)? Should they have been flying Griffins?
---
Some pilots are known to have just been wandering around in Caracals investigating reports of individual WT's when the call came in. Others? Well, there weren't nearly as many fitted Caracals and no Griffins in corp contracts for the system after everyone showed up. So just assume that they were in Caracals because there weren't enough Griffins to go around.
---
Oh, that's right - you lit a cyno on a bait fort that almost got you kicked. My mistake!
---
That’s very easy to exploit.
---
When I was attacking POSes, I was able to enemy, which didn’t had dedicated stront guy, to wake up at like 3:00~4:00 am or 6:00~7:00am their local time.
---
I think thought WHSOC lived in a C4? Also how did they manage to fuck up that numerical superiority of caps? You guys didn't even have a FAX and they had 4 dreads and 2 FAXes and still managed to lose?

I'll just leave this here:

Well, [updates user flair], I'm glad that you like seeing it. The tackle issue was noted and discussed in comms after driving them out (along with the two logi ships which escaped).

I did the same, nice and easy...just like me

I acknowledge the oddity of me saying this as the guy who runs TEST’s spies, but man some people take this game way too seriously.
---
Were you in the csm?
---
That was almost verbatim what I told them, except obviously "formerly" was tacked onto that.
---
Rorquals are a great content provider.
---
All jokes aside, yes this is BS.
---
You seemed to miss the part where I said I expect people would change tactics to avoid losing their entire fleet. I’m not saying have an easy way to always delete entire capital fleets every time. I’m saying make sure there is risk in dropping hundreds of capitals at once.
---
I think what would actually happen is battlefields would become a lot more spread out, their would be more reason for sub cap control, there would be more chances for mistakes and yes there would be a legitimate risk for the 100 f1 titan pilots for once.
---
I have supers and titans, and believe it or not I don’t like they idea of them getting deleted off field. But I do want there to be risk when they are used.
---
Bien joué les gars :D
---
Of course. Everything on /r/Eve is 100% accurate. Our moderators see to that.
---
Amarr died with Spaceship Barbie
---
I stand corrected - I'm least familiar with this TZ, thanks for the info.

Why travel when I can see it in your post?
---
&gt; the second anyone gets close enough to even think about contesting it theres a new war that spins up. 
---
What else do you expect ? Five more years of peacetime to let someone catch up with us ?
---
Fuck that. We want to play. How ironic it is that you suggest we don't go to war because that would be bad for "content".
---
Jay keeps asking me for sperm samples. He bites sometimes!
---
Spies everywhere
---
What part of this would only be possible if the enemy dropped everything through a single cyno did you miss? I don’t want bombers that can instantly kill capitals. I want mechanics in the game that encourage more than just n+1. And that provide risk to capitals if they are just throwing them all into the field in a single cyno. The sort of numbers I was thinking would mean until you have 100 capitals within 30km of each other the bombs aren’t really worth it. Which means you can still use them, and unless people are dumb they aren’t getting deleted off field
---
1: complicated but the short message is that it's not pay to win. You can buy PLEX and turn that into isk with which you can buy basically any ingame item.
---
2: 3-8 buddies can have a lot of fun together. Not sure what you mean by premades. It doesn't matter if one person plays more than the others, because you don't level up in the way you are used to in other games.
---
3: Invite a friend is a program. https://www.eveonline.com/recruit Some streamers have public codes (check bjorn bee he's a good guy) But after you created the first account you can invite your friends. You can also invite yourself to create  more accounts. It is usual that people play eve with more than one account and I would actually advise you to create more than one relatively early.
---
Maybe some general gameplay advise: With several people you can very nicely cooperate. In PvE and PvP. For the beginning I would live in highsec close to a lowsec entry. Not to far from a trade hub but not an area which is too busy. People mentioned to live in wormholes. For a group of 3-8 people who know each other in RL this is a very good option but I think totally new players should better first learn some of the mechanics of the game before they do that dive. Do daytrippping though!
---
If one of your players plays much more he should consider to place another character in one of the common new player corporations. You learn much faster if you learn from experienced players.
---
We practice on 4G networks
---
As an alpha your most profitable options for making isk alone would be either Factional Warfare (which you will also learn to pvp) or scanning for relic / data sites (avoid hi sec)
---
I have a bridge I would like to sell you
---
I often go shopping to Tash Murkon trade hubs
---
Better stop massing your capitals then.
---
As the playerbase gets smaller markets will contract and retreat to jita for the final stand 
---
Eve is a sinking ship at the moment a lot of people have being looking into trying to offload isk to rmt websites before the end comes and the years of grinding isk is wasted
---
Eve is dieing
---
CCP making suicide ganking alpha account alts you can just delete and make new ones super easy killed high sec trading. High sec is more dangerus than 0.0 GG CCP. #makehighsecgreatagain
---
Yikes, that's salty.
---
Those arent necessary. But just for fun
---
If you can find the logs of a character in IGS  chat back around 2014, from a character by the name of Lance Buckskin, you will have a good time.
---
&gt;Eve is dieing
---
never heard that before
---
None that I'm aware of, and any you find are probably scams. Just use a freeport citadel. If you are trading PLEX in volumes that a 0.1% - 0.3% tax is a significant amount of isk, then anchor an azbel for your own private use (and be prepared to defend it).
---
Just a fact thats very easy to sell 50 bill of loot in Jita during 24 h is awsome. That shit in Amarr will take me 1 month. Plus Jita local i awsome. In Amarr there is some weard dude posting pictures of himself and station all the time
---
*will be used by anyone against anyone dumb enough to blob all capitals through a single cyno.
---
And limiting jump ranges REALLY stopped power projection and large alliance last time didnt it?
---
Anything that makes it harder for larger groups to hold will make it harder for smaller groups
---
i want a tiny ferox pet to fly around with me
---
It used to be a meme but ccps decision making in the last year and job layoffs/resignations and the botting increse all point to a company that no longer care
---
All 3 have scourge fury loaded. 
---
All 3 have Missile Bombardment @ 5.
---
Yet only Monkey3 gets 57km range, other 2 are @ 44km.
---
And thats a huge difference, somewhere I am either missing something, or my clients are broken /me sighs
---
&gt; Test is probably next on the chopping block
---
Zero chance they go to war with test.
---
&gt; It used to be a meme but ccps decision making in the last year
---
Finally a nerf to capitals and rorquals and revamping HS so a few vets can't bully new corps sure is bad decision making.
---
Check "Missile Projection" skill. Check implants.
---
true true, misread on my part
---
Well, first of all because subcaps can break dreads.       
---
Titans are sometimes dropped to bash or defend things and  lent heavy support to their fighting subcap Wings. 
---
But I'm no cap/super FC. I can just tell you what I see being done.
---
&gt; mittani who are doing other things
---
That dude is so far removed from eve i'm shocked he even remembers it's a game
---
Actually true. Missions and everything introducing to new players still needs to get better though, and lowsec still needs to be a better place.
---
That was said ten years ago. I just assumed the layoffs where CCP prettying up the bride before the sale, you think they are hurting financially?
---
Thats not true at all, NC Spai's are easy to spot, you just say 'quickly undock for me' when you get the response 'huh?' or 'how?' NC Spai confirmed
---
Heres the honest thing. The servers cannot handle a proper largescale capital fight (like without breaking things)
---
TLDR: servers cannot handle things like AOE stuff which is really the only main way to counter blob stuff
---
IF the server could handle things properly, like sure tidi could still come into effect but not to where modules would not take 30 minutes to activate after activation and reliably activate, you would be seeing a large difference in fleet fights and tactics.
---
Like you could see entities like NC. alone being able to kill the entire goon titan fleet granted with heavy risk and losses. Thing is that the game cannot handle the calculations required to be performed at the same time.
---
Example of what im talking about: Goon titan fleet on field attacking something (think keepstar brawl) NC. Has pre-setup cyno spots encompsassing the grid.
---
Now what NC. Does is cyno in titans at spread out spots fitted with barebone fit, lance and emergency damage control. Now you can see where this is going.
---
What would happen if the game could handle it: titans being cynoed in at seperate locations mitigate/remove the AOE neut from affecting each other, while lancing the hostile fleet (who are mostly bunched up due to cynoing in and  having to remain withing FAX range) Hostile fleet will then receive either enormous damage or at the very least lose their fax support leavig them essentially sitting there alone and die (while also taking the damage from all the lances) and so on and so forth
---
However because the server cannot handle it what would in turn happen is this: (same situation as above just before the cyno in bit) cynos could be light and maybe half the fleet would make it through or be stuck in black screen limbo. After that, the few that do land can either attempt to retreat due to insufficent numbers or carry on their pre-determined orders. Now for the sake of the situation they continue; once the first lance starts dealing damage half of local will most likely dc or even the server will straight up crash (same reason why CCP removed AOE titan death damage).
---
So if CCP creates something like your suggesting (heavy bombers essentially) with bombs specifically designed against capitals. It doesnt solve the issue but bring in new ones. The game is just too old and without a complete overhaul (which to be fair on CCP's end they are trying their best) of the game there just isnt any feasable way to counter a large enough blob withoit resorting to a brawling match
---
He's just an over excited reddit poster
---
Do all 3 have the same af skill level?
---
Among other things yes these decisions were awful look what the new war Dec mechanics have done every merc group in eve that have fought each other for years have teamed up into 1 single allance for even more kills and harder to fight
---
For everyone watching from home: mute the audio. It's crap.
---
Why send it to a random person when you could just send it to me? ;)
---
 To be honest, for a guy who has been around the block a few times, PL is the only group that I was apart of that consistently tried to fight out numbered. Everyone else was recruiting 5 mil sp toonies, but PL had waffles that upheld standards to join PL.  You needed an alt that was basically a Swiss army knife that could use caps. For example armor combat/triage carrier plus dread skills(or a dread alt in training), and fly a blops with JDCV.
---
 Your main needed t2 weapons systems, along with  HAC/Recon/CovOps/Inty V before you graduated. Not to mention actually grooming each pilot that had thick enough skin. The pilot could/would FC, or at the very least be willing to step up when an FC died so your waffle brethren did not diaf. Also, if  you vouched someone into PL it meant your head was on the chopping block if your vouch fucked around at all. 
---
 So really it was a well oiled, and planned out machine that put more effort into keeping fresh blood in the ranks, and  making sure to keeping the fat trimmed rather than filling up with f1 mashers to create a blob to pew. So naturally the lions, and crocs would feed on the wildebeests in horrific fashion that still creates sweet, sweet juicy tears 6 years later.
---
&gt; every merc group in eve that have fought each other for years
---
lolololol you mean turbo stombed new corps who have no chances ? What a terrible loss to the game.
---
It was a lot of fun what are you talking about????
---
They did a cavity search on me to make sure i was homosexual while i was transporting pollen.
---
Yeah I was confused. He keeps saying ‘we’ all the time.
---
You mentioned that X large are bad, so how would you do active rep, ham,  shield loki. 
---
Reason I am asking is that I just got the sp, to fly them, and am researching fits. Any insight into good fits helps.
---
They were not lost tho they combined forces and got stronger.......
---
r/substhatifellfor
---
Who would buy stuff from Amarr? Provi barely has a population, TAPI/Goons are too deep in null to benefit from the closer market hub, and also do much of their own production locally, lowsec is dead as a doorknob in Aridia/Khanid/etc...
---
Giving CCP some information on _how_ to make a fun event might be more productive than sperging on /r/eve. 
---
Saying 'put some effort into it' is shitty feedback. 
---
You should feel bad.
---
So much YES!!!
---
I skipped that doing these two steps
---
1). proved my IQ was under 70 on several test scores while sober.
---
2). Sent photos of my liquor cabinet next to my gaming pc.
---
I got in right away and I am in training to be an FC.
---
I plex 9 accounts, my goal in eve is to be in a position where I can buy all the best stuff to at some point lose it in a glorious way, I get a lot of satisfaction from the isk acquisition aspect of eve, i find having your fingers in a lot of pies is a good way to avoid a single tedious repetitive way of making isk, follow your goal to become space rich, I'm currently playing with a guy who has gone from alpha to trillionaire in 5 months and he is not in a alliance, it's from solo activities
---
You're saying that but some people didn't understood the concept of "daily login rewards" so it was a challenging event for some people.
---
An Amazing fight, praise BoB for the content!
---
Also a nice video, always fun to see a fight from a different perspective.
---
Missions are just bad. Nobody wants to make missions compared to how easy NS combat sites are or how more interesting / worth it abyssal space is. Nobody want to warp to severals systems away.
---
Both HS and LS need proper PvE with decent reward (comparative to safety), PvE AI of abyssal space, and all of that in combat anomalies or signatures (actualy signatures would be great). And ship hull restrictions.
---
Issue is, it's pretty low on the priority list and pretty demanding development wise. But hey, one can dream.
---
Is Digi back?!
---
Who cares if they can't turbo stomp new corps it's much, much better for the health of the game. You want to put up structures in HS ? Well just like the rest of the game if you can't defend it against bigger fish you don't deserve it.
---
This really is what happens when you huff too much gas.
---
Who gives a shit if they get stronger and annoy the nullsec guys, the point was to get them away from wardecing newbro corporations in highsec.
---
you must be miss informed my kool-aid drinking neckbeard, and to use zero context too lol. I can supply that since you are inept to do so. 
---
It was an astrahaus, and one idiot jumped to a blind cyno(that I should have dropped from fleet when I jumped to it, warped to station and docked up ez pz.)because that always is a fantastic idea. 
---
What else ya got up in your vagina, dumbledore?
---
naw you are just a salty cunt.
---
i think matching the griffin numbers to thier fleet, ie: here it looks like too many griffins, and like 3 dudes in maulus instead of griffin may of been more optimal to reduce the lock times of the leshaks. that or more crucifiers to reduce the damage application from tracking damps.
---
also i enjoy looking at this BR more than anything,
---
IvL a good guys, always bring a fight with similar ships, frigs, t1 cruisers and the like, already had respect for you dudes, and i used to be Blue with Pirate, who people give alot less credit for than they deserve, theyre actually not bad guys. they honor deals, at all costs, and get good numbers for hisec, hell, better numbers than lowsec groups somtimes. nice to see here they brought the GF instead of a blob.
---
The whole Kamela - Amamake pipe is just round the corner and that's pretty well frequented for lowsec standards. Also, Amarr used to be the wormholers trade hub because it's geographically more central than Jita, dunno if that's still the case.
---
Today is mandatory penis inspection day.
---
Everyone report to Doc. Johnson for your mandatory penis inspection.
---
Ah eat a dick mr. doomheim
---
It mines the ochre or it gets the Wibala
---
so you gated around in some of the most secure regions in eve and you're surprised a coalition 1/4th your size didn't kill it?
---
Aww bless him, he is the nicest guy.
---
Lmao the Ninazu is the best triage in the game, but ok.
---
Doesn’t do anything for me.
---
/Doesn’t mean I don’t want you to have it, but I’m not going for it.
---
I think the case is less that they're hurting financially and more that they aren't putting their Pearl Abyss money to good use. They got what, $400Mn out of that? And what have they invested that in, making yet more side projects that will inevitably fail?
---
Goons have 10k kills the last 7 days, NC. have 3k. Goons are 33k dudes, NC. is 4k. Maybe you should undock more?
---
I really don't want to believe you.
---
EVE needs more content like Epic Arcs, long storylines that add to the lore of the game and are interesting to new players and veterans alike.
---
Sounds like a wild time tbh
---
Only requirement is to be gay.
---
It's still the case.
---
Keep the other one as your alt and put the time in with the new one. Get a couple of jump clones and make one a training clone with implants. You will be back up to 4.4 mill sp in less than two months.
---
Remember to use a recruitment link from your original account on your new account, it will give you a load of free starter sp
---
&lt;/3
---
Pretty normal actually
---
I know this is bollocks but this kind of fuckwittery is why i wont move out to null again. 
---
Last time i join null i had to sign up to corp discord, alliance discord, coalition slack, alliance TS , coalition Mumble, alliance forum, alliance wiki, coalition forum, alliance authentication, Coalition authentication + near2. The authentication was for 20+ characters across 5 accounts most of whom were usles research alts on accounts i couldn't even remember the passwords for. That on top of all the checks the corp made. 
---
 If that's the typical kind of bullshit you have to go through to get in to a nullblock just as a bog standard line pilot, you can keep, it I'll stay in lowsec.
---
The worst part is, they probably could have gotten better metrics by making it an actual *event* rather than just BS login rewards. Make us *work* for our pay, dammit. Give us fun new content to complete. It'll cut down on the market inflation, get people playing instead of just logging in and hitting "claim", and it's actually engaging.
---
Yeah dude I hate it when I can't sell 50 bil in 24h
---
*flies off in Tristan*
---
Search the system name and go with that? Dock when you are in system, shouldn't be using auto pilot anyway
---
i used to follow the instructions but they seem to not work for me on Ubuntu anymore. 
---
Steam and proton however works now.
---
Maybe they changed something in the launcher, i couldnt get to the bottom of it.
---
nice wifebeater
---
Which Ubuntu? I might look into this.
---
Was the crimson harvest event the last good one? I remember it being pretty much the first event they ever did...
---
Yeah, but wormholes are dead now.
---
x larges are good, larges are bad. x large boosters are usually rlml fit and either xlasb or blingy 2b+ deadspace booster. it also depends if you want cloaky or not
---
You can make like 1-2b per hour doing missions, I dont see why anyone would run anoms instead of missions
---
for jay
---
Found a CCP employee. 
---
Good try to make us do your work for you, sir.
---
But how about no.
---
&gt; But I do want there to be risk when they are used.
---
Instantly deleting assets is not an example of good "risk", especially if there is effectively zero counterplay between these cruisers appearing, launching bombs, and warping off.
---
I could suggest a mechanic that would punch in you the balls each time you undocked in a blob of capitals greater than 20 and say "I wAnT tHeRe tO Be RiSk iNvOlVeD". 
---
Like i've been saying this whole thread. Instantly deleting assets like this is a no fun mechanic that is shitty to play against.
---
&gt; And that provide risk to capitals if they are just throwing them all into the field in a single cyno.
---
Then why don't you suggest a change that impacts the Cyno, and not a change that deletes everything that jumps to it instantly? It seems like you realize there's more than one problem, but you're stuck on advocating a solution to the wrong one.
---
Have points you gain from doing event unique combat / mining / exploration sites who gives you loot unique or faction specific items. Maybe have make BPC for some boosters but NOT the training speed one which you Can build from the ore / explo loot you get.
---
Get rewards from points. Boosters, skins, that kind if shit. Make the sites not trivially easy. Don't make it stupidly hard to get the training booster but maybe do it for a skin.
---
Make the sites widly available.
---
lol, everyone was well aware of how the changes were going to effect EVE. Everyone knew that if goons weren't evicted before citadels were introduced it would be a 10 times harder grind then it ended up being. If you think goons are the only ones able to see how changes effect the game it just shows why everything actually hates goons, its because of that dumb ass ego....

Missile Projection?

As Nullsec blocs get bigger and hold a more significant part of the playerbase, highsec tradehubs become less relevant.
---
Nullsec players shop in their alliance's trade hubs. The people stocking those often produce locally. Anything that isn't built locally is imported with jump freighters. Even living in the south, the difference between getting to Amarr and getting to Jita is not significant. If Jita has better prices or better stock, the market people will import from Jita.
---
I heard you were in a titan and bridged everyone to lowsec.
---
Also Amarr has blue loot orders. It's a pretty minor thing because there's a blue loot buy order within less than 10 jumps almost anywhere, but it's a quality of life thing if you're a wormhole krab.
---
killing russians is god's work, don't use russian derivites (spell check but at least i use english words and am not a dirty russian)
---
Ouch, factual burns are like the white phosphorous of argument burns, well done lad.
---
Test is kingmaker in this scenario and currently they hate panfam a whole lot more than goons.
---
Thanks bot, but I think CCP should stay away from zkill
---
INDEED :)
---
&gt; voice record myself reading the paper just in case someone found my voice annoying.
---
Is it bad that my (small-ish, less than 100 members) corp unironically voted to reject a new recruit because the majority thought he had an annoying voice?
---
Of course, we didn't tell him that, wouldn't want anyone to feel bad about themselves.
---
Not a problem man is fun doing these videos :) and thanks.
---
People stating the Ease of Selling in Jita do not know the gains from selling it out of Jita.
---
Yeh and takes a minmatar pilot to actually fly them well ;)
---
Good alliances just have one centralized auth and you use the same account over all services.
---
Idk what kind of shit corp you signed up with lmao.
---
All 3 have it @ 4
---
Just set up a Keepstar and park the supers there, then defend the krabs with your second super
---
A mix of damps and jamms would probably been more effective.
---
refit the titans with mining lasers, deny the enemy ore!
---
Bring back attack vulnerability windows for structure shields with a minimum of 6hrs. And make ALL reinforcement timers come out randomly in a window of 3 hours before or after the chosen time of day of the defenders. Least that way everyone wins

Tryhard groups and players burn out faster than lazy carebears, more news at 11.
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
Just use an emulator
---
Maybe if they did that to female toons??this don't mean a thing to me unless we can walk in bars and well fights ccp jail for 5 mins while other runs for his ship?? I dont know will they get strippers?? Then i can see it but not sure on ccp ideas. I say ehor smeh for now meaning not sure if has a place in eve yet. 0.2 systems and lower are seedy as is so why not ?? Also bad implants to make pilots do dumb things try self distructing pods and ships unless you can dock in 300 seconds. Maybe??
---
Flair checks out
---
My own seed eh, ::thinking::
---
I think most of us would like to believe that the era of Digi doxxing is behind us.
---
Sadly Goon leadership is the same now as it was then, so it will come down to if a shift in the mindset of Mittani and co has occured.
---
IP logging for spy burning is still a thing, but I don't think it extends to RL anymore.
---
&gt; every merc group in eve that have fought each other for years have teamed up into 1 single allance for even more kills and harder to fight
---
aka "how things were before anyway"
---
Yeh I am an idiot
---
Well theres the Diff, one has 4 others only 1.
---
Injected, problem solved ty guys

I see your clever use of technology and raise you my 2010 era laptop taken out of the closet so I run all my spy shit on a different physical machine.

---
they cant demand anything or force CCP to listen all they can do is advise with logical and passionate arguments even if they fall on deaf ears
---
&gt;**Assault Frigates bonuses (per skill level):**  
---
10% bonus to Light Missile and Rocket max velocity
---
Maybe this is the case
---
So wormholes?
---
It also has manufacturing facilities if you want to make some high-margin stuff quickly.
---
Your head logistics guy was saying "letting supers through ansiblex gates is fine because they would use too much ozone".
---
Maybe the CSM pointed out to CCP how dumb the gates were, but the 'super loud' spod brain posters were all for it and denied that a super cap highway from cloudring to immensea would ever be a thing.
---
Redundant. Chaps are assless by default.
---
I like that assumption. Ospreys are great but the best type of logi is the one where they can’t hit you at all :)
---
Explore in warzones, low amount of explorers and all the pvpers are focussed on objectives and other fleets. Afaik less chances of shitty gatecamps.
---
&gt;Epic Arcs
---
Yeah, give us the rest of pirate arcs!
---
Put so much bounty on that ass
---
Full disclosure, I'm in TEST so kinda biased.
---
If you do join Dreddit, you won't be able to join Bombers Bar fleets, since they often come to Esoteria (TEST homeland) to hunt, and you don't want to be shooting your own friends.
---
Predditors are a really strong group too though, and I can absolutely endorse that. But it's often dangerous to fly around highsec if you're in a major nullsec alliance, since you'll be wardecced 24/7.
---
It was on the eve of Invasion starting, that's very eventful, I am still really happy about the SP.
---
Even though it was repeated on comms and in fleet chat every minute to *not* undock from the station, some people just don't listen. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Add rewards to the milestones on the new achievement system (I forget what it's called)? Dovetail the agency, the achievement system, industry, faction warefare, trading and what not, into one all encompassing career system, that rewards you with daft items (like in the daily log in), isk and at high levels maybe even with sp.
---
 Nah that's a silly idea simplifying the bloat of the last 15 years of features and making it rewarding...
---
No region in eve is secure :)
---
yep, really noticed it when watching some new players livestream eve
---
You've been a paper pusher longer than I've played bud
---
There would be very little reason to have that. I would say that if a major nullbloc (goons, horde, TEST, NC.) is floating hundreds of trillions, they are doing something wrong and should git gud at long-term investments.
---
Goons absolutely are gud at that, so I very much doubt they would go as high as quadrillions.
---
Do you have any evidence of that decline except for a general feeling that back in the day everything was better?
---
If I have a short glimpse at https://www.adam4eve.eu/structure_history.php?id=60008494 I cannot see a "significant decline". Do I need to look for some specific flags? If so please point me there.
---
It wasn't a event, it was a giveaway, they gave us a month of SP, all you had to do was launch to character selection, so they weren't even trying to inflate logins.
---
NC have 11 times the potential targets with less than 1/3 the kills. Maybe they should shoot straighter.
---
Honestly we just keep adding more and more plasters on to shit and just building on sand.
---
The basic concept of citadels is great. For a number of reasons
---
Asset safety allowed years of people getting screwed by their life long assets stuck in sov stations
---
No more station games and just constantly hell camping where people wouldn't undock for weeks
---
Just having your own station is cool
---
No more pissing about with POSes everything is there for you and easy to add more services. 
---
I dont think the value citadels have is actually the problem.
---
However
---
Far far too cheap how the hell can a big space station be as cheap as a decent fitted T3 ship?
---
They should be at least 10x more than they are now and I mean that.  Astras should be like 10bill a fort 100b and a Keep like 800bill
---
Also again the time to build is ridiculously quick should be 7 days.  Who can build a fully functional station in  a day?
---
These alone should stall proliferation
---
But again more needs to be done
---
TZ tanking..  stop it. What stupidity..  again if you cant defend it then should you really be having it.  Now I do believe maybe adding more defensive capability and more HP is the way to go to help little guys from getting stomped on.  But let's be seriously if a large Cap fleet is coming and you cant defend it anyway it's going to die regardless of the TZ.  What I'm saying is if people want to kill you rather that a drive by shoot then they will alarm clock.
---
The old pos mechanics on timers wasnt so bad tbh.. I do think there should be only ONE timer.  Thats it.. you have a chance dont blow it.  It stop people bothering at the first timer..so why have it.
---
Stopping supers and caps docking if fighters are out etc .. really?  Why...  the station is the safe haven if you didnt catch it before then tough  luck.. 
---
Being able to spam 100 citadels in a system is ludicrous...each system should have a max number and that should also be weighted on the size if those citadels. I mean jesus this makes it worse much worse than the days of pos bashing.. 
---
Perhaps go back to anchoring on moons only.. or even planets only.
---
Got a BR for that?
---
You make far more isk from missions compared to anoms tho
---
Perimeter though.
---
&gt; Provi barely has a population 
---
Whut? Have you even been here since Legacy bitch-slapped PL out of the region?
---
Provi is more active now than it was before the PL invasion. Fewer actual people in Provi-Bloc, but the ones that remained and have joined are actually doing shit. The ones that left were the dudes just sitting around having staring contests with Spod rocks during every combat op before and during the invasion.
---
And that's not even taking into account the other groups like RC and the various PanFam rejects that came back after PL and NC. started eating dick up north. 
---
Spectre might also be worth mentioning, at least in terms of trade. Their ships tend not to last long, so they are no doubt generating some trade in Amarr.
---
They had a similar requirement in Pizza, except they looked for Hitler's descendants.
---
Why do you assume I am auto piloting and not setting way points to highlight my target destinations on my overview?
---
Yes when you're running L4 in battleships. Not when you starting as a new bro.
---
The problem is, there are no weapons "that are designed to destroy large expensive warships" that you would need to screen against in EVE
---
um no the different merc groups competed with each other and sometiems got into conflict with each other, you know something is wrong when tora bushido leaves his own allance to join pirat
---
oof
---
dont kid yourself there are no newbro corps in highsec its all freighter alts
---
what a fucking asshole, i hope he gets mauled
---
The last event I "enjoyed" was the race. You know the one where you took shuttles into low and null to reach waypoints to get the rewards, losing a few hundred shuttles to smart-bombing gate camps on the way.
---
Jesus you guys will upvote any old shit
---
Always nice seeing highsec "pirates" btfo.
---
Damn son!
---
on the plus side: Mr Pawlow would be proud of them
---
Try feeding Geckos!
---
There should be more tools to delete capitals. The problem is finding something that can't be abused and also doesn't break subcaps at the same time.  
---
I agree with you that "bigger bomb" can't be the solution.  
---
Even if "bigger bomb" would be a lot more expensive mechanic (like loading up a jump freighter with explosives and jumping it in), it would still be too effective with the current state of the mechanics (you would basically always get nuked on your in-cyno).
---
you happen to watch rick and morty?
---
I personally think the game population is just in decline and we're seeing the impact of less people doing stuff
---
apologize to your  Christmas Turkey first
---
Downvoted and reported, this video has nothing to do here.
---
heavy focused bombs is actually something I can get behind, what do you think would be a good number of those to delete a titan?
---
How long does it usually take goons to return the results of your mammogram?
---
Why would anything happen between goons and Test?
---
christmas turkey gets a quick chop on the neck w/ a sharp blade, dead in an instant 
---
this croc got a dull old hedgetrimmer to the spine and is suffering horribly bc the idiot has no idea what he is doing (besides just killing random wild animals that did nothing to him)
---
It's something we've talked about internally for a long time and something that both myself and u/ccp_peligro have advocated for :)
---
There's a lot of gaming companies that do this, it was first kicked off by Wargaming on WoT if I remember correctly.
---
\&gt;LOL
---
Cyno inhib to stop them from being on grid in the first place?
---
is this a video of a guy breaking the back of a young crocodile? With 0 context I would like to ask the moderators to remove this please.
---
Yeah let’s get some tits in this game
---
Well, economic theory would say that if the gains from selling outside Jita were significantly higher then they'd be capitalised on. They don't seem to be, so there can't be that much of an advantage to it.
---
what risks tho
---
They are also the same people who spammed the official forums with "BEEP BEEP I'M A TRUCK" when a member of old NC was killed by a lorry. Goon leadership has really been truly awful people out of game. Hopefully a lot of this is behind them but I don't remember them ever so much as apologising for that or for doxxing and using digi.
---
Besides bombs, that is. Which are countered by screening destroyers.
---
delete this post. Nothing is related to eve
---
Sound like perfect reason to push advertisements into everyone’s faces at all times. Because there might be someone who needs this unique and nice thing or opportunity but would not know where to look at!
---
Like in yesterday’s concert of KISS while we were waiting for start we were shown with advertisements of some Toyota car.
---
fucking turbospod
---
you are pretty dumb if you think you can "catch up" with injectors. as much as it might've helped the new players, the true winners are the established players.
---
thanks to injectors you will never ever be able to "catch up"
---
so in other words you want more A2V6-6 systems?
---
&gt; sometimes
---
lol
---
Did they stop the .01 in jita? They no longer ganking on the major routes to jita? Has manufacturing move to null?
---
its disgusting and thank you for preaching this i think people forget that this 40k man group of players is getting cheesed by the ones who run it all
---
In my experience the goon attitude towards spies was that other than the small group of people at the top assume every layer was infiltrated with spies and save the trouble of bothering to try and find them.
---
Not that it makes a diffetence, since everyone is following Mittani's ineffable grand plan no one needs to know what it is anyway.
---
Pretty sure u don’t have scourge in the 1st one , because I have max skills and only 44km
---
gachiHYPER Clap
---
can we make this copypasta
---
The gains are significantly higher. Easiest billion of my life was the one time I bought a few Precursor Destroyer books in Jita a few months ago and resold them in Amarr at 3x the price. However the out-Jita volume is lower and people are lazy.
---
@kronos ritual noobs dont go to bed before posting ur video to reddit idiot
---
Got any spare injectors lying around?
---
First off, hi Redline, been a while.
---
If helping me get rich, helping me learn how to play and generally letting me do whatever I want in exchange for having fun with others is abuse, well sign me up.
---
If you didn't enjoy it that is OK.  But I have fun here.  
---
As for the rest, that is simply NC/PL's chickens coming home to roost.  More than a few Goons remember Deklien and Saranen.  More than a few Goons remember  "The Imperium is dead, the bad guys are gone."  or  "Goonswarm would never be allowed to field more than 200 people in a fleet."  
---
Goons have rebuilt themselves, and are returning the same treatment they got.
---
So for NC/PL the real question is: Where is your casino now?
---
I think that's mostly only Delve.  The other alliances still import more than 50% of their stuff, not counting capital hulls.
---
I have SO MANY QUESTIONS and the weirdest boner right now
---
Economic Theory means you are delusional and selling to anyone else for 30% better is the new economic theory.
---
Oh doxxing was completely normal in their culture. I remember when I was 401K's alliance leader, I got doxxed and my personal email was slammed with random idiot messages.
---
Luckily I was still a student at the time, not sure how much grief it could have caused if I'd already been an employed professional, etc.
---
DBRB doxxed one of our FCs who had a spy in Goons on one his streams as well, no one batted an eye.
---
The first phase should definitely be a standalone approach, so people who don't have any interest in EVE can enjoy a solid shooter. Meaningless battles (every day faction war struggles that are too small for capsuleers to be involved), Sansha battles if you like PVE, maybe fight drones for resources.  
---
Also rogue like trig battles where you try to survive and escape with as much loot as you can.  
---
Based on this you add the next phase. The faction war battles affect the actual faction war, Sansha affects actual incursions.  
---
Next stage is interaction between the games, maybe you need a vessel in EVE doing the hacking in security/drone facilities and you can launch some of the loot into space to thank the capsuleer for the help.  
---
What you should really be careful with is a shared market, because there is enough ISK in EVE to break Nova.
---
That is fair for some, but assumed for all.  You might be surprised if you ever hang out with us.
---
Pretty much every online game EULA has rule like that.
---
I actually import from Amarr to O8-n
---
As someone who has roamed provi in all tz’s and someone who lived there for 2 years it’s way less populated now than it was before
---
Capitals don't need destroyer screening vs bombs
---
Definitely isn’t. There is a scam alt corp set up. Not in the actual alliance but close enough names. They have their own fake website for apis and everything. It’s how they know what you’ve got and what their target is to scam. 
---
Could be moving your super for you, recruitment fee, security fee, no collateral “first time move in” (which legitimate corps do but with collateral)...
---
If you’re just trying to blindly defend goons then go check it out on your forums.
---
Smug/10

That is beautiful

not sure about that nyth guy but the rest is good

thank you

as a highsec merc myself no they were not always blue and as a highsec merc im telling you i have unsubscribed 10 accounts but not for the wardec changes but a collection of changes that just piled on top of each other, i was a world of warcraft player for about 4 years before i got into eve in 2008 and i seen the changes that wow made first hand that made the game more casual friendly and eve is following in its footsteps.
---
But there could be sites in that hole.
---
&gt; its highly likely that you cant get even the basic modules anymore.
---
sounds like a market seeding business opportunity right there btw
---
maybe shoot someone your own size then?

By this logic QUIET should have 100k kills

If you can't goodpost and plagarize the quality work of others, at least cite the original author.

That's what she said

I mean, full API on every account is pretty common now? Back in the day it was a case of "pahah never give up that information!"
---
Is a retarded spod brain reddit comment really worth a new thread. Delete this.
---
from what i think went on,
---
during peak galmilistan before last years great war, WANGS and FEDUP were busy making butt buddies and doing cool kids shit. Once the war kind of puttered along it got boring as fuck. So they went back from null and decided to make this huge push right onto calmils stronghold - eha.
---
galmil was all blue to eavother including rdraw (WANGS) which meant including snuff which meant calmil was getting cleveland steamered (eha sieged and they couldnt escelate much lf anything), so they left and content absolutely died so a huge portion of galmil FEDUP actually used the end of the last war great war to move further into null. the other half that was blue to snuff (WANGS) cucked roi henry and he submitted his entire corp and alliance into wangs. With the content dried up and the war over old beef turned into stank beef. the leaders of FEDUP and WANGS had hatefuck sessions during the old spaceship Bebop, an alliance long dead that was big in gallente fw. This old beef got flipped into prime beef and fedup got their shit pushed in by snuff and wangs. i dont exactly know why this happened because i won eve during this whole event but the beef was just enourmous and FEDUP got evicted from their past blues.
---
fedup went down south and joined legacy while WANGS did ghettohood shit with Snuff and GMVA just stuck to their thing in vlil and did lowsec shenanigans.
---
recently one of the founding big corps of FEDUP, Aideron Robotics, decided to pull out of the alliance and go back home. the reason why is full of drama but its all old news (or if youre in fedup you just drink enough koolaid to forget about it).
---
thats the history atleast i can grab from my perspective being in fedup for the past almost 2 years.
---
What's the problem? Get in there and grab dat loot!
---
r/woosh
---
but let me gold it first!
---
They never even bothered to go back and finish up the Minmatar or Gallente epic arcs from when they first put them in. You think they will even bother to put in an epic arc now ? Only thing they do now is more skins and whatever new shiny feature they have laying around or is the latest wild hair on Hilmar's ass.
---
Do people actually believe that PA paid 400 million dollars to CCP's bank account? Are you that stupid?
---
I would say the worst relic/data site I had was the one where three cloaky Lokis were waiting for me... ;-)
---
There was the drone event, and permafrost event.
---
During the drone event I got really good training boosters and made hundreds of millions of isk selling the lower tier ones.
---
The permafrost event brought us frostline scanner mods, I have 10 of them I got for nothing at the start, and again, made hundreds of millions.
---
Pretty cringe
---
Filthy casuals playing eve online *gasp*

minus 1x7

No problem

make lowsec in highsec

Oh thank god

The whole point of running Linux is to gitgud

reread the OP of the chain you are replying to and think again

i liked the part when good fight started

I have an alt that trades out of Amarr. My profits have been steadily increasing there for years. I call bullshit.

Do not worry, nobody is perfect

Hi NC, nice try

That's what she feared

12 s bombing runs are lame? ever been at the receiving end of a super's fighters bombing run? not fun either

I will just um , here you go: https://evewho.com/pilot/Backdoor+Bandit

i agree, those fighters deal waaay too much alpha.
---
made me lol, ty for this
---
HON HON HON HON HON
---
This is a very invasive change with probably more negative than positive side-effects. I don't like the fact that this proposes an offensive "solution" because offensive solutions are also subject to n+1, basically you're asking for large groups to abuse this mechanic to hell and back. How about CCP finally makes cap models as large as the actual ship size (carriers have smaller models atm than the praxis, lol)? It's a passive downside to bringing large groups of caps through a cyno that only comes with drawbacks for one side and doesn't introduce new offensive mechanics that can be exploited. This would also help counter massive cap blobs jumping through a single cyno but in a more balanced way.
---
Lmao what is this revisionist history.
---
The narratives at play here are so transparent I cant even.
---
Well I was casually exploring and spotted 7 hecates molesting a defenseless citadel. Not on my watch, luckily I had a strategic asset cache nearby. So I reshipped, blapped one and his pod, the rest warped out, then returned to feed me 2 more. Could've had another one but I slingshot myself way too far. Noticed a 2h fortizar armor timer in the same hole, but they didn't show up.
---
Digi sent me an anal probe and I am carrying it ever since.
---
If someone has gone to the site before you, it'll spawn the rats after 15 minutes.  Use a venture and you're safe until then.  Avoid the ordinary peremiter deposit as that one has turrets to start.  You can check out ninja huffing videos on www.youtube.com/thebravedojo

Good piloting display here
---
Stop
---
My town! Woo!
---
It might be in null sec, and I don't have a cloak. I'm also a fucking pussy.
---
I don't know about that, I do think there are fewer irl butts in seats though.
---
Eve is now so old that kids born after BOB fell are old enough to play.
---
Depending on the game we are talking about the bar drops below dumb to stone stupid...dumb as a rock
---
That’s the whole point safety is for people who just walk away for other out of game reasons.   People who walk away because their apace is under siege probably don’t deserve to benefit from the system.   That’s what all the ass hurt over safety is about.  It disincentiveizes content.
---
And no I’m not saying I’d do that intentionally.  I’m saying to defeat the stupid one month timer that’s all you’d need to do...................
---
Asset safety is a great example of a well intended system gone a bit off and has unintended effects.
---
My method is that if I enter an inhabited wormhole, I initiate warp to all sites, then in lieu of targets to attack, I move on to the next hole.
---
He’s still here ...
---
Similar in Dodixie.
---
I find it asinine that Jita has cheaper prices on everything Gallente.  The stuff in Dod is significantly overpriced, like RAHs being 10 mil.
---
Would love to see someone with market knowledge fix these other "trade hubs."
---
Economic theory assumes markets are efficient. There is a lot of profit to be taken when people are lazy.
---
The other thing is that market movers go after trade volume so they end up in Jita, only small fish chase high margins in low-volume sales.
---
Many low-class gas sites can be cleared in battlecruisers etc, bigger ones can be done with sniping MJD battleships, just google the site and see how much damage/neut it does, however a professional ninja huffer specializes in Instrumental Cores and speed tanks the 4 battleships in a Prospect, or just cleans the whole site with alot of accounts before the sleepers spawn.
---
A Venture is fine, a [Gnosis](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77135549/) can be great support because of the mining link.

warp cloaked in site, orbit 320 cloud, see where auto orbit takes you, fly 35k away from the sleepers in that direction, then you can decloak, orbit the cloud and go afk

"Some final words: as a goon, you should be the last person on reddit that posts about a lack of content."
---
With respect, your attempt at gatekeeping my wanting to have fun in Eve will be ignored by me.
---
As for Co2, that was not done for fun, though fun was had.  That was due to the history that Co2 and the Imperium had.  Some bad blood there, regardless of whose side you believe. 
---
Tell you more about your "role"? OK  NC/PL used to be what we are today.  The biggest/baddest alliance.  The ones who decided who could have supers in the game.  The reality is if the NC/PL of old were magically here as a separate entity they could curb stomp you.  And, frankly I want you to be that again.
---
"ncpl is undocking and fighting you almost daily during this "war", at least when you bring only 2 times our numbers or less. you can't expect us to feed our 100 man gang to provide content for your 600 spodbrains."
---
It must be the timezone I am in then. The closest to fighting you guys I have come has been in a 200ish ship fleet.  We had to wait for a while so you could form up and you did form a fleet of nearly the same size, called in horde too, we called in another fleet not sure of the size.  All that happened was we all snarled around space a bit and went home.  I have done things in NC. Space in the past, in peacetime too.  Don't recall fighting anyone in NC. though.  Last night I was in another 150 ship fleet, with no other support.  In NC . space.  The only people who undocked was  Horde.  Two Hordelings repeatedly attacked the fleet.  Other than that your space felt kinda lonely, we destroyed 1 structure and reffed another.  No response fleet.
---
"yeaaaaah, the renter space is the problem this game has, lol. you don't seem dumb, pls use your brain and think outside of your goon war propaganda."
---
Fun fact, I don't really pay attention to our propaganda.  My opinion on renter space is my own thoughts.  The data released by CCP shows that most of the botting bans are associated with specific groups/regions.  All the blather aside, that coincides with repeated posts by concerned players reporting bots in rental areas that are associated with those same groups/regions.  The exception being the dronelands, which suffers from poor design by CCP with a lack of NPC space providing a very safe area.  Additionally, renter corps that are legitimate players have to work to pay their rent, are subject to restrictions by their landlords, and due to this I feel they do not get the chance to fully live up to their potential.  I feel this is not a good thing for the game as it currently exists.  I just do not have a good solution.
---
As for the horde thing, they may be their own alliance.  But they go at the beck and call of Pandemic Legion.  They have fought for them in the past as cannon fodder, for PLs bennefit. But they do not seem to be treated equally. This is why I think of them in that light.  That aside, I have never gone wanting for a fight with horde around.  They undock and fight regularly.  But, I see and hear many not giving them the respect that they surely have earned at this point. 
---
"Don't try to make others responsible for the decisions of the goon leadership that hasn't actually logged into eve for such a long time that they forgot what the actual goal of this game is: having a fun time with friends and internet spaceships."
---
I have flown with various members of the Goon leadership.  Had fun too.  I am not blaming others for their decisions.  Rather I expressed my hopes for the future. 
---
"If you want my advise: leave goons like I did a few months ago and join another group that doesn't just focus on outnumbering enemys. Skill urself is really cool, snuffed out too, or Volta. Or maybe fraternity if you prefer something larger."
---
I'm sure those groups are nice, but I like my space jobs here.  I help others learn how to fight and have fun,  I take people out on random trips to go have fun, and I help new players get started.  Snuffed would not even deign to reject me with my killboard, and not to be unkind, but I do not know the others at all.  That aside, I do not think I have to leave to be good, or to contribute in a positive way for the game.  If you left and are happy then I am happy for you.  I am happy here.

scan it down and warp to it. click on it and 'show info'. this will tell you where it leads to. and if you got a few mil left, just fit a t1 explo ship with the intention to loose it. now go in there and enjoy the adventure. dont forget to bookmark the wormhole exit ;)

I like they're making progress on 2FA. I'm hoping they're working behind the scenes to allow proper master-account linking so once 2FA is set up on one account, every other account sharing the same verified email would inherit the same 2FA.

Then make it either a) mandatory or b) heavily incentivised to set it up.
---
gokus originally had bomb launchers. I believe pgl designed them in nulli, not test?
---
anyhow they're called that because they would "spirit bomb," one of gokus signature moves. to execute the maneuver, all of the bombers pull a tight orbit around the anchor, in the  middle of the hostile fleet,and all launch their bombs at the same time, in all directions

null sec is mostly empty and you can always see who's in system with you. It's most likely goes through a wormhole though, not to nullsec, which is a bit more dangerous and exciting!
---
You know damage caps have nothing to do with “Fozzie Sov” right?
---
Aegis (Fozzie) Sov is the entosis links you use on TCUs, iHubs and nodes in Sov campaigns.
---
Damage caps are related to the Upwell structures (citadels, ECs, Refineries, FLEX’s)
---
i mean,go look at every good small gang specialized group in the game, you'll find that that its rarely the case youll have 10 ppl, generally 3-5 with alts. The downtime is far too huge for it not to be the case.
---
This is the answer really, there is a decline in pop combined with well high not having been a great place to be for a long time. Also these days the price difference between Jita and Amarr is insane making it well worth flying the 12 jumps to Jita to buy there instead, I seen savings of up to 30% on a fully fitted ship frigate to BB hulls. So yeah combine it all and Amarr is just loosing it's charm more and more.

They should need it. Capitals should be strategic assets deployed carefully and for maximum effect. Not instant "I win" buttons.

What did the Developer say to the DBA?
---
It doesn't matter, the answer is "No".
---
At this point I wish CCP would just sell the EVE IP to someone who knows what they're doing and is actually motivated to do what's best for the game.
---
Either that or start hiring from the community. This game has dozens if not hundreds of talented individuals with programming experience and the will and motivation to do what is necessary to make EVE great. These people should be driving development.
---
So many stories. I mailed my first born son from Australia to the U.S to join Goons.
---
Better put sov mechanics in place that in Nullsec there aren't big powerblocks and blue coalitions, if e.g. Ally A blues Ally B, then both allies have to pay ISK for it, and let's say for each member in the other ally, you have to pay let's say 10mil/month per member.
---
And to make it sense to blue someone, other then to work together, also using their structures for example,  you have to be blue to get on access lists.
---
As of Ally B with say 10k members, to blue them, that would cost Ally A around 100b/month. so if blueing a big powerblock like Goons/Test/PH it would cost you real big/month.
---
If you blue Ally A with say 5k members, it would make 50b/month. For small allies it would not be possible to blue half of eve or they would be out of isk after some month.
---
Also it could be costs more isk/month/member if the ally is bigger, and cheaper if the allie is smaller. It would also make it possible for CCP to get isk out of the game!
---
\-------------
---
Otherwise you can make the costs per member in your corp for blue-ing someone else. So if i have let's say 2000 member with 10mil/month, that ally has to pay 20b/month for blueing any other ally, so if you blue 3 other allies it would be 60b/month, and so on.  
---
If you have an ally with 15kmembers and blue one other ally that would costs you 150b/month.
---
\---------
---
The 10mil/month/member is just a example for how it could work, it could be more/less def. as if only 1 or after 5 you pay more or less for the next ones....
---
The PLEX you spent on the "Joke Police" SKIN was clearly a *great* investment.
---
doesnt it necessarily go through a wormhole? can Kspace-Kspace holes exist?
---
Extreme example: every member of an alliance a citadel is in can unanchor set citadel, docking rights have 2 modes free port or alliance only, this would remove the ability for groups that don't trust the members to use citadels ( and the ability for holding corps as well now you have to free port them ). 
---
now sure that's extreme and likely not good for the game either but there are absolutely permission based solutions to hurt big groups that can't trust their line members, whereas smaller groups tend to be able to vet there member base better. 
---
&gt; If you force fleets to spread out and avoid concentrating in one place, we'll just send more, smaller fleets.
---
Most big blocs lack the FC's to pull that one off plus it's a lot more painful for 1 person to managed 50 fleet's spread out over 25 systems than to manage a big ball of spaceships meaning it forces independent decisions by fleet members and massive fuck ups are gonna happen, this creates niches for small groups to walk away with little wins. 
---
you will hate this counterpoint but if you take 10 random people of a small entity and 10 random people of a big bloc and force them to pvp on the spot the small group will often come out ahead as they tend to have a higher % of older and more skilled pvpers ( now in an AT like setup this doesn't apply because the sampling is far from random ). 
---
As for the killing thing well that's just a reduction in how much it sucks right now, to be the small group like a lot of folks would be happy if they walk away from such a drop with 1 or 2 kills and dreads right now need way to large a number for that to be made happen by small groups on a large entities home defense super ball. 
---
like it's not about winning it's about killing something.
---
100% best use of dev time. /s
---
does foreskin count? asking for my goon alt
---
I agree with you. All I am saying is that the "low cost,relatively easy to screen if done properly by subcaps, that doesn't fuck over the rest of the subcap meta and small group capital usage (rorqs for example)" doesn't exist yet and that massive aoe is not the solution.  
---
The idea of focused bombs might be worth looking at, but will still hurts small groups more
---
Well at that point FEDUP was too big for the dead FW scene so where to go next ? Some sov somewhere, unfortunately down south.
---
There was no way we could sustain any sort of defence against Snuffs supers. I don’t think fighting until all our stuff is destroyed and we’re asset safetying all over the place is the way to go. Snuff wanted our PB pocket. They offered, we accepted. Better that than scorched earth.
---
You were away then. Yes and you know what, a whole bunch of us thought about you and what you’d come back to, because you were one of the guys everyone likes. 
---
That said FEDUP wanted to try and forge themselves into something more self sustaining. FW being LP based means the alliance was poor! Null provides the means to strengthen. I suppose the joke there is the drop off in numbers of people who didn’t like null (half of ALWAR) and then Aideron leaving which weakens the alliance. That was sad. I was in Aider and enjoyed my time. My ALWAR corp mates who I always flew with, left too, but I didn’t want to really go back to lowsec, just dip my toe in every once and a while and I think there’s a whole load of us like that. 
---
But you know you cannot tell someone else how to have fun or how to spend their time. I happen to love null and I’m never short of things to do. I enjoyed OICX and EHA massively, and FW too as a medium to learn to fight, but for me the repetitive nature of reshipping, losing, reshipping again, rinse repeat, was not enjoyable long term. Strat ops and CTAs are fun for me. Roaming, a bit of ratting here and there, wh diving, and sov assault and defence I find enjoyable. So FEDUP is rebuilding, it’s a change, it’s not ideal but that’s where we are. 
---
Everyone has their motivations. We love Aider and wish them the very best, and none of us are against any of our former FW militia chums from any group. I don’t fully understand the wangs situation, never have, and don’t care; it seems to involve only a select few who argued about alignment and not the average line member. 
---
Anyway a bit of a rant and probably on the wrong thread. o7

Hello. Dunno why ingame links wouldn't work, mine do.

Once you've done that, it works pretty much flawlessly. I'm running the 64 bit client with max settings and don't experience any pronlems. If you need any help, write me a PM and I'll try to help out.
---
To add to the news report, some of these fights were part of wormhole evictions. If a citadel gets destroyed in wormhole space, there's no asset safety, the loot just spills into space. You can probably double or triple the amount of ISK lost during those evictions because of the amount of ISK taken from the citadels. A lot of them are basically left with what they managed to extract to k-space (sometimes, hole control is maintained, so nothing was saved), the ship they were flying at the time (a lot of them safe log in space with a hauler, carrying their most expensive possessions) and whatever's left in their wallet.
---
Also: Anal probes. Anal probes everywhere.
---
They hit a farm so we fought back when the farm nagst that was already in system. We obviously brought refits, and something more blingy than what they had. They fucked up on target calling tho, they killed the first dread almost instantly because it landed alone due to a botched warp. Then they spent 20 min almost trying to kill our scorpions thru 13 guardians instead of fragging the other nag because scorps kept jamming their vindicators. When they finally killed the scorps we had a nag left, they had the two apostles

---
I'm torn between the two ideas of if something is overpowered you should either

Ignore it and dont use it because its overpowered.

or
---
Abuse the shit out of it to bring attention to it. 
---
Obviously, Goons have chosen the latter.

Which might be the better option if you want to get it changed but it doesnts stop people from feeling salty.
---
Doomsdays on dreads is pants on head retarded. Same with doomsdays on Fortizars.
---
The thing is, though, I don't think it would necessarily fuck over small groups. Bombers are very specialised ships with precisely one viable tactic: Hit and run. And they're remarkably easy to counter if you have basic D-scan skills. This doesn't mean they aren't destructive to a large fleet but it does make them relatively easy to plan around when you have a small alliance.
---
I'm not opposed to the solution of just buffing torpedo damage on bombers, though. This would have the added benefit of forcing bombers to maintain contact with the enemy to do their damage and would force them to focus on medium/large targets.
---
Personally, I think the T1 ships need to be weaker and T2 ships need to be more specialised, across the board. Every T2 ship should have one specific purpose, one specific tactic, one specific thing that it is good at countering. Let the T1 ships be mediocre generalists and the T2 ships be exceptional at specific roles. This will help force people to introduce some diversity to their fleet comps and help to dismantle the N+1 advantage through diminishing returns and the option to fight smarter instead of harder.
---
All of the groups mentioned above are a good place to start. I’d wholeheartedly recommend:
---
Aideron Robotics - new pilot and veteran friendly, a great bunch of guys currently repositioning themselves in the warzone so a perfect time to join up.
---
Sons of Luminaire - focused EU group, good skills. 
---
Villore Accords - are a smart group who I’ve always respected.
---
yes he is
---
We used to get like 10k sp for each first kill per account, each day.
---
I'm in 2 minds about it returning, leaning towards it being a bad thing right now, but not with any real conviction.
---
They experimented with offering 10k skill points for your first NPC kill of the day a couple of years ago but I believe that they concluded that it did not notably affect player login numbers and there was quite a strong negative sentiment towards it. As a result they decided to remove it.

Titan costs put them outside of the welp 10 to get a super kill realm, the core issue is that lack of a cheap capital sized alpha hull ( read a tornado for caps ).

its fun in the short term but casuals dont stick around , the hardcore player is the ones who have kept eve alive all these years and skilll injectors and all this other shite has destabilised the game and its economy, made goons super powerful and made me lose interest in anything other than reddit commenting, community development teams getting sacked and korean micro transaction companies taking over, all in all its the goons i feel sorry for all those minerals mined and supers built will be useless when the servers get the shutdown notice

I agree bpc's shouldn't be counted as worthless, but as it needs more zero-point condensate's than i have it would be akward to try to find the most profitable use of the loot.  
---
it's been many years since i mined in highsec but i can believe this, the only issue here is would they with lesser skills still take about the same time to finish them. so i guess this one is open for discussion.
---
For anyone thinking about this, I highly recommend that you do so, liberally, and to every available port on your computer and bit of electronics you own...

Again the goal isn’t to instantly delete assets.

It is to provide a counter to something that is currently un-counterable.

---
What about doing T2 instead of T1?
---
What? Am I the only one selling items in Amarr? I made X billion isk over the past Y days selling a variety of modules and ships. Selling every item you can think of T1, T2, faction, etc. I like to sell it in Amarr &gt; Jita because I can make more isk raising the price ever so slightly. A LOT of people would rather spend extra rather than do 10 jumps to Caldari space and back. OP doesn't know what he's talking about.
---
The true evil of N+1 advantage is "everything you do a bigger group can do as well with more numbers" (there is no such thing as specialists in the age of skill injection. We can't go back to T3 ahacs with T2 logi vs battleships/canes/drakes).  
---
The EVE community is very good at exploring new ways to use the tools CCP gives them.  
---
One of the most recent examples are command destroyers. Many people loved them when they were introduced and there was a lot of stuff like spearfishing (and I think a goon welped a mach fleet by taking a wrong turn).  
---
Now everyone is hating on the unkillable jump ravens.
---
Nice flying as usual Jokastis, miss you guys. Great video, great piloting. GG my man.
---
well seeing as people don't do all of them and the amount is going down i would have to say no not that odd.  
---
so if someone only runs darks he would have only 11, leaving him to sell the 35 other ones for dark ones to keep going with t1 darks.  
---
As for those who want to sell them from data sites, this still works although in my experience there is a very small group of explorers who even run data sites to begin with.
---
what counter would you suggest against someone having N+1 F1 monkeys in carriers/supers/titans?
---
I think you just reinforced what's being said. 
---
\-Prices high due to  low trade volume
---
\-Nowhere near the availability of modules/ships that there used to be(generally causes prices to increase) 
---
So that would make sense that you are making more ISK due to the market becoming less like a second Jita and more like Hek or Rens
---
This wouldn’t be subject to n+1 though because it is only effective against specific grouped targets. Sure every major fight would then want a squad of these bombers ready to go just in case. But it can’t just be used in anyone to delete targets. 
---
Both sides would be forced to spread forces out, the one that doesn’t gets punished. That’s nothing to do with n+1
---
So there is a step process we go through typically:
---
* 1. Bring attention to the potential abuse, whether it be CSM or in-game reports. If this is ignored...
---
* 2. Get real loud and more elaborative in explaining and illustrating how this issue should be given attention. If this is ignored...
---
* 3. It's a ~game feature~! Since it's acceptable and everyone else is using it then we scale it up to alliance/ coalition level and watch how quickly everyone starts screeching. A change is then introduced, op success.
---
But they don’t, because it is more risk having them spread out. And no risk to dropping them altogether. That’s the main point of this post
---
Maybe, just maybe you wussies should stop ship spinning and actually undock. There's tons of content out there and if you stopped being bitter vets and opened your eyes, you might have fun with the rest of us.
---
It's been in decline since 2016 pretty safe to say it's dying
---
When people start doing resource wars. CCP demands sacrifice first.
---
Honestly the ship size and cost doesn’t bother me. I was imagining a cruiser size bomber because that’s the role that would fit it best. They would have to be expensive cause they would be powerful. 
---
But even at 1-2 bil a piece it would be worth having then there in case
---
Actually, it is. Securing accounts and providing a better UX is always time well spent.
---
Sounds more like a fringe trade hub than the 2nd busiest trade hub in Eve that it used to be.
---
if you are attempting to claim my post is false in some form or fashion then you either don't play EVE or just don't pay attention at all
---
I used to sell mostly in Dodixie.  The less active the hub, the greater the margins (as you are competing with fewer other market mogul types).  The lower Dodi got as a hub, the greater my margins and profit from selling there.  But it eventually got too thin to move all I was producing.
---
If there is still activity and less competition you will make higher margins and the volumes are still there for some market types to get movement, but that doesn't mean it isn't in decline.
---
Well when the alarmists cry wolf so many times you never do see it coming before you're gobbled up.

If I find myself with some extra time then I will personally go find the battle reports illustrating the 250-500 man subcap fleets GOTG were fielding while NCPL circle jerked around in supers.

Idk why this sub is so depressing.
---
Why? As long as it is a challenge to use, and the ships doing it can be countered, burst damage could be a great way to add more aspects of engagement with larger and larger fleets.

It's like your hearing a non existant narrative that has nothing to do with what's really going on, lol

Better be a female version for my pilot *shake fist*
---
I would propose a change to cyno mechanics:  
---
You only have a certain amount of mass you can jump to a cyno before weird stuff happens, like ships landing on different spots on grid or modules getting random (bad) modifiers.  
---
Basically you can drop 50 caps on a single cyno within a certain distance, everything further else means that you are rolling mutaplasmids on your fleet.
---
Effects can be removed at stations/citadels (and yes, modules in your cargo/fleet hangars are affected as well to stop you from just refitting)
---
No, they weren't - if they were then they would have pushed back until some restrictions or revisions were made.
---
Well judging by the shit this community pushes I have to go with yes, apparently goons are the only ones with the foresight to play changes out beyond the first few days.
---
no
---
Wherever you are,  wherever you go... always have your cyno chain to jita ready.
---
I jumped low sec (0.4) to low sec (0.2) last week, put be 32 jumps away the old fashioned way.
---
Accelerators uhm... Always good o/
---
Well, thats exactly my point. IMO it was a huge missed opportunity to make datasites actually worth something. 
---
Now, we have this almost self sustaining abyss cycle instead of one activity providing the materials for a other activity. As it usually works quite well in EVE.
---
IMO, every tier should only drop higher tiers. Or drop no filaments at all and have all tiers provided by datasites.
---
Why is this a problem? If the fleet has done something dumb, and out themselves in a situation where they can die. Why shouldn’t they? Because they cost more? 
---
If a titan jumps undated of bridging, it deserves to die. And in this situation if the fleet all jumps to 1 cyno, They deserve to die. 
---
Entire fleets get deleted all the time, 
---
Bosons wiping out entire fleets cause of a bad warp ins.
---
Pipebombs wiping fleets because of bad scouts.
---
Bomber runs killing entire fleets cause they stay still to long. 
---
Even suicide thrasher fleets to take out smaller ships.
---
A fleet getting wiped is fine, even good. If they person getting destroyed made a mistake to get in that situation.
---
“This goes back to, ah, my dear, this is what the bitter vets call the disbanding of BOB, you weren’t born yet then..."

It’s funny because I look for the wh’s, closing wh’s is the best pve in eve.
---
So does jita 4-4. In both cases they'll probably have terrible indexes though (closely followed by perimeter :P)
---
There used to be several people who daily shipped high value, DST sizes shipments to amarr from Jita.
---
They've been gone for months now, and this is evidently the result.
---
Nope, you are not. I started flying them again too, not the squishy fit, but I started flying them again.
---
HS in general is kinda shit to live in. You can base out of NS with equal or more safety and way way more profit
---
I see the problem as their is no counter to a huge capital fleet. Except a larger capital fleet. 
---
Sure you could just change the amount of mass that can for through a cyno. But this would Method would add content in the way of the new bomber pilots, more defender pilots, more fights to clear defender pilots, more spread out fights.
---
Sometimes when the mood strikes I like to find me a thera hole, and find another near somewhere else I've lived and have left assets behind... move those assets, dont have to waste any cyno juice or shunt alts around. Also keeps my blunted trash tier probing abilities a red cunt hair this side of total shit.
---
Doesn’t sound all that far-fetched to me.
---
I once joined a corp, their intake was about what I’d expect to have to go through on the way to joining the CIA.

Again no context from some rando trying to be edgy.

A waffle thanatos died because my bait Loki died, because I hard committed to a Vargur that was being skiddish as a trout. Must be the hardcore fuckup you are trying to make it out to be. Fyi,  you miss 100% of the shots you don't take. 
---
Then I rejoined PL, and convinced a couple waffles that sitting in waffles waiting to join snigg was a fruitless endeavour, and vocuhed them into PL.  I would go into detail about that, but it is water under the bridge. Reza has done an amazing job as The One True Waffle Khan. I still suggest it to anyone who doesn't want to join a big block, but wants the same level of content. 
---
Anything else randowaffle?
---
Can't be done.  I say this as someone who used to supply Dodi as my major market.  The volumes declined, so prices got pushed up.  No single producer or trader can supply even Dodi's volume as it is now with enough product to bring down the prices and PERHAPS attract enough consumers to raise the volume.  
---
So they continue to price .01 isk below the last price and as the volumes thin the competition leaves and the margins between buy and sell increase.  And more consumers leave.  etc. etc.
---
If you want to see what a market looks like where volumes increase, check out Delve.  I am not hugely familiar with it, but I will bet you will find that its margins have been decreasing as the volumes and competition have increased.
---
And even 3-5 years ago there was nothing like Jita.  I could sell units, and sometimes a few, in Dodixie, but if you sell in Jita you can regularly sell 10-20 times that in single orders.  That might be a corps logistics guy buying a bunch of doctrine ships for an op.  Even small corps can have someone stocking a few dozen ships all at once.
---
Too many new players have joined the Goons blob though. It's sucking life out of the game.
---
Not if the math doesn’t make it worth it. I see it unless there is 50-100 capitals within the radius the bombs would be effectively useless. That means if you are organized you can bring as many capitals to a fight as you want without them getting bombed.
---
Maybe I don't know how to use the tool, but I can't seem to find a way to expand the time frame to earlier than the beginning of the year. Also, the last link isn't working. 
---
Looking at [this](https://www.adam4eve.eu/location.php?id=60008494) page though, you can see a noticeable drop in traffic from around 40k jumps per day around 2016 to about 20k recently. That's a 50% decrease in traffic. 
---
You can't tell me that there's no indicator that Amarr is seeing less activity. Just because the amount of ISK being traded hasn't dropped significantly doesn't mean overall trade hasn't. The thread has several responses where people are talking about making up to triple the ISK on trades vs Jita. That's the sign of a fringe trade hub, not a central trade hub like Amarr used to be. I would expect those kinds of margins in Hek or Rens.
---
There are a lot more bots today than there were before, note Frat having double digit % of bots in eve's ENTIRE HISTORY since 2017. There's very likely a real decline in actual human beings playing this game; bots don't count, nullsec bot-aspirants barely count, etc.
---
Then don't log in or grind it.   Like the rest of us.  LMAO.
---
Lmao
---
TBH i tried to sell stuff in amarr now and then, but it's taking waaaaaay to long find a buyer, so i moved to jita.
---
Thats how it works, if no one buys your stuff,  the seller moves away, the fewer seller there are, the more customers move away due to a lack of price competition and range/offer so that even more sellers move away- see detroit for reference
---
Nah.  If there were things to ship the contracts would be there and the truckers would move them.  The shipping doesn't make the market, the market makes the shipping.
---
Huh, I could swear it didn't. Must have been cloning facilities.
---
people would get caught doing dumb stuff to get their one NPC kill each day
---
Well, after prettying up everything before the sale, Pearl Abyss is now looking to recoup the money they spent and then making a healthy profit. Regarding side projects, if you don't have any you're dead sooner or later. I am more worried about the lack of them than anything else.
---
Boxing 7 hecates gone wrong!

This is a good counter point, you are right the servers might not be able to handle this at the moment.

Actually those could be LP rewards from resource wars.    
---
Like the **only** issue with resource wars was lack of reward.         
---
You where literally losing isk by doing those sites.         
---
^(quite often the reward you got from this LP store was more expensive than the same stuff you could buy from open market)

Sorry was  confused. You kept mentioning ‘we’ and I thought you were someone relevant. My bad.

If you lose account logins, verify cache and restart computer, works every time I lost logins.

If you try that and you still lose logins AND settings, probably check for malware and reinstall

Sound good plan but I don't have tech required to run clocks. As I started the game 4 days ago
---
Lemme guess, goons put the child porn their hmm?
---
Don't really know what is implied by the foul play. I believe the original poster really thinks amarr declined. The question is if that is true or not. Maybe he tried to buy some fits and the last three times he could not buy all of it in amarr. It also recently happened that Jita didn't have some basic stuff like T1 hulls. Those things happen from time to time.

Mining ledger shows system and what you are mining. I am far from an expert in the eve API but I would not be supprised if the API is unable to do amount without also giving the tool location and type of rock.
---
"unintentional" 0.o?
---
That does work but it makes looking for rorqs take 10x the time and effort that looking for a ratting carrier does using in game tools.
---
Flair baiting grr goon troll. Check his comment history.
---
and I qoute "Next on the list is tier 2 darks"
---
This should theoretically be possible using the mining ledger; does it pull via the API? 
---
If so, you just need the corp APIs plugged in and it can pull the data.
---
In your extreme example, spies would make Citadels untenable for anyone. In more moderate versions of the same, good spies would make alliances untenable. 
---
I do want to say that I'm not against the idea of limiting supercapital creep (all evidence to the contrary). If it were set up so that only one Titan in a fleet (or even within a particular range) could use their DD within a set amount of time, that would be both justifiable and sensible. But you can't tell players "the universe is yours" and then handcuff the ones who actually work to make it theirs. I don't mean that you shouldn't; I mean you literally can't because organized and experienced players will always figure out some emergent gameplay that keeps them moving forward.
---
there were once but they got bullied out of the game by war deccers.
---
bullied out of the game, listen to yourself
---
No.
---
The volumes of items I shift have gone up whilst prices have stagnated and in some cases reduced. The statistics I track clearly show an increase in the number of items I have sold, at least in the 150-200 items that I regularly trade.
---
I had to ship the Mittani my HDD so it could be professionally examined along with my first born child in order to join. It was well worth it, I hope little Timmy is doing ok.
---
I think my bee furry porn collection helped me to joined back then
---
The guys who are active are making mad isk and paying for overpriced goods.  Too much effort to jump around to save a few mil when you can make more of it by staying local and krabbing.

The ones who can't afford it are probably today in Karma or Panfam and have local sources for their needs, which are standardized.

---
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH FUCK !!!
---
Think of how much more money CCP will make when they keep open only the Delve server and just sell subs to spod miners and anom ratters.
---
I think what happend in general is that ccp tried to make data sites worth it with the filaments, but as most people who are interested in abyss have little to no scan skills it would lead to a market for it. 
---
This new group of abyss runners went on to quickly surpass the data site runners, and being bigger their intrests would have counted for more. 
---
This leading to ccp either not changing the drop rates of filaments or allowing them to drop in the abyss, dont know which was first.  
---
In the end I figured they wanted to make more appeal for the abyss as it still would count as a isk sink, which seems to be the main drive of ccp at the moment
---
That's gay.
---
I have been tracking things such as the volume of items sold, profit per item etc. on all of my trade alts for several years.
---
My Amarr alt can clearly track a steady increase in the volumes of items sold since 2016. At least, this is the case on the 150-200 items I regularly sell there.
---
I know you joke but some people really would believe that. I think Goons have been happy to farm industry for last few years in the hope of this cathartic 'ultimate battle' against the North. All they will get is some structure bashes though. The subs will drop off....
---
Also, not from a moon. I know POSes are getting removed, but I'm still scarred by that time I warped to a moon as my reference point for making a safe spot, and ended up getting decloaked by a POS turret that promptly killed me.
---
No, it means if I am organized I will jump expendable max hp caps into the enemy cap fleet, then proceed to nuke everything
---
Krabs are more afraid of you than you are of them.
---
Legit made 20 goons dock up flying a rifter 5 jumps into delve.
---
Has your volume gone up or has the market volume gone up?  As the market declines players might leave and more of the market share is now yours.
---
That could also be due to less people selling there, so you have a higher percentage of the overall traded volume. Just saying. Your statistics can be saying something completely different depending on how you look at them
---
It's not really a tool but simple a site with several useful graphs. I didn't do a in detail analysis but said that looking shortly at the stats I can't see anything outside of usual fluctuations.
---
Regarding the traffic drop, if we're looking at the same graph then there was also a spike before. Btw, the very last data point is usually wrong in most eve graphs because they haven't accumulated the data yet. That's why the last data point always points down a lot. Another thing are the time scales. You speak of a time scale since 2016. That's 2.5 to 2.3 years ago. The original post spoke of may. That's maybe 1.5 months or 0.125 years ago. So, if you want to speak of a decline since 2016 then this is a different statement which we can surely discuss if you want.
---
Usually you define amount of trade by volume in money per time unit. You can surely look at other indicators for the relevance of a trade hub, too. But you actually don't do that but now point towards hearsay to make a point which actually don't even support the original statement. Namely people calim to make more isk in Jita than Amarr. I don't know if it's true. I guess it depends on what you do. If you want to know if Amarr declined you have to know how that developed anyways and not only how things are right now. And you need to know more than "my impression is" or "I was in Amarr and now I'm in Jita and make more isk". Amarr was always about an order smaller as a trade hub than Jita. Personally, I can't judge if that increased or decreased.
---
Well, so is any PvE in this game, abyssal being the least boring IMO.
---
Sadly your comment only expresses opinions which might or might not be right. (In my opinion some are probably right.) But nothing to support those opinions.
---
Edit: Btw, those opinions are even unrelated to the original post and my comment. An increase in bots could lead to an increase in trade.
---
Kspace-Kspace holes aren't much rarer than Kspace-Jspace holes, they actually might be slightly more common. You have to keep in mind that when a Kspace-Kspace hole appears, that's actually creating two holes, since both ends are in Kspace. So if Kspace-Jspace were created equally as often as Kspace-Kspace, then there would still be twice as many Kspace-Kspace holes as Kspace-Jspace holes.

It's funny you say this, as I literally gave up trading in Amarr because no-one would buy my gear, why bother stocking it when the sales were just so pathetic I might as well stay in Jita.

I suggest moving the quality to maximum once in a while. Eve is actually a very good looking game.

T4s seem to be a little too high pressure to get all the boxes, for me anyways. Granted, I haven't run that many of them though.

Maybe with a little more practice I could get my times down some more.
---
I think what OP is saying that he did not have high GPU usage until recently. Indicating that something might be wrong. That a GPU can handle high load does not mean much.
---
And it’s bad if new tactics like that appear? And then best case scenario is losing bunch of your own ships!!
---
cheap imicus, no implants , go crazy in those c1-c2-c3 relics. often these wormholes are dead with few connections and loads of relics. much better then the crap in k-space (because bots dont run them...yet)
---
It's an interesting spin. Which goons were these, different from the "kill the game so we can declare victory on SA and move on with our lives" goons?
---
It’s too slow and meh for me to recommend. I never liked it. Krabbing in wormholes is infinitely more fun for my play style.
---
Its still way better than dodixie
---
Youre happy know, but what happens when 10,000 bees show up in your backyard looking for places to mine and rat?
---
Metrics are opinions now. Yup, this is 2019 politics alright. Turn up the extremism and go march for that.
---
As a former Amarr/Dodixie resident, there was a significant decline in the active population after the introduction of market citadels. Don't know how much it was connected to citadels specifically, but there's way fewer people in local, less conversation, etc. My game wasn't market trading but I'd be pretty surprised if that *didn't* translate to less people stocking less stuff.
---
Let’s open the topic ! Can someone please tell me how I can link fittings on Reddit please ? Each time I try to do it, it’s like the text doesn’t return to the line and it’s unreadable...
---
This id now a WIDOT thread.
---
All any of us have to go from is personal testimony and what data can be extrapolated from the game, so you are really on no more solid footing than I am in that regard. 
---
The statistics you point to just show trade volume and ISK, which consist of any number of trade goods. Hardly solid evidence to refute the original posters point. Maybe the volume of PI materials went up while the volume of ship modules went down. You can't tell either way from the data you presented. 
---
I tend to go with my own observations coupled with available data and the observations of others. If those seem to be in agreement, then I tend to lean more towards that observation until proven otherwise.
---
This is BS, most people wouldn't consent to it (so they wouldn't have joined). If it was done without consent, it's a felony and a major international offence. Given their size, there would be a cybercrime/cyberterrorism (not sure which you'd call this since there's no money and no infrastructure) notice out for them as an organization.
---
This didn't happen so it's BS :)

Give us the song bitch
---
There's also a EULA rule saying they can ban you for literally no reason, so don't expect to game the system as they will ban you for simply existing and not paying up...
---
flair checks out
---
There's a graph presented earlier in the thread that shows a 50% decrease in traffic from 2016 to present. Maybe you just have less competition.
---
Good bot!

did you leave before the engineer grind, good for at least another year of time sink, also mining is a lot more fun a profitable now
---
Everyboy afraid o that fabled cyno rifter dropping supers left and right. :D
---
You leave an empty line between each line.
---
The game has lost more than half its playerbase in the last 5-6 years.  So less activity out of regional hubs is only to be expected.  On top of that though, we have a constant influx of liquid isk from plex/injectors/rorqs that are driving inflation ever upwards.
---
Fewer modules and ships are being moved, but they cost much more than they used to, so isk/day isnt as skewed as it should be.
---
This is part of a smear campaign against the Amarr Empire.

It's bad in the same way as boosh ravens are "bad". It's a tactic, there are many other tactics and only time will tell if it is gamebreaking.  
---
Being on the receiving end of a bomb run certainly sucks, but in most cases you are using ships that can be easily replaced.  
---
I am  sure a super fleet getting destroyed by a single bomb run would be a massive power shift. This would either mean no big supers used at all (we had that age as well, wasn't received too well) or even *bigger* blobs, because you need the screening fleets and have to split into smaller capital groups in different locations on the battlefield.

Good point, well made. I do not track those metrics. My volumes have certainly increased.

So, new player here. Um, hi.

Where can I go to buy SMALL quantities of things for my ships? Everything I see on the market tab is for heavy like, BULK purchases. I do not currently need (nor can I afford) 50 ion turrets. At most I need like.... 6. What do I do/where do I go if I just wanna buy ONE of something? Lol.

---
when you buy (or sell) on item on the market you can select the quantity. What you' seem to be talking about is the amount of a certain item within 1 sell order.
---
Lets say person A put up a sell order for 100 damage control I's  for 1000 isk each and person B puts up a sell order for the same item for 950 isk, but he only sells 5. 
---
You will see the two sell orders on the market but it doesnt mean you have to buy all of them. You can just buy 1 or X amount if its available. In this case you would max. be able to buy 105 damage control I's.
---
I have a similar suspicion but would love to see the data to confirm that. 
---
There are likely also other factors in play. 
---
- More local production / consumption in nullsec
---
- Jita area even more attractive due to low-tax / fee perimeter tradehubs
---
These are just guesses though.
---
or people just quit the game or went farming because it's easier
---
some bits of eve operate like the market, but don't forget that eve is just a market, not the market, and sometimes markets close and die forever
---
Its funnier to watch people straight up deny reality because its related to the bad goon man.

But how can we do them!? I can't find any and can't see them in the new Agency.

Lol what a load of shit, you guys actively delete stuff all the time because some snowflake might be offended
---
that's traffic in terms of system jumps not trade volume
---
Yeah. P I R A T is more popular than CODE, but that's just because they're honorable enough to wardec first.
---
I would log in every day for it, but I'd also fucking hate CCP for it. Especially as it would mean I'd have to keep leaving my wormhole on alts to get shitty highsec rat kills.
---
Many null blocs srp hulls instead of money at certain stage.
---
Look ma I tanked a DD
---
Because they shot first and didn’t stop to ask if they should be shooting at a fleet that could kick their ass until later... but I guess that’s kinda in the name.
---
The most recent blood raider one was epic for the first 24hrs while the loot table was broken, people were fighting over them, faction loot everywhere, then they fixed it and everyone stopped. They just need simple sites with loot worth having and no gates.
---
 Reintroduce passive moon mining with a moon re-balance that places a more geographical approach to moon mineral availability instead of just random seed, then make these moon minerals cycle quarterly to encourage fighting over resources and mobility of blocs. 
---
This, a lot of stagnation in null has been caused by this massive mistake of removing moon mining in its old form. Not only has it affected null sec it has made low sec pointless. And before everyone tells me it was aids and awful think on this.
---
Since its removal there are no reasons for the big blocks to move around and actually fight each other, there is no real reason as all of the factors of wars of the past had a financial base to them.
---
Low sec, well no moons no reason to be there? nothing to defend or attack?
---
Buffs to rorqs anoms and anything else that people throw into the mix would be irrelevant because a lot more supers and titans would be dying if they where being brought out to fight and not just shoot at structures, defending and attacking moons. 
---
These are contributing factors to way to many super,titans in the game, no conflict no loss, being able to sit in one region for ever equals no conflict, EVE IS CONFLICT.
---
True story: When I joined Goonfleet, I'd already been playing Eve for a few years. Vio Geraci convoed me to ask why I shouldn't be purged for being a j4g pubbie. But before I could answer, he found an old Eve-o forum comment I'd made back when Goons were flying around in Rifters (wherein I observed that they seemed to be having a lot more fun than everyone else and that they'd all be in battleships before we knew it), so he gave me a pass. That'll have been ten years ago next week.
---
I found it weird when he commented on the picture quality of my web cam afterwards.
---
Pretty good video (EPIC COMMENT)
---
More like Imperium and associates vs Panfam and associates.
---
The Rest of Eve are the third faction here.
---
This meme is dumb as the game is literally at some of the lowest individual player and activity numbers to date. It just dismissed the fact that the game is in an incredibly rough spot that has never been seen before.

Fuck that.

Give the Regions a "Health-meter". Then automatically balance the Health on the mining-average of all Regions. If you mine more than the average your health value goes down and Ore spawns in smaller amounts. Fuels conflict, balances overzealous spods and fucks the goons over. Win-Win.
---
Goons forced me to sign over the soul of my firstborn sirespawn so that Mittani (pbuh) could extend his lifespan and increase his psyker power.

Thanks bro, on mobile, didnt realize

My favorite is a guy a few weeks back who was claiming that after the sale, CCP was in no danger of being shut down because they were "flush with cash" after the sale. Because PA got rich by letting companies they own post losses before liquidating them

There is no getting the intern to do these things.  WiS is/was a complicated feature that required dev resources to maintain over time.  And CCP still spent time maintaining it for years when it was a dead end feature.  CCP only dumped it in the end in order to get a 64-bit client.  In addition to making the client more stable during large fights, 64-bit will be required for MacOS support in the near future.  Your sacrifice made the 64-bit client beta we have now, rather than a few years from now, possible.
---
meh
---
I am no military taction but if and army moved most of it's forces out on a northern front and they also have a "southern flank." it would seem like a good move for someone to attack there while they are distracted. Especially if you can believe the crab fishers saying delve is "weak" right now. But hey I keep out of politics and just like watching from the sideline.
---
I've had this issue since late 2017.
---
Sites in J space aren't significantly harder hacking-wise, and non-sleeper sites appear in C1-C3 systems, and from what I remember sleeper data/relic sites are rarely worth doing anyway.

You need at least 109 probe strength for those sleeper caches

I left because I learned skills 10 times slower than I learned the game. I got bored/frustrated. I ended up in null sec in a corporation as part of T.E.S.T. Fought in the war against AAA among other things. At the end of the day I was still in some little dinky ship waiting months so I could kinda fly something else. That’s why I left.

Asset safety was added to increase citadel uptake. Cargo delivery was to prevent contract scams. Neither were aimed at improving QoL for roaming PvP.
---
This has been an issue for a very long time and I'm fucking stoked its finally being adressed.
---
Thank you CCP, this will definitely improve numbers on mass-tests now that its not a pain in the ass to log into SiSi.
---
I would like a bar in the where to meet other capsulers in person

"you don't like one part of our update? you get nothing" -ccp
---
When are idiots like you going to understand that anything you suggest doing to “nerf” the bots/20 toon multiboxers/massive corps will have a much more devastating effect of the new/single toon/small groups?
---
That's exactly what a spy would say.
---
There used to be a pretty funny genre of posts that were obvious multiboxers complaining about delivered or hypothetical bans, like "my five roommates and I were banned because they think we're one guy multiboxing!" or "could they ban me if my girlfriend was sitting in my lap following me with a covops scout running on a virtual machine?"
---
Event to be sure.
---
You don't have a right to play this game. You play it at CCP's sole pleasure
---
They delete garbage posts from idiots, that's not the same thing as metagaming.
---
Stocks and shares? Are there any corporations selling shares to the public and paying out dividends? How legit is this?
---
What makes you think he "guilded his own comment" btw, because some random retard (Who is super into trump, so their logical thought process is questionable) said it was?
---
maybe if youre poor and only buy t2
---
Null sov has a “health-meter” called the industry index.  And works exactly opposite of what you suggest.  The more you mine the better class of ore anoms.
---
This really is like the chance for the 2 big power houses 45k accounts in GSF,42K in PanFam to fight against each other. Kinda sad because it would make for some great content on both sides.
---
⚠️Warning: Cesspool of goon cringe posting below⚠️
---
I did not understand most of it, but have to upvote red cunt hair everywhere.
---
The game is at 2007 numbers.  Ccp apparently thinks that the way to turn the tide is to double down on what they been doing the whole time the population has been slipping - more pve and a simpler and softer eve. At some point you would think that they would see that what they have been doing is at best not helping if not actually causing the problem.
---
These days, the solution to that is skill injectors. They were designed for this specific purpose. In other games you grind for weeks/months to "level up". In eve you can either choose not to grind and wait for weeks/months, or you grind for weeks/months (or even just hours/days) for ISK and buy injectors to "level up".
---
It's BS, scanning your HDD wouldn't tell them who your alts are.
---
That flair is epic
---
&gt;The more you mine the better class of ore anoms.
---
&gt;In a Game where conflict is Gameplay generator
---
Brilliant idea
---
They can still get 200 cerbs and 50 jackdaws to deal with our 8-10 man frig and dessie gang that camps the u-h gate in 9uy sometimes.
---
Gone sexual
---
You must be new here
---
Yeah almost every alliance now has 1 authentication platform you sign all your alts into 1 time. Then from that auth account you use any platform within the Corp / alliance
---
nerf respawn time of ore or makes the rocks smaller.  bam done. nerf to the massive corps, no nerf to small groups.
---
Sounds like pay to win tbh
---
By actually taking fights. Hardly feeding though. Lost 200, killed 130.
---
I'll never understand this weird sentiment of "mining and PVP are inherently exclusive activities; if one deigns to engage in even a little mining, their brains are forcibly and chemically altered to be forever more unable to engage in any form of PVP, amen."
---
Highly enjoyable!
---
Scalpel OP, btw.
---
Helps when you show POS-sticks on your dscan.
---
Honor in EVE? Gross.
---
Yeah. The Griffin issue comes from there being lots of Griffins on contract for cheap in-system. A number of people were already out on solo patrols in the doctrine Caracals to investigate sightings of war targets in something cheap and easy to replace, but with more teeth than the Griffin. Then the all-hands call came out that the Raitaru was under attack. Because some people were coming in from 28 jumps out, people seem to have just grabbed the first doctrine ship contracts that caught their eyes to immediately get in the fight rather than ask what was needed
---
:O
---
Been playing this way for about a month. Interestingly, I couldn't get Eve to run on my gtx770, probably because of the proprietary drivers, but have had no issues since upgrading to a Vega 56 and using the Mesa drivers.
---
I play at 1440p and framerates over 100fps. There's a bug where the window loses focus and the frame rate drops, but cycling in and out of the escape menu seems to temporarily fix it.
---
Who said that?
---
I hope you can agree that "your region devalueing" is a stronger driver to lash out to other regions than "your region gaining more and more value over time".
---
But hey, we can just wait another couple of years till CCP makes another overhaul on T2 production. Then the Sovmap will change a bit again.
---
Shares give voting rights. 
---
No dividends or stock market like you’re thinking.
---
I call complete BS. No self respecting Goon would use the pubbie term "toons".
---
\#Fake News.
---
Herons aren't that expensive. You're either going to carry back many times its worth or not lose much at all.
---
I see this as an absolute win!
---
T5 abyssal is 700M/hr. Way more than super ratting isn’t it?
---
Man... I was with them for a few weeks, albiet a line member, and honestly the atmosphere was way less dramatic. Most of those guys are just meme'ing it up, krabbing, and pvp'ing. I wasn't privy to the type of information you seem to have here, but honestly it seems like you weren't a good fit anyway.
---
.
---
Additionally, I remember some dude brought in a rattlesnake worth like 15b, and got it popped. I'm sure 5b is nothing to them honestly, and this post is probably being laughed at.
---
Probably should just let it go man. I doubt they gave it too much thought judging by how they put that discord message. It seems like you didn't pick up on that though.
---
If you think that the industry development index means "your region gains more and more value over time," I'd recommend some remedial instruction on sovereignty mechanics in Eve Online: Noted Space-Themed Spreadsheet.
---
By overview I assume you mean the right click menu, im pretty sure there is no way to hide it from the overview. If i'm in range it will show up on overview no matter what.

How much “content” in game is generated by ganking miners, hunting for orcas and rorqs, and gate camping haulers??

But that’s not the point of my comment above.  What OP is suggesting is opposite of current game mechanics and obviously doesn’t understand that

I don’t understand that either.  I mine AND I will shoot you in the face.

My only complaint with fuzzworks is no start over button in the blueprint screen to go back and check another item. Unless I’m retarded and missed it

It is allowed, if that's what you're asking.

Faction data/relics don’t have sleepers.
---
Those freaking hi-low sec bots. Hate them so much. I do wonder though if they warp to sleeper cashes and covert sites as well.

1 carbon in a Ruins can.

BRUTALITY!

Oh yes because nerfing the respawn rate of ratting sites just killed all the massive corps /s

Do SS officers qualify?

Awesome vid! Turn down the music please, I don't feel like it adds anything. Love that you guise are taking fights, shit
---
DRINK DRINK DRINK DRINK.

Other than that, the best way to start eve is to appreciate the fun side of it, make some friends and shoot some nerds, while doing your industrial stuff along the way. Passive vs active play, really. You can start by doing manufacturing and industry, but you'll probably not have a lot of active gameplay with those character skills.
---
Train some stuff to fly around and have fun, then get into manufacturing. Or just run two accounts for a while.
---
Definitely get a referral code to make your account, you get a lot more SP.
---
They even want to give you torpedoes
---
lol yeah... happens to me a lot.  (DOB 5-19-2003)
---
... until they check my killboard and see I clearly haven't played for the last 4 years.
---
I prefer a good money tank, too.
---
Thanks for the quick response.
---
Maybe I find someone willing to pay for 70 votes.
---
Yeah, cloning facilities are in one of the other stations in jita, i believe. Though it can be set as home station nowadays anyway for the medical clone.
---
Fake news
---
I remember Amarr being short on things about 5 years ago, pretty much the last time I went shopping there.
---
One of my favourite eve memories was my first time being tackle/scout for an Ivy fleet hunting a highsec pirate grp, probably these guys.  I was the guy to jump gate and tackle an approx. 1 bil macherial, and hold my own until the fleet could come and kill him in t1 frigs and dessies. 
---
His buddies ran the moment they realized i was tackle for a fleet even though i was a single merlin (somehow no one had something that could kill me? Not even drones)
---
I checked zkillboard for weeks after to see if he logged in/got kills... his board was empty for months. Made highsec a better place for a few months.
---
And ALWAYS be moving, aligned while scanning. If someone drops on you, just hit warp. And while you're in warp, save a random bookmark.
---
Jesus Christ now I remember that shit in  elementary. Are those people savage or what. Fucking assholes.
---
poor wording from me, but doesn't hugely change my message. If there wouldn't be infinite Ore in every system, poeple would spread out and create more conflict.
---
He's saying he uses Thera wormholes to consolidate loot across systems while also practicing scanning skills.
---
I mean, it's not like there aren't any retributions all over the place
---
huh?  what are you arguing?  that nerfs can't be applied that hurt massive corps more than smaller corps or that nerfs can't be applied that will kill massive corps?
---
you are all over the place and aren't making any sense.
---
I'm sorry to be the one to tell you this, but little Timmy got ganked while ratting in a super.
---
GMG are a bit retarded
---
&gt;How much “content” in game is generated by ganking miners, hunting for orcas and rorqs, and gate camping haulers??
---
No clue why what should magically stop if people search for ore in other systems but their home.
---
[Another source.](http://anoik.is/wormholes) Every wormhole in the game, from anywhere to anywhere. (Note that there are a few of these wormholes that never actually spawn, mainly the S047, N290, K329, and O128 C4-KSpace holes. There are no C4-KSpace holes other than M001/Q003 Nullsec Frig holes. But to my knowledge, all holes except those three do exist.)
---
Very helpful.  Thanks.  Like I said, I've been out of the game for 6 years.
---
Yeah just google character name zkill and you’ll get linked to page
---
Lots of no point fits are viable as the fight is over too quick or by the time the pilot realizes they’re melting it’s too late. Doesn’t work every time but quite a bit it does. This is however mainly in regards to Dessie/frig pvp.
---
If the new member doesn't fit with the team, then the new member doesn't fit with the team. Not worth losing 10 guys (to annoyance) to gain 1.
---
Lord\_Maldoror, I saw Rooks and Kings organization page on Star Citizen. Any chance you lot are going to be in that game when it's fully released (Been backing it since the start and they've gotten pretty far). If so, our organization has some similar playstyle to early RnK EvE....and rather elite and expensive capital ships for use when it's all said and done. Would love to see some elite piloting and theorycrafting in that platform!
---
Not POS sticks - force fields. It can't shoot you if it's not online. Also, showing just online ones filters out like 90% of the stick spam.
---
Well thanks. We can discuss with that much than with a statement like: 
---
&gt;Frat having double digit % of bots in eve's ENTIRE HISTORY since 2017. 
---
I don't see a double digit in the FRT-piece, btw.
---
But that aside, this chart is speaking about banned accounts. Not explicitly about bots. It might have been the reason for their ban, in fact that's probably very likely, but we can't tell for sure. We do not know the reason, only CCP does.
---
Also, happy cake day.
---
One could infer that if traffic volume decreased then the actual number of traders(buyers and sellers) would follow a similar trend
---
you can just fill a new blueprint into the text box at the bottom
---
&gt; A link to a website that keeps up-to-date viable PvP/PvE fittings.
---
This doesn't exist. Zkillboard is your best bet, but you want to stick to people who are competent when you get fit ideas - not just randomly going to ship/x/losses. As you get some experience, you start to recognize groups/people who you can trust to fly decent fits.
---
&gt; Recommendation on a fit for Assault Frigates (Any race / except Triglavian).
---
For PvP: https://zkillboard.com/character/95574399/losses/group/324/ - you can find a video on the Jaguar on [his YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1Tls_P_bs4pgqLgOoNV6HQ/videos)
---
(the zkill link is for a dude who does a lot of solo PvP, filtered specifically to Assault Frigate losses)
---
https://www.youtube.com/user/eveiseasy/videos also has a [video on the Wolf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTMwgFlinuA)

Maybe I am retarded then. Cheers

Or 9. Bookmark spam tank, best tank.
---
Check your PM.
---
/s means sarcastic for one.  Which means nerfing the respawn rate of ratting sites had next to zero effect on the corps/alliances that hold lots of systems.  They just travel from one system to other (no lost ratting time).  
---
But for example in HS where there is more competition  over the sites by smaller groups that don’t have the range to travel.  Longer respawn times  affects them more.
---
If CCP gave a shit about your opinion of the event they could have sent out a survey about it.  Oh wait they did, with zero option for constructive criticism.  They make the rules, I play the game.
---
If you checked killboard you will easily figure out the current meta by yourself
---
Deleted outta embarrassment :laffo:
---
Shit. They told me to send the DNA to 24andme. :(
---
My comment was more about that mining does have a lot to do with pvp and hunting.
---
afaik, retribution is the most used AF for small gang. nano kite, beam and with a very light tank.  
---
both matar AF are good also, lots of differents fits.
---
Actually, the way Eve was before is what ran off most of the new players. They're trying to correct a problem that they're too late to fix. Now they're just running off the sperglords that ran off the casuals that make up a sizeable portion of any games playerbase. So yeah, what you're saying does have an element of truth to it.
---
A while back I suggested that drone mining be changed to be more active. Adding more manual mechanics (maybe solving a puzzle, or activating things in order) would force people to multibox less. That way, mineral production overall goes down, but the small groups that dont multibox a lot of rorqs aren't hit
---
Fake.
---
"without brain damage" gave it away.
---
Overview as in the ships and other things on grid.
---
Structures you don't see on your overview you can't dock at, unless you are on grid. If you can dock at all, they'll be on your overview regardless
---
You can offline a POS' force field and leave the weapons online.
---
So I would not bet on everything actually being offlined, even without a force field. I have seen lowsec towers with an MTU beside them, some guns and e-war online and no force field. ;)
---
hahah et Bob tank hull apres les avoir retourné contre le mur! :D

Awesome thank you!

Maulus Navy is a pretty underrated solo boat.

What the fuck does that have to do with the event being shit?  You fucking idiots are like a broken record doing whatever you can to stop actual discussion of this shitty event.  
---
Tell me about all the fun you had with the event after logging in.  How many of the augments is your character using? How much of the lore did you read?  Did you talk about any of this with your friends?  Do you use any of the skins they gave you?  Have you even fit the ships they gave you?  
---
Take your million SP and shove it up your ass.  You sound like the kind of person who see's a van that says "free candy" on the side and jump in the back with your pants already at your ankles.   
---
The event was shit.  Your counterpoint reminds me of all the fucking brain dead idiots who bring up Hillary Clinton every time someone bashes Donald Trump.  They're both fucking garbage, but Trump is president and she is irrelevant.  Stick to the fucking topic.
---
18 generations sure, but it needs to be inbred.
---
Is that the "big" plan or the "ineffable" plan?
---
Well you sounds someone who is way too angry and can't take a joke.
---
You actually believe they didn't do it for the metrics, or do you just not know what the word means?
---
hi sec shipping is generally not worth it. If you do the math it takes thousands of runs to pay for one ganked freighter. Youre better off just ratting.
---
Not that rare once you're an adult with money and friends.....  
---
Tell me more about how excited you got over free bullshit.
---
Its not worth it. You can make more profit with less risk just ratting.
---
dont think this have anything to do whit this, but i logged in to sisi today and notice my pc was starting to lag and checked

KA-KA-KA COMMMBOOOOO

I don't have any experience with t5 sites but if that number or something close to it is consistent, then obviously yes.

After the nerfs I believe that super ratting is around 300m/h but tbh I haven't ratted for quite some time.
---
&gt;Provi is more active now than it was before the PL invasion.
---
Been in Provi for a long time before the invasion.  Came back recently.  While Provi is rebuilding, we are objectively a shadow of the pre-invasion force.  
---
And I agree, as a Provi resident I'd often buy from Amarr, I'd pay a few percent more for items vs Jita to both have fewer jumps, and avoid the Narjia dice-roll.

did you ever speak with newbros? like ever?
---
I am in Brand Newbros, and we got MANY players that DID CATCH UP thanks to the injectors..

I really did like the crimson harvest event.  I liked the rogue drone event.  I have a hard time calling their 20 year anniversary an event.  If that's the little amount of effort they're willing to put in for 20 years, I'm afraid to see how bad 21 will be.  Not gonna stick around long enough to find out, so you two with the ability to actually read and think will have to make a post about it for me.  Too bad it'll probably get lost under the incel circle jerk.

I was referring to NCPL as a whole, not NC as an individiual alliance.  As far as I know NC and PanFam are still best buds. If I am wrong please let me know so I can get some popcorn and prepare for the civil war.
---
If it's the lack of local that keeps you from WH space, then just crash your way into null and explore there. I find I'm usually alone 70% of the time and I know I'm alone because there's noone in local!
---
You really think anyone would mine without a supercap umbrella to protect them? That's not how things work. If it did, nullsec would be full of folks mining all over the map. Sharing sucks. However, this is reality. "Spreading out" doesn't occur. Sure, it'd *reduce* the number of people mining under any given umbrella, but it isn't going to drive conflict.
---
As a guy who did a fair few L4 missions, I got a good chuckle out of that good sir.

Honesty that’s simply not true. The game was continuously climbing in numbers  I remember when ccp devs would log on and say we were almost at a record and cheerlead the players to go for the record. Then for some reason or other ccp decided to start tinkering with core mechanics. Started playing with crime watch and the selling of sp. They added the micro store and alphas.  All of his proved to be counter productive. Maybe there is some trend that we can’t see that made it inevitable that eve was going to lose subs. But it seems awfully coincidental that they very time eve is losing players coincides with their efforts to make Eve softer.
---
Still outnumbered, so, evidently not enough. 
---
And it's nice to see how highly you think of Tau. Pity no one else thinks that. Especially those who know him.
---
Its not an event moron, it was a giveaway. I get that you probably can’t comprehend what that means but it’s free shit for us from them. They released a whole fucking expansion with tons of content. If you’re too retarded to see that they are putting alot of effort in the game and new content then you should just biomass your characters and uninstall because nobody likes you being around shittalking everything.
---
Lawl, not to worry mate I undock a plenty and go out for pew pews otherwise things would get boring WAY to quickly :)
---
Goons improved my boot speed when I joined.
---
I already did
---
Or maybe you've blued everyone and all there is left is a small part of eve as the "rest"... Lol
---
Can't hurt to ask as well, with the exception of when a dick like you comes along.  Then it hurts so bad.
---
Well, apologize for accidentally slapped on your face
---
Thanks for proving my point.  You're making a joke out of actual criticism, trying to derail the conversation.
---
If you do make 2b ISK in a month or two, you will have heaps of in-game goals competing with that Omega for you consider reinvesting into. Your assets will be growing exponentially, but your wallet alone, less so. The players with high end income have put 20b+ into ships and skills (and don't forget time relationship building btw). But they may have never had a wallet balance high enough for PLEX.
---
The bright side of Alpha is that for a few months, you can train 5m SP at zero cost whatsoever. Meanwhile you can learn how to play smart and can gauge your rate of income.
---
Yes  i went there 2 days ago, nothing happened...prolly they werent active or were afraid of my Cyno dunno...
---
You want revenge? There won't be much, there's not much to get revenge ON. Join one of the wormhole corps that's about to have a fucking feeding frenzy in their hole now that it's openly revealed how fuckstupid they are and that they somehow own a c5.
---
Most people involved in this are already irrelevant/already replaced.
---
But what if all the idiots are grr gons?

You're on **reddit**. Chill the fuck out. I've written in the comments my take on events so you can also take that broom that is up your arse.
---
Imagine thinking the metagame isn't garbage.
---
Welcome to bad jspace, it was funnier in the pos days, where I sometimes was able to join a corp on an alt and literally just fly a bowhead into their pos and leave with everything at 3am the same day.
---
"Huh? What happened?"
---
Maybe don't give full sma access to the random 3 day old newbro.
---
I'm not evil, I just hate stupidity.
---
In your character's Activity Tracker, there is an "Exploration" branch. Under that is one that tracks the number of unique regions you've entered. Another one tracks the number of systems that you've entered. J-space counts for more than null.

You wot
---
How do you get that 
---
With what ship and skills
---
Already have a bar in game, bunch of folks in bombers hang there.
---
blame NCPL who have decided to not GET WITH THE TIMES. honestly, i see PH taking over in the next year or two.
---
Do not engage sleeper sites. Only Sansha, Guristas, etc (the pirates).
---
Yes. There are wormholes that go from high-to-high, low-to-low, and low-to-null. If the hole says "null", I jump. One of my goals is to visit all regions to get Navigation 5
---
Hmm I’ve never even seen a pirate site in W-space
---
Why just the mining drones? Something that requires more interaction might help.  Trick is finding the something a human can do without much problem that someone can’t program a bot to do also
---
now this is content m8
---
So posting on reddit validates your circle jerking and attempts to derail any and all conversation about a topic extremely relevant to the subreddit?  Are you paid by CCP or are you just autistic?  If you're autistic then I'm sorry for insulting your escape from reality, but it's in your favor that we're able to hold an actual discussion about the event.

I haven't lived in nullsec in like 2 years but I wonder how it might change the way nullsec works if the industry index in a region reduced the quality of ore spawns but provided bonuses to manufacturing. Would make alliances that do a lot of both have mining regions and industry regions and need to transport materials between them, giving enemies the opportunity to take out their resource chain. I don't think that would significantly affect how smaller groups operate, only big ones. Force the massive alliances to actually use the space they have. (of course this would also mean the way the industry index is raised would need to change, make it more of an intentional thing than "if u mine it goes up")
---
TRI had me mail in fingerprints, eye scans, and a USB drive of me singing all four acts of Carmen after inhaling helium
---
Hélios without cloak ? This is special. But yeah, I suppose this is used to scan down everything in one go, right ? Also, do using RSS probes over SOE really help or nah ?
---
Yes, Resource Wars definitely need wayyy better pay off or otherwise CCP probably better off just delete this part of content
---
Tfw the truckers have more courage than the soldiers
---
Not really.  Was thinking about the event sites.  In High there was a lot of folks going after the same ones. In other places I don’t notice any fighting over them.
---
I wouldn't agree with that, to be honest. Pre-invasion we had practically no capital or supercapital forces to speak off. Even tho people were rushing to train into them during the war, it wasn't until afterwards that we could field them with any confidence. 
---
We can already field close to as many subcaps as we every did during the invasion, and additionally we now have a respectable capital force to back that up.
---
But like I say, we have fewer actually people. Luckily tho most of the members we shed were in the form of 100% pure carebare fat. The same people that didn't turn up to any of the fighting and were essentially useless throughout. 
---
The only people I truly regret losing are Rezeda Regnum.
---
if in am elected there will be nudes available for personal use
---
Wow. Alpha fleet. Didnt heard that for ages now.
---
And pl has even more kills/characters
---
Whats your point?
---
&gt; Anal probes. Anal probes everywhere
---
I read this in a Doug E Doug ranting crazy voice. Now I want to rewatch Eight Legged Freaks for the millionth time.
---
I wanted to touch mining support ships (specifically rorqs and orcas) while not affecting barges. That way, support ships aren't also the ultimate mining ships - currently rorqs and orcas dominate because of their barge-like or multi-barge-like yield with much higher defensive capability
---
I didn't think it was possible to be this retarded.

Imagine being this mad about a login reward
---
The blues won the Stanley Cup last night
---
You might not want to tug on that thread. You blocked those memories for a reason.
---
pretty true , i just had to sit out the ochre test first though.
---
Wouldn't a scarce system benefit someone who does both industry and pvp? Mine a shitload and invade a region for more rocks
---
&gt;Why is that an issue? 
---
Because nobody is gonna suicide there titan fleet to get a bunch of super / titan kills. 
---
&gt; Why should it be cheap and what purpose do supers and titans have?
---
I have been screamed at again and again that carriers and supers are anti-subcap this means they should be anti-sub cap and get killed be caps. 
---
Titans Should in my view be pushed into a more fleet support role.
---
Linux install from Eve University worked great for me. Once I installed Nvidia drivers and updated Wine, I started having graphic issues on launcher. ATM, I'm dealing with the option to start the client is not showing any information, but the option is still there if i wee to click it like its there. Any of you guys experiencing this as well? Working with Fedora 30 btw.
---
Your last thread is 8 hours old and you just make expletive filled rants about how bad daily login rewards are. If you want to vent write a blog and then trash it because no one cares by now.
---
This isn't a complete fit. It only includes the stuff needed to get to 213 scan strength. With sisters your scan strength drops to 208 vs the RSS probes. Tbh i don't even fly it like this i fly mine with 180 scan strength at that point you can ID every single sig except for sleeper caches and the like with maximum of 2 scan passes and 3 for 100% scanned.
---
With 213 strength i imagine you could scan most sigs to 100% in 2 passes.

nope just a poster

thank you for this link haha

Wouldn't that mean test and horde should be much smaller?
---
good change, wish it was done 7 years ago tho
---
&gt;They experimented with offering 10k skill points for your first NPC kill of the day a couple of years ago but I believe that they concluded that it did not notably affect player login numbers and there was quite a strong negative sentiment toward
---
Yea, I kept thinking of that event with the recent outcry against the latest giveaway.
---
IMHO, CCP is a business, and it's reasonable to try to encourage people to play the game, or at least log in, as a requirement to claim otherwise free reward.  But they sure can't do this without outcry.
---
If we have to log in and shoot a few rats, people scream "grrr CCP"
---
If we just have to hit the login screen and skip the rats altogether "grrr CCP"
---
CCP honestly can't really catch a break with this crowd.
---
but he has no hands to transfer the iskies....
---
that's what happens when you have a community of thousands, it's likely that there is at least one idiot in every group
---
&gt; 2.) Allow the SKINs from the LP store to be sold on the market. 
---
Yeah, that would be nice.
---
you can actually drown the cells in your body by drinking that much koolaid, be careful friend
---
Honestly a fun thing would be to place a camera view that lets us see the actual scale of things. There’s a huge lack of scale in-game. Place the camera and let it represent a human’s POV. Easy to do in comparison to creating a functioning walking mechanic.
---
You get to see how huge even a simple frigate is to humans.
---
In my extensive experience, corps where the directors fully trust their members are the easiest ones to ruin. I built my first super with these sorts of betrayals and that was before citadels.
---
WHERE IS THEIR CASINO NOW?!
---
Not much else needs to be said.
---
Then people will just play the blue game outside of eve, just have lists of people you can or can't shoot.
---
If there's a will. There's a way.
---
Ive seen the RW beacons while out and about since patch, but theyre pretty rare.
---
[This](http://evefrigates.blogspot.com/) is great for frigate fits, matchups, strats etc.  He has made solo frigate pvp into a fucking science. Although it only encompasses T1, navy and pirate hulls, not T2. Just thought you should know about it regardless
---
Scam Citizen ---&gt; that way
---
they had to remove features to downgrade the game
---
very cool
---
Amarr is pointless with Jita so close by. 12 jumps and way better prices.
---
Or was losing players the catalyst for changes in gameplay mechanics that people had been complaining about forever(looking at WarDecs)?
---
I wouldn't say Eve has gotten softer so much as CCP has improved gameplay in certain areas that desperately needed it. I think a lot of long-time players like to make the false analogy that the game was dumbed down, made easier, etc. to rationalize the failing of Eve. The sad truth is that nothing lasts forever and IMO a lot of aspects of the game are much improved from what they used to be. There's still some dumb shit that was done(looking at citadel spam and timer mechanics), but overall I think it's a better game than what it was, there's just not that much interest in it anymore. Most people who tried it before and didn't like it aren't likely to try it again and interest in the game among even the more loyal playerbase is dwindling because that's just what happens in games or practically anything in life.
---
Enjoy it while it still lasts because Eve really is kill this time and there's probably not a whole lot anyone can do to avoid the server closure that is certain to happen in the near future.
---
I bet your mom cut the lines she snorted during her pregnancy with that edge
---
If I use an alt and buy something in Jita and then put it up on a courier contract for my alliance shipping service, it'll be in delve (or whatever staging keepstar we happen to be in), very quickly. Contract is completed often just 2-3 hours after I make the contract. If I buy something in Amarr with an alt and then use the same shipping service, it'll take at least a day usually. Unless I can fill a whole jump freighter myself. 
---
I imagine its pretty similar for most other groups as well, Jita is just favored by the freighter pilots so the market has moved towards favoring jita and nullsec staging keepstars for several years now. When I make 100+ units of t2 capital modules I don't even bother sending 5 units to Amarr, because when I have sold all the units I sent to Jita and my alliance keepstar, then the Amarr sell orders for 5 units are still not completely done. Sure I could get a better profit margin on those 5 units but then I'd need another permanent trade alt and its just too much effort that will take away energy from the stuff that brings in the big bucks. 
---
I wager market activity is way up across Eve, in spite of the people in this comment section claiming Amarr is dying because of lower population. Its just that we favor Jita and nullsec hubs over Amarr so much that Amarr is literally evaporating away.
---
praise bob. that's going to take away the constant forums pressure for everyone asking "lemme in plz". i swear 96/100 posts on test server feedback are for that, the rest are "ban dis guy for ganking my super"
---
Can you please post Barl fight. Thx
---
Holy shit lmao
---
Imagine being this mad all the time
---
Under your video settings is the interval set to one or immediate?
---
Immediate will have Eve to run at max FPS (I generally push like 400 fps with it set this way).
---
Since that is incredibly wasteful as your monitor doesn't refresh 400 times per second, setting this to one will cause Eve to limit it's FPS to your monitor refresh rate. This reduces the load on your GPU.
---
You should train yourself into a battlecruiser or battleship then to clear out the rats.
---
Not really cos Goons have more Caps and never take fights they don't have numerical superiority. Besides what is the actual point?
---
Those numbers are no where near the dotlan numbers the Panfam numbers are WAY lower while the GSF are way higher.
---
In some smaller engagements, I've taken to locking the enemy anchor and tossing that Target to the bottom of my screen so I can see their movements, does not work great in large fights where logi lock spots are at a premium
---
And the truth comes out: You are buttmad to the power of infinity because you couldn't get all your rewards from the login event because you are bad at time management.
---
First off, your grammar is terrible, just like your attitude.  Dude just asked for some pointers - he's not asking you to fly the ship for him.  I'm sure you're elite, sweetie, so you should be forgiven for your arrogance.  Let's see that elite kill board of yours...
---
I wrote a guide about [Ninja Gas Mining](https://thegreybill.wordpress.com/2017/02/17/ninja-gas-mining/) a while ago. It also has cringy memes as a bonus.
---
Considering the system is jammed, you've just be caught out in your own low effort lie so well done lad.
---
Anyway if you want to visit its no problem, just hit me up when you plan to drop in, I'll roll out the carpet for you.
---
I love how every hardcore eve geek is against it and copy/pasta the same response they heard from years back. " I nEeD tO mAkE a cOpY pAsTeD mEsSaGe abOuT hoW WiS iS A mAsSiVe wAsTe oF dEv tImE".   
---
CCP sucks as a developer and lacks any talent/skill in terms of software engineering at this point. Any magic they had is long gone. Now it's just a bunch of mediocre programmers trying to keep up and duct tape the mess of code Eve is. All they can do is tweak some numbers here and there and add more art assets to it. It's no surprise that there is a meme going on about "..but, LeGaCy CodE".  
---
Honestly, only reason that after 16 years there isn't any competitor to this exact game is because there is only a small amount of market for this genre and it's all filled with worst of the scum of internet.
---
The CSM doesn't oversee anything, so I guess by watch you mean they watched CCP make changes to the game just like everyone else.
---
depends on how the corp works like in some of these absolutely like it comes down to the vetting process, the point is/was it's not impossible to run a corp like that as long as you keep the people limited but it's never gonna scale aka it rewards smaller groups.
---
Surely there's a way to make small corps viable without making large ones impossible.
---
Cocaine was too expensive, she had to resort to snorting ajax.
---
Well, trying to make yourself a point by being a grammar nazi aren't ya?
---
And second off, after I gave a simple answer for his overly vague question, his reply obviously had an unsatisfied and unpleasant undertone indicated he believed his lazy questions after "6 years of absence" deserves better love, probably some candy, a cup of hot coco and big banner of "welcome back" from others
---
And third off, instead calling me a dick, how about you answer his questions and probably write a detailed essay analyzing current AF meta for all of us? I'd like to see your effort, with all honesty
---
When i came back and i saw this content i almost inadvertently participated in it because i was curious about it. Fortunately CCP put a huge standings barrier in front of it saving me from doing so.
---
I don’t get it how do you make money with industry everything sells for less then you can make it for
---
remove local
---
I totally agree with this. It is a bad mechanic that was meant for new players to get immersed into the game and start working with other people but I believe it will push them away instead.
---
Go where have what fight? 
---
No seriously most day's i have 1/2 hours to have some fun, this used to be plenty to get a decent fight and log off. 
---
Now day's most of the time it isn't so i tend to not bother and that's kinda the core issue.
---
Let's make this a reality
---
I didn't realize I had a point.  I'll try hard to come up with one while we continue to glass those stations you didn't want anyway.
---
The good part is that agents that are not even looking for "bounty" holes will be automatically notified when they find one that matches a customer's specs.  Most of the wh's we find and sell are found when we are looking for something else.  We find suitable wh's very often, the question is whether the wh is already occupied.
---
People would do that? Go on the internet and lie?
---
Risky click of the day
---
&gt; Again the goal isn’t to instantly delete assets.
---
From your own OP:
---
&gt;Enough to be a threat to the caps but won’t kill the supers and titans. 100 titians, 80 supers, 50 fax, 100 dreads, 50 carriers? Congratulations you just lost your entire capital fleet to a bombing run.
---
maybe you should stop playing?
---
I have no stations
---
wait holy shit you actually think I gave myself gold? this isn't a meme? oh my god.
---
EDIT: /u/jibrish can you please c/d this accusation before all of Hordelmeca5hy mud hut village catches this  disease
---
You know you can respond to a post in a single comment and not spread out your replies all over the fucking place.
---
Here's an idea. Burst damage and instantly deleting assets is trash. Try again without relying on burst damage.
---
its my post
---
This is why it's a extreme example yes there are less extreme solutions to encourage small corps but i want defending the notion that it was within CCPs ability to change eve to encourage or force smaller corps without benefiting large ones not the notion that making large corps impossible was a good idea. 
---
Now changes likely have to come more mild then such blanked everyone can steal system.
---
You know, because is a Game and until the Titan bomb, was super fun.
---
"NC and PL are sucking each other off,  like they are known to do! "
---
Now, the real question is how do you scam people with that? Maybe modify the HTML on the voting page to make it look like you voted a certain way? Or just Photoshop...
---
I got thorax but not enough isk to gear it up well. Or tech level to fit good modules
---
They only scanned my colon when I joined.
---
Sounds like my first few fleets. I love the Merlin fleets where we take out ships which are individually worth several times more than our entire fleet. The salt in local is something beautiful to behold.
---
&gt;And now, as a nullsec player - i just want to see highsec burn.
---
Yeah. I definitely understand that. I've been looking at the big null alliances as potential future affiliations. The people of Amygnon are alright but there isn't much excitement in HiSec unless a war fleet shows up to hit the Raitaru like last night or something. Mostly it's just missions and multibox moon mining (alliteration is fun) when an event isn't on. Luckily just two jumps out from LowSec FW space, so if we're bored and no fleet is running, it's easy to find a Comet and get killed by it.
---
Exactly.
---
Eesh. Risk averse or smart? Every time I've seen CVA it's a shitshow of mass loss.
---
f
---
Why do some nullsec corps apparently insist that miners mine out Dark Ochre before anything else?
---
this guy maths.
---
On the advice of Mark Twain, I think I'm going to walk away: “Never argue with an idiot. They will drag you down to their level and beat you with experience.”
---
Outnumbered you say? Don't realy think so. Don't count on us the third parties man.
---
BR show it was realy even in numbers. Still, even without Titans, you outgunned us. The Titan bomb was an overkill, don't think we have any chances to beat you.
---
oh who fucking gives a shit, you guys are why this game is so fucking stagnant
---
Ah yes i forgot it is jammed.
---
I actually might, for fun, just no dread bombs pls . Iknow i.ll die just some good fight would be nice first :) it was my first fight in a carrier btw i did some mistakes but i.d love to try again
---
They only spawn in class 1-3. The entry hole will say ‘unknown space’ not “dangerous” or “deadly”
---
they're generally only in low class w-space, i.e. C1-C2
---
I can't speak for NC. Just my own group within my Corp. None of us care about sov or the invasion. We want pvp and game dynamics that encourage that. The sov system is a joke and I wouldn't run around with a magic wand for anything. If we see a chance to dunk your supers we will take it. That's what most us us care about. I don't hate goons at all and Im not emotionally attached to the narratives that leadership in goons so often refer to. Bob is gone. Old goons is gone. It's just the two strongest entity's having a war. One side is much bigger than the other. What was there to prepare for?
---
Well, you called me a dick at the first place
---
Bailing only means your own defeat
---
I would ask for some help then.
---
This. If someone wants to have that kind of perks they can just rent out systems lol.
---
I have 0 experience so I can't say if they are good, but the [eve university site](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main_Page)  has fits for a lot of ships.
---
This would be accurate if you could wave a magic wand and transmute the rocks into raw ISK. However, reality is more cruel. In order to profit from mining, you generally need to build yourself, or sell to someone who does. This means local industry. While mining itself is fairly mobile, structures are not. Doing clockwise locusting of the galaxy would also mean ripping up structures (and ceding the rigs, the biggest part of the cost) every time the local well went dry. This is to speak nothing of moon miners as well. This is the biggest logistical obstacle to any sort of system that involves migratory gathering.
---
well that's ur fault for quitting... we dont need more stupid casuals like u in this game
---
Never warp blind.  If it's &gt;14au, warp somewhere closer to get within DSCAN range.
---
Even if you can't find a place, as soon as you hit 14au out from warp bubble collapse, collapse scan cone to 5 degrees and start scanning your LZ so you aren't caught completely by surprise when you drop on grid.  Start planning your exfil before you even land.  Better yet, before you've even warped.
---
i think the main reason is that the north is not as interested in carebearing and rented the regions out for the carebears while goons embraced them and made the main focus of their alliance catering to them. and because of the buff to the "farms and fields" gameplay this worked out better for goons. i dont care that goons is the strongest power i the game, however i think its kinda concerning that the biggest alliance in the game is allied with the second biggest alliance so more then half of the nullsec playerbase, and yes more then half of the total playerbase. is under one banner.
---
Like when you could only put so many people into a single corporation, so we just made another one and just set standings?
---
I remember getting angry about it when it came in.
---
I stopped during that first garbage, hipster song.
---
&gt; maybe shoot someone your own size then? 
---
As neither NC. nor PL ever bothered to do this, I don't feel any urge to give such consideration.
---
Im in an alliance thats apart of a big nullsec coalition, imperium. Its really not too different than highsec some days, even safer, just the ratting and moon mining is far more profitable. 
---
However, there is definitely more opportunity to get fights and fleets depending what alliance, or even more specifically, what corp you join. Also, the knowledge of old nullsec vets i find far more useful then highsec vets (although almost all industry focused nullsec vets i know had a long period of being highsec industrialists). 
---
Coalition wide fleets tend to be less exciting because they are huge and frankly imperium rightfully makes everyone retreat (humble request to management to not station ever titan in NC space - i like victory as much as the next guy but i also like eve existing as a game with content), but it is a good experience. 1v1 fights are nearly impossible to get in nullsec frankly, faction warfare space is hands down just the best for solo engagements. In the raw pvp sense faction warfare space is actually far more entertaining then any other place in eve.  However, i love politics, eve history, and narratives, and thats one major draw for me in nullsec
---
On the downlow i really just want to join some of these whaling groups, and roaming small gang groups, that just head through nullsec space like nomadic warrior-gangsters and moon stomp peoples ships in. 
---
In time,  in time...
---
As much as I liked the CQ, the main problem with this idea is that the developers that designed the captains quarters was the World of Darkness team. WoD was cancelled in 2015 and the studio that was working on it, CCP Atlanta, was closed during the restructuring in 2017.
---
So everybody who made the CQ what it was is now gone.
---
Well, yeah.  He's Vastly Outnumbered... always counting!
---
/I'll see myself out...
---
Definitely do not go to any "unsecured", "battery", "forgotten", "spark transmitter" etc sites, meanwhile the pirate faction sites may be rare due to others running them, also if there's one site left in an active wormhole (active structures, dscan activity etc) it might be a bait site. Helps to have a healthy sense of paranoia in wormholes
---
Back when I was new and just started searching for wormhole sites, I nearly died to a site with "unsecured" in its name, because I thought "unsecured" meant not secured *by the bad guys*. Maybe I'm just dumb but I got baited hard.
---
I never thought much of my name until I made something of it. I didn't even choose it for myself, my partner chose it. Now? Wouldn't trade it for anything. :)
---

AMARR SYSTEM IS BEST SYSTEM AND ALWAYS WILL BE.
---
TENLA OF AMARR
---
if you do not call Amarr HOME we don't want you here to begin with, Amarr isn't dying, it's refining it'self and becoming pure.
---
no one said you \*had\* to take sov to live there.
---
Got Full room aggro in a TCRC Incursion site and I heard "all logis, cap and reps on him..."/"FC speaking: pilot(me) overheat your shields"...
---
my shield were off because Outunis drained my capacitor on the first tick...
---
almost lost a 2b ship...
---
I have never pretended that. It was a huge stroke of luck, one that we'd have been insane not to have taken advantage of. And we have absolutely taken full advantage of it, rather than sit around whining that we actually have to undock rorquals like the *common people* in order to do so.
---
I was asking for examples from the list - from the way you speak, I infer that there is a *long* list - of alliances who can achieve anything "productive" in sov null on their own.
---
wasnt that only if you wanted to get in on all the RMT gravy train?
---
What of them? NCPL fought them when they could muster allofEVE to meatshield for their much larger supercap force, but as soon as they had to face enemies on equal terms, they ran like the soft little bitchbois everyone always knew they really were.
---
No one said you *had* to make stupid comments but here we are...
---
I'm glad you're happy, because your future is now being the Imperium's gimp: kept in a little box until we feel like fucking your ass for a while. And then being put back in the box.
---
This comment is like 99% of WH living.
---
If you really think panfam will die from loosing the north you don't know alot about eve
---
Wow I didn't know that. Rip.
---
CCP have explicitly confirmed that's it's legitimate to do this.
---
However as there's no real way to enforce the contract, you might find buyers thin on the ground, and as the number of votes needed to actually get elected is quite large, your vote probably isn't worth enough for you to bother.
---
Meanwhile, I'll offer you 100 ISK to vote for Steve Ronuken.
---
EDIT: I see you have 70 votes. OK now we're talking 7000 ISK!
---
They're level 5 sites right?
---
Kitey retri/ishkur/Wolf is probably your best bet for nullsec solo. I also like brawling in Jaguars. If you want to hit up facwar, brawling becomes an option and the Hawk becomes a big favourite.
---
I've been running that jag for a bit and it's great. Turns out with enough tackle supers apply okay to it though, and okay is way too much.
---
Now show us on the doll where Shoot First touched you...
---
With all this salt I'm going to need another beer!
---
&gt; (Who is super into trump, so their logical thought process is questionable)
---
hmm yes, yes. hmmm yes. \*drinks cum\*
---
It’s only 3.6 roentgens. Not good but not terrible.
---
No one wants them to die, you dunce. The gimp's job is to be the bumbitch, not the corpse.
---
I don't actually recommend dangerzoning gas sites in battlecruisers when you're day tripping. That's just signing up for torpedo delivery.
---
&gt;I'm also a fucking pussy
---
To be honest so was I but exploration can be so insanely lucrative that even if you die 1/2 of the time you'll still be bringing in stacks of cash.
---
And what the numbers come to if you do not add 20 titans? As apparently we only drop them into safe environment.
---
Not disagreeing with the overkill part. It was. 
---
However, 160 in a fleet before the titans vs however many defenders minus the 3rd party (although we rarely see them as 3rd party, the general feeling is as soon as there will be a chance, we will be shot at by everyone)... The numbers do not seem to be that equal.
---
Confirm r/eve goon circlejerk
---
I'm out of the lop - wat?
---
Way back in my baby days as an empire mission runner, I used to hang out in Nakri to run missions for Sarum Family, and did most of my shopping in Amarr.  In those days it was nothing to see 50-60 people in local in Nakri.
---
That whole area is a shadow of it's former self.  There are many high sec areas that are the same.
---
I think there are several factors to blame:
---
1. Players are highly encouraged by CCP  and nulsec entities to move to null space ASAP.   People don't stay in Empire and grind missions and standings and do Empire things anymore when there are people like Horde and Brave that will literally take people in at week 2, with much better PVE opportunities (if your primary focus is isk).
---
2. CCP has been at least somewhat successful in moving industry players out of Empire and into null.
---
3. Lower concurrent logins means everywhere is going to be a least somewhat less active.  Too many issues to list for that, most of you know them already.
---
4. Groups like PIRAT and CODE. have been successful in harassing a large number of casual PVE Empire players out of the game.  Empire ganking and war griefing have been an EVE thing since forever, for good or bad, but starting around 2014-2015 it started to get very organized and became institutionalized.  With the addition of extortion to the mix, Empire has become toxic and my friends list from that area of the game has become a wasteland.
---
Nobody but CCP has any numbers that could be used to add factual basis to any of these, that's just my take after playing for 15 years and watching things develop.  I think it's telling that there's been significant recent developer attention spent on wardec mechanics and now new Empire only PVE content (Triglavian Invasions).
---
It’s less than half as much isk/hr as wormholes, and some people value their time
---
Turn on tactical overlay
---
game is dying
---
uhhhh goons have been operating sigs for a while now bud
---
I've heard this actually drives the art design team nuts.
---
I've been getting this feedback. Sure, f the footage isn't old.
---
Do you even know how wardeccing works now?
---
This is great!
---
Hmm, I would say no. I don't think there was enough ewar, and I'm tempted to ask if there is room for an alpha of mine to help boost the number higher.
---
Just for next time, suggesting a c1-3 wormhole Corp is kinda dumb especially to a new player that has no idea what is good / bad or important ( statics ) for wormholes. C1s are trash if you’re not a miner, c2s can be great, and c3s again are trash, and c4s all depend on static layout to be good or bad. Ideally you wanna suggest a WH Corp with a good static layout as that’s what matters most. If you’re into exploration for example a C4 3-2 would be ideal most likely, but I would consider it a pretty trash hole overall since it limits room to grow especially as a Corp.
---
I was quite sad when I came back and saw it was gone, even if it wasn't particularly useful.
---
But he's standing up for Shoot First?
---
&gt; However as there's no real way to enforce the contract
---
You can give people a specific combination ballot in a way that nobody's gonna vote that combo, add some randoms at the end etc. CCP releases each vote, so the buyer can know whether the arrangement was kept.
---
And then there is the issue of both sides keeping their end but that's an issue for many deals in Eve and third parties can be used.
---
It's unfortunate a CSM seat costs about 1.5 trillion from the numbers I've heard. That's very achievable by some people.
---
We definitely need a 1-person-1-vote system. Whatever bads you can imagine in that system isn't worse than what's happening right now.
---
I am bored with eve right now.
---
Not blind, just stupid. I saw there was a POS there, it just didn't occur to me that it would be turned on, and have a weapon positioned at my exact warp in point. ( I warped in at 100km)
---
This was last year, so active POSes were pretty rare, and this was (and still is) the first time I had seen one active inside Jspace.
---
Just fit for ECCM and trololo at the frustration from the 95% of people that can't scan you down in a safe.  And for the few who can, if they want to risk running around with the virtue implants in their head, they deserve the \~1-3m isk killmail your T1 is worth.
---
Most will realize pretty quick how you're fit and won't bother.  You'll get the occasional dude who wants to hunt you down on principle, but you're likely moved on by the time he calls in a scanner or goes to grab his implants anyway...
---
are u dum dum?
---
Just realized I need to change that... My corp moved a few months ago.
---
Clearly more people need lessons in economics.
---
If there is money to be made selling the product in Amarr, that person will get it to Amarr.  If the price for a haul isnt taken, then they will up the price until it is.
---
Please provide links so that we may be the judge of that, for science.
---
Obligatory banter aside, one of the turbo-autist Goon guys posted a pretty extensive write-up on the political landscape that'll catch you up on the developments of the last few years or so, [here you go](https://pastebin.com/iVjLZDDc)
---
Guess I didn't consume the appropriate amount of coffee to follow comment lines...RIP
---
Can you wardeck a new corp that doesn't have a structure ?
---
Down voted you for a complicated idea which wont solve anything.
---
How about we stop trying to make it Bombers online?
---
They shoot us as well. They we're in cerberus i think. We we're below 200. We had a few more sig on grid, but undergunned. (New bros and so)
---
Anyway, don't get me wrong. It was fun and extreme well executed by you. Hope to many more in The future... But lets skip the Titan part. XD
---
See ya out there.
---
Ah now we can see the violence inherent to the system !
---
Help, help, help ! I'm being ~~repressed~~ abused !
---
Isn't Sort enough for you?!
---
Aside from reworking masses of the game, how would you fix the current meta?
---
Yeah you should try wormholes because you have no idea what you're talking about lol
---
Its been years. Sort out structure spam already:)
---
The destroyable bombs and nerf to bridging... okay
---
nothing , feels bad man. Then the best ive seen personally was about 200m from c3 relic site
---
The people I know who have left have left specifically because their style of game play has been eliminated or driven close to extinction.  If by better you mean it’s easier to figure out - then sure eve is “better” but it has never been more boring. The whole dynamic of the players being the source of the excitement in eve has been chewed away at by ccp. Now your supposed to get your kicks shooting “smart” npc. 
---
And the idea that nothing lasts forever is a cop out. If you sell a quality product for hen people will buy it. People wanted what ccp used to produce - they then changed their focus and now people aren’t buying it.  Eve is a niche game, when ccp embraced the niche it did well when it tries to work against it, it doesn’t.
---
They are anti cap ships... that really don’t do much to caps
---
You know it's funny, people say "terrible" but the character says "horrifying".
---
That's because a Ham Radio is stronger than you probe strength. Train you skills. Use Sisters probes and Launchers.
---
Did I stutter? I said:  
---
&gt; How about we stop trying to make it Bombers online?
---
Haha.... Yeah, that's my biggest risk - Flying stupid.
---
My ramp-back-up period from not playing a few years was painful, this time.  Lost about 600M of ships in the first 10 days.  Oof.
---
allies is a strong word, from what i understand. more like... moderately friendlyish. we shoot each other,a nd have NIPs, and generally dislike ncpl... so sometimes we cooperate, but i don't know id say we're allies. but then, im just a line member, i don't know about the actual backroom dealings.
---
If the price to cover the hauler's risk is 10m isk per jump. And a buyer is only willing to pay 3m isk per jump. Then people simply wont haul (unless they dont know better) and buyers will jump to Jita for their goods.
---
All that will be left are people region trading who haul their own stuff to get more margin.
---
I dont care for the old system, it's gone...let it go.
---
The issues with the new system, and ideas to improve them are more important.  I think the core problems are essentially, there is no reason to respond to Shield Timers and there is also no influence on vulnerability for the Attacker.
---
Maybe something like...
---
* Shield (Defender Determined Vulnerability)
---
   * Services Suspend after Shield (including moon lasers)
---
   * After Shield is depleted, attackers may Entosis for 30 seconds \* ADM, and are then granted the ability to set the Armor Vulnerability.  Will probably need a new type of entosis module, which must be 'wound up' by entosising the target structure when it has shields/durring the bash.  (to prevent easy 3rd party armor timer setting)
---
      * Minimum X Hours per ADM, Y Hours for WH, Z Hours for Low/NPC, XXX Hours for High
---
* Armor (Attacker Determined Vulnerability)
---
   * After Armor is depleted, Riggs are destroyed.  (Yes, defend your shit)
---
* Hull (Reverts to Defender Vulnerability)
---
   * Scheduled out pretty much how timers are schedule now.
---
This system encourages defenders to respond to shield reffing, and to actually set the timers when they are strong.   As well, there is some raiding mechanics for getting through Armor, which can be done easier if defenders do not show up to Shield Timer.   This also combats structure spam and with Rigg destruction moon laser suspension makes Athanors worth attacking.
---
With giving the Attackers better opportunity to hurt their opponents in ways which do not require full super drops and can stratify the umbrella, making small gang defensive fleets more viable.
---
Hey, I have a great idea. Let's take one of the most used ships in the entire game and change it so that it should be used even more to the exclusion of other ships or fleet comps. It will be absolutely amazing and dynamic gameplay.
---
Vastly Outnumbered to Shoot First.
---
LOL.  Your corp history is telling a short story, and/or giving good EVE advice.
---
Will do ,thanks for the suggestion
---
If this was a mechanic in the game, do you really think fcs would drop them all through the same cyno? 
---
The goal isn’t to delete the fleet, the goal is to make them have to split up, and use different tactics. 
---
The only time it would delete entire fleets is if sometime does something dumb. In which case i am fine with them losing it
---
I remember this differently, but good fight anyway
---
I think Manny died to friendly fire actually
---
I've had good luck using holes to get into deep null or low without the hassle.  I had a run of bad luck and got tired of having to sift through sleeper sites to find the pirates in c1-3's, and botting seems to be less of an issue if you pop into deep space.  Or at least I have no issue finding sites.  Dunno if fewer bots bother heading into the boondocks, or if they just get popped too much on the way there to show up.  Maybe I've just been lucky?
---
Hi-sec and bordering low/null systems?  Yeah, fuck that.
---
So titans?
---
I am guessing you have had bad experiences with bombers. I am guessing you are a f1 titan pilot with one of the bigger groups yeah? Why are you so worried about a little extra danger for big ships?
---
Will never be able to stop or detect Virtual Machines though. 16 alpha clients per PC no problem
---
Someone points out that it might be wise to spread the love to a ship not already dominating most fleets and your response is to respond with snark. And you want to be a CSM that takes feedback? Get the fuck out of here.
---
I would love to hear your suggestions actually for how to change up the current meta.
---
Legit, I am ignoring your rudeness
---
I'll pass. Your two prior responses in this thread demonstrated quite well how effective that conversation would be. Good luck with your one way conversation.
---
"Aoe" anticapital bombs would be OP. Even I can see that as a bomber FC. Every new post about them renders the community more allergic to the idea of new bomb/bomber types, while there are in fact much more viable ideas in that vicinity.
---
The one I believe in is heavy bombers with focused damage bombs. Can still be triglavian if people really want.
---
Why do some nullsec groups insist that miners mine Dark Ochre first?
---
Fair enough, thanks for your valuable input and insight
---
Like a true politician
---
What are the viable alternatives aside from nerfing supercap fleets into the floor?
---
VO isn't a bad group, it's just an eclectic one. If you want to do industry, mining, small-gang PvP, and fleet PvP it's great, but only if you enjoy *all* those things. I've had a short hiatus from Eve due to taking exams so I'm not informed on all the details of why my corp moved, but from what I've seen, it appears SF is a lot more PvP focused.
---
well ty then!
---
O_O
---
My god. You just changed my entire worldview. Chaps are assless by default. Meaning pants are just chaps with an ass...
---
You are correct all fights are staged around 30% are my alts and the rest I pay isk for their time and provided the ship I want to fight.
---
it shows
---
I present you the cargo scanner.
---
* Low Sec combat zones that you cannot use capitals based around a new valuable resource.  Ex: grid wide gravity clouds that crush capitals in seconds.  
---
* Battlecruiser sized bombers, non-stealth, that use XL cruise or rapid torp launchers / battleships that can mount capital weapons.  
---
* Split dreads like carriers were split into faxes/carriers. New heavy dread class that gains double rate of fire bonus and tracking penalty so that it only applies well vs. titans or supers, but not any other dreads/carriers/rorquals/freighters. Maybe it also is a niche structure bash ship.
---
The belts respawn only after all the ore has been mined out. If everyone acted selfishly and only went for the quality ore, then nobody would mine the ochre and the belt would never replenish. If you just tell everyone to make sure the ochre is mined out, people will just end their mining session as soon as everything else is gone. So in the interest of fairness, everyone shares the burden of mining out ochre first, in order to ensure the belt replenishes in a timely manner.
---
You can't solve 1000-man titan blobs with a new ship and so on. Whatever ship you implement, the blob will bring twice the amount of it. That problem is bigger than "just make a new ship".
---
The remedy to those blobs is changing the Eve farming ecosystem to demotivate cohesive alliances (groups of people who mainly live in a single region, under a single defense system) from nonselectively growing larger and larger. And redistributing hardcore krabbers of Eve from few condensed regions that they today are in, by bridging the relative safety gap between umbrella regions and other regions.
---
Heavy bombers and focused damage bombs can be useful in that effect. If a fleet of 50 800-million heavy bombers could delete a single capital off field with a well-orchestrated (yet counterable) bombing run that would both be helpful to make the careless titanblobs "bleed" to a balanced degree during sov warfare. And it would immensely help whaling situations when the blob uses umbrella mechanics to protect PvE capitals, which is one way to increase risk in condensed regions.
---
There's basically no way this could be balanced.  They're either so hard to get to work that they're pointless to field, or they're easy enough to get working that it's basically the end of fielding cap fleets.  I really don't see how you get a middleground.
---
And as a sidenote:
---
&gt;You would lose an entire skill level off a random skill if you died in the bomber (yes, this could be Titan 5, BS 5, or CPU management). There would be a cost to using these badly.
---
Mechanics like this in 2019 are dumb beyond comprehension.
---
No, not any more. Now you're only allowed to wardecc corps that have a structure in space. Even better, the wardeccers have to have a structure too, which if destroyed, will end the war. So you can actually fight back. This doesn't apply if it's a mutually-agreed war (e.g. RvB).
---
I think they are great changes - yes if you want to put up a structure you should be able to fight for it. But if you just want to have a corp with 4 mates, there's now no chance of never being able to visit Jita ever again.
---
I'd love to see how quickly you could warp to a specific moon around a planet without a mouse.
---
Yeah so about exactly as I am saying since the beginning
---
I just checked eveiseasy youtube channel and there are many guides all up to date with explanation on how exactly to pilot the ship.
---
Oh, I didn't count the cerberi. On BR they are set as 3rd party.
---
And I agree, would be much better just brawl it out without the drop. See ya next time &lt;3
---
Do NOT fly a Gila in a dark site. You will lose your ship to the timer eventually. Your drones can't hit anything in high level darks and frigs outrun your missiles.
---
For a Gila, exotics are the easiest by a long shot. Followed by electric, then gamma, then firestorm.
---
&gt; Any larger org with a defined enemy had this. In burning POSes owned by competent defenders, this happened most of the time.
---
As someone else already mentioned, there seems to be a difference of experience based upon the size of the entity.
---
Everything in Eve is easier if you throw more people at it.  I'm not sure that alone necessarily makes something a better mechanic though.
---
I like it at first glance.
---
I recently reposted this link, so here it is again:
---
/r/Eve/comments/ayn171/how_do_i_make_money_in_industry/ei22e48/
---
bribe alliance leaders into constant super cap brawls
---
&gt; CCP releases each vote
---
since when?
---
Idk. Last year they did
---
Ah you are back, welcome.
---
1. Don't like that first one, any artificial instanced stuff is stupid imo
---
2. Interesting idea, might work to an extent but how sure how it would be effective against a giga blob. Might be able to alpha a few faxes.
---
3. Another good idea, but not sure how well that would deal with a giga blob.
---
I think it's a good idea. 
---
Also, how do I acces them now, have no idea where to find them in the new agency.
---
Balancing against the fact of one side having more people than the other won't work.
---
Nvm I misread the entire thread, thought you were arguing on the other side.
---
Spodbrain
---
You'd be incorrect. A single inexpensive ssd still hits a few hundred MB/s, which is way more than enough. You could also just throw a few cheap spinning drives in there.
---
so what is your location?
---
i hope dumpsters from your company are not guarded, right?
---
I agree with you about the changing EVE farming ecosystem but I can't see that actually stopping people wanting to be blue and to krab) unless the changes are groundbreaking.
---
Is your third paragraph semi agreeing with me sorta?
---
My killboard was long empty stretches followed by the occasional public fleet or odd POS bash.
---
Warping to dead sticks can occasionally be quite profitable.
---
Triboxing dreads + logi?
---
Absolute madman.
---
We used to call them flycatchers. 
---
Scatter some anchored cans around at warp in points for decloaking as well.
---
Also super useful when you kill a POS to throw one of these down to catch capitals logging back in who logged off in their old POS.
---
ive got my money on blueballs
---
&gt; I warped in at 100km
---
You and half of New Eden. The default longest range isn't all that safe or a range to warp in at.
---
Not to mention... "What is an alt for 500 Alex?"
---
&gt; I can't see that actually stopping people wanting to be blue and to krab
---
So people keep saying this but here is the issue. There is a difference between 50k accounts being in multiple cohesive* corps/alliances blueing each other, and 50k accounts being in a single cohesive corp/alliance/coalition. WWB proved that you can actually break the second kind of entity, turn them against each other, apply pressure one by one, and so on; which still yields a meaningful game. Even if the same 50k alliance now needs to spread activity in 5 regions, each region will have to have their own defense organization and FCs.
---
So I am not arguing CCP can directly split alliances but I am arguing that they can motivate or demotivate human behavior by arranging game mechanics accordingly.
---
(*) (Remember the definition of cohesive: same daily defense infrastructure - which mainly means capital umbrella)
---
&gt; Is your third paragraph semi agreeing with me sorta?
---
I've been arguing for heavy bombers/focused damage bombs for a few years now. They've been in my campaign bid since the beginning. What you're arguing for is a way to delete the entire blob at one go. I find that OP and it's not what I'm going for in my third paragraph. But yes, Eve needs anti-capital ships of sorts. In that way, my third paragraph agrees.
---
If Rita Jita in any of his many, many incarnations actually quit then that would explain it. He was the primary market seeder but iirc got banned, possibly several times, for RMT activities.
---
[Level IV and V](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Sleeper_Cache) and it seems I was wrong with my numbers and it's 104 for the superior and lower for the other two. But generally a higher probe strength is preferred as it makes scanning much faster.
---
Exactly. If we don't want blobs you need to change the structure of the game so blobs aren't the best way to play. Otherwise, people will make blobs, no matter how awful it makes the game to play, people want to win at any cost (even the cost of their fun)
---
Hauling is pvp where you don't get a gun and you're stuck in a barely movable warehouse floating through space. 
---
In pvp with guns, finding targets and shooting them is easy, but not dying is hard. In hauling, same thing, finding contracts and hauling them is easy, but not dying is hard. In both forms of pvp it takes a ton of knowledge, experience and practice to not die. 
---
People should respect hauling as a profession more, even with the guys who just stick to hisec. It's one of the three core facets of industry alongside the miners and the guys who run the build jobs.
---
Since the beginning of the STV system they have. It's not tied to the actual voters, but it is a list of each ballot and how many times it was voted.
---
So yes, entirely possible to track it. _If_ you provide unique ballots for people and track those. 
---
Use the last 3 candidates as your tracker. you'll have 38 (this year) candidates to use in combination. 38*37*36 is 50,616 possibilities.
---
No please stop this. Walking in stations trash
---
Post about a anti Capital bomb take 2 today i .. just team up with the other dude this morning
---
The thing with epic arcs is they're a lot of development time and effort for things that people run once. So I don't disagree, but I guess some cost/benefit bean counters do.
---
At least you can share the 2FA seed between the accounts now. :D
---
Maybe change up how eatting is done in sov. Ie tie mining ie moon output rates in belts belt materials anoms wigs and so on to other regions ie eatting in one region effect another so to have useable eatting mining and such you have to attack people in other regions.
---
We'd game that by owning a constellation in every region.
---
Who needs secure accounts anyways?
---
Man I hope nobody steals my 3 mil ISK on SiSi
---
&gt; look what the new war Dec mechanics have done every merc group in eve that have fought each other for years
---
If they want to fight each other then they still can. All the wardec changes have done is prevent them from deccing corps without a structure, and getting cheap kills from newbs who don't know better on trade hubs.
---
It's the primary hub for most of the stuff Brave needs.
---
"Conflict" these days is usually some dude who multiboxes a bunch of stealth bombers driving around and killing off excavators.
---
Like is broken I would like to read can you try to repost
---
&lt;3 have fun out there bud
---
Why'd you ping Big Bill to show your unwavering reddit support?
---
&gt; economic theory would say that if the gains from selling outside Jita were significantly higher then they'd be capitalised on
---
Economic theory assumes perfectly rational trading and puts basically no value on convenience. Given that this is a game, that's even less valid than it is in RL markets. Essentially, there are opportunities in Eve markets because people can't be bothered to do that work.
---
&gt; Since the beginning of the STV system they have. It's not tied to the actual voters, but it is a list of each ballot and how many times it was voted.
---
Rly? Where is this information?
---
When CCP does things you don’t like, the CSM has no power.
---
When CCP does things you do like, it was all the CSM.
---
That's what got her blown up.
---
The rate of JJBA references will skyrocket.
---
*Jotaro, are you trying to get closer to me?*
---
Hurf blurf.
---
Oh my god can we please stop trying to get more burst damage into the game? Jesus christ
---
Too lazy to fire up pyfa but I thought I remembered that 2x gravity capacitor upgrade I is better than 1x GCU II. Am I wrong?
---
&gt; Scan Rangefinding Array II
---
Short for "get gud n00b"
---
&gt; Mid-grade Virtue Omega
---
Short for "stop being poor"
---
The problem and solution are wrapped up in one fact:  
---
If people are going to go hunting with 100-200 people in a fleet and hot drop/bomb/whatever... then you are going to see people organize into social and defensive structures able to resist that.
---
Your changes aren't "groundbreaking." it's just a shitty version of "delete capitals". Burst damage is trash and ideas like your's are also trash.

bye frt was nice knowing you

 Stealthbombers are fun though :)

I like the basic concept of this idea, except i believe the ships should have a proprietary cloaking system with a hard limit on cloak duration with a cooldown time added, BS sized hull with low damage resist profile, and the bombs in question should have a very small radius of effect negating their ability to damage multiple ships effectively
---
You have a point there
---
Virtues aren't expensive if you do explo. And diminishing returns means that with 3 arrays and a grav capacitor the 2 T1 grav capacitors are the same as the 1 T2 but leave room for some other rig.

I do. That's part of the experience.

I've been thinking about using one of my Career Training destroyers for mining, but in the process I've discovered that the CPU requirements for a full complement of mining lasers are ludicrous and I'm having trouble raising my CPU cap. How many different ways are there to do this?
---
(Obligatory INB4 ORE ship line: I'm currently Alpha, so I want to outfit an Alpha-capable ship to outmine a Venture with the help of an MTU so that in the future if I go Omega but have to let it lapse for a bit I can still do pretty well for myself mining)

Depends, making stuff more hands-on, like abyssals/carrier ratting vs vni-ratting don't hurt the single/dualbox players.

That's true, but it would force more movement of materials, giving more opportunities to hunters for PVP, and require assets to be spread out over a greater volume of space to operate efficiently as a large industry corp, as a contrast to everything being done in the same system with near-zero risk

I used to be like this, then I joined a WH alliance a few years back...now I'm the opposite: on the rare occasion I can log in - I prowl hisec looking for low class wormholes to take my Strats or T3s hunting for spod-brains at their moon mines...so much spooky fun.

As others have mentioned, the loot is way better in WHs - just make that warpable on-grid ping and you're safe...ish!

See you there

like i said some people dont know better. or maybe they just like hauling.

I have no sympathy for trade hub campers or griefers. Those are the ones I hear complain the loudest about recent changes and how their gameplay style has gone extinct.

---
No real need to be rude, but I take your criticism
---
Do I just need clock 1 or I need to do covert ops too?
---
Not bad idea on the cloak, make them "have" to be used fairly quickly. Also like the idea of making them massive BS sized as well.
---
I'm literally just standing in Detorid right now, dont know what he means
---
NS ratting is generally 60m/hr or lower.  
---
In a wormhole, the two general holes you want to be ratting in (C3 and C5's) you would be expecting 150m/hr in the low end. Highest I've made was chaining C3 relic/data sites at 250m/hr.  
---
Mining gas in C5/6 sites is 100-150m/hr per character ( but they run out fast if many people come ) Wormholes are the way to make isk if you cba to run incursions. One thing just to keep in mind with wormholes is it's burst isk. You will have nothing for a bit, and then you decide to roll your C5 for sites. Maybe it takes 2-3 rolls to find a good one you can rat in, sometimes more.  
---
Wormhole space is a lot more opportunistic, as you don't really know what will be on the other side of a fresh hole. Maybe you are looking for a good krab hole and you run into a couple rattles doing a site, easy content.

At least some veteran players realize some of the issues plaguing Eve aren't all CCPs fault and that maybe, just maybe, something else sucks around here, to quote George Carlin.

You got that arsey-varsey.  DBA is the one that says "no".  Devs just whinge a lot.
---
This guy is totally not in wangspin

...yes, and if they're serious about the game's environment those sigs will go out and DO stuff that create content. Last time I got fights off a reaver deployment was like 2015.

I would like to be able to juice corpses and make drugs from the juice, CCPls.

Hope you bookmarked it and reported it in intel channel.

Belts won't respawn until all the rocks are gone, so I believe that's intended to make the less desirable ores go first, guaranteeing the belts will respawn when the juicy stuff is depleted.

---
I've been in some capacity significantly involved in every newbie corp in eve right now and frankly, I'd suggest Karmafleet or Brand Newbros over Horde, and especially over Brave. Brave has been a mess for a while, and I can't respect Horde since 2016, sorry.
---
I agree with your wh suggestions, Pos Party's a good group that's been around a long time and treat newbros really well.
---
Aideron Robotics is a mess right now. Frankly if you want to get into facwar, TARD or there's a lot of pirate corps out there looking, FRESH is pretty good right now.
---
PvP and exploration? Brand Newbros until you can get vouched into Dreddit, tbh. Karmafleet isn't too bad, or get into wormhole space. Einstein-Rosen Brigade is a very friendly newbro oriented WH group run by a respected adversary of mine. /u/emmalinefera get in here hon.

Because Mittens is attacking NC., not PH?

Yes, TEST will fill it up with hardworking 23/7 miners.
---
But PH is supporting NC, and gobbins is a big celeb
---
Weird flex but ok
---
No idea about how bots work, but it wouldn't matter for covert sites because those despawn a couple minutes after someone warps in, so you wouldn't find a half run site anyway.
---
&gt; You sound like the kind of person who see's a van that says "free candy" on the side and jump in the back with your pants already at your ankles.
---
OK, I loled. You're being a twat. But this was funny.
---
hehe shit happens
---
ok, now here how balance kicks in, each stealth bomber of these, costs 10b. If you want a 100-200m frigatex10 to counter trillions of ships you are out of your mind, cost is a balancing factor, supers are op but cost 10x anything else, look at machs and how they nerfed them by lowering the bpc drop rate.

---
&gt; Sure, it'd reduce the number of people mining under any given umbrella, but it isn't going to drive conflict.
---
While you’re not wrong, I think this more points to how the existing system supports (if not encourages) maximizing player concentration in a smaller area. 
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
For example if the system worked the opposite way, where heavier and heavier concentration had diminishing returns on an individual level, you might very likely see more individuals willing to take on a little more risk to find somewhere that is untouched or underused. 
---
&amp;nbdp;
---
Also, while Mining activity might go down, that rings true for any added risk or difficulty. There might be evidence to say that the increased reward and safety surrounding rorquals is the reason Mining has gone up in the first place (assuming it has).
---
I’ll watch these when I get home from work and provide feedback. I’m a really new player, maybe newer than your videos are aimed at. Only been playing a few days.

I’m more interested in learning about PVE but I’ll still check these out

---
I've been tooting the heavy bomber horn for years. Something akin to a B-52. Maybe a battlecruiser that can't cloak but can field more than one bomb launcher.
---
So a dread that can fly around the grid while sieged, and bridges instead of jumps?
---
Just so you can say 'we dont fly caps'?
---
Covert ops cloak combined with a T2 covert ops ship (or an Astero) vastly increases your survivability in w-space, but costs quite a bit more than a T1 scanning ship. I think the trade-off is almost always worth it to go to a T2 covops, but if you're new I would advise you *against* the Astero. It's a lot of isk and most of the things you'll be dying to right now are things that you don't expect and don't know how to deal with. An Astero won't save you from that.

Which side?  Is it the invasion fleet, defensive fleet, or evac fleet? etc.

EVE has way too much unfinished content, though. The devs need to stop trying to add more and more content that they're never going to finish and start working on updating and fleshing out the old content they never finished.

So if its so profitable, you go do it.

People give gold for all kinds of dumb reasons. Gold had it's price reduced and you can give it to folks for free if you get gold yourself. So, platinum is the new gold.
---
I assume you didn't fit a cloak because you're Alpha.  
---
If you're going to use WCS instead of dying like a real capsuleer, then you might as well go for 4 WCS or add an agility module. Anyone going after explorers is going to have a three point faction scram or plan to alpha you. The amount of tank you get for the DC without any additional buffer is incredibly low; you'd still die to a smartbomb or artillery salvo with the DC, so you might as well focus on being slippery.  
---
I wouldn't bother with either the laser or the drones - they're doing nothing for you in a dirty-low-down-lily-livered-scavenger WCS fit. You can't really fight anyway, so you'd be better off fitting a salvager in the high, so you can opportunistically salvage (particularly relevant with the Triglavian invasions, where you can make solid ISK salvaging the ships others kill).  
---
Someday, I hope they nerf WCS so they can only be fit on haulers, but even if they don't, you'd be doing yourself a favor (and preserving a shred of human decency) if  you ditched the cheese modules and went for 2x Nanofiber and 2x Inertial Stabilizers in the low slots in order to focus on being fast and slippery. You'll have more fun flying (faster, and won't have the targeting delay from WCS), and learn more about situational awareness and piloting. That will increase your fun ratio, and also benefit you more in the long run than just hoping you have 1 more WCS than your hunter has points.
---
But its real this time!!!

Can you guys just cut it out with the Casino Wars?

Magnates are cheap. Buy and fit a bunch with just what you need to do scanning and hacking. Replace when you loose it. Even a couple of lucky data sites in high sec is enough isk to replace one.
---
Bruh the exact same thing happened to me like the day they announced they were going to start phasing out POSes...
---
&gt;cost is a balancing factor
---
No. No it is not. No it *absolutely* is not. High cost does not stop things from being fielded in large numbers. CCP expected to cost-balance Titans and Supers. Now look at the state of the game.

One item that I thought should go into the lp store was the named damage mods they gave out a couple of years ago. Those have the name of the npc fleet commanders that give you the info when you first get to a site so it fits very well with the theme. They should have included them in the ship packages rather than the t1 versions that are there now. I doubt it would have done much to the value but it would have made it more interesting.

Everybody complains about everybody’s else’s game play style. The bottom line is that for most of eve’s existence the challenge in playing the game didn’t come from ccp and the npc, rather the challenge was the other players. Any pve that was in the game fueled pvp.  So choke off the pvp in game in high sec and what are you left with? Boring repetitive pve that people rapidly burn out on. Evaluate it is no fun. Moreover, all the new players start in highsec, so without he possibility of pvp thy are left with the pve as being representative of eve. They never get to see eve at its best - instead they see just the pve. Ccp has being trying to change his by making their pve more dynamic, but let’s get real it still sucks in comparison to fighting other players. It’s no wonder I can’t retain new players because ccp created a situation where new players only see the worst parts of the game while it’s best bits are kept from them.

I am NOT saying that something that costs a lot should WIN every battle or even half of them, i am saying that you can have 10 200m frigs nuke a fleet of titans with 10 bombs. Im actually saying the opposite of what you assume, something THAT powerful, should cost a lot, you are taking off on your own talking about stuff that i didnt. Again if something is fucking op and broken (see bosons) it should cost a shitton.

I'm honestly not sure exactly what happened. One of the bombers died to their own bombs. I think two got away. The rest died. I got down to 77% shields. They didn't come back.
---
We carried on mining hoping some more of the feroxes might come back to play :D 
---
This was fun. I don't usually mine, but have an alt who can, we didn't quite finish off the R64 rocks, we had a strat op starting to form when there were a couple of roids left. Our isk/hr wasn't particularly great, obviously we spent as much time killing feroxes as we did mining, but we didn't do it for the isk, about half the fleet donated their ore to the srp fund afaik. TRC pretty much called a CTA last night to mine this moon and run a protection fleet for the miners, precisely so that we couldn't come and mine it out from under their noses in EUTZ *again.* 
---
That's why this was really fun.
---
Great work to the USTZ dudes who stopped that mining CTA from doing it's work last night btw. Who'd have thougth mining could actually be enjoyable?

Again, cost does not function effectively as a balancing factor. A ship needs to be balanced on its own, assuming it will be balanced by the community not fielding it as much due to cost is not going to make it balanced.

You don’t seem to like the Venture that much, so I’ll go with it.
---
While the eight turrets destroyers might sound interesting as miners, they are also made with tight fitting room and limited slot layouts so that they can fit a cruiser sized tank while being able to fire eight bonused light turrets. This also apply to the mining destroyer, and there’s not a lot you can do about it because of the limited slot layout.
---
The only ship that isn’t in the ORE tech tree that can be effectively turned into a miner is the Rokh battleship. You get the same eight turret hardpoints, but a way bigger fitting room to get more MLU fitted, and a decent tank to repel lonely gankers. However, you’d still get a limited cargo, which mean frequent runs to a station or friendly Upwell structures are forced. And with the agility of a battleship... it’ll be a pain in the ass.
---
To be honest, mining isn’t the best career choice as an Alpha, because of all the limitations you get. I started as a Venture pilot, and the role bonus (plus the levels you can train in Mining Frigate as an Alpha) are generally enough to outclass every other ship outside of the ORE tree, with the exception of that very specialized Rokh that is still awkward to use. If you want to be a miner, good. But the Venture should be your best friend as a beginner, Alpha or not.
---
And as a last note : Omega is just 15€/month. I know this jump can be as scary as roaming nullsec for the first time, but boy how you’ll be happy once you do it. Get a barge, munch those rocks, and get out of the safety of highsec havens to enjoy the game :)

If you have good salt then post it here.
---
Lol, a wormholer with ethics?  Ridiculous...
---
My, how the mighty have fallen.
---
Running a freighter with a webber is super fun to be honest. My best setup was a max-skilled huggin with 3x faction webs supporting a freighter with an ascendancy-implant pilot. 
---
Usually the freighter would complete the jump and have to wait in gate-cloak for the combat timer on my webber to go away, so I was taking about 60-80 seconds per system. That's basically twice as fast as your typical freighter, and vastly more safe. 
---
To be fair, somebody once scammed me for about 10b in a freighter contract scam, because I didn't consider that if somebody suicide-scrams your freighter and then bumps you while you're scrammed, then you're kinda screwed. 
---
I learned though.
---
If you wish upon a star...
---
Everyone here will tell you low sec is dead. They are pretty much wrong. A few of my friends have recently come back to the game and we’ve been roaming around black rise and other cal/gal fw space getting good fights every time we roam. We usually run 3-8 man gangs and have had some really good luck.
---
A gold star and a participation trophy.
---
Highsec PvP has always sucked because of the mechanics around it. That's why people make fun of Highsec "PvP" groups. It's less about competitive gameplay and more about ganking clueless nOObs. The joke being that Highsec PvPers are so bad at PvP that they can only kill clueless nOObs. 
---
Now the game is running out of nOObs and CCP wants to at least make it harder to grief new players so that they can get in the game and get a good foothold without being constantly harassed by the douchebags that those type of players normally are. Makes sense to me if you're trying to keep your game alive. Don't let your new players be able to be easily griefed by douchebags. I think most successful games do that to some degree
---
Rip another pvp alliance, gj fozzie!!!
---
\&gt;Target is too far to lock, you must be within 133km
---
\&gt;**ON MY OVERVIEW** target is 88km away
---
Very cool!
---
WHY ARE YOU SCREAMING ?
---
I've never been to the dronelands. I'd love to fly there sometime but I don't speak Russian.
---
CCP needs to get Simon Viklund to do their music.
---
I, too, like to shit on people for something inconsequential when I have nothing meaningful to contribute.
---
Gives a kind of wire service/ teletype feel to it, no?  I dig it.
---
Skill was the best alliance I have ever been in, and I have been in a couple in the 15 years I have played the game. Sadly, the game just isn't at a state where we can enjoy it how we want to anymore. I will miss playing with Skill more than the game itself.
---
Luckily, I get to go out with a bunch of other like-minded toxic individuals.
---
Dual-Prop should have a hat-tip or mention to MJD's as it is a type of propulsion, and has plenty of application as your 'Second Prop' method.  
---
Also mention why range-control is important after you enter scram range, what weapon systems are good to pair with a dual prop layout, and what ships are viable, perhaps as this is a tutorial, have a beginner - medium - advanced ship to try the style with.
---
Tactical Overlay!
---
Trans-Vel video is decent! I'd have added in the opposite-side of the story. How to 'track' or minimise your transversial to smaller targets to hit them with larger guns (tactical overlay, matching velocities &amp; manual piloting) nothing quite brings joy to my heart like hitting a perfect hit on a fast mover with an Oracle as you OH your MWD to get that speed matched just right. 
---
Really good first videos :) thank you for your time and effort

Nullsec SOV life in the dedest region in the game is boring? Who would have thought.
---
Don´t feel sorry, they went to it willingly knowing how AIDS null life was.
---
This. Also, some groups like The Initiative have added Mercoxit to the Dark Ochre rule, because it generally also with the ores left behind, as you can’t mine it with a Rorqual’s excavators, and it require special fit and some light skill training to mine, since it can only be done with "Deep Core" mining lasers, which are way less useful for mining anything else than Mercoxit.
---
Also, Mercoxit asteroids are subject to a unique mechanic : they can sometime spew out a damage cloud about 5km in radius if they’re being mined by a ship whose pilot doesn’t have Deep Core Mining V. It force the barge or exhumer to sit outside of that range, which can be awkward if a nearby (Capital) Command Industrial Ship isn’t properly placed, and outside of the Porpoise, the Orca and the Rorqual are a pain in the ass to reposition.

2) Pussy renters who will krab all day and cuck to the demands of their overlords.

If you want fun and engaging content, move to wormholes. "Wumhulls urr derd" is just a meme spread by people who don't understand that you actually have to go and *find* content in wormholes (\*gasp\* *effort!*).

liquidate all of your assets and spend the isk on spiced wine and exotic dancers, male. Load them up into a hauler and abandon it in some backwater wormhole to bamboozle future generations.

&gt;NC JACKDAWS LANDING ON GRID
---
he wasn't even allowed to run. I guess building a platform on being anti-bot and then joining the premier botter/RMT alliance in the game to have them provide all your ship replacement looked suspect.
---
I will always respect you and skillu.  I appreciate what you brought to eve and the game.  I hope you come back at some point.  I also hope you enjoy the games you play in the future with your bros.  I'm unironically sad to see this post get made.
---
NC. is about to become a pretty dominate lowsec group, should check them out.
---
Umm, yeah. Basically.
---
Although It's ProviBloc, not just CVA. I know it's hard to remember all these details, but there is more than one alliance in the coalition.
---
lowsec is grim... i try to find solo fights in amarr/minmatar zones that i maybe could win... takes 30 minutes till i give up without any kill... but then i only want to do this in tech 1 meta 0 normal frigates and dont upgrade to worms, garmurs, kikis or whatother stuff... 
---
there are like 3 systems with content, thats amamake, kourmonen and kamela, rest is mostly empty and dead, maybe you find a farmer with stabs or venture... 
---
amamake dscan looks like this:
---
worm
---
dramiel
---
garmur
---
machariel
---
kikimora
---
mostly in pvp everyone will run away, unless they are 100% sure they win... and the rate of bots and stabbed people is extremly high and with so many dead systems its very easy to find large plex where those stablords still can make their isk... 
---
if in any way, do it with a group, dont do it solo, its absolutly not worth the wasted time
---
No, it has just started.
---
TRC have been really graceful hosts, over the last week or two they've let us mine all the R64 goo on most of their moons - They insist they don't need it and can function without it but im not sure how true that is considering they're pinging like crazy for USTZ mining ops.
---
11/10 fleet. Would mine TRC salt again.
---
You've had quite the run, gg wp.
---
bye
---
It was a good alliance. I honestly don't know what most people see in this game if they aren't doing cool shit outnumbered with over double the amount of people in fleet than comms. Everything else is mindnumbing.
---
Drone lands isn't a pvp mecha... news at 11 ha
---
yeah nerf the garbage ship pls
---
Everyone is either eq's or Yankee's alt. Evan is both.
---
Good to see that bitter ex syndrome is alive and well in tyool 2019
---
you know if you don't actually defend test will actually pass?
---
Agreed, I also used to run missions in Nakri way back in the day, there were tons of people in that system, but now its shell of its former self.
---
I mean, at least they found the undock button this time.

Skillu was a proper pvp alliance, thanks for the fun amigo.

It is possible you can do T4 Gammas with it, though my personal suggestion is to have a packrat in the cargo and switch the tractor beam to a nos, it can really save the bacon on rooms with heavy neuts with a drifter battleship or 4+ vedmaks. 
---
You might have issues with clear times however as that relay in the low slot does limit your dps a bit, and with my Gila I cleared the site with 2-4 minutes to spare on average.
---
But with the pack rat, pop the cans, get within 20k of the gate and deploy the mtu and let it work while you focus on the rats.
---
is this "Joke of the day " ?
---
BORING! DROP SOMETHING!
---
Buff only the bombs single type resistance to 100%: then have the defender do omni damage.
---
**F**
---
GL to those still in doubt we haven't reached Serenity yet.
---
can i have all their stuff?
---
We are in a fight right now.. 2300 in local. Game is the best its ever been. Roving bands of sov-less "elite" groups are dying a slow death.
---
One could say they are Skilling themselves (ingame)
---
"Lets kick out all of our local content and wonder why our space is boring"
---
*mecca
---
yep damp their range till they can't lock the griffins and just sit there with the griffins and make them hate life.
---
Its not always torpedoes, it could be a drone party or high speed rail service as well. I forget what other things they include on the list of their available "services" from the last "delivery confirmation" i recieved.
---
It was fun while it lasted ty
---
Best bunch ever. See you on the other side bros. I will never forget Delve.

Pretty sure the bots speak binary.

Is this what Provi FCs have to post about these days? I keep thinking Provi is at the pinnacle of shitty coalitions, and they always seem to prove there is more. Good Job provi Bloc, you half-ass mined a moon and lost excavators. You should make a Reddit post about your new found riches. Ohh waaaiiiiiiii.....
---
that was absolutely shit you retard , yup i sure enjoyed playing the game eve online with 3000 of my best buds on a dying server
---
&gt; what fit would be better
---
Prior to a very unfortunate disconnect, this was my Gila and it ran all t4s except darks effortlessly. You can debling to flavor. https://zkillboard.com/kill/77235964/
---
&gt; Second thing, what kind of lvl 4 sites are the best to run?
---
In a Gila, Exotics. Your scourge missiles will shred. In order of difficulty for a Gila - Exotic &gt;&gt;&gt; Electrical &gt; Gamma &gt;&gt; Firestorm &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Dark. Just don't do t4 darks in a Gila. Your drones can't hit anything and stuff outruns your missiles. You'll die to the timer, even with bling.
---
&gt; And how do you exactly run them?
---
Get the main box and the wall boxes if I'm ahead on time. Don't worry about wrecks.
---
&gt; What things can suddenly kill you/ruin your run on lvl 4 sites besides timer?
---
Learn which things neut. This is the fastest way to die. If you get 5 neuting Leshaks or a handful of neuting Vedmaks, you'll be in trouble if you don't clear them fast.
---
The Blue croissant is just too big. :/
---
Narrator: They passed.
---
What were their style of gameplay ?
---
&gt;  one would hope things like this would be a wakeup call for CCP, but it's unlikely

P.S.I will never forget your autist ops doing 60+ events in Insmother on Christmas '18
---
Oï !
---
While it’s true that higher tiers give higher rewards, you’ll just chain lose your ships by going there unprepared. I recommend starting with T2, discovering the mechanics and making your own opinion on them, and then jump in T4. But, that’s up to you.
---
I’ve been using this fit for T4 Electricals, Gammas is and Exotics. As a new player, you should try to do some Gammas, as the shield HP bonus help you if you make some mistakes that would normally get your tank blowed to nothing, but don’t stick around those too much.

Wrong.

dont you think its bad that the game is choking out all but 1 play style?

We are a small group of pirates that have fun doing mostly solo and some small gang PVP. No rules for the most part, no CTAs for the most part (if there is one, it's actually optional), no killboard shaming (a fun fight is a good fight, no matter if you win or lose), no mandatory bullshit.

Just log in, do whatever the fuck you want and have fun!

Can someone explain why Muninns and Eagles are good compared to the other T2 carriers?
---
Yeah got rekt hard today on my venture. Lost 4m of equipment (my gas harvesters)
---
hey, at the time i was on grid with TEST, all i saw were NC Jackdaws. then like 2-3 minutes later i see their scimi/muninn fleet lol
---
If nullseccers wanted to sabotage good anti-capital bomber ideas with filling the subreddit with terrible ideas, they would make a post like yours.
---
&gt; same effect 
---
We are trying to figure out ways to deal with the capital menace.
---
You are giving people means to delete any subcap fleet. And you're removing the need of using elaborate orchestrated waves too.
---
Defo not the same effect.
---
Bonus salt to add to the reset of my pile.
---
who cares if idiot pvpers quit the game, all they do is scare off the real rorqual warriors &gt;:(
---
i'm glad i'm not the only one who can't stand the sound of my own voice :)
---
Sad to see you guys calling it in, would've like to see you continue on, may you enjoy your time in the future and come back stronger than ever
---
Or how to one shot every subcapital fleet with a wing of bombers by literally transforming a weapon that need way more positioning and some shitty stuff like pointing your weak bomber at 0 transversal toward your target and going full speed, and transforming it in the regular F1 monkey toy.
---
It’s a big no. Go away.
---
I LIKE WAFFLES. DO YOU?
---
What renters do you know of in lowsec? Wtf?
---
The end of the beginning is beginning to end.
---
People who enjoy that play style don't care if it is.
---
Lowsec is fairly healthy in the FW zones. Outside of those it is very quiet for the most part. 
---
There's several good FW groups in both zones, there are also several pirate and neutral corps and groups. 
---
If you are in EU TZ and a decent pvp pilot; (gotta plug our corp somewhere, right?)
---
[Mea Culpa.](https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98592854/) is a fairly young EUTZ lowsec corp formed by a few buddies who enjoy killmails and relaxed comms. We're small gangers at heart but also take part in larger drops with our new alliance buddies. As of last month, we're proud members of Shoot First which adds a nice little extra to our content portfolio and a couple benefits, too.
---
We're based in Sinq Laison, super close to the southern warzone. That means content is literally at our doorstep and we harvest it every day. We fly everything from T1 frigates to T2 battleships, caps and often somewhat unusual fits. We don't really care about ISK efficiency or other metrics of eliteness. So if you want to roam your 4b Marauder, that's more than fine. If you can and want to fly blops that's also very welcome.
---
I feel like a vague acquaintance at a family funeral for a loved one. I got in at the tailend, when it was truly winding down, when we were hunkered down in Drones, took Insmother and waited for something, anything to happen. It didn't. Some of the most selfless, best content creators in the game saw the writing on the wall. The game isn't getting fixed. Best to go out now than rot and end up hating each other. Thanks for taking me in.

Ha ha you think your tough mr wormholer . . . But you can enjoy me camping your wormhole with my titan if you think that fun

---
Stop firing half the developers every 6 months is a good start.
---
You obviously have absolutely 0 clue about the mechanics at work.
---
its for the best leaving characters only leaves the motivation to maybe play
---
Cuz it's not a war its a purge. I'm here to take your candy, knock over your sand castle and ruin your vacation pics with my bloated barely covered physique.
---
I defended it for 2.5hrs, hazing jackdaws with only 4 duders to help with defense against 40 of you. Still took you to eutz to actually do something productive with it. More sad than anything, but you do you I guess :)
---
Drone lands wasn't the problem, thanks to the new jbs we could move from one end of the map to the other in like 15 mins. The shit state of the game is, however. It just isn't worth the effort anymore.

? ? ?

you role into my region . . . i cyno onto ur wormhole . . . if u come through i ignite boson and kill ur noob ass
---
verey easy
---
It's time cephei
---
Make a new recon cruiser with a new bomb high slot for "Heavy Bombs." These bombs would have a an explosive radius much too high to make them effective against only caps. 100% damage resists and do roughly 20,000 damage to a specific damage type. Only things within this blast radius with a sigradius of 7000 or more would take full damage. Even smaller would work. Maybe the same as an XL torpedo. Having a damage radius of 20 k? This would make it completely harmless even to frigates through battleships.
---
What pvp are you looking for? Don't get me wrong I think ccp is doing a dogshit job fixing their game to keep players interested. Always interesting to hear what an alliance dies to / lack of though.
---
Can confirm. Have been hit.
---
p3ak try the hardest of anyone to enjoy this shit game. CCP killed us
---
oh yeah, blue is just a colour, NBSI rules, grr stupid role players
---
^&lt;3
---
I mean if its true sorry to see you guys go. Anytime groups leave or dissolve its a loss for the game.
---
Don´t give a shit about you and your trash posting.
---
Have fun cynoing on a hole and camping there with a titan.
---
Are you on the 64 bit client? I notice it had a higher usage on in my task manager than before I switched to it.
---
You CAN solo in a Magus, but honestly, you'd be better off in a Tristan or a Vexor. The Magus really shines as a fleet support ship with the links and boosher.
---
ha ha i dont need to have fun . . . I enjoy my rorqual alt while i wait for ur death
---
Interesting.  For those who want context on the region and geography here; this solar system is adjacent to the 9uy capital (keepstar staging) for cva in which cva lost control last year some time and haven't been able to retake. TRC (The Rogue Consortium) is a predominantly new player alliance comprised of many players that left provi bloc for various reasons as well as people new to the game that has worked with my alliance to play keep away from cva over the past year and a half.
---
Turns out there is a moon in this system h6 with a little bit of valuable goo so the guys in rogue put down an athanor to mine it from time to time. Obviously this is a bit contentious and draws some attention from the hostiles (cva) in the area so leads to a bit of mining drama.
---
It's good stuff and leads to some fun skirmishes and a really nice back and forth.  Well done today cva thanks for bringing something fun and engageable to the euro TRC members :)
---
Good shit
---
and after another fateful meeting eve became a less interesting place
---
Well bye.
---
Our alliance got evicted by Skillu, so we joined the large alliances...  
---
The community is basically killing their own playstyle.
---
Oh HECK no.  Have you seen the suggestions that get posted here?  Endless repeats of "Delete this" "Delete that", "Add this" "Change that", "CCP should do this thing with like 5 or 6 qualifiers".
---
With very, very few exceptions, these are hideously broken, ridiculous edge cases, or add no gameplay whatever.
---
(Also, people post them anyway.  You probably don't notice because they're lousy and get downvoted.)
---
I wonder what it would be like to be in a WoW raid group consisting of elite eve players.
---
I would assume the levels of rage would be quite disturbing. I would love it.

I will certainly have a lot more fun then you ;)
---
They need to find it when its a fight in their own war.
---
They have to invade or else they are gonna get evicted!
---
It happens mate.
---
Skillu was a refuge for quite a few smaller PVP groups that died over the last 2 years, my old corp included. Most people who didn't quit ended up there, sad to see that go tits up as well now.
---
Best hardcore alliance in recent memory, speaks volumes to the state of the game that the alliance is disbanding due the game itself.
---
no it wasn't, you just deleted it when it didnt get the response you wanted

no you gotta do it urself
---
goons made me download more RAM for the 64bit client

This is why I don't come here that often. It was a joke... I like SkillU.. have liked them for a long time. Talked about them several times. They are highly skilled and did great at medium and small fleet stuff. They were the #1 SOV entity for a few weeks because they didn't use a holder corp.. it was a goddamn joke, but you guys are a bunch of spazzes.
---
Well I mean its frowned upon and considered rmt but you could always sell your character. It's not our fault ccp doesn't have a way for disgruntled players to quit the game and recoup some of the RL money they spent on this game only for it to become something they dont enjoy. I'd put my character on Ebay for cash and do a character transfer for the buyer before I just biomass my char.

Bring fear back to eve. No local, no asset safety. Force people to fight or lose it all.
---
No problem. If you're looking for something beefier in the small ship drone line, the Ishkur and the Worm are both really good solo ships.
---
&gt;Ha we mined your ore

Welcome to 2019 EVE
---
Hey can I get back to TAPI now? I won't hold UALX against you guys.
---
so basically you disbanded and quit the game because of timezone structures ... lm ao have u not heard of alarm clock? idiots...
---
P
---
Won’t people just stay in highest? Or is there not enough spod?
---
o7 capqu, never got the chance to fly with you but your exploits in pizza wowed me when i was still a nascent eve player watching you guys farm TEST in Delve with all of 20-30 dudes.
---
Good luck to you and godspeed.
---
shockingly running a rental alliance is boring as shit.   
---
solid pvpers, but they never really challenged a decent group.  XIX and Solar were garbage by the time the dronelands flipped.  TRI was decent, but didn't have the numbers.  Otherwise SkullU just blued up all the large coalitions around it.  
---
Wish they had turned on their Ncdot masters or had taken the fight to Legacy or FRT.
---
I like motivating pings.
---
Why not? 
---
There’re so few groups and people worth playing with. Once they’re gone the game’s over. 
---
Who knows, maybe they like closure?
---
Surprisingly many tbh
---
&gt;  T2 carriers 
---
making some people drool at the thought alone...
---
But I'm sure you meant cruisers.
---
I think you mean .PACK is recruiting.
---
Some of those things you listed don't actually add isk to the economy
---
solid pvpers, but they never really challenged a decent group.  XIX and DRF were garbage by the time the dronelands flipped.  TRI was decent, but didn't have the numbers.  Otherwise SkullU just blued up all the large coalitions around it.  
---
I would increase bomb damage a substantial amount and adjust the explosion radius to where it only applies full damage to capitals. Make them more useful for bombing capitals but still somewhat effective on large subcaps. 
---
Right now bombs do 8k dmg and have an explosion radius of 400M. Capitals can have a signature of around 10k and 800k EHP for a dread all the way up to a signature of 22k and around 30 mil EHP for a Titan. 
---
So if bomb dmg is increased to say 30k and exp radius is increased to 5k you would have a total dmg potential of: 
---
8\*30k=240k 
---
A smaller target would only take a fraction of that: 
---
Avg battleship
---
400m/5km=0.08\*240k=19,200 dmg
---
Avg. Destroyer
---
75m/5km=0.015\*240k=3,600 dmg
---
A battleship MWDing would take about full dmg, so RIP
---
This would make bombers more useful against capitals and force fleets out of the deathballs we see now by making them spread out or risk taking significant damage from multiple bombing runs. 
---
I know what some of you are thinking: "That would make bombers OP", "Bombers shouldn't be able to take down capitals", etc., but think about it; Bombers are used in almost every major Sci-Fi franchise as anti-capital weapons. Capitals also have the emergency DCU they can burn to negate a huge amount of damage. Used properly, it could act to protect the capitals against at least one bombing run. 
---
The aggressor would also have to make a choice. If they have an enemy fleet bubbled they would have to risk  destroying the bubbles and allowing the fleet to escape. Strategic bubble placement could try to avoid this, but that's another choice that would have to be made. 
---
I just see a lot of opportunity to allow an emergent form of gameplay to take hold and break the stalemate we have with the supercapital wrecking balls. 
---
Love it, hate it?
---
I put an account through the blender about 3 years ago, and would up playing off and on again about 2 years ago. I'm either going to leave a ship full of plex adrift in a wormhole or make make some random noob very rich.
---
Capqu you are always welcome in goon
---
Skill u should park the caps, join the state protectorate and try being a faction warfare scrub before throwing in the towel
---
Politicians sell votes to corporations all the time irl.  This is just selling someone's skill farm votes for fake money for a game's high school-esque election.
---
The answer is wormholes my friend.
---
That doesn't make any of that a good thing.
---
"They want to disband by ending on a high note"  
---
What is that? :D
---
https://i.imgur.com/Z7MzQS7.png
---
does this mean we get our finns back? &lt;3
---
If you want to be a poor I guess. But don't massive crabs belong in high anyway? Let PIRAT and CODE sort those fat kids out.
---
solid pvpers, but they never really challenged a decent group.  XIX and DRF were garbage by the time the dronelands flipped.  TRI was decent, but didn't have the numbers.  Otherwise SkullU just blued up all the large coalitions around it.  So much potential wasted.  
---
Wish they had turned on Ncdot or had taken the fight to Legacy or FRT, would have been a good fight.
---
C6 ratting can do 700m under ten minutes, it scales up very quickly.
---
Honestly, the kind of pvp we've always liked was the fights where we fought outnumbered, against the odds. The real problem is forcing these fights has become more and more difficult, and in the end assets are so devalued that even if we or our enemies welp a fleet the loss is completely meaningless. The game has just become an endless citadel grind, with periods of occasional fights, but due to citadel timers you risk getting 500 dudes formed up vs your 100. 
---
In the end, as a small group focused entirely on pvp, the time investment was just not worth it. Citadels being a large part of the cancer that is killing the game, and the fact that you can't force weekend timers on short notice is a huge factor. 
---
In the end, we didn't really want to empire build. We never wanted dronelands, we just sort of.. ended up with it, by some cosmic fluke. But in the current state of eve, you either empire build, or you die.
---
I really appreciate you asking though, its a good sentiment. We had a good run, and it feels good to end on a good note.
---
This isn't inherently a bad idea.  I agree it's stupid, but I'm not gonna dismiss it completely.
---
Basically what he wants is an actual bomber.  Something that would be to caps like stealth bombers are to battleships.  This is a simple extension of the current stealth bomber, with a few changes:
---
* Lower mobility and higher tank (cruiser size?)
---
* Capital-scale damage &amp; explosion radius, bigger sig radius on bombs
---
And I can't say that this is a bad idea.  It's not the same as battleships, but it's not too hard to counter:
---
* Subcap support wing to shoot down bombs
---
* Space out your cap fleet before sieging
---
RIP PVP, EVE's dead Jim
---
:-( sad day indeed. You guys were the best. I had fun flying with you guys on the rare occasion we fleeted together. Hope to see you guys around, the ones that continue to play.

you  have link for beta mumble please :) i search but not sure is good
---
Nobody FCing had anything to do with renters. 
---
Check the timezones on FRT, Legacy, and NC structures - you CANNOT fight people in this game. It's impossible to make them fight. 
---
The only fights we ever got vs legacy in EUTZ were pretty fun but ended up being 800-1k vs ~200 after we won too many times.
---
\&gt; Make sure you don't close down the Discord so we can all play WoW. This is very important.

Yeah right.....

I mean, his comeback was the kind of "Ooooh I'm so smart and witty" comment I would have made when I was 15. Interpret it as salt if you want.
---
All Imperium are Goons, all Legacy are Test, all Panfam are Horde.
---
No1 cares about the backup singers.
---
I concur
---
Who else should they join for fleet sized PVP?
---
They don't want to join some blob of 5k dudes flying 2 module doctrines with 300 insufferable fleetmates who are more focused on their rorqual alt, they're interested in smaller fun groups, not some corporate office culture super serious leadership pve blob. There's not a single other group like that.
---
Meanwhile 30 eagles have died in those 5 hours :joy:
---
Check out my idea
---
I begrudgingly respect you guys. We fought you in Genesis a few years back when you were a lot smaller.
---
We won the majority of fights and timers but  SF are relentless and seemingly have bottomless pockets.
---
In the end we just couldn't keep up with our relatively small losses and started missing timers, you guys moved on looking for the next fight.
---
They tried to invade TEST twice, they publically stated that the destruction of TEST and Esoteria is their goal, but okay you run with your narrative.
---
Yeah I love when minute-by-minute reports are in all caps. Feels like one of those naval movies where officers on the ship are receiving intel over a terminal.
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
I just came back to eve, why are people leaving ? What happened ?
---
we put an astra down in tene, took sov, deployed campers
---
test moved the super fleet from eso

ggwp
---
Your loyalty makes it shit for you
---
P3ak was the ones who enjoyed the game the most in the alliance, and still do. They were a fresh breath of air, and will be an absolute asset whereever they go. It'll just miss hearing PEAK BOYS TO THE PEAK CHANNEL after every fleet :(
---
I can fly the ishkur but not the worm and my shield skills are not to t2 yet.
---
I literally just resubbed, what's wrong with the game?
---
C2/NSS life
---
For the beginning, things that get consumed most are a dependable source of income. As with everything, dependable isn't the most profitable. But with low skills, check into ammunition, t1 frigates and rigs. 
---
Rigs need salvage which you can easily obtain yourself with low skills and little experience. 
---
But keep in mind that the whole production process is  more or less a Browser Game. If you enjoy it, great. If not, there's a lot of other stuff to do. 
---
Finding like-minded and friendly people to play with should be your top priority. Eve lives of its social interactions more than most other MMOs.
---
Oh I had no clue about the Muninns, I was just laughing cause I thought they only brought Jackdaws, which would of been pathetic.
---
&gt; Time to beat the fuck out of my dick.
---
Priorities
---
F. The last great 0.0 PVP alliance, until BL reforms.
---
Can I have your isk? Same in game name
---
Some things may just never be great. A lot of core systems are very entrenched.
---
Changing the whole way the system security and null sec work may be too much too late
---
Pussy
---
Quite a run it was, [389 systems with some 60 players and 1200 characters](https://i.imgur.com/Auvt91H.jpg).
---
If I forget all the bad times we had a good time.
---
Can you confirm not troll?
---
Because holy shit who cares about the invasion... Im kinda surprised they even bothered to change the background, but hey, Im still getting used to this idea that Eve is somehow a PvE game now.
---
Don't they primarily hire from the community? Aren't all the big names in CCP players?
---
Join a militia, pick a side, lets play!
---
Except abyssals
---
Mad respect for the option chosen. Best go on a high note than turn into PL
---
imagine needing to call goons for your offensive war
---
To be fair, one of the appeals of Eve for some people is that there's not the grindy treadmill of burnout that there is with some games, or at least not as much of one.  Feeling like I can not log in for a day and be out nothing is a nice feeling sometimes.  I'm aware injectors undercut that, but it's still part of the culture of the game dating to pre-injectors, and honestly is one of their more insidious side effects.
---
Alot of high skilled pilots in skillu, hopefuly most of them keep playing and enrich some alliances in need.
---
:corn: :tractor: :cow:
---
Structures have ehp directly linked to ADM levels and drop 50% of the assets within the structure. They also only have 2 timers.
---
Introduce better access to hard to reach areas like Malpais, Period Basis, Branch.
---
Introduce a depleting multiplier on fleet boosts linked with number of fleet members.
---
Give blackops an AOE ewar w/ bastion like module needed, this will add a new level of gameplay w/ risk.
---
Finally CCP should buy rights to Total Annihilation and convert Planetary Interaction into a strategy game linked with EVE so we can play EVE while we play EVE.
---
Sure you can fight people in this game.  If you are upset and quitting because you aren't guaranteed to win, then eh fine.  If you have 2 trillion in isk, then start dropping structures on your terms.  If you are short on numbers, then team up or drop bigger shit, or change tactics, or something.  Not even trying because you are afraid to lose is a waste of potential.
---
I enjoy the PL trash talk as much as everyone else.... but all I heard was an excuse as a result of pride to make such a statement. Do whatever you got to do to quit but PL is still one of the top killers month after month. The meta changes, hence why we're still active.
---
masterminding a backdoor into the new pizza gets harder every year!
---
Rollback to 2015?
---
They'd rather fly across the whole map to fight the same people at someone else's timer
---
Wonderful alliance, from top to bottom. Speaking for P3AK our only regret is that we didn't join sooner (dunno what the retard op is on about).
---
FWIW what capqu said in the recording. There was zero drama (bar one guy who turned out to be a spy all along, who cares), no arguments, just frustration with the degree timezone tank and oppressive mechanics of citadels. For a small group, it's just hard to eke fun out of the game anymore.
---
If ccp don't change things real fucking quick then there's going to be unironic colony collapse disorder in this game, on a scale not seen since phoebe, and probably worse. 
---
skill urself was the best alliance I've been in, from personalities to competence. Somehow a 1200 char alliance is the largest sov holder in the game, twice as large as TAPI if you include the sub renters. And its main content creators just cannot be fucked to play anymore.
---
I'm going to keep playing, I still enjoy enough of the game and there are still kicks you can get nowhere else. But I think ccp has about 6 months to announce some healthy changes, and 12 months to implement them, or this game is dead.
---
sad to see an alliance with so many good pilots disband. I can honestly say that in my time in GSF and SV, skillu is the only alliance that we havent won a direct fight against.
---
bye bye
---
and then you gave up.  again, SkillU took the fights it could win and ran away when there was a challenge.  What is the defining moment of SkillU?  The eviction of the DRF renters?  Kicking the dead body of XIX?  overrunning a dead on their feet TRI?
---
if panfam wasnt there, goons wouldnt be. when panfam ran out, goons followed them.
---
I will :\*
---
I miss you Saber, I know someone will press the button to unblue the goons one day, then I'll be back &lt;3
---
well shit.. i guess it's time.. let's all join goons and get it over with and close the server already.. we need to remember wow classic comes out this fall.. let's focus on what matters
---
Dude, but skins and mobile games
---
Everything. But mostly the fact that it's not 2005-2007 anymore.
---
The blue donut is strong with this server.
---
Masterminding a backdoor into the new pizza gets harder every year!
---
But nah, you were part of the most fun I ever had in an MMO and I will miss following the coordinated skillu crew.
---
dude right, I always found it hilarious. kinda took (hashtag)pride in it too when I was in the alliance. a friend of mine once tried to flex on me with how he was only playing for several months and already *managed to join **the** goons* who "own half of the game space". then he took a look at dotlan
---
felt like pwning a kid in fortnite or smth lol

Three suggestions for the opening of links:
---
* Install qt5-websockets

* Install xdg-utils

* If using an Ubuntu based system make an exception in AppArmour
---
I fucking love WAFFLES. &lt;3
---
You literally got baited hard by an obvious troll....
---
And they got a fight
---
Thanks, mate!
---
Thanks for the advice!
---
t1 frigs have a pretty poor engagement range in lowsec, you are at a severe disadvantage against almost everything outside of your own class. T1 destroyers are a much better, cheap option that'll get you lots of fights that you can win
---
I shoot crosses on a tri-monthly basis as a member of horde. As also a member of Koahi Squad for years, surely I can be booshed back into the warm embrace of good salvage in delve for my tri-monthly me-vs-the-ai showdown? Surely!
---
Ishkur is a fun ship. You can fit it a lot of different ways. Drone+rail kiter, blaster brawler, shield buffer, armor buffer, hull tank. It's a little slow but it'll get good mileage if you fly it right.
---
I like flying it medium shield buffer with blasters. Punish things in close with 300 dps, and then when someone inevitably tries to kite you, you're still able to keep good dps (140ish) on them with your drones.
---
The thing is that SkillU will be remember for absolutely nothing.  Nobody will care in 6 months.  Just another rental alliance that wasted the resources of the dronelands and did jack shit.

Calm down edgelord. Results could either be during the keynote or separately on a Twitch stream like last year. We’ll find out soon enough.
---
Fighting you guys was fun. Sorry to see you go. Good luck in your future endeavors.
---

---
I'd say Gobbins is pretty accessible.
---
This is like the fall of spaghettiCo all over. I guess the good news is maybe there will be another another iteration. 
---
Literally when Pizza died, I knew I would never reach that level of fun again.
---
i am so proud of my boys for finally realizing this game isn't worth playing and acting on it :')
---
Yep. Decrease the amount of sites by 50-80% keep loot as is. The space race would be on!
---
fuck Snuff!
---
np fam. Abyssals are a lot of fun. Just go into it with the understanding that that ship is gonna get roasted eventually, either by your own mistakes or by your freaking ISP (rip Battle Goose I...). Your goal is to make enough to pay off the ship as fast as you can, then you can start taking risks.
---
Try joining a wh corp for a couple of months. It will make them much less scary
---
ok who cares? you??? lmfao
---
As a 2010 player I agree. If you treat the game like Elite Dangerous you will burn out. Eve is definitely a sandbox. You just gotta find what floats your boat and do it a lot.
---
As in logs in frequently?
---
If you want to get rid of that ugly "Bandicam" url at the top of your screen, I can recommend using [https://obsproject.com](https://obsproject.com). 
---
In the transversal video I think it contrary to show the video with increased speed. If you have never heard of this, you might need more time to process it.
---
Check out my idea in this thread
---
Agreed :(
---
May I have some ISK?
---
\*cough* UALX \*cough*
---
Heh, I know. That's why I bought 2 Gilas with 2x equipment from the start, already set to use the second one if needed.
---
Am0k. Is Recruiting.
---
who are you
---
imagine being a tapi cuck lmao
---
I hope everybody there has a blast!
---
There’s two guys really notable in my corp in that regard, one lost 7 dreads in that fight. The other 5-6 lol
---
It’s surprisingly difficult in lowsec with no/little tidi.
---
Was being sarcastic on that last point but looks like it was lost in text. /s for next time
---
You guys considered wormhole space or Thera? Personally having much more fun there then I was in null and seeing your future listed as Frat is kind of surprising given the nature of P3AKs gameplay. 
---
In any case, shit news, glad you folks are sticking around but Eve just got a bit worse overall. Good luck out there.
---
that's for if the game ever gets fun and we reform sorry
---
Petition to get OP banned from Reddit.
---
CCP takes 4 years to implenet citadels. There's nothing that instils any confidence that CCP can make any changes in 6 months.
---
Well yes that does seem like kind of a pain
---
Yeah, who knows, maybe there'll be another iteration down the line. Skill urself was the most fun I've had with the game since 2003, and the people in it were an absolute joy to play with. Both old pizza members, and the many new additions.
---
Didn't you guys dock up and run away the other day? I didn't see a smugpost on reddit about that. Seems like these "little victories" are all you guys have left and you must make them public otherwise people will see how fragile you actually are.
---
Panic Attack is a good mid sized corp. Lots of action and support.
---
??
---
Probably an unpopular choice but I use a Pacifier in wh, find it makes everything happen way quicker, even faster than Helios (although Helios faster nav, quite often ended up bouncing 5m off the can). Warping, navigating, aligning, scanning, hacking... all happens fast. Made my money back and then some in an hour or so before dt so was pretty worth it. I'll sometimes jump right through into null and hack my way back to HS, sometimes getting chased, which adds to the excitement. Sure I'll get ganked eventually but I've made a few billion doing this so it will be glorious when it happens!

By encouraging people to bloc vote against their bloc vote, aren't you basically doing what they are doing?
---
BTW this post probably would have been more effective 5 days ago lmao, when most of the people who cared about it hadn't yet voted.
---
I get what he wants, the concept just doesn't translate well to capitals because of mobility issues.
---
Let's put it as a practical issue:  how many bombs would you think would be a good idea for killing a carrier?  A titan?
---
&gt;Subcap support wing to shoot down bombs
---
Seems incredibly difficult to get right.  If the bombs are easy enough to blap, why aren't the caps just smartbomb-screening, making these things pretty useless?  If they're not (or you arbitrarily make them immune to smartbombs), then that takes an incredible level of coordination to reliably clear bombs that I don't think many FCs will risk.  Add to that, if you maintain bomb mechanics in that they damage each other, there's the whole mess of shooting the bombs down may actually mean you take _more_ damage.  It's incredibly thorny and I just don't how, if these can viably nuke a cap blob, you ever bring out a cap blob.
---
&gt;Space out your cap fleet before sieging
---
Well and good while sieging, but doesn't really help when, say, cynoing in, bumping on a gate, landing from warp, etc.
---
What is a CSM?
---
this day's been rough, skillu for one disbands, now we have an unironic post of players being proud about mining other's rocks.
---
most of us tried facwar like 5 years ago it was garbage even back then when there were actual groups to fight
---
Can I have a trillion or two of your stuff? Just let me wet my beak...
---
Wrong thread buddy
---
Shooting crosses? Man you really won Eve. Those are LOONNG gone.
---
God dammit, gotta change my flair now
---
Well, they might be,  maybe they announce on day 2 in the room that is half the capacity of day 1
---
yeah and who will remember goon linemember #46543 in 5 minutes?
---
I'm doing the best I can. Bashing undefended structures is a full-time job.
---
Can i have your stuff
---
I would be interested in seeing them dissolve into FRAT or GOTG.
---
no no im a nullsec noob in PLA corporation!
---
dude, tapi alone have 2 CORPS that are bigger than skillu. all of the groups you mentioned were much bigger than skill urself, take your bitter shit on up the road
---
Nothing beats the thrill of getting chased through null with 500m loot in the cargo hold!
---
it is a do able things but not as simple as people who just off handly say it is.
---
woah shit this is real sad
---
The CSM is the Council of Stellar Management. It is a focus group under the (free) employ of CCP that is the first to be involved with new ideas that could potentially come to EVE Online. They are the ones who give CCP the input on their good and bad ideas before those ideas go to testing and then live servers.
---
They are very important.
---
Nah dude. As someone who ran multiple jf for years i always saw amarr as pointless. Didnt have tbe volume or prices to warrant visiting or dumping ore loot or mins at. Even wben living in delve or deep south i went to jita
---
Off shoring killed the secondary trade hubs moving that action elsewhere. But hey....Jita 4-4 is still popping off
---
They just told me to download some ram...
---
I would not consider this even an "event". There was nothing happening in game.
---
I considered it more like a gift from CCP. What "events" did we have at Eves last birthdays? We got some redeemable items and that was it? Do I remember that right?
---
Well, I rather have that login-thingy then, but that's just me. As said before: would not consider it even an event, not mad about it.
---
\&gt; Vote Xenuria. 
---
oof... you lost all credibility bud
---
This comment aged well. Bye skillu, was nice fighting you :)
---
Yeah, Alpha, so cloak is out. Not dying is kinda a priority if you're carrying 10mil+ worth of relic/data loot :P
---
Dunno why it matters its just a puppet show of who the popular idiots are of the year rather than people at the head of different fields and professions of eve like it should be. And ccp just ignores what they have to say regardless.
---
Maybe this is the Earth shattering message that will get CCP off their asses and pay attention to what needs to change.
---
Please don't shadowban me.

---
All the best Cap, you guys had a rocking alliance, start to finish.
---
Well I mean your strongest ally disbanding is surely a "bye frt" eh?
---
Do you have any recommendations on who to vote for?
---
ah, fair 'nuff
---
You were, to this day, the worst/best enemy Iron ever had. You're obnoxiously good at the game, aggressive , knowledgeable. As humans you're fairly scummy, so go fuck yourself there.
---
But you were good for the game. Sorry to see you go
---
Toonies!
---
Vote for your friendly PVP CSM candidates, like Elo Knight and Cable Uta!
---
Oh wait.
---
True, but then I could lose my job and couldn't pay for power or internet
---
"newbie friendly" alliances, all the big ones, are only interested in creating new line members, foot soldiers. And to get MORE new players than the other groups who do the same thing, for the long term victory. Being part of that can be fun if you enjoy it but at the same time it's not like you're going to find your own path, niche or become a content creator.
---
It works for some, not for others.
---
Don't I know it mate. But there it is.
---
This is exactly what I'm thinking. What has worked for you? Are you a part of one of the big ones? How has it worked for you so far?
---
we are all together.I will saying skill is a powerful tough alliance.And best pvp player in newEden.thankyou
---
fuck reddit and these retarded double posts.

please upvote the dominant post lol thanks in advance

Null sec powers have consolidated so much that there are only really 4ish (Goons, Test, Frat, Panfam) super powers that can compete and those 4 are too scared to ever really fight each other for fear of losing. End result is the little guys get beat down so much they can’t do anything and the big guys are too scared to pick on someone their own size.
---
same
---
Goons calling anyone pubbies in 2019. tiptoppest of lels
---
Mmmmm, PanFam tears.  Delish.
---
After only played this game 4months as a noob I joined this top-level alliance, and spent over a year with all the best pvp players in this game. Had a lot of fun and achievements with you guys, feels bad but I understand this decision. 
---
I know you guys disbanded and regrouped several times and I'm willing to meet with you guys if this happen again in the future.
---
To me Capqu is the greatest leader and Barra is the best FC in this game, just want to show my respect to all of you guys(but Barra said never read reddits).
---
Can I have your stuff ?
---
this is so true.
---
Ok we cann all admit that goons have won the game. Can we just reset it now?
---
I'm not gonna pretend to know the answers.  This is just my viewpoint:
---
* Bomber wings are a common sight in large fleet battles.  They're not oppressive, but they're not negligible either.  I think capital bombs can hit the same zone.
---
* You have a point about coordination.  I've never seen defenders used, I presume they target the closest bomb.  Probably a modified firewall formation would be the easiest solution, assuming all bombs come from one direction.  (PS: do bombs blow up or just die when killed?)
---
* Re smartbombs, they're limited to a few kilometers.  It might be worth trying, but bombs apply full damage to the edge of their radius.  So you could hit them from outside local smartbomb range.
---
* I've considered trying to bomb fleets on the in-cyno (with machs a la RnK) but subcaps are too fast for that.  Caps are a lot slower though, so you have a larger window to nab them all in one run.  (Let's say cap bombs have the same damage radius as subcap bombs.)  Now you have a short period of vulnerability before your caps are effective.  I don't know what's likely to happen in that time.
---
* Alternatively, you could bring in several cynos.  I don't know what disadvantages you'd get, besides coordination and a slight spread in range.  Each cluster might be bombed, or you might have them spread out a little bit (but less than if you took one cyno).
---
We might also consider how battles would play out, but I don't have enough experience to do more than guess.
---
Can you fly cloaky things? If yes, Wingspan might be a fun address to ring.
---
And as others have mentioned: read on r/evejobs or in the official forum a bit.
---
this is such a weird post
---
&gt;pwning
---
jesus
---
It was a flawlessly executed campaign.
---
Lmao good job provibloc
---
I like your idea, but just introduce a capital bomb. Large resistance against other bombs but keep the current bomb type as well, kinda like the void bombs. I still would like to nuke doctrine fleets going to and frow and excavators but with limited carrying capacity of ammo, bombers are already nicely limited in deployment resources. Just make the capital bombs bigger? Max skills for the capital bomb version (T2 launcher) but instead of two loaded only make one. Having a large number of smaller things nuking one person's large toy is appealing and necessary for the food chain. 
---
The less CCP has to tweek instead of just adding seems more likely to be seen (or so I've witnessed).
---
[Citation Needed]
---
Nothing. That's the problem. CCP is just so out of touch with the community.
---
This is how I will now end my Eve career. Whenever that happens. Thanks!
---
I don't think you know who Xenuria is lol.
---
hh brothers
---
see you in better games
---
Did he say jump? im jumping
---
&gt; If you notice, Killah Bee, the person who was responsible for and completely owned up to bringing evidence of wrongdoing on the CSM was placed in the section where the votes don't matter. 
---
That was the wrongdoing that didnt happen?
---
[better version](https://youtu.be/9wqnZeoyIJ4)
---
ISK depreciates more than most assets, so I'd agree.  Plex or investment assets are like putting your money in the bank to gain interest.
---
I hope our paths cross again when the game has moved closer to a place you'd like it to be in. Until then, take care my friend.
---
fighting is over rated, dominating is key
---
Ah. So basically 2014 problems kept worsening. Thanks !
---
Okay, don't vote for Xenuria. But definitely vote for the other two. Then whoever your heart desires.
---
Citation from what?
---
I used to be but quit it, went cold turkey on my accounts because not only did it become annoying and terrible it also got meaningless and boring. I started anew and put some limitations on it because through limitations you become more creative. So just ONE account, do it all with that one, that forces you in to teamwork, building relationships relying on others.
---
I've made a character that ensures a decent income and I made another character who instead of following other people's ideas and paths is going to follow my own. So I set up a corp and once it's all in place and I did my preparations I'm going to recruit new players for it who, like me, are not looking to become a cog in the machine but want to get something more out of it, in a smaller but hand picked group.
---
I've done that before years ago, teaching new players EVE and PVP proper. Worked out well then, might work out again. And if not at least it kept me busy.
---
&gt;there are only really 4ish (Goons, Test, Frat, Panfam) super powers that can compete
---
As we are seeing in the north, Panfam isn't really able to compete at all, and for all intents and purposes Goons and Test are one power, which leave FRT.
---
That is correct. The wrongdoing did not occur and Killah likely felt that it didn't but, because he's an honest individual, he brought forward the evidence anyway. He was not bound by any rule to confess that he was wrong but he openly accepted CRITICISM, INSULTS, even DEATH THREATS to keep his integrity.
---
Op success.
---
It’s varied but invariably I hear the same thing over and over again, this is not the game they started playing. There is no challenge, no consequences. But worse there is a Reinforcing Cycle - people leave because there is no action, so there are less players so there is even less action so more players leave.
---
Truest shit ever spoken bud
---
It's a very effective ship for the job but the amount of ISK you have to invest in the ship makes it a pretty risky proposition! The hull is worth 6 Helioses, or over 700 Imicuses. Whether the performance boost is worth the risk is up to you!
---
To be fair when goons really entered the field server crash
---
&gt; wakeup call for CCP,
---
The "summer of rage" should have been a wake up call as well. What did that change?
---
why do i get the feeling you are xenuria trying to psyop~ some more votes?
---
u/CCP_Falcon 
---
Got that?
---
Btw best recruiter Nonztop
---
I just voted Merk one million times. I like his voice.
---
I’ll miss Skillu. Definitely one of the most chill, least drama ridden, most competent alliance I have seen and it’s a damn shame they are disbanding. 
---
As for the future, P3AK are joining that strong, independent alliance, Iron Armada.
---
 the gift that keeps giving
---
Agree. However, that's old footage. I use shadowplay now.
---
Interesting perspective on the transversal bit. I'll have to think about it.
---
Technically frat and test, goons and pan fam are fighting just not much is happening in many of the fights compared to the forces arrayed.
---
Amarr. For when the exit hole to Jita is too far.
---
Man, I was a citizen of the drone lands in these times and I so much enjoyed it when all those "dronelords" like Fafer just got destroyed while still talking "war is basically won".
---
Linemembers of drone land corps who have been around for years were lied to for so long and then skill urself kinda liberated us by force. We needed to find new homes, new corps and alliances and that had been the best thing that happened to me in my eve life. Godspeed to all absolute madmen that were part of it.
---
I'd very much appreciate your feedback afterwards.
---
The Rogue Consortium is recruiting. We're a small alliance in Providence. I've been playing Eve for about 6 months, joined them about 2 months into that, and it's been a blast. I was looking for what you were looking for... small enough that I wasn't Line F1 Monkey #4567, but large enough to have a meaningful presence. Happy to say that's us :)
---
We're vastly outnumbered/outresourced by the dominating power in this chunk of nullsec, but it makes for a lot of interesting content. 
---
Message me in-game (Arlus Heluene) if you're interested in joining or if you have any questions.
---
Unfortunately, as much as I love Merklechen as a person, he has no business being on the CSM.
---
I am not Xenuria. I am BraveNewbean.
---
such an underrated comment

---
Will be interesting to see what Legacy " allies" fire and mango do with all the space opening up.  Also some of the little guys fighting it out in areas like etherum reach might be posed for massive expansion

Jokes on you, I would've voted for Steve Ronuken for free!

Pls highsec pvp was much more challenging then null. Hell most people in null think they pvp because they can anchor and press f1. But yea ccp decided to Coddle the new players and it hasn’t worked. I remember back when I started playing people would throw out cans and label it commando gear or something like that in hopes that you would take the stuff inside. Sure hazing the new players was probably the lowest form of pvp in game But when it happened to me I just wanted to get back at them and that set me off and learning PVP. Ultimately it was fun and set eve apart. Now there is no PVP exposure for new players in highsec. Not too long ago I ran into a guy who had been playing for a year and never went into space below .7 - no one had ever exposed him to pvp or told him what was what. Ultimately hiding what makes the game interesting from their new players just doesn’t work in the long run.
---
&gt;They so desperately want to control the CSM and by proxy the game. 
---
I'm all for democracy, but you're retarded if you think the CSM controls the game
---
It just makes me sad people having spent so long in this game to delete all that effort etc. I maybe live dreaming of a better eve. Etc
---
I was unironically expecting the video to be a few minutes of absolutely nothing
---
For all those SkillU refugees, I'd like to inform you that BOOF is recruiting.
---
You may not be fans of TRI, but you might be fans of competent retards.
---
It means I'm waiting to see proof.
---
I'm never sure which hurts more, one carbon or absolutely nothing.
---
It moved to 1DQ
---
Take your own advice and stop complaining about complaint posts and post some actual solutions
---
Be the change you want to see
---
Don't talk mean words to my babe
---
I didn't say that the CSM controls the game. I said they're a proxy to controlling the game. They are that.
---
You are retarded.
---
Proof of what?
---
I'm sad to see more content leave.
---
Of everything you felt the need to REEEEEEEE about.
---
We already have mobile cyno inhibitors, why haven’t they stoped our issues with super cap umbrellas?
---
CCP doesn't do short term, they only make serious changes years after there needed and minor changes are at best 6 months or more away.
---
More about getting new players then keeping old ones. Thats should be focus.
---
hh brothers the cyno is not yet lit

Wherever you end up going to, you need to get on voice chat (mumble/TeamSpeak). I know in KarmaFleet standing comms, we're constantly having new (and old returning) players asking questions about stuff, and there's a few older guys who patiently and happily explain things over and over again. 
---
I personally got much better results talking to people than typing in a chat room. Best of luck finding a new home!
---
It was good and I think you definitely have a lot of potential
---
I would have appreciated if you explained what exactly wormhole space WAS but that’s likely a fault of my own since I haven’t done all the agency tutorials yet.

From what i have noticed there are way to many gankers these days for hisec hauling to be profitable. you are vastly more likely to loose your ship in the simple 12 jump run between jita and amarr than afk carrier ratting in nullsec. personally i think the increase in ganker activity is mainly due to people being bored as hell with how nullsec/lowsec content has been over the last few years.
---
Okay, well it was initiated by a jabber ping from the Mittani. So, check jabber or ask your friends. Everything else is influenced by the ping.
---
Citation granted.
---
Iam in Gainesville as well :0
---
Maybe you could create another group that openly promotes ratting and mining and is willing to defend each other when said mining or ratting is threatened by opposing forces?
---
damn. personally i liked skillu. they were actually competent. shame :c
---
The frt thing was capqus idea, the spy got kicked before we came into channel and discussed options.
---
But they said we are scummy people, so not anymore.
---
Totally worth it, and yeah I can see the merit of doing it the cheap way too, like you mentioned. Like I said however, made the money back in just over an hour (got lucky with a C3 full of plush relic sites) plus I have a Helios all fitted up and ready to go as a backup. Yet to be ganked doing this and I've had a few attempts on me. I'm always aligned when I'm hacking and ship is insta Warp, even if someone uncloaks right next to me I have a chance if I hit warp fast enough, so it's a pretty low risk play style in a relatively high risk high reward environment. I'll lose it sooner or later but I hope I'll be a couple billion richer for it which was certainly the case with the Helios which I also haven't lost yet. I did lose one Helios to rats like an idiot after a 5 year break from the game. Woopsie!
---
UNDEFEATED. CHAMPIONS.
---
oh no not again
---
It was a fun fight though.
---
That was really annoying, for like 15 min that's all I was getting trying to target anything. Apparently the fighter squad 30km away is way too far for me
---
It's very important when you mention Merk's voice to point out its smooth and sultry nature, Plz fix kk thx.
---
I heard TRI is recruiting ?
---
DELET THIS
---
The most fun I had in eve was when I was in Brave living in Fade under constant threat of eviction and constant content. Someone trying to invade where I live sounds like good content and fun to me.
---
You should strongly consider fitting named versions of modules rather than tech 1.
---
Right click, show info, go to variations tab and you will see all named versions.
---
Named are always better, have less fitting requirements also, use less cap, better stats, and they dont always break the bank
---
Thanks for all the help!
---
Obligatory "Eve has sound?" comment.
---
Test and friends beat frat and friends. Some capitals. No supers or tits.
---
It will be up to you once you take your proper seat at the csm to fix the game. Make yourself worthy of our votes.
---
I too enjoy killing all content
---
&gt; I'm never going to get as much help to learn the game PROPERLY
---
Been around since 2009.  Still learning.
---
Have never learned 'PROPERLY', just had fun instead.
---
I actually listened to the comms. It's quite relevant.
---
and make them permanent
---
In Brave we want you to have fun, if you want to be a foot soldier, a leader, or a solo player there is room for all those things.  I'd encourage you to look at interest groups (Sigs) to find a smaller group to talk to.  For the record Brave is about having fun and learning along the way, not just recruit line members.  Small groups are good but don't have the always on and available benefit of large groups.   7o good luck
---
Kinda sad that it has to be preached over and over and over again, but the only language modern game devs/publishers understand is :
---
Vote with your wallet!
---
I feel like we are a bit late on this with EVE Online since, as someone in another thread put it, "EVE is on a Runescape maintenance mode right now".
---
Unless the EVE IP changes hands, i sadly doubt anything will happen :(
---
Hahahaha
---
Hahahah guys.... Every single post is from test. You don't see that?? :D they're afraid!!
---
Use Lutris. Way simpler to get EVE working in it.
---
🎶I beat my dick like it owes me money🎶
---
No
---
As I'm reducing my involvement in eve and preparing to go dormant for a while, you're suggesting that "content" is only related to space fights while neglecting literally every other mechanic in the game.  What you're actually saying "I don't agree with how this game has changed".
---
fuckk off
---
Can a tractor beam be used in combat to slow an enemy ship down like a stasis Web? Or is it just for salvaging ops?
---
It lead to the Crucible expansion, which imo, was the best expansion EVE has ever gotten. It was just so many bugfixes and new QOL stuff. Just SOOOO much of it.
---
It also refocused CCP from "walking in stations" to "flying in space".
---
And the leaked Hilmar mail showed us, that he is just a moron and should have been replace as head of CCP 10 years ago.
---
SkillU, a waste of potential.  Had the dronelands and rental income for a year and did jack shit nothing.
---
Your posting says all that anyone needs to say about how bitter you totally aren't.
---
That could be a thing. I like the idea of a capital bomb being larger. It makes sense. That could mitigate some concerns over being too powerful. A T1 launcher is 150m3 and could fit 1 bomb, and a T2 is 300m3 and could fit 2. I like it
---
Well, no :D you're the bluebell, don't mix it up
---
please, tell me what is the defining moment for SkillU?  They had the dronelands and rental income for a year and did jack shit nothing.
---
The only thing that coulda made ur alliance better is if u got Space to come play there. o7 boys.
---
I hope CCP will understand that EvE must be changed. No one is interested in projects where content you are looking for 2-4 hours.

someone once had an officer spawn while rokrqual mining !

the only joy in this game I have left is killing an endless amount of krabs in their afk VNIs but even that has its fucking limits.

Unfortunately Falcon isn’t the head of CCP.

Salvage only
---
nice.  probably added like $2.40 to the RMT fund.
---
CSM will be the scapegoat for this. CCP can't be wrong, and unchecked player activity can't be one of the main reasons player count is dropping like a rock. Alts don't count.

Fixes the multi-boxing issue

i huff gas  in my praxis  5x  t2 suckers   7 t cargo expanders 3 cargo rigs.. well crap no huffing drones :(
---
mining inn   similar fit gnosis  is just cheaper.  5 suckers  6 cargo extenders tt3  cargo rigs..   tons of room for tanking on both praxis/gnosis..
---
i recommend  mining in those two ships only to expers and  thos who wish  to avoid  CODE .. CODE vasion isnt that hard,they  dont gank mining battleships mining battlecruisers
---
I blame the mods
---
Ok. Luv ya for content but nothing more :*
---
Your probably going to want a wh corp.. Hs corps are a joke ls is deadsec and everything in null is either renter or a pet in some capacity... 
---
How to find one is even harder.. Honestly go fly around and die.. Most people that kill you solo will talk to you after just dont be butthurt about it. When this happens it honestly the best way to make connections. Most friends are made from a fight.. I ended up making a batphone friend a few years ago because we fought them. 
---
Eve is worse than RL for go make friends.. Eve sucks without someone to talk to. No comunity to mingle with. Even getting into a hs comunity gives you friends you can talk to and learn from. Do something with if you have the drive you will find someone.
---
I would offer my corp but were literally three dudes most of the time.
---
How would you even begin to recruiting that when there's a well established group doing so.
---
I mean I’m recruiting for Classic..
---
They were probably alt tabbing to their titans to drop on you, since its delve after all
---
What if, you know, titans and supers couldn't jump as far and as often? What if they had to gate around? What if a groups reach was decreased, while also increasing the respawn rates of ore anoms? Or any other simple adjustment that keeps unchecked player activities from ruining everything? 
---
Nevermind, just downvote me to hell.
---
Who fucking cares.
---
We were brawling ^OUTRAGEOUS right up until then, I was all set for a multi-hour slugfest and to cancel my plans for the night, but man was I lucky enough to be disappointed.
---
Yup - when you can’t win against a superior opponent it is often the case that a sore ass loser bitches about the rules of the game itself.
---
The Irony here is you're clearly a J4g

&gt;if panfam wasnt there, goons wouldnt be. when panfam ran out, goons followed them.

You cared enough to comment.

Wtf. We're doing skillu guild in classic, sort ur shit out zelden ffs. We need the zerg.

what the fuck, is this just a summary of the reddit thread?

Long story short mwds suck use oversized ab does the same thing but no sig bloom so that sabre cant lock you before you recloak.

Yes, we censor any and all no no talk. We're deeply concerned about your delicate sensibilities, I assure you.

Eh YouTube has volume control. The alternatives are silence or 15+ mins of comms at 2-4x speed and as hilarious as that would be it also wouldn’t add anything.

Thanks though

So that means we’re in the middle now?  I’m so confused

Meh go flex on the eve forums
---
You'll probably have better luck posting this on the sales thread located on the EVE official forums.
---
So?
---
i’ve not played eve since November last year could someone please summarize whats happened politically in that time?
---
I'm betting their plan involves not looking at reddit b/c of all these shitposts.
---
Part of the problem is understanding: Do you wish to be taught, or do you wish to learn? 
---
**IF you are taught**, you only learn what you are told
---
**IF you learn**, you can then teach others and yourself
---
Players do what fits them. If not joining a corp is right for you, then do that. If not, do something else that fits. Don't think you need to do what everyone else does to enjoy the game.
---
Props to you and your guys. Never flew with ya but I've been in that position. Best of luck.
---
I mean we had like 20 people at the time in null and we used this tactic well against trolls.
---
wish I could play this game
---
" Vote Xenuria. "   
---
you lost me at this point, going to be honest with you
---
Its not a bad idea... but the prices are fucked for the packs and there for the reason to do it is... nope.. 
---
There should be a reason to bring an orca fleet in and not just run it as a venture. Idk I would prefer a tierd reward based on how much ore you turn it. So you go in with a venture and you wont get shit. But get a whole orca with barges fleet and your actually doing something. I realize this screams bring mpre alts but if it is balanced with veldspar mining it might be worth it for hardcore hs miners.. Or corp mining op or something you know.. Do pay outs like incursions or as LP or something but fuck these preassembled packs for more than market price.
---
Holy shieeeeeeeeeet
---
Lets do eet!
---
Stuff.
---
tl;dr there is a Chinese alliance on Tranquility, now. Otherwise, not much else of significance.
---
End up with Titan's DD, as always
---
Very cool
---
Had to check that this wasn’t eve onion
---
Bro I hauled ass home and worked from home while that was going on trying to make sure I didnt miss anything Elo said and my work was being done on time only to stare blankly at that targeting message trying to figure out if I cant read anymore rofl
---
You have that now.  In a wormhole.  Bye.
---
In short no we need to reduce the supply of cheap ore and continuous ore supply. Changing yield is a cock block for everything not rorqual.
---
The real solution that no one wants to admit is kill off the rorq and flip the indy index so more you mine less ore spawns. As "strip" mining is why there is no good ore in HS lore wise.
---
Beyond that nerfing insurance is the next best thing as its still cheaper to rorq mine a freighter then insurance fraud it. Than just build shit amd wait for it on market. Which is beyond fucked up, but thats what the modern rorq ccp made.
---
Must have had good TZ coverage then.
---
All the alliances I've been had a primary TZ, and were almost completely dead outside of that despite any claims to the contrary.
---
If yall are legit playing wow alliance side lmk cause im down
---
/&gt; thinks evicting people is bad
---
/&gt; also thinks evicting people is good

&gt; They'd rather fly across the whole map to fight the same people at someone else's timer

Underrated comment

I'm pretty sure Gobbins is a fairly competent pvp'er - didn't he AT?  
---
I'm also pretty sure Mittens has, and always will be, trash at actually flying the spaceships.
---
what was your cut of the RMT from renting out the dronelands to bots?
---
Caps were dropped on the AAR
---
I agree with you in some ways. I enjoy the big fights but coalitions are breaking up and only growing.
---
I voted, exactly as the state told me too on all my sub’d accounts.  PBUH
---
check pvp pilots instead of PI alts
---
Like have you ever seen Mars Attacks?  I swear seeing elo post about botting was something straight out of the movie.
---
Too true
---
Sadly it needed to be in caps as well
---
Templis is pretty small, and we are constantly recruiting new bros
---
Sad way to go, if I understood this correctly, you are skilling urselves
---
Racism will not be tolerated. C ya SLYCE o7
---
&gt; If ccp don't change things real fucking quick then there's going to be unironic colony collapse disorder in this game, on a scale not seen since phoebe, and probably worse.
---
you blued up everybody around you, rented all your systems to bots, and then go and RMT.  and you are blaming CCP? take a look in the mirror.
---
And I never even got to shoot at you guys. Today sucks.
---
You're all going to play WoW? Well, the average IQ of WoW is about to increase by a good few points...
---
The guy that died to bombs was suicide scramming stork to prevent freedom MJD, the other one (bifrost?) was neuted by the athanor... 
---
Of the 11 bombers in fleet, 1 was flag exempt... so never made the grid, 4 were in the wrong wing and never got the warp. 
---
None of them said anything until after i gave the bomb order.

hh brother see you in another life
---
Okay so this is reported right away but not the fight in Detorid the other day. HOW BIAS CAN YOU BE??
---
I can tell you what it's like in Horde.  I'm sure you'd be welcome.  It's tough when eve sucks.

Lots of targets to shoot, lots of roaming gangs through our area, a ton of small gang pvp if you're into that type of thing.  The occasional big fleet, like once every other day.   Supers used from time to time, unless you get skipped because yo'ure flying an aeon like a moron.  Gobbins has been really cool to deal with.  Lots of very eager newbies willing to try new things.  Kitchen sink fleets turn into real kitchen sink fleets.  Able to kill the occasional roqual with bomber fleets and the CAPF dudes.  Markets are usually stocked, regular supply runs, lots of ratting space, tons of dudes.   About as best as you can hope for, honestly.  One of the closest to jita pvp areas brings a lot of people.  I got a really good bubble off the WH- fight which made it that much better to kill all the expensive stuff at the end there. :)  Some really good dudes on comms, and it's fun helping the new players.

The downside for me is the constant need for ratting for ADMs, just because you have to do PVE to do PVP, I guess. Which really hurts a PVP heavy corp, as they just burn out and drift off.  9 hours of PVE required a week for 3 characters kind of sucks, just to maintain ADMs.  And there is no reason to fight most of the time.  Constant spies because that's all the game is now, can only win by knowing exactly what the enemy is doing.  Get dropped on dudes from time to time, but usually easy to get away from unless it's a friendly (or ex -friendly you forgot to unblue. whoops.)  The usual propaganda wars.

The real problem is CCP and their dedication to this type of game play. Eve is pretty bad right now in a lot of negative ways with zero future state that is looking good.   Citadels are cancer.  They spent a full sprint making something high sec only when high sec is basically dying as well because people can't plex an account due to the income from afk ratting/mining.  As if it wasn't hard enough to get a pvp fight, they have people go into these anomalies that nobody hunts in.  It's just a tough tough spot, which you know better than most.

Bat Country was definitely hurt by our transition to horde, but the guys were basically done anyway, due to choices from CCP.  Several went off to Penif's group, which has been good for them.   A few stay behind in PL, got forced to join Snigg without much choice in the matter, but happy with the outcome.  Hedliner was nice enough to give us our blessing to fold into horde, at least, even with his known disdain for me. The old guys came back from a bit, saw eve was the same, etc.  We did open recruiting for two weeks in game, had one person apply that wanted to join for a week and then leave.  So oh well.  How to go forward, no idea.

I'm reachable on the reddit discord, glad to talk to whomever.  You were always a good dude to me and I liked your FC style.  Best of luck man, I know you'll land on your feet.

If you want specific help more context is needed. PvP and PvE in Eve is so broad and fits differ significantly.
---
For example for PvP is it going to be in null/low/high/wh? Are you flying with a gang or solo? Do you want ships that are kite fit or brawl? Will you have logi? Do you want bling fits or just regular t2 fits?
---
Evenews24 still exists?

Show me these "super loud" spod brains that were supposedly for supers going through ansiblexes.
---
You are talking out your ass.

Agreed with tz tanking, damage caps, and two rf's.... fuck this game. Hopefully ccp fixes something. Id kill to give attackers a way to shift timers by 6-12 hrs and drop the damage caps (or at least cut rf time in half so not so cancerous)
