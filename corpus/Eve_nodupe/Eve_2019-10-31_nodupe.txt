Train those to two or three. You only need those to five if you are planning to do lots of hardcore pvp.

1) don't get greedy and use macks/hulk. Just run pros and skiffs. You'll likely want an Orca and the rest in miners
---
2) This is highly highly highly dependent on skills. Apps such as IPH (Isk per hour) can help you calculate this. [https://eveiph.github.io](https://eveiph.github.io)
---
3) Join a corp, or ninja someone else's belts. A good high sec indy corp these days should be using holding corps for structures.

Hiring more people doesn't necessarily mean things will get done faster or more efficiently in software development.  There is a cost to adding more people to a project, and it can sometimes be a negative value add.
---
citadels, fozzie sov, supercap situation, the relative ease of use, safety and creation of super caps,
---
i mean its super hard and not fun and not worth it
---
It most certainly did not. It is simply absurd to suggest that the designers of what is arguably the biggest, longest-enduring, most complex sandbox universes in existence doesn't put much thought into their rebalancing decisions. It's doubly absurd given that the sub-human who made the remark has probably played the game for years, at least in part due to its ever increasing complexity, stability, and persistence. Even the slightest tweak can have enormous, unpredictable downstream consequences as the change interacts with countless parts moving in a sensitive equillibrium. They cannot fully account for the 10s of thousands of creative, human components who will respond to the change in unpredictable, inventive ways. If they were in the habit of making even the slightest decision haphazardly, we wouldn't be having this conversation right now because the game wouldn't exist.
---
No, there is no legitimate in-game mechanic based reason for it.    It's just for the meme.
---
No one would accept it because "hur dur ccp", but what if they just used this as an opportunity to bait out RMT for some bans later?
---
Its almost like people have been rallying for a super rebalance for years.
---
I agree.
---
Ah, yeah, I did mean claws.
---
&gt; Instead of making the combat ceptor better at the job
---
They are getting a nice damage boost, to be fair.
---
I think reality says otherwise. Any new game definitely needs to be novel or interesting somehow and accept that it might never not be niche.
---
i see....
---
In this sub, it's legitimately hard to tell.
---
&gt; or CCP's sake I hope the Vengeance thing is a typo
---
Probably made the typo, went to correct it, then hit post, and walked off to make some popcorn.
---
Yes! Thank you! You could always count on ChribbaX for some good feels!
---
Ew
---
Golden Dumpster Fire.
---
This seems to be the one thing ccp excels at...
---
You are using the ship incorrectly. It's far too powerful for that type of site.
---
And hope that the defenders dont get to it first
---
Leshaks only do more dps when it comes to drifter. In reality there's not that big of a difference as it takes Leshaks quite a while to spool up
---
A citadel hub location would be better. Anchor a command building, then add to it. You pay additional fuel based on how much you add. You could also join station services into a single docking area, but since CCP made the structures stand alone, I hope you like bashing
---
You know the best part? To paraphrase Hy: "I know out of all the commands Astartes are the most useless and Zarms hardly rep anything, yes this doctrine is shite and can't kill anything, but if we use anything good no one is going to fight us"... And then we leave most of our caps behind too. And take NMs with us for the fights we can't tank, so have to use something kitey and non-commitment. But hey, look, apparently anything we fly is OP and even 2 mids away - is way too close for caps, and 30ish (doubleboxing = 60) SNUFFs is  a mad blob XD
---
It would be best to join an already established corp with players who have experience. Maybe create a private chat channel for you and your friends to chat in. I started off in a newbro highsec corp and it was great. O learnt so much from there.
---
medium shield extender , Damage resist in the mid that corresponds to the damage done by your local rats, More of the same for rigs, orbit the rocks you are mining at a distance that gives you lots of transversal, make sure you are cap stable so you can do it forever, find a belt with battleships or cruisers so they can't hit ya. frigs will hit ya hard enough to be annoying, but you can probably speed tank them too if you can maintain cap stability.
---
Players won't cause another war with the current state. A war is mostly meaningless now anyway. If you want a war, you need something the players can't control that drives it.
---
If you are able to fly tengu you should just do DED sites at that point. You can make much more than 100 mil per hour if you get lucky drops
---
I was thinking more in the context of smaller alliances defending their shit
---
I'd agree that rorqs and supers are pretty much untouchable in delve unless the pilot is a complete idiot or just doesn't tell anyone he's tackled. But that's the power of the super umbrella, I guess. Not gonna change until CCP gets the balls to do something about it in a substantial way.
---
No longer any reason to do a war
---
Remember guys, kill board stats never tell the full story.
---
The kills for bonus concept is easily gamed by alt-killing, so all it really does is create a system that might be economical to shoot your own ships.   
---
The second idea seems complicated to the point of meh and I can't quite picture where I would actually want to deploy it. Stratic ops don't need it, roams can't going to drop it, and krabs have no use for it.
---
I don’t know where to find DED sites. Do they appear in null sec?
---
&gt; non boosting time doesn't really exist
---
Depends entirely how stoned the booster is
---
Seriously. What a fucking retard.
---
it's dying because a less than charismatic CEO failed to retain key employees that served as linchpins in various different areas of development. add to that a very limited talent pool and employment desirability because iceland is.. iceland... most cant even pronounce the city eve was founded in much less want to move there. of course its easy to criticize in hind sight and without having had to endure any of the pressure at all of those decisions..  but yea, shitty management, shit working conditions, leads to overall crap performance

No, your burnt out FC's did.

i'd take it as web over a grappler any day, since the web bonus on hulls like the Bhaal or Vindi doesn't apply to grapplers.
---
There's a lot of long posts here. I'll try to keep it simple for you, related to what you stated directly.
---
You can do a crapton with 3 people. If you're interested in mining and industry, you can get a lot more money from it out in nullsec.
---
If you don't know what nullsec is, feel free to ask!
---
My recommendation? Do some mining in highsec. Build up stocks of at least 5 million ISK each. 
---
Learn exploration. I can send you fits in game. Go to systems in highsec that are empty, and start exploring. Look for wormholes. Look for Relic sites in those wormholes.
---
You'll get at least 20m ISK per relic site, and up to 150m+ in good ones.
---
Then head to nullsec. If you want to get straight into good mining and industrialization, then pack up right now and take the three of you out to 6NJ8-V. There's a bunch of us out here trying to build something brand new, a new trade hub in Guristas space
---
Isnt that what reddit is for?
---
I mean, there's also the elephant in the room in that CCP has made sov system so utterly cancer that nobody in their right mind wants to take part in it.  But sure, it's all on the players.
---
booshers did nothing wrong
---
If you cant head and cycle your mwd in the 7-8 sec it takes from the moment it uncloaks to the moment it targets you. You deserve to die
---
Well yeah, but a large part of that is because of the fozziecitadelsovmechanics.  This is what happens when you break shit and don't actually improve it for literal years.  Now its probably beyond fixing.  A consequence of having a dev cycle that's like 2 turtles having intercourse.

How to really win EVE
---
Can i ask why you do it this way... i feel it leads to so much dev work trying to work out what ship does what at a base stats level and then having bonuses ontop of that with module bonuses and then player skill level ontop of this. Its mathematics gone mental.
---
Why not give each class of ship a base stat for Hull, Armour, Shield, Speed, Tracking and no DPS.
---
You then add a bonus to the ship class at a basic level. Example would be Assualt Frigate get Access to Assualt Damage Control and a bonus to signiture radios for Afterburner.
---
You then give bonuses per player skill level to normal things like speed, DPS, Armour, Shield, Hull, Capacitor and Powergrid.
---
This will mean you only tweak the bonuses if the ship is to strong at a ship level or at a ship class level rather than having to tweak base numbers.
---
With development when using a framework you never touch the core code. It allows you to update faster and with no issues when there is a update. Not effecting the core part of the ship also means any core updates or tweaks means you dont have issues going forward.
---
Im using a mobile so sorry if not making 100% sense.
---
Oh just go. EVE doesn't need another play-date of a war. It needs a REASON to have a war. A good one. There's so much of this "war for the sake of something to do" that nobody even cares enough to look at them anymore.
---
Absolutely not. It happened because second strongest side has no ambition and blued up to the strongest side + everyone they can. Third strongest side simply cant take them on. 
---
CCP can change mechanics all the time, but they can change someone, whose outlook in life and ambition is to be a pussy to the top dawg.
---
Tim nering made r3dfire and then joined forces with jenk corp to make the gayest corp in eve that I'm now a part of.
---
Thanks for the good fights Snuff!
---
You need to be at the right place at the right time.  
---
 I know one system that is "held" by a small WH Corp without any blues in the neighborhood.   
---
OK, as far as I know it was never contested and they don't use this space (besides to be able to joke about that they are a SOV holding corp)
---
u should post with a better flair next time friend ;)
---
&gt;The highsec trap of mining and running missions ad nauseum is real. The npe really needs ways to promote other playstyles from the get go.
---
Instead they keep remaking this same 1-hour beginning block over and over again while having the same problem of dropping you into the old mission/mining crap.  The fact they still haven't understood this is such a huge problem, after all this time and people telling them as much, kills any hope I have of them ever understanding it.
---
I don't think you understand how fast it used to be.
---
I found some 2014 videos on my hard drive a few months ago, it was 2 or 3 seconds, you'd log in and the 10s session timer top left was still cycling pretty much every time. I can't remember the last time I saw that.
---
takes at most 10 seconds for me and the game doesn't freeze, it just doesn't have a loading animation (ie, turns to black)
---

---
So I get downvoted because I dont know what the purpose of this? I'm actually being serious, whats the reason behind it? why is it a thing? Whats the purpose for it?
---
Sure. I've been playing since beta and I still watch them. Good luck
---
get me out
---
Lol! RMT!
---
You should probably try to do everything in the beginning to learn the game. I would recommend making an alt so you can skill into different things but it's not required. Exploration is probably the most lucrative (but a lot of people don't like doing it) to do in the beginning and the skills and knowledge might be good if you decided to try moving into more dangerous space later.
---
We made it to Steve!!!! awesome job
---
The were the best :v
---
Why would you do this I mean why pad? I really don't understand why anyone needs to alter their stats on a kill board! wierd behavier in my opinion.
---
Just won't happen. 
---
If you're a conflict driving alliance leader CCP will ban you.
---
Bullshit, players want war but don't have any reason that warrants the mountains of effort required.
---
Really, I haven’t heard that? But if we’ll believe it’s true
---
Everything you just wrote is working as intended.
---
&gt;I am having problems changing from the orbit view to the free camera, everytime I do, the camera shoots off into the distance from my original position 
---
You have auto-tracking enabled, right click on the orbit camera button so you get [this](https://i.imgur.com/iG3A6jg.png)  drop down menu, click the option so you end up with an icon that looks like [this](https://i.imgur.com/g1Lsudf.png) 
---
Also, use the tactical camera this is the most useful one and make sure to use the tactical overlay which is probably the most useful of the camera options. 
---
&gt; but if that thing warps off then the camera get sent back to my ship
---
That's a game mechanic, when a ship enters warp you lose the ability to 'look at' but you can track them and the camera will snap back when they leave gird.
---
&gt; but the free cam has an issue when you zoom around it moves really far, unlike the tracking an object mode where you zoon in and out slower,  
---
This just sounds like an issue because you are using a trackpad, the controls can be a bit complicated at first but once you wrap your head around them it will become second nature.
---
TLDR use tactical camera + overlay and get a fricken mouse, ur life will be x10 easier.
---
You have my axe!
---
It would be OP in fw against brawlers. Als the fitting additions arent remotely enough for combat ceptors. I still think they are underperforming and now assault frigs again are smaller cruisers
---
Thank you so much!
---
It won't but to speed up with 100mn takes a while. Your most likely scram/webbed as well and that should give a Proteus some time to apply some of its dps.
---
If you dont use this icon....I will be offended.  [https://t4.rbxcdn.com/b13cb210a594ef5a1364116c7223d6ea](https://t4.rbxcdn.com/b13cb210a594ef5a1364116c7223d6ea)

&gt;A public discord server isn't a private residence. It's more akin to the sidewalk in front of someone's house.
---
Completely and utterly incorrect. A "public" discord server is still owned by a private entity. The sidewalk in front of someone's house is owned by the government and by extension is expected to be public for all of the citizens to make use of.
---
Their property, their rules if you want to be on/in their property. your rights don't extend to negate other people's rights over their things.
---
I'm surprised no one has mentioned this.
---
Check out wormholes. You can stay in high sec, scan a few systems either way, hop in and see if that wormhole has an asteroid belt. Quite a few wormhole belts will have all the ores you need, including null sec ones like mercoxit and arkonor. 
---
I would highly recommend using a mining frigste. Pay attention to d-scan since you don't have local and don't be surprised if you get piopped by wandering wormholers.
---
I'll take what are webs for 100
---
also for obvious RMT
---
Everyone that matters at pvp would prefer to see an T1 vs T1 kill than this bullshit. He is not killboard padding he is murdering his account by getting excluded from all the real PvP groups. Gj grandpa.

an officer point on lets say a ceptor is much more viable then lets say on a big slow battleship. The risk vs reward on a ceptor far better than on a bs. just my thoughts on that

Goons already did it to earn more FW LP. It's very easy to manipulate the market on some shitty items like autotarget modules or something.

So I used to do solo wh ganking/adventures, sometimes I would multi-box. More frequently I would leave 1-2 chars in my home wh and then have 1-2 scouts and 1 combat char out. I sympathize with your plight, and with your target selection dilemma. One of the reasons I 'won' Eve was that I felt it had become too hard to find acceptable odd fights solo in LS or WH in a tech 3 cruiser.
---
Even with a bling fit you might lose 1v1 to a bling Stratios. You're stuck flying a Ninja Loki, which can almost always run away, but loses the ability to brawl down a lot of mid-sized ships that you could brawl down in a Tengu/Prot (fair trade off imo, 1 ship shouldn't have gtfo 100mn run + great brawling).
---
The thing that finally killed this playstyle for me, and if I came back I would probably use only Stealthbombers set up for solo, was that too many of the small ships are impossible to lock unless the target is afk. The big ships are fun fights, but very chancy because anything that takes 2-3 minutes to brawl down means their friends can show up. But you can't lock an astero or many other frig before they can warp away.
---
All of that said, I loaded and patched Pyfa before checking current fits for Prot, HAMGu and HeavyGu. I think active rep Proteus is fine, so long as you never face a medium neut. However, if you're willing to play the bling game (I did this with 1.5b ships and 1-2b pods) you can still squeeze some crazy tank and good dps out of both ships.
---
Anyone want to see the kill - https://clips.twitch.tv/OriginalNastyRatUWot
---
ah man I wish I was that clever.... https://imgur.com/a/OoKJ7uh
---
Yeah. it was slow because the tank had to be armor due to anemic mids. But then you were investing into plates and nanofibers which made no sense. The alternative was you would take nanofibers and an active tank and use cap batteries or injectors to stay stable but you had such little armor you'd get punched clean through. Also, for the railgun fit, I played around with web drones on it so that I could elevate my application. It actually was a good idea because the slow was worth more than the DPS because you didn't invest into the drone dps with a DDA.
---
There was just no combination of weapon type / tank / mobility / utility that felt good. You need some of all four to meaningfully hunt in nullsec, and any fit on the proteus was giving up one of those things almost completely or compromising it in an unacceptable way. That's my change my mind for this post.
---
No way, who dat boi most definitely better as intro
---
this screams for exploit, try to change my mind (and don't use something like averaging) ... 
---
this could !at best! be viable for NPC kills where bountys would be awarded 100% to each member of a fleet instead of dropping loot or something
---
What if we introduced a new specialized interceptor-only module that functions as a MWD normally but turns into an AB if you get scrammed (call it an Interceptor Adaptive Propulsion or something like that). It would give interceptors a built in dual-prop so that they can enter scram range without killing themselves while at the same time not being completely uncatchable.
---
If a "line member" wants greater meaning from a fight they should leave their corp/alliance and join one where their contribution to any given fight is more meaningful.
---
For the record I have both a ticket (987332) and a bug report (EBR-184430) in since this is likely to mess up a lot of people who had planned ahead based upon the original attribute. Yes, I know the description says `The compounds are only guaranteed to function until YC121/11/01.` - that wording could have multiple meanings, but the attribute value is king when it comes to things like this. IIRC they normally expire at downtime regardless, since the first few and the confusion they caused with 00:00 expiration, so no matter what this comes off as a sneaky and unwelcome move. *(Also, yes I'm aware that typically filing both a bug report and a ticket are frowned upon, but this is one of the few cases where it seems to actually be the sensible decision, and I only mention that openly in case this gets seen by someone at CCP before the ticket/BR do, for ease of correlation.)*

Providence has always been about NRDS. However not all of Providence is NRDS anymore with the invasion of HTP, TRC, and PHEW. You all are failing at your mission objective as stated by your overlords, CVA. You all had content with spectre fleet daily roams and other things going on all the time before them. Maybe you forgot.

It's two different deals: one for 3+ months at 10% discount, and another at full price with a discount for an equal amount of MCT time.

I tried to do that to answer his question and the results were not very clear. When I went to click download it only was like 65 MB and that definitely is not the file size of EVE. I have also heard that the game only downloads part of the file until you do an action that requests the game to download other files.
---
PA's only direction is "send $$ tnx"
---
CCP recommends 20GB. I have read the whole game is anywhere between 2GB and 14GB. Sorry I can't help more
---
Drone sites have alot of smaller rats with a small signature radius which means missiles have a hard time applying the damage.

Could be, but the only 'native' bird to Wake Island--the Wake Island Rail-- went extinct during the Second World War, when we Americans blockaded the Japanese occupation force and let the 4 thousand or so Imperial Japanese soldiers that Japan managed to squeeze onto the island starve. 
---
Fake Edit
---
I looked it up, and while, yes Wake Island is now a national wild life reserve, there are up to 100 USAF personnel based there at any one time. I believe they must have a ballistic missile interception battery placed there, but its probably super top secret.
---
Know CCP it’d be a Trig exclusive Interdictor. Mutadaptive Interdiction Gas Launcher. It releases spheres of the abyssal gas with their effects. It costs abyss materials to use.

---
Inhibitors
---
is that a video from 2009 ?
---
Speaking of trig ships... they really need to be balanced. Like the kiki wtf..
---
The main weakness of trigs are they require continuous locks to achieve max dps but they have really good stats when it comes to sensors. Personally i would reduce sensors on the kiki as an example to 8. This would enhance the usefulness of ewar as a hard counter to trigs.
---
I love 50mn torms
---
The real kicker for me here is that the expiration date wrt the redeeming window gave a date in February.
---
I am all for items having an expiration date and remaining as souvenirs/scam items... but having them expire in the redeeming queue long before the expiration listed there violates the principle of least surprise.
---
i just skill queued Amarr Frigates just to fly the Tormentor. Great post!
---
yeah doesn't surprise me tbh. a look through the char's losses says it all... too much irl isk, too little brains. Kicking him won't be much of a loss tbh
---
From what's I've heard that type of activity is pretty dead since you lose a recon if you whiff, and because of how docking works, you whiff a lot before catching one.

Is this you killing your alt to pad your KB?
---
Test and Goons are not blue, and haven't been for at least all of 2019 I think. We were literally in Goon space last night shooting at them, and they do it to us.
---
There were times we operated independently from Goons against Frat/PH/WinterCo during the recent war, and would try to avoid shooting each other during a single engagement. But we were never blue and were never not shooting them outside of these few cases.
---
I'm glad I could provide some entertainment

---
&gt; Big blocks losing competent FCs and PvPers to boredom from too many blues has been an effective block-killer in the past. Enable the latter if you want to see mega-alliances collapse sooner.
---
There's a reason Imperium lives in Delve and Init in Fountain, both regions where you can hit all of the space from the NPC constellation. Opposition and interactivity keeps people engaged in the game. My evenings would be a bit less fun if I couldn't drop my super on Mar5hy whenever he pops some shitfit Rorqual.
---
Lol
---
Bots overcome that restriction easily. They can't, however, fly ships on alpha accounts that alphas can't fly.
---
A lot of the alpha restrictions come down to combating bots. For obvious reasons.
---
so basically some toxic kid decided to shit all over the place
---
[removed]
---
Jump fatigue was introduced because high mobility was oppressive and problematic. People whined and complained and then accepted that things are probably better as a result. Now we have this slow steady creep back towards a game where there are no consequences for poor deployment, for all the reasons mentioned above. So I completely agree that something needs to be done to bring that back into balance.
---
I'll disagree on resource depletion being ineffective, though. If the system rewards smaller mining fleets spread out across multiple constellations, the umbrellas will have a harder time providing coverage.
---
Realistically, any time a titan phenom is running, all titan phenoms are running. Because both super fleets with have them up.
---
We can't be not blue and also not engaging in sov warfare? Because that's like... what most alliances do most of the time. Sov warfare is tiring. Shooting each other in roaming gangs is fun.
