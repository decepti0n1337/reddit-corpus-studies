probably because Meiqur is on eve holiday. I did expect a smug Reddit post from him. but i tried to tell radioactive not to be so dramatic its just one of those swings one side or the other happens to hit.

stop bombing yourself

Double check your spam folders and make sure the email didn't end up there. After that think back - did you unsubscribe from EVE Online emails at some point this year? If not check out the [dev blog](https://www.eveonline.com/article/q3cdqi/your-year-in-eve-video-data) and make sure there's nothing else there that might have disqualified you.
---

---
If after all that you still think you should have received something then... I'm sorry. :/ For whatever reason you didn't get a video. We tried super hard not to exclude anyone who was really working hard in EVE this year but with over 200,000 emails sent there might have been a few people who slipped through the cracks. I hope we can do better for you next year.

Intel thread lol

Great idea.... EXcePt h0w FucKiNG AnnoYing iT wAs!!!

This was really awesome to see. A shame that I got the PvP reward instead of PvE because I am a total mission runner carebear, but attended a lot of Bombers Bar fleets. Still though, a lot of fun to watch and the stats were great.
---
check your spam folder, Jin'taan's got sent there. That is if you met the criteria
---
Top 25%. You have to be mad active dude
---
Yeah, I think I logged in like &lt;20 times this year lmao
---
no, never, not ever....
---
The EVE equivalent of shooting the hostage. Keanu would be proud.
---
Which racial cruiser should I train to V next? I got Gallente cruiser to V a couple of years ago in preparation for flying a Proteus but then left eve for a while. Apparently it's shit now so I don't think there's a point in training the rest of the Gallente T3C skills. 
---
The Loki seems to be the most versatile T3C at the moment (correct me if I'm wrong), so I'm leaning towards training Minmatar cruisers next. On the other hand, Amarr has some damn sexy ships...
---
What are some currently commonly used T2 cruisers that I might want to keep in mind beyond the T3Cs?
---
That's amazing! Hope you feel better soon and also play EVE some more. ;)
---
Lol, cause that would make it way better!!!! Not.
---
LOL not much incentive there to not answer yes  LOL
---
You can certainly PVP, but if you solo with newbie skills you are likely to lose the vast majority of fights you take.

Holy shit

I've been two weeks from a Nid for the past 4-6 months. My plan is to commit in 2020. This would be my first cap.

And try a rorqual.

---
For some reason i've found that it tries to set the station as some other station than the on you are docked at.
---
Gotta change the input location on the top right of the Indy window to tell it where to pull the materials from
---
No love for logi pilots
---
I had [this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/554197500890710038/661364730023247872/image0.png) and [this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/554197500890710038/661364854749134863/image0.png) which adds up to 43B of Planetary Production materials. Who can top it?!
---
At least they're not afraid to use their ships.
---
what i said in OP: it isn't totally a matter of introducing new mechanics, EVE is already rife with it. it's a matter of changing numbers so that *not* spending real money is hugely inconvenient. (see: BDO, or any other eastern MMO)
---
Bold of you to assume I have no experience with null block lifestyle.
---
One alt got a video and it said zero pods. I died in an abyss several times.
---
&lt;3
---
Orange is the new blue?
---
Ppl plexing their account with isk is more profitable for CCP than ppl buying subscriptions. Plex is decided by how many players want to spend money on the game versus how many want to completely be in-game sustained.
---
He's 15, man.
---
yeah, i realized after that the station i was docked at didnt have indy lol
---
I have the minerals, but eve says they dont exist
---
Ooooff was by so long!?
---
gr
---
I hope to see this become a yearly thing.
---
I would also like an official stat page from CCP. Sure it's intel but you would have to log in it with your own account and only you could see it.
---
Why? Because we all like stats. And graphs!

&gt;Players that received ‘DAILY DOWNTIME?’ as their nemesis had never been killed by another player during the tracked time period.
---
Also structures were my victims. Even I haven't killed many structures this year. Probably two? But that probably means all my victims have been different, and structures were the only thing that I had more than one.

I just started and everyone is bullying me. What do I do
---
i think what’s really frowned upon is killing the game by nipping every group that could actually threaten you.  but what do i know, im just some nobody according to you :)
---
But mittani..
---
And 3 wives...
---
Just because I don't know who you are doesn't mean you don't matter; everybody matters.  I'm sorry you don't see the value an alliance like TEST offers to the game but I truly believe that if I suicided TEST tomorrow all that would happen is there would be 4 major powers instead of 5, and I think the game would be in a worse off place than it is today.
---
Not at all... you can have a blast in low sec with tech 1 frigates. You will die a lot, but if you keep 5-6 spare ships in a nearby station you’ll have tons of fun.
---
Needs more boson to fire on havens.
---
Fc orders &gt; pretty colors
---
If you'd check the videos he's been being introduced to low-sec and null-sec slowly by some of his followers. The only thing he has spent real money on is stuff to give away in his stream. Stuff such as skins, Omega, etc.
---
Sucks for the FC i aint got no guns HAHAHA. IM A CRUCI PILOT &lt;/3
---
3 MILs :(
---
I noticed one of these... :( 
---
 So here take this... :D
---
I can just see an fc, shoot that logi, now their other logi, now our friendly tackle, back to their logi!
---
Respectfully, we didnt go anywhere for anything lol. We live in direct bridge range of provi and have done for more than half a decade (we used to live in Khanid lowsec, but it dried up years ago and couldnt give us the content we wanted.
---
We fight provi outnumbered because its fun and convenient, RC is not at war with Provi and we have never been; you are just our sparring partner. It may be a war for Provi, but none of RC see it that way.
---
Sometimes our antics go well, sometimes we get blobbed (like today) and lose a few ships. The reason this thread faceplanted is simply because in order to smugpost in a public forum, what you're smugposting about must be worth being smug about. 
---
I have no problem dragging my nutsack up and down some faces whilst pointing it out, and neither does the rest of r/EVE. Its all about perspective, on which OP has less grasp than i thought. (tbh i actually like Twi, he's a good CEO and a nice dude, but looks like provi koolaid got to him).
---
"We hate you, but NIP is NIP"
---
Great idea, guys. Watching it over and over again. :)

did that legit happen? lol

The  [**/characters/{character\_id}/stats**](https://esi.evetech.net/ui/#/operations/Character/get_characters_character_id_stats) ESI endpoint exposes  `activations_cynosural_field`
---
Please. Please give me a reason to play again so I can burn test to the ground.
---
sounds like you should have planned better idiot.  IF FC SAYS SHOOT AND YOU CANT SHOOT YOU'RE FUCKING UP SON.
---
Cause all of these so called "Wars" are staged safely inside the "EvE OnLiNe MeGa Fc ChaNnEl" on jabber
---
yes, you "can" although you will be at a significant sp and knowledge disadvantage which usually means you'll die a lot. pvp in eve is a game of information more than it is of skill points but being new also means you don't know a lot yet. here's a video of a very good pvp-er using a 20 day old character https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvOB4KXYk-o&amp;t=2s. that channel in general has a lot of great pvp related information and even if some of the videos are old the concepts are still largely relevant.
---
I figure it's prob at the bottom of the pile for PvP. Just puts me above the 4/5s that don't do PvP xD
---
We don't consider you pot-shotting ansiblexes with 10 muninns to be worth forming an actual fleet for... v0v no mad m8

Get a life?
---
Why do some of these "your year in eve" videos have hundreds of alts?  How does that even work?  Are they all Omega?  Why would anyone even need that many alts?  How would you manage such a pile of toons?  There's no way people actually log into all those alts on a regular basis, right?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/ehs79b/these_videos_are_awesome_thanks_ccp/fcldnif
---
Ow damn, that sounds real good
---
Are there any more details about how the "main" character gets chosen? I'm working with some directors that are looking at implementing a system that requires players to submit these videos to weed out spies in our alliance. The plan is that this system will even be made available to other corporations and alliances when it is operational!
---
I had no idea what the email was and it was such a great surprise. They knocked it out of the park with this.
---
That's a bad example, the video is still available

I gained 53mil so on my main toon this year....
---
I think mainly because I made so much money that I could buy a large injector nearly every day for a few months over the summer (started playimg last November)
---
Welp more battleships solo in Tama.
---
Also find a fun Corp to play with and stop welping solo.
---
It is true, the system names where they rat and mine in have many differences not just in letters, but even in numbers! You can easily tell Braweswarm Horde apart from Northern Test Fraternity just by looking at the map.
---
Imagine not even being top 1% in kills, smh
---
Fuzzworks has the ore compression calculator.

Well, it's based on lowest m3, not on anything else.

Bragful brag: https://pasteboard.co/INMVsz3.png

That's some good nerd murder amigos.
---
Man I would literally give a huge thanks to whoever comes up with something that sifts through my hoard of materials and blueprints and tells me what can I build with the least amount of extra resources.
---
Yeah saw CCP Convict talking about this, CCP own the actual music so are trying to figure that shit out.
---
Are you sure players won't quit if they try to make those?
---
3.6m per Plex.
---
1.7b for 500 for one month.
---
Not only will it build Nyxes but it will make them levitate freely in a gravity well and then hide all of the evidence.
---
Very few things are totally better than real life work.
---
some like it raw.

Other like it burnt.
---
how do you draw these every day an never improve? its impressive
---
Doing Bob's work, Bless you son
---
at least you take it well
---
CCP please do not allow this sociopath back in the game. Good riddance. 
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
What can i do when i met the criteria but still didnt get a video ?
---
Yep.
---
Optimizing for 2 different things is significantly more complex. As that produces a curve, rather than a point.
---
If you want to restrict extra materials, you have to use the restriction values, rather than leaving them as -1 (no restrictions)
---
Silly rabbit trix are for kids.
---
Youtube Rewind??? Is that the same thing??? I already know i watch too much LTT and random ass rabbit holes.
---
That's why he has a darwinism flair
---
He farms the SP
---
Yeah, telling your most expensive ships to get save from a fight turning bad is such a baaaaad strategic decision. Shame on Killah Bee.
---
You think those 5k chars were all people? I pity you.
---
I feel like Eve is the front end of something where we are doing some kind of data processing for profit, or AI training like you said.
---
Apparently some snowflakes don't know how to appreciate your honesty.
---
I guess there are different kind of snowflakes ;)
---
What good is 236 alts if you didn't do 140k jumps in them tho?
---
You need fo lay off the kool-aid as I think its affecting your brain.
---
&gt; Knowledge is power in eve more than sp and isk
---
And you just had to start with a blatant lie.
---
No knowledge in the known universe would let you beat an SP advantage in eve, stop lying to newbies already. Entire combat system in eve is zero-depth "bigger SP wins" thing, no amount of ISK will give so much combat boost as reaching a minimum pvp requirement of 70-80 million SP would.
---
The tax on plex is the sink
---
It actually would be very cool if there was a link when you can check your video(or info that you did not get one). Like _eve-site/account/video2019_
---
And yes, I liked mine, too bad that my worst nemesis is myself... Not far from truth though.
---
Is a company (fixed it for you)

reminds me a lot of goonswarm

Jokes on you nerd we don't have renters

They fed faction battleships to TEST

Or if we're only talking about victories, then I can't help you tbh

USE TACTICAL OVERLAY REE
---
I am sorry sir, but you do not appear to be salty or bitter enough for participating in this subreddit. 
---
Also, you missed the perfect chance to reply with "So does your mom".
---
What makes a system have "Good" PI? I'm in a wormhole, and the corp says it doesn't have good PI, but another hole does? IS it the variety of materials?
---
" and no reason to use them. Other then the occasional kick of provi block. " 
---
Might wanna get your misinformation straightened out. It's papa pandafam that has to make up excuses and npsi groups to attack provi for morale. When we want to punch below our weight class for an easy win we punch the north.  Not the "little guy."
---
" why wont they fight us? " 
---
This reddit fantasy of what we say is quite poor.  What we really wonder is. Why did they bother?  How do they still have morale after we out formed their all day hurf blurf fleet in one ping and they were forced to stand down?  Did they really think they could get away with that?  Why do they come to delve if they aren't ready to become killmarks? Why are they so salty? Why can't they make any intresting grr goons narratives besides waaahhhh it's not fair!
---
" Let the subcaps brawl take risks losing is not a bad thing you learn from it as you know. " " Can we all just leave the supers and titans at home for a bit? "
---
 Just like the last 5000 times we tried that. They responded by bringing supers and titans to fight our subcaps. So.... Get over it.
---
No
---
When TF did Horde even bother Provi this year?  We answered the HTP batphone for a few big timers like the Camal keepstar but there's been no campaign against you like you're carrying on about.
---
This is not eve related.
---
so I usually do, but sometimes I have a CPU/GPU overlay and the keyboard shortcut for that is the same for the tactical overlay.  It bugs the hell outa me.
---
Remind me of the last time any of the major alliances in this game has done anything on their own? The last thing that comes to my mind is SkillU evicting Tri (rip and rip), before that was SkillU evicting DRF and before that i can't even remember any meaningful war that wasn't on a coalition level. That's how long it has been...
---
accurate
---
Still dont know how the up  and down votes work lol and I m placing a new feed for the manuscript I shouldn't call it a book or a story since it's still a work in progress.ill send it to you so you dont have to be so critical.
---
Wondered when this was going to get posted.  That was a blast, honestly the reship to smaller stuff with tracking disruptors was a good call.
---
At the end we decided to drive the dreads in opposite directions and see who could make it off the field.
---
Was super fun to have an extended fight like that.
---
I thought it said shit post at first and was like this is actually pretty cool 😥
---
Thanks. That'll save me a lot of trouble. I was getting a lot of wormholes and was actually just starting to wonder if it was worth it to scan them all down or just move on to different WH space.

Your end result is dependent on many variables including print speed and layer height. You would need to use primer filler then send and primer again. This is before that last layer of primer. Orientation is important too for ship models which I am about to make a post about too.
---
echo's is ok right now. not seeing any bugs. it's EVE dumbed down essentially. so far a treat to play for an hour or so on mobile.

I can’t tell you without market info and the planet types. Probably just figure out what level you want to get to, then figure out yield per thing, and what has the best yield to profit.
---
Valkyrie got updated with Warzone to add new modes and ships. But it also introduced weird gameplay decisions like a focus on Ultimate abilities. There is basically no organic playerbase anymore, you need Discord to organize scrims if you don't want to play against bots.
---
Echoes is coming along really well. Has a lot of issues but it's basically EVE in your pocket. Lots of missing features, but also lots of QOL improvements. Graphics and controls are great. It DESTROYS your phone/tablet battery.

Please tell me that you play a tabletop version of Eve
