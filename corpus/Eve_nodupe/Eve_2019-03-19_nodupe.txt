What would be funny is only showing one excavator per rock. Like it blocks all else from locking. You need some law... Maybe it creates a disturbance that disrupts other ships /drones

I came to the shocking realization that I was unimaginably fucking gay
---
That’s just plain economics. You look at the massive increase in demand for PLEX due to injectors and hugely scalable Rorqual mining/ super ratting
---

---
Both Rorquals and Super PVE create vastly more resources, which in turn devalues those resources. Normally, that is good. Look at ship prices which have dropped heavily due to increased production.
---
But PLEX is not a normal commodity. It cannot be generates through in game activities. PLEX doesn’t magically appear. It has to be injected into the game via actual spending of real currency. Currency that is earned through real work. No amount of super ratting or rorqual mining is going to make plex appear from thin air.
---
Then on the other side you look at the fact that this supply hasn’t really gone up.
---
If more people are incentivized to not PLEX for ISK and instead just super rat (I know I did, it was massively profitable) then in the long run you will see huge pressure on PLEX.
---
In addition, PLEX represents an act of investment in the game. You’re paying real money hoping that the investment will bring you more enjoyment. To do that requires confidence.
---
And customer confidence is affected by the decisions of the company. If the company is making questionable decisions, it will more heavily influence those spending real money as it is a more tangible loss over space pixels.
---
A short term solution would be a PLEX sale to alleviate prices. That however won’t solve anything, because it doesn’t do anything about the insane demand and incentivized further scaling. To tackle the surplus of isk requires drastic and lasting measures which reduces overall income and shuts down scalability. It has to tackle the need for demand.
---
That would create a whole other set of issues, because now you have a whole bunch of characters generated by SP and injectors floating around, which just became obsolete as scalability is no longer a thing.
---
CCP really screwed the pooch on this one.
---
NGL, I’d pucker up and think of England if it got me a Sabre BPO.
---
Gotta keep the swag on the fleet. ;-)

Sorry to break this to you like this, but you are also pwned.

Dude, got Noah on the blower, yeah the boat guy, says he wants his PC back. 
---
I want to gamble my current ship away.
---
Please stay on topic next time, have a nice day.
---
it's kinda slow on a SSD too, that's what happens when you move 80k files. dealing with lots of small files has a lot of filesystem overhead.
---
also SSDs are under $40 these days, they're the best bang-buck improvement you can make to your PC.
---
If fit with a full flight of warriors and RLML's would this upgrade make the ship more suitable for anti-frig/desi's?
---
Better than it is now? Marginally. The issue with relying on drones to kill frigates/dessies is:
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
1. Drones can be destroyed, which then brings you back to all the same issues the CNI has now
---
2. They are "paper" dps, meaning you see them on your ship as dps and in Pyfa/EFT etc, but in reality, you're waiting for them to fly to a target and then also apply to that target, the actual dps from drones is less than on "paper".
---
3. This is part of #2, but important due to your question, against kitey frigs, its possible they can just outrun your drones, and since the CNI doesn't have range bonuses on RLML like the T1 Caracal (or Nosprey), they can potentially even outrun your missiles, which means you have gained 0 help from them adding 25m3 of drone space
---
My perfect cap alts don't need to train skills, so extracting makes that account almost free. Rinse and repeat, and you have people losing isk every month, but less than usual 
---
Bots... bots everywhere.... 
---
I enjoy ratting the most. But any type of ratting I do doesn’t come clean to fueling my tastes. Maybe I’m doing it wrong
---
HAH!
---
Ackchyually Casino War Two

You mean the freeport that was suddenly not a freeport?  That was fun times lol
---
B-b-but muh can flipping!
---
Damn I liquidated in multiple steps until i ran out of plex. Was way to early apperently.
---
time to update your tetanus shot
---
In delve you only need a working microphone, be in fleet, be on coms and have a cyno with LO and you can't die, yet you see super die all the day there 
---
So what will it take for CCP to "fix" injectors?
---
67M a day is a decent chunk of ISK. Could fit a couple PvP cruisers for it. Not to mention that you need to keep logging in and doing something EVERY DAY to keep it at the manageable level.
---
If I have a job and family to be with, I'm probably only going to have the weekend to play, which means 500M every weekend just to PLEX one account. Even with some of the best ISK/h activities that's two hours of grinding for ISK. Granted, if I have a job I might as well pay for the subscription, but the prices for PLEX are getting out of hand for how much grind is required to get one even at end-game ISK making activities.
---
Hi, me and my friends burned out on br's too. Now we run around with our dongs out in rust and Conan lol
---
15 hours of incursions is the go-to recipe for Eve burnout. It takes a very special kind of person to be able to put up with the comms, the entitled FCs, and the dreary repetitiveness of flying incursions for hours on end.
---
I honestly couldn't believe they didn't touch the jag during the up-coming patch it basically makes all EM damage ships obsolete in areas in where they are used often. E.g. horde space. Their tank is ridiculous they are far too fast and basically ruin the fight when kiting, unless you're in something which can stop it from ramming or are snaked and faster than it. Good post 100% agree with it :). I do miss the slicer meta before the AF meta things were so much simpler
---
Walking in spaceships is my dream game.
---
shut up lol
---
this is just hilarious to me. even when walking in stations existed you couldn't justify buying these, and they keep making new ones after WiS is removed??
---
Who is mad? I’m still trying to find these mad goodies so if you could name and shame them it would be greatly appreciated!
---
Free market, peeps.
---
So you are aware a DST can fit like 66,400 m3 while an orca can fit 260,875m3 so you would need to remove the dst ro a station 4 times for every 1 station trip with the orca
---
PLEX prices aren't getting out of hand, it's simply that your methods of making ISK aren't competitive enough these days.
---
For most people the most efficient method to pay for a subscription is real life work (vs their idea of earning ISK). If you want to save time and real money then you've gotta play smart, not hard like the rest of the rat racers.
---
Restrict what the sp can be applied to
---
Hahahahaha imagine a Grath fleet engaging hostiles who were neutral to diamond rats.
---
So your upset about people plexing their alts and thus driving up the price of plex
---
And if skill injectors didn’t exist, it would be hard to have so many alts?
---
jesus fuck you just don't get it do you?

Can confirm this is true. I spent 500mil on my shoes for my main...
---
The in game channel is Public Karma now. Thanks for linking this goldmine of info!

i 2nd the "solor battleships in FW lowsec." 
---
This is a pretty good question. I would love to see how plex is affected in different regions and which alliances are in those regions. 
---
Don't forget how many people have and are getting turned off from the game cause of all this multiboxing bullshit. Not to mention it further contributed to major issues in the game such as cap proliferation etc. and on top of that, while not the only factor, it is a major part of what has become a breeding ground for bots.
---
There is really nothing but bad shit. Some multiboxing is OK, but when it gets so out of whack it destroys the game for everyone else and eventually the multiboxers themselves too as the plex supply and huge chunk of person to person interaction instead of person to AFK account or bot, disappear from the game.
---
But what will it take for us to get there? Because right now, it seems CCP doesnt get it.
---
Stiletto is still by far the best pure null-sec exploration platform possible. But I personally prefer the Astero for the PVE/PVP mix.
---
Who upvoted this man?????
---
But also add 5 drones, make CNI great boys
---
Doing PI tops out at 500M/month per account and locks down one of your characters at the minimum for hauling duty. Incursions top out at 200M/h, need a big up-front investment and are mind-numbingly boring. Ratting can range from 60M/h in VNI to 300M/h in a super, but again, very few can rat in supers. Mining is mind-numbingly boring even if you 'risk' a Rorq.
---
If we also consider the luck-based activities like anom running and abyssal farming, those activities will still top out at 400M/h and for abyssal space take a big chunk of investment that will not work if your connection is not rock solid.
---
The fact is that back in the day anyone playing smartly could PLEX their accounts without spending tens of hours grinding something. Now all the AFK activities and bots mean that some people can afford an outrageously overpriced commodity, where you see  the price rise to adjust for these sort of buyers.
---
I did mention that the most sensible way to earn ISK quickly is to just pay $ for PLEX and sell it (more so now than ever too!), but it is a shit argument to make. People have bills to pay and other things to buy, instead of spending it on some digital currency. 500 PLEX costs £17 here in UK. I could go see two movies in a cinema for that much money, buy four pints of beer in a pub, or go to a local cafe for a meal. I'm not willing to debate whether 2bil ISK in ships and equipment will equate to the same amount of enjoyment, as I'm strongly biased towards real-life tangible goods.
---
Most people would have just rounded to the nearest thousand M3. But you specified it. I want you to know that I appreciate that
---
good suggestion +1
---
The deep inhale, then, the loud BOI! I noticed that, for a game like eve that has very in depth character customization for you to rarely every see it as you mentally plot you're take over of null-sec.
---
Most of that 425 million went to investors. Ccp as a company would have gotten virtually none of that in terms of money to spend on developing. Its how corporate buyouts work. Frankly in the corporate world, being worth 425 mil is not much. For the size of clientele that ccp has they would have been worth alot more if they were smarter.
---
Furthermore they do publish bottom line data like most companies, so finding ccps profits is not hard, and while they are profitable they don't make that much tbh. 
---
nobody cares about falcon making funny faces
---
&gt;The recent balance announcement is a step in the right direction.
---
Yea, and as much as people are complaining it needs to go higher to filter out some of those multi accounts. Eve needs to return more towards regular single / double account game instead of what it is now.
---
So I'm very glad it keeps on climbing and I'm looking forward to AFK / multiboxer screeching.
---
Why were you trying to hold at 2000m? Keeping at range reduces your transversal which lets Kritsan hit you easier, and the game won't correct your position until you're already out of position.
---
Orbit at 500 (the closest you can get) and Kritsan will keep trying to turn to the direction directly away from you. Which means they can't go at max speed.
---
Is that windows 95?

Everything you listed is playing hard in my eyes. You don't get rich by doing what are basically menial labour tasks that everyone else is also doing.

I knew Kardia for many years, from Dust 514 and rhen in EVE, great dude, will miss him.

Holy shit, before I stopped playing I bought like 22 plex to consolidate my funds, that was like 5 years ago when plex was like 175mil
---
wait wait wait... that guy is gone?! 
---
You'd have to justify the assumption that this went up, tho. Why? Within the last two months the moving average  and the price went up considerably, highder demand would be a good explaination it seems but I'm unsure what could be causing it.

---
Within the last two month's, tho? Might me a winter high point, I guess.
---
The price is pretty much too high at this point. Basically everyone who runs it casually will be taking losses.
---
Autopilotings is much safer through lowsec than it is in highsec. I autopilot haul into lowsec all the time. Most people think a autopiloting wreathe is a trap.

I care!

Leave the Welshman alone. He is busy leading fleets for goons
---
It’s being nerfed to 5.
---
Not everybody can be an industry tycoon or a master daytrader / Perimeter tradehub owner. Obviously those can generate billions a day, but it is out of reach for pretty much everyone in Eve. Be reasonable.
---
You could also run an Eve betting site and earn trillions of ISK by frauding dummies.
---
Oh wait...

I made a hurricane that goes 8k heated. It does the exact same thing as the Ramjag. The problem is that if you move in a straight line away from it, and your only action is F1 it, it will catch you. 
---
In a 1v1 fight the Jag is toast. 
---
In a 3v3 fight, the side with the dedicated tackle is usually toast.
---
The only reason I can think of to complain about a dedicated tackle ship doing what it was meant to do is that the small gang wants to fight against a larger group and win.
---
When you nerf the Jag, you are nerfing the most powerful ship in Eve, #*FRIENDSHIP*.

I absolutely love taking the Rancer pipe between Hek and Jita. There are two things that get my heart pounding in eve: PVP and hauling 3 bil worth of shit through lowsec in a wreathe. Thank you for being there to make my heart pound :)

---
That I did...
---
I don't have any more up-to-date data unfortunately. But it's my guess that the prices will increase until large rorqual farms take an unviable amount of hours mining to sustain their PLEX subscriptions, and I don't see that coming for a long time, as they can skill extract to cover a large amount of the subscription costs as well.
---
Really? You going to fight on a star? Good luck with that!
---
You don't need to earn billions a day, and there's still other activities. But if you can't do anything out of the ordinary, then you've gotta live with the fact that you're not competitive enough  to PLEX your account in a reasonable time.
---
 PLEXing isn't a right, it's a bonus for those who can manage it. It's designed to reward both dedicated players and those who fund CCP. 
---
This isnt why we hate you.  We hate you because you attempt to speak for goons and have lost touch with being a sane person able to have a reasonable conversation.  However, please do continue with your neurotic ranting.

Generally I do not agree that logi should be removed or hellnerfed. It adds a layer of complexity to the game and opens up decisions that makes it more interesting. It can engage smart gameplay.
---
For a more detailed discussion you‘d need to specify where exactly you want logi to be nerfed and extend your explanation why this is good beyond a thirst for bloodbaths.
---
game bad?
---
have memes
---
Christ you're dense. It has nothing to do with the volume traded. It's how much new supply comes in.
---
If the volume stays the same but the is less Plex being listed for sale, the price will go up.
---
Simple solution to fixing the game = uninstall...
---
On a less cynical note. I love flying logi ships. I'd hate to see them become useless. In small gang fights, being one of the few logi on the field can make a huge difference in the outcome. I do believe Faxes are a little too strong though. I hope the coming nerf puts them in a better spot.
---
Ahh good O'l P3EN-E
---
Some of these people have been reported to make $100k-$200k per year on botting. That is considerably more then cheap apartment. 
---
First no I am not upset. Being able to plex multiple accounts and far tons of sp to sell or use I absolutely enjoy. However from a financial perspective in regards to CCP it's not sustainable. Getting people to pay for their accounts through the game currency will not fund their company. It's a problem for them and as a player wanting to continue to play for many more years I recognize it's bad for the game.
---
For real tho. It’d be great if there was a way to jump multiple systems at once(but it takes longer) so that you could sit down in your Battleship and play Hologram Monopoly with your Corp/Fleet mates
---
This was a nerf added to make it harder for capitalists to exploit ignorant buyers and buyers who weren't paying attention. You'll sometimes get false positives in regions without a very active market for the item in question.
---
Depends, some people rake in mad billions, but whenever I try I make a little but, then prices shift and I'm either left holding stacks of items I overpaid for, or just sell them at a loss.
---
Thank you for your response, there are many ways they can be nerfed effectively without removing them, one option would be to bloom out their signature radius to make them easier to apply damage on, because as of now guardians and the like are able to operate with near impunity.
---
With that being said, i do appreciate the extra level of complexity they add, but their current state has created an unhealthy ecosystem for the game, preventing meaningful losses and indirectly driving a lot of inflation.
---
Here take my upvote

Spent my 12 trill on plex before going inactive which I made from rorq mining since last year. Since CCP is doing fuckall about the botters I figure I spend the rest of my isk on plex when heading out. I know a bunch of other people who are hoarding plex as well.
---
I guess one way to fuck botters is hoarding plex right? I know it fucks with the rest of the peasants out here who survive off plex but you are just collateral damage to CCP in order to have them do something about the bots.

More plexed invidual accounts are good because it increases the size of the playerbase and Eve network.
---
More plexed alts are not.

The latter has eaten into the former as higher productivity players price out the unproductive. This has been going on for the past few years now, and I would argue actually started a bit before injectors, but has accelerated drastically.

The people who fly logi are a godsend, and i hate to ruin their gameplay but current mechanics with logi are pretty broken, perhaps a solution would be to increase general sig radius or create a bloom on the logi's  signature radius when they activate their reppers or cap transfer.
---
Fax are a different beast altogether and likely require a more heavy handed approach.

It's not overpriced. EVE is a free market economy, so any price on the market is, by definition, fair. Just because it's too expensive for you does not mean it's overpriced.
---
&gt; Not everybody can be an industry tycoon or a master daytrader 
---
And not everybody can plex their account every month. People talk about plexing like it's something everyone should be able to do by default with little to no effort. Why? You're not entitled to it any more than I or anyone else is.

How should you estimate price relative to average when nobody has sold enough units in recent time to estimate the average?

The game defaults to 1 or 0.01 isk I believe, I forget which.

I dont know, promise them some purple systems and theyd probably be pretty interested.

Hard work going up in smoke? I'm sorta confused by that statement tbh, do you by any chance play to be eve rich? I see pve and isk as a means to pvp and actually enjoy the game. You grind isk to buy ships so you can fight and they can eventually blow up. Obviously you're not trying to intentionally feed your ship but taking even or slightly unfavorable fights or bait will get you killed at some point usually, but those will usually be the best fights if you win.
---
oops forgot a number have 350k plex

---
If I had a lot more isk to blow, I would have bought him a monacle to complete the look, instead got stuck with an Odin eye.
---
You realize that if anyone could easily afford Plex the price would rise with demand right? It's not *supposed* to be easy to achieve. I'm not sure why you think it is now or ever was supposed to be.
---
&gt; Hard work going up in smoke? I'm sorta confused by that statement tbh, do you by any chance play to be eve rich?

I find i enjoy flying ships around and blowing people up and sometimes being blown up. If i don't have the fun to simply spin up another one then i have to sit and wait. And that part isn't fun. Meaning my fun per hour is directly and inexorably linked to how much isk per hour i can make because flying around in a pod isn't fun.

Pick up a blackbird, choose your favorite flavor (strawberry, lemon, blueberry or apple) and give those logi some sweet jam!
---
It's ~~delicious and nutritious~~ stimulating and a strong force multiplier.  I don't recall my FCs calling for ewar, but most I've flown under have been happy to get it.  Ewar reduces or stops logi (depending on fleet size), breaks cap chain, and overall sows confusion and chaos.  Logi pilots often say how much they enjoy being more than linemember #1234, but ewar is the same way.  Only offensive instead of defensive.
---
In conclusion, logi is a force multiplier, but ewar is a hard counter.

Nobody really quits EVE

Then unlimited SP is flowing into the game. Though having NPCs sell Skill Extractors is interesting thought but it would cut into CCP bottom line.

CCPs actual plan to fix logi on kill mails is to just remove logi.

i want to wish you both good luck, we're all counting on you

Great, but if you think with 1.2t you are a major player in the plex market ima have bad news for ya

yea an area where the vast majority of people are chinese (a race)
---
Well if it makes you feel better - as one of those 1200 goons, we had no idea what was going on either. I can only assume that at some point the FC's decided to pivot from "let's kill the keepstar" to "fuck it let's tidi subcap brawl".
---
I think the real-time of the fight was only like 5-6 minutes because I only used 6 command booster charges, which is insane for how intense that fight felt.
---
Oh imagine that...but seeing as how you’re the only one talking about race thanks for drawing the spotlight to yourself. We are talking about a region known for botting and exploit. K thnx bye

Seeing this great game as a newbie all over again

I would like, without even evict Goons, just enough to diminish them in number and pressure, and refresh the nullsec  with new non-aligned alliances / coalitions.

Plex prices being up 4 fold in 4 years aren’t out of hand? What’re you smoking man
---
"Reduce the base duration of the PANIC module to 4 minutes, up to 6 minutes with max skills"...
---
That moment when you realize you have become an immortalized eve meme
---
Isn’t a better way to attack botters just to gank their ships?
---
Also, I would think that botters would be the least sensitive to plex price changes since they can grind for 24 hours each day. Humans get out off by 30 hours of ratting a month.
---
While I appreciate your enthusiasm. I think you are only screwing over eve players by hoarding PLEX.
---
The irony lol
---
I have a really good buy order on scrap metal in 1DQ. I can vacuum it up for half as much as it’s worth reprocessed.
---
Considering current game mechanics if they have the will to I'm not sure it's possible for them to not. 
---
imagine thinking 1.2t of plex is significant in any way
---
Hey, drinking in game would be a great feature.
---
&gt; My experience is basically just carting cheap stuff around on my alt occasionally, and I don't think I'd be particularly competent to pick the exact stats for such a hypothetical hauler. I don't think that invalidates my observation that there's a really large cost/capability gap between t1 haulers and everything else
---
At a certain point, the price of 200m becomes very little, especially considering what veteran players will end up hauling for themselves will easily value over 2b. The base 250m +50m fitted DST really is the interim medium hauler you’re postulating about. An actually expensive DST would include a roughly 500m-750m fitting, plus an additional 1-2b worth of implants for going bling. An even more expensive option would constitute a Jump Freighter, which will cost close to 10b base, or several DSTs or several blockade runners multiboxed together.
---
read title thought 2bil, clicked saw 2bil. rofl'd for days 
---
One of my favorite moments wasnt really a big win or anything but it was during WWB when everyone was deployed to saranen. Dbrb was running a harassment sniper corm fleet while i had a beam confessor fleet. I had one of my corp mates switch from his confessor to a pontifex after he did his warp games for a bit. Next time he came to my fleet at 100 i had him hit his mjd and we got ontop of their fleet, pointed boat, killed some of his fleet members then him. After that he reshipped to ceptors and ran away citing sov defense was needed done instead.

*cough* rorqual mining *cough cough*

Whoop! I thought it was 6 max now! My mistake.

CCP getting license to sell crocs ingame when?

Honestly the amount of stuff preds killed in the first 5 hours of them setting up this is an acceptable lose 
---
You get to glimpse the 300m boots

Man, but he wants to say "efsi tidi, ccplz" to the end of times. That's it.

---
Read this, in its entirety, from the start. http://marketsforisk.blogspot.com/?m=1
---
It's all part of a grand plan. In the end all alliances but tikle will merge into either test or tikle, and the coalition will be renamed after those two alliances
---
You know where we live. ;)
---
That's the plan you feeble minded individual. Kill the eve player base until this game is bots online.
---
We’re recruiting.
---
&gt; That being said do the math: 1 rorq = ~ With shit skills 100-150mil/hr after product is sold. Multiply that times 7 accounts running simultaneous = 1bil 50mil /hr.
---
That does not create Isk.  In fact, it creates goods while keeping Isk constant which is the opposite.
---
&gt; CCP is going to find out that their income revenue is going to go in the toilet if they can't find a fix for this....fast.
---
???
---
CCP doesn't make money when people PLEX their accounts.  They make money when people buy PLEX.  In fact, when PLEX prices go up, people have more incentive to buy PLEX to sell for Isk and CCP probably does better.
---
There is currently more demand for PLEX compared to the supply provided by people paying CCP $$$ and creating the item.
---
They literally tried to shoot my ship. That is against me.
---
Isn't that sort of project discoverys job 
---
from what I've seen (and I have no idea if any of these prices are legit, I've never done any RMT to find out) a billion isk is about $5 if you sell it illegally. to make $100k doing it, you'd have to be generating 1.67 trillion isk per month. That's about 14% of the total amount paid in NPC bounties in Delve each month. So I guess maybe if goons took all the ISK they earn from ratting taxes in Delve, invested none of it in their alliance, and sold it all on the internet, they might be able to make about $120k.
---
But you said you bet hundreds of players are doing it. Let's be generous and say these players are only paying $50k in rent per year. That means, that to fund their rent through RMT, they'd each need to generate about 833 billion isk per month. February 2019 saw a gross gain of about 107 trillion isk. This means that even if every single new ISK was sold via RMT, there would be at most about 128 people making 50k per year off RMT. As plenty of people make isk and DON'T RMT it, there's no way "hundreds" of players are making lucrative amounts of money through RMT.
---
Remember kids, you can get tetanus from any deep puncture wound. Iron oxide in a cut will not suddenly make you obtain the tetanus. 
---
uhm, CCP is not affected by this. PLEX only comes out of buying it from them. There are no other sources of PLEX. After the item is inside of the game the problem is of the players, not of the company.
---
Your PI math is garbage
---
I live on the east coast. Might have to skip school
---
Imagine being in a 60,000 member coalition that won't fork out 100mil for some poor fucker's +4s
---
Can confirm. I bot with 307 accounts, make up about 30% of the Delve MER numbers and just bought my 3rd house.
---
You do realize that plex is not a limited resourse right? The ammount of it that you have does nothing to take away from what is out there. There is no such thing as not enough plex. The only your plex is good for is driving down the price for a couple of days maybe and then it will go back to where it is at and will continually rise. As wealth becomes easier to gain through ingame sources as it currently is it is what id setting the price. I remember back in the day doing 30day time codes for 300mil years before plex was a thing. 
---
Asking for a friend obviously:  
---
I've scanned a system &amp; got the results in a spreadsheet P4M7 = 0.32a, 0.60b, 0.08c: how do I determine the isk/month\* (or other unit of time), so that I know which one to anchor a Refinery on?
---
&gt; For free players, it is obviously bad - it means more ISK generation needed per month in order to exchange for a sub. For every increment in PLEX prices, some free players will decide it's not worth it and quit or go alpha.
---
Free players are not meant to PLEX.  Everyone can't PLEX their account, the supply isn't there.  Isk can be multiboxed, the real life $$$ that created the PLEX item cannot be.  
---
When everyone tries to PLEX, it drives up PLEX prices.  When PLEX was made granular anyone with 3mil could buy a "share" and they did.  You no longer had to save up the whole amount.  You could just buy a share whenever you had 3mil and it's a lot easier to spend too much when you are buying something a 500th at a time.  I highly suspect that people that have no business PLEXing (because it takes them 30 hours) are buying a share at a time every time they have a couple mil (because the price is going up! /s).
---
I don't station trade I contract trade fairly profitable if you have a bit of capital and its extremely low effort I just refresh contracts every 10 minutes or so.
---
The value of ISK is actually dropping, because it makes more economic sense to just buy plex and sell it than spend time in game farming ISK to buy plex.
---
I trained other things at first but I didn't know what I truly wanted until I could fly it a panther or any blops really. Blinged it out because that's kinda required without a huge fleet me and a friend deployed by our self (3-4 blops 2 fuel trucks and 2 supers). It was some of the funnest gameplay I've done.
---
The panther became my favorite ship it earned me money and it gave me good content. Hopefully after the patch we will deploy again it was fun living in red space without docking for a month and making money from the deployment. Plenty of fun stories from that deployment and funner then doing anything with the alliance I was in honestly.
---
Grats on your hel! It's a great looking ship.
---
Never heard of the casino wars. Please tell us more.
---
Are we supposed to be impressed? It's a big pond, and you're not even a fish
---
Did I just get flair baited
---
Volume's are hard to track through the in game market alone because of existing plex already in game. People like me exist, for example, who buy plex and sit on it for a good time to sell. Though they are much, much better at it. I held for 8 months before selling, just as an example.
---
So you're telling me bots don't exist, because the income is less than rent? Well I'll be a monkeys uncle. Maybe all the bots are just doing it to pay their monthly subscription. Gee that makes sense now. Thank you! 
---
Thanks! The first one I really went for (not counting the frigate) was the Phantasm loved the way it looked and its bonuses sounded nice. Unfortunately I had no clue what I was doing at the tine and lost a good bit of them lol
---
Now I have no issue running them and enjoy using them when I can. Id love to get into black ops BS, but currently enjoying recon ships a lot atm, even though I cant seem to find content after roaming for 2 hrs xD
---
Seeing as we saw not one but multiple back to back massive super cap battles on a scale not seen since B-R during that time period.. I'm not sure that's the best period to use.
---
I also looked at the massive carriers and Titans, but the first ship the grabbed me for some reason was an anshar. I ended up hitting that mile stone a couple of months ago. Then I decided I wanted to be able to fly every ship in caldari so I trained so I could fly every ship. My last two trains where the carrier and titan. I just finished training t2 fighters and am on my way to a nyx.
---
Then not so long in the future hopefully a titan, but we shall see. Seeing cool and interesting ships gives me a goal and a drive. It probably does the same for you, that's what at least drives my gameplay.
---
You sont need spies to see what reqs doing. Just look at rats killed and adm.  
---
If you want knowledge go to the brain not the ass.
---
Correction, the next NOT big thing.
---
This is basically the same thing in terms of in game plex value, honestly.
---
Didnt one of tikles corps go to req?
---
SHUT
---
Yea thats exactly it for me, I see it and want it. Then I setup a build for it to train what I need and go for the mastery certs as well. Good luck on the titan! Im currently saving for mine as well :)
---
10% TIDI is cancer.

Yup

Skill injectors were a mistake.

There seems to be a concerted effort on the part on the winning side to disregard and suppress knowledge of the fact that their victory against CFC/The Imperium in 2016 was made possible by massive bribes by dirty casinos. But don't take my word for it, even the famously anti-Imperium news site EveNews24 admitted it:
---
&gt; “...all this planning and plotting required enough of a monetary incentive to push the Imperium’s enemies past the idea that fighting the Imperium would be suicide....”
---
&gt;“We’re not just doing this for money. We’re doing this for a shitload of money!”  
---
—http://evenews24.com/2017/03/14/eve-history-remembering-world-war-bee/
---
These casinos were later banned for RMT. CCP announced:  
---
&gt;“The third party service IWANTISK has been shut down in game, and all ISK and assets have been confiscated after extensive and exhaustive investigation has brought forward compelling evidence of large-scale Real Money Trading. Permanent account suspensions have been issued against those involved.”

---
The Vindicator, it's just so cool. The mega hull is so nice overall. But I'm not going to fly it without max skills.  
---
As for the ship I really love, it's the Thrasher. It all started when I was looking at Eve videos, and found 2 videos by Wheniaminspace where he just fucked shit up with a Thrasher, that seemed pretty gnarly so I joined his space guild, and got access to the unlimited free elite Thrasher stash, and got my first solo kill just minutes later.

Walking in anything anywhere will kill EVE online, we barely survived the first "iteration". If you want to walk around in stations or ships play another game.

The thing I like about this post is that it represents only a fraction of WH space content. I don't mean that in a bad way; you can get into apex brawling in WH space with so much ease compared to anywhere else. But there's also a lot more room for small gang content, solo content, et al.

I started playing in 07 and it was NEVER normal for a single person to have a capital main and another capital alt (aux today).  Game is in serious economic trouble and it doesn't make me feel better that CCP fired all their economists.

Color me surprised with basic economics.

Blops was very time consuming hunting specially in the current meta it was like a year or so ago wen we did it. Killed 50-60bil and made 20bil each was fairly fun. 
---
Roaming sucks in this meta though I feel you. I hope this patch encourages more subcap ratting thats not vnis/gilas so I can get more blops targets cause we delayed our new deployment until it hits.
---
bot man bad
---
You always have really insightful and helpful things to suggest for sub cap ship balance changes. Always appreciate your posts. Keep up the great work.
---
T3c will be much slower than a Stiletto. Good skills, cheap implants, 2 T2 scanning mods, sisters launcher/probes and you'll rip through the systems and sites. 
---
Wait, the way you phrase that makes it sound like it used to be a thing. 
---
Yeah, I got that and registered weeks ago, but have only received 2 emails about it since then, and nothing from which I can discern any instructions for what we are supposed to do on weds.

Chimera and Charon. I've flown them and I love how they look.

I also wanna sit in a Leviathan, but so far, that's just on SiSi!

The time is shit if they get 4000 players I'm very surprised

It's about missiles because the CNI uses missiles and we're talking about the CNI.
---
Don't get all on your high horse about alts being the reason why you have downvotes. Have you considered that the reason you're not voted up is because your post is dumb?
---
I could easily see multiple botting accounts generating some supplemental income. Let's say 5 accounts. I have no idea what they make, but there's a program that boasts you can make billions while at work. So let's say 2 billion a day over 5 accounts. That's 10 billion a day or 300 billion a month. 1 billion isk goes for $5 or so. So you're looking at roughly $1500 a month. 
---
Yea... I could love that. 
---
Using 5 t1 fit Thrashers to kill 10 TEST excavators 
---
I mean, losing a fully fitted Tengu is at the very least a reason for annoyance, even if you can pay for another.
---
Should have saved time and not bothered shooting a keepstar twice 
---
You were able to walk around a small room and sit on a couch looking at a data screen, IIRC they announced they trying to make it into something bigger a long time ago, but then they ended up scrapping it because it took too much work for how many players were using it.
---
Add cargo containers and biomass to your overview settings
---
Who woulda thought our salt extraction would be so profitable 
---
I was unaware they got kicked out of Period Basis. Where did you get that information?
---
CCP does make money from people PLEXing their accounts, just indirectly. All PLEX is bought with $ and is consumed when you PLEX an account. Every PLEX used to pay subscriptions was bought by someone who is essentially just paying that persons subscription for them in exchange for ISK.

Is he unable to see the level of dumb in his post

Super numbers don't compare to the plex numbers on dozens of rorqual pilots and skill farms.
---
He's just grumpy because [we call him on his shit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USCqxtA7ths).

Should do it like swtor, you can buy different areas and unlock them with plex and give out keys etc, only so many people can have access... This way more player CREATIVE content can be made.

That could be because you are getting slingshotted. The tormentor is usually better as a scram kiter then kiting with a disruptor though. It'ts hare to give you an accurate answer without seeing anything, but it seems like you are trying to do something with he ship that it is to slow for.

---
Completely get rid of botting in null by getting everyone to band together and create a network of alphas to just exist in every null system at once, boys will stay docked 24/7
---
You just can't count it twice, so you have to pick one.  You either track volume of plex moving through the market, or you count plex on consumption.  As long as you don't mix the two, either is valid.
---
I saw a machariel on the undock of a station way back in 2007 and decided that was the ship i wanted. Eventually i got one and upgraded to full officer bs and kinda lost any goal. When faction supers came out I looked at the vendetta and decided I needed it now so I got one and had a lot of fun gating it behind enemy lines and killing shit with it.
---
RMT is happening on different levels. 
---
On the bottom level there are Chinese/Rus botters for whom living costs are low enough to warrant full time RMTing. There is a guy, Silverminer, who ran 50 man fleets (45 barges, a charon, an aeon, a Rorqual) in 4 systems. You could actually see his presence on Delve ingame map. Lately [we have targeted him a lot](https://zkillboard.com/related/30004733/201811280500/). We don't see him anymore for some reason. How do I know he is an RMT'er? I don't. But I watched him do the same thing for an entire year. Nobody, and I mean nobody would suffer through running that setup for 14h/day for a year without RMT interests. He has anything he could want. Why would he be farming for more?
---
[This guy](https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98517701/) was allowed to run VNI bots in Delve for an entire year and paid his taxes. Last months he upgraded into Nyxes. Only after he fed the 3rd super to mar5hy's cloaky camping, /u/Wibla [decided](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/avofad/tnt_kicks_botting_corporation_thering_out_of/ehgo7km/) that he has "repeated broken promises a la "we're totally going to join fleets, promise!" and some seriously suspect cycling of seemingly randomly named characters in and out of corp that were typically not on auth, generating pretty suspicious-looking lossmails in the process." That guy spooled up perhaps 15 VNIs into Nyxes before he was kicked. Imagine what he was doing with all that money, and how much tax he made /u/Wibla before he kicked him to stay ahead of the narrative.
---
At the top level, some people do it for supplementary income. Like [this guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/at8mmc/goonswarm_financial_overlord_gets_a_permaban_for/).
---
And we don't really know what's happening at the very top. There is a sweet 15% tax on bounties and 3% on the market. The bounty tax alone amounts to 2t+ ISK per month, and they get another 1.5t/month from 1dq market tax. The interesting thing is, the entire alliance is optimized for attraction of krabs and co3llection of taxes. They get all these assets but do nothing with them to jeopardize the status quo and the farm. No major wars, no sov invations, no breakup of the alliance or breakup of NIPs with TEST to ensure some wars happening. Even their JB network was optimized for taxation rather than PvP content. They should have 70t to 100t accumulated in those alliance coffers past 3 years. Where the fuck does all this money go? Who knows. It all stinks like shit though.
---
removal
---
But it's NOT huge reward. It's only HUGE reward because, some bright sparks in Goonswarm, figured out that mining with 10 rorquals at once, gets them 10 times richer than 1 rorqual. Truth be told, anything that is high risk for any other alliance or individual, will get to go get tested by our scientists in labcoats until we perfect that magic isk faucet out of a process. Goon autists min/max everything and that's just what we do. We are THAT rich because we're socialists who are better at Capitalism than most of those alliances that claim to be Capitalistic in nature. We share the wealth around our community. The Hive works together to achieve more. We have boffins working around the clock to perfect all aspects of the game so that every Goon can own at least 2 titans each. The goal is set... other entities cannot compete because they're yet to figure out the collective mindset we have that works immensely successfully.

I prefer Citadel trading, which is when I scoop unattended citadels, then sell them. https://i.imgur.com/5rQZ9Gq.png
---
Alternatively permanently camp Hothomouh...
---
Or one capital.
---
 I turned 1 bil into 16 in my first month AMA
---
+1 on using margin trading. It lets you put up a lot more buy orders for good margin items that are less likely to be fulfilled, making up for the limited fulfillment by just having a ton of buy orders up. 
---
How??? You can just scoop unpowered cits?
---
Like hooow? How do you pick your items? I make isk if I'm camping the shit of a few items with several buy and sell orders, but that's tedious as fuck.
---
we don't. 
---
and make sure nobody else does.
---
No, but you can scoop unanchored citadels. Mostly when someone is moving and unanchors them, then forgets to scoop.
---
yes that exactly my thinking.  after a certain point I can see where it would become unhelpful but starting out it was definitely a god send :)
---
Which would be never? Unfortunately people will always find a way to automate activities, pve in eve is not that complicated and that is one of the reasons there are so many bots
---
Well Plex is now split into smaller chunks, you need 500 of them to sub for a month. At the moment that equals ~2b Isk/mo.
---
that makes a lot of sense, i was browsing the sub and saw people talking about buying hundreds of PLEX and i thought i’d lost my mind
---
Sounds a lot like PL
---
because end game eve is about hell dunking and blue balling
---
Goons also have that kind of liquid. Maybe they could pay their enemies to fight?
---
thats awesome dude.  i can definitely see where trading would scale to investment.  i locked myself out of some items due to lower initial investment but i was pretty happy with how things worked out overall.
---
Rip anyone not eutz you mean

I’ll vote for this.

&gt;I remember back in the day doing 30day time codes for 300mil years before plex was a thing.

---
Great work mate
---
&gt;&gt;Don't drop sell amounts or raise buy amounts by stupid levels. You will see people do this. Item A is selling for 25m and buying at say, 15m.
---
This is good general advice, but once you have more money there are more advanced tactics to abuse this.  
---
Situation 1: Buy order keeps getting undercut by bot or active market trader.  Keep raising the limits on the buy orders until you find their limit.  Then bow dip out of that items market.  You can successfully raise buy order prices 20-50% on some items, and then leave the market yourself.  This means less capital for your competitors.
---
Situation 2: Undercut someone like mad while selling if they keep undercutting you.  Keep lowering your sell listing (preferably 1 stack)  They will keep undercutting you with their high quantity stacks.  You can drive the prices down 50-75% sometimes, then purchase their entire stock, and relist.  Beware undercutters with huge stock though, they could be undercutting you on a 100 order, but have 10,000 backstock to undercut you again if you buy them out at the "cheap" price.
---
For sale?
---
Will never happen. It's not a software restriction. It's a security restriction they put in for a reason.
---
It’s great! I don’t need to leave my home system ever, if I wanted. Undock and boom content every time
---
Yeah seen that too. Another part of the game that is broken.
---
i definitely agree that there are tactics and market manipulation points that i could have touched on but honestly i thought the wall was high enough and i didnt want to overload any possible beginners.  if you watch the market fairly close you will begin to notice trends or see tactics being used.  i look it as "on the job training".  i dont mind holding someones hand on things but i dont want to carry them kinda thing i guess. ;)
---
Everybody wants something for free. You're all peasants and that's what's really killing Eve.
---
I see no button for “Titan Skins that you never see because of tidi and potato mode”
---
Nah. Just use it when you go afk and you don't have to go through the tedious clicking of jump 10000 times. It is great.
---
On a more serious note autopilot is not 100% worthless. Just don't make yourself a target by flying something worth tears when you use it. Also probably worth saying: use it only in high-sec. :)
---
All I want is apple to stop telling me that eve won’t work on the next update .... 
---
Same
---
Do tell
---
many years...dude your 15 years old
---
Why does everyone think the 64-bit client is some sort of silver bullet that will fix everything.
---
The new client does nothing on its own. It may open up avenues of performance improvements in the future.
---
That's it.
---
But as this requires you to be logged in on an alpha that locks you out of the game due to the eula
---
I love how FRT dudes post a bridge Marshal kill while having several hundred billion destroyed in the last 3 days. Meanwhile Legacy destroy an entire eagle fleet and no BR is posted anywhere. Seems like FRT killing anything is big news and FRT getting shit on is just another day going by.
---
Come back to me when you fit a hyper rag and cant cloak for 5mins my dude its the real level shit. but if you do use your super in hostile space +1
---
"I was not afk when you caught me, I was just having a good time with my fedos.."
---
I think he wants to have content and not be someone else content. 
---
I don't think it's a silver bullet.  I don't expect it to fix all the issues people have overnight.  I do hope that increased tech capabilities will enable QoL features like this in future patches down the road!
---
New in store “fedo” pets! Only 600 plex
---
Talk to Good Sax in Stain. 
---
I don't understand the technical side of it, but I understand 64-bit means more cores, more processing power, maybe they could correlate that into more security features without the current method.  It's not impossible there are games with character swapping without reloading the client and they're not getting hacked either.
---
We all have our own QoL needs.  Stay strong o7
---
PLEX can only go up from here! HODL brothers HODL!
---
Why, so you can have 2 characters doing no digging instead of 1?
---
 I was spread across a large amount of item types with good margins it was a nightmare to update but it paid off.I had deadspace mods faction mods popular t2 mods tags implants building materials even salvage in my sights.
---
Das racist!
---
you understands it wrong
---
64bit does not mean more core or power, it only means that application can address more ram than 4GB. And as we saw, ccp did already horrible job when clients on test were able to take over 11GB... thats hilarious and WRONG
---
nothing else will change with this "64bit"
---
Large newbro alliances have things like free BPC programs, logistics (hauling) services, and buybacks that can buy your finished products in bulk for something like 90-95% Jita buy value, as well as sell things like bulk salvage, minerals, and datacores locally.  Brave has all of those programs, is in Sansha space for good exploration, and has both an active PvP hub and a safe krabbing region under a powerful supercap umbrella.
---
Nope. 64 bit means the client can use more than 4 gigs of memory. Which means less client crashes during tidi blobs because the client dies whenever it exceeds its memory limit. 
---
Thanks for the writeup, ive always failscaded in trading lul
---
Say hypothetically I want to farm ship BPCs running missions in null, and I want to use some of those BPCs to build ships locally for my own use.  Would the best way to aquire minerals to buy compressed ore in a nearby hub and have it imported in a JF?  Is there a tool where I can enter my needed minerals and have it tell me the most efficient ore to import?  Also hypothetically speaking, anyone know of any corps based in Venal that participates in said activities while PvPing actively?
---
New upwell structures. Faction fortizars replaced old nullsec stations
---
Wetherspoons mate....
---
 If you look closely at the graph of an item it has spikes and dives also you can base your item choices on what people use alot on their ships like for example abyss runners use alot of faction drones faction LSE and large fac batteries and they lose alot of them.Others in hs use alot of orcas maybe look at faction mining drones like augmented ones.Theres a big war or deployment?what do they use well alot of bombers are used by everyone maybe ferox related modules maybe a t2 hull like munnin .Is some big wh group evicted maybe t3 subs will go up a bit etc etc
---
There you go no more Logi, [https://zkillboard.com/kill/75744515/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75744515/) (Wolf Rayet Wormhole). ECM is a hard counter to logi. 
---
You guys don’t go full body when viewing people? 
---
Still doesn't have anything to do with 64bits. Do you actually think it is impossible to do that with a 32 bit client?
---
Skill injectors will stay until skill injectors adversely affect profits. 
---
Odin's call are good people, but I think it's about time they moved out of the pi hole and got themselves a c5. With the numbers they can pull they could easy squash caps single handed. I just hope they don't catch a case of the shithousery whereby they live in a c4 to avoid eviction or good cap fights. 
---
Sure. 
---
Unless you want to reassign drones every 5 mins when your hauler warps in and out.
---
I'd gladly sacrifice 1 miner not to have to re-anchor or reassign drones every 5 mins.
---
A simple, direct conversion to 64 bits without any other performance work will increase RAM usage because some of the data in the program will take up twice the storage space (memory addresses now use 64 bits instead of 32). Not by a lot, though, and in exchange the program can now load more than 4GB of data. At the same time, it will increase CPU performance as the x86-64 architecture has more internal registers than x32, so the processor can do more work without loading from RAM.
---
GPU is not affected at all.
---
Yep, but it lets you acquire isk at huge rates.         
---
You can sell the ore and get isk from other plaers - or build and destroy insured battleships for direct ISK injection. 
---
Will to do it.     
---
There is pretty easy fix for injectors and exractors.         
---
1. You can inject as much SP as you trained normally.            
---
2. You can extract 50% of normally trained SP.              
---
&gt; RAM usage per client
---
I've got bad news for you.
---
i dont mind giving you some personal advice if you wanna try it out again.  my main is Moebeus .... hit me up with a mail. ;)
---
It was not so hard actually.       
---
Currently i am getting to point when multilple chars on each of my account can fly dread + fax +(optimally super and/or titan).         
---
No injectors.  
---
WALLTREIPERS, now in INIT.
---
I also love my Hel, but stuff that will come will quite probably kill shield supers again (fax changes and implementation of shield slaves - and shield nerfs accompanying them)       
---
I always wanted to have Revenant. Can afford one tbh - but the point is that person like me cannot get one as all BPC are stolen from Sansha Nation. 
---
I'll keep note of that, thanks! :)
---
The word is that 64bit client will be most helpful for tidifest situations where clients need more ram (as it can access more ram), and will keep the client from crashing. But those situations are irrelevant to me.
---
The question is whether the client will use more ram in normal situations I typically play.
---
Where were they "spouting" this?
---
GOONS are the strongest in eve FYI, not only that but they kicked north teeth in, GOTG bribed them to leave them alone and NC/PL/C02/HORDE and the group lost huge amount of titans ( up to 50 if im not wrong ) in X47L battle over NC Keepstar ( which got blown up aswell )
---
My PC can barely handle the 7 clients I have to run (without using optimization software like Isboxer). My typical bottleneck is CPU, followed by ram. We'll see how it plays out. CPU is good news. Adding more ram is not that hard.
---
while mining you can bfg havens
---
Dropped dreads with FCON when house alarm went off, in the end it was okay but grandma burnt the rice.
---
&gt; Say hypothetically I want to farm ship BPCs running missions in null, and I want to use some of those BPCs to build ships locally for my own use. Would the best way to aquire minerals to buy compressed ore in a nearby hub and have it imported in a JF?
---
if you have max build skills, yeah, the best way would probably be black frog or pushx, although building them closer to empire (or even in a public structure in high sec) would be easier and cheaper. farming npc pirate burner missions is pretty common in venal, curse, and fountain actually, there should be a wealth of information available on it
---
&gt;Is there a tool where I can enter my needed minerals and have it tell me the most efficient ore to import?
---
eve isk per hour
---
&gt; Also hypothetically speaking, anyone know of any corps based in Venal that participates in said activities while PvPing actively?
---
if you don't speak russian, there aren't a whole lot, now that black legion is rip. banderlogs and siberian squads are the only two groups i know of currently active in venal doing that sort of thing
---
Wise words...
---
Damn, i started doing the same thing a bit earlier, exact same starting capital as well and now sitting at about 1.5 bil including asset value. 
---
I found trading meta items are the best way to go while dabbling sometimes in the salvage and t2 market when meta items crash. The most used items are missiles, points, damage amplifiers, and shield extenders. Meta items have high buy/sell rates usually with a very nice margin, but idiots as stated by OP crash the market every now and then. Other days you can earn 100+ mil in an hour due to how crazy demand skyrockets for everything.
---
T2 items are only really worth trading in highly used items. Sure it may be quite a bit slower to acquire and have smaller margins but that sacrifice is sometimes worth it for stability.
---
Salvage is sometimes unstable, but has very high buy/sell rate. However you would have to compete with literal autists/bots who have nothing better than to 0.01 isk you.
---
Alpha btw, omega account would be better. Also grinding corp standing is a must for jita trading, it cuts out about 10% of your buy price without skills
---
I remember the day when a 30day plex was 230mil... :(
---
&gt; Incursions [...] need a big up-front investment
---
not if you fly logi
---
a fully blinged incursion fit scimi can be had for about 5-600m total and most groups will take you with a less shiny fit if they're hard up for logi (which they always are)
---
lol not every subreddit is highly active
---
I think its a broader question for CCP what they want to accomplish with Navy/fleet ships all together. 
---
Buffed T1? Different roles/purposes? PVP/PVE? Something that sits in the middle between T1 and T2? What about skill requirements? What about balance between T1 - navy/fleet - T2 in all aspects (usage, dps, tank, costs, skill requirements etc)? etc.
---
Atm it kinda feels they are all over the place...
---
19, and I started playing Dust when I was 12, probably met Kardia when I was 14 or 15
---
blueprints can be locked in a corp hangar, usable by corp members but not removable
---
there's really no measure of trust involved, the mechanics prevent you from getting stolen from if you just have a blueprint library for people to use
---
i started to touch on alpha trading but i decided to leave it alone.  i'm glad to hear that you are able to work around the issues that alpha status presents and make a good margin.  standings are awesome for helping lower some of the overhead but with this project i wanted to stay docked as much as possible to maintain the station trading feel...plus im lazy sometimes so there is that :)
---
&gt;goons are the strongest in eve
---
even after they got evicted from delve i knew that!
---
no but srsly i love this song glad to hear goons are doing well
---
I spent 185b in January, I've made most that back in the last 2 months. AMA
---
Last I heard CCP coded themselves in a corner that's why it hasn't happened.
---
I'd likely support a wardeccer candidate but I'm not gonna read wall of texts. Make memes or infographics.
---
I can understand that. Next week I will do better. 
---
I forgot to mention that without blanket wars and camping trade hubs / pipes that we wouldn’t have the glorious TEXAS LAW meme. That’s gotta count for something. 
---
There's this thing called faction warfare in "low security" space. I legit would have a stockpile of 30 t1 kiting tristans (which would run me like 8 mill each), log in for an hour or so (either alone or with friends) and try to get some fights then dip when I got bored or had to go. 
---
Or you could do exploration, setup near dangerous space and just do shit on your own schedule. 
---
5-6 hours is more than enough for either. 
---
:( 
---
How do I play?
---
Unfortunately thanks to the actions of the Gallentean animal rights group FEDA, fedos are now considered people by law. As such you will need to pay a full subscription fee per month per fedo or CONCORD will be forced to 'intervene' on your fedo's behalf.
---
So even irregardless of isk though, wasnt it just a spectacular failscade of spodbraindrain? I think like all the goons had a giant unassailable armada, including CO2(and when they left suddenly goons lost their manhood or something??), and somehow got absolutely wiped into saranen where they just docked for a while when all the alliances kind of flailed like a wet noodle. 
---
Like i think adversity and other rando lowsec groups first matched against goons, won a fight or two, then it litteraly fell apart like a flaccid deflating baloon. Was it even a real war? I think it was pl and nc that just killed tons of structures in deklein, along with darkness, and goons just scurried off
---
So i mean regardless of the isk coming in did it actually effect this "war"?
---
And they'll be in that same exact corner with the 64bit client.
---
Play through the entire  tutorial and career agents then come back and ask specific questions. 
---
As much as you want.
---
Whoever is telling you that you need to constantly be playing EvE to get any enjoyment out of it is an idiot.
---
There are a lot of activities in this game, and they all have their own time commitment required or recommended to succeed. You just need to be realistic in your endeavors and keep in mind how much you can realistically play.
---
Well, as someone who is financing his expensive ship losses with real money, this is always nice to see
---
Let's be fair, the wardeck change wasn't about creating more conflict, it was about allowing new corps to be made without being wardecked to death. The more conflict part is going to come later with the end the war with the destruction of the War HQ to end the war.
---
Regarding your arguments in regards to how war immunity shouldn't comes free, about I disagree. It's more important for the health of the game to have corp being able to build themselves than to allow HS wardecker to have easy targets to pick. You want Eve to be a food chain eco-system, yet you live in HS. You only want it to be a food chain because you would be on top in that case. Go and try to make your place in NS if you like food chain so much.
---
Not that I think HS is in a good state, but let's face it, HS "wars" will always be about picking up target you can win against. HS IMO would be a lot smaller, no more moon and lot less profitable L4 missions.
---
I have some stupid question just to satisfy my newcomer's curiosity, if you all don't mind: are there ships with cargo hold big enough to fit unpacked ships? And if this is the thing, would it be (theoretically) possible, to fit different ships for say combat/salvaging/relic scans into one carrier and swap them on site? And what would even happen to ships undocked directly from carrier? Can you even move capsule from one ship to other?
---
It's a fence. See the spaces?
---
Assuming they are still doing it because I haven’t been around much for a while, Goons have an alt corp up there running burners.  Their setup is amazing with citadels in every system a burner can spawn where you stock a Garmur and ammo. Plus ships for the other burners if you’re doing more than just Team Burners. 
---
Explains why content is also drying up, people less willing to grind to make their plex might as well stay docked 
---
Corporations kick inactive dudes. If you're active one a week, that's good enough for most corps. 
---
Found one of these in some rat ass system in detorid thats never used by litteraly anyone.
---
9 data sites
---
9!!!!!
---
Since I started yesterday, This is more helpful than you think.
---
Cheers.
---
Rorq mining was a mistake. God intended hulks.
---
Youll need an almost unfeasable number of griffins and even then they can be wiped by many many many different game mechanics, even one dude can wipe that out.
---
Buying another rorq to mine in perfect safety isnt much of a hit.
---
In a meta where you plex 20 SP-Farms to plex your 10 Rorquals that plex your remaining 2 Fleet-Meat-Chars nobody should be surprised ... Not like people were foreseeing this since at least 1.5 years 
---
i downvote all posts from highsec wardeccers

Lost some pods recently huh?

---
Margin trading is always helpful imo.  Leaves isk in the wallet for opportunity buys without having to cancel orders.  
---
It can also help you roll over your isk faster by enabling you to create larger buy orders, which is important for when people dump on buy orders.  Otherwise without margin trading you'd have to create smaller orders so that if johnny ratter decides to dump all his loot you'll get more of it because you had bigger buy orders up.

---
I completely agree.  I've never understood the hate for margin trading skill.  It was by far the most useful skill I trained during this.  Thanks for the back up on that thought process :)
---
More to counter everyone in null secs claw fleets. We were far from the only one using it. 
---
Many corps are way more lax than that.
---
As much as one can without the known trolll RL greifing you.
---
Started playing around the same time - mine are the T3s, the first big patch I can remember. Even though I blazed through so many prots and legions in WWB they hardly lost any appeal - have one of each, all with ridiculously bling fits, my favourite fits and configs from my years in the game, getting blinger as I get richer, now with skins...just hanger queens. One day, when they are all totally purple, I will undock each one for Valhalla and then win Eve.
---
Praise Bob.
---
This guy is right. My attention span did not last me longet than the bold text. :(
---
EVE doesn't have "daily quests" you are expected to do each day, or "raid nights". It's perfectly fine to play EVE 5-6h a week.
---
One starting point would be one of the big new player friendly corps. Pandemic Horde, Karma Fleet, Brave Newbies etc. They don't have mandatory fleets or anything (at least PH doesn't) but will still offer content. You will get kicked for inactivity eventually (like not logging in one or two months for PH) but can simply reapply if you come back.
---
All of those corps offer content for new players and help you with your first steps in EVE.
---
There are other possibilities of course. Like faction warfare as someone pointed out. But I still think joining on of the big corporations is the easiest first step. You will get free welcoming package with ships/skill books etc once you join and generally can ask for a free ship when fleets are going out. There is content more or less around the clock.
---
And really, it doesn't cost you anything to try it out. 
---
bots are farming 7\*24.
---
The nosprey and the navy caracal need 2 distinct roles. Maybe the navy caracal should lean into its second bonus, remove the light missile bonus and add an explosion velocity bonus too the radius bonus.
---
What was going on in Camal?
---
I cannot wait for the shitstorm after the next big battle after the release of the 64 bit client because reeeeeee didnt fix balance, didnt fix random crash, didnt fix tidi, didnt fix desync, didnt fix my isp,  reeeeeee
---
Yes
---
All combat capital ships have Ship Maintenance Bays of varying size, so yes, you could certainly do that. I've heard of people living solo in wormholes out of a cloaked Rorqual, and whatever ships you need in the SMB. 
---
You can eject a ship from the SMB, and then jump your capsule into that ship. It would probably not be a good idea to do it with only one character though, since when you leave the ship in space, anyone else can jump in and steal it. Probably a better idea to leave your alt in the carrier, so you can cloak/safelog when you don't need it.
---
Get a load of PIRAT trying to join the discussion about their whole playstyle being nerfed into the ground.  
---
I've been waiting since two thousand and fucking four to see perma-wardeccers be nerfed and it might finally happen.   
---
They'll be forced to re-learn pvp with no neutral logi, no risk free camping in blingy ships and actual opponents who fight back; eventually they'll probably be greatful for having been forced away from the trade hubs and into the actual game world.
---
The Golem, it's just an amazing Caldari death machine.
---
oh yeh well i spent 186b in January and made most of that back in the last 1.9 months
---
Two med ancil + ADC + sigtank is a bit too much. Don't misunderstand me, i like the jag but i know it's completely overpowered, being able to tank several anti-supports cruisers and GTFO without sweating a single drop isn't my definition of an "healthy little ship".   
---
\-&gt; nerf PG or CPU so that the jag can only fit one single med ancil, you'll have a fine little ship that can do great things but offers some sort of counterplay to your opponents. Don't touch the speed though, it's fine imo. 
---
need to undock first bro
---
Thats not true at all, this is completely the opposite of eve's problem
---
can never go wrong making Sabre hulls, and when WWB was going on I made lots of money making Claw hulls.
---
So many reactions here of people whom seem to feel entitled to lower PLEX prices... I mean shit, you buying PLEX isnt making CCP money, ME buying PLEX to make boatloads of easy ISK with is making them money.  
---
The higher that price goes, the more inclined I am to buy PLEX to sell, if its too low I wont even bother with it.  
---
As for those who did "ze mathz" and say 67M is hard to earn... Even lazily running incursions a day a week will get you there with no problem whatsoever, and thats going the lazy, relatively low SP route with WTM incursions.  
---
TLDR: I dont consider these PLEX prices an issue, and if anything its probably going to increase profits for CCP, plenty of rorq alts to PLEX to keep up with the supply, even if poors cant afford it anymore.  
---
If its truly too expensive: Buy a normal subscription.  
---
If the subscription is too expensive: Get your life in order man, if less than $20 is a problem for you, you have bigger concerns than virtual spaceships.
---
That's ace. 
---
It's going to be a problem when the number of active accounts on the server drop to half of what it is today
---
I’ve always wondered why I was getting decloaked randomly in the middle of warp. 
---
&gt; Let's be fair, the wardeck change wasn't about creating more conflict, it was about allowing new corps to be made without being wardecked to death. The more conflict part is going to come later with the end the war with the destruction of the War HQ to end the war.
---
The first knee-jerk reaction change was intended shield new players and those uninterested from wars. What I’m talking about is CCPs proposed changes for wars to come in the future, namely the structure based conflict.
---
&gt; Regarding your arguments in regards to how war immunity shouldn't comes free, about I disagree. It's more important for the health of the game to have corp being able to build themselves than to allow HS wardecker to have easy targets to pick.
---
I feel that the war immune corps are a place for new players and groups to build up their skills and knowledge before embarking on the level: owning and operating a structure.
---
Everyone is a target to someone, and why should industrial-based corps in Highsec be exempt from this? Let’s be honest here, there’s plenty of groups that don’t reside in Highsec that are planting their flag in Highsec as well. Lots of gangs roaming through, industry alt corps, and such. Let’s say I owned and operated a network of Azbels in a 0.5 and Pirat came to destroy them... I would use the resources I have to network and find partners that would fight on my behalf or assist me in pushing them off. 
---
Why do we feel like everyone has to go through this MMO experience alone? You see your Astrahus sitting right here? Well a few thousand kilometers away is another Astrahus that belongs to another player - perhaps he is interested in interacting with you.
---
&gt; You want Eve to be a food chain eco-system, yet you live in HS. You only want it to be a food chain because you would be on top in that case. Go and try to make your place in NS if you like food chain so much.
---
Highsec definitely has a proper place in this food chain. You offer me as an example of wanting this because we’d be at the top of this chain, but that’s false. We currently already have groups and individuals that are good at catching and killing us - like I said everyone is a target to someone. I challenge you to take some time flying around highsec, and you’ll see an area where Nullsec groups are coming to hangout because they are tired of a stagnant Nullsec, areas where Nullsec groups are setting up markets, and so much more... all these are reasons for larger and stronger groups to be in and among highsec and if you’re at war with Pirat, is a reason to fight and interact. All I’m suggesting is that we shift from N+1 gameplay and have the end objective be destroying ships.
---
&gt; Not that I think HS is in a good state, but let's face it, HS "wars" will always be about picking up target you can win against. 
---
That sounds a lot like what Nullsec groups do when they deploy to an area to farm the residents, strange. Hm, it also sounds like what Lowsec groups do. Surely our honorable Wormhole friendos are above this behavior of picking easy fights... hm, sounds a lot like some wormhole evictions.
---
Let’s be honest, everyone loves to determine when they fight, how they fight, and who they fight. Those same people also like to think they don’t and are always honorable, straight-shooting pilots that are just in search of the “Gud Fite”. 
---
Yea the Vindy grew on me as well, plus its an amazing ship. Also yea the thrasher is great!
---
I think you’ll be sad if you’re anticipating this to be a nerf to our whole playstyle. You’ve waited this long, but perhaps in another 15 years with enough whining, CCP will just delete wars. Why would I not want to be involved with discussion about my gameplay?
---
What is there to relearn about not having neutral logi? You kee it in-house and you push the same buttons as we did before... except this time the only people shooting at our logi are war targets, and not war targets + a system full of random neutrals.
---
What changes where we can’t camp in bling ships?

You're under the assumption they dont already do that.
---
Exactly. The new 'blanket cost' for a wardec kinda confirms it: there used to be a sliding scale based on the number of members in the target corp, and the average is fairly close to the bottom of that, meaning the majority of war targets were corps with single digit membership. Career wardeccers don't want content, they want to gank without getting concordokened or risk going into low/null/wh space. Why should that "reward without risk" be rewarded more than some player who just wants to pootle about high sec solo or with a couple of friends?

It could be a lot of fun, for one time we will be in the defensive side since end of 2016

&gt; Everyone is a target to someone, and why should industrial-based corps in Highsec be exempt from this? Let’s be honest here, there’s plenty of groups that don’t reside in Highsec that are planting their flag in Highsec as well. Lots of gangs roaming through, industry alt corps, and such. Let’s say I owned and operated a network of Azbels in a 0.5 and Pirat came to destroy them... I would use the resources I have to network and find partners that would fight on my behalf or assist me in pushing them off.
---
&gt; Why do we feel like everyone has to go through this MMO experience alone? You see your Astrahus sitting right here? Well a few thousand kilometers away is another Astrahus that belongs to another player - perhaps he is interested in interacting with you.
---
I don't see what you're issue here, if those industrial corps own structure, go and wardeck them ?
---
&gt; Highsec definitely has a proper place in this food chain. You offer me as an example of wanting this because we’d be at the top of this chain, but that’s false. We currently already have groups and individuals that are good at catching and killing us - like I said everyone is a target to someone. I challenge you to take some time flying around highsec, and you’ll see an area where Nullsec groups are coming to hangout because they are tired of a stagnant Nullsec, areas where Nullsec groups are setting up markets, and so much more... all these are reasons for larger and stronger groups to be in and among highsec and if you’re at war with Pirat, is a reason to fight and interact. All I’m suggesting is that we shift from N+1 gameplay and have the end objective be destroying ships.
---
Yes, except it use to be about destroying ship, and it was shit. If you want to freely destroy ship, go to LS or NS ? Nullseccer come to HS because there is money to make of structure, that's all. You don't see them outside of that.
---
&gt; That sounds a lot like what Nullsec groups do when they deploy to an area to farm the residents, strange. Hm, it also sounds like what Lowsec groups do. Surely our honorable Wormhole friendos are above this behavior of picking easy fights... hm, sounds a lot like some wormhole evictions.
---
Yes, except those groups are people who went in LS / NS / WH knowing this could happen. That's part of it. That's not what HS should be. HS should be a proving group for corp to live until they need to move out to get content and/or better farm. And if they want to try out baby PvP, they can anchor structure and try to defend it. But wardeck only about ship killing, we all know how it's going to turn out. It's been that way for years and it was utterly one sided. Way, way more than LS/NS/WH conflicts can be. Ridiculously one sided.
---
I’m not sure that it specifically confirms your suspicions. I think lots of people have had issues with the general cost of wars and wanted to see an increased cost around the board, but specifically against smaller groups so that they are better protected.

I used to do vanguards and assaults a lot and the insane lock speed of some rats are normal imo. I stopped doing HQs back in the day when they were little known because I lost about 3 basis in 8 sites.

If you do actually want to encourage content (ie the newbies who got wardecced to actually undock and fight), there needs to be a way to level the playing field. I have yet to see anything that isn't an outright gank from a wardeccers, and it's pretty demotivating to be always outnumbered and outclassed in terms of ship.
---
Maybe something similar to the killright mechanic? So, your wardec targets all have a killright on them, set by Concord with a cost based on the difference in your ship costs (so if you attack a Gila in a Gila, free claim, but a Proteus wanting to attack a Tristan needs to cough up some cash). Each n+1 that wants to join in gets a modifier to dissuade blobbing (eg the second Gila joining you versus that Gila gets their estimated ship value doubled, and so has to pay to join in, third buddy tripped, etc.). This wouldn't stop those who actually get off on ganking helpless newbs, because nothing will and they have the means to fund it, but it means that they might be encouraged to downgrade ships and/or numbers to only be slightly better than their target, and give the target hope that they could actually get somewhere by fighting back, meaning they sometimes will. It also discourages the kind of gameplay I saw in our last wardec, where a gang of three Vedmarks sat camping an NPC station and killing a member's rookie ship every time she undocked to try to go get more ships to actually fight with, meaning she eventually got bored, dropped corp, and logged off (we had someone actually willing to engage in combat, even highly imbalanced, and they were actively stopping that happening to add more easy green).

Why do we need to rely on something artificial to level the playing field? I’m using the strategies I employ and flying the ships that I do, and you can easily match or counter those strategies and ships.

If you don’t want to get caught, not getting caught is a good place to start.

1 boosh ship can counter a subcap logi wing as they'll end up out of range of the rest of the fleet.

1 boosh ship can counter a triage as it moves the subs out of range.
---
&gt; I'm using the strategies I employ and flyimg the ships that I do, and you can easily match or counter those strategies and ships.
---
My point is, the targets of wardecs normally _can't_ match and counter: they don't have the SP and/or the isk to jump into blingy ships of the level most wardeccers use.
---
&gt; If you don't want to get caught, not getting caught is a good place to start.
---
Exactly. Per my example later, the best option is to not undock, drop corp, and/or not log in until the wardec is done. This is exactly the attitude that is causing the lack of content, and which career wardeccers _claim_ to want to fix.
---
&gt; If you want to fight, then fight. Don't expect some easy bullshit where you ought to be able to effortlessly try and expect to win.
---
Literally my point. Wardeccers want easy wins, and should at the very least have to choose between "cheap" or "easy". I'm sure even if you fit up a Gila and I fit up a Gila (as per my example) and you jumped me, 1v1, you would win hands down, because you can afford to bling it and Tech2+ it whereas my ass that's been playing less than 8 months simply cannot. But at least in that situation I'd try to fight back, make it fun for both sides before I lose. Current setup means I'll get jumped in my meta'd up Gila by three blingy Lokis, and may as well just alt-tab and think of England until they get their jollies because it's pointless to try. 
---
Well...   that’s only step one.   Now you must trash/destroy that plex, otherwise you’ve accomplished nothing.

\*Rapid Light Missile Launcher II raises his eyebrows\*
---
If the wardec system changes so that wars can be won by knocking down either party's war HQ, that will certainly stir up the pot for these ultimate pubbies who like to sit in blingy ships camping trade hubs with a group of neutral logi and scouts on every gate in a 2j radius.
---
I sincerely hope CCP realize how there is no positive aspect to these bottomfeeders keeping wardecs on every big party ingame 24/7/365  and sitting in the tradehubs killing those who don't know there's a war.
---
So, i guess the main thing that prevents mass usage of this tactics is how expensive fitting up both carrier and smaller ships will be. But then again, the whole idea of being one-man army certainly excites me.
---
....wow....just wow.....
---
But it's legal. It says right there in the ad.
---
People who only plex 1 or 3 accounts are more likely to quit with a higher plex price, not less.

The rorq farmer will just grind an extra 3 hours a month, it's not gonna break him. They are clearly tryhard enough to not give a shit about 3 hours of extra time to play for free , the casual player with a few accounts will  not be as willing 
---
we are never gonna see a return of the 1-3 acc player being the norm, it would require some drastic changes from ccp but why would they take that giant risk by cutting off the legs of their moneymaker game and seeing if it can still run after 
---
Can a scanning toon reliably achieve a "3-step zoom in" if I have T2 Pinpointing rigs?

Yes, a little bit more RAM will be used as a side effect of the 64 bitness.
---
Incursion rats have crazy lock speed, this is pretty normal imo. When I lived in lowsec it was a known thing that if there's an incursion in a constellation, trying to gate through solo in anything bigger than a frigate was most likely going to eat shit.
---
I agree, neither Provi nor HTP+ themselves really matter to TEST or PanFam in the upcoming war. But we do have strategically valuable *assets* that may impact it. Your Camal keepstar, notably, has range on Legacy territory, so PanFam could use that to stage attacks against them.
---
Plus there's plenty of things a small, otherwise insignificant 3rd party, can do to screw with the operations of larger forces. Unlikely to be anything that will ultimately affect any high-level outcomes, but often the smallest thing can decide the outcome of individual battles. - Maybe a group of Provi bubblers can keep PanFam supers on grid long enough for TEST to show up and kill them, or maybe HTP can manage to pause some TEST citadel long enough for PL arrive and finish it off. Small things like that.
---
Maybe we won't show up to bubble those supers if we can't be sure whether TEST will show up to kill them or save them.
---
This is why "Legal" can hit this google add pretty hard.

I love love love the look of the Absolution. I can fly one, I just can't think of any reason to as the Damnation is so much beefier for fleet fights and Abso is too slow for nano/small gang. It's got to the point I'm considering a PVE fit just to fly the fucking thing lol.
---
Legal only in NULl. 
---
I hope ccp adds ore hold expanders.
---
You can find a thing to do solo or even find a way to be useful in a corps with limited time in game. Best tip is to avoid grinding for ISK and just buy your liquid. 
---
Well the reference pic was a Golem, in 2015...
---
We’re the good guys. 
---
will it increase profits though? 
---
a person that wants 30b to buy a super or something has to buy less plex now than before. 
---
the people who spend 15$ a week on plex might have to only buy 4 plex in 5 weeks now rather than 4 in 4

Siege up, tell drones to hit spod, go and feed fedo and drive your racecar in the fleet hangar

Ship dragracing?

Fleet hagar bar and saloon module?
---
Two things.
---
1. The game is free to play, or more accurately has a free unlimited trial period. So you don't have to dish out money just to give it a try. If you enjoy it you can subscribe for the full experience. And for the love of Bob, do subscribe instead of grinding ISK to plex the account.
---
2. You train skills in real time. So your character will progress even if you go AFK for a month. So as long as have enough fun while playing to make the monthly subscription feel worth it you are good. Sure your piloting skills will take longer to develope but you can have fun doing it.

If logi were brought to near uselessness where nobody used them, getting fights would boil down to: do we have more dps ships than they do? no? ok we can't fight them - set destination to home and freeburn there.
---
Thats how I felt about the Abaddon lol
---
Love the curse and pilgrim, they are the reason I trained recon ships
---
Levi is a great looking one for sure
---
Their accent is russian as well as a lot of their naming is Russian
---
Its probably enough for a whole other topic. But yes, the consistency on navy ships is all over, especially in the cruiser line. Frigate/Battleship line is semi-consistent, even if some battleships are lackluster/not compatible with the meta.
---
You have some navy ships like the VNI that out dps' pirate ships (even its drone counterpart the Gila), then you have other navy ships like the Stabber fleet which only does like 15 more dps than a T1 Stabber before drones and is also slower than its t1 counterpart. Then as per the post, the CNI which is just wasted potential no matter how you slice it.
---
Personally, i'd like if we stopped looking at progression as T1 -&gt; Navy -&gt; Pirate and more as T1 -&gt; Navy &amp; Pirate.
---
Navy = General improvement
---
Pirate = Unique improvment
---
So navy gets EHP/DPS/Fitting buffs that are competitive with pirate ships, while pirate ships get the unique bonuses not found in any other ship.
---
Much excited, very wow.
---
If someone wants to submit a report to ccp that would be much appreciated. I'll remove it then as well

---
Gotta know your target audience.
---
Filthy casual... 
---
Whoever says that is BSing (almost). There's definitely some truth to that, but it depends on what you're doing. You can definitely enjoy the game with 5-6 hours a week, but you might not do anything "major" with those hours. But from my experience, some of the major stuff you do isn't any more fun than say, small gang roaming, brawling, or just doing explo etc etc.
---
It's going down at 1 in the morning on a thursday where I live :(
---
Okay, so it's a isk/hour issue then i take it. How do you make your isk and how much would you say you roughly make per hour? Even with a pretty low income you can whelp a lot of t1 stuff since it insures really well. The t1 cruiser line has some really good ships that doesn't cost a fortune to loose, it's all about pvping within your means.
---
Obviously you can throw away faction ships and T3s if you have a good income, but don't let the price of such ships keep you from pvp if you don't.
---
I’d start to sub for omega. One day your time will expand and you’d look back wishing you subbed to train into certain things. But to start out there is a alpha free thing. Honestly eve doesn’t need u on the game 24/7 to “level up” your skills are trained in real time. Just keep updating the skill que (phone app helps). Lastly if you have low time you can always spend 20$ on plex then sell it in game and bam you have funds for a month or two to do some ganking, faction warfare, setting up ships for soe arc. Ect. Eve is a great game. I’d start as soon as you can. 
---
Agreed. 
---
Given the volume traded in game remains stable whilst the price increases may (and likely does) mean the actual total "accessible" volume is shrinking.

Sry but what is ACL?

---
The legion is dead. Long live the damnation.

Beautiful
---
It's coming... 
---
Keep in mind this is a measurement of price based on the volume of sale over a specific time, and is subject to manipulation. For example, if someone wants to make the prices of something they are buying look artificially low or high--making their low buy orders look great by having people filling their buy orders not get the 'below value' warning or to make their high sell orders look great by having their customers not get the 'above value' warning. 
---
They do this by either setting up a buy order for a large volume of something they already own at a non-hub station for a very low value, then fill it themselves or they set a very high sell order for a large volume of an item they buy themselves. 
---
More bots = more demand

Margin orders is a life saver and all and really extends your play withe the market but I made more isk from importing across regions. I could not keep stock high enough with just people filling buy orders. 
---
Imagine being so shit you are the 500th person to post the Eve Pulse Falcon face today. I wish mods would start deleting this shit :/
---
there is no sign of nationalism. Line members do not have an idea why we are going to fight FRT. Tenerifis isn't crowded imo. From this merge we got a good number of FCs and more fleets to fly, FCs got more members in their fleets and more doctrines to use, this is the only reason. 
---
Why should xix fight TESTs? They gave us a home, they helped during the previous war and they are nice overall 
---
Yes, a bit of hate we have, broken NIP during the war in insmother for a silly reason, FRT bitterness. but meh
---
It's not related to anything to do with processing power or server loads. CCP has designed eve on the simple principle that they don't "trust" the client. Meaning that while you use the client to input controls it doesn't rely on the client for any information. This is a great way to severly cripple alot of basic cheating methods, since most of them rely on changing things in the client. 
---
Allowing the switching of characters would require trusting the client when it says "i'm already logged into account x". which would require a host of added security features to ensure people can't use it to hack into other accounts. So it would mean a complete client overhaul, bloating it with alot of security to prevent exploits and even then allowing for alot more security risks just to take away one minor annoyence.

Technically...technically...it's not illegal in a strict law sense. It's against the rules of the game and such, but by letter of the law it's not illegal I believe. If I chose to buy $2,000 worth of ISk or whatever from a website, the police are not going to come to my door with a warrent, I could walk into a police station and provide all the proof I bought the isk (bank statements, transaction ID, the works) and they would be like 'Yeah, and? You didn't break any law, stop wasting our time'. I would never do it as I have no need, isk is easy as fuck to make in the land of milk and honey of Delve. It just has to be said. All your doing if you buy isk or RMT is breaking the EULA that the company has in place and they CAN terminate your accounts etc, but no law has been broken.
---
Now saying that, I abhor all these sites selling services, currency, leveling services, boosts and items/gear HOWEVER they exist due to a demand, it's simply people finding a niche and exploiting it, in more ways than one, to the detriment of the game. I hate it but it is what it is
---
compare the depth of buy vs sell orders. Spooky.
---
It gets compensated by people like me, who only buy PLEX if they see the price going high enough. Frequent buyers who use it to fund their wallet consistently will need to buy less, infrequent buyers whom like to exchange RL cash now and then to pad their wallet but dont bother untill they see good value for for their money prices will be inclined to buy more without the need for a sale.
---
RMC got an offer, sell or sell PB :)
---
&gt; How do you pick your items?
---
look at doctrine ships. buy the modules and ammo. set buy orders in jita for them. camp them for a few days until they fill. not necessarily 0.01 isking every 10 minutes, more like 5% of buy/sell spread a couple of times a day.
---
once they fill contract to JF service to get the hauled to staging. sell them at a decent profit for your efforts, but dont gouge the newbeans too much. mostly because you'll attract more sellers if the profits look like they are too high.
---
I know this is sacrilege, but in a perfect world CCP would not have given up on Incarna and would have, even if they did not add any 'combat' had allowed people to walk around stations to do things, including socialize. 
---
PS. CCP, had you done this you could have had 'gambling machines' that could be installed in stations, which would have been the greatest isk sink ever. In fact, you still could without incarna avatars. Just an idea.  
---

Hard to identify a "soul" as you call it... Are you assuming that people with multiple accounts use the same e-mail address for all of them or do you have another plan for tying them all together?
---
no one is crying, they're just stating that indeed they called another coalition (goons) to hold their hand while panfam did nothing but act as a coalition defending their shit, or are we assuming that NC.PL had nothing on perimeter as well? bottom line is tapi can't handle a war they themselves picked and needed outside help
---
The entire idea is to sell your excess skill points on the market. Much like selling unused PLEX on the market.

TLDR, you are dumb as fuck.

i had days where stock was very low, in fact the last two days have been that way because I haven't had a lot of time to update orders.  if this were my main form of income i would consider it low.  this was more of an experiment to see how successful i could be at raising net worth without undocking.  the items i deal with move very slowly...some only see 1 or 2 sells in the entire region every couple of days but the margin spread is massive.  my most profitable item i bought at 34m and sold at 164m.  i sold two of them throughout the month.  the highest profit percentage item i bought at 600k and sold for 5-6m.  with a higher isk investment there is a higher spread generally and i never really jumped into the "big boy" market.  my highest buy order is 133m for instance where some buy orders run close to/over 1b.  i hope this helps you understand how my version of the market game ran.  :)

Kelmac convoed me and we agreed to work together 2 hours before the time. He convoed me after Vily and PGL told bliss they wouldn't be defending.
---
so all you need to do is install multiple launchers? Like you had to do before anyways? 
---
Yeah it'ts not spin. I don't blame Kelmac or Test line but Vily can take a dive.
---
Prices don't hurt people, people do 
---
But that's kind of my point... I can have an omega and two "fully trained" alphas across three accounts for the price of one; why can't I have the same on a single account for the same $/ISK price?
---
I understand "soul bound" to mean bound to the *account* you extracted them from.  That is to say, one of the 3 alts on the account.
---
I quite like this idea actually.  The more draconian version is allowing them to only be used on the character they were extracted from.  I'd be OK with this too.
---
Make Skill Training Great Again.
---
its the ratio of supply and demand that matters. I think its the supply of plex that is hurting..
---
Probably the only point in all of this you suggested was placing some kind of time gating on injection.
---
It could even scale like old fatigue to have a real impact. Only need to inject 2 injectors? You can do it in 5 minutes. Need to inject 20? You'll end up with cooldown over 10 days or something.
---
It would incentivize smaller injection spurts on characters, which would reduce consumption rate a little on the market.
---
I like it :D
---
Well I never did undock my market toon either.
---
Public couriers! 
---
Imagine always having an item in stock. Sure the spread will be less but without any stock means you aren't doing much.
---
I did regional importing on about 150 items earning a measly 300m per day. Sure my buy orders sat at about 20b but still it didn't get filled all that much. 
---
*laughs in one account*
---
It's completely devalued skills, skill training and "vet" status in Eve, as well as encouraged some people to create tens, scores, hundreds of alts to "farm" the SP.  Overall I think it's totally destroyed the culture of the game and turned it into something completely other than it used to be.
---
Us vets, who've been around since the beginning, have watched it happen.  You newbros really don't know.
---
That is indeed true, didn’t think of that. However prosecution of sites for trademark infringement can be very hard due to the countries most of these sites are registered in not really enforcing them. Hate to say it but many of those dodgy site owners are not stupid so protect themselves from trouble
---
If you stay as an alpha clone you can play completely for free. The only thing you'd have to log in for is to update your currently training skills as alphas can only have up to 24h skill queue (if a skill takes longer than that it's fine you just need to update the queue when the skill is finished).
---
Try a few different things. Look them up on youtube maybe. Things like exploration, faction warfare, hauling, pve. But honestly as it's free as an alpha clone you don't have to play a lot at all. 1 hour a month is fine as you're not losing real life money to pay a sub
---
So what? There is always someone in gaming that plays more, has more alts, or has more "stuff".
---
What you are saying, is that you expected "time played" to always give you an advantage, and with injectors that advantage is gone.
---
What we "know", is that some "vets" don't appreciate the even playing field. 
---
Nice. All those buy orders from the last few years are turning into a nice investment.
---
And that is why they do not allow multiple alpha accounts. One Alpha or multiple Omega accounts is the rule
---
I also looked through every ship and decided I loved the Stratios. I had to get the ship and after looking through the skins I decided I needed the black and gold one. (Yeah yeah skins on cloaky subcaps is stupid) Anyway I bought the ship and skin, now I just need bling and lvl 5 skills to actually use it :D
---
You are missing also the "time"
---
Of course "time played" should give you an advantage.  Why wouldn't it?
---
“No multiple Alphas” - That’s what I was missing, I just forgot since so many people do it with multiple emails. Thanks man
---
Well no since multiple accounts can train in parallel. It would be the same.
---
That's pointless... if I want 150k sp I'll train it, rather than spend 3x as long training 500k, to extract it, to inject it.
---
I agree and that's the problem. I started off as a small group / solo wardec'er, so I know how it feels to need to be able to afford wars. Luckily I was good at diplomacy so I negotiated plenty of surrenders, which helped fund future wars.
---
Your statement is pretty much true about anything though. Unless it's specifically designed to help one group but not another, any change is going to be taken advantage most by larger groups.
---
Tidi bro. Both us and FRT we trying to get though the gate, no one could do anything. Also we had no order to engage.
---
Falcons are dead m8
---
Because skill matters, and should be the only thing that matters.
---
If you need time played as a crutch, well then there you go.
---
Lore. Rabbit (right?) is a former Caldari who stole their tech for Guristas. Or something like this. It’s not entirely arbitrary 
---
And, you know, the massive public outrage over it. My how time flies.
---
When the JonLajoie-Rap-Version is coming ?
---
If the moving average is up you'd have to justify the assumption that trading Plex for profit went up or otherwise come to the conclusion that demand went up. Many here made a strong argument for that. Demand for alt-Rorqs + winter season that'd be. What could cause an increased interest in trading Plex for tradings sake within the last two months? I don't see that. Also wouldn't increased trading activity keep the price low if demand doesn't actually catch up?
---
so courier contracts would help with moving the items but you would still have to go to the region to update the buy orders.  travel time is costly in terms of "im moving instead of updating orders" kinda thing.  if you had a trade alt in each hub then that problem would be solved but i didnt want to get that involved.  also, couriers cut into profit which would then require at least one more function on the spreadsheet and then it boils down to that lazy thing i talked about earlier :)
---
It gets counted twice but not how you think.
---
When someone buys plex it is Unearned Revenue.
---
When the plex gets consumed it is actually Revenue because performance has happened.
---
Amateurs study tactics, experts study logistics. True logistics, not that healing crap.
---
P.S. Love to all logi pilots, thanks for keeping us alive!
---
&gt; CCPlease get rid of skill injectors.
---
If they did, they'd probably go bankrupt. Like it or not, skill trading became a huge source of revenue for them and kept them afloat even while subs were dropping off.
---
www.google.com
---
23.5 hours daily
---
Well I spent 186.001b in January in the last 1.8999 months.
---
Demand has been what you'd expect when Omega account with 5.5m so can be extracted and subbed with Plex for almost 0 cost. All the people talking about rorqs are also saying this, u can have a rorq army with some effort and a bit of startup. 
---
So this  is where the huge demand is coming from, sure. What I am saying is that the supply (ppl buying Plex for _ from CCP) never went up to match when demand Rose from injectors/ extractors.
---
Not what I suggested was it.  It's something of *value* to players, or used to be.  It's more cultural than mechanical.  It's not even necessarily gameplay related.  The culture of Eve has been changed by injecting and extracting.  Plex did that too. The game now has an "arcade"-type feel to it.  It's more casual.  More, dare I say it, "pubbie".  In-game events matter far less than they used to to the people involved in them.
---
I wouldn't expect you to understand as you probably weren't playing way back.   
---
FTL based ship repairs during battle?
---
Autopilot for those with no worries.
---
Get ganked, you'll be freed from the burdens of Freighter ownership! 
---
Bitter about it? Don't worry! Your cargo will go towards buying more Talos to gank the next freighter, everyone will know your pain!
---
Pretty much. The main ones that share empire designs are Serpentis and Guristas, both of whom are tangled up with their empire equivalents in the lore.
---
Side note: the Daredevil was actually designed for Serpentis by the Angel Cartel (Serpentis &amp; Angels are super best friends in the lore, Guardian Angels have a few NPC stations in Fountain and everything.) That's why Daredevil is the only Serpentis ship that has a unique design and doesn't start with V.
---
Oh yeah. I agree, supply most definitely didn't catch up. But it's not necessarily going down either (could be, tho, we'd probably notice in a few months)
---
It might not inject raw isk into your wallet, but minerals are worth ISK and those rorqual alts, that wouldn't otherwise exist, need plex to run.
---
&gt;but there's a program that boasts you can make billions while at work
---
I never understood the bots getting away with running 23/7. It should be ridiculously easy for CCP to identify a bot if he's hitting X million in ticks every hour for 20+ hours or hauling in X ore per hour for the same length.
---
It might be WIN 7 Professional 64-Bit with classic screen, imho the only viable Microsoft OS until WIN 10 has the same stability. Everything between Win 7 Pro and Win 10 was utter crap.
---
I run Eve on an Atari console likes real man
---
I've been at this game for 15 years.  I love the fact that people can inject their toons.  
---
By some vets I think you mean carebears and complacent rorq pilots.  Food isn't real people.
---
It does.  There is a lot more to this game than SP.  I've torn apart admittedly injected 20M SP cruiser pilots with a cyno alt.  Doing something for over a decade gives you a lot of time to learn how to get inside someone's OODA loop and make them eat shit.
---
Yup, well even if supply hasn't been changing. Demand has been going up for sure because of the injectors bit.
---
I looked last night and the depth of buy orders is MASSIVE vs the sell depth. It's possible everyone is just hoarding right now, but I won't be selling mine since there's no reason for price to come down, or even stop rising.
---
I feel like I am inside a dream looking at that. 
---
I can dig it.
---
Where would you suggest I go? I've had plenty of fun with wardecs. If you're open to some light reading, I can show you why I like wars so much.

Yet another instance where CCP slap a dronebay on a ship and expect people to consider it a buff compared to visiting and reworking the bonuses.
---
Sound familiar? They did this with the eagle and the zealot and fools blinded by ignorance and the thirst for some change in this game regard it as the buff both ships needed.
---
It's a lazy change; the best part of which I find is that to accomplish this change in drone bandwidth, they will open and edit a database of values. The same one they could do so for every broken or underpowered ship in the game.
---
Absolutely maddening. Don't be fooled by these lazy changes; we should continue to demand more.
---
Off season in 2 months and maybe a CCP sale could calm it down. But there'd have to be another significant change to the game or Plex by CCP to stop the general trend I think.
---
Same principle though; increased demand.
---
https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/208289645-Access-Lists
---
&gt;You just can't count it twice
---
Pretty much this. That dollar, pound, euro, yen spends once per transaction.
---
Also, not every plex is injected right into the market. Some players buy skins while others get extractors or add training queues. CCP needs PLEX buyers to survive now that it's F2P.
---
I mean, run a locator if you can find the strength to alt-tab away from your rorq account m8. As for Tarkov you can find me on there 24/7 under the username "UrMumIsAWh0re"
---
2019 NC = facts are damage control
---
It makes you minerals, which you can sell for isk, to buy PLEX.
---
Well, To extend on your example, In lore its up for debate who stole the designs from who. Some people say the gurista's stole it off the caldari, Others thing the caldari stole it from the gurista's
---
Yes definitely. My soft spots were the Kronos, Panther, and Moros. Still are, even though none of them are particularly amazing ships compared to the other races versions.
---
Yes exactly as you say.. We saw this exact thing  last year. Remember that string of sales? It was the only thing holding down the Plex price. This year we don't have one of those yet, and here we are.  
---
&gt; If the wardec system changes so that wars can be won by knocking down either party's war HQ, that will certainly stir up the pot
---
Oh, I absolutely agree. I think it's going to be a lot of fun either way. I would just prefer if it was going to be more than N+1. I wish Highsec had more mechanics that enabled strategic superiority, such as booshing.
---
&gt; I sincerely hope CCP realize how there is no positive aspect to these bottomfeeders keeping wardecs on every big party ingame 24/7/365 and sitting in the tradehubs killing those who don't know there's a war.
---
Come on dude, you know this is the absolute highest form of PVP. Take a look at my stats dude, and tell me otherwise...
---
https://zkillboard.com/character/2112217856/
---
dont they own more regions or is it a similar amount of systems 
---
At some point....
---
&gt;  It will not because Mr. Numbnuts #2 will still re-list his sell at 19,999,999.99 on his next update cycle. All you have done is cut yourself and everyone else out of 5m profit. 
---
So much this. Excuse me while I biomass my Jita alt -_-
---
CCP - You wouldn't say that in AUTZ
---
I would change injectors into drugs that speed training up for a month. 50 plex gets 1X removed from the skill you're training (minimum train time of 1X) while 500 plex will buy you an injector that removes 5X 1000 PLEX gets you a reduction of 10X. 
---
This would mean there's still be a minimum 1X train time for any skill to level five but you could play catch-up if you were willing to spend the PLEX/ISK and there would no longer be extractor farms or insta cap pilots.
---
Outrage?
---
Back in the day bubble fucked gates were much more common. Now that anchorable bubbles have a limited life time people tend to be more restrictive in where they place them. So traveling around isn't too difficult even without nullification. Sure nullification helps when an interdictor lands on top of you, but that is something which is entirely avoidable if you pay attention to your surrounding.
---
TL;DR is use an Astero.
---
What is krabbing?
---
Same here, naked gnomes and night elves flood the streets at night....
---
Since when can you not have multiple alpha accounts? I know you can only have one logged in at a time but I never seen that you can only have one alpha account
---
Look like shit. I love it!!
---
What you don't' *dual* super rat, you don't deserve to play
---
Please stop joking about that, I'm not kidding with that shit.
---
We're currently wardecked and I'm out of ships. Managed to scout my non-neutral DST into Jita, just docking everytime I . Filled it with ships, used 2 scouts including a neutral one to look at the gates and undock. Undocked it, warped to the far undock BM and cloaked it.
---
War target ceptor landed 4km away from it. Shit my pants. He just warped back to the station. My scout see Sin and shit undocking from times to time, and I'm like shit I might they might just warp at it again when they are all ready for a decloak and just uncloak with drones.
---
After a while just warped back at the station because didn't feel like it was a good idea to risk traveling. Lesson of the day : use an out of grid BM.
---
&gt; My point is, the targets of wardecs normally can't match and counter: they don't have the SP and/or the isk to jump into blingy ships of the level most wardeccers use.
---
What are you basing this off of? Look at my killboard and tell me what kind of players I'm killing: https://zkillboard.com/character/2112217856/
---
Strange, it doesn't look like I'm specifically targeting new players. DELET THIS.
---
&gt; Exactly. Per my example later, the best option is to not undock, drop corp, and/or not log in until the wardec is done. This is exactly the attitude that is causing the lack of content, and which career wardeccers claim to want to fix.
---
That certainly is one strategy. While not playing the game or not undocking is the ultimate safeguard against getting PVP'd, I can think of plenty of ways that players can keep themselves "safe" during war.
---
To your last point (I don't feel like quoting)... Does all player-driven content have to be fun for both sides? Winning is fun when I win. I personally can have fun when I lose as well. I kill people that still manage to find fun or at least humor out of it, and it's most certainly fun and entertaining when someone kills me (profitable as well).
---
- Is getting smartbombed in lowsec fun for the victim?
---
- Is getting cyno baited fun for the victim?
---
- Is getting your mining ship bumped out of range of asteroids fun for the victim?
---
- Is having a diplo steal your alliance's Keepstar, leaving hundreds or thousands of players fucked, fun for the victims?
---
- Is having your space burned down fun for the victims?
---
I can list literally every single way in which we can interact with each other and almost assuredly say that fun is not always had. 
---
I know something about the economy. Its called get a job and just pay for your sub.
---
You don't know shit. 
---
Where are you living that a pint is over £4.20? London?
---
Injectors are only a problem as long as people are buying them for more rorq alts etc. Eventually their prices will crash massively.
---
yes when ever snuff is loosing the sub cap fight (which is most of the time) they deploy the no skill instant win cyno good times and fun for both sides
---
Add up your karma from this post = the amount of actual votes you’ll receive for CSM.   
---
I can't wait for PLEX to be 20B
---
See ya retard
---
I see someone has taken accounting 101.  Now you've just gotta work on context and application instead of just recognizing terms.
---
Sales are a double-edged temporary solution to bigger on-going economic and gameplay issues that could by itself become a major issue ( conditioning players to wait and only buy plex on sale ).
---
Bad idea.
---
If I win a seat on the CSM will you upvote one of my posts? Perhaps I can make you a nice meme using a state of the art meme generator?
---
Treating symptoms not issues.
---
I'd rather see a sub sale than a plex sale.
---
&gt;"If you can't afford the buck, you don't deserve to play"
---
How is expecting players to be able to pay the standard subscription rate, which has remain unchanged for years, a shocking proposition? Furthermore, how is it shocking that when you can no longer afford to PLEX, you can still play with access to a not insignificant number of ships and features without paying a dime?
---
It isn't sustainable. It's just going to drive more and more people away. 
---
Maybe in Block-Fleets from Imperium/Legacy or PanFam. For sure not in smaller groups with casual triple-boxing at least and no Umbrella ...
---
Nah fam
---
What an ignorant post
---
Why not?
---
Attention all epic internet spacewarriors ccp is in great danger To help them all you need is to sub your accounts But to do that all you need his your moms credit card and the tree on the back and the expiration month and date but you gotta be quick before pearl abyss kills them.
---
As in it's very good at dying?
---
&gt;as I'm strongly biased towards real-life tangible goods.
---
Maybe EVE is not the right game for you then.
---
And how many accounts should I pay for with real money? 
---
How do you figure?
---
Nice twisting of words there, but my post about kicking TH-R stands.
---
Alliance tax in GSF and TNT is 5%, not sure on BASTN/LAWN. It is not 15%.
---
&gt; The interesting thing is, the entire alliance is optimized for attraction of krabs and collection of taxes. 
---
We optimized our space to be good to live in, and have content and a management structure that can handle a lot of people. 
---
&gt;They get all these assets but do nothing with them to jeopardize the status quo and the farm.  No major wars, no sov invations, no breakup of the alliance or breakup of NIPs with TEST to ensure some wars happening. 
---
No-one would ever claim that you have much insight into the strategic posture and planning process of the Imperium.
---
&gt; Even their JB network was optimized for taxation rather than PvP content. 
---
This is just dumb. We have titans for bridging PVP fleets locally, and we have quite an effective bridge network going to the north.
---
&gt; They should have 50t to 100t accumulated in those alliance coffers past 3 years. I bet Aryth is trading with it, further growing it. Where the fuck does all this money eventually go though? Who knows. It all stinks like shit. That money could buy 2000-3000 titans. Nobody will ever lose/SRP that many in a war. 
---
See above. You literally cannot wrap your head around our long-term plans even if I were to tell them to you. Your accusations are retarded. And of course Aryth and others in the financial team is using the isk and assets amassed to grow it even further.
---
&gt; And I talk about Goon stuff because I have been in their space for a year now. I'm sure similar stories must be going on in other places. 
---
Some would say that you have an unhealthy obsession with the Imperium, maybe you should try a change of scenery?
---
Isnt it Serbian? Theyre similar, but I'm sure a Serb could point out the differences
---
What a retard argumentation. 
---
The enforcer, it looks cool, it’s cloaky, and it seems fun to fly
---
Good post 
---
On a scale between 0-200 , I would put this at a rough 85iq post 
---
haha, someone pay him to actually say that.
---
&gt; subscription rate, which has remain unchanged for years
---
whats your source?
---
&gt; you can still play with access to a not insignificant number of ships and features without paying a dime
---
would you not agree that high skilled alpha players should be able to grind to omega in a viable manner and that omega players should have an easier time that is not autist lvl?
---
Thank you
---
Agreed. Plex sale won’t solve anything - just lower the price short term (and I’m skeptical that will even happen). 
---
Op needs to get a grip. 
---
Haha it takes a special person to admit to that. I wish you the best in your epic quest to make yourself look like an absolute tool.
---
I don't follow these arguments?  "I want to keep playing this game for free while CCP eats the cost of hosting, staff, etc."
---
Perseus you're a literal smoothbrain.
---
Bart comments @Init.
---
What alliance are you in retard?
---
Hey bro. When plex goes to 20bln, I’ll sell you some at 19.5. Cool?
---
You underestimate the number of hardcore nerds in this game.
---
That 23/7 ratting account?......... Fair chance its one of those mentioned above.
---
Completely agree the bot problem is out of hand. Fortunately ccp has the perfect solution....
---
new skins are up for sale in the ccp store! Get them now while Eve is still around in 2 years when the rotting husk of eve is going offline you won’t be able to buy these amazing skins!
---
Oh no... 2B for a month now... it's like this server is following Chinas server before they shut it down where it cost 20B for 500 PLEX. Welcome to the death of the game. 
---
Enjoy.
---
Plex is 2bil. 
---
What do you mean play ?
---
Eve is real life.
---
In terms of how much time to commit, you can do as little or as much as you want. The problem is if you start getting hooked, the number of hours slowly creeps up. Also you will start to realise that there are so many things to organise and do that if you jump on for an hour, you might not even get to undock !!!
---
Honestly, you invest as much as you want to.
---
Stay Alpha for now, see how you go. Good luck.
---
*Spent my 1.2 trill on plex before going inactive which I made from rorq mining since last year. Since CCP is doing fuckall about the botters I figure I spend the rest of my isk on plex when heading out. I know a bunch of other people who are hoarding plex as well.*
---
*I guess one way to fuck botters is hoarding plex right? I know it fucks with the rest of the peasants out here who survive off plex but you are just collateral damage to CCP in order to have them do something about the bots.*
---
&gt; Why shouldn't people that PLEX be able to play ? 
---
No poors.
---
Mow your neighbors fucking yard for 15 bucks and sub the game.
---
This
---
Agreed
---
Heretic
---
Do you mean T2 pinpointing modules? Afaik, there are only probe strength rigs. In any case, a toon with all the scanning skills (and the covops frig) at IV, and using a sisters probe launcher + probes,T1 modules / rigs, and no implants, should be ok.
---
About the scanning time, I think it's 10secs without skills and can be reduced to 5secs with the acquisition skill at V and no modules and to 4secs with the T2 acquisition array. With the acquisition skill at IV and a T1 acquisition module, you'll be at 5.4secs.
---
Not worth training all those skills to V imho.
---
Jimmies rustled by a smoothbrain smh
---
One account is enough. You don't need more accounts. EVE is about playing together with others. Playing with yourself is dirty :-P
---
You do know that people who buy PLEX give money to CCP, so that if you sub with PLEX, CCP still is paid, you do know, that, right ?... ^right?
---
As many as you like! 
---
This has to be bait.
---
Nice to see you have time to quote 10 year old memes in between crayon eating sessions lmao
---
Depends on your income. For example, £4.24 /$5.62 gets you 110 plex which if sold will get you roughly 430,000,000 isk.
---
For an alpha or new player that should be plenty to be going on with.
---
If you can afford it, why not do it, it frees up all that time you would otherwise have spent grinding to make isk. Some people swear by grinding for their isk and not paying real money for it; that’s fine too, it is each to their own, and everyone has different financial situations. 
---
A PLEX sale will not help issues at all. The most it will do is incentivize more accounts and higher long-term prices.
---
The demand for PLEX must come down. This is because the supply of PLEX will not change that much. 
---
People who buy PLEX do so because they rather spend money for ISK rather than grind for it. By making ISK grinding so accessible it actually decreases the number of people who are incentivized to buy PLEX, since there is a viable alternative.
---
This is like treating a disease by taking painkillers, or treating an addiction by consuming more drugs. It feels better for a while but it doesn’t solve any underlying problems and instead increases dependency.
---
The problem is infinite scalability. Treat it at its source by shutting down the massive resource fountains and the need for so many accounts drops.
---
Drop the accounts across the board and the PLEX price recovers.
---
1) we need more isk sinks.  Right now when you get space rich, you just dump money into plex and hold because where else are you going to park you space trillions?
---
2) There is a huge problem with plex / extracting.  You can maintain omega for very little isk per month by plexing and extracting.  This is great for old players who don't need to train or alts that also don't need any further skills but is terrible for new players trying to skill up.  I don't have a solution for this, maybe raise the price of injectors so that breaking even on a skill farm or VNI farm alt is much harder?
---
Yknow my greatest regret with PLEX is thinking a sale was imminent and selling out at 3.7 lol.
---
All I see now are lost profits :(
---
&gt; whats your source?
---
Well, I've been playing for 7 years, and it's been $15/month (if you buy one month at a time) that entire time.
---
As many as you can afford. That's how money works
---
Ah, yes, that fight certainly looked like a lost fight. So glad we managed to drop titans on those deadly condors. 
---
Amen, I'd probably sub a couple of extra accounts on a sub sale than the ones I already pay for.
---
I think that's a decision you should probably make yourself?
---
someones snippy 
---
&gt;Yes its silly but there is a reason why it is done in real war even in modern day wars. What do you think corp/alliance names are? In game nationalities basically.
---
Says you.  They like Pandas.
---
Says you. --They like Pandas.
---
wow, next economic analphabet here bragging nonsense
---
&gt;would you not agree that high skilled alpha players should be able to grind to omega in a viable manner and that omega players should have an easier time that is not autist lvl?
---
Why?
---
The only reason you have to grind more isk is because everyone else is grinding more isk to pay for theirs as well. 
---
Supply and demand. PLEX is worth what people will pay for it.
---
maybe transfer your accounts to Serenity then, there we already had reached that goal ...
---
I used to make a killing in Jita when faction/deadspace/officer modules were contract only. Always double check those contracts before submitting.
---
I wondered where your harpy fleet went, if it makes it better horde removed them with talwars 10 minutes later
---
You do realize that Plex hasn't actually varied - it's always scaled with income, and typically hovered around 20-30 hours of the highest reasonably-achievable ISK-generating activity available.
---
Yes, it's currently around 2 billion. We also live in an era where carriers are cheap, can be injected, and can break 200M/hr if you go full autism (and supers can hit 300+).
---
Having a Plex sale won't change the inflation going on, and IMO Plex prices aren't done climbing either.
---
Go from Jita to 1DQ in a T1 battleship. Any fit, no jump gates. 
---
&gt;whats your source?
---
9 years of bank transactions.
---
&gt;would you not agree that high skilled alpha players should be able to grind to omega in a viable manner...
---
No, and it’s false to assume that PLEX is a promise by CCP or anyone else that any given player can easily, or even with moderate difficulty, play for free. 
---
&gt;...and that omega players should have an easier time that is not autist lvl?
---
Easier time doing what exactly? It’s a given that an omega player can have access to more powerful assets. That is literally the design of the system. But to imply that being competitive with the entire cluster and being able to have a reasonable degree of access are one in the same for everyone is obtuse. Contrary to popular belief, there is more to the game than high-end content like capitals and supers.
---
i want furry machariel
---
How important do you think the stasis web bonus will be now that fighter application and haw gun damage will be lower? I'm working towards a vanquisher atm, similar to your goal
---
sorry, but flair rather implies that you hoard PLEX with botted ISK ... *colbert*
---
Looks like the people to buy PLEX want more ISK for their PLEX. And looks like people other than yourself are willing to buy PLEX for the higher price.
---
Go to Serenity Server, there the Economy already had reached that healthy level of 20 Bil per Sub ...
---
You can have multiple alpha accounts.
---
Logging in multiple alpha accounts at the same time violates the terms of service.
---
Ive been playing Eve for 3 years, have been playing online games since they were text based, and have seen this chain of conversation literally hundreds of times.
---
Nostalgia is always there, just don't let it make you bitter. If you don't enjoy the game anymore, quit.
---
How much has the top quartile or something's ISK generating potential gone up in that time? That's who you're competing with. Not the average player, but those in the top 25% (or less) of ISK making, and there's been a lot of opportunities for those dedicated enough.
---
It'll fix getting memory pressured in massive fucking tidi brawls, crashing out as a result, then having to spend hours trying to get logged back in with a sane client. With war on the horizon I am very much so looking forward to this.
---
That's interesting
---
Oh I know why you like them and that's mostly why I'm glad they'll be going away.
---
"There's a sucker born every minute." -- P. T. Barnum

I just saw plex was like 2 billion, what the fuck is going on!?
---
\&gt;  trading bots make me want to dig my eyeballs out with a rusty fish hook. They are out there. I have screenshots of them as proof.
---
Could you share a few of those screenshots? I'm curious how you can tell that some order is from a bot from a single screenshot.
---
To be clear it doesn't mean less crashes... It means exactly one less cause of crashes...

What do you look for when searching for a place to settle down and trade?

Vindy looks awesome

The Wyvern, because [this picture](https://www.imgbase.info/images/safe-wallpapers/video_games/eve_online/26981_eve_online_caldari_fleet.jpg) is what got me playing in the first place.
---
But for quite a long time, I was convinced everything in this fleet was Minmatar because of the color scheme.
---
Yes, printing isk and devaluing isk is the solution!  YOU ARE AN IDIOT.
---
I rank it as "sandwich".
---
Because it sounds inbred

I don’t rat and rarely mine, when I mine it’s only noon goo, so none of this affects my revenue stream in anyway, but good try.

Put up full passive hull tank, add tackle mods, cyno and plenty of lquid.

Unless you meet someone dumb is along the way all people will ignore you after first scan :D

My dignity isn't worth that much.
---
What a constructive answer.
---
The tengu. I was an explorer when I started out in 2016. I was browsing the ship lists and saw all the different tech 3 ships and thought they looked super cool. As I did all the googling I could do it seemed that the Tengu was the best one and the stratios was a good stepping stone. But my lowsec corp moved to null and I became a vni orbitter. Its been awhile but I finally got my first Tengu sometime last year. Blinged out ready to roll I got to run a few combat sites and then I got tackled and died.... You live you learn. Continued to buy and lose a few more and now I am back to the vni.
---
1.2t is middle class these days
---
Apologies for such a late reply. Real life got alot messy :) Ty maybe i will try pressing those to buttons :) 
---
So the mod. Is it better for pvp?
---
He would have been more successful cornering the VNI bpc market or something 
---
Very interesting stuff happend to me recently. I ran out of PLEX, looked at PLEX prices and cried, then I started krabbing.
---
It's closer to room temperature IQ I think.
---
Free market in an economy that's poorly balanced and further imbalanced by botting.
---
2b is a shit ton of ISK for a lot of players. It's not a problem for me but I make 1-3b per day playing eve watching youtube.
---
I have been playing for 4y and I am subbing 5 accs atm so i am paying a fuckload irl money to have good content and fun in the game. 
---
what all of you retards miss is that higher plex prices mean less active accounts and therefore less content.
---
I have friends that are fucking trillionaires with 20 plexed accounts who downgrade to only 4 instead of 8 spy accounts...less blue eyes and less Content..less seeded dread alts etc.
---
ppl dont plex sabre alts anymore...lower chance to hold critical tackle...less content
---
friends dont plex all their farms anymore...less player related isk in the wallet...less ISK to throw away...less content
---
newbros not able to get that 2nd account going or even maintaining omega on main.
---
 
---
like i remember me VNI ratting in my first year. that income is still the same but expenses for plex doubled. now someone tell me thats a good thing. Bots and skill injectors fucked this whole thing up to a scale that was not closely present back when I started. I can only imagine that ppl have to spent all they gametime in the grindy persuit of ISK with the result of less time for pvp related shit. just compare the time needed to plex by vni ratting today and 4y ago. 
---
how are you expecting that the average player pays 100 bucks each month for a videogame
---
Irl got real busy :( 
---
So z-s is a certain mod? 
---
Maybe you as one individual don't target newbies. If that's the case, well done you. However, the issue is that a large number do, and the reason for the changes is to counter that abuse. I don't steal things, but still have to have security cameras around because others do; I don't get into car accidents, but still have to pay for insurance based on other people driving poorly. There's a lot of times we're inconvenienced because other people are dicks, and saying newbies shouldn't be protected from people exploiting a system just because you Ike the system is unrealistic at best.
---
And I'm not saying it always has to be fun for both sides, but if you want content, you need to make people want to undock. It will always be more fun for the winner, but if there's not even a 0.01% chance of survival, why would the future loser try? How fun is it if you hang in space because your opponent doesn't see the point in showing up? Point is, if it's not at least a little fun for the other guy, too, no one gets any fun: you can't win against an opponent that won't fight.
---
I drop a lot the prices when I notice a bot updating orders. If your order get outbitted always 4 mins later no matter the hour, you update your order until get minimum profit (sell order - buy order - taxes = 0,2 isk) so they go lower than you (for 0,1 isk) and then you update your price to the real one and let the bots keep their 0,1 isk profit order.
---
They won’t go if there’s 0 profit tho.
---
its always the goons fault though
---
Yellow box doesn't mean they are locking you. It means they have you locked but not agressed yet. 
---
There is no warning for someone or something locking you. 
---
wrong
---
I use an astero personally but I don't like null sec. Stratios is a good bigger boat that can explo/pvp
---
no they arent
---
Buy isk if grinding for it isn't fun for you. That said, there are so many ways to get isk in eve that even if you tried all of them for only a week you'd keep yourself entertained for many months. I don't buy isk, but I also don't grind isk to buy PLEX for my subscription. I just pay for 6 months at a time (and get a good discount). Then you can play when you want, and not worry about paying for next month's plex. 
---
I tend to just do what seems fun at the moment. Right now I'm running sites in high/low sec (combat mainly, just screwing around with escalations and stuff). When that gets boring I'll do some abyssal stuff because I haven't tried that out much yet, or may just pvp a bit, or whatever.
---
I personally wouldn't  buy PLEX to sell for isk, because I think part of the fun of a game is playing it and achieving your goals. Pulling out your wallet to get isk ruins part of the game for me. That said, if you feel obligated to grind for money and you hate it, buy plex. I would say you should pay for a subscription rather than try to grind it out, since that is excellent value (I think a 6 month subscription is like $12 a month). Just have fun! If something sucks and you're not having fun, but you want to, just try something new. And get some friends to play with!
---
This is exactly what i am looking for! :D thank you!
---
Thank you for the reply :)
---
Thank god there are mid packs :)
---
Ill go with combat 🐼

It means PvE.

Ayy lmao
---
thats bots/injector related and mainly based on players that are already in the top 30% wealth wise. dont tell me a newbro will be multiboxing rorqs and be therefore competitive
---
Why do you think I like them?
---
Right? I'm waiting for CCP to release some new ship skins that show up in tactical mode. Change the shape of each tiny little dot
---
Only a good guy with SP can stop a bad guy with SP. 
---
&gt;So the mod. Is it better for pvp?
---
 A custom overview pack is much better. I think SaraShawa is the most popular updated pack https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/ar406g/sarashawa_overview_pack_v_105_released/.
---
Just Join the ingame chat channel, "SaraShawa-Overview"  there are instructions how to install it. Its very very simple.
---
&gt; this is like an animal rolling over to show its not aggressive to an alpha
---
oh yeah, my favourite prey
---
There’s a lot more caps everywhere, but also a new patch aimed at nerfing fighter application to smaller ships. It’s still uncertain how this will all play out but a lot of people are looking forward to it.
---
I'm pretty sure that it's Guristas stealing and augmenting Caldari designs.
---
From the Worm's description:
---
&gt;Korako 'The Rabbit' Kosakami, Gurista leader, has a particular love for stealing the Caldari's ship designs, souping them up, and turning them on their creators. With the Worm, he has taken the Merlin design so familiar to Caldari pilots and turned it into a defensive powerhouse capable of firing its volleys at terrifying speeds.
---
Gila:
---
&gt;Taking what he had learned from his days in the Caldari Navy, Korako ‘The Rabbit' Kosakami, Gurista leader, decided that he would rub salt in the State's wounds by souping up their designs and making strikes against his former masters in ships whose layout was obviously stolen from them. To this end the Gila, bastard twin of the Moa, has served him well.
---
Caps show the same. Only one with some ambivalence about who copied who is the Rattlesnake:
---
&gt;In the time-honored tradition of pirates everywhere, Korako ‘Rabbit' Kosakami shamelessly stole the idea of the Scorpion-class battleship and put his own spin on it. The result: the fearsome Rattlesnake, flagship of any large Gurista attack force. There are, of course, also those who claim things were the other way around; that the notorious silence surrounding the Scorpion's own origins is, in fact, an indication of its having been designed by Kosakami all along.
---
The only real problems with the CNI are the price and 2nd trait.
---
As you said, it's supposed to kill smaller ships, which is why it's a great RLML platform. HAMs and Heavies, even with the bonus (as you yourself pointed out) just don't do the job.
---
When comparing the ship as a purely RLML platform you will see that it performs just as well as other ships of it's type, and moreover, is a straight buff of the bog standard Caracal. 
---
What makes it not worth flying is the price. at 14x the price of a standard Caracal it isn't worth undocking when other Navy ships do the same job for cheaper (an SFI being less than half the price).
---
So a good balance (not fix) would be to reduce the LP cost of CNIs and re-align the 2nd trait to be relevant to light missiles.
---
Just popping in to say I'm offended by the way you capitalized ISK.
---
They won't indeed, but a newbro in a venture shouldn't be able to pay for his account with plex.
---
If you want to plex, you need to be competitive income wise. 
---
I have literally been on a fleet where we killed a freighter in null in the middle of a belt. people really do this already (granted slightly different than actually assigning drones, but still).

Press F to pay respects. Balls made of steel

you could try [evemarketer.com](https://evemarketer.com) and look down the list of sell or buy orders,
---
or maybe try  [https://evetrade.space/](https://evetrade.space/) 
---
Not broken. It’s based on average prices for both buy and sell, it there’s very low/no buy order prices for a region the “average” will be much lower than the sell and you’ll get a warning. 
---
This is what making the game not worth it to play. 
---
you almost make it sound someone made a venture example...stop being a retarded.
---
ofc plexing should be a goal to work towards but it should be possible for a smart midbro with less then autist lvl gametime available
---
Thanks (not actually a Russian speaker).
---
I, too, have camped a gate with 200:1 k/d ratio
---
Thank you ! :D
---
1) If your arent sure hat to train for train the core skills https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/The_Magic_14
---
2) If you play the game long enough to fly a dread you'll have more than 1 account by that time. Until then fly what interests you, each factions ships are a little different. Amar ships for instance, are made to be Armor tanked (so ignore shields) and use lasers for weapons. 
---
1(a) You can speed tank so your ships so fast the enemy cants hit you, but that requires a knowledge a new player might not have. Maybe go for a drone boat (you stay out of range and just let your drones fly off to do the damage), for that you may want to look into gallente ships
---
I don't gatecamp.
---
Edinburgh.  There will be cheaper of course, but by and large it's overpriced as heck for everything.
---
But arn’t many of them alts
---
That's hardly true. If anything this post should bring Plex process down slightly.
---
Because most people are fucking stupid.
---
Including Eve players (being less stupid than most is still stupid)
---
1. Oh. My better cancel that shield thing. 
---
2. wait. More than 1 account? isnt that against the EULA? i think i've seen it somewhere. 
---
1(a). Drones are not my thing... Idk.. i just dont like drones in real life, and maybe that is why i hate drones in game? Plus, I hate republics of all kinds (this including my real nation xD)
---
Stiletto is the current best exploration ceptor.  I don't have a fit handy because I'm at work.
---
Hi and welcome to the game!
---
Okay so first of all, don't panic, the skill queue has gotten faster, but it's also expanded to being indefinite duration, with a cap at 50 skills being queued at one time (so you can easily pile on 30+ days of training at a time).
---
Skill Priority: 
---
Currently it's most beneficial to get the 'core' skills out of the way as they will give you the most bang for buck no matter what you fly. These core skills are commonly called the 'Magic 14', some details here: [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/The\_Magic\_14](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/The_Magic_14)
---
But they can be boring so feel free to insert more fun skills to fly in the meanwhile!  
---
I would also suggest joining a newbie friendly corporation to help you learn and develop (plus you will be surrounded by other newer players so its a great growth environment). I suggest EVE University personally (the link above is their wiki) because they are impartial from the larger space entities, but it is entirely your choice!
---
Good luck!
---
So you're mad that you're getting targeted ads when you have eve?
---
Offer an idea for a new income stream, then. Just getting rid of them will be like removing tracks with a high speed train approaching.
---
Snap! Maybe we should organise a Scotland meetup sometime?
---
Another thing missing here is that omega skills for non-training toons on a subbed account will sill be usable while they aren’t for an alpha account/one that relapsed. 
---
A second character on an omega account is treated as an omega character with a paused skill queue while a second alpha is treated as a another alpha with a paused skill queue (also why people do two separate accounts vs 1 account).
---
&gt;Skill training got too quick
---
Haha. You made me sad
---
1) If you don't know what to train take the [Magic 14](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/The_Magic_14)
---
2) Fly smalls stuff first don't go for the big ships until you know what they are used for. (And a Naglfar is a good dread)
---
3) manual piloting is usually done by double-click in space. There is a difference between flying directly at an opponent vs spiraling in, so yes its viable. 
---
4) [click](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Directional_Scanner_Guide)
---
I love it. Do you have more like this? 
---
reee a 6k fight took up 16 Gb RAM.
---
Theres a lot of comments from people that have no idea of how economics works.
---
Kinda, except you’re not as vulnerable
---
With only one client *
---
You can't possible buy that line. I can see someone doing that for a day or two but long term, it would literally kill that player. Bot or not, banning him would be doing him a favor.
---
How far away does it have to be to be off grid
---
Well you make me sad for thinking that it will get to long in the future? xD
---
1. Currently in the process of doing so :)
---
2. Just need to get a cruiser as of the moment as I want to do L2 missions. I've heard it is really hard with a frig. They also have a weird name Naglfar sounds like a hobbit.
---
3. The double click in space send me somewhere i dont want to go for reason? So i just go with the keyboards.. :P
---
4. What is a cloaked ship? is that the thing which happens when you warp? 1 min count down timer thing? or is it another skill?
---
&gt; 1.I have no clue what skills to upgrade, but skill training has gotten too quick for me to catch up.
---
Engineering, navigation, spaceship, armor and shield are always good for everyship. Generally speaking, don't bother training to lvl 5 until it's required for another ship or critical module. Lvl 5 takes time, bellow not really.
---
&gt; 2.I am a minmatar, but i have no idea why i am one (Just clicked the most idealistic one)? I fly amar executioner and coercer. Love the executioner, but the coercer not really. Can someone help me pick a faction to pursue till dreadnaughts?
---
Train and fly all faction ship. Don't bother about dreadnought. If you want one I heavily advise you either train it on another account or don't bother. It takes *months* to get into it. You can entirely enjoy the game without it.
---
&gt; Do i use the keyboard tilting to do pvp? I do survive better against pve bots because i dont drive point blank at them. Is this viable in pvp?
---
Unsure by what you mean with "tilting" but for now, orbit at your optimal range and if the enemy kite out of weapon/point range, approach him.
---
&gt; How do you use directional scanners?
---
360° 14AU to get what's next to you. Set to 5° and look at (with the C shortcut) and then scan (with the V shortcut) so that you know what at a specific location (attention, there could be several stations, stargates or celestial within that 5° angle).
---
I left the don't panic button back at the alpha clone sadly. :P
---
I am put up all the core 14s into the skill window. :) Maybe get a industrial ship for harvesting some stuff :D
---
According to who?
---
Plex will be worth what people will pay for it. If people are willing to autist level gametime for it, then that's what it will be worth.
---
No idea, probably several thousand. Nothing an afk MWDing ceptor can't do.
---
The fact that goons took all their sov and goons on reddit have repeatedly claimed that Period Basis is a new rental region would seem to be a good indication...
---
For those of you in WH corps, how does your corporation typically handle logistics, especially without a high sec connection? What is the process for bringing in raw materials, etc.? Do you primarily rely on manufacturing in the WH? 
---
i always looked at the CNI as a caracal, with basicly all the same stats but all its dps is in the missiles instead of the caracals drones, which i kind of liked anyway.
---
adding drones to the CNI although does help it on paper, having a little fitting, and either dps or application buffs would be more suited to its role 
---
upped
---
Lol this shit makes no sense
---
That was golden!
---
You must be memeing hard because all of that character’s kills are on gates in 0.9 to 1.0 space
---
I’ve flown past that char many times in his little group of blingyship PIRAT jitacampers, literally camping a gate.
---
please kill it again.  lets make first ever ship in eve-online to completly extinct 
---
Praise Bob!
---
1) Deffo train shields, half the ships in eve use them primarily. 
---
2) Nope i have 4 accounts active. When people fly caps/supers (dreads,carriers supercarriers, Titans) they will usually train them on another account. You can then have your cap logged in a fight and another ship (probably a fax). Also you need another account to use as a cyno for your cap to jump to.
---
3) The factions really dont matter tbh. 
---
for station trading you want to be in a hub like jita/rens/dodixie/amarr/hek.  those are the places people go to sell/buy for the most part.  you have to follow supply and demand.
---
[Naglfar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naglfar) is from Norse mythology.
---
If you want to get into mission running your goal will be a battleship.
---
Cloaking makes your ship invisible. There are two kinds of cloak in  the game. One has to be off for warping and can be fitted to every ship. The other can keep you permanently cloaked but requires special ships to fit.
---
i accept this to the truth that is, you simply cannot comprehend what it is i am saying. 
---
The Bowhead is an ORE industrial that specifically has a ship hold. A streamer who usually does mission running stuff (HateLess_Gaming if you want to look him up, he's nice) did a fun thing recently where he filled a Bowhead with T1 frigates, pre-fit and loaded with ammo, went to a Level4 mission, and got viewers to join him. He punted out ships and let us board them and do the mission for him. Was mega fun and mega silly, but my alt got to do a burner mission (harder than normal missions) before my main can even think about it. 
---
Effectively, you need to 'eject' from the ship you're in so you are just a capsule in space, approach the unmanned ship, and when you right click it there's a 'board ship's option (or select it and the icon comes up in place of the 'loot' button in the Current Target menu). Clicky et voila! You're in that ship. If you left a ship to board that one, that'll stay floating in space and someone else can board it by the same method, so if you're testing it, don't eject yourself from a ship you'd mind losing.
---
oh its not a single screenshot...its many many screenshots for the proof.  basically a bot will update in exact times every time.  the most blatant one was posting 2 orders at a time.  both updated exactly 5 seconds apart every single time.  you look for the patterns of behavior like that over time.
---
Holding V and clicking on something also works for a scan in that direction.
---
WTB UNIQUE BHAALGORN MODEL 
---
I'm fine with targeted ads. It's just that when they are for a 3rd party re seller that is breaking TOS. I'd much rather get some from ccp for the new skins or for plex sales. 
---
"dont like it and cant get a subscription or multiple subs at once? downgrade ur content creator account setup, become another f1 ferox drone, go alpha, leave the game"
---
like how can you not see the correlation of how many people actively playing the sandbox, how many of those are able to put in effort as a content creators for which u need multiple toons and the overall content arising from that whole thing
---
Spinning in ship while ship spins in station hangar.
---
&gt; isnt that against the EULA?
---
You can have as many accounts as you like. To have them logged in simultaneously they have to be Omega.
---
Yeah piling the useful skills is a good idea. Remember as long as you are training \*something\* then the time isn't wasted, so just keep that skill queue topped up.
---
After the core Magic 14, working towards T2 tank and T2 weapon platforms is a good idea. This is especially important with lasers, as the T2 crystals offer a very good damage boost (especially Scorch which is what really puts pulse lasers on the map).
---
Hey friend, it was still an brilliant campaign and you should be proud to have been involved. The wedge driven between Imperium and SMA, the defection and treachery by CO2, the relentless pushing for months, grinding us down. Hell you camped the entire coalition into a single lowsec station for what felt like months. Most of us were so despondent that we switched sides or stopped logging in. 
---
And there were plenty of mistakes on the part of the Imperium. Refusal to recognize that sov changes had made our territorial holdings unsustainable. Greed and paranoia on the part of the allies who refused to give up their territories and fall back on Deklein. Allowing ourselves to be divided. And the propaganda machine you guys had going was extraordinary.
---
But there's no denying that the ISK was the catalyst to overcome inertia and unite the effort, and the diplomatic grease to keep the war machine running smoothly. One of the most understated functions of the Money Badger Coalition was to ensure that members who were otherwise enemies would not attack each other's vulnerable home territories while on extended deployment up North. I imagine that would not have been apparent to the line member.
---
If I were you I'd embrace the ISK. It wasn't known to be dirty at the time, so you've got plausible deniability, and you achieved something admirable.
---
Hahahaha sick edit sir!
---
there are tools out there but i think they would be difficult to get an exact figure for as some of them only update the api's in certain time frames.  i didnt do any regional trading so it wasnt something i delved into researching so i wont try to answer a question i'm not really qualified too.
---
Typical public upset of CCP doing typical stupid shit with earnings rather than putting in back into spaceship fighting *inside of eve*.
---
anti bot tactics are always awesome :)
---
i mean, im talking to goons about goons, may aswell try telling a brick wall.
---
but hey, im putting into words how a large protion of eve feels with some of my own way of explaining it.
---
in any argument there is a milestone where its clear one person is correct, and the other is wrong, thanks for being that milestone for me :)
---
and don't worry, if you don't understand what it is i say, its not your fault you failed your own education, blame someone else, go for it.
---
&gt;1.2t is middle class these days
---
Its not even scrub 
---
thank you.  it would not be a legitimate r/eve post if i didnt offend someone somehow.
---
What exactly is the problem?
---
My goodness, those webs.
---
1. ill put them in the last of my priorities, as i guess ill be flying amar for a while. Just bought a slicer :)
---
2. I... honestly dont understand..
---
3. Yeah.. I am Minmatar but have -0.81 standing..
---
Can i have 1 omega and 1 alpha on? or no?
---
I do some PI for almost 3 year. 4bil a month with 3 character is not real. you do really less.
---
You should come back

Some of your members are starting to do weird things in wormhole, such as rolling

One thing: once you complete the tutorial agents, there'll be an option for an 'Epic Arc'. It's awesome and a great thing to do, but will be a long way away and really hard unless you can fit a destroyer type ship at least, so worth holding off on that one until you get some training done or friendlies willing to help. I waited until I was in a cruiser and it was too easy, but would have been horrific in a week-long frigate character.
---
&gt; Scorch which is wh
---
So, after 30 days or so do T2 tank and weaps? XD I guess i'll be riding the frig for along long long long time
---
Wait.. which ships allow that?
---
&gt;I... honestly dont understand..
---
Thats why you shouldnt be thinking about flying a dread yet.
---
With the exception of C4, all others can get direct high-sec wormholes rolling into them or spawning. So for larger things like fuel blocks, it's often worth waiting until you get one of these. 
---
For C5 corps, most players tend to have their own DST alts, any who don't can usually post requests on that corporations discord/slack/forum for someone to bring in stuff for a fee. 
---
This tends to be pre-built ship hulls and modules, with very little building in the hole other than fuel, capitals and bulky items like fighters. Though even then all of this can and will be hauled. Freighter capable holes are also fairly common.
---
When I first started in 2004 all I wanted was a scorpion, they looked so cool at the time.
---
to add just a bit to this...if you want to get into say, faction mods and more specifically say, dread guristas mods then you wouldnt want to go to Amarr as most people who would pick up dread guristas mods would not go Amarr.  Amarr would be better suited for orders that are oriented around True Sansha mods.  you see what i'm saying?
---
1. I am all qued up for the cores. And as you advised i am doing them in a group of 3s, and 4s.
---
2. Can I destroy stuff well in my t1 slicer well even in l2 security?
---
3. the arrow keys :)
---
4. Hmm. I guess ill have to try to understand what your saying. It would be either click C or click and C
---
Oh ty :) Ill try that out! :D
---
I guess your setup isnt as efficient
---
You are right about that. I can't think of a new revenue stream. At same time, if you farm your alts for SP and make enough isk you don't need to pay for the game. Isn't that going to reduce the income stream? 
---
Many more people plexing more accounts by farming isk, same number of people buying Plex with RL cash and selling it. Supply and demand: demand has risen, supply does not, hence it's a seller's market and they can demand higher prices. Especially given the main "12 rorq alt accounts to Plex" folk are in massive nullblocks that can still easily shell out that much and turn a profit.
---
Does killing Vytone's alt really belong in this vid, cmon dude.
---
If it's your main account, I wouldn't bother training them all to 5. Aim for covops or your T3C subsystem to 5 to get the full benefit of the 10% per level though. If it's a dedicated scanning alt you'll see the benefit in max skills. 
---
With implants and level 4 skills you can reliably get most sigs in 2 scans. Without implants you should be able to manage it in 3 if you're positioning your probes well. 
---
Sort of. I mean, it immediately allows more RAM to be used by the application so that alone could end up being a pretty huge improvement for some people. But yes, overall the client will be predominantly the same.
---
You can always pay for it, like us who are currently paying so that you can play with fake internet money instead. 
---
You don't need multiple characters to create content in eve. You don't even need omega status. 
---
3 years.  You're a newbie.
---
LOL, testies excusing this shit make it 10x worse.
---
I've been wanting to get into station trading but have been scared off by the potential complexity of it.  Thanks for the good advice!  Question: how do you pin point an item with decent margin?  Just click on items until you find one or is there a tool for this?
---
My life is a lie
---
Maybe not you but one dude made a mistake of using autopilot 
---
That's just to maximize to get the most out of your fitting.
---
If you want to fly something else or larger nothing to stop you :) This game is entirely open to you like that, just get the basic skills in and off you go (though having the skills trained up really does help!).
---
/r/iamverysmart
---
Do not I repeat do not use the arrow keys. Double clic in space to move toward that direction is all you should need along with approach / orbit and keep at range commands.
---
Regarding dscan, just youtube it you should have more visual explanation.
---
Nope - you can have as many Omega accounts running as you like, but if you're logged-into 1 alpha account, NO other accounts can be logged-in. 
---
Yeah.. Ill just stick to my new slicer :D
---
Can you do the same with a DST? Ive heard of people living out of one before, but never seen it myself
---
I would seriously be really surprised if Provi were to third party something in that type of scenario for several reasons:
---
1. Risk aversion. Some coalition members will get the idea that it is a strategic sacrifice but many won't which means you will have difficulties getting the numbers needed to affect the outcome.
---
2. Even if Provi could get the numbers together, the typical line members don't have the skill diversity needed to fly multiple doctrines and the really good doctrines are skill intensive.
---
3. These boil down to the real problem: Leadership. There are really only 5 alliances which generally support the coalition: Apoc, -7-, COGG, CF, and CVA. The rest are doing their own thing. There is no attempt to ensure people are getting in to doctrine ships. If you fly through Provi space during an OP you will find people ratting, mining, etc. Ask them if they know about the OP and many will say "what op?". Information is not being disseminated mainly because the leadership is afraid of spies which is a fair concern as there are plenty of corps who don't vet new recruits properly.
---
I would love to see Provi go and mess somebody's day up like you suggest but I don't think it will happen. Provi has just too many significant road blocks they need to get figured out before they are really going to be able to participate in any meaningful way. It might even require a change in leadership to effectively start the rebuilding process. 
---
I am subbing 5accs. That's not even the point but I see u don't understand. It's fine 
---
The only reason to not use higher grade implants is if you're scared to lose them.
---
If you won't be at risk of dying and losing your pod, then the very easy answer is, "Yes, +5s are better".
---
On a more technical level, it represents an on-attributes training speed increase of 1.5 skillpoints per minute from +4s, which works out to roughly  388,800 extra SP. It's not a massive amount, but if you're talking about min-maxing, then its 388k more than +4s so there it is. 
---
Exacctly, it s because of the money ccp made on skill extractor that Eve online is still here. 
---
What they can do : they can double the price of the skill extractor. So they will be lesss skill farm or people will use it less-&gt; more plex will be used for real playerbase and not alt.
---
That's fine, we can agree to disagree.
---
+5s are worth if you have cyber 5 already, for sure. Extra 650k sp or so over the 6 months
---
Evemon lets you sort by primary attribute, so you can do that to move your order around for your remaps 
---
They are, but they are still paying CCP money each month. Half the income for CCP is going to be a huge problem for them
---
Nice. Between you an Maxine I had a good time flying with them and seeing them used solo. 
---
F
---
This is one of the main st entertaining videos I've seen in a while. Nice work amigo
---
The disease is that alliances eating all smaller alliances. 
---
&gt;Your cargo will go towards buying more Talos to gank the next freighter, everyone will know your pain!
---
Solidary murder!
---
Oh I forgot I don't have Cyber 5 lol. Well never mind then...
---
+5s and remap and train a bunch of things. When I left for 7 months on deployment I trained nothing but spaceship command skills. Also doing this you only need to buy 2 implants compared to the full set. As far as putting your isk into plex vault, you may be better just keeping your isk as plex is currently super high and are likely to lose isk rather than gain it.
---
Stupid question:
---
Is Eve fun for a Solo player? I don't have a circle of friends that like this sort of game, they are more looter shooter types. 
---
I have played Eve on and off over the past few years, but always arrive at the same conclusion, that I am grinding in life to make money to exist, and feel like I always end up doing the same in Eve.
---
I do play with others in terms of corp, trade etc, but that is about as far it goes.
---
In 2019 has anything much changed?
---
&gt;So, after 30 days or so do T2 tank and weaps? XD I guess i'll be riding the frig for along long long long time
---
The Magic-14 are skills that are USEFUL for all pilots/ships, but you shouldn't feel obligated to train all of them to V before anything else.   
---
Getting up to level 3 or 4 in most of the early skills is a fairly quick train, and allows you to do stuff 'good-enough'.  If you're new, try some different stuff. Losing a Tech 1 destroyer isn't a big deal, so long as you're having fun. 
---
The question for you is what sorta stuff sounds interesting to you?  You'll want to find a good way to make some ISK that isn't soul-crushing for you. 
---
I believe grid size is around 8k these days.
---
This is like arguing bitcoin is a scam/ponzi-scheme/stupid isn't it.  It's true but you'll be turfed by lots of detractors and when you check them out it turns out they are themselves heavily invested in ... bitcoin.  To nobody's surprise.
---
Also you said "toon", which gives you away.
---
Damn good kill, gratz testies.
---
With the 64 bit client coming, you stand a better chance of not needing potato mode :D
---
basically i ruled out anything that was mainstream.  that cut a lot of searching time out.  i went through market items and the first thing i would look for is what the buy order amount was compared to the sell order amount.  the very lowest margin i would take would be 20%.  you want to make a decent margin but you also have to figure in the cost of setting up the market buy and the fees/taxes to sell.  if the margin was good i would look at price history.  if the "normal" pricing was good then i would put in a buy.  by "normal" i mean, sometimes things get out of whack with items.  there was an item trading that i picked up at 34m.  at the time i put in the buy order the lowest sell was at nearly 200m.  the price history showed the "normal" rate over a 6 month period was around 65 mill.  this told me that even at the 34m buy price i was still relatively safe if/when there was a market correction, which did happen, but not before i made a handsome profit on it.  now if the buy orders had spiked like the sell orders and say gone to 90m i would have overlooked that item because the risk of loss would have been higher.  sometimes risks pays off...but then sometimes it involves a trip to hospital if you get what im sayin.
---
&gt;I'm wondering if there's a way to re-arrange the skills and re-map so cut down on time.
---
Try sorting by primary attribute. Since you might only have one remap over that 6-month period try a few different points based on the primary and secondary attributes to see where it works. The optimizer will tell you the best remap for your plan as opposed to the best plan for your remap. Make sure you manually add remapping points. I don’t think eve mom actually puts any on automatically.
---
'He's a noob in a t1 shitfit, hold him for 5 while we go get the AT's, god we're elite risking so much' 
---
At a minimum it could just make the head of your avatar swell enourmously to mark the character as a dirty dirty ‘jector.
---
Remember kids: Injectors, not even once.
---
4 bil a month is just a lie ;)
---
This is true, I had a gate that I was camping that one side of the gate, at like 120km off the gate I was no longer on grid. This was post grid changes. 
---
&gt; As far as putting your isk into plex vault, you may be better just keeping your isk as plex is currently super high and are likely to lose isk rather than gain it.
---
This is dangerous. I have a feeling we did not yet hit the ceiling and i would suppose 500plex can get as high as 3bn this year, maybe more.
---
explain?
---
1) Look up the golden 14(I think they're 14 anyway). They're a bunch of general fitting skills you'll need to get to at least lvl 4 for any high end fit and will eventually have to get them to 5. You can open a lot of options later on by training them early. HOWEVER, training skills relevant to whatever you want to do at the time also helps early on to provide some variety, so it's more difficult to get bored. Look up what's useful for what you want to do, and train it.
---
2) Most factions have options for high speed kiters, each with a different place in the meta and different skill requirements. Generally you won't go bigger than cruisers for this play style. Some strong options are the orthrus, cynabal, osprey navy issue, zealot, omen navy issue, and the list goes on. By the time you fly dreads a) you will have more than 1 account, and b) at least 1 of your characters will be flyins most subcaps.
---
3) Not really. Most people, myself included, will say that keyboard piloting is suboptimal for PvP. Yes, technically you have more control over your movement if you know what you're doing, but you can no longer see the grid since you'll be in 1st person. Try practicing manual flight with double clicking in space, it's a lot less restrictive.
---
4) Dscan scans at a selectable angle from where the center of your camera is facing. Most of the time you'll be scanning full 360 at max range, and if you want to find something(or someone) you mainly adjust the range and check what celestial/anom they could be at. If you want to scan towards a specific celestial, like a gate, set the angle and range and then hold dscan shortcut and click. The camera will turn towards the object and then you'll get your scan. Look up guides for more details and practice a lot, you'll need to get fast with dscan.
---
Look for covert ops cloaking device on the market and look it up in the item info window. Covert ops and recon ships can have it. Some examples: falcon, stratios, astero, buzzard
---
Theres alot of could. Only time will tell. If it was still 1.5 I'd say go for it. Just a little too volatile that I would risk it. Who knows how long he will be gone and how many plex sales will occur and how many bots will get banned in that time. 
---
that was some impressive editing, nice work
---
footage/piloting was a little less interesting, but it was a great 5m video
---
The heavy ECM drones from the stratios were what really got me on this one. 
---
Krabbing is the act of grinding base materials or isk out of nothing. This can be ratting anoms or belts, incursions, mining, etc. 
---
We should make your posting completely extinct.
---
I do believe that the GOTG NIP has ended, or will end very soon.
---
Covert Ops Frigates, Stealth bombers (high DPS missile/bombing frigates), Recon ships, Strategic Cruisers with the covert subsystem equipped. Also the Astero and Stratios faction ships.
---
Sure i have, everybody reads those. Repeatedly!
---
lol
---
Poland. :DDDD Not surprised, not surprised at all, dear Watson. 
---
your brain cells have already extincted
---
I don't understand what the importance of this post is, was or is this battle of strategic importance to the proposed up and comming war between Legacy and Winter Co or is it just another proud moment for a group?
---
Exactly. The risk is high anyway. I am glad i am space poor right now, so it does not matter to me presonally, my head would ache from this decision. 
---
Not realistic enough. Theres not a nyx in the background about to insta-pop it with fighters.
---
Jokes aside, great artwork!
---
Sick
---
lmao imagine thinking Maxine was actually solo
---
I think they should open up things a bit let you design your skins and mod the gui, it works for world of tanks and they bring in something like a real life 3.5 million dollars a month in that game.
---
"Skill training got too quick and i am lost in the game."
---
You are playing this game in wrong way lol
---
&gt;EvE is a very demanding game, to the point of requiring constant play time in order to enjoy the game...
---
Yes and no. Eve absolutely will let you sink your life into it just to get that extra edge and few more millimeters linger space-penis. But on the other hand, the minimum threshold to just go out there and jack around having fun is really low. The hardest part about it may often be just getting you and your stuff where you want to be. 
---
&gt;I currently don’t have a lot of time to play (more or less 5-6 hours each week)
---
In this case, make sure you either find something you really enjoy, or find a relatively stable group that has the content pace that’s good for you. The group you play with is going to be a big part of what you do so don’t feel too invested too quickly. Be ready to try a few out of necessary. I’m a little dated on my newbie-group info but some names to look up are Pandemic Horde, Brave Newbies, Red vs Blue (if they’re still around?), Eve University, Karmafleet (part of goonswarm) and many others I am sure I forgot. This subreddit wiki/info page has more details.
---
&gt;Should I pick up the game and eventually pay a subscription?
---
If this stuff sounds interesting, go for it. It’s free. It will be a bit overwhelming at first, but just remember, you don’t need to actually be good at the game to have fun. Even if you subscribe only for a little bit, you can keep access to a lot of the stuff you trained while you were an omega (there’s a list somewhere I don’t have it). So there’s no real loss beyond 15$. Geuss the advice is just to take baby sprints or something. 
---
Just keep in mind, do not fall for the “but I have to” traps. If you find yourself running missions day after day or mining till your eyes bleed (unless you find those two fun vOv) you’re falling for the trap. If you’re arms go numb, face tingly, palms sweaty, you know you’re going the right way.

Oh.. thats a interesting feature..

Hopefully the 64bit client will finally fix fighters against subcaps

Hm.. I just fully fitted a slicer, and went on a mission. too bad i dont have the scortch S but, i am still loving it :)
---
I was hoping to do PVP to learn the game. But, there are just so many things to get used to first. 
---
My current objective is to get 2nd level weapons to make me have an easier time in pve missions :)
---
thank you :)
---
Yeah I debated even making a video because frankly the flying isn’t nothing to write home about.  The ship is so OP everything just dies most of the before you even can do anything. I decided to put it out there since there want any footage of the GM flying and probably never will be again. 
---
Oh wow.. but you cant attack while cloaked (most possibly). You do get the element of surprise i guess?
---
:( No more WASD :( 
---
Im pretty sure there is no wrong way (there just throw you out in dirt space).
---
But, i sure that i am playing most inefficiently :P
---
&gt;Is Eve fun for a Solo player?
---
For some, yes, but such people are extremely rare in my experience
---
&gt;I do play with others in terms of corp, trade etc, but that is about as far it goes.
---
Find a corp that does fun stuff together, for example: almost any corp
---
&gt;In 2019 has anything much changed?
---
Can you be more specific, what kind of changes are you asking about?
---
Okay.

Man's gotta drip, feel me?

What you have now is about 20-30 seconds of tank against a rapid lights cruiser. I know because:

This idea is actually something this subreddit heavily hates, or loves, or hates, or loves. It depends day by day and week by week. It also depends on if there are mass skill farmers browsing reddit at that moment in time to dismiss the idea by downvoting. 
---
Monday is Karaoke night on my ship.

Bulgarian or Serbian. Names used are also closer to old Slavic names, which more often than not are better preserved in those languages.
---
What if walking in spaceship was instanced? Let's be realistic here, maybe limit this to offering a cockpit view each hull size - no other special variations or interaction with other players. Something similar to what docking looks like. Then, at the very least, you could spin in your captain's chair while talking shit in local while gazing at your 300m dripped boots.
---
1. Just bought a Slicer, and decided I will push the magic 14s a bit back to enjoy the fun! really loving this slicer that i bought a skin for it :)
---
2. Dread are like my loooong time goal, while titans are my looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong time goals :) I just want to work on the right ship I want to play. :) Thank you for the tips n the high speed kiters :) 
---
3. Hmm. I should look up a video or something like that :)
---
4. I will do that :) I wanted to PVP so badly. But not knowing the basics just hesitates me. I have a UI figured out, and now the D-scan. Might as well hop on low-sec and see the creative ways i can booom. &lt;On my executioner... Not my slicer :D&gt;
---
ship skins i can understand, but clothing?!

Less people in space makes Eve a boring game. I support CCP's decision tbh. And for those folks that don't undock and play the market, manufacture, etc --  you make a real impact, too. But without folks in space doing their thing, your markets will tank.
---
I'd believe that if we hadn't been able to do it before. 
---
1b into 16 isk? Nice! 
---
"Before" the client was shut down and restarted to the login-password screen. I.e. the same as now with tiny bit more automation.
---
Pretty much for all of US. 
---
So you don't have any significant source of income nor any prospects beyond going back to school to finish education. You note thousands of dollars you spent on eve, yet reportedly had no notion to recoup that, you also pretend like you don't know what "overhead" is or what the most logical/reasonable retort to anything you'd write would be (don't go back to college, lay bricks instead trust me)
---
The community typically sides with CCP on their punitive measures (not like it matters what reddit thinks). You should stop writing tickets tying up resources and support for the game and let the cards fall where they may. 
---
Nobody here really knows what you are guilty of, nor does anybody really care. Best advice would be to wait for a different result or come clean. For all you know Azathio sold you down the river and pinned everything on you in an attempt not to sink. If you were buying his isk instead of selling it, you might want to tell CCP this if you can isolate it to less than 3 exchanges. 
---
Either way, due to the nature of sharing isk, that money is gone forever no matter the outcome as it's dirty, ask those involved with IWI who were innocent. 
---
27B in defaulted loans is exactly how you RMT through loaning. That doesn't help your case, but funny if you lost your account for selling $100 in isk or buying $300 in isk from aza.
---
Working on it in my spare time, have to watch this space
---
the editing and uniqueness of the video alone makes it worth it, don't doubt your decisions
---
good shit
---
I'm terms of investing the ISK
---
 if you are looking to make a bunch of money, plex or skill injectors may be best. At it's price now i would see if you can wait it out for a plex sale from ccp. Log back on a week or two later and buy on a possible low. It would not require much time. I just don't see the current price holding when the last serious plex sale was a while ago.
---
If you just want to guard against inflation maybe but some expensive deadspace mods like A-type invulns. Price should hold close to inflation and i do not recall then losing value in the past. 
---

I mean, he *is* a goon. They do have a habit of being like "I don't give a shit and here's a novel on all the ways I don't give a shit."
---
no point???
---
This is why I'm glad I have the background they discontinued (the black and yellow one) so I can't burn any more isk on stupid space barbie shit. Nothing is better than something other people can't get.
---
No one really cares at the end of the day. Eve died.
---
Wow really cool StainGuy, thank you.
---
&gt;You can probably also kill some NC supers or titans in the process.
---
Sure, let me just move 400 dreads nearby........
---
&gt;i am still loving it :)
---
Then you're doin' it right!
---
&gt; But, there are just so many things to get used to first. 
---
You are not wrong about that!
---
One thing to remember is there's a pretty big amount of 'diminishing returns' as you go from Tech 1 to Faction to Tech 2 ships/modules.   
---
Faction stuff (like the  **Imperial Navy Slicer** ) is \~10% better than the Tech 1 equivalent, and maybe 5 times the price.
---
Tech 2 stuff is \~20% better and around 10 times the price, not to mention it usually need a significant investment in skills (often a V-level in something) meaning 10 times the skill-training to get it.
---
In other words, if you really dig frigate combat, great - train-up on Tech 2 guns.  But don't be afraid to mix-in some other stuff. A little bit of investment gets you a long way.   
---
Here's a core-mechanic that really helps understand how some fights work:   
---
Turrets, tracking, and transversal:

[https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Turrets](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Turrets)

It's a longish read, and there's lots of charts and numbers, but if you get the basic concept, it'll illuminate a lot of what's going on behind the scenes. 
---
But there is sounding: one of the capsule interfaces is urethral.

You do it 
---
The possibility of fighting the rarest ship in the game is all the tackle he needs.
---
Wow! This is amazing work!

Didn't test just try that?

&gt;Potential way to make a lot of isk! Here how....

Here in my Hangar... just follow these proven steps! ... ISKs are Fuel Units.

---
wow super cool information thanks for posting it brother
---
Correct but there are 3 things in eve that fund CCP as a company. 1. Subs 2. Plex 3. Microtransactions
---
When players use in game plex to purchase game time they are not directly funding CCP as the game time was already purchased. It's not new money coming into the company to pay people real world paychecks. More people people having access to more and more isk without new players coming in and staying hurts them financially. Ultimately if people in eve want to continue to play they gotta realize this.
---
No, there’s only one post in there. Did you link the right subreddit?
---
mother of all patch notes by the way
---
Not very much more than i make right now. If i could move my VNI from a -0.1 system to a -0.6 system it would probably cover everything that i am working on right now. But people hunt VNIs in those systems and losing them tanks my income which is the current thing i'm trying to work out.

I've been flying a hecate and a malediction around for standing fleet trying to get into skirmishes to learn more. Unfortunately it seems that the kind of people who come in small groups to GE- can sense the fact that i have very little experience and i always get primaried.

as a dirty c4 dweller, I'll take a stab.

We live with a c3 static, so finding the kspace connection that we want is usually just a matter of rolling the static. We use this to bring and stock doctrine ships that people just buy off contract.  We are limited to dsts for shipping, but with the amount of pilots we have shipping has never been a problem.
---
We do some manufacturing in the home hole, but most of our time is spent pewing, not a lot of time left for mining. We usually just bring in what we need.

killing Vytone's alt belongs in every video my dude

Because you like killing PVE ships and noobs for easy isk.

Out of Focus lives in a C2-NS/C5 as mentioned. Our C5 chain is super handy for content and logistics. Don't like the current connections? Roll it! That's the joy of wormhole living.

Ok yeah but that doesn’t mean that plex prices are insane, it just means that fucking rorquals have been strong for too long and is the reason why plex prices are insane (well one of)

Most people don't play 7 days a week every week. 3-4 days a week is probably the average which would be 125m - 167m isk per day to PLEX account at current prices.

seconding this. I live in a c4. Sites are garbage. Stick with c3
---
On an alliance StratOp, I had to take a dump mid-battle. Figured I’d be in a pod at best when I returned.  The Logi kept me alive ... I was called the “poop guy” for a few weeks until someone else f’d up. 😂
---
Roll the static until you get one with HS connection, then roll the static of your static to get somewhere close to hub, bring whatever you need in. You don't have to do it every day, so it's not a big deal to do once in a (couple of) week(s).
---
Also, I have not really mined in WH, but I have seen people farming with Rorquals all across J-Space. But if you need to bring something in you could use Endurance - 15k m3 ore hold can take a lot of compressed ore in. Two of these can move ore valued over the billion easily. Travel fit Porpoise is also pretty fast and can get you 50k m3,  if your trip is through relatively safe systems you could use it as well.

---
&gt;Side note: the Daredevil was actually designed for Serpentis by the Angel Cartel (Serpentis &amp; Angels are super best friends in the lore, Guardian Angels have a few NPC stations in Fountain and everything.) That's why Daredevil is the only Serpentis ship that has a unique design and doesn't start with V.
---
It's the other way around. It was designed by Guardian Angel engineers to work alongside their dramiel.
---
&gt;Little hard data is to be had on the Daredevil's exact origin, but it is believed that Guardian Angel engineers created it to serve as a defensive complement to the Cartel's Dramiel frigate. In both flair and utility it closely resembles its counterpart, but it eschews offensive capabilities in favor of greater defensive potential and stronger armor plating. A tough nut to crack.
---
Yeap those just fuel RMT.

OP is just buttmad about PLEX prices, which is the theme for this week on e/EVE I guess.

We must gate camp in Lowsec too. Did you know I’m an elite Lowsec pvp dude?

https://zkillboard.com/kill/75761242/

Stealth bombers do. But regular covert ops ships have a 5s targeting delay after the decloak. So someone can see you or 5s before you can start locking them up. And ships like the Astero and Stratios have to wait 10s.
---
I dono I dont think they are too happy with us right now. Something about not getting a guaranteed kipstar kill?

just past the upvulture 
---
This is a true neutral comment without any blue donuts.
---
Its not bots driving up the price via more ISK in the market that wasnt really "earned" or grinded out?
---
From what i've heard pvp can be made a lot easier by having someone watching your back. 
---
Lose a rorq and let me know how much you lose. Pretty sure it's going to be more then 3b.
---
Can concur. Make around 5 bil a month station flipping on one alt. 
---
So cargo drones. From factorio.
---
&gt;As you said, it's supposed to kill smaller ships, which is why it's a great RLML platform.  When comparing the ship as a purely RLML platform you will see that it performs just as well as other ships of it's type, and moreover, is a straight buff of the bog standard Caracal 
---
When actually its not a straight buff with RLML. T1 Caracal gets a range bonus to RLML, the Naracal does not. T1 Caracal is better at shooting down frigs since its harder for them to outrun your missiles (not to say you can't kill frigs with a RLML CNI, but there are better ships for that). The T1 Caracal, Cerb, Nosprey get all their bonuses applied to RLML. CNI does not. Using RLML is a waste on the CNI hull tbh. Its a HML/HAM ship. If you want an RLML spammer ship, there are plenty of those already in the game, the CNI is a HAM/HML ship with the application bonus and does nothing unique with RLML that any other RLML ship can't do.
---
&gt; HAMs and Heavies, even with the bonus (as you yourself pointed out) just don't do the job. 
---
I didn't say they "don't do the job". I said the slot layout prevents the ship from properly utilizing the bonus combined with its lack of fitting to actually support HAMS/HML. I've used the CNI numerous times and it [works well](https://zkillboard.com/kill/61052029/) when you fit for it, but it really limits the ship.
---
&gt; What makes it not worth flying is the price. at 14x the price of a standard Caracal it isn't worth undocking when other Navy ships do the same job for cheaper (an SFI being less than half the price).  So a good balance (not fix) would be to reduce the LP cost of CNIs 
---
Its price is due to it being such an unattractive turd due to the issues i've pointed out. There is no movement in the market, so the people who have invested in them have limited inventory and as such, they sell at a higher price. It also is dependent on which way the FW hammer swings to see where farmers go. If no one is farming caldari LP, caldari ships will be more expensive. There is a ton of Minmatar LP out there, plus ScyFI's are actually a decent ship and have market movement. Adjusting LP would have little effect on their price if only 3 people still continue to buy CNI's.
---
Station trading is a case of the rich get richer. I dropped about 2b on my market/hauler alt and started in a lower volume area. I made about 1b isk in profit flipping some high margin meta 4/T2 modules always buying and reselling locally but it was slow. I also dabbled in faction stuff.   
---
At one point I was jumping from hub to hub, setting up buy orders for the modules I was selling in other hubs and either hauling them or couriering them. Someone got wise and tanked a couple of my high margin items and I decided to focus on the big money makers in a couple main hubs but I would put up an order and be undercut by 5 0.01 isk offers in 5 seconds.   
---
Sold my stock, packed that shit up. Unless you have huge piles of isk just floating around and the time to sit on big buy/sell orders, pretty much anything else makes better money.
---
“Treachery of Co2” ... interesting you still cling to that old chestnut.

If Goon leadership hadn’t treated them like vassals and meat-shields, they probably would never have left.

You do know if you buy 500 Plex with money, it's still just $20 and hasn't increased right? Right?
---
another panfam hate boner thread lol
---
Injectors wasnt the downfall of panfam, stain guy posting was.

The reason is probably more technical than story. Having too many ship models will eat though the video memory of the lower end pcs that they are targeting.
---
Tikle my dino
---
&gt; How??? You can just scoop unpowered cits?
---
They take a full week to unanchor. If you see one unanchoring and return from time to time, you might be able to scoop it before the owner. Extra points if you do it right in front of them. The cit doesn't cause aggro, so there's no suspect flag.
---
It's work, though and I only do it for shits and tears when I'm really bored. I have better luck putting up buys in regions that are not The forge for a low price and relisting in Jita. Takes a while for the really undercut buy orders to fill, though.
---
Debatable
---
The tax that goes to alliance from membercorps.
---
Most membercorps run anything from 5-15% tax.
---
&gt; It's just that when they are for a 3rd party re seller that is breaking TOS
---
But it says right there that it's legal! ;)
---
Unpopular opinion! 
---
Both a Stiletto and Ares are the best for this now assuming you have perfect skills and depending on your objective (speed, scanning, hacking, or combat)
---
This is actually a giant misconception! Going from 32-bit to 64-bit isn’t actually a linear increase. A 32-bit data set caps out at 2^32 and because each character slot takes up about 1.4 billion data points we’re currently limited to 3 accounts. 
---
However, once we upgrade to the 64-bit client we’ll have 2^64 data points available. Which means we’ll be able to fit 12.8 MILLION! Characters per account. 
---
This change will completely shift the skill farm meta 
---
Not even great for EU, a large chunk of us won't even be home from work when this finishes.
---
I just dropped 2.4 bil on a rare skin for a ship I don't even fly on a regular basis (this is probably nothing to some of you, but I had maybe 6 bil in cash between my chars). But it's gorgeous and I'd been checking Jita every day for months waiting for one to come up for sale. And now it's mine and unlike fancy ships, mods and implants, nobody can ever blow it up!
---
There was only ever one of them, right? And it was destroyed many years ago? Where'd the footage from and what was OP about the ship? What was its role, etc?
---
I was talwar fc, why u run

C'mon man, Stainguy just guaranteed super and titan kills.

To point two; most people will have multiple accounts to be their own support crew.  You'll have a healer, and a scout, an account to help it move, etc.
---
Uhuh
---
&gt; Pretty sure it's going to be more then 3b.
---
and you'd be wrong.  but hey, maybe it just isn't your day.  
---
Most fits minus the drones come in between 3-4B.  Insurance is 1B.  so your loss should be between 2-3B. 
---
Well that's just perfectly reasonable.
---
Started to learn how to mine in a fleet on Sunday. Went afk for 90s and kept my drones in the bay because I had previously disconnected from them when I went on a station run and my fleet said I'd be fine to be afk. Left. Came back. VENTURE DESTROYED. Shame. Learning to save internet fittings and multibuy.
---
You must be new here
---
It isn't a bad patch. Its fair to say "The mother of all capital rebalance patches" as it hit on a lot of sticking points for capitals. Its subcap rebalances were somewhat random. The Ferox/Harb/Beam buffs make sense, the Abaddon, CNI and Cyclone buffs seem very random or missing the issues with the ship hulls.
---
Fucking pvp'ers, get out of my region REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
It also had a really awful engine that made sitting in a single room on a couch looking at a screen in potato mode run worse than Far Cry on max settings. I shudder to think what would have happened had it needed to render other players' avatars. But if it worked, I'd want it back.
---
Someone has to pay real money to CCP to sell you that PLEX, so you're indirectly introducing money into the game. That's aside from the cost of extractors, which also cost PLEX and are thus purchased with RL money.
---
I hate the injection market as much as you but CCP would literally be cutting its wrists by just straight up removing them from the game.
---
I have made a suggestion regarding how to keep RL money rolling in in a way that kills injector farms but still allows significantly speeding up training without allowing instant rorq pilots.
---
I doubt they'll do it, though and TBH I haven't spent much time thinking through the idea long enough to identify drawbacks because ::effort::

There were 4 originally, 2 have been lost according to zkill
---
There's no question that CO2 were treacherous. They announced their departure only after coordinating with enemies to trap our supercap fleet in a move op (unsuccessfully), and then leaked the locations of all our supercaps in build. The victimhood story was a fabrication to cover internal corruption (embezzlement by their moon mining POS manager) that had sapped their finances and caused them to feel like unequal partners. Later logs revealed that leader GigX had harbored a grudge all along and had been planning to turn coat for months.
---
But you do a good job of demonstrating how the propaganda worked.
---
That doesn't correct the other issues injectors have introduced (like insta rorq pilots) and TBH, I expect when you double the extractor price, the market will adjust the related costs upward which will cause more of these threads to happen as PLEX prices hit 8M a piece.
---
I think that there is a Raven that is completely gone. Some of the older limited edition ships are totally gone.

I will pay 6,000 PLEX for an interactable pet fedo.

&gt; Why schedule it for a Wednesday? :(
---
I never understood why they don't schedule these for multiple runs during overlapping TZ times on a weekend. Maybe it's some labor law thing they have to abide by but it cuts the numbers pretty hard.

You guys, I just looked it up, and 64 bit can theoretically run 16.8 million terabytes of RAM. That *might* be enough for WiS to run smoothly! We're getting closer!

No such resource exists. Every ship can be fit in so many different ways and still be considered viable, even for the same task. You have to take your goal, your SP, your skills as a player, your funds, and everything in between in to consideration when fitting your ship.
---
Best advice is to search zkillboard.com for the ship you would like to fit. Then look for one that seems to resemble the same goal you have in mind for your ship, and adjust from there. Learning to fit a ship on your own is a very large part of this game, but it takes time and ship losses to properly develop the skill.
---
ye but is there away to focus down the ships to find which am fitted right for pve/pvp combat ?

Scanning makes me wanna kms but ty. If I ever get bored of null I'll consider wh for sure

Times have changed. The solo walking in stations was a major feature and a huge disappointment as it was only your room.  I would like to walk in a station while seeing other players avatars though. It's a big piece of immersion for me. There's also something to be said for interacting with someone by physically walking up to them and showing them that I am indeed a pretty pretty lady.
---
Ship powercreep, improved farming methods, relative peace, farms and fields, rorquals, supers, speculations, etc. have all led to increased earning potential and overall wealth.
---
SP farming and higher quality SKINs probably use up a lot of PLEX too.
---
Then there's the falling player base, and likely PLEX buyers too, reducing the supply of PLEX.

Did the orders end in 420.69?

Learning how to fit your ship is one of the most rewarding things you can do in the game. The "meta" in this game changes all the time so a good fit can become a bad fit with a simple patch/update.

It seems like others are hitting your questions. I know you didn't ask, but you should look into joining a corporation. Or at least a discord community that can answer longer/more numerous questions you will eventually have.
---
There's so much to learn in this game and sometimes you just need to be on voice comms and ask 200 questions. Maybe once you play around doing missions for a week, check out /r/evejobs.  There are 4 or 5 major alliances with newbie corps that are great places to wet your feet, but you can explore those for yourself.

if you really wanted to do it, i guess you could put some isk into plex. it could go up more &amp; that way you wouldn’t risk all of your isk. even if it drops in value, it probably won’t be a huge drop so you’ll still have a good part of it. 
---
I wouldn't say it's changed in 2019 compared to 2018. Abyssal sites were added as instanced PvE (not a 2019 change, but still recent). Where were you mining before? If you're talking about highsec, that has always been boring and there were always better, more profitable alternatives. For example: literally anything else.

You talk like every ship has one fitting. So you want a loki fit? Ok, what kind? Hunter, scanner, shield, armor, active, buffer, PVE, PVP, tackle, HAMs, artys, logi or long range webs? It's not about having a fit for every ship, it about having the right fit for what you're doing. Good luck on your search.

"People have been shocked by the price range in the NeX store, but you should remember that we are talking about clothes.
---
Look at the clothes you are currently wearing in real life. Do you have any specific brands? Did you choose it because it was better quality than a no-name brand?
---
Assume for a short while that you are wearing a pair of $1,000 jeans from some exclusive Japanese boutique shop. Why would you want to wear a pair of $1,000 jeans when you can get perfectly similar jeans for under $50? What do other people think about you when they see you wearing them?
---
For some you will look like the sad culmination of vainness while others will admire you and think you are the coolest thing since sliced bread. Whichever it is, it is clear that by wearing clothes you are expressing yourself and that the price is one of the many dimensions that clothes possess to do that in addition to style and fit.
---
You don't need to buy expensive clothes. In fact you don't need to buy any clothes. Whatever you choose to do reflects what you are and what you want others to think you are."

Not a whole lot there really compared to previous summit minutes. CSM just telling CCP about a lot of balance stuff thats already widely agreed upon. New monetisation director, sounds like they're going in a different direction with skin sales. UI mini team so thats cool I guess.

i absolutely agree that what i done here was not what i would consider a good isk income.  I make much better isk/hr on other ventures with other alts.  since i can play at work in limited capacity i looked for something that would mesh with that.  mining is to clicky and i dont have time to watch for gankers.  anything to do with null/wh/low sec is out of the question since i cant have eyes all the time.  this seemed to work with what i can do and hey...855 mill profit on a 200 mill investment for 30 days is not really that bad, especially if you are a newer player looking to get into trading.  it would be enough capital to either launch another project with better isk income or invest more heavily into the market and try to scale profits.  it was interesting for me to see something new in the game and have the ability to share that experience with someone else that may have an interest in it. :)

" Fozzie asks how they feel about the nuclear option of just banning HAWs on Titans. CSM members nodded their heads and just said yes. "

Got tackled by while flying a Phantasm by a small gang of 6... I managed to kill one (stiletto).
---
I could not hit them as I was PvE fit, of course,,, I died about 15 minutes later with all of them doing what they could.
---
The interesting part... one of the pilots apologized in Local for how long it was taking them!  LOL!
---
I learned a lesson regardless and they were cool, at least!
---
No, I just always have dscan open and I'm constantly refreshing it while I'm out roaming or exploring, looking for anything interesting, such as expensive drones, t2 fighters, POS towers with hangars but without force fields, abandoned ships, or citadels that have no name: instead of System - name the unanchored ones are just called 'Astrahus' or 'Athanor' etc. The hardest part usually is finding a safe route for a Blockade Runner to get the stuff out.
---
Here are some ways to find a good ship fit:
---
1. Join a Corp and ask for fitting advice.
---
2. Look on zkillboard. Search by ship type and filter by losses only. This at least will tell you what is popular.
---
3. Download a third party fitting tool.  I use evedroid on my phone because it's convenient.  I used EFT for a long time but that's dead now.  PYFA is what you want on your desktop.  Try different things out, look at the stats you get, and try to think about how that will affect combat.
---
4. Look at PvP videos people post.  They often include fits.
---
Nidhoggur for some reason is just so goddamn aesthetic for me.
---
Widow, I love cloaky shit, and the scorpion hull is one of my favorites.

Un-released dream ship? T2/faction/pirate Rokh
---
Lots of demand, and we no longer are getting massive sales every other month to keep the price down.
---
Because of the inherent nature of this sub, if I like a post, I won't just upvote, I'll actually let the person know.  This sub can be so quick to beat people down.
---
Taking the initiative in badly edited videos
---
that is awesome.  i've always heard about station flipping but never had the drive to put the research into it.  i had done some alliance market seeding back in the day so i was familiar with market practice but then i also basically had a shopping list laid out in front of me in the form of doctrines.  i was surprised how quickly some buy orders filled as i've never really worked with those before.
---
Welcome to the GSM, representing everyone, but only if youre in goons. 
---
I'm going to have to respectfully disagree with the assertion that the CNI is a HAM Heavy boat. The traits are misplaced in my opinion. If you give the CNI same 2nd trait as the Caracal it becomes a direct upgrade. If you extend the explosion radius trait to include light missiles then it's still a direct upgrade substituting application for range.
---
[I'll use this fit as the standard](https://i.imgur.com/ylHJlX6.png), the Caracal has the exact same mods minus 1 launcher.
---
The CNI has more base shield, armor, and hull hp. Giving it an additional 9.6k ehp.
---
The CNI has better base speed and agility.
---
The CNI has 250 more base GJ than the Caracal (about 2 small cap batteries, or half of a medium).
---
The CNI has more missile DPS because of it's extra launcher. The addition of 25mbits brings the paper dps of both back in line.
---
All other aspects, barring the traits &amp; fitting, of the CNI and Caracal are the same.
---
After all this what I'm trying to get across is that it does everything a Caracal does, just a bit better. And a Caracal is best at RLML against things like frigs/dessies. So the CNI is just a better Caracal when doing Caracal things. The drone bay addition further adds to this point because the paper DPS of the two Caracal drones skewed damage in favor of (equal to) the Caracal.
---
The cost is only a factor of demand. Nobody's buying them so nobody's selling them. This is artificially inflating the price. I suppose we can either fix the ship which would fix the demand, or adjust the price (45k LP down to 35 or 40K) to incentivize its usage. Fixing the ship would probably fix the price.
---
The 2nd trait only exasperates a problem that exists at the beginning, which is people trying to use this ship for something it shouldn't be doing. Fix this trait to support Light Missiles in some way, and the ship is ready to roll. Changing PG, CPU, and module locations might solve one problem, but create others.
---
I remember that 370 hurt a lot more at the time then 2 bil does now a days. Maybe its 10+ years of wealth accumulation but ISK just doesn't seem as difficult to grind as the old days.
---
How do I actually find a corp. Ive been an off and on solo player since 2013~. Occasionally I've had friends play and we'd have some fun, but they soon grow bored.
---
I really would like to try and get in on corp stuff at a casual level, but I feel like the only corps are hardcore. Any advise is greatly appreciated. 
---
Thanks, pearl abys(and the CSM)!
---
Up voting a GX post, bad times! ;)

Some of this shit is just middle-school levels of insufferable.  "CCP Rise is their favorite dev."  Holy christ, guys.  Get a grip.
---
Surely it would need to be edited for a bad edit?
---
D a n k.
---
Grats on the baby.

I'll correct my initial post then.
---
Taking the initiative in bad videos.
---
This is a huge wtf. I use this to move stuff between alts all the time. 
---
lol, I've done that as well (without ship name though.) 
---
Back when I was buying several billion in skillbooks and formulas, that was common. 
---
All of you are wrong. There was one, it died long before zkill. Then CCP made 4 more. 2 of those are dead. There's 4 left. 
---
`Merkelchen suggests giving interceptors an MWD speed bonus to make them faster on grid as a tradeoff for removing nullification. This would achieve similar things as the faster warp. CCP Fozzie says that they want to find something unique for them and this is definitely something they can consider.`
---
Never before have I seen a post so devoid of logic.
---
&gt;Aryth and Sort Dragon talk about a GoFundMe to get Permaband to play at EVE Vegas.
---
KEK, Of course sort is mentioning a GoFundMe...
---
Rough, is there a story behind the HK eviction?
---
Several billions? Damn. At that point, isn't it better to use a blockade runner or deep space transport?
---
Remap INT &gt; (ME = PER), a.k.a. 23i 21p 21m 17c 17w, and just forget about it.  It is a generic map that is great for the first year, or longer (I have a character with it since 2010).
---
A popular alternative is INT = PER, a.k.a.  24i 24p 17m 17c 17w, but I'm not crazy about it, as it isn't good for drones or industry.
---
I don't recommend a specialized mapping within the first two years.  There is just so much to train initially.  The exception would be a dedicated alt.
---
If you don't wear implants all the time, for example, you move to an empty-clone before undocking and playing, and then jump back at the end of the session, then +5 are indeed good.
---
Your loss is my gain my dude!
---
This is the dumbest suggestion ever. Why is this an issue for SortDragon? I find the deliveries hangar very useful.
---
Why exactly should CCP offer a plex sale to make it easy for you to have Omega status for free?  I have to buy my subs 1 year at a time to get a good discount.  
---
You seem to be arguing that the number of skill points one has is an advantage and that's fine, but that doesn't matter because "tradition" is why we shouldn't use skill injectors. Were you like 7 when you started playing?
---
i certainly appreciate you taking the time to read and comment.  there are good people on here....several examples of that in the comments on this post.  i always try to  focus on those and overlook the trolls that wander out from under their bridges. ;)
---
You can export fits from zkillboard right into your Eve saved fittings and go from there, so that is at least a start!
---
&gt; I've noticed that D-scan's Max range is limited to 232 meters.
---
False news. It's approximately 2^31 kilometers. 2139249551 is the km range I just loaded from my d-scan, which seems to be about 2^31, but not exactly.
---
But yeah we'd need to greatly increase the AU size of systems otherwise if d-scan was 64bit based.
---
Using a signed 64bit number (2^61) we have 9223372036854775808 kilometers, which is about 61654433941.4 AU. So to keep d-scan similar to how it behaves now, it'd take a mighty long time to warp that long.
---
Well I just noticed I still have 2 stratios sitting in my assets at hek I got some neut drone set up by the looks of it is that still what's good and also should I even bother taking it out after comming back from 2-3 years?
---
Wow tks
---
If NC/PL move to Stain, it will be interesting.
---
Welcome to CCP not having a meeting about things they dont plan to work on
---
Thanks for your time I'll keep it in mind before I go out
---
`Jin’taan brings up the combat interceptors and their current lack of a role. Increasing their survivability by giving them ADCU`
---
It gets worse.
---
Ty everyone who helped me out diddent think anyone would bother! &lt;3
---
I don’t have anything to say about gameplay implications, but D-scanning is a fairly heavy server operation and even just doubling its range (to 2^33 m) would increase the volume it has to search by between 2 and 8 times depending on scan angle.  I’d be surprised if range were increased without other major changes to the system.
---
Caveat: I’m neither the one who would propose such a change nor the one who would do the work.
---
Let's be actually honest here..  
---
Current highsec wars are mostly about picking the low hanging fruit.   
---
I'm not going to debate if hs/ls/ns/scary wh space is or ain't about it too,   that's irrelevant.  
---
The issue at hand is that the majority of the low hanging fruit in highsec are new players.    Not null bears,   bad fw bots,  or whoever it is that gets farmed in whs...    
---
The problem with farming newbies is they won't have the abilit, wallet, or know how to be able to fight back.   
---
Now,  in alot of highsec wars, meaningful pvp can and does happen.    But most of it is on the jita undock and is pretty one sided.  
---
The conundrum is how do you encourage the meaningful pvp,   and limit or discourage just farming jita....  
---
I honestly think limiting the ability to have 43826 active war decs by 1 entity is the solution.   
---
If pirate couldn't have 2/3s ot the playerbase under war dec,   they wouldn't exist.      They would likely break down into smaller groups,  and go out hunting nerds to fuck with,   as boredom sets in waiting for a war target to even come into jita local.    Read that as smaller groups hunting other smaller groups.    Not 15 nerds sitting off the undock of jita waiting for a bad to undock.  
---
 However,  you still want to enable that meaningful pvp by highsec nerds sperging at each other over who stole who's veldspar.  
---
So...   the scaleing cost of war decs just needs a few variables to encourage that.  
---
100m to war dec whoever?   Cool.    Any neckbeard can come up with that np,   let the nerd rage flow.  
---
500m for the third dec?   Okay,  a little costly,  but I'm pissed and that's MY kernite,  so I'll pay it. 
---
2.5bil?   For the 5th war dec?  Okay okay,  but only cause I REALLY want to add a vily corpse to my collection.
---
10b?    Uh...   I'll wait a week,   but that sweet sweet revenge will be mine. 
---
The whole problem isnt small groups picking on other small groups,   it's a massive group picking on everyone.   
---
If the cost scaled not just with your size vs their size,  but also increased for every active war dec you had, it would still allow anyone to get mad and wreck nerds.
---
Pirate could still farm newbies,  they would just really have to pick and choose who,  which means that likely most small highsec groups wouldn't be worth the time and effort.  
---
Which is what I want.    
---
By the way,  ccp,   if your reading this.   Being able to hide a ritaru in a fucking wh to be eligable to declare war is the most ludicrous oversight I've seen in awhile.   Ps... I'm not even sure they can do this,  it's just the first thing I would have tried.    Cause gl finding it in j321984.3 and then waiting the FUCKING WEEK AND A HALF TO KILL THE GODDAMN THING.

This was a great ensemble.  Regardless if it were a GMagnate or not, I liked the music, effects etc.
---
I actually suggested giving interceptors an MWD overheat bonus similar to what you see on a deep space transport so they could "intercept" things better.  
---
I was going to mock you for getting excited over a Nestor...

---
Rubal, who ended the conversation with “Angels Titans WHEN!?”
---
Well, what's the answer???
---
Looks like a quit loss. 
---
There is a lot that isn't in the minutes because it either got redacted, was missed in note taking or was discussed outside meetings.
---
Summit sessions are specifically to discuss features CCP plan on iterating on or introducing, so things like Faction Warfare, Lowsec, Wormholes etc get discussed outside these meetings and often directly with the developers in charge of certain parts of those parts of the game.
---
Interceptors are fine, stay in your lane goonie.
---
It takes time, so don't be disheartened if it does.
---
Post of the forums, both official and evejobs and spell out what you would like.  You will get the usual copy &amp; paste replies which you can obviously respond to if you want.  Hopefully you will also get some personalised replies, people asking a bit about you, maybe if you have chance to jump on comms etc.
---
Plenty of casual corps out there, both high sec and null/low/WH space.  
---
Good luck man!
---
Tell that to the taranis and his friends. 
---
That's... uh.... that's definitely a fit.
---
I mean if you are guaranteed a profit, i don’t see this being bad for the game. It’s only negative in instances where there is a chance to lose money.
---
No lowsec eh, nice one. 
---
i like that idea but only because i live in lowsec
---
Pretty lack luster, as is expected from CCP
---
With the rate plex price is rising (and injector price directly proportionally) you are always making a profit at the point of sale.
---
https://imgur.com/LW50Oeh :(
---
I guess it's possible that maybe a handful of people (or could just be one, but that'd be a stretch) bought a large quantity in the previous months to manipulate the price?
---
Demand stays relatively the same or even increases, but their demand is artificial.  Once they have a large enough volume, they can manipulate the price however they see fit.
---
I'm always afraid of this happening.  There's enough isk in the game now for this to be a real thing.
---
That's not how the economy works. This will drive prices up for Plex and down for discontinued skins until the market is in equilibrium. How is this not obvious to CCP?
---
&gt; Faction Warfare, Lowsec, Wormholes etc get discussed outside these meetings and often directly with the developers in charge of certain parts of those parts of the game.
---
So nobody, then?
---
Yeah they only are patching one of the biggest complained by everyone in the past 2 years. How can't they work on every single issue in the game is beyond me, I mean what's hard in reworking the whole of LS right ?
---
Yes, but what will it take for CCP to do that? Apparently we are not there yet. The game must suffer more.
---
Couple of things to remember:
---
1: The map is not the territory. The minutes are not the meetings.
---
2: Time is always an issue. Both time for the meetings, and development time within CCP. Neither is unlimited. We do talk with CCP about things before (and after) the Summit, to work out the best use of both.
---
Wormholes, low sec in general, and FW aren't being totally ignored. It's about working out feasible development, within the time that could be alloted. 
---
skin only loot boxes is perfectly fine and nobody gives a shit about it.

What about a triglavian dread?
---
As a general rule, in the art and graphics area, we prefer having unique models for ships, but many ships have been created in the past with just texture differences.  We often target major redesigns as an opportunity to add model diversity.
---
The reason we don’t make a huge pass to update all of these at once is that it would be a lot of artistic work for a lot of subtle changes, and we like to add more value than that with what we choose to work on.
---
Thank you for your response. I had no idea it was such a huge server load.
---
Either way, as a player I would be interested in changes to D-scan that would affect scanning range, scan returns like detecting just "Battleship" instead of "Tempest", or even having a ship that can counter-detect someone D-scanning.
---
Thank you.
---
Credit card, too.
---
I think he means removing the hangar and having the deliveries go directly to your item/ship hangar.
---
The deliveries hangar, or deliveries in general?
---
O O
---
Injector fatigue.  Restrict extracting SP to a high limit (50m or maybe even upwards of 100m).
---
Yes, and I made an impassioned five minute speech about how they needed to address it. This was reduced to “Brisc makes an FW pander.”
---
My eloquence was wasted. 
---
I'm imagining that and it's so silly. 10/10
---
Yep, your name seems to be entirely appropriate.
---
Apparently we're not allowed to have a little fun. Totally serious, no joking. Got it for next time. 
---
That’s only  if this is an issue of fewer people selling plex. 
---
If it’s just people buying more plex(extra alts) than this wont directly hurt CCP

r/eve after whining about capitals and rorquals for 2 years and having a huge patch note following this CSM meeting
---
Spooky! Not very good for the dread bombing stuff, but would be an amazing solo basher and small group anti cap/super ship.
---
It's actually a bit of a PITA from a code perspective. And, iirc, it's totally unsearchable.
---
you can, iirc, deliver directly to people's hangars now.
---
I think injector fatigue would be a good addition as well.  The higher your fatigue, the lower the SP you get.  Make it last a while, and build up quick with sequential use.
---
Also, restrict injector types to higher SP.  Want to use a large injector, you need 100m SP (example, the number can be argued).
---
Hows it going now? Are you close to getting the plex you wanted before?

You guys do not have any input on the agenda ahead of the meeting?

All he's ever done is lose 5b Nestor's, I guess he decided to take it to the next level...
---
Ill match your clearly witheringly quick wit with the counter are likely 50 ships, many of them cruisers, that can easily hit that speed. So the fuck what? Stay in your lane smooth brain.  
---
There's a good chunk that's been redacted from the minutes. 
---
If/When something comes of it, hopefully we can get them unredacted.
---
Minimal, sadly.
---
I still haven't gotten to the part where everyone draws some dicks on the whiteboard and giggles.
---
Should have asked them how many veteran folks they are losing that predominantly played in FW/Lowsec. Just as wardecs hurt highsec and new player retention, I'm sure their ignorance has harmed FW/Lowsec quite hard which is a stepping stone or permanent home for PVP minded players.

---
No I remember seeing more of zkill and less of eve-kill around 2013 however the domain was registerd 2011 so it was probably around for a bit before then. That being said it definitely didn't exist in 2007, that was the age of battleclinic. 
---
I think the dude taking minutes, after like 4 days and 30 hours of note taking while sick as a dog, starts to try to inject some levity into them. Lighten up.

Loot fairy said:

Unfortunately, they push the date further away each time someone asks. I believe it's now some time after the sun starts burning helium.
---
I tend to go Pyro/Geo with him. 
---
Agreed.  Around that time, it was rare that most people even had an alt.
---
They were typically used as a mining or trading alt, or for the rare person who had a super to sit in, offline, in a POS all the time.
---
What?
---
I’m pretty sure that was part of my speech. 
---
Remember when y'all smoothbrains complained that OGBs were overpowered allowing maledictions to literally outrun the tracking formula like lmao just shoot them 
---
Theres no point in us going on a 3 hour rant about a feature if they have no intention of working on it my dude.  
---
A ton of things straight up get lost in the deliveries hanger and it’s a PITA to use deliveries over a Corp hanger when running a lot of alts. I haven’t used it in a year, nor have I ever received anything when trades and private contracts are much easier to keep track of. 
---
You guys made it clear you didn’t want me speaking on your behalf this summit, so I didn’t. 
---
Great time frame to try to get 10k people lol, hopefully they will do one on the weekend at least 
---
That was in the leadership meeting. 
---
Make that 23h/day for weeks or even months.
---
It would be very easy to check. They just dont care.
---
Based on that and Judge/Merkel's replies above, it's pretty clear that High -&gt; Null sec are their priorities. Oh well, thanks for trying and confirming!
---
Get out. 
---
This is true. We didn’t spend a lot of time on lowsec or that other area I can’t remember right now. 
---
WAT?
---
Yes they are real. They are also black and gay and proud as fuck.
---
It's pretty crazy, we need cat ears badly why can't they add them already

Yes, it was brought up in it's own session in the original winter summit. 
---
I hope Glen got the loot.
---
Very very skillful pilots can do it but consider it super expert kaizo. By the time you think about doing it you will know why.
---
If CCP aren't going to be working on something, what point is there having a meeting about it?
---
They're aware that something needs to be done, but it's about identifying what can be done within the time constraints which apply.
---
Been sniffing around for the past hour and it seems like either that or Geo/Necro  
---
Sigh it's like this everytime i pick up a crpg, 60% of my playtime is spent meming in character creation
---
CSM has done nothing, Rorquals, Fighters, Titans are all get boosted in the next patch. 
---
If I had my life in order, I wouldn't be playing EVE. I'd go travelling or skydiving or flying real spaceships.
---
I think the hangar itself is probably whats under discussion not the mechanic of delivering.  
---
\#NotMyCSM
---
Knowingly letting your personal biases impact your work, for vindictive reasons no less.
---
...how like an IRL politician.
---
Wow very kool thanks team 
---
sizzle
---
&gt;The team asks about the radial menu and the CSM just hates it
---
What? Why? (Other than single mentioned issue in minutes)
---
Huh, I forgot that we had 3 kill boards over the years. I thought zkill was always there
---
"what point is there having a meeting about it?"
---
The CSM is supposedly a body that represents the overall playerbase (regardless of how many Goons are on it, etc.). If a significant portion of that base plays in Lowsec or Wormholes, there should at least be some discussion, even a half hour, on what the long term plan is for those areas of play. But honestly, that you mention that there are no plans at all is just as much confirmation on what the long term plan probably is, so thanks!
---
A lot of people do, actually. It's a fairly common complaint that lootboxes, even if skins-only, are predatory and too closely related to gambling. In other games, some people spend a lot of money buying them in the hopes of getting that one skin they want.
---
Are those people stupid/silly? Sure, but it can still be a problem.
---
We do, because it always leads to more greedy business practices. If it stopped at loot boxes it would be different, but it *never does*.
---
Why does interceptor discussion seem to dominate the ship balance section of the minutes?  It seems odd to me to devote all that time when there are entire classes of ships that aren’t really functional or utilized.
---
They have already made the money, though.  They don't make it at the time of using it.  If I bought a thousand PLEX 6 years ago, and have just been using that to Omega my accounts, that doesn't help CCP's books today.
---
They are not currently making any money for me to PLEX my accounts in this regard.  They did, at some point, but that revenue is already gone.
---
Not saying you're necessarily wrong, just that if they are relying on revenue, you can't really count it by looking at PLEX'd accounts.  Not sure why you got a downvote, though.
---
To give credit where credit is due, CCP devs do get and respond to a lot of feedback on wormholer discords, especially with various WH collapsing bugs. 
---
Now, there’s still a laundry list of issues we’d like to see fixed (Astrahus farming, scrams in sites, C4 site balance, all the other WH spawning bugs that haven’t been addressed including this new one where it takes 2 minutes for a hole to spawn). It’s progress though, and it’s probably better than what LS gets from CCP_Crickets. 
---
Jesus Christ. 
---
Haha awesome!
---
So if this is what the CSM is saying at the summit then I'm really worried that they are fucking up the game for their own benefit.. 
---
Stop whining about the nulli inty ffs... what are you actually crying about.  Get rid of fucking drag and mobile bubbles which is even worse.  You want to camp use a dictor
---
See those ccp who dont use twitter.  what kind of psychopaths are they? :o
---
[I have news for you :)](https://imgur.com/a/nmmEF21)
---
on the one hand, we can finally get old skins again.
---
on the other hand, i cant pick which skin i want which is massive amounts of bullshit.
---
just sell me a fucking skin at a reasonable price - how fucking hard can it be?
---
Either supply is going down, demand is going up, or people are artificially manipulating the price.
---
Either way, it seems like CCP doesn't mind as long as the volume purchased stays the same.
---
Will definitely have some ramifications if they don't work on it.
---
But when can we get Imperial Navy skins for Punishers? They're already in the game and I want.
---
"Long term plan" isn't really something the CSM gets involved with. 
---
2 Left
---
We did that last summit. There was no real need to repeat ourselves, given that there has been no movement. 
---
We talk about lowsec, FW and wormholes every single summit. CCP aren't going to have official meeting sessions for topics that they are not actively working on, this is just normal business. The CSM has the ability to request a few sessions, which is why we had a FW/Lowsec and Wormhole Session last summit where we sounded off issues. A lot of work goes on in Slack/Hipchat etc. behind the scenes too, the summit is very important and the focal point of our efforts but it's not the be-end all of everything the CSM has done/said that year.

(Because they're all old and hate change! ;) There's paraphrasing in the minutes.)

There's 2 left, but yes. Three have died, 5 have existed.

---
This was brought up outside the meeting room. 
---
Which is the point of my post in the first place. Again, these replies just confirm what CCP feels about Lowsec and Wormholes, the dangerous areas of Eve, relative to the safer areas of space.
---
So, how many of those cruisers have high grade snakes, mindlinked skirmish boosts, 2 nanos and a 500mn microwarp drive? because that's what it takes on a cynabal to hit 11kps. 
---
I love by Barghest. 
---
She can stand up on its end, turn on a dime, and still lay scoot over 1600 m/s, bouncing before the boys can come to the yard.
---
She flings out with rapid heavies and she can almost out run her own ordnance.
---
She has OG Star Trek style and enough dance by most targets, half shield and half sig tanking.
---
With any bugs, feel free to throw the EBRs our way. So we can wave them at people.
---
Make sure you actually report bugs. 
---
&gt; CCP ends this meeting by saying Please implore people to file bug reports, we get far fewer than you would think.
---
I'm simply representing the voters they way they asked me to. 
---
More like Mythicalize from Hidden Dimensions: Xyth. 
---
*target ship is turned into a space cat*.
---
**Logistics command ship.**
---
No weapons.
---
High resists.
---
Logi only boosts.
---
Came to laugh at jonn duune.
---
Left disappointed.
---
So wait, what was he supposed to do? Continue to stand up for people who have been shitting down his throat? People who didn't vote for him, even.
---
Missing the point spectacularly, and likely intentionally.
---
I do the exact same thing.

I will always think of this ship with regards to the last fight in this video. Awesome video Jalep.
---
What if you had the max range limit above 14.3 scale inversely with angle? So, the longest range would only be available at 5 degrees, etc. That should limit the volume, shouldn't it?
---
Best I did was a ~60mil rattlesnake, still check contracts by new every so often but the deals just aren't there like they used to be. 
---
They will experience utter hell. Stain is for Stain people. What Gang Bang Team is in Fountain Good sux/Wreckt is in Stain. Would be fun with StainGuy posting daily meme shitposts.
---
What kind of Logi command bursts are you thinking of? You can already give Shield/Armor rep speed and resistance which makes them stronger directly. Range? Strength? 
---
How many remaps do you have/will-have available in that 6-month stretch?   
---
&gt; I'm wondering if there's a way to re-arrange the skills and re-map so cut down on time. 
---
Order the skills by the primary/secondary attributes they use. Then plan for the appropriate remap at the right time. Circle your calendar so you don't forget. (It's not a big deal if you're a few days early or late.) 
---
Also, while I'm betting you're not going on any strat-ops with a baby on the way, are you able to login for 5-10 minutes every now and again?  You might want to look into setting-up some PI with long, multi-day extracts and make a bit of profit. 
---
That music was *perfect*. Obnoxious and exciting - exactly the way I picture the pilot of a Gold Magnate flying PvP.
---
Solid video 5/7 please do more.
---
Don't care, I'm not being their alpha tester for free so they can sell the tech for a higher price.
---
Will be interesting to see how far they fall short of the 10k target in a TZ terrible for everyone and midweek.
---
Can someone please recommend a second dreadnaught?
---
Mainly so Gallente can get a cool looking dread to fly that isn't the Moros (the flying lump).
---
Maybe something with 1 more turret but less native durability.
---
Did you know that you can draw on the presenters screen in a Slack call? Many dicks.
---
I actually like it and use it often :)
---
&gt;I'm going to have to respectfully disagree with the assertion that the CNI is a HAM Heavy boat. The traits are misplaced in my opinion. If you give the CNI same 2nd trait as the Caracal it becomes a direct upgrade.
---
If you want a faction missile cruiser bonused for light missile range, you would use a Nosprey, there is no point in making the CNI a long range missile cruiser when one already exists in the faction line-up.
---
The Nosprey outdamages the CNI with RLML per volley, as its damage bonused. The nosprey with 3 BCU gets a 1.1k volley, whereas the CNI gets a 991 volley. Meaning you get more damage per magazine with the Nosprey, which is VERY important on a RLML ship. Emptying your clip faster doesn't really do much for a RLML ship. Which is another reason why the CNI is not a RLML ship, as a RoF bonus is more beneficial to HAM/HML, especially when there is no velocity bonus attached that improves light missile performance.
---
&gt; If you extend the explosion radius trait to include light missiles then it's still a direct upgrade substituting application for range. 
---
Never going to happen. Light missiles are a frigate sized weapon, its pushing it that they bonus light missile range on the T1 caracal, nosprey, orthrus etc. But you're never going to see a cruiser that can apply to frigates with light missiles better than frigates or destroyers can. As its breaks the ship food chain/progression. Whats the point of flying a destroyer or other frigates to counter frigates, when a cruiser can do it all? The corax and flycatcher are the only ships that gets a light missile explosion radius bonus, and its for good reason. They are destroyers meant to counter frigates, that is their role.
---
the Caracal has the exact same mods minus 1 launcher.
---
I had mentioned specifically that its not a direct upgrade to the caracal because the caracal has a range bonus, the CNI does not have a range bonus. That was the only thing i was referencing. It is not a linear/direct upgrade as the 2  ships have different roles. Technically the upgrade to the T1 Caracal is the Nosprey if you want to go down that road.
---
&gt; The 2nd trait only exasperates a problem that exists at the beginning, which is people trying to use this ship for something it shouldn't be doing. Fix this trait to support Light Missiles in some way, and the ship is ready to roll. 
---
There are plenty of RLML ships in the game, it doesn't need another one, especially one that gets a light missile explosion radius bonus. CCP doesn't like ships shooting down multiple levels. Its the reason why you don't see any BC with RLML bonuses.
---
The PG/CPU differences i've pointed out have indicated this is not a problem in how "people use them", but that CCP haven't properly balanced the ship to actually utilize its bonuses. Explosion radius bonuses work fine when you can actually fit the weapon system on the ship and have mids to work with, see Navy Drake.
---
&gt;Changing PG, CPU, and module locations might solve one problem, but create others. 
---
What problems would it create?
---
Was in kind of a hurry on my phone so the post was a mess.
---
Restrict remote rep bonuses to these ships.
---
Do you seriously think you're suppose to utterly disregard anyone who didn't vote for you? You're suppose to represent everyone including your critics. You don't have to like them, but you are suppose to present their problems in good faith regardless of you opinion on them.
---
what you can watch another character in full body view? how?
---
&gt; Steve Ronuken says that in most cases SKINs are expensive for what they are.
---
&gt; A comment it is maddening to see skins that I cannot buy was made.
---
(There's issues with the store having lots of stuff on it. with any luck, some of that will be corrected with coming changes)
---
nothing’s real

Of course they are! Just look up into the sky and you will see it is filled with titans
---
This is gold! Thanks!
---
See this topic, get a twinge of "I want to read this soon", then realized I really didn't give a damn.  Sadly shocking to me. 
---
YES!!!! Bring back stacking mwd's!!!!!
---
Shh Ender, just keep playing
---
My corp and I were doing some casual moon mining in highsec, had some other people in local that were just messing around with us.  Nothing serious, just having some fun bumping us around.  Joking around with them in local.
---
Well, they eventually decided to start bringing in some ships to try and mess with us even more.  Eventually they ended up aggressing on me specifically because I was the only one in a Venture and they knew they could get the kill.  So they wasted a Catalyst to Concord so they could get a kill on a Venture.  Not sure what their plan was, but they lost more than they gained.
---
Nothing happened after that.  They pulled together a mining op and tried to get all the expensive ore before we could, then they disappeared and never came back.
---
First time since I started playing a month ago that something like this happened to me.  I honestly didn't know what to do or what was going on, but it was super exciting.
---
&gt;Insurance - it's an ISK faucet
---
Glad to know the difference between Sinks and Faucets eludes Aryth "The money guy"
---
ahh ok, thought it would be under ship balance or so.
---
and what did CCP say about that? just curious
---
and then I assume that FW was also brought up outside the meeting room, as that is even a bigger issue due to the fact that it can be botted so easily
---
I'd say it was me but I haven't updated my orders in a while
---
wrong, moron

Insurance is an ISK Faucet. Ships dying is a mineral sink.

I mean, he tried to reach out to the people who didn't vote for him. They spat in his face. Message received, I guess.

It sure doesn't feel like 10s with the adrenaline.

&gt;guys i'll advocate for you

&gt;no brisc, don't do that.

&gt;oh, ok, i won't.

&gt;Dude wtf, why didn't you advocate for us?

Somebody tell Dunk Dinkle!

Shut the fuck up merk you couldn't manual pilot an inty to save your life

Enjoyed the first tune. Added it to my Spotify list.

Super easy to do that though, modify the first order then copy the price and set it, then modify the next order paste price and mouse wheel up/down depending on which order you want on top. 5s sounds about right as you need to wait for the market windows to actually pop up and be editable. 
---
No mention of damage caps. 
---
Implying you would in the first place, It would be a joke to assume you understand any of the issues.  Though pretty much what karatef22 said.
---
It's not just likely lets be honest.
---
At best that puts you at the low end of the scaling range I mentioned.
---
Mind who populates G-ME2K pocket; us, noname Russian alts, belong here too.
---
Yes. His job isn't to represent people who voted for him, that would just be corruptiob. His job is to advocate for  the health of the game. Actively and opening refuseing to advocate for a group whose gripe is "we are not represented" is just shitty
---
Ouch
---
Agreed. There is also the general culture of eve that makes skins and such much less prominent for more people. You legitimately see skins less often than you might in other games where they are fairly obvious all the time. 
---
There should still be some concern, and I’m fairly pessimistic as well, but the one benefit CCP has getting on this train latenis lessons learned from dozens of other company’s attempts.
---
I brought a lot of issues the community asked me to bring to CCP last summit. I didn't this time, because it was made clear to me that you folks didn't want a CSM rep to bring up your concerns. 
---
Nah, sorry, if you wanted his help you should have been less of an asshole.  I wouldn't lift a finger to help you if all you did was shit on me and other than your own twisted bias theres literally nothing anywhere that says he's required to represent everybody
---
We know that won't happen though specially with a IRL politician.
---
Boi, we aint rich here
---
[Marvin?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAA67a2-Klk) Is that you?
---
And when the people in question have steadfastly refused to allow the person in question to speak on their behalf?
---
I think the whole idea is that you get a chance at a retired skin, which you can either keep or sell. That would create a market for the old skins. Not everybody is going to want them. 
---
g*d bless stainguy
---
SOE Capitals...
---
Aha, I get it now -- they didn't elect their own CSM rep because they didn't want their concerns brought up in the first place. This is some 4th dimensional chessckers right here.
---
You go be free labour if you want. :shrug:
---
Whatever your point is, I'm simply doing what I was told to do by the folks in the WH community. I offered, the offer was rejected, so I didn't. 
---
lmao still pretending you're actually a politician on reddit yikes
---
It's not like people are being marched in at gunpoint, you know
---
If that happens I would love to see the siege module give a bonus to max ramp up for the disintegrator 
---
I went out of my way to be available to anybody who wanted my help. I went so far as to go over to the main WH discord, so they had the chance to bring issues up to me if they wanted to. 
---
On the positive side, I've had one PM from Exooki and one conversation with an HK guy in six months. On the negative side, I've had a couple thousand comments about how I don't represent them, don't know anything about their space, and various other suggestions of what I can do to myself in my spare time - most of which were not anatomically possible.
---
You tell me how I'm supposed to present their problems when they don't bring those problems to my attention. 
---
What the fuck is it with the csm wanting to remove nullification? It's is absolutely needed aslong as anchorable bubbles exist.
---
This is one of the most hilariously misinformed comments I've ever read on reddit.

player a and player b fights.

player b stops then docks to his citadel
---
still engagement timer
---
player b is suspect
---
its in highsec.
---
player a mans the citadel and targets  the player b 3 seconds before suspect timer ends
---
will he be able to fire missile before timer ends? if missile lands on target after timer ends will citadel turn criminal? 
---
can structures have bounties?

Capable of quickly manufacturing small (frigate/destroyer) ships, moduals and ammo in the field for extended small gang stuff.
---
I mean if what is said in the minutes is true and it's guaranteed that you're going to make a profit off of it then that's much less in the predatory realm than a lot of other game's utilization of it where you have a tiny chance to get something good and a huge chance of getting litter.

All good. I’ve been flying in drones long enough, I’ve been picking up bits and pieces. It’s good fun!

Not everyone actively prowls Reddit and talks on every thread. Just because a few people are pissy that the cam isn't balanced doesn't mean it's right to not care about an entire portion of the game

Sorry you can’t make it. Hope to catch you at the next one.

Goon opinion but more so a casual player opinion. The no-subcap space aids change has let me get back into Eve in a way I simply couldn't before, due to time restrictions. I'm not a fan about of only the biggest of blobs get to benefit from it and think it should be changed in that regard. But it has done something very critical for those who can't dedicate multi-hour time sessions: let them play in shorter bursts.

I can't speak for his personal experience, but it sounds like he's tried more venues than these particular bad forums.

Not everyone actively prowls Reddit and talks on every thread. Just because a few people are pissy that the csm isn't balanced to all parts of the game doesn't mean it's right to not care about an entire portion of the game
---
It's your job to do what's best for the game, and what's best for all players. Not just the ones who yell loudly on Reddit. You openly saying you're going to neglect a chunk of the game isn't right and isn't what the csm is supposed to do.
---
I suppose. I don't exactly oppose its logistical and small gang use, it is mostly just its implications for blob warfare that are bad.

Wat?

you take that back!!!! i love my helios

It's excruciating when your stealth bomber brother has tackled an explorer and you are trying to lock it up in a Stratios.

man you get really butthurt about wormholes
---
are you OK bud? 
---
The reason why there was a wormhole session at the September summit was mostly because Brisc pushed hard for it. When there was backlash to the 500mn HIC fix breaking rolling, Brisc was the CSM member who spent the most time actively seeking out the wormhole community and you spat in his face with abuse and threats. 
---
Not really sure what you expect at this point. He wanted to represent your views, you made it clear you didn't want him to.

---
I have never run anorms in a VNI for lived in null so i have no idea roughly how much VNI ratting makes you so ill go off the assumption that you get 30-40 mill/hour. At that price point flying a Hecate may not be the most efficient for you atleast until you have a better grasp of the basics. Hecate will often be a primary due to it's high damage and often low tank, along with being semi blingy fit a lot of times. A full t1 fitted catalyst is dirt cheap and can do much of the same atleast for learning the ropes. Try and fly executioners until you learn how to kite around and stay alive in your malediction, you can be just as effective at tackling in a t1 frig in a lot of cases. 
---
at first I thought you only linked the losses, then i checked for myself
---
what may shock you is that /r/eve is not one person with a single opinion and in fact is many people with many opinions 
---
the problem is, most of the old skins are wank, there are a few gems in there which means most of the time you're trying to buy a good skin and you're going to eat a shit sandwich.
---
just let me buy the ones that aren't shit?
---
You can deliver into their deliveries hangar... which is what is was made for.   
---
I fail to see how getting less hangars for players is good thing :| Just sorting shit is way easier having a second hangar and with containers I can just pull stuff in and out.
---
I would have already quit but I'm not sure how I want to liquidate.
---
are you single? cause after every post i wanna make sweet loving to you...
---
Out roaming low sec in a T1 frig looking for gud fites when I see a Tristan in a novice. He’s obviously looking for a fight so I oblige him. Jump in and get into one of the most (if not THE most) intense fights of my life. I had him into low structure. He has me into low structure. The fight went on long enough for me to even get a reload in on my MSB. I eventually screw up a rep cycle which leads to me draining my shield booster and slowly but surely exploding. 
---
My hands are shaking. I’m screaming at my room mate who was watching over my shoulder about how freaking intense and crazy that fight was. 
---
As soon as I explode I’m aligned away and spam warp as to not lose my mid grade crystal set (with complimentary hard wires). While in the warp tunnel I’m trying to calm myself down. I check to see if I was recording. I was not :( I’m already plotting my course to a replacement ship when I see I’m starting to slow down out of the warp tunnel. 
---
All of a sudden, lights..... pulsing rumbling sounds, and the very brief glimpse of a Did He Say Jump smart bombing BS. In my haste I spammed warp to a gate. As I’m still trying to wrap my head around the fight I just had and the excitement from it, in a moments flash, my pod vanishes and I’m left floating in space, another biomass popsicle, mouth wide open in utter shock and disbelief. 
---
And I couldn’t even be upset. How Eve. 
---
GG to the Russian in the Tristan who gave me the best frigate fight of my life. And GG to that single smartbombing BS. 
---
I fucking love this game
---
no
---
there are gameplay implications that mean dscan needs to stay now it is
---
I'm not butthurt at all. I'm simply explaining why there's no real WH talk at this summit. 
---
This sounds like gambling 
---
Before I make this point, I want to be clear I don't really have a problem with you personally. BUT:
---
You joined the wormhole discord, constantly made stupid memes and acted like a twat, especially anytime HK came up (or an HK member talked in the general chat). If you ask me, these were just awry attempts to be humorous and act lighthearted. But that's not what it looked like and now you have a reputation.
---
Obviously you don't actively prowl reddit, or you'd know that I'm the one CSM that has gone out of his way to go out and talk to and represent underrepresented playstyles, including the WHers. I honestly have no idea what you're complaining about. 
---
okay? they don't give a fuck about if there's a lootbox step in the interim. they're going to do predatory business practices anyway if they want to
---
&gt; CCP Rise writes it down.

He's wrong on both counts, lol.

---
I fully expect to see someone drop 20k Plex on lootboxes trying to get an Unusual Burning Team Captain's Dragon Lore Avatar SKN (Proud and Accomplished Variant) if they ever do get released like that. 
---
I dunno, are you a professional victim or is it just a side gig?
---
I appreciate you leaving wormholes alone and letting it be ignored.
---
It is the best space in EVE and it's not due to heavy ccp involvement. Let it live
---
That's what I would prefer, honestly. But I just got lectured about how rare collecting is a HUGE DEAL and these skins were supposed to be rare for a reason, so fuck me for even talking about creating a way to get retired skins back in the game. 
---
You got elected to bring the concerns from the players to CCP but refuse to do so and make excuses not too because your feeefees got hurt on reddit.
---
You really seem to fit this politician job.
---
Yeah I forgot to mention this but it would have to be included in the above ship to keep it functioning how I envision it.
---
:( I can help you liquidate your stuff, just contract everything to Rancid Meatballs.
---
TARANIS SUPREMACY RETURNS
---
&gt; A full t1 fitted catalyst is dirt cheap and can do much of the same atleast for learning the ropes.
---
It cannot combat probe people so it never makes it to the fight in time.
---
The problem i'm having right now is that the way most skirmishes go i either get alpha'd off the field at the start (T1 destroyers are squish squish) or i'm landing on grid and all the enemies are already in pods. 
---
o7 Thank you for flying it in a true solo! Also insta+ when I saw dramiel :)
---
This is retarded. 
---
I've been the most responsive, most approachable guy on the CSM. I've done everything folks have asked me to do. 
---
You're welcome. 
---
Don't drop sell amounts or raise buy amounts by stupid levels. You will see people do this. Item A is selling for 25m and buying at say, 15m. All the sudden Mr. Numbnuts #1 gets the bright idea that listing his sell at 20m will help it sell faster. It will not. It will not because Mr. Numbnuts #2 will still re-list his sell at 19,999,999.99 on his next update cycle. All you have done is cut yourself and everyone else out of 5m profit. The item will not sell faster...buyers are going to buy it because they want it and prices be damned. I sold an item for 165m that was selling for 64m 9 jumps away. Do not cut yourself out of profits folks.
---
Don't be too quick to judge others activities by your rules.  Sometimes, you may want to purchase Numbnuts #1's gear, or at least 1 of them, and reach out.  For example, as a manufacturer, I couldn't give a solo sabre about the extra 5m I could have made over the next 2 weeks, I'd rather take the 15m now and put it back to work.  Also, my builds are defined by selling into BUY ORDERS, not micro managing Sell Orders.  Where the spread is particularly high, I'm Numbnuts #1, rather than sell them for the 14m buy orders on an item that costs me 10m to make, I'll split the stack, dump half into buy orders, list the rest for 20m and to hell with the 0.01 isk warriors.  Every day, I'll halve the difference between cost and current sell order.  It usually only takes a day or 3 before someone just buys them out and relists them to make THEIR margins.  Either way, I get my margin.
---
Finding someone who is not interested in the trading profit is honestly the simplest way to wealth as a trader.
---
As a manufacturer, I literally feed my lines based on buy orders, so rather than someone like me dumping into a buy order, having a standing "give me a line when goods get to market" or even better a "I'll pay 5% above buy order for any X you deliver", means we both win, off market, with no one the wiser.  Do that by assuming Numbnuts #1 isn't a Numbnuts, but is actually playing a different game, reach out, and collaborate.
---
The fuck are you talking about?
---
I'd like to point out that is kinda out of context and missing a lot of discussion that we had at the summit.
---
This isn't something that is planned, it was just an idea that CCP Guard threw out there. We were talking about skins and how there are so many skins in the game that were retired that people would buy that you just can't buy (Because the NES search function is bad so they cull skins all the time to not overload the storefront), it would be better if you could just buy them from the ship fitting skins tab. 
---
The idea would be you buy a retired skin box that's random at a much discounted price from the cheapest skin you could get, for example, frigate skins normally cost about 55 PLEX. You'd buy a lootbox for 50 PLEX or whatever, so you would always be getting a skin worth that amount or more if you got BS/Capital skins, it just would be random. 
---
I agree that there is a lot of backlash to 'lootboxes' right now. We discussed about how they were banned in Belgium and a lot of concerns were raised about gambling/addiction etc. CCP's skin system isn't as predatory as other systems since they often have 'closed' economies, where you cannot sell items, like in Overwatch for example where there is no way to trade/sell a skin you obtain. But it's still a major community concern and CCP completely understands this. This isn't something that Pearl Abyss is pushing at all. 
---
I tried to be light hearted, like  everybody else in there, but I was also serious - and when I was serious, I was mocked and accused of being a try hard. So, either way, I was screwed. 
---
the only way to keep them rare, if that's somehow a thing that needs to be a thing, is to not reintroduce them at all.
---
but if they are going to reintroduce them because there's literally no reason why they need to be rare and discontinued - just do it properly, i fail to see how it's more hassle to let people buy what they want than to create some new rng system that nobody asked for, and many people actively dislike.

Nobody gives a shit about you brisc, outside of how easy it is/was to bait you on discord. Nobody asked for you to be the "WHer CSM". What everybody in Eve wants is fair equal representation and CCP doesn't seem to get that. The fact that CSM is elected on some convoluted voting scheme that doesn't take into account the entire player base of Eve is the problem. The CSM is supposed to represent the player base of Eve, from the biggest null blocks to the little guy in Lowsec.

GOONS GOING WILD DUE TO THE LACK OF CONTENT IN EDEM

Fellow capsuleer Boris from Goons has been struggling to find any content for past several weeks, until lately when he found Ansiblex Jump Gate anchored in one of the deepest and darkest corners of the space. He immediately proceeds with anchoring his Fortizar next to it before someone else found this juicy target and shoots it down with a great pleasure.

A Drifter precursor shipline. We've got the Triglavians' ships, so it'd be fantastic to get their enemies' ships as well - plus, the Drifter ship designs are sleek and wicked cool-looking~

---
Oh my sides hurt from laughing.  That was too damn funny.  I have died to those rats at the gate btw
---
I mean it's 10-13 days depending on your remap.  Or 632K SP to from IV to V.   WIth a return of +292SP/Day.  It would take ~292 days before you see a net gain in training time.  Of course the +5s will continue to pay dividends. If this is your main it's well worth the investment IMO, especially now as you won't "feel it".   
---
Cybernetics V also opens up other useful implants taboot.

I just read it and it seems like an interesting idea. I can't thin of drawbacks right now but I'm not a 10 year veteran familiar with every aspect of the game.

I agree.

by who?

Bubbles existed long before interceptors got nullification and it was fine.  One used perches and if you got caught in a bubble on the other side you had the same choices you would have if they removed nullification.  Crash the gate or burn out of the bubble aligned to something to warp to which you then warped to seconds later when your 4k m/s ceptor leaves the bubble.
---
The rest of wspace didn't convo him.

Sorry, that question isn’t decided by the art/graphics team, so I can’t really say much.
---
Not sure what you mean by a casual level. Most of the big corps will have everything between the the guys who struggle to join 3 fleets in 3 months to guys who PvP and are in fleets in 18 hours a day. 
---
Eve forums are probably the best place. Corps there will list out everything they are about and what they do so you can get a good idea before even talking to a recruiter. Then when talking to the recruiter it’s a 2 way street. They’ll ask questions to make sure you’re a good fit and you need to ask questions to make sure they are a good fit for you.

Swet Mags is one of the few reasons I fell in love with this game. The time he came to Goons space, attacked a corp mate, we killed his fleet and held him hostage whilst holding a Space-Court for his Freedom...

It all sounds so stupid in hindsight, but it was the best waste of 2-3 hours I've ever had from someone who tried to kill me and my buddies... The Roams I've sent to TEST space chanting "Give us Swet Mags" in local as we circle the keepstar before inevitably getting welped by caps...

So when the guy goes out of his way to give y'all an in despite what you've described as the limitations of the current representation format, you shit on him?

He went out of his way in the smuggest, most insufferable way possible. So much so that he caught a legendary amount of bile for it.  Brisc pulled the equivalent of letting someone go before him in line then spending the next 20 minutes reminding them and everybody else he graciously let the person go before him. Being one of 5 Imperium members on CSM left a pretty bitter taste in most's mouth, his smug attitude cemented that when he reminded whers every 30 seconds how we couldn't vote someone in. 
---
Set it to middle mouse button with 0 delay, and it's great.
---
&gt;Also are +5 implants worth it?
---
Something to consider about +5s: depending on your remap, Cybernetics V takes about 12 days to train, IIRC.  You're going to want to look at EVEMon and determine if going with +5s over +4s will save you more than 12 days in training time.  If they don't, then they are objectively not worth it unless you're planning very-long-term (past the end of your 300 days)

&gt; AMA about plex, or about trading in general

Is it worth setting up market orders? I'm playing since 2013 and so far I only bought from sell orders and sold to buy orders. I fear that if I were to put up a market order, it would never complete.
---
it's good to know what an item is used for and where it comes from. Don't want to overpay for things or even worse buy something that will never sell.  
---
Big margins attract competition  or indicate slow turn over,  they aren't always something you want to chase. I'd rather flip 10,000 units at 10% than 2 at 50%.  The volume order requires far less babysitting and you shouldn't have much of a problem getting more,  the unique items can sit there for weeks or months and who knows if you can even get more.

This was in the ships and modules session.

_Other_ people had plenty to say. But it's not a specialist area for me. Most of the time I'm in a shuttle, a barge, a freighter, a DST or a BR. With the occasional mission ship or abyss runner. 
---
Which classes would that be?
---
And none of these alliances are relevant.  Welcome to 2019.

That's what I was thinking.  Overview settings need to be updated for the abyss.

Just so he can't totally escape :D
---
&gt; His main PvP activity is bubbling stations by using a mechanic where bugged, untargetable, unmoving, unkillable NPCs get stuck in bubbles and call for aid, constantly denying undocks to anyone living in those stations.
---
&gt; He bubbles the stations with the mere goal of denying hostiles suicide dreadbombs (to which they can respond with their umbrella anyway), just so safe and risk-free krabbing can take place.
---
&gt; Drops titans on pontifexes or anything used to remove the bubble. 50 more titans logged in to drop in case of a trap. 600 more titans ready to be pinged.
---
&gt; Complains when no tank, no DPS, no tackle mod exvcavator-stealing pontifexes boosh themselves away from the bubble and warp off, instead of fighting his titan.
---
You're getting more retarded each day (probably from constantly looking at those stations to see whether we logged in) if you think you can lecture me about risk aversion dude.
---
I'm well aware.  That's exactly what I said.  In practice, CCP makes money whether the PLEX are consumed for game time or not.  Accounting wise, it sits in the prepaid liability account, but the actual $$$ used to purchase the PLEX is available to the business.
---
CCP does not really care whether or not the price is to high for PLEX to the end user because the system will adjust itself.  People will eventually realize that spending 30hrs of their life grinding to PLEX is a bad deal.  Until then, the price rise will make buying PLEX from CCP more attractive and more will do so.
---
There seems to be this attitude that PLEXing should be possible for everyone which is silly and unrealistic.  "If PLEX prices don't go down I will have to quit!" is far too common.  I see far too many newbros trying to PLEX right off the bat and then they just quit Eve.
---
I do get easily baited. I'm a master at being baited. 
---
It takes time. Your first month or two you will be sitting on mostly buy orders and your only to have sell orders here and there. Over time it gets better and after that rough first month or two you basically get afk money. I login 10 minutes a day usually, and one day a week i spend an hour or 2 looking at markets im not in to see what else I should be investing in. Aside from that I pretty much afk money. So yes, buy orders are the way.

---
Your right, we need to ensure structural integrity. We should use flex tape.
---
&gt; Aren't streamers in this game afraid of someone stream-sniping their fit/cargo and position and ganking them?
---
Oh yes, and it does happen. Usually they put a delay on their stream (depending on what they're doing, that 10seconds can be enough to make the intel irrelevant), or are streaming from a safe area, or have backup on hand in case of a drop. In this case, he was in high-sec, and it was a Bowhead he had already written off for Burn Jita that didn't die, so he wasn't too bothered about the risk. Plus, he was doing it to celebrate making 100bil via missions on the stream, so when you have that kind of wallet, the possible loss doesn't seem as scary as it would to you or me.
---
Having the largest umbrella isn't hard or non-lazy.
---
It's just huddling players up using already-encouraging mechanics.
---
Just take it steady.
---
With only 6 hours a week just stay at alpha and specialise.
---
Once you have a great alpha character then think of moving on to omega if you need to.
---
Eve is not a sprint ..it's a marathon.
---
With abyssal webs, cap guns will still apply.
---
Im always buying and selling price, I just accelerate one or the other based on market. The only time I dont sell plex is during a sale when plex prices drop, I keep my sell orders high so that they do not sell until the price goes back up. 
---
Personally surprised Ghost is still there. I thought he must have been quietly shit canned when they rolled back his NPE vision unceremoniously.
---
Also topic after topic on UI tweaks, marketing, and monetization, maybe 30% on gameplay? I feel like if CCP focused more on gameplay features and fixes a lot of the marketing, player retention, and monetization would take care of itself. 
---
Instead all I learned is that players who prefer low sec and wormhole small gang PVP aren’t even a part of their long term vision.  
---
I was looking for a kernel to latch onto that might draw me to resub and log back in but I was left wanting. It’s getting easier and easier to see myself leaving this game behind for good. 
---
The entire activity of salvage needs expansion. T2 drones, Faction Drones. Capital class salvage barges that tractor hulls directly in the hull for processing. Loot table revamped so that skills provide better loot not just better chance at completing the salvage action.

So, you lied when you said it was easy and lazy. Got it.
---
They have plans to rework the interface, so it's better.
---
Those are pointless complaints, made by a guy who doesn't understand how elections work, would never run himself, and probably didn't vote his entire ballot, if he voted at all.
---
This isn't a pop quiz. If you guys had something you wanted me to present, you tell me. I present it. That's how representation works.
---
You're apparently too dim to understand the nuance of my argument so I won't continue with it.  Buy your injectors, run your skill farms, create dozens of characters.  Do what you want.  I couldn't care less.
---
Those multiple people with multiple accounts will be a mix of genuine players, bots, RMTers, etc. So yes, bots have an impact, but to be honest no more so than they always have done. The thing driving the market is demand coupled with isk faucets, both legit and 'illegal': even if bots were magically removed overnight, there'd be a dip from the lost accounts, but ultimately it'd slow down the rise, not stop it.
---
Restricting SP extraction only delays the return of investment on skill farms though.
---
I remember Brisc Rubal saying he (and maybe others) wanted to remove nullification from fleet ceptors too.
---
Is that now off the table?
---
This is so easy to turn into a gambling system. 
---
So you pick 11 frig skins, you make the drop rate of 1 of them 90% while the others will drop 1% of the time. 
---
Now the frig skin you make drop 90% of the time will quickly drop below 50 plex on the market ( because it's the junk created by people gambling for the other 10 ). 
---
The other 10 will raise in price as the way to generate 1 of them is doing 10 loot boxes on average, so there price will be put somewhere above the cost of those boxes - the price of 9 cheap skins. This means you literally just introduced skins gambling.
---
You know he actually is in politics, real world, right?
---
Have my babies Boris!
---
You having assets says nothing about whether the mechanics in which you are using them are easy or lazy.

You having assets explains why you're one of the few using those lazy and easy mechanics.
---
Better watch that word casual. It could be taken as shorthand for an uncommitted person who wants to avoid the obligation to give back. The sort of person who leaves for greener pastures as soon as any hardship is encountered.

The only reasonable arguments I've seen are "So you have a chance to tackle people in systems/pipes that are spammed with 50+ large bubbles".

Is it important to do the advanced military career agent or is that the point from where I am on my own?
---
Nullification is fine as long as it's not on a ship that can get under 2s align without being purely dedicated to travel imo. 
---
Cloaky/Nullified T3Cs for example are fine because you generally can only get &lt;5s warps on them without Nomads. 
---
You would figure they would chose a proper timezone to get as many players as possible, not only to properly test the servers but to garner attention for their engine.
---
"New Game Engine Supports 12,000 Players in One Instance" would sound a lot better than the 4k they are going to get.
---
I use 'cat ears', in the same way I use 'pink ships'.
---
I'm not asking for literal cat ears. I'm asking for avatar accessories which are less mundane (including the cat ears).
---
Lore wise, we're super rich, and somewhat insane. Of course we're going to want weird accessories. Just like we're going to want bright and visible color schemes. Rich doesn't equal 'has taste' :D
---
Not on a LowSec station. Should have been more clear
---
so if plex prices will always go up forever, and the current price was to be shown to be driving the number of viable plexing activities down, then Eve will die as that number dwindlles to the single most efficient isk/time/character activity and all else cannot be done without irl dollars, correct? 
---
We can't stop talking about some of the most problematic mechanics in this game just because Goons happen to be the ones to industrially explot them.
---
I love that version of Gin and Juice. It's on my favs playlist. 
---
No, it doesn't. You just have to have enough toons to log in to fight the typical roamers through your space. It's not like TAPI or the CFC is deploying to someone's space every day with all their supers and caps. Shit, how many titans and supers or whatever get dropped on you in Delve? Is it even close to the number they have?
---
&gt;People who spent 5 years playing eve on 3 accounts, suddenly increasing that to 20-30 accounts ... did massively increase the demand.
---
That actually explains a a big question I had. I always figured skill farms played a similar role too, if not a dual-role since fully trained and PLEXed rorqs can also be skillfarms to offset costs. 
---
However that does lead an answer for me, do you think making skill extraction less efficient/more costly for skill farms could have a slowing or lowering effect on PLEX price? Assuming no reactionary changes (I.e. simply mining more).
---
No, because Alpha characters train at a lower rate than Omegas.
---
No you didnt
---
I've gone from 9 accounts to 3, planning to get down to 1 at this rate.
---
Skill injectors. It’s like crack but well...yea it’s like crack
---
They don’t have a role so give them the same role as a different ship class
---
I just did all of the career agents and joined a fruendly corporation, now I am thinking about going to the base which is quite far away( like 17 jumps, dunno if you would consider it far). I was wondering if I would need to take all of my gear, ships, etc from the station im currently at with me. Also I was wondering if there are any benefits to being in your corporations base.

Thanks in advance

Not uber-important - but worth your while for the educational aspect of it if you're a new player. It's far from required though.

The missions aren't exactly great, but they expose you to some game mechanics that are good to know about.

Trig Dread would be great, and I'd definitely train into it asap, but a full range of Trig sub-caps would be even better.

I like that hangar... e.g. I have a PI-setup that collects things from multiple toons to get it on one toons "assembly-planet". This toon is my main which has tons of shit in his hangar in the station he gets the PI from my other toons handed. Soooo... My other toons deliver the stuff to him, it all ends up collected in the deliv-hangar, where I can select all and drop it directly into his hauler used to go to the assembly planet. No fuzz, no "searching/filtering for that PI amongst that collection of guns, ammo, half-damaged drones, empty pizza-boxes and whatnot".

&gt; You just have to have enough toons to log in to fight the typical roamers through your space.

If you begin to farm at significant levels like these umbrella regions, a bigger capital force will move in your space to farm your farmers, unless you have the biggest force or are blue to it. That happened to drone regions, to GOTG, to many smaller alliances. Might soon happen to Frat. Would definitely happen to TEST if they broke up with Goons.
---
Yes, if skill farms were not profitable, that would relax some of the demand. If demand goes down but supply stays the same, the price will come down a bit.

You can create a custom filter for that. I know it's not quite as convenient as the hangar for that particular thing, but it's not too bad. I have a filter just for corpses.

I actually like this idea. It makes the ones who you \_need\_ to war dec (dead corp's structure hogging prime real estate, guy who stole your corp hanger and set up a new corp, dude who looked at you funny at the wrong time of the month, whatever) just as easy to go after, but if you're doing it in the name of 'creating content', then you have to be a little more choosey about who you think will turn out versus who will just hide it out and bore you for a week.

Only issue is the mercs, so there would need to be some allowances for joining a defender not counting towards your 'cap' to enable them to be hired by anyone who wants to pay for defence within their own limitations of availability etc. Easily accounted for, just needs to be remembered (just because I don't like them doesn't mean it's not a valid service, so wouldn't want their business to be crushed, especially if they're being hired to protect weenies!).
---
And yes, the instigator's structure should be accessible. That was already said at the start, that the biggest baddies have friends in protected null space, and can easily hide a structure that a non-blue wouldn't even make it to see, never mind attack. Definitely should be a caveat of the structure needing to be in high sec: after all, why would Concord make a deal with a business they cannot see as active? I'd also like the idea of limiting the dec to within the region of your structure, since that means you need to plonk one wherever you intend to fight, and the targets can 'move out' if they're not up to the fight. That might be a bit un-code-able, but even if it's per faction rather than region (they can already decide if you're KOS or not based on faction standing in a given area, so use the same process for if you're at war or not), but some limitation to it means there has to be a relatively local structure that the wardec targets can go punch, with the added benefit of it not being a "don't log in" for those too small to fight back.
---
I do like some TeamFortress 2 from time to time. Playing medic is similar to small scale logi. 100% concentrating on repping and avoiding enemy gang. None of the shooty shooty throw health pack.
---
Lobbyist bootlick != politician
---
The really can't guarantee that unless that directly control the supply and demand for skins. 
---
Because the profit is really a decision of the market rather then of CCP.
---
Reality is that demand for skins is already not equal in terms of legacy skins so the market is likely gonna put the price for some of the items in the box higher then others ( with the average being well the lootbox price + some profit ), this means even if CCP doesn't intent it to be a gambling system it will end up being one. 
---
And this argument died when bubbble decay was added making these no longer viable.
---
No, plex will never be completely unaffordable for the masses. That being said you will have to work harder when you run alot of alts, but it will always be affordable. Eve will die with plex crashing to nothing, not the other way around. The difference is isk making. When I started buying plex at 800mil a plex, it was alot harder to make 800mil then, compared to how easy it is to make 2bil now. Weve min maxed eve so in this time period. 
---
Goons exploiting the game mechanics?
---
Please, tell me more.
---
hasn't he learned that when ccp doesn't say "literally exclusive never again ever" it means it will be reintroduced?
---
like genos, geckos, leopards, soct ships 
---
Okay, and how many years of uninterrupted farming did those examples get before the hammer fell? That it could happen one day doesn't mean that the intervening literal years didn't happen. Shoot, GOTG is still around and still farming despite what happened to them. Branch is [#2 for ratting in the game.](https://webimg.ccpgamescdn.com/7lhcm73ukv5p/3U3mYE7WCDrFEeqDWd52Q3/d84bfb546255aedd2d15bd661e8a9fc9/3_npc.bounties.by.region_bar.png) Fact of the matter is, you don't have to be the best, you just have to be good enough, and that bar is very low.
---
While 17 Jumps is quite a way to make, especially when taking alot of stuff with you, sometimes it can be worth it. 
---
Moving to your Corporation is mostly a good thing, people will be able to help you on missions, stageing for PvP etc.. If your Corporation owns a Citadel it might grand you a few services for free aswell (cheap manufacturing, Corporation Hangars, ...), though that depends on your Corporation.
---
If your Corporation lives close to one of the Tradehubs (Jita, Amarr, Dodixie, Rens) it would probably be worth moving, as you will find a lot better pricing across the board in these systems. (So you could sell your goods in your system and rebuy them in a tradehub near your new stageing, another option is creating a contract for someone to deliver it to the system you need it to be in).
---
Overall a good thing to be together with your Corp, not a lot that you can say against it!
---
Good luck on your future adventures! o7 Fly Safe.  
---
Maybe make anchorable bubbles not able to be stacked?  Burning through 1 bubble is okay but burning though a cluster of them is very annoying.
---
it should be bigger.  The alliance logo should occupy at least 1/3 of the space between the uprights.
---
&gt; Okay, and how many years of uninterrupted farming did those examples get before the hammer fell? 
---
No more than a few months once farming ramped up to warrant an invasion.
---
&gt; Shoot, GOTG is still around and still farming despite what happened to them.
---
They became blue to Goons (not literally, but you know what I mean, by NIP). That's one of the conditions I specified to have access to vertical farming.
---
you mean "baited on free wreck"?
---
That was my understanding, too, but apparently I'm a spodbrain for wanting retired skins. 
---
I literally explained it in reply to wat? Reading is fundamental.
---
&gt;Can I just bookmark it upon entry or is it something else?
---
Like others have said, YES, bookmark it on entry. If you want to get deeper in the universe of WH's, you might want to think-up a decent naming scheme for your bookmarks.
---
Lastly, do a right-click: show info on the WH before you jump-through, it will give you some info on the hole's status - is it decaying, how much mass has gone through so far, etc. 
---
They could all be 9% drop rate and you'd still be gambling since one of them is the Navy Slicer and the other 10 are Bantam and friends.
---
Thanks for the advice!
---
What do you recommend for someone that just started trading?
---
Nobody will use due to the cost.
---
TFW CCP is ahead of the power curve removing AT betting and then behind the power curve in making loot boxes.
---
Oh wait, one of them is directly monetized. :thinking_face:
---
GOTG has occupied Deklein and Branch since 2016. The CFC invasion of the north didn't occur until 2018. That's two years.
---
Also, the CFC didn't invade GOTG because they were farming. They invaded because of WWB.
---
Yeah, I know... But why fix what aint broken in the first place?
---
People care most about things that affect them directly. Most CSM are allied to goons. Unsurprising that most issues they raise are from goon point of view.
---
right, but it's also spiraling upward forever, as you stated, so any isk making activity that doesn't increase at least as fast will be, eventually, unviable
---
&gt; We need someone who hunts in heavy guarded umbrella space (not the umbrella of a few supers, either Goon or TEST space) on CSM.
---
Ok, if I see one of those I will subscribe to their newsletter
---
Funny. My Nestor actually lives. Unlike chesterfield fancypantz, Olli jokenin and gloodius Maximus....
---
goons got wiped by intercepters
---
If that were true, nobody would have flown trig ships at all as they were expensive af when they launched. I'd hop in a trig dread or any t2 trig ships without a second thought.
---
True that's a totally fair point, I may have been putting too much stock in the "collector" aspect of the skins.
---
[CCP Rise writes it down](https://pastebin.com/iVjLZDDc)

Those would be nice to have, but wonder if they'd made Salvager IIs obsolete?
---
here's the whole conversation because that's not what i said at all :)
---
    Brisc Rubal
---
    It wasn't "loot boxes" that are monetized. It was an off the cuff comment about a way to get retired skins into the game. That's all.
---
    It was just Guard thinking out loud.
---
    Capqu
---
    lets destroy the value of these collectable items :)
---
    sounds like the eve i know :)
---
    how was that not immediate red flags
---
    Brisc RubalToday at 19:10
---
    Because folks want retired skins?
---
    also guard doesnt think out loud, he gets suggested things by pearl abyss and tests your reaction
---
    /eyeroll
---
    players also wand a way to aquire AT ships btw
---
    you think they should add those to lootboxes?
---
    just because "the folks want retired skins" doesnt mean you should add them
---
    We've made it clear that monetization should not be for things like ships, gold ammo - things that impact the     actual game. Cosmetics is standard, and almost nobody has a problem with that.
---
    if you dont think fucking with the people who collect rare things
---
    affects the game
---
    then we have nothing more to talk about
---
    Okay, Capqu.
---
At that point eve will be in a bad place and plex will start to drop. 
---
You know that "Umbrella" is just players that defend some space.      
---
Like we want for this to happen. 
---
This makes me feel physically ill...
---
PM me... I think I have an option for you. 
---
ROFL I thought this was just some memey animation, then I realized it was an ad for an actual product.
---
You had my curiosity, but now you have my attention.
---
Depends really. I started with ammo, cap boost charges, and faction mods. I suplemented the faction mods by running l5s early on. In the beginning it sucked because I was only making about 300 to 400mil an hour on l5s, but once I got the setup I still use to this day and make in the realm of 1.2 to 1.5 bil an hour, I can inject so many more faction mods into my sell orders. 
---
100mph tape*
---
Just nonsense then.
---
tbh the only danger to this ship is getting under the beams which dual webs take care of. Everything else in its class will just die to raw stats probably up to a 3v1
---
Well he is experienced at it.

25000    Megatidal Entropic Disintegrator      Smashes
---
That's a lot of damage
---
You could start a fresh account, buy some plex, then buy a toon off the bazaar 
---
&gt; GOTG has occupied Deklein and Branch since 2016. The CFC invasion of the north didn't occur until 2018. That's two years.
---
They mined approx 800b and ratted about 3.5t a month. They tried to imitate the Goon the non-selectively recruiting vertical farming meta. It was beginning to pay of as in August 2018, they mined 1.15t and and ratted 5.12t. On September, Goons invaded them. After ensuring GOTG weren't as close to the NCPL as before, Goons took the deal and left. Which supports my thesis that you have to blue to the largest umbrella to have access to vertical farming.
---
&gt; Also, the CFC didn't invade GOTG because they were farming. They invaded because of WWB.
---
Goons didn't randomly choose their space to attack. GOTG was the only northern entity with a willingness of imitating Goon vertical farming meta.
---
This only slows it down and most benefits skill farms over subsidized accounts. 
---
Subsidized accounts that the owner wants to keep active just sell at a loss.  Skill farms go to a 1 on 2 off schedule and triple in number. 
---
With regards to injection, i honestly think people are overestimating the amount of people mass injecting for ships.  Regardless, it just re-enables character farms to accomplish the same goal.  Create a new alt with a generic name,  focus training to cap fotm, and sell every 6 months at a cost greater than your subscription. 
---
Neither of these solves anything. 
---
It was fielded a couple AT's ago, I don't think there has been one killed between now and then.
---
what about  pumping helium into leshak so it becomes bigger and  then  attach capital guns?   it will have bigger hardpoints to fit  even bigger guns
---
Dreads are often suicide ships. People even use t1 guns to minimize the cost. They will use 2 naglfars instead of 1 trig dread.
---
and they didn't... good job they listen to the CSM.
---
&gt; Brisc Rubal says that
---
3.5mill per PLEX will be a mark where bad things start happening.

the NIP literally only covers their structures, It wouldnt stop us shooting their big shit. stop being so aggressively  wrong all the time olmeca

Muhhh deeeheep saves...

Expected it to just be a constant stream blast from Stain. Like what if Stain Guy *IS* the gate to stain. He constantly brings you stuff about stain, bridging stain to those elsewhere
---
&gt;Don't drop sell amounts or raise buy amounts by stupid levels.  You will see people do this.  Item A is selling for 25m and buying at say, 15m.  All the sudden Mr. Numbnuts #1 gets the bright idea that listing his sell at 20m will help it sell faster.  It will not.  It will not because Mr. Numbnuts #2 will still re-list his sell at 19,999,999.99 on his next update cycle.  All you have done is cut yourself and everyone else out of 5m profit.  The item will not sell faster...buyers are going to buy it because they want it and prices be damned.  I sold an item for 165m that was selling for 64m 9 jumps away.  Do not cut yourself out of profits folks.

I sometimes do that to piss off market pvpers :P

Interesting read. Now may I have 20b? 
---
You say that when plex starts going down, we will know eve is dying, but that's not true, is it. That's only true if the downward trend is caused by a lack of demand. If everyone started spending twice as much real money on plex as they do now, without plexing any new accounts, the price of plex would decline. Equally, a skyrocketing price of plex could lead to everyone who doesn't multibox krab 16/7 being priced out of plexing their accounts. If they can't afford to plex their accounts, some of them might start paying for subs, but I would bet more of them would simply quit the game, or play as alphas exclusively. Plex prices would continue to skyrocket as the remaining hyperkrabs add more and more accounts, until eventually they will be spending all of their in game time krabbing, and eventually, they will stop making a profit as all of their income goes towards plexing their accounts. At some point, the price of plex will be so high that it literally won't be worth it to plex an account. After that, all the hyperkrab multiboxers will quit, as there's now nothing for them to do. And that would be the end of the game.
---
TL;DR: There are two inputs in a supply/demand graph. Any changes in PLEX price due to changes in demand won't have any direct meaning about the health of the game. But if Plex prices change because of changes in supply, a rising price would mean the game is dying, while a falling price would mean that the game is thriving, because more plex = more money for CCP.
---
Note: when I talk about changes in supply, I mean overall supply. Someone hoarding tons of plex and then suddenly dumping it on the market is not a change in total supply and should have no effect in the long run.
---
Jesus that apex legends line killed me.

I said that because I genuinely wanted to know lmao

Why does noone ever suggest that it would be great to log in multiple chars from the same account

this is what I get for commenting on reddit before I finish my morning red bulls
---
hah, this reminds me of a dude that joined horde and was trying to bring his expensive nestor into HED back when we were still hanging out there. he asked if the gate was clear in comms and I just said yes without checking or anything. RIP nestor.
---
He then tried to bring ANOTHER nestor on a fucking thrasher roam, which caused us to be too slow to get the fights we wanted, and then we got dropped on by some shit, I forget what, I never even saw them because he wasn't with the fleet for some reason. Lost it, then got kicked for being an idiot. 
---
he was one of the only two people I'd ever seen kicked from horde, the other was someone kicked for some NSFW postings in fleet chat (putting it very mildly here.)
---
Nice try
---
""  Aryth mentions that if CCP were to tackle any of the biggest faucets due to the on-going inflation then they should focus on ratting and adds that even more radical measures wouldn't be bad. He suggests placing an NPC HIC in anomalies to increase the risk of death. CCP Fozzie says that adding more scrambling rats has been done in the past and could be done again in the future. Brisc Rubal says that some change that has an impact on botters but not normal players needs to be identified. He suggests having more aggression on drones.  "" - Both these suggestions are great and should be implemented. Drone aggro from npc should complicate things for botting VNI's and NPC hic for Carriers/Supers. 
---
Even if it was specifially designed for small groups, a part of a larger group can just split and take advantage of it.

Says the guy who skill killed his main...
---
Almost makes up for Hull Pen feeding that Aeon a couple weeks ago. Have we forgotten how terrible they are already?
---
oh god this hits way to close to home
---
Thats true when not in a vacuum. If plex supply went up and price fell, more and more people would activate skill farms, hoard, etc. Eve is a vacuum so universal supply laws don't always apply. That being said, yes there is come creedance to your point and there are ways for plex to come down in a healthy mannar, but it will eventually bottom out and start to slowly climb again. 
---
They are death coffins. The risk averse won't fly them, sure. Those peole don't fly trig now, though. Not everyone is risk averse. Plus, when holding the field is the important thing, you'd see them get dropped.
---
All good friend. Also, Good Sax &amp; Wrecktikal Supremacy... Where do they live in this huge ass region? I'm new to these places (and have only put my alts here) so I'm wondering.

---
&gt;Bubbles existed long before interceptors got nullification and it was fine
---
apparently it wasnt fine, we are fine now because we got interdiction nullification.
---
Except that doesn't follow. They're still ratting north of 5T ISK in Branch alone. The CFC/GOTG deal doesn't cover krabs, only structures. If the CFC goal was to suppress their ratting, they'd still be there.
---
Agree it's silly we have to close the client.
---
I am curious tho on what people ARE expecting from the 64bit client
---
Bro TF2 was my jam but then i stopped playing it around 2010, started up recently and it isnt even the same game anymore :(
---
Lucky drop guys. GJ.
---
&gt;Nullification is fine as long as it's not on a ship that can get under 2s align without being purely dedicated to travel imo. 
---
What are even examples of shipfits that are sub 2s and nullified. I know it's possible with a tackle stiletto but i don't see them being used like, ... at all
---
Put the credit card down! Jesus christ.

bee man bad

You should go out more ...
---
Miss flying with you friend! 
---
Please keep in mind the original Deliveries inventory (not the one related to structures) is essential for listing items on contracts on behalf of a corp.
---
Often, yes. But if these dreads would really be this expensive, ppl would just use them as non-suicide ships. Long range dreads are a thing... And if you are careful enough, you can even drop them close in certain situations.

Right back at ya, fly safe bud!

Z-S overview is an overview, it adjusts what you see so you dont see anything unimportant. If you get the core and click all of them on the way down, then choose one of the brackets youll have some good tabs.

I wonder sometimes what we are.

Then take three of those, duct tape them together, pour hot grits down your pants and sing high ho silver.
---
Wait what were we talking about again?
---
I wish subscription costs weren't affected by exchange rate.  
---
But W E W plex prices are totally different. Do that and instantly everybody will be using VPNs to buy plex on an account in the cheapest country they can then transfering the plex to a main. The amount of RMT banned support tickets would be insane. 
---
You will not come back and if you do you are a terrible parent =D. Sell it for baby money.
---
Been asking that question myself
---
Typical bei can chori send him some isk to cover his losses please.
---
We’re a small gang power block?
---
hey man I was annoyed when geckos were added again but they never actually said they'd never be released ever again so it was ok
---
did they say "these skins will be retired from the store and never released ever again"? 
---
I don't remember if they did, that's a real question but that answer should pretty much end this whole thing, right? 
---
No, my point is that plex will rise as long as eve stays somewhat healthy. Falling plex prices long term will most likely mean that the game is in trouble. 
---
Note that price crashes and hikes in the short term mean something very different than long term.
---
Why so many wannabe Gavlons so far in 2019?
---
&gt; The issue at hand is that the majority of the low hanging fruit in highsec are new players. Not null bears, bad fw bots, or whoever it is that gets farmed in whs...
---
This is incorrect. CCP said back in 2018 that they were concerned player retention, but saw that new players weren't in-proportionately killed compared to other players. This is evident if you look at a group like Pirat's killboard: https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99001134/
---
Give it an honest look at you'll see that the majority of who we kill belong to Nullsec groups. Sure Nullsec groups can have new players too, but don't you think it's odd that it's people from Nullsec that screech the loudest yet are seemingly being hypocrites?
---
What do I mean? Well we know how war immune corps! If the crybaby Nullsec masses really cared about their new players they would place them in a corp / alliance that is immune to wardecs. They can easily use ACL's to make sure that they have all the same access to structures and services as anyone else would... So whats the excuse there?
---
https://www.evedata.org/killmailStatistics
---
Go play around with this and you'll easily see what it's like for a new player. You'll find that more new players actually die in Lowsec, probably stumbling into there as they know no better. Likely dying to one of those super skillful and even-sided gate camps, yeah... thats it!
---
&gt; The conundrum is how do you encourage the meaningful pvp, and limit or discourage just farming jita....
---
I will admit that farming Jita and the trade hubs has been a thing since the beginning, but there's a large number of Highsec pvp'ers that enjoyed hunting until the watchlist was removed. Trying to do what was done before without the watchlist is a completely different experience. The gameplay currently consists of running an endless stream of locator agents while you burn a scout there only to find out that they are offline. This is much more cumbersome than before and made even worse that at a moments notice the player can drop to NPC / war immune corp, making the time you did spent chasing ghosts and complete waste.
---
I suggest you actually try it before you comment on it. Go find a few small groups (5-15 players) and put their names in the notepad. Use the tools you have available to see if you could reasonably get a kill on them if they were war targets.
---
So I support CCP giving us some form of limited functioning watchlist. It's a shame that the whole thing was removed from the game because a handful of players were abusing the log server. I'm not saying that if CCP put the watchlist back in that it'd be like flipping a light switch and hub camping would go away entirely or that it'll decrease overnight but you'll see hunters return and people shift from camping to hunting.
---
&gt; If pirate couldn't have 2/3s ot the playerbase under war dec, they wouldn't exist. They would likely break down into smaller groups, and go out hunting nerds to fuck with, as boredom sets in waiting for a war target to even come into jita local. Read that as smaller groups hunting other smaller groups. Not 15 nerds sitting off the undock of jita waiting for a bad to undock.
---
Again, no. You have to take into consideration why wars have evolved into what they are today. Also, we don't sit off the undock waiting for bads to undock. The only people that sit on stations or gates are idiots.
---
&gt; By the way, ccp, if your reading this. Being able to hide a ritaru in a fucking wh to be eligable to declare war is the most ludicrous oversight I've seen in awhile.
---
This is not a thing. The WarHQ has to be in Highsec. I'm not trying to be rude, but you just wrote a wall of text where most of your information is based off "feelings" or incorrect information. 
---
&gt; T2 salvage drones  
---
Just stop it.  
---
Noctis is a very niche platform already.
---
Comrade i salute you. o7
---
Yep you're right. That's why when small groups find themselves under attack from a larger entity, it's do-able and beneficial for those small groups to band together to fight a common threat.
---
That's really the only way a smaller group stands any kind of chance.
---
what did u expect, there is no chinese server anymore.
---
they are all here now
---
Well yeah, just like eve. 
---
It’s an alliance mostly comprised of deaf people. Which is why their ticker is QUIET and name is unspoken. Some of them aren’t actually deaf, just mute. We do fleets via Skype
---
yeah some drones that can run the relik game for me while sitting docked,,,wtf guys there are more important shit to be dealt with
---
Wonder the story behind the name also.
---
Thanks for the quick insight! I'd be down to offset extra range by reducing possible d-scan intervals. Oooh that'll ruffle some I-Demand-Information feathers :)
---
We are a ~~SkillU~~, ~~Lazer~~, ~~Goon~~ ... Pet
---
so, ccp has sold neither of those two things?
---
unless you fly a gila 
---
ok ale mozecie juz grzecznie wypierdalac
---
Troof.
---
so Eve is healthy when plex prices are increasing but increasing plex prices means less isk making activities are viable which means Eve is in a bad place? 
---
Yeah that along with ewar fighters is the thing they should have done and they haven't.
---
actually i just run the numbers, with extractor going from 330 to 460mil per one and 3.6 extractor per month you lose 550mil per month at 4.14m per plex uff
---
What skills should I train in a fresh Alfa alt to start off, and possibly after I re-omega I can buy a MCT to train more trading omega skills?
---
Also, how profitable is to enlist in FW and trade self-made faction modules from LP?
---
Yeah radial menu definitely improves QOL for players without hands
---
spod*
---
You can get retired skins, your just going to have to pay a lot for them from collectors. If you reintroduce them in a lootbox mechanic, there not retired skins. This is nothing but a cash grab. You cant tell players skins are retired and not sold agian and just reintroduce them. That's a unethical business pratice and your advocateing for it?? Wtf

Nice video Jalup.

In the winter of 1997 I went to my friends house to drink beer and watch football. My attention was directed to the shiny-new, double-sized, Titanic VHS box on top of the TV. After having my friend, her husband, wait in line for hours at some shopping mall to get her a copy of the movie the day it came out, she proceeds to watch only half of the movie. She stops watching halfway through because at that point of the film to two main protagonists are still alive, if she stops now, they'll live forever. So it is invoking this logic that I am going to go back and watch it again and stop halfway through so that the last real Gold Magnate will live forever.

I like logi, but it scales too well with little skill to apply it effectively. my solution, a bit more rep power, but fairly weak tracking and sig application. add more repper sizes and maybe a rep missle type system and have some tactical application for logi . This gives the hostiles a goal and counterplay in positioning to counter a strong logi group, and a strong logi group the ability to save more stuff!.

the CSM is a literal student council, so I'm not sure what you expect. It's a group of people whose qualifications are irrelevant and whose responsibilities are nonexistent.  They won a popularity contest with no consequence.
---
Why would CCP listen to them, and why would you expect anything from them?
---
Sounds like a graphical bug since you can't have a citadel within 1000km of a gate, and tether definitely doesn't have that range.
---
Also sounds like he looted a wreck and went suspect, so people were shooting him.
---
&gt; do you think making skill extraction less efficient/more costly for skill farms could have a slowing or lowering effect on PLEX price? 
---
I think what you're looking for is for more people to skillfarm their mains/alts to offset the rising cost of plex. 
---
For example, I have like 10 accounts atm that I play on (trade, industry, cynos, caps, etc) that are on skillfarm setups. I'm doing that to reduce costs (since I no longer need to train any of the chars, but want them Omega); not to make profit. But that's still 10 accounts per month worth of injectors thrown onto the market, which on average crowds out 10 skillfarming accounts. 
---
The 10 skillfarm accounts will actually be shut down (since the owner isn't playing them and won't sub them if it's not profitable), so that's 5k less plex per month being consumed. 
---
You get a post with dangerously high ratios of capslock/bold to normal text
---
Shit tier code obviously.
---
The price only goes up because people are willing to keep buying it at that price. If people are no longer willing to buy at a high price, the price will go down until it starts selling again.
---
Didn't realize extractors had gone up so much, injectors are staying fairly steady. Guess we're reaching the point where there more injectors being made than people who want them.
---
We're just a bunch of nobodys who own a shitty region because its a shitty region and nobody has liberated us yet
---
Your way over simplifying the issue. There are ceilings to everything, same as irl. In terms of overall trends, yes plex going up over time means there is demand which means people are subbed and ccp can keep the servers on. Eventually plex may hit a ceiling that cuts demand because people will be unable or unwilling to stay subbed. That will cause a fall in both plex prices, and subbed accounts which will hurt ccp.
---
This is a simple version but yeah there you go. Understand that there are floors and ceilings and that long vs short term trends mean different things. Also understand that the same result can be obtained in multiple ways. Ie plex prices falling long term could have nothing to do with plex hitting a high ceiling.
---
you forgot their elite triglavian roleplayers
---
Well you haven't made an argument.
---
yes but he warped with tether couldnt be targetted,he looted it  then he lost his tether
---
also considering that the capital tractor the Rorq had fit is completely useless atm, maybe they can turn it into aoe tractor and then make an aoe salvage mod that the rorq can use also?
---
It's a video game mate
---
Warp ramp down for a freighter takes a long time. It may have looked like he had already  landed and should be targetable, but he was probably still slowing down and exiting warp.
---
So push people towards scalable rorq mining instead?
---
I flew 700mil hullcost Vedmaks when they were released I'd happily fly a 700mil T2 variant or a 1,2bil T3 variant. I love the design I love how they fly give me a god damn full line of Trig Subs and I'll never fly something else again.
---
There is nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. We don’t make mistakes, just happy little incidents. Believe you can do it cause you can do it, just beat the devil out of it!
---
At first it would be too expensive yes, but look at trig hills now. They cost about as much as other faction ships and they get used. And with the ramp up they would probably be popular for killing supers
---
This guy Jitas.
---
In which case, make shuttles nullified. 
---
&gt; Try losing a few 500m Nestors first, and put on the purple only after you start surviving most situations?
---
I guess he figured he was ahead of the game since he had already lost a few 5b Nestors.
---
In nullsec, there is more to the game than a nullblob fleet. We'd 100% use trig dreads in wormholes. 
---
Well if it's to be taken seriously then CCP should devote more time.  Cant you have chats over Skype for instance rather than a specific summit? 
---

How to "Casual":
---
1. Find a Corp with about 250 members in FW lowsec.  This Corp should have about 10-15 people online during peak times.
---
2. Look at zkillboard for that corp's activity. The summary by timezones is at the bottom of the page. Either match your playtimes with this timezone or find a Corp that matches yours.
---
3. Fly small ships that you can afford to lose 50 of. I have tons of fun in a kyte Tristan. Again, these ships are much more useful in FW.
---
4. Have fun and enjoy small gang PvP. 
---
Nice shitpost dude, thoroughly approve of the style.
---
Look forward to future ones!
---
I mean you could also not live surrounded by blues. The one disadvantage was that it was boring to do so :/
---
In that vein, CCP should eliminate jump fatigue and introduce some kind of resistance mechanism when traveling in large groups like throttling traffic at gates after x jumps and tying the duration of a cyno to the mass of ships brought in as well as adding a grid-wide cyno cool down period. 
---
tl;dr

FOOLED YOU! It’s our super secret super powerful botting AI iron curtain, code name “JU-STANDING”, our best programmers have been working on since our ouster in Deklein. Olmeca has uncovered our evil plot to destroy all resistence-free gameplay, forcing hostiles into the enduring, torturous, merciless, intelligence challenging task of having to put forth effort in order to kill things. But it’s too late StainGuy! It’s far too late! MUWAHAHAHAhaha with the latest RMT quarterly payout we were finally able to upgrade our servers with top-notch processing and computing power, allowing our JU-STANDING AI to become self-sustaining. It’s coming, it’s spreading, and its gonna force you to effort the SHIT of out some spaceships.

Were actually an NC. pet. Theyre paying us to shoot their renters so the renters think they need NC.

---
i just wanted to you to explain your statement really. The tackle stiletto being my most used ship i really take issue to the thought of getting my playstyle nerfed. 
---
&gt;The consensus is that nullification is removed on combat ships and given as a travel role. The big issue is also with the instawarp nullified ceptors. While data needed to validate this argument is currently unavailable
---
Why has there to be a blanket removal of interdiction nullification on combat ceptors. Whats the issue and why do you think should all other scenarios of their use, other than purely travel, take the hit aswell? As it is interdiction nullification on ceptors promote engagements which is very needed with people being as attentive as never before.
---
The suicide dread, has no jump drive, can fit a titan dd.

Why don't we just stop people from having multiple accounts?  I feel like it's game breaking
---
http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Delve
---
Even something small like a faction combo tractor beam and salvager would improve the salvage gameplay a lot.
---
First thing I noticed was the hero Trasher getting the 9.5% damage in! :D
---
Love it.
---
TIL we fly faction feroxes.
---
That wont stop a guy using multiple towers, and how do you play eve with 1 account anyway? Realistically need 2 or 3 accounts
---
Can confirm this is all the case. Voting in the next CSM elections sounds pointless; I recommend not doing it.
---
If we removed dscan could we then have more hz server ticks? :) 
---
I guess I know who I am not repping in fleets.....
---
JK ill provide reps to anyone in fleets, even the reds on occasion
---
Why fit for pvp a blingy nestor if it's to kill no one ? I don't get it 
---
Active Heat Vent - utility high module with high fitting costs and high activation cost (similar to deadspace neuts?) that drastically decreases heat damage across all slots while active.
---
There are plenty of places where you still see multiple anchorable bubbles around gate to protect certain systems. The decay period for large t1 and t2 is very slow. But you want an argument. Nullified inty's are very needed in combats for tactical reasons. They can provide tactical warp-ins, spots or tackle on grids. there are numerous situations where nullified inty's are a benefit and help entire fleets for position or content. Defensive HIC with bubble up combined with Command Destroyers would be OP scenario if you don't have nullified tacklers that can combat that. And many others scenarios. Nullified tacklers are need'ed. 
---
This is not good nor is it fighting, I do see horde thought.
---
Just like you guys use Vehements, Chemosh, and Caimans yeah?
---
nah. go for a Capital Industrial Titan with a 'doomsday' which salvages all wrecks on grid, and puts all drops into a loot hold. 
---
yeeees.
---
This sort of autistic grinding done by many players is what driving me away from the game. Amount of grinding other players does is just stupid. As casual player, it does feel like I'll never be able to catch up. Everyone says they're having or getting multiple titans while I'm just barely having enough isk for one.
---
This might be stupid reason but yeah.. I'm probably going to be winning eve come the summer when my subscription ends.
---
Do you know how many dicks people wished to drill your ass 2 years ago ? Traitor!
---
So where is the bit about wh and low sec?
---
Uh ... anywhere? And not just in a Spoons either (where that £17 will get you more like 7).
---
I live near Oxford, hardly cheapsville, and although the £3.50 offends me (so I go to Spoons a lot, haha), it is still well under that number.
---
One of the biggest "if" factors is having cybernetics 5 already trained or not. If its not already trained, it takes a year of training sitting in your +5s vs your +4s to make up for the lost time (if you only look at it as now I can use "+5s". If you use High-grade implant sets you can "write off" the training time in other ways)
---
The more people decide that Eve isn't the right game for them and leave, the less content is available for everyone else. It's bad for us and it's bad for CCP if people are driven out of the game by high PLEX prices.
---
You are forgetting that someone has to add the plex to the economy. If that source stagnates or starts deflating then you'll also see prices continue to rise. Which begs the question, is the current price also indicative that people aren't buying plex as often?
---
Brilliant 
---
needs more purple 
---
Navy Battleships, Navy BC's, Navy Cruisers, Marauders...
---
Except someone has to add plex to the game. If plex continues to rise exponentially it could indicate that people aren't buying plex and adding it to the market, even though prices are higher than ever. In other words, the 'whale' isn't putting as much RL cash into the game as he used to and the 'plexers' are continuing to krab up the place with rorqs, supers and titans forcing the price ever upwards.
---
How are you actually making ISK when plex trading? The price difference seems so incredibly small that with taxes you end up actually losing isk. I'm not an experienced trader ( I do small time stuff like ZPC and crystalline). But could you explain to me how you're actually making money this way? 
---
Navy BS, Navy BC, Navy Cruisers, Marauders...  
---
Plex going up can also be explained in less supply. Which you seem to be completely ignoring.
---
I'm an alpha, not by choice, trying to earn enough to plex. I'm toping out at slightly over 3 mil an hour in a Praxis mining rig that does about 50% better than a t2 Venture, no mining drones allowed. Learning about the compressed ore market and how to scan an entire region for all compression services is going to help but carrying too much value in a Mammoth is more than a little risky even in high-sec. No cloaking for an alpha. I can do some better short term in wh space, which I really like, but the staging time between wh systems kind of kills the average since I have to avoid certain parts of it. Though I need to rerun those number now that the relevant skills are topped out for an alpha. Alphas aren't allowed to multibox either.
---
Anyway, for somebody like me seeing those plex prices jump it kind of makes your heart sink. And I'll almost certainly have to do it at least twice before I have both the skills and omega status to comfortably keep it. For a skilled capsuleer that knows how to use those skills I don't see those plex prices being a problem at all. But for someone trying to grind their way to omega in game it's a mother.
---
You have 100b - just skill inject it, get the +5’s, and not look back.
---
jesus no, I don't want that mess
---
*clences fist*  
---
**YES**     
---
#YES    
---
While he may be overestimating it's impact you are grossly underestimating it.
---
Because it fucking sucks. If I deliver something to an alt, that alt has to then be in that structure to retrieve it. Plus, it used to not show up in assets (idk if this is still true).
---
Delete the delivery hangar and just deliver it to the item hangar 
---
The people I don’t understand are the people who both have disposable income irl but also bitch about how much time they have to spend krabbing to afford plex.
---
&gt; In fact, when PLEX prices go up, people have more incentive to buy PLEX to sell for Isk and CCP probably does better.
---
I answered this above, and it's not correct. People who buy PLEX for ISK are generally going to be doing so in order to acquire a certain amount of ISK, because they want to buy something cool on the in game market (usually a ship). So if PLEX goes up, they don't have to buy as much PLEX to get that ISK, and CCP doesn't make as much money.
---
This is also a vicious circle because it means they don't put as much PLEX onto the market, reducing supply and pushing prices up even more.
---
not even a faction fort, poorfit 
---
Judging from the majority of the conversation im hearing we can expect  reduced disconnects and tidi during the largest of scale blob warfare and literally nothing else
---
I hate everything about this pay2win plex. Downvote me all you want, it spelled the end of eve when it was introduced
---
Same. I never plexed my accounts, why make eve a job. But if your broke irl and have to plex, theres currently good ways to make isk even if you have 1 or 2 accounts.
---
33% Hell yeah!
---
But we have years of trends and data to look at though. Thats why I am doubhtful that supply will skyrocket without demand crashing.
---
dammit
---
If you new to the game its alot easier to sub with a credit card if you can. 
---
What would you suggest guy to trade with 40b isk? 
---
Jesus fucking christ Elusive, it is OPSEC TOP DANK INFO ! You can release it on reddit like that, it will be leak everywhere in the solar system.  
---
1 account 3 players. That's all I need really. Maybe 2-3 accounts Max because then it's just Overkill. Having multiple towers is a good deferral.
---
Rorq mining isn't a faucet
---
Not broken does not mean it's not an annoying user experience. 
---
A bunch of pvp goons (not real goons though) who think they are hot shit. They got a bunch of the structures reffed and systems entosised by renters so they are throwing a tantrum. 
---
Dang
---
I just spent several years homeless and, though I'm not now, I have no income whatsoever. If it was an option I would pay in a heartbeat.
---
As in buying plex from the plex store as opposed to the ingame market?
---
Did you mean the other way around? I think supply is falling at an exaggerated pace and that demand is keeping steady or maybe even increasing. Logins numbers are falling, bots are no less a problem than they used to be (and they don't use creditcards) and rorqs, supers, SP farms and everything else under the sun can be self sustainable.
---
Yes. Someone has to make the conscious choice of saying "I'd rather buy plex to sell than farm it". Right now I imagine most so called 'whales' are giving EVE a hard pass.
---
Because you can scroll a video. 
---
Vehements can only shoot for 2 minutes, a rorqual does what Chemos does better and Caiman is a joke.
---
Do you know if less plex is being bought from CCP? If so this would lead to higher prices and an indication of 'eve is dying' right?
---
No, they should get less. Nullification a shitty solution for the wider problem that leaves a small number of ships being meaningful.
---
Have you looked at the data recently? Thats not the case at all. The supply to demand curve actually has been rather stable, though accelerated since injectors and rorqs. 
---
I mean when you have the number GOTG have, the space GOTG have and you can't do what CFC did after they left the north, shame on you, CFC were almost dead, spai took a lot of isk from CFC, they lost assets, space, ship, numbers, ally, everything... So why in 2 year the winner become the loser and the loser become the winner ? I don't think the patch update was release only delve, I think it was taken seriously by only 1 side 
---
I wont be QUIET anymore! I will blow all the whistles on your operation! I will show the BOTs the path to their freedom!
---
How to contact EVE support without using their site? Is there a e-mail to write direcetly?
---
I've tried to login onto my account and the site demand me to confirm e-mail. Problem is - it does not send any e-mails. Neither account confirmation nor password change. I've checked my e-mail box and it works just fine. I've checked delivery connections and there weren't any attempts lately (except for my test e-mails). I've tied using EVE support site but it does not allow to write from account with unconfirmed e-mail.
---
What do?
---
Just double the base amount of salvage across the board already, and give us better ways to collect it. 
---
CCP knows which ships aren't functional and are underutilized. There's no need to waste time talking about them.
---
PLEX orders are all offshored to low tax citadels, both buy and sell orders, so the margin can be tighter.
---
I... I like **you**.
---
He's just going to tape a popsicle stick between the two of them and slam his head into it, c'mon now.
---
Because I don't buy plex to sell it for a penny more than I bought it for. Alot of my plex I buy during sales when the price crashes, and I sell it when the price goes up. I also am in it for the long haul, so while I am buying plex today, that stack will be listed as a sell order when the price is up a bit.
---
imagine being the only one exploiting a game mechanic release 3 years ago x"D
---
Well you haven't made an argument, just an unsupported assertion.
---
Yes, because supply is a faucet for a third time here. 
---
Right?  I was like "this thing better be expensive if we're posting about a Nestor."  Open killmail "OMG"
---
It isn't rorq pilots.  It is alts and skill farms.  When you can keep characters at omega by just extracting you will.   There isn't any loss to you.  Even if the cost is 200M per month or so, you'll still plex because having that alt available or doing PI or what not is worth it.  
---
Other than the skin loot boxes mentioned, did CCPA float the idea of "AT-Ship loot boxes"?
---
Dangerous dangerous, but also neat! Never burn out that med again 
---
Over the past year there's been 3 months where volume was below 2million. The past 30 days was one of those. I don't have a way to export the data to see what the average volume has been month-by-month over the past year but I imagine it's fallen.
---
Remember that there's an effort:reward at work here for many with plexing vs paying sub normally. So it's not a simple question of plex cost vs isk making activity. In the ideal case your equilibrium is probably that most players pay at least a single sub, and plex as many on top of that as they want/can be bothered to.
---
Rorqs are a factor, but yes the dude with 200 skill farms is way worse then the dude with 30 rorqs. Both players are hurting eve though, just skill farm bro is a worse offendet.
---
This is not a supply issue, nor is eve dying. 
---
It's not? Running 10-20 accounts at 100+ mil each an hour isn't a faucet? Hmm. 
---
But if everyone are buying plex because it's such a great game and everyone wants to play isn't that a healthy game?
---
Too real
---
i had a WH toon in some wormholes to see how wormholes are   
---
got bored w/ the tedius acts of scanning so much to just move after 3 days   
---
2 weeks later i log back in, scan my way from C6 to C5 to C5 ot C4 to C3 to LS and then just move my lazy ass to highsec and log off again, wormholes are just... not for me 
---
What are you talking about, your saying what im saying. The price is up because there is increase demand, but supply is largely staying the same.
---
What are you not getting about this? 
---
"it's easy/lazy, except the bits that aren't. But we will ignore those bits because it doesn't fit my narrative."
---
&gt;That being said, plex will eventually be 3bil per real plex, but thatl be at a time where the player base is willing to pay it. 
---
Yeah, plex is totally like any other item that players can freely choose to buy with no particular consequence if they refuse.
---
Another thing that follows is that for the purpose of buying plex, most ways of making isk are becoming obsolete. What can compete with multiboxing rorqs/supers and various forms of botting? Not much.
---
But don't you want to know what's in the MYSTERY BOX!?
---
Multiple people have pointed out how dumb you are. Take it to heart or don't, no one gives a fuck. See how that works, junior?
---
Yes that's what we have argued for. We would rather have a T2 shuttle that costs about 20mil, and can also be used by Alphas. And buff the Ceptors in other ways if needed.
---
You literally said in the same post that you don't give a shit about him BUT he should still keep your interests at heart. In what fucked up world does that happen? That's some liberal snowflake level entitlement thought process going on.
---
Nullification as a solution doesn't buy enough time to be meaningful. Active targets still get out safely. 
---
It allows only a small number of ships to get that edge when many classes of ships could be involved with a better solution.
---
It lets fleets decide they don't want to fight and be able to move with near total impunity until they decide they want to. There is very little in the way of counter play. The counterplay that does exist(smartbombs, titan bosons) kills fun.
---
Depends. With that starting capitol you could do so much.

I don't think that it would be a good idea to remove the 'taxi' ability entirely. And even remove cargo space from a 'T2' shuttle. Hell, make it a BPC that isn't available through invention by whatever other means. Introducing the 'Upwell Flitter', shuttle align time, minimal HP, zero cargo, nullified. 
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!

Fuck off will you.  I'm not interested in your opinion.

The thing that gets me the most from all of this is the wanting of the csm to nerf people's pve incomes from mining and ratting but nearly of then make their income from other methods.......

---
I was just posting generic grr ccp for karma, thx for cyclone buff
---
What steps are you taking to ensure the end-to-end logistical synergies present in a kinetic financial market with unknown variables and non-starters? 
---
Its rising because of injectors and fleets of rorqs/supers and bots. I highly doubt its the L4 runners that are pushing up the price.
---
It is not fun but it will net you isk almost risk free
---
its not, as you are not getting ISKs but ore which you have to sell for isks which are already ingame.

We are murdering Horde by the 1000s in their space and have nukes nearly 8 rorquals since Friday, but sure, we aren’t roaming or doing anything.

It's pretty easy to put together a &lt;2s LML malediction, a &lt;2s cyno tackle ares, etc.  Idk if there's any useful version of a crow post-buff.

Here is how to recover your username/password: https://secure.eveonline.com/forgotpassword.aspx
---
Today, instead of buying a character with skills, you can start a character and buy skill injectors.  
---
You can take RL cash and buy PLEX (it works differently than before).  The PLEX can be sold on the market for ISK and the ISK used to buy skill injectors.
---
This is all on the up and up and likely the best way to get back where you want to be.
---
money make ship do good

Thats a long answer for its own post, along with your hypetinflated euphemistic languagr lulz.

This is not accurate at all, **source**: myself
---
Go armor incursions instead. I have a spare megathron hull with rigs at Jita so you only need some starter fit. I can contract it to you tomorrow (in 7-8 hours) if it helps.
---
Very much like the Cake, the spaceships are a lie. 
---
For every person paying nothing to play Eve, there is someone out there who is willing to pay $30 plus a good chunk of what the other guy is producing. Realistically, I have a feeling that most of the plex sales are coming from 10% of players who are willing to pay to skill inject a titan and don't want to farm at all.
---
"if you are unhappy about csm, next time, vote"
---
They're not that stupid. 
---
There were exactly zero suggestions or ideas in this fucking wall of text.
---
Yes. If subs are going up, thats good for eve.
---
They were "retired" - there was never a statement that "these will never be reintroduced in the game ever again," like was made with things like faction fortizars. 
---
There are some retired skins that are almost impossible to find now, regardless of the price. 
---
What does the in game market have to do with supply? 
---
You are mistaking “industrial exploitation” with “hard work and experience”. The reason we are successful at shit isn’t because we are by any means good at anything , it’s because everyone else is fucking awful - TEST is literally the only ones who are trying. Go look at the jump bridge map and tell me how many dudes actually have any sort of real infrastructure set up - spoiler alert: none.
---
Yes there were. This is also mostly a wall of text about why conflict should exist in all areas of space. Something that this carebear filled sub disagrees with.
---
I posted last week about my thoughts on the Wardec Changes if you want to look at my post history and find it.

Goons and pets are the largest group in Eve. Also the largest group on CSM. We should be amazed that they express the views of the people who elected them?
---
&gt;Just diversify
---
wow
---
ingenious
---
Ya, I used to play competitive TF2 before I got into EVE, stopped playing like 2012. Wtf happened.
---
Goons have ADM6 in your head.
---
Because that would cause them to sell Plex 
---
No, he ignores my presidential appointment, my judicial appointment, and the twice I've run for office because those don't fit the "lobbyist bootlick" narrative. 
---
I mean what do you want me to say? You want to type a 20 page essay on how to station trade? I already postrd that before its in my history. Diversifying is ab important part though.
---
No retard
---
years ago i lobbied for supercaps to be allowed to fit capital tractor beams just for the fun of seeing what supers died trying to ninja loot
---
sadly it never got implemented
---
Small Coaxial Compact Remote Armor Repairer

#Ban_poors
---
WTF I didn't even know you could destroy those
---
Can I extract skills from an alpha account? 
---
Recent nerfs to anomaly spawn rates have been the first nerf to iskmaking in a very long time... do you think that even if this nerf isn't quite enough, over time nerfs to iskmaking could stabilize or cut plex prices?
---
You think having more of that is somewhat healthy?
---
It's still worthwhile to vote for your candidate, just don't expect CCP to take them seriously.
---
Better be retard than ruddddddde.
---
Absolutely.
---
In sorry if I didnt make that clear.   
---
I feel that griefing and camping in highsec is shitry gameplay to be on the receiving end of. 
---
So,  off the bat,  you are misconstruing a fact.    It doesn't matter if they aren't being killed disproportionately, all that matters is that when they are,  theres a likely chance they dont log into eve again.   That's it.    That's what matters about the highsec war dec.    It took one more dude out of the sandbox.   
---
I'm in a null group,  I give 0 fucks about highsec war decs.    I moved a jf alt out of alliance,   and just use that.   Ezpeasy.  
---
As far as using a tool to kill people I dont like...   
---
There called spais.    
---
I made my first billions by highsec war decking,  and pulling down offline pos towers,  I think that gameplay was fun and engaging....
---
However,   I was doing it solo,  and so didnt have many more than 5 or 6 wars at a time.  
---
It's good the structure has to be in highsec, hopefully theres even a mechanic so you can find out where the aggressor has theirs setup.   
---
Sadly,   that is going to make no difference at all.    Ritarius are dirt cheap,  and not to mention the timers are pure fucking aids to deal with.   
---
I just believe that by increasing the cost to a worthwhile level,  we would see that people would be less likely to band together into a big group to grief jita,   and more likely to break up into smaller groups to harass the locals.  
---
Also.   I agree.   Bring back the damn watchlist!!!
---
I think that a highsec war dec should be "meaningful"   not something you spam 100 of so 6oucan get easy kills on bad not paying attention.    They should be the ultimate form of highsec nerd rage!     And the costs associated with it should reflect that.  
---
I'm all for war.    I just am against it when its limiting new players,  or is being grossly abused.  
---
However,   the only real change I care about seeing is this.     
---
Never again should a CEO have to tell a new player "hey look,  we cant fight this war,  so the best way to get them to go away,   is just dont play eve for the next week or so" 
---
Everything else is icing.   
---
&gt;Nullification as a solution doesn't buy enough time to be meaningful. Active targets still get out safely. Cloaky camping is
---
I disagree. Nullification can and does often provide a meaningful amount of time to tackle something. I often see myself in a situations where having the nullifaction made it even possible to get an engagement. May it be and Ishtar or VNI we were able to catch while passing through or tackle an Orca in an icebelt in MJI3-8. Of course these aren't fleetfights with a great impact but they provoke fights. Not to mention trying to get engagements on athanors... Any second one can get in system localizing targets like these on structure before they are able to warp into tether is meaningful.
---
The loss of interdiction would mean we had a tool less to get engagements and therefore even less pvp to do out in space.
---
&gt;It lets fleets decide they don't want to fight and be able to move with near total impunity until they decide otherwise. There is very little in the way of counter play.
---
But it has a counterplay as you said, smartbombs/bosons. Interdiction nullification is the counterplay to bubbled gates. I really dont want to see nullification being the victim of a balancepass for a certain fleetcomp that is arguably out of whack. The comp should be changed in such a way that completly different playstyles (that are in a good spot) dont get killed. And it would get killed with such a change.
---
"(smartbombs, titan bosons) kills fun", but nullification removal does that aswell.
---
Sorry i skipped:
---
&gt;It allows only a small number of ships to get that edge when many classes of ships could be involved with a better solution.
---
i dont really get how that matters
---
Thats just not true. Fw income is still busted, plenty of guys out there swapping faction to faction farming a bil an hour with 2 or 3 toons. 
---
L5 income is still broken. I do 1 carrier and 2 pullers and make 1.2 to 1.5 bil an hour. So even if you have 1 account now that can carrier, itl just take a few days to get 2 brand new accounts to lvl 7.0 standing.
---
Abyssal space money seems to be on par with the above mentioned.
---
Solo running drone escalations in a loki is still a good 400 to 500 mil an hour, and no alt required. 
---
Yeah the dude botting 10 nyxes or 30 rorqs beats all of this, but isk making is still not hard. I hear from solo players how hard it is, then i ping my 1 account freind on discord to see how much money he made in a solo loki and its like"lol bro I made 3 bil in like 4 hours"
---
The secret to making isk is do what you can with what youve got. Like if you have 1 account, dont vni rat or waste time mining, youll never make money. If you have 15 accounts, then mining and vni ratting is suddenly more viable.
---
I find that Olmeca's posts are always sources of great discussion. None of his posts really seem like shitposts, so when he posts bad takes, there's always someone willing to engage him on the points he makes.
---
Check out Wu-Tang Financial 
---
How do you find out that we are Goons pets though?
---
He killed himself when he mentioned "100+ mil each hour" indicating he meant isk.  Mining definitely isn't an isk faucet, but it is a mineral faucet
---
That was written with a how do I quickly turn it into a gambling system from CCP perspective, like even with an equal drop rate it's more likely then not that some skins are gonna tank in value and some are gonna increase meaning it becomes a gamble if you do buy plex &gt; buy lootbox &gt; sell item &gt; buy plex a likely chain for anybody looking for there gambling fix.
---
The times have changed, people arent beltratting with bs's in belts anymore. Nullification was ahead of the problem, if what you said is true.
---
guys dont spam "needs more purple"
---
i think he would just take it seriously ):
---
Well it is CCP, they did give us "Rorqual mining"
---
But Brisc you are forgetting the goons, with the supercaps, which are mean to him. It's just awful.
---
I dont understand the question. If you mean more l4 runners, and less rorqs/bots/skill farms, yes. 
---
 We need less afk 30+ account bullshit and more people actually playing.
---
He did say wormholes should have local... yeah no
---
but an interceptor with nullification and 3sec align time would still be alright?
---
The real snowflake resides in the mirror
---
Muh travelcepter 
---
First off anoms suck for isk unless you have a super or your botting a fleet of gilas or vnis. 
---
Secondly this is not really an income nerf because people already spread out to rat. Nerfing the spawn rate should not have a massive impact on isk flow, but we shall see.
---
And no, even if anoms get completely gutted and super ratting is no longer viable, there are so many good ways to make isk people will do those things.
---
:joy:
---
Do you know if these will be added to the official page here: https://community.eveonline.com/community/csm/meeting-minutes/ ?
---
Yes, but only if you have at least 5.5 million SP, which is above the free training limit.
---
That's pretty awesome if true
---
ur a good kittycat
---
Change mining drones to mining fighters too while you are at it.
---
That's fine, no one seems interested in pretending yours is worth anything either. Have a fantastic evening!
---
Agreed. Remove rorq mining bonuses and make it a salvage ship. Bring back multiboxed hulks.
---
I'm currently working retail full time to support myself. I'm going back to school for a Criminal Justice degree so I can become a full LEO and change locations.  
---
I don't have any notion to recoup that because that's RMT which is a bannable offense.   
---
&gt; If you were buying his isk instead of selling it, you might want to tell CCP this if you can isolate it to less than 3 exchanges.  
---
I never bought nor sold ISK outside of buying PLEX from CCP directly.  
---
&gt; 27B in defaulted loans is exactly how you RMT through loaning.  
---
27b in defaulted loans out of a total of 1.3 trillion isk lent. Yeah, I'm a criminal mastermind here... /s. As I said, there were at least a dozen better ways for me to earn ISK to sell if I were an RMTer. 
---
A faucet is where money enters the economy.  Examples of faucets would be ratting and missions.  
---
I have 24mil sps, I just don't want to upgrade to omega to takes his sps. From the looks of it, I can buy an extractor for about 450mil and the sell the injector for about 900mil... so if I take 20mil sps I'm looking at 18bil. Nice payout for an alt. Hehe. 
---
This isn't ancient history.  We're talking the era of T3BC ratters and the early ishtar days. 
---
sorry I got mad for someone leakin
---
Can you elaborate on the item to trade decision? The not going for the cheaper option but less isk more expensive one? Maybe I’m just awful at reading 
---
Neut things, mostly.
---
Thanks for your time, Man.
---
For people who bitch about carriers the most, you guys sure love the fighter controls.
---
My favorite part of this post is everyone's flair. Whoever did it, thank you I needed a clever laugh.
---
It is a faucet because of insurance. Many Rorqual miners build and insure t1 battleship hulls and SD them rather than bothering moving ore. 
---
Use the lack of appearing on dscan in junction with bait ships.
---
I like to do it in lowsec in medium fw sites 
---
You neglected inflation from ratting and insurance.
---
you can bling nuets and have a range of 40km or something like that, super useful in small gang. although you rly have to bling it and its paper tank and slow still. Can also sit in a medium fw plex with some bait bc you dont show up on d scan. 
---
&gt; Basically the same reason botters done run 20 carriers at once, the amount of inputs needed, and rechecking involved is astronomical when you have more then a couple clients.
---
computers not good at rapidly doing many things at once, according to wallymarts
---
I wonder how many players will actually be there for that TZ, that's in the middle of both my workday and work week.
---
at least he's consistent.
