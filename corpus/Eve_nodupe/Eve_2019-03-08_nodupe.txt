ok

Most def.. in fact you can still play Ultima Online today... EOL a product isn't just a "delete see you later" is my point... its a very slow painful death hah.
---
I pulled the plug on Microsoft Silverlight in 2010.... and its still alive 8 years later...
---
Not sure if you've tried again with the current iteration of the NPE? Also, the career agent missions have always done a lot of what you're talking about - they're now linked at the end of the NPE iirc.
---
What you need to be thinking more is like rate of return.
---
How many times can I lose a 10m heron to nullsec nerds vs how many times i'm able to make it out of nullsec with 100m of loot.
---
Now add in the fact that you're enjoying yourself acting as a covert ops agent going behind enemy lines and doing their sites, and its a profitable activity :)
---
No Semiki is a high sec pocket controlled by the Okunda Coalition. It's mostly miners and PVE'ersé
---
Ohhhh I like that. The names Mac, Acemac 
---
Even Judy quit? eve is truly dead
---
I dig it Mac,
---
Check my edit too. 
---
Just sit out in jita with public contracts for the information folders, someone will take them for sure!
---
Makes sense they have Better things to do I suppose 
---
Very much so: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmZ6NwasqiA

Jesse played you like he does everyone... and Roxanne wasn't wrong. he has to leave bcs in until they get a new home.. 
---
Yeah, but its a British startup and CCP working together. A Friday evening (defined as 7-8pm) in California is 3-4am in the UK. Even on the East Coast its a 5 hour difference.
---
Jesse, the master of EVE, all hail the supreme overlord, 4d underwater backgammon New Eden champion
---
Many of the bittervets who have that 20bn who die on a T1 fleet won't waste their time submitting the SRP request anyway.  
---
Some will even have blinged the bejeezus out of their T1 junkbox just for the fun of it, or deliberately flown a T2 in a T1 fleet, or have found some other inventive way to ruin the FC's isk-warring, like losing a slave pod flying a Ferox #nopoors
---
I tried that with a heron back in the day and after a couple of successes I screwed it up and got killed.
---
Don't miss it then, there's a heap going on in the lore!
---
I had fun reading that. I am new too so it was fun to see I am not the only one trying to figure it all out
---
That's recommended, not minimum
---
Agreed
---
Or at least the large fleets will fragment into smaller cooperative fleets. Each with a single FC, but the FC's coordinating so that they FC1 can ask FC4 for help if an unexpected titan wing drops in on him while FC's 2 and 3 are coordinating their own guys, possibly with FC1 acting as an overall admiral. 
---
Hell, if it goes that way, a wing could break off and run, with one of the opposing wings designed to intercept chasing them into another system, without the FC having to coordinate over multiple systems.
---
Could add a lot of dynamism to the game that TiDi, despite being a necessary thing, limits.
---
10000 players isn't the most impressive when you're talking 1 hz tickrate.
---
And I hope you never stop. 
---
Yes
---
As is our usual. 
---
garreth, you know ccp as good as i do. he is a paying customer with several accounts. and he already corrected what has been possible in the past. CCP won't do shit, cause they would't benefit from banning him. Atm he is the one, who got the highest watchtime for the game eve, on twitch. its free promotion for eve online. On the stream, we notice a increasing amount of newbies coming around, and players who haven't played the game before. We managed to bring alot of new players to the game. Do you think CCP will do something against someone, they benefit from?
---
The two other characters you have on an omega account can do PI, though.
---
no AT - no reason to hoard those ships...
---
Hah, I did the opposite, screwed up and lost 2-3 magnates in a row, then got the hang of it and haven't lost a ship there since.
---
Honestly, I don't think that's CCP's goal. Its more so that they can have a system that can handle 10k players concurrently without a sudden, unexpected brawl dragging the game speed down.
---
Plus, as a few here have pointed out, without TiDi, the current blob fleet with one FC system would start to break down real time. 
---
I mean, take the Battle Of X47L-Q last year. There were 6000 players in that. With the game TiDi'ing down to 10-30%, it's a lot more practical for a single fleet commander to control a huge fleet in that kind of engagement, because while the subjective time of the battle is like 2-3 hours, it lasts 9 hours, meaning they can assess a lot more in the battle and control it.
---
If it were all real time, their ability to control it would be cut by a lot more than that 3x. So it would mean that there would need to be more dynamism, delegation, and quite possibly, it would result in engagements going from "2 blobs" to "5 medium fleets vs 5 medium fleets that all operate independently", which would then drive more variance in terms of things like composition of fleets (all it takes is for one fleet to start varying composition to start a whole mess of dominoes falling on that one).
---
BECAUSE 'MURICA! LAND OF THE FREE
---
I'm kinda curious on that. I find it a little hard to believe it's only 200m when isk is so abundant in the game right now
---
!remindme 3 years
---
Depends if you include tapi with imperium tbh.      
---
      
---
Let's take a poll! downvote this if you wouldn't include tapi and imperium in the same group and upvote if you feel like they are in the same group with little separation.
---
I am glad you took the time to explain some of these concepts instead of just raging at me for explaining the difference between twitter's web server and eve's game server. 
---
I was never trying to make the argument that some type of parallelism or p2p processing is not possible. I was just trying to point out why it's a complex problem. 
---
As you pointed out above, it's certainly not as simple "twitter does it why can't CCP" like you implied in your previous posts.
---
Aether engine definitely looks interesting on the surface, we'll see how it works out.
---
Where
---
Thanks for the news wingshill
---
Big null junk isn't the entire game.
---
Assuming you are at least 5's on most drone and able to use t2 rlml's, skills at 4 just make it more expensive to run, requiring more invested into implants/boosters and more expensive mods (if even available).
---
*brisc would like to know your location*

Give me a contact in game, and I will share the info

my question is - is the game already dead because the grim reaper of youtubers has...
---
...
---
nevermind, sign me up! it's korean!
---
I’ve been playing nine years and there is shit I will never know about this game.  
---
This stinks of a trap.
---
YEAH! FORGET EVE:GUNJACK. THIS IS EVE UNCHAINED, UNLEASHED, WITHOUT CLOTHES. FORGET F-SOV, NO NEED TO ROLL BACK TO 2012, NO ALPHA CLONES, NO ICELANDIC BALANZ. COOMING SOON. TEBATSASULA. TEBAATSASULA.
---
Spodbrains.
---
Who would have thought that a diminishing-returns any-application resource like injectors that, once used, can't be destroyed, would be more valuable than a niche hull that never actually gets used in combat to the point where a komodo dying is big news.
---
Pretty sure it's like that already tbh. Modern null is a cancer.
---
There are a lot of rorqs dying because there are a ridiculous number of rorqs out in space, printing isk for their owners for minimal interaction. At least carrier ratting requires actively playing the game. 44 rorq losses is nothing when you consider the number of rorqs that are out there.
---
&gt; If you remove all of these things, they would still drop 5 or 10 to one with the next best hammer. Whatever that is. The argument would go from cap blob to battleship blob.
---
But a small gang can evade a battleship blob, because battleships have bad tracking and mobility. So that would be much better.
---
Meanwhile CCP makes excavators much more difficult to insta boosh unless you have 5+ people willing to fly CDs
---
Why would the MTU have more than one site in it?
---
I would love to see something like this. Not just for HICs but for BLOPS and marauders too.
---
Holy shit, someone who knows not everyone mix maxes everything for perfectly optimal game play, and also knows that some people are messed up enough to screw over friends they've known for a long time.
---
Honestly half the problem with this game is people who are reasonable non-extreme humans like yourself have mostly left because they know it's not worth the time barking at the wall that is ccp.
---
The reason we seem to have so many "krabs" and or "bottlers" is because those are a majority of the people who still find any interest in this game. 
---
Why have 5 barge bots when 1 rorq bot will do? Oh and it can mine basically 100% safe. Pays for itself in hours.
---
fort knox again...dont you have something to show in your new deployment?
---
On the dying numbers, I cannot agree or disagree. It's arbitrary to say that amount dying is nothing. It's good content and fights. As for the battleship forms? Yew that could be a good outcome.
---
The system has more than one site, they use one MTU
---
Highsec used to be for newer players that liked the industry aspect of the game.  
---
Then they made null industry better, and standalone... And rorquals. One f1-monkey in a rorq is worth bare minimum 5 people in barges. That's if they're crunching the same rocks.  
---
Oh and null gets the best ores in the game, yield wise. Not wormhole space - why would we put anything in jspace that might lure people in that wouldn't otherwise be there?
---
I had a similar idea I was tossing around on discord. Except - instead of emitting a field that inhibits cynos within a range, I was thinking more of a high slot utility module that acts as a jammer, but on the **cyno field itself**. It would have similar mechanics as a regular jammer (chance-to-jam) and, while the cyno field is jammed, no jump-capable ships can lock onto it. Could be a shit idea and become abused, but it seemed like a good mechanic when I was brain storming it.
---
My thought process was that the ability to jam a cyno and stop some of a cap fleet from jumping in (even if only for a few seconds) may stop unnecessary cap escalation since there's a risk only a portion of the fleet would make it through.
---
Of course they won't do shit, hell they've been ignoring highsec BS mining bots, why would they bother to go after someone generating new players? That doesn't change the fact that he should be banned.
---
&gt;goon

---
opinion invalidated, have a nice day  
---
when you learn to give people 1:1 fights that don't involve unkillable capitals give me a call
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;CCPlease:Its 2019, why havent you implemented killmarks for killing NPCs???  
---
&gt;📷  
---
&gt;Please fix your game instead of adding these stupid balance patches that less than half the playerbase care about.
---
No need because that feature is already in the game. Rorquals, VNIs, a lot of supers, bunch of other shit are already basically NPCs and you get killmarks for them. They're just "player created" NPCs. Everytime you kill a multiboxed or botted anything, that is basically what you're killing, and you already get killmark and killmail etc.
---
hahahahahhaahahah this is a great shit post
---
They batphoned nullbabies. God. What is jspace coming to?
---
I want to see if 10000 player fighting together flying super carriers, thus we can test if the server is strong enough to hold you shitty fighter mechanic
---
I will find players to help me, and then I will post the zkill. Then we see who has the last laugh.
---
sad thing is he probably needs goons now to get him re elected...and he can only blame himself that his popularity dropped like a brick
---
so sad he actually had potential. 
---
So why are the Gamma keys so expensive? Is it because everyone runs them? I have heard that the sites do not have same payout. Dark sites are most valuable because of building materials or something.
---
contrary to the popular opinion on reddit, most players don't own rorqs or titans or carriers.  The vast majority is scrounging by and trying to plex (or buying plex and spending it on pvp).  Most players also don't have multiple accounts.  
---
Most players probably play a few hours a week, do some pve, do some pvp when called upon, and end up maybe a bit isk positive.  
---
Try expanding on what you're hoping to accomplish. Also are you solo with 3 alts or in a medium corp? I can tell you than NPC nullsec is a terrible place to make your home unless you have very specific goals like running NPC missions or blackops hunting.
---
I love the fleets you bring to my EVE life. :D &lt;3
---
No, this is not customizable. It could make a good bug report.
---
Gotcha :)
---
Aren't you the guy who didn't know shit about what was going on?
---
I wish I had a good argument to tell you you're wrong.  But I don't. :(
---
the fact that init are still really trying hard to make themselves seem a whole lot better than they actually are for evicting some dudes with 1.4k people is the most pathetic thing ever.
---
google the auto-upodate / linking spreadsheets to ESI, I haven't done it personally but they are out there

---
Provi no doubt
---
Imagine how frustrating it would be in severe Ti-Di with jams and ECM bursts all over the place. 20min in you start doing your max damage and BAM you are bursted.
---
Triglavian HIC - the gun also points while it spools damage to max. Disrupts with infinipoint to start with, and at 100% spool starts scramming too.
---
Consider we hold the world record at 6,142 concurrent players...
---
So it's a COSMOS site, that means it's in either:  
---
Aphi    
---
Chanoun    
---
Zimse   
---
Munory  
---
Or, unlikely, since you said 2 sites:  
---
Garisas  
---
Koona   
---
	
---
Lower PCU would also make sense in the higher-alt theory as well, as many multi-boxers probably have fewer alts online at a given time. Just waiting for content, etc. 
---
My popularity has never been higher.

How much are you going to give me to spend my personal time to test your system?
---
VA plate. Miss my college days in VA. 
---
they won't move ships with jumpdrives
---
Yes. The gamma abyssal weather effects are friendly to passive gilas. Same for exotics, and passive Gilas are the easiest ships to fly in abyss making these 2 expensive. So the filament costs cut into what you make because they will never drop enough of the particular filament type you want to run. You will have to suppliment and buy some, or sometimes a lot depending on your filament drop RNG. 
---
As far as the actual drops go. its mostly the same except mutaplasmids. Mutaplasmids types tend to be "concentrated" in each filament type, and some mutaplasmids are more expensive then others, thus on average provide more income. For example, neut mutaplasmids drop most often in electrical sites, you can get them in otehr sites too but relatively rare. Armor rep mutas in different filaments, shield rep mutas in different filaments, etc. etc.
---
What am I going to get to test their stuff for them? 
---
Cant tell if you are joking, but in wormholes, the small pvp corps that undock in hyperions or feroxs or whatever are way chiller and ‘cooler’ than turbo krabs that dock as soon as a new sig appears
---
Nullsec krab holes are fairly looked down upon
---
You do realize that when an MTU is scooped into a ship's cargo hold and moved, the cargo moves into the ship's cargo hold... right? And that loot can be dropped into a citadel without requiring the need to dock. And are you talking about green sites or red sites? I find it highly unlikely that there are 30+ combat sigs in one system, so I think you're talking about green sites and the estimated worth is going to be like 20m in junk mods.
---
How much are you going to give me to spend my personal time to test your system for you?

1. No because Tidi is local phenomenon i think

2. Buy it from market

2. Great! More shit to buy.

No.

hahahaha i LoL'ed at the office

Personally don't like evicting any live corps that aren't complete cancer. Wspace needs more content and you just made Wspace even more quiet.
---
Lmao I could read what you write for days. I am cute and bright-eyed tho :)
---
Will that ever happen?
---
I honestly wouldnt know, I quit. 
---
Honestly I figured out a long time ago if someone is going to rage at you for flying something (as long as it's not like an op with a doctrine), then they can fuck right off and you need to get as far from them as possible.
---
Always fly what you want when you're just having fun, fuck the killboards and fuck the tryhards.

Go try and jam a sieged dread. Lemme know how that works out for you.

A lot. If you haven’t spent 10 hours a week reading about the game for the last two months you’re going to be very, very lost

do you whore on evry killmail with big beard?

this was our last bubble.

Because you post like a retard and I beg you to stop. Everyone I've asked agrees with me.

Do a search for Skillshare.com promo code and you can find a 2 month trial. This is one of those teach a man to fish things since tbh spreadsheets are so fundamental to eve.

I’d also check out mogul stuff but your own spreadsheet will be much better suited especially for other things

Id say you need at least core, core missile, and capacitor skills at 5. You need HAC 5 for T5s, HAC4 for T4s just because of the Cerb's HAC bonuses. You can get away with some shield skills at 4 because you're trying to tank with your DPS.

I'll update this post tomorrow with my skills as I dont remember which support skills are at 4 and which are at 5.

I learned how to do everything in this video in under an hour and it was very frustrating because I have no idea how kendlive works. I just now it does work. The point of this video is to make fun of all the brainlet trash that grabs soap boxes and megaphones to complain about goons being on the CSM but can't be bothered to vote themselves. 
---
what if this ship auto cyno-jammed a system if it next to ore, so the only way it could get help is through black ops (expensive kills) or gating (long reaction time).
---
"but then people will use it as a cyno jammer".. an expensive one. is this bad?
---
also i really hope it doesn't have panic if this is the case
---
Rokh fleets next?

and just for some comparison, here is the interest graph for world of warcraft.

and the interest graph for WoW (not sure if it cares about capitalization or not, so this one may be skewed by the regular word)

Still, both of them show a DRAMATIC drop off... makes eves look pretty damn healthy by comparison actually.
---
Ehh TBH I thought it was more substantial than that.
---
Middle of afternoon for you = evening and early night for Europe and Asia.
---
And for a first stress test, why the hell would they pay for that kind of overtime? In future maybe, but you don’t throw more resources than you have to at something when you have no certainty it will work. You do a small test, then scale up.
---
How would your suggestion be any different then?

Alpha clone is free like normal medical care. Everyone has access to it and its a basic human right.

When I don't feel like completing the combat site.  I make warp to points about 200km off in a few directions.  Have the Drones aggress and move towards you.  Once they are far enough away from the cans, warp yourself to a can and hack it.  After done hacking, move to another 200km point you made and wait for the drones to re-aggress.  Repeat process until done.

Depends on how many players leave and how empty space becomes.

There will be rorquals forever though.

Being a great ceo means building a team to help you. The more the better so you can reposition when RL gets in the way.

No, because once combat probes are on the scan inhibitor they will also pick up your ship and the sig. Scan inhibitor only prevents d-scan

So you mean you are not looking forward to them?

What?
---
oh i see  but   that beard ship will grow bigger and bigger so it will not fit in your hangar! 
---
Costs the srp budget next to nothing, good for newbros/fulltime pvp pilots. (Some bizarro people actually can't afford 50m, and ~morenerdsinfleet~ is always the prime directive)
---
My hangar is large, it'll fit ;)
---
Who the fuck cares 
---
Don't know why you are being downvoted, since you are correct. To you people who think he is wrong. Rorqual mining: Do X get Y item. VNI: Do X get Y ISK. 
---
Rorqual mining is an isk sink since any action taken after getting Y item loses isk in the process, never creating ISK. VNI's however create isk.
---
Isk is abundant if you can be arsed to work for a living in a game. Not everyone can stand to play like that - it's why I quit Maplestory and OSRS! 
---
Just confirmed, this method works for bypassing 2FA Mismatch Error.
---
Id upvote you twice if i could, loggin into the test server after a year of that error is awesome.
---
Why are you adding the random guy in a freighter to test? it adds 10b to the losses. 
---
You know you can wardec people in highsec, right?
---
Well...that....esca... I'll my self out.
---
I am offended by your offendedness. Please stop being so offended. It's offensive.
---
Lol Jovian Lent.  
---
Why do you feel entitled to kill someone that is min-maxing safety?
---
What makes you think you'll get fights if people can't drop caps on you?
---
If they were going to give you a fight, they would have given you a fight and not dropped caps.
---
Because they put in effort to be safe?
---
I feel like the guy who warps into site and doesn't align deserves to die, but the guy putting in effort to stay safe shouldn't die unless you put in more effort to gank them (like blue eyes)
---
sticky dick would be lipkiy huy, not this
---
I don’t. I’m saying the instances a module like this would actually be effective is very limited unless people are reckless. That’s the idea if someone is content ratting with neuts in local they should actually be at risk.
---
There is: bring more shit. They have absolute firepower superiority over you, you aren't supposed to win.
---
Какие?
---
People who drop caps on you don't want you roaming through their space.
---
So yes, you shouldn't be able to roam because they make the rules since they have the biggest stick.
---
If nobody wants to give you a good fight, then it isn't the game mechanics that are the problem.
---
You are basically whining that nobody wants to play with you.
---
You can do it in a cheap probe or other exploration ship.  Make sure its fast and you can hack all the cans and get out before the NPC's spawn.  I recommend to fly cheap so if you lose the ship, no biggie. 
---
 fixed br 
---
no, you didn't
---
You’re only accounting for active isk making on a single account. 
---
I have an account that is plexed and nearly pays for itself just from extractors let alone the 4-5 billion a month it makes from industry. 
---
I have another account plexed again almost paid for by injectors alone that makes as much as I want it to by pulling and blitzing burner missions. About a billion for 1-2 hours of work per day or so. 
---
I also do importing. Extremely passive isk making that probably nets another billion a month. 
---
You can do the same thing with rorq alts when you have the skills trained. Each alt account is basically free. 
---
Injectors have fucked this game in so many ways. 
---
If you think Spaniards are anything like Latin Americans, you are the one with the narrow view. A middle class person in Latin America is making 5k US a year. So are you talking about 50 million Spaniards, or 350 million Latin Americans, because those two groups are nothing alike, except for their language.

Is solo wormhole ratting worth it as an alpha? Can I recoup ship expenses before I get jumped by a t3c gang?
---
The projection just never stops with you. Everything you accuse "goons" (really just anyone on reddit who mocks you) of is actually true of you.
---
Meh
---
Making big ISK that allows you to plex your accounts takes either a ton of SP, a ton of alts or a ton of time. And usually some combination of those. 
---
Alt accounts that only need a limited amount of training can be farmed for SP once they have everything trained and then the account essentially becomes free thanks to extractors and injectors. You can build up huge armies of alts over time by abusing that. That’s why fleets of rorq alts aren’t all that uncommon now a days. Even just 1 extra rorq alt and now you’re time spent mining is making you double what it did before. 
---
There are also a lot of semi passive ways to make isk. I do t2 and capital module industry. That makes me about 4-5 billion per month for about 30 minutes of logging in a day. Takes some alts, a lot of investment isk to do at a highly profitable level. 
---
I also do some importing to null sec of doctrine ships and that’s another billion or so a month for maybe 5 hours of work a month. The only thing you need for profits here is a large amount of investment capital so you can order in large shipments of ships and modules at a time. 
---
And lastly there are higher SP required active isk making methods like super carrier ratting, burner blitzing (not as much SP needed there), level 5 mission blitzing, wormhole dread and so on. These are the lot of time invested methods.

---
crab what ? in trig ships ? are you nuts ? you can do some PvE in them because its actually not mind numbing like in other shit. but they aren't exactly optimal for the task so crabbing in them doesn't work out longterm. and as far as getting them goes, beats the living fuck outta vni, super or rorq crabbing.
---
Imagine losing a AT ship to simple farmers.   
---
Ouch. 
---
&gt; No, because once combat probes are on the scan inhibitor they will also pick up your ship and the sig. Scan inhibitor only prevents d-scan 
---
This structure prevents the normal operation of directional scanners and probes within its 30km radius.

ya im just retarded ironically too
---
I'm all for a rework of the E-War drones, some of them are nearly useless / can't compete with a corresponding module because of stacking penalty. Also, you cripple your firepower if you use your drone bandwidth for utility instead of damage.
---
The reason ecm drones are more popular than every other e-war-drone is because they are the only ones that can "free" you from enemy tackle and are a "get-the-fuck-out"-tool. Especially in solo / small gang engagements. That won't change, even with a buff for the other drones.
---
Literally all of your numbers are straight wrong.
---
ISK printing and seeing internal drama. friends are still friends no matter the alliance they are part of, also its a lot of fun to see how small snips of info can cause issues.

In the middle of the dscan box there are 3 small buttons and one of them (I think the one that looks like a circle) enables you to see the dscan bubble on the system map.
---
See edit 2. As far as I'm aware your signature window is neither d-scan or a probe and the sig should still be visible and scannable as long as it's on your window.

May I interest you in this AWESOME pamphlet? It’s packed with a small dose of Jovian Miniaturized DD along with some internet salt.

Another balance issue that is not always seen is the raw stats of the drones. For instance, ec-300's have a base speed of 3200 m/s. sw-300, which you use to catch fast ships, only go 2400m/s base, meaning they are too slow to ever catch the fast ship you want to slow down anyways. All the other ewar drones are 3200 m/s base speed as well. 
---
what it does is it makes it so that whatever is within 30km of the inhibitor does not show on dscan or probe scan but it has a huge sig radius for being combat scanned itself.
---
It wont work for what op wants because even though it lands you on the entrance gate for complexes you are not within 30km once you take the first gate.
---
This is a good analysis but falls into 'Yea but we knew that.'
---
Evernus 
---
Idea 1: make the drone's effects more pronounced, more equal to the size of the module the drone is analogous to from a single drone. But have 100% stacking penalties, so one large web drone is 60% and adding a 2nd web drone has no effect.
---
Idea 2: make drone bonused hulls bonus the effects of ewar drones too.

---
My knee-jerk reaction is to tell you to HTFU, but really, if you're not willing to do even the slightest bit of research to find just about everything you just asked for (because spoiler: it exists and has been around) then you probably wont fit well into this game. Eve requires you to care enough to figure it out, and also to not take dying personally, which it appears you are. If you can't pick yourself up, dust yourself off and keep on trying, I highly doubt you will reach a point of enjoyment with this game.
---
That said, I understand where the feelings come from, as I experienced them myself when I first started, but now I love this game more than any game I ever have, and likely ever will, because I kept trying and kept learning.
---
Oh, and, something something it's a sandbox, the tools are there, figure it out etc etc.

the evf killboard just pulls all kills from a system during a set period

you can't not include random shit like that, which makes any br from a fight happening in empire very likely to include unrelated shit happening elsewhere in system
---
What I would give to see this. Sounds awesome even as someone outside the blob.
---
Yeah but you can put it on a different team lol
---
10k+ entity "physics" simulations are no joke computationally even for loose usages of the term, especially given the number of drones or fighters most large fights tend to field.
---
On top of the computation you have an input/output problem. Each action needs to be seen by every other entity in the simulation over public internet. 10k players in a fight, each making a single action or state change per tick means a hundred milllion pieces of data need to be distributed. If each of those is a single byte and there's no network overhead, that's 100MB of data *per second*. Most of these things are going to be integers, which quadruple the delivery size, plus all the network overhead, the fact that each entity is almost certainly emitting more than one piece of data (at the very least we get position and velocity, which is another 6x multiplier) and you're looking at something that would make most software people sweat at least a little.
---
I think there's room to improve some ew drones, but you also have to consider they're may be tech II versions down the road. I think they are fine right now. You don't want them too strong, because theoretically you could combine 5 different ew drone types and it would be pretty op. 
---
that kb is so buggy I'm willing to give homeboy the benefit of the doubt
---
you can meticulously organize everyone onto proper teams and put third parties in their own column all you want, if zkill pushes a new kill once you post that link it reshuffles all of the parties back to whatever column it wants
---
I think you're right, there was post about this a few weeks back saying the same thing
---
But will it be in 2019 graphics or 2010 graphics
---
People constantly complain about rorqs, proliferation of supers and titans, the ease of replacing them. But bigger and better mining is a big cause of these things.
---
Rorq was CCPs response to industrialists wanting a capital end game, a reason to keep gaining skills. But we aren't seeing mineral usage rise to match the one being mined. A mining Titan would just make this issue so much worse.
---
People can talk about isk faucets and sinks all day, but mineral faucets are out of control.
---
I dont have a solution for industrialists. Essentially you have constant gains and progressions. So long as you mine more than the material amount of your ship, you'll never be moving backwards in the game.
---
at some point you should stop doing edits and understand that you have absolutely no idea what you are talking about...... :)
---
Adapt or die would be the way forward I think. It'll require a different type of FC, but they'll be made
---
You bet me to it. 
---
Who says there only needs to be two sides? You could have 30 sides with that, and you'd almost have to if you're fighting in real time with current FC playstyles.
---
What project are you referring to?

so we divide a normal delve fleet into 3-4 smaller ones, of only 10k right? Sounds cool, i have a corpie who can take on this alone. let me make a phone call.. \^\_\^

---
I learned a lot from this post. 
---
I'd love to see sw drones buffed so I'm not completely ass fucked by a kitey garmur in literally any ship because I failed to catch them in the .02 second reaction period when they land in a FW plex and then burn away at 5km/s and hold point at 40k
---
Is this going to play like EvE or like Valykyrie?
---
o7 
---
Because if you aren't paying me, I have little reason to join that fleet you just pinged for.
---
I genuinely have better things to do with my time.
---
Same here
---
Eve needs to figure out how to make fleet battles about multiple front of smaller fleets. Like cap a section of space at 10 per fleet and make it so you have to hold multiple fronts for some big times reward 
---
Don't encourage this, it's destructive for his sanity.
---
Combination of fatigue amongst the couple of major supercap FCs and NIPs combined to give us a fairly peaceful past 6 months.  Look at the month period in august/september - about 100 titans were killed.
---
Also lack of a "goal" has been part of why no major invasion has occurred.   The major parties don't feel pressed to expand.
---
Its good stuff but the thing is, when I started back in Incarna, it was basically 'Don't use EWAR drones outside of ECM drones.'
---
You can do whatever you want lol.
---
I don't think it is a good idea to try and roam around in space which people don't want you roaming around in unless you are equipped to fight them.
---
Eve online, a graphics mod for Google Spreadsheet.
---
Below is a screenshot of my current spreadsheet (using Evepraisal's API to continuously update prices). As you can see, at the cheapest ISK per SP with the Basic 'Ardour' Cerebral Accelerator, you're still paying 57.24% more per SP. It is worth saving up to get the actual Skill Injectors because: 
---
1. They don't expire.
---
2. Immediate SP to use
---
3. Much higher volume of purchases meaning its much easier to sell if you need liquidity
---
Some notes:
---
*No sales note on Advanced and Extended. There seems to be no sales of these two on Evepraisal's databse currently. This could be wrong, or they could be in contracts.
---
*I used the 400,000 SP per Skill Injector because it's the 5m - 50m SP that my toon falls into. Plus it feels like the 'average' of what most will get from it

I've always held a bit of a grudge against BTLH from an attempted eviction (we kicked their teeth in) and while my opinion of inner hell has been somewhat soiled by the hivemind, this post gives me great joy.
---
Well done
---
Also, you cannot assist those drones to a drone bunny like you can DPS ones.
---
A BTLH eviction would be justified by default tbh
---
I guess I'm part of a new flock of players that barely knew they existed outside of the ECM ones 
---
So what you're saying is that it was written by a Democrat posing as a ruski?
---
This. Eve online mirrors the real world way too much in allowing the top to recursively exploit their advantages. 
---
Maybe. Depends. If you have the SP to fly a decent Rattlesnake, you could probably make some 200m/hr, and theoretically up to 1b per hour running high class site escalations as part of a group. Look up fits for Tinker Rattlesnakes and see if you can fly that. Alternatively, look up C3 Rattlesnakes. There are other ships you can run C3 sites in, like a Gila, but I’m not sure if newbies have enough sp. 
---
If you’re smart, you will never get caught running WH sites, but that typucally involves having scouts that may be outside your capabilities. Additionally, the time to getting killed running WH sites is extremely hard to predict. You may get caught running your first site, you may never have somebody in the system for weeks.

Corps would have to invent new techniques to manage the huge fights.
---
Seems like a nice challenge
---
Yeah if a hunter puts in more effort than a group that is keeping a region safe they absolutely deserve the kill.
---
If you want to beat the guy doing everything right, you should to have to put in an extraordinary amount of effort into the kill.
---
I'll give you an example that happened to me:
---
I was rorqual mining in the ass-end of nowhere with no super umbrella and help pretty far away. I put a lot of effort into being safe with eyes on every gate 4 jumps out, eyes on the regional close to me, bubbles up on the pipe to my dead end(5 sets of 100km bubbles), and a pretty decently active intel channel.
---
Any time a roaming gang came through, I was de-sieged, docked up, and logged off before they could even get a look.
---
The one time I actually got ganked, the attacker put a lot more effort into the gank than I did with defense. They set up 10 fucking sabres on the other side of a regional then all jumped in at the same time and burned straight at my system. They proceeded to bubble me, drop 3 supers on me, and kill half of my rorqs. They came prepared, with a plan, and executed it very well and they were able to kill me because they put in a ton of effort.
---
Sorry for the wall of text but that is an example of what a good balance between effort defending vs effort attacking.
---
So essentially anywhere? And by equipped to fight them, I assume you’re meaning either a full super fleet with sub cap support fleets or hundreds of dreads? Cause there isn’t anything else that is going to contest the standing fleets
---
Their designed for caps so their capital guns.
---
That's the point of this post, so we can make them viable. 
---
The problem is that say, on the Frigate level, things like the Tristan rely on them primarily for damage, and once you get Good Drone Skills, having an extra 150-200dps is nuts, especially when someone's tank is measured sub 10k hp. 
---
Get out of Fail Free ECM drones are a helluva thing but I don't think there's much we can do on the Drone front. 
---
Implying that anyone votes for nullsec alliance candidates except that alliance/coalition's members.  
---
Which is enough tbh.
---
this.
---
isk is easier than ever to make, and i have more stuff than ever before to do that doesn't involve playing eve.
---
i don't think my net wealth in eve has gone up for a couple of years now - just been at break even because i have other priorities.
---
It might be a setback. For years botting app Honorbuddy   for WoW ran only under 32bit client. So if anything it will result in at least temporary hiccup before the bots adjust. I'm guessing the drop in productivity across Eve will be obvious  when 64bit client and 32bit won't be usable anymore.
---
Honestly we all are stupid for playing still more so since the sale of ccp. Anyways the biggest issue is that sub cap fleets use to be viable vs some dreads now drop them and a few haw dreads and your set from any small group more so if you space the haw out around the other dread which gives you very good coverage against smaller groups when it comes to ranges. Sure in  massive fleet fights it matters less but drop a few dreads on a small group and dont bunch them up and you will likely kill them outright or at the least force them out. I liked when caps required at the least a sub cap support fleet as people are just to damn cap happy.
---
I mean yeah if the whole game doesn't want to play with you or give you good fights you are pretty much sol.
---
That is patently false, but yeah in that hypothetical if you've earned the ire of everyone in eve, then there are consequences to your actions.
---
I remember a Corp mate auotpiloting a hic in a circle in our region and then minimizing the client. When his shield alarm went off he would tab back, point whatever it was with the stupidly long point (since nerfed) and light the cyno. The only question was who would get on the kill (activate nsa and fire) before the ship blew up. Was funny for a time but horribly broken game play.
---
How else will the krabs know they're only doing rock havens for dank ticks?
---
The point of using the Astero over the Stratios that /u/Abaddon866 was trying to make, is that the Astero is:
---
1. 1 Stratios is worth about 3 asteros
---
2. Faster align time
---
3. Faster warp and sub-warp speeds
---
4. Stratios and Astero have the same hacking bonuses (37.5 probe strength and 10 bonus virus strength)
---
Your best bet for Data and Relic sites is to get in, do them, get out.  Drop off your loot once you feel you have enough to make it not worth continuing with that much in your cargo.
---
As much as I love the Stratios, it makes for a poor data/relic running ship. It also makes for a much more 'juicy' kill, and is more likely to get ganked because of this.
---
Save your Stratios for running missions, or for when you're in sov space that you trust. You really don't even need an Astero. Using a Magnate if you can't use Covert Ops ships (Buzzard, Anathema, Cheetah, Helios) is great because of the 4 low slots you can use 4 warp core stabilizers. It'll decrease your scan resolution and targeting distance, but it means that it's going to take more than 2 scrams (non faction) to get you. I definitely recommend training into the Covert Ops. It's truly worth it. 
---
Karkur is still fighting the good fight.
---
Oh shit I forgot, please don't USS Liberty me
---
Fax are newer and did fix the size issue some. But their still two small. Undock a thanatos and a hyperiond or even a myrmadon for example I can fit almost 2 hyperions or a few mryms in it yet both ships are almost the same damn size as the carrier.
---
The far left one. It looks. Like a crab.
---
&gt; But have 100% stacking penalties, so one large web drone is 60% and adding a 2nd web drone has no effect.
---
But then you'd just run a rainbow flight of ewar drones, and practically get every ewar effect as a trade for your drone slots.
---
Now if all 5 together after stacking penalties are applied comes out to being equivalent to (let's say) 75% effectiveness of a t2 module, then maybe itd be a start.
---
At least buying plex will be a really good deal
---
No worries, when I do nobody will remember or care

Yea, especially for everyone running like 6-10 accounts .... LOL

It wasn't, anymore than dropping a nuke on Japan was a severe showing of military capabilities. You guys went singinifcantly over the top because you didn't want a fight, you wanted a guarantee. You threw every person you could at it, pulled goons in to cover you, and then flexed as though it was a a strategic masterpiece.
---
No one believes hk getting evicted isn't a big deal. It did mean something. But you ruined any chance of that being attributed to you or your groups intelligence and instead continued to perpetuate that initiative in fact cannot act independently, and fears any chance of loss.
---
"Before we did it, had anybody ever evicted anybody with a 700+ man fleet? No"
---
That's the point dumbass. No one had ever tried, and due to provable concerns of losing, you guys bought in literally every ounce you could muster of your strength lmao.
---
Like I said, no one outside of your autistic echo chamber is falling for this. In fact almost every time you respond prove the point of the opposing side, which is that you're just trying to look good for your f1 monkeys lmao. 
---
Thats a fantastic anecdote but it doesnt prove or disprove the capital meta or how the game is balanced towards Farms and Fields...which is and always will be the argument.
---
In my original statement, I was mocking the usual krab response of "oh they just want free and easy kills" with an equally dumb "oh they just want free and easy farming"
---
There needs to be a balance between farming and hunting, mechanically, and unfortunately its far too on the side of farmers than it is hunters.  Its got nothing to do with how protected your space is or how many nerds can materialize from 250 units of LO. It's got everything to do with instantly respawning anomalies, homogenized space to where truesec doesnt matter, rorquals effectively being structures with a 7 minute rf timer, and carriers/supercarriers being swiss army knives.
---
EVE is a video game with a player-made economy. Tilt too much one way and you get massive isk inflation and an overabundance of cheap ore, and suddenly the risk from losing stuff is gone, which is the video game's main drawing point. Likewise, tilt the other way and you get massive isk deflation and really expensive ore to where people are afraid to undock because replacement cost is too expensive.
---
Either way, the game needs a massive balance overhaul. Not just modifying some ship integer values but a whole relook on a lot of fundamental aspects of the game.
---
wut?

The timer starts the moment you press "warp to" unless of course you are cloaked. If you are not running covops conventional wisdom is to warp to a celestial near the site and to warp in from there.

I started playing in 2004 with a rl friend. He created his own corp, but the name he wanted was already taken. I told him to add 2004 as a suffix.

I've been on a break for 8 years due to having family and job etc, but in the last 6 months I've spent about £1,000 on a computer setup and currently have 6 accounts!
---
So to answer your question, hopefully forever. 
---
Over production, or not enough demand for the items that cost less than the cost to make them.  I have personally made isk producing T2 Blueprints and Items, and am starting to make T3 BP's and items.  The key for me is harvesting all the resources myself (which is time consuming) and selling the items I make in high profit markets.  You need to study the market and find where you can make that profit.  Join an Indy corp for help.  
---
There's no mechanical need to expand, and "content deployments" against any major entity boil down to Stuka fleets trying to kill krabs since anything else is hit with overwhelming supercapital force.
---
Wars are fought on reddit more than in the client, and unironically highsec has more potential for subcapital content now.
---
I disagree with the nullsec assesment. A lot of people are running Nullsec sites so the "good" areas (stain, venal) tend to be picked clean in my experience. J-space however has some 2500 systems and there are plenty in there that are just dead empty and full of untouched sites. By checking your d-scanner you can get a ptretty decent idea of who is in the area.
---
Maybe it's just luck on my part or my own stupidity but I have died waaay more roaming nullsec than in J-space. YMMV though, find out what works for you.
---
Then do it!
---
What about running lower class sites in something like a caracal, myrmidon, or drake? Will low level holes have more traffic? Will the more engageable ships get ganked more frequently?
---
&gt; The reason ecm drones are more popular than every other e-war-drone is
---
is because ec-300s are the only light ewar drone that makes a noticeable impact
---
lots of fleet doctrines have 25m3 drone bays and 50 dps from a flight of t2 light drones that may or may not get smartbombed for a 50% jam chance on a hostile logi is a trade i'll take every time
---
meanwhile the only time i've ever seen painter drones used in pvp is on a solo/smallgang torp raven, which stopped being popular about 10 years ago
---
Yet another balance issue. I upvoted, its valid and with a good summary.
---
my point was they is no limitation
---
Do you think that drone damage bonuses should improve ewar drones as well, in order to make the damage sacrifice worth it? As it stands it seems odd that the dedicated drone platforms are the worst to use ewar drones with.
---
Or we could just nerf the garmur.
---
Man that just makes it worse. Now HK was beaten by retards.
---
If a full flight of drones is only 75% of the effectiveness of a single T2 module, there's virtually no reason to ever use them.
---
angel titan is literally big krab and thus more aesthetic than trig ships
---
It all depends. C1 sites can be run in basically anything, Wolf rayets can be run in Frigates, a Pulsar will kill anything armor tanked. Read up on WH effects. Stick to battlecruiser or above. Both a Myrm and a Drake should be fine for C3 sites if you’re well fit, but search for Karr’s Modified Rykki’s guide for more site information. You may be able to clear some sites in your fit, but not all.

Some holes do have more traffic, but it all depends. A wormhole that you found 1 jump away from Jita is going to have a lot more traffic than a wormhole that you found scanning in Fountain or something. Engageable happens to be a relative term, and most wormhole groups operate under the principle of warp tackle over first, worry about what it is second so it doesn’t really matter what you’re flying if hostile are aggressive enough. An MJD does offer a good escape mechanism, but it’s not a guarantee and it may not be worth taking up a slot for if you’re trying to make a cheap fit

you know.. a server wide "pos invasion" by drifters would be a cool phase out for the pos system, make drifters blow em up and thats why they are gone

Came here to say this, leaving sad and empty handed, but happy cake day and have an upvote.

That's easy maths, a siege cycle length.
---
but i want neither at my door... but those people who wanna talk about trees wont DD my appartment when i say no hopefully
---
My ratting ships would look like a carny after a tattoo convention.
---
that could work too, but it needs low dps to not be completely broken 
---
&gt; A mining Titan would just make this issue so much worse.  
---
just make it expensive as hell to build and run, faction titan level bpc price etc.. 
---
American here so I'd kill to be your version of an alpha clone :(
---
And you won't see the attacker taking the gate.
---
Would you care to... Venture a guess?
---
Plus it’s retarded that Sansha’s implants, faction or dead space modules are for armor
---
I mean, they use shields goddamnit
---
It's pretty tough, only items that require high skills make profit and even those make little of it, plus you have to sell them and get outbid by market bots.
---
Too bad they messed up with Caroline's star, everyone was able to see the supernova at the time of it happening all across new eden. So ccp has confirmed that light also travels faster than light in the submarine simulator.

Bjorn solo meme and fun capital pvp obviously. I like the story and awesomeness of coalition warfare but fights with massive amounts of tidi and fighters on grid makes me sick.
---
Virginia. What do I win?
---
If that were true, the guy would be a gay niegro...
---
wouldn't that be the Angel BS, since the minnie rats are angels? there's concept art for that, seems like a bigger project
---
So basically Hilmar promised some guys 10k free testers for a completely unrelated project and all he had to do was to stick a cheap Eve sticker onto it?
---
I've played Eve from a cabin in the woods a good hour drive from civilization. It's actually a decent game to play on satellite internet due to relatively low bandwidth needs compared to others.
---
I would love to see ships that get dedicated ewar-only drone bays. One of the biggest tradeoffs besides being weak is the question "why use them when I can get more dps?"
---
If you give players restricted drone bays on certain ships, I guarantee they will start to see more use even in limited capacity.
---
For example, when the Zealot was granted a drone bay fairly recently, it could have been given an ewar-drone-only bay and been much more interesting.
---
That all said, it is also odd that droneboat platforms like the Vexor will *never* use them because they get the vast majority of their damage from drones. I'm not necessarily advocating for a rebalance, but there is potential for discussion on the merits.
---
Eve died a decade ago. Today we feast upon and desecrate it's rotten, delicious corpse.
---
oh no! In future send a message to Eve-Scout, they can help you with new probes or a way out.
---
medium autocannons
---
All can be useful, depends if you play solo or fleets and if fleets, what fleets then (what are your doctrines if you have any). 
---
But i would advise starting with frig weapons (small, cheap stuff you can fly and lose) and slowly climbing up. 
---
So legacy should win eve since they have like 20 alliances?
---
lets not be hasty
---
Depends on what you're shooting, range, tracking, and ammo.  Pretty much everything is useful in situations. Missiles and drones are the most used and versatile. They're the easiest to master. However... hybrids, lasers, and projectiles all do great things. Artilleries have huge alpha damage, while other types will get you higher dps. 
---
No easy answer... Depends what you like. 
---
Thats how ferox fights are
---
It seems every time I train the current meta it gets nerfed. Year training for nano, nerfed. Time training for t3s nerfed . Heavy missiles. Nerfed. 
---
Because they can be made outside highsec for far less than you think.
---
No
---
Yeah, anyone who’s ever been through catch should know that simple farmers runs gatecamps pretty much 24/7, and they also run pretty good ones. 
---
The least you could do was bring a travel fit + mobile depot, but I guess this guy was just really dumb 
---
For PvE purposes drones and missiles are most common. For the gunnery skills it really depends on what ships you want to fly. Which race you like. All weaponskills are usefull and have their strenghts and weaknesses 
---
They have to undock first.
---
Mm I can see the logic behind that though, making the web drones too fast would really hurt fast ships, too many ships can run a couple light drones. [Webs, webs everywhere](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/mobile/000/002/868/XXEverywhere.jpg)
---
Here are a few guidelines regarding to understry :  
---
\-The lower the skill investment is, the lower is the margin on the market. Frigates and such will do less than 2% margin when you count taxes if you simply do "buy orders/ sell orders" runs and are generally hard to qualify worthwhile  
---
\-You have to assume "opponents" run a full rigged raitaru/ engineering complex for their production with reductions of costs, time, or both at the same time. To get a rough estimation of what a realistic price of construction would be, check [https://eve-industry.org/calc/](https://eve-industry.org/calc/)  
---
This is particularly true when you enter low-margin territory where in apparence, there are only a few percents of value of the base item  
---
\-advanced items should be constructed from the barebones, do \*not\* buy components but build them as they often consist most of the margin (especially on my market)  
---
\-When you check an item where you think margin is low, check what shares its components, sometimes, when you want to build a oneiros it's just not worth it because someone bought all the parts for an ishtar batch. Waiting for good market opportunities help on the long run  
---
\-Sometimes, you can't win a market because the opposition just mines its base materials or gets them at a way better rate than what you can have. it's a way of things you can't really control.  
---
I wish you good luck
---
Unfortunately it has been abandoned by the developer for quite some time :/ in its current state it doesn't really work all too well, especially if you're trading out of citadels. Still worth trying though, as I've had very random results attempting to getting it to function properly.
---
the thing is tho, the web drones are based on the warrior, the fastest drone in the game at 5000m/s base ... why would it NOT go fast? 
---
Fuck bob!          
---
There is only one Lord and Savior! Sansha Kuvakei! 
---
The effect if the SW-300 drines is so weak it doesn’t really matter if they catch you. They barely nerf your speed even if all 5web you.
---
&gt; This is a good analysis but unfortunately falls into 'Yea but we knew that.'

Since when rorq can warp in industry mode?

An SRP Reviewers opinion?
---
To make us question why we volunteered to do this role.....

You'd think minmatar drones would be the fastest
---
That's not an accident. The meta becomes stale when everybody can fly it, and changes. Kind of like how a fashion trend will die off the moment Walmart starts carrying it. Or like how Facebook became uncool when your mom started using it.
---
Eve is a fairly specific game, you pick what you want to do, and then train into that.   
---
So as a blanket answer to your question, no.
---
But once you specify what you want to do with your time in game, you can then focus your training que.   
---
*Get out*
---
Grr Socialism
---
Because you're sourcing overpriced inputs, and/or don't have access to the best possible production bonuses.
---
I miss the Chronicles.
---
Honestly I think it will depend a lot on how the transition to the aether architecture goes (if it ends up happening)  
---
The current architecture has effectively hit its limits, had those limits expanded multiple times, and is now reaching critical end of life state.   
---
If nothing major gets changed with the underlying code, and if they can't switch over to a more modern engine, then eve has maybe another 5 or so years worth of life left in it. how much of that will be life support mode is yet to be seen. (and heavily dictated by how ccp/pa handles the game and its community.)  
---
if the aether thing works well though, I could see that easily allowing the game to stretch out for another 10 years, at roughly the same population it has now (while its currently far less than its peak, it has remained relatively stable for the past few years.)   
---
in order to start growing again, that is actually completely out of ccp's hands. the gaming market right now is REALLY not friendly towards mmo's (at least outside of korea) even WoW is currently sitting at less than 10% of its peak population, and almost every new mmo that has come out in the past 5 years or so has died almost instantly.  
---
That trend will only reverse in time, and probably require a new generation of gamers (trends tend to go in cycles, and those cycles tend to be based around what types of genres are lacking when a new generation starts getting into gaming, or as a previous generation starts getting nostalgic)   
---
if we can hold on for those 10 years though, its possible we might see another revival of mmo popularity, and if that happens, with how much history eve has behind it, and a more modern engine. It could conceivably continue on far longer.  
---
As for hemorraging players, I'm not actually sure its nearly as bad as people seem to think, as I mentioned before, WoW is sitting at around 10% of its peak player base, most other mmo's the same age as eve are doing even worse. even more modern ones are either completely shut down, or doing even worse than WoW.  
---
Meanwhile eve is hovering right around 40% of our peak, which means when it comes to actual retention we are doing better than pretty well any other mmo out there.  
---
Frankly though, i'm not sure how much it matters in the long run, even if eve where to shut down tomorrow its had an absolutely unprecidented run, especially for such a niche game.  
---
There are kids who where born while it was in early development who are now old enough to drink, hell there are probably players out there right now who hadn't even been born yet when the game was released.  
---
If it lasts another week, or another 20 years, I for one am still glad to have been a part of it for as long as I have been, and plan to continue enjoying it through its ups and downs for however long it has left.
---
I am more interested in answer to the questions bolow: 
---
Why the do you even care? Is it your money? No. Then why the fuck???
---
Don't worry, a few years in and you'll be like me.
---
I have almost every subcap ship and weapon type to V. Just currently finishing a few weapon specs to V.
---
I'm sure blops V will come in handy one day.... maybe.
---
Ccp thought the same about Titans and thought that they'd always be rare.
---
&gt; Also why do so many items cost less that the resources they are produced from?
---
There are many sensible reasons, plus several stupid ones.
---
I won't get into the details, but just rest assured there are lots of profitable items.
---
Tips:
---
* Avoid ships.  Everybody thinks building ships is cool.  Your grandmother would build ships if she played Eve.  Few consider, or care about the profitability.  The ship market is largely a disaster-area.
---
* Avoid low trade volume items.  If you can't sellout a production run in less than 3 days without changing the price, the item sucks.
---
* Avoid items that have low replacement rate.  When a ship is destroyed, there is the loss of one hull, but many more modules, and ammo.
---
* Consider items you yourself use a lot.
---
* Consider items that nearly everybody in Eve uses at some time.
---
* Don't overlook T1 items.  Many industrialists without imagination do, and there are a lot of T1 items that constantly sell well.  Example:  I was selling over 1b a month of just one T1 item.
---
I'm an industrialist, and I'm probably worth several hundred billion.  I lost track.
---
Do you play sometimes, or just read this sub? :)
---
yea but that was 10+ years ago, thats a decade... wich is like 1000 years in a videogame life, lots of time to amass these behemoths 
---
\~elit\~ monentary losses
---
why don't soldiers pay for the weapons and vehicles they use lmao
---
'Massacre'
---
&gt; Many of the bittervets who have that 20bn who die on a T1 fleet won't waste their time submitting the SRP request anyway.
---
Vets would be ashamed of it. And possibly ridiculed on comms as well. :D
---
Thousand times over. :)
---
MS Excel + taking meticulous records of every trade.
---
There is also the fact that the EWAR drones as a group are immensely more squishy than even the T1 combat drones, let alone the faction or T2 variants. Which is another thing against them because while one or two slots of EWAR may be less effective... it lasts as long as your ship does at immensely longer ranges.
---
Which again means combat drones are massively preferred except in the situation where you want to GTFO. Where the EC drones are a roll of the dice at getting away. Or on fleet comps where you just have mass ECs to fuck with enemy logistics.
---
If there were some EWAR drone only bays on ships with \*significant\* HP bonuses to the drones so they don't instantly pop when looked at though might make things more interesting.
---

It is rorquals and bombers online atm.
---
‘Minerals I mined myself are free’ right? Well no they arn’t.   
---
Basically all what you do ends up as isk/hr.    
---
Lets take a ship and mats for it as example (numbers for convinience and are not real). A condor, bpc and some mats for it, production time is 1 hr.  Setting up buy orders shows you you need to spend 105k isk on mats plus 5k installation fee. Condor costs 110k after market fees so you wont make any profit buying mats and making it. If you mine mats for a condor and sell them, you can make 100k isk in less than an hour. If you prod the condor yourself and sell it for 110k isk you earned less isk/hr because you spent more time on that , you have spent isk on fees and taxes and so on.   
---
Basically speaking you make way less isk/hr than you could have on a low margin items. 
---
Well Sansha was initially armor race.

Sansha drops armor modules as base drops.

Faction stuff is also armor and relic sites offer intact armor plates as T2 salvage.

We cant give you the answer you are looking for. I can give you a priority list tho. Don't forget eventually you have to train it all.
---
Projectiles, Hybrids, Missiles, Lasers
---
Oh no "everyone I've asked", well gosh that convinces me.
---
The question still stands: who are you that I should give a shit?
---
yeah no shit. should have thought someone was going to point that one out like it's the same thing. it isn't. why not have one per ship, so you can laugh at krabs who only have one side of their super painted. that would even satisfy the leet pvpers on this subreddit
---
Careful, or they'll spend weeks posting angrily about how much they don't care at you too.
---
&gt;why do we need a special dance and song, we re the baddies, remember? 
---
quick question, are the "stock prices" actually real figures for mineral and asset prices or are they just {CCP_Round(RNG)}
---
More rorqs with cores in them die per engagement than excavator pack dies.
---
Given the pilots are not completely retarded, they would save up their drones in a Wetu and just lose 3-4 B rorq with core and mods on it, when they see they will be engaged and lose the ship.
---
good to see you making videos again chols
---
start small and work your way up, you can train up basic proficiency in every small weapon type in a week or so, could probably hit t2 with every small in a month, and no matter how long you've been playing, you will always find yourself back in frigs and destroyers from time to time. (bigger isn't always better) 
---
From there, figure out what you want to do, drones are generally a good choice for anyone though, not only are they one of the most popular weapons types to use for pve (on ships that are bonused for them) but nearly every ship cruiser sized and above (and a decent number of frigs and dessies as well) has some form of drone bay, so it will have at least some use in just about any ship.  
---
as for ones you might not want to bother with. defender missiles are rather niche, although depending on what alliance you join up with, they can find a use (and having it trained puts you in a specialist role, which can be fun)  
---
medium auto-cannons are currently hot garbage, so you might want to skip that, although medium artillery can be decent, and if you are training for the artillery it takes very little time to train the t2 autocannons as well, so you might want to do it "just in case" they ever get around to fixing them.  
---
actually, projectiles in general aside for large artillery aren't in a great spot right now. so if you where looking for an entire branch to hold off on, you could probably skip them entirely and not be missing all that much.  
---
Lasers and hybrid weapons are probably the 2 most popular weapons systems for pvp right now, especially in larger fights. although I would give the edge slightly to hybrids since (at least in my experience) they seem to be getting slightly more use, and they are used by both gallente and caldari ships, while lasers are exclusively amarr.   
---
if you focus your training towards missiles, hybrids, and drones that should give you a pretty good spread for most circumstances, will work well with any gallente or caldari ship (minmatar and amarr both have some missile boats as well) and by training both gallente and caldari you get access to the gila and the rattlesnake, both ships being the current kings of pve.
---
\&gt; doing this kind of stuff put also significant load on the server and on clients that need to catch up with this.
---
Not really. Chat was never a huge drag on server performance and has been less so since the changes last year. Also, eve has never been supported on starch-based platforms so no point in testing that threshold.
---
10 months unless drastic warfare and ship balance change happens. Or that thingy they are trying with the new cloud technology. Players online are ridiculously low for this time of the year. The camp choke points are very inactive which tells you something...
---
I hope it does not die activity wise before CCP manage to migrate the game to that tech, given it works at all.
---
Medium and large autocannons. Likely smalls too but I cannot speak to that since I don't fly frigates with guns. 
---
Ewar-only drone bays sounds like an interesting idea, but I have mixed feelings about the community's reaction to that.
---
I think a good compromise would be to give Ship Trait bonuses to some ewar drones, in addition to making the drones more even in value. I imagine, for example, that the Dragoon could get +10% to energy neutralized with Acolyte EV-300's per level in Amarr Destroyer.
---
Thanks for the reply, this is the type of answer I was looking for, I’m mostly trying to focus on pvp..
---
looking at those Praetor EV-900's i'm actually kinda shocked, they actually seem half decent. unless there is something major that i'm missing, they seem to neut out nearly as much as a t2 large, but without draining your own cap in the process.  
---
The ogre sensor dampers and preator tracking disruptors also seem like they could be potentially useful. considerably stronger than the module, and given how rarely they are used I could see them managing to seriously fuck up someones tracking/targeting, at least long enough to make the difference .
---
I was looking forward to focusing mostly on pvp 
---
The whole Caroline star thing was poorly made. They didnt even name it, they took a name from a player.
---
And no follow up...
---
Goons worried about escalations. luls
---
You evicted HK? You should of said something, something as historic as that should be publicized and we should be reminded about atleast once a month.
---
Potato looks the same in 2010 as it does in 2019. And big stuff is allways in potato.
---
Thanks for all the advice. Been trying tiers 1-3 so far and am enjoying them. Need a bit more practice at t3 just to get target priority down and shave off some time before trying t4. I really like that its engaging rather than just orbit, launch drones complete.
---
Thanks a lot for the information, I think this gives me the exact idea. Also I prefer the Gallente and Caldari ships so this is perfect advice for me..
---
True, but the problem is that only the heavy drones are somewhat good, which means its mostly for battleships anyway. People usually use T2 heavy damage drones or sentries for battleships, since the extra dps still is probably more useful in a fleet fight.
---
For smaller engagements you will probably still use smaller damage drones, to clear off tackle for example.
---
You would be very hard-pressed to get people to fit ewar drones if they can still use dps drones in their place. Very few fits will ever prioritize them.
---
Here we go again - lol
---
anyone who has the time available and - dare I say it -ENJOYS harvest resourcing can seriously undercut any hardcore industrial / trader who buys mats from the market.
---
If time is not an issue, and the playstyle is enjoyed then its not a problem as his materials are essentially free.
---
..but of course the hardcore industrial/trader doesnt have that time OR enjoyment maybe from harvesting so for him TIME IS MONEY.
---
Its all about playstyle - and no-one likes being undercut ;)
---
I thought maybe give the drones to support ships and have drone bonuses for them, but than I realised it would probably be OP af since you could just spam support frigs that have both bonuses to their race ewar + drones... Sooo maybe tailor them to be used by the logistics?
---
You don’t emphasise enough the main reason of the disparity though: ec drones are largely as shit as the rest per se but they are not stacking penalised. Imo ec drones are dumb, putting the outcome of a fight into rng is dumb and you shouldn’t take them as a basis for comparison. No stacking penalty also means that they are easily usable in fleets contrary to the others. To be quite fair I think drones are in a bad spot in the game in general and thus buffing other ewar drones will be a mistake. Nowadays ccp puts a flight of drones on every single fucking ship. You find the zealot slow and lacking pg ? Here, have a drone bay. So instead on working on making ships specialised you just add generic low dps/low utility with very solid application that blurs the lines. The dynamic involved around drones is really bad. The concept around their application, speed and hp is really flawed. Pretty much all tournaments that used to be out there flat out ban t2 drones in general and often ecs because of it. The interesting thing is in eve-nt as ecs and t2 drones were banned you would see an ewar drone meta emerge where people would sometimes use td drones to tune down strong enemy long range bs and bcs. Some also used web drones to catch kiting battleships or prevent yourself from being caught. This was only possible because it was in a tournament setting where you knew the comps and fits in advance but wouldn’t make any sense on tq. To be quite honest I think drones need a very solid rework in the game to stop them for being so flexible and sharpen the edges. Meanwhile I’d rather not have strong ewar drones that would transform any ship out there in a usable ewar platform.
---
Also you can spam the enemy logi wing with them in fleet fights... You don't really need other e-war drones, since there will always be like vigils, mauluses in fleets, as well as proper T2 cruiser support.
---
no one can say anything because it doesnt exist yet
---
In case of 'having fun gathering' yes, its whole other deal.
---
I just posted it in case of usual thing as 'minerals I mined are free'.
---
If you find market bots a problem, then that item likely has too low of a trade volume to bother with.
---
Example of a bot-infested market:  minerals, especially tritanium.  Despite that, it is really easy to sell and buy minerals at your chose price, because the trade volume is enormous.
---
because its 2019, no one do pve anymore.... just some bots
---
please train for a rorqual
---
It won't. In the future if you spam local CCP Guard will come back and slap you with a herring. 
---
Ooh, is SC getting totally original new buildings?
---
Or the opposite and people will concentrate even more on one single doctrine.
---
Many cap pilots will also have a subcap and a bomber on grid for example. Without TiDi they might want to cut one or two alts. And that won't be the cap/super probably.
---
I personally like TiDi, because it makes big fights more tactical. Doesn't need to be 10% though.
---
Module lag etc is the far bigger issue to me.
---
Cant chat if local doesnt show up.
---
Then why didn’t they changed it when they choses the shields ?
---
/u/ccp_falcon CCPlease! 
---
&gt; But then you'd just run a rainbow flight of every ewar drones, and practically get every ewar effect as a trade for your drone slots.
---
You trade your drone damage or that set of effects. And if you want to have them in reserve you trade some of your drone bay that could be dedicated to preventing you from being defanged. 
---
Plus i don't see that as a bad thing.
---
LOL.  Thanks, I'm glad somebody gets what I am doing.  And, I should have mentioned that I have a lot of free time.  
---
If there are multiple structures in the area, the structure browser menu is a great help in this! 
---
As far as I am concerned, Sleepers attack anything, no matter if you aggress them or not. Though I cannot tell you if there are deeper mechanics towards the sleeper aggressions. 
---
That's a really solid idea too honestly. The fact that CCP thinks cyno's as they are now isn't kind of gross, honestly bothers me.
---
Just like their [Vulture salvage ship](https://starcitizen.tools/Vulture)
---
There are a lot of items that have razor thin margins, and it's your job as an industrialist to increase that margin.
---
Buy ore at below refine value with perfect refine skill/implant to start increasing your profits, even if it's more of a trading profit than a manufacturing profit.
---
Then you start working in low tax citadels with 2/4% refine rig to turn the small margin into a medium margin.
---
Then you find something that has high usage and at least a 2% margin over base mineral value, and build it in a citadel with a material bonus of about 2%.
---
You suddenly have a 10-15% margin on what you are doing.
---
probably not, but since r/EvE has so much shit pent up it needs to vent somewhere...
---
Possible solutions:
---
* Buff ewar drones to not stacking penalise from the same source ship. Each ship still maxes at 5 drones, but this means the drones per ship are a lot more effective to that limit.
---
* add a small damage component to most ewar drones, to minimise the cost of not flying combat drones.
---
* increase ewar drone stats such as speed, hp, and signature to make them more reliable
---
Some or all of those could work to close the gap. 
---
More off the wall:
---
* Remove the 300 and 600 series drones. Buff the 900s to be much more effective singularly, but with a heavy stacking penalty for using multiples, making a single heavy ewar drone effective without five being devastating. For this the 900s would need to be buffed to light drone speed, arguably balanced by the lack of hp.
---
This was initial plan .... like ^waaay ^more ^ than other few things in history. 
---
when CCP fixes these issues: 300-500 years
---
if not: 2-5 years
---
Do not steal!
---
*YOOOOOOOOOO!!!!* It's your **7th Cakeday** NightMaestro! ^(hug)
---
I'm pretty sure it still would show up in System info -&gt; Structures. Other citadels I don't have access to do show up there.
---
Because the only people that look at killmarks is the pilot. That is because no one zooms in that much in space.
---
Yes, overgeneralization as I'm sure folks will say they look, but, face it, it is entirely pointless. 
---
It’s because they know, that every adventure starts with a venture.
---
#VentureMasterRace
---
I would have them keep the current effects, or just even toned down a bit, keep the stacking penalties etc. BUT make them near-indestructible, fast and with a larger optimal. 
---
Also let them be grouped with other drones and assistable. I would love to have the option to group 2 ogres with 3 webber/painter drones just to help with their application. The weird 75/100 bandwidth ships will have better options than the weird 2h/2m/1l setup.   
---
Also if you add bonuses to specific ewar drones (like carriers have) you can even afford to put in weird bandwidth limits - 60, 90, 110 etc.
---
Also, because every other type of ewar will only be useful for certain encounters. Tracking disruptors might be strong against artillery doctrines are completely useless against drone boats though. Target painters/webs usually only need to be on the primary target and you are better of using a recon for it. Also, no point painting BS in a cruiser doctrine etc.
---
ECM will be useful against every single doctrine more or less and since you only have room for one flight most of the time you might as well go with the most versatile one.
---
Might be an interesting idea, but you'd need to balance drones around it. Just adding the bonus to current drones would make them way stronger than even dedicated ewar ships.
---
thats because they mined their own free minerals for production.. 
---
at least, Eve Online works fine. RSI should take advice from CCP
---
Interesting idea. Would impact super umbrellas etc while not killing plays in capital engagements.
---
Don't think a jam chance would be great though. I think an entosis like mechanic would be better (with say a minute spool up). If there's a chance to fall off, the rescue fleet will just land once you lose a roll and you won't have gained that much. Requiring the ships on grid to kill the jamming ship to jump in reinforcements isn't too much to ask imo. 
---
Deus vult
---
RSI makes a lot of money ... so be careful what you ask for, as CCP could start taking advice from RSI. 
---
Why can't alliances be expected to have subcaps clear tackle before jumping in big stuff?
---
To answer Nr. 3 &amp; 4 in a bit more detail:  
---
No. 3. Deciding if you either want to use an Astrahus or a Raitaru (or just stick with an NPC station) depends on your own interests. If you fly around with a rather bad killboard and alot of expensive ships (Marauders, Miners, Haulers -&gt; Freigthers) and you do not have the experience and/or neutral alts to do certain tasks I'd not use a Citadel, just to avoid the risk of getting wardeced.
---
*Keep in mind that you will most likely only get wardeced flying around these certain types of ships* ***OR*** *if you are based in a system with alot of traffic/conflicts or being a burden to some other Corp around.* 
---
To compare these two smallest structures:
---
An Astrahus compared to a Raitaru has way better defences, featuring 2x Launcher Slots, the option to mount a bomb launcher (in certain regions) and the option to deploy fighters (in addition to more Slot options overall) give you a great variety of defences, though these defences are not ment to kill a ship alone. If you got less than 20 man to field at your defence times, people will be able to get rid of you no matter what. 
---
The reason you'd choose a Raitaru over an Astrahus would be the bonuses to Industry on it. While offering really limited defensive options, you have great bonuses to fuel consumtion for all types of industrial systems. If you just plan on using the Cloning Bay, go for the Astrahus, it will safe you money in the long run.
---
No. 4. Reaching CCP with your own, gamechangeing, ideas is hard. It requires you to have alot of people to back you up with your idea on either here, on Reddit, or the official Forums to be taken serious. (Made this experience myself). Highly requested suggestions will sometimes be taken into account, but these are either rare occaison or only very little changes.  
---
Fly Safe o7
---
That is expecting people value fights over killmarks though.
---
Goons don't drop titans on roaming gangs because they aren't able to engage them otherwise. 
---
It's more likely this is either being tested for ccps new mmo, or more likely ccp have been paid a fee for access to us the player base. Don't expect this tech to ever be in eve.
---
You must be a father. :)
---
Yeah isnt this why they recently moved the chat server off the main server into its own thing so its impact on game performance is minimal ?
---
Minmatar engineers just duct-taped a 5m^3 web to a 5m^3 drone (but weaker effect due to power supply issues)
---
Aside from the other drones being bad, module ECM is crap now after the nerf and people replace it with drones.
---
Selling promises isn't making money, it's raising funding.
---
It will potentially hit RSI very hard if it all comes down like a house of cards, and a class action suite finds that the early subscribers were in fact investors, despite whatever duress induced document they had them sign two years ago so they could get into the beta test.
---
Large autocannons are very good.
---
This was the weirdest foreplay i have ever witnessed.
---
Thanks, i hate it.
---
Do you remember shield slaves hype ... or walking in stations hype?
---
&gt; at least, Eve Online works fine
---
?????
---
Are we playing the same game?
---
That's an entirely unrelated argument.
---
CCP didn't announce either of those features as a standalone that they then began allowing their customers to prepurchase with real cash.
---
The announced features in an existing product that did not come to fruition. As a consumer, you have always had access to EVE Online as a product while you have been paying for it.
---
You don't go into a supermarket to buy oranges and then file a lawsuit against them for failing to supply apples.
---
Doesn't work these days with skill injectors though.
---
It's entirely a trading profit.
---
Which you're then throwing away, to subsidise someone else. Build something else with it, which makes a profit at market rates.
---
That would leave BR the only source of armor mods, i think. 
---
Angel is also shield, right?
---
You can do t4/t5 electricals in a 250-300mil phantasm :D
---
Or you could sell the minerals on the market, and make more isk...
---
small autocannons are useful but only on a few ships, like svipuls and claws
---
mediums can be powerful on cynabals, but they don't do a tremendous amount of dps. if they did, the ac muninn ahac would be viable :smith:
---
&gt;Get Off My Lawn
---
Possibly flairbait. Probably not.
---
with 3 toons, wh space could be a great place to you. 
---
you can have a paire of rattle/nestor + 1 scoot. or 3 nestors (riskier but more isk). gas huffing with multiple account could be realy profitable.
---
Would it be possible to get a fit? This doesn't seem to fit on PG, even with 2 ancillary rigs; is the shield boost ancil or XLSB or a certain deadspace?
---
60% of the time it works half the time.
---
idk for the neut but I'm sure the remote rep/capa draw agro. with a
---
What is most shocking to me, is how good Ogre SD-900s are. 70% damps is no joke. Of course large e-war drones are probably not gonna see much use ever, since if you can deploy a full flight, it is probably a big chunk of your dps. Wonder if it could be a viable option for the phoons though.
---
no
---
I dunno why but this made me tear up... Cos I am.
---
I'm literally crying over a rare moment on the internet where a wholesome comment was left in a hole on reddit

My mistake, I meant Large Shield Booster not XL. Here's my fit:

Hey thats my post...
---
I can tell a dad joke from a mile afar. :DDD
---
Have fun and fly safe, or dangerously if you fancy it more. 
---
Thanks bro, much appreciated.
---
no worries, practice on SiSi a bit so you get the target rotation down. Webbers &gt; Neuts &gt; Everything else. Keep your faction missiles on anything cruiser and below, switch to rage for battleships and that dumb battlecruiser spawn (it hurts a lot too btw). Drones aren't for dps, they are a distraction.
---
Wooot winmatar ftw. 
---
Considering that all Triglavian ships have some logistics capabilities, it wouldn't be surprising if that thing would end up being something in between a dread and fax.
---
My shield cane disagrees with this statement, many dps, good range 
---
as many of them are stacked in jita 4-4, that's a reasonable way to reset that, too :D
---
Run them in a drake and you’ll be fine. You’ll get tanked eventually, but you’ll make enough isk to cover it if you take even basic precaution (eg scout the chain for obvious threats before starting) 
---
I mean I can't think of a single place in k-space I roamed where at some point the response wasn't supers. 
---
Now maybe I pissed off everyone on eve, but I consider that unlikely as well I'm really not that important. 
---
in my somewhat limited experience...
---
t3 probably the sweet spot, past that you need to invest a lot in fitting/pod to reliably survive. Be careful, make sure to always take the "origin conduit" at the end and not the "proving conduit" unless you want to get [rekt by one of the abyssal pvp pros](http://www.abyssaldata.com/).
---
Flying tier 3s takes a bit of piloting skill, you need to know  how to deal with each kind of spawn since some can easily wreck you.
---
Regarding extraction nodes... depends on the spawn, some waves u have a lot of "idle time" (no serious threat form npcs but lots of hp to go through) so might as well go grab em if they are close - more often than not however I avoided them, since I was blitzing the tier 3s (exotic btw) to try and get lucky with rare loot (skillbooks etc).
---
I wish CCP made some long range sentry EWAR drones.
---
[removed]
---
I used this to run exotic t3s:
---
    
---
    [Gila, T3 Cheap Abyss]
---
    Drone Damage Amplifier II
---
    C3-A 'Hivaa Saitsuo' Ballistic Control System
---
    C3-X 'Hivaa Saitsuo' Ballistic Control System
---
    Large Shield Extender II
---
    Republic Fleet Large Shield Extender
---
    Adaptive Invulnerability Field II
---
    Pithum C-Type EM Ward Amplifier
---
    50MN Cold-Gas Enduring Microwarpdrive
---
    Rapid Light Missile Launcher II, Scourge Fury Light Missile
---
    [Empty High slot]
---
    Medium Core Defense Field Purger II
---
    Caldari Navy Vespa x4
---
    Federation Navy Hammerhead x2
---
    Imperial Navy Infiltrator x2
---
The damage mods can be changed based on budget (2x C3-A instead of C3-X work just fine) but you really want those Hivaa Saitsuo BCSes, since the double dip damage bonus is really saucy.
---
Regarding mid slots: 
---
- Depending on your fitting skills, you might not be able to fit the republic fleet LSEs; in that case just use caldari as they have similar cost. RF is better since it has a smaller sig penalty (you are gonna sig tank a lot) but requires more CPU (less PG too but that's irrelevant here)
---
- if going blingy, upgrade the MWD to a Corelum mwd (has the same, lowered, cap use as the enduring but more speed and less sig bloom) and use caldari navy LSE. Keep this in mind, shiny MWD will require more CPU, requiring you to use caldari navy LSEs instead of RF LSEs. Sig-wise, CN LSE + corelum MWD is better than enduring mwd + RF LSE.
---
- passive amp is usually cheap to bling and worth blinging, don't even bother with t2 since they are so cheap to run C-type. I cant recall if I ran a different hardener for exotics since I can't recall the DPS output of the rats you see in the sites, google is your friend - the other hardeners are VERY cheap to bling.
---
- blinging the invuln is expensive and unnecessary IMO, fit works fine with just the mods I have blung in the fit
---
...but have you heard about lack of lowsec gate to Stain?
---
fuck train, he need to inject - we could have 2 major issues solved
---
When is it ? I can't find the date on their website or the mails they sent.
---
A distant, primitive ancestor of the bot
---
i guess... if you think Eve doesn't work, don't ever try StarCitizen
---
Probably
---
because abyssals were released pretty recently, most ppl running them have been playing for yonks and it's considered end game - its easy to tell what fits work and what don't, much harder to say what skills are necessary.
---
Definitely want T2 for deeps, core skills, fitting skills most likely, any cap skill you can feasibly get should be at least lvl 4...
---
Wod hype was the worst bamboozle ever. 
---
that battlecruiser spawn is misleading as  fuck, everything will be going well then suddenly whoops there goes the hull alarm...
---
Medium lasers, nerf jaguar please ccp
---
i sometimes launch one ECM drone, one target painting drone, one energy neutraliser drone, one sensor damping drone, and one tracking disruption drone. two reasons:
---
1. no stacking penalties ftw
---
2. they'll see all the EW icons on their hud and think "ah fuck, look at all the stuff they're using on me, im fucked!" morale warfare motherfuckers, maybe they'll even panic or give up, not realising they're only small drones. and even if they realise, it'll still make it harder for them to see what kinds of actual ewar we have on them - have fun mousing over everything. 
---
EVE isnt dying...

...It is just being assimilated by the Borg and cybermen.

look if i can have holographic cat ears on a avatar or ragnarok, i will buy that and BRIDGE EVERY FLEET THERE EVER WAS

Ah. I completely forgot serpentis. well than it's either 3:2 in favor of either armor or shield, i guess.

Guide on how to make actual monies in T3s.
---
1. fit Orthrus or Cerb with XL-ASB and the most amount of dps you can (3 damage mods + t2 damage rig).
---
2. run t3 darks. They are dirt cheap, cause gilas and turret ships cant do them and only  have upsides for rlml-based ships. Added velocity means you can kite easier, also means that orbiting NPCs will miss you cause their AI is dumb and they outttrack themselves.
---
3. enter proving conduit. I know this sounds like bait cause i pvp there a lot, but hear me out first:
---
* as of now at least 80% of the time noone shows up (this is EU-TZ based, i heard in US-TZ these dont even really spawn)
---
* pvp pocket regulars are easy-ish to spot at https://zkillboard.com/kills/abyssalpvp

* loot is not amazing, but pretty decent (anywhere from 20-200 mil, mostly about 30-40 in abyss materials)

lol remember taking IH money for an eviction and getting stomped and horizon tried to get you not to lol. RIP the only thinking group in hole control.

its been like this for literally years. get your caps ready.

Why is the map so slow to load? I figured out that once it's loaded you just want to minimize it (rather than closing the window with the 'x'). But man, this is annoying.
---
&gt;Fixed several problems with the expiry of wormholes, especially for null-sec wormholes. This should fix the problem of wormholes collapsing when trying to jump through.

Naaaaaaice.

What did you expect, PL started building Supers 6 months before Dominion, Goons take the now necessary new space already a few months before ... nothing changed ... only the Tickers 
---
Does this mean we can keep our Geminate holes 24/7?
---
Doesn´t mean it didn´t happen anyway. Even if the CSM knew about it i kinda doubt they´d have gotten any real numbers on it. And taking space knowing there´s a change coming but not knowing what exactly is a waste of manpower. You deal with it once it hits you.

Fuck games that have been in alpha for 5 fucking years, taking in hundreds of millions in revenue, in return for a never ending flow of feature creep.

Are FoF missiles still a hot pile of useless? Last I remember there was little point in training them.

Heh. &lt;3 you guys.

tmk it means it might now be worthwhile scanning for juicy routes in the four hours preceding DT.

That shit's been a problem for the better part of a decade now, lol.

Groundbreaking stuff right here. Will be keeping those accounts unsubbed it seems.

Sorry which ones are the fof missiles?

So big games should be done under 5 years of dev time?

What he said
---
I've not seen any kind of change to ewar/utility drones since I started playing in early Tyrannis days.
---
VR
---
everyone seems to say ' but they do hit because'
---
like, ive done it, vindi webs cap guns, i know with support things apply. but what we are discussing is a gun ona  ship. not a fleet setup.
---
out of interest are you saying here that an arty nag can web and target paint a sub cap and hit it? i will be interested to simulate this.
---
what i think your saying, is a painted AND webbed by somthing closeby target can be hit by an arty nag 50-100km off or further?
---
Yep to free Delve of Renters so CFC Core can spread out more, also Bastion to Fountain ... you won't change my mind, I am around for too long and have seen too much ...

Auto - targeting missiles
---
I was shocked too. when I saw the title "whiptail down" post i was like "meh..." But then I saw that you were the owner...OH F*!. 
---
Well, I hope you had fun with that ship and think about the fact that you almost lost it to gate smartbombs the first day. But, instead, You have much stories to tell about it and I will never forget the BRAVE mob that tried to catch you last year. 
---
Stay sharp o/ ! 
---
Sabot 
---
I think they changed the name to auto targeting missiles at some point but yeah, they're still not used much
---
Would be interesting to change some of these drones. A random idea would be to make them all large size (25, so bigger ships can field more) and add tech2 Variants to adapt the purpose.
---
Berserker SW-900 I:  1.2km/s MWD, 20% Web
---
Berserker SW-900 Grapple Variant II: 1.2km/s MWD, 30% Web
---
Berserker SW-900 Hunter Variant II: 3.5km/s MWD, 15% Web
---
Would imagine it would need alot of testing/tweeking as you wouldn't want drones to replace dedicated tackle ships (rip huginn). Would also be cool for drone boats to improve electronic warfare as well as damage.
---
Thanks for being gratuitously hostile. Makes it easy to see that nothing changed since I left.
---
im fully aware of what i insinuated. not that i specificly call us eve players 'morons' but the ones with the ability to create tactical inventions and think on the fly have long since gone,
---
the likes of RnK and their style of prototype play,
---
maybe there's a few FC's or thoerycrafters in Initiative left that have some pretty impressive ideas, i can damn well be sure TEST and all dried up on that subject.
---
These actually are fairly promising patch notes. And I'm not usually one to move CCP more credit than is due.
---
But yeah I'm not resubbing either.
---
10Gb is pretty much a basline speed within most data centers. Fast connections can be anywhere from 25/40/100/400Gb.
---
Defender missiles - they are only usable really in 1 situation - fleet pvp as a defensive weapon against bomber bombs. But people do use them, its just a very niche thing.
---
Auto targeting missiles - barely used... I have seem them being used on some occasions in like wormhole space for PVE, but the usage is still veeeery niche if any at all...
---
I would say railguns (not to confuse with blasters) are a bit less common than other weapon systems I suppose. Yes, they do see quite a bit of action with small rails on cormorants and medium rails for ferox and eagles in fleet pvp, but they will be a lot less used in PVE and large railguns are also not that popular/useful.
---
Generally I would say projectile weapons could be the most used maybe? You really have to know what do you want to do in PVP/PVE, than take into consideration where you are - highsec, null, wh, big alliances/small gangs or solo etc. Why its important? Well, the choices vary a lot because of that. For example - you join a big nullsec block and all of their doctrines they fly are shield based. This automatically limits what weapon platforms you will be using and what race ships you will be flying. Also bigger alliances will usually limit their doctrines so you don't have to train all the weapon platforms and ship skills for all the races.
---
Lol
---
To be fair, CCP adjusted the Haven respawn some time ago and they also wrote it in the same manner that there WILL BE future tweaks as well. It was just a matter of time when CCP finally addresses this.
---
TBH Much Simpler if they give cynos a long activation time and the cyno starts the cycle again should the ship launching it get any damage.
---
That would mean more skill needed by the cyno ship to find a good place to drop anchor and skill from any fleet who does get dropped to primary the cyno ship before the jump link is stable.
---
that domi will eat shit to another t1 bs. just take a nid, fit it for solo. aligns as fast as a BS, warps as fast as a cruiser and kills everything consistently between frig and BS. don't get baited but the same goes for the domi which doesn't even have a jump drive 
---
Its a decent update, whats wrong with it?
---
Wow thats what I call a fast implementation, from Komodo-Loss to official patchnote within a week ...
---
didn't say nothing about any other size ac or arty 
---
Don't say that to anyone who works in accounts or corporate finance. They'll get the strong urge to throw you from the nearest, highest cliff. It might not have cost ISK, but time is also a cost.
---
More like Space Protestants. They came from a split of the United Catholic Church. 
---
seems like those "Balance changes" CCP was talking about are coming nicely, so many balance changes this patch...
---
the amount of promised "balance changes" that cost us the AT...
---
Oh please... You forgot to add that even the janitors @ CCP are forced to focus on making skins....
---
just let the idiots dump cheap shit on the market then buy it and resell for a profit... win win. they get to sell their shit because the minerals they mined are free while you save time for building other stuff while profiting off of idiots...
---
On that last point, I'm not gonna ask you what it was, but I will ask how you figured out that it was something that could make you that kind of cash? Still relatively new to anything other than Eve Mining and a bit of a hauling, so reading all the stats and stuff for the market is still something I'm getting my head around. I'm not really the PVP type, so I want to diversify out to a lot of the non-PVP things (hauling, trading, mining, manufacture, refining, etc).
---
Let us pray 
---
TheJudge always looks desperately inappropriate, so many things make sense when you just look at his body language
---
wat?
---
the announcement CCP made when they cancelled AT was that there would be balance changes - first patch since then, not a single whiff of said changes...
---
Defender missiles are mostly utilized in fleets - they kill stealth bomber bombs.
---
they'll copy that into SC next
---
I really hope the editing is not so bad, I'm an amateur with no skill at all ! Sadly the sound did not made it and since I'm lazy... well, open Below The Asteroid in another window, and enjoy the best sound of EVE :D
---
And yes, carriers don't need a balance, I really don't know what you are talking about ?
---
Its been literally just 3 weeks, jeeez.... They never really said - we are cancelling AT because we have to do balance changes.
---
Holy fuck, I did not expect to see wormholes in there..
---
As if EVE being full of little shits like you was ever a reason to not play it. 
---
LEGIO still living in the HY-RWO area, after all these years! -A- is long gone, but LEGIO remains. Say hi to Primus, from an old friend. And o7 to your beloved Crow!

Again wow 
---
Stupid ninja cutting onions.
---
I don’t think anyone here cares enough to change your mind but you may want to know there are no renters or pets in Delve, only Imperium members.
---
Good post, and good point. People complain about tidi and soul crushing lag, if there is even a glimmer that this will fix it hell yeah! 
---
So people should help if they can instead of guessing why it might not work 
---
Sounds like when Mittani was pimping out goons for H1Z1
---
It's been 7 years and they aren't even close to finishing.
---
It'll be 9 at least before it's fully released.
---
Meanwhile elite dangerous has been out 3 years 
---
It's because of all the live data from across New Eden that is loaded into it dynamically; live cynos, number of gate jumps in last 30 minutes, active JB networks you can or cannot access based on ACLs, etc.
---
It should be quicker if you reduce some of the data it is pulling from the filters; mine doesn't take longer than a second on most occasions.
---
Shhhh, you are interrupting superimportant "GRRRRR, GOONS BAD!" circlejerk. Step away unless you want to be covered in cum.
---
You have been warned. :)
---
I miss you vids sabotage...
---
Sure, just after they release the game. 
---
&gt; no renters or pets .... Imperium members.
---
hmkay ... 
---
CCP said they would keep adjusting them in the December patch. The ISK Velocity and ISK being generated from bounties is still far too much, so it's no surprise to anyone really. 
---
Thanks, I've reported it, then felt bad, then posted it in the QoL forum post.
---
The AT died for this
---
What do you need to test exactly? It does not affect your signature window or ability to use probes (cores/combats alike). It ONLY affects you d-scan results. Since you use core probes to scan down signatures and they won't be affected by the mobile scan inhibitor, we know people will be able to scan down the ded signature without any issues.
---
Awesome job
---
I'm not one of the downvotees, but your comment seems like revisionist history to me. We were on grid before all the test titans jumped out, and the komodo never looked to get anywhere near the gate, it was the one ship we were focused on holding down.
---
If he did desync then why not petition the loss to CCP? Also if you're going to to have a blob of titans you have to mad expect bumps.
---
Also to your first comment there is absolutely no way that loss caused the fix in the patch, there is no why you can implement something like that quickly and test it enough to send out. 
---
Let them taste their own medicine
---
Keep up doing goods work
---
I can fly every ship in the game but my majority time flying pvp is in frigs and dessies. Don't worry that much about the big stuff. Small ship pvp is much more fun. Although solo battleship pvp is a bunch of fun when you get good. 
---
Different Life. Different Style. In this video the german warps off while the french stays on grid.
---
RIP and props for flying it and using it! Hope you had fun with it....it's all space pixels in the end.
---
Wrong world
---
No, I'm not. It was my nickname when I was in OP corp  :)
---
It does affect probes. If a signature is the point on warp-in gate, it could affect core probes.
---
&gt;CFC
---
lol
---
The first time we heard about another anomaly change was when we read this, same as you. We had no heads up on this change and we don’t know what it is. 
---
Sorry to burst your narrative. 
---
What a waste of pixels!
---
Why are C3’s in an alpha drake/Myrm a bad idea?
---
You might be confusing some definitions there brochacho, coalition members, however terrible alliances they come from, are infact neither renters not pets.

They may actually add faction capitals to other pirate factions or remove them from blood raiders as well.

He should have been mining spod on one screen while art designing a new Vulture/Venture skin on the other.
---
Yes because if the CSM had leaked info they would totally be owning up to it?
---
I personally don't care if you knew before hand or not, but your comment literally means nothing. 
---
“No one believes HK getting evicted isn’t a big deal”, proceeds to explain in fourteen paragraphs why it wasn’t a big deal. 
---
Ok, then. 
---
They've been looking into this for a long time. It's been reported by wormholers for years due to the bump heavy nature of heavy armor brawls. 
---
Until the Goon is defeated. 
---
Whatever makes you sleep at night.
---
Pff, medium heavy beams ftw.
---
Beam zealot is fun in small gang. 800ish dps with multi at 27km and ~500ish out to 50km. Plus a drone bay for EC300s for jag.
---
Navy harb is fun too with beams. 
---
Outside of jags/wolfs, they provide great grid support. Since you can shoot at pesky long range caracals or jackdaws, right into their resist holes. Just make sure your gang has some antitackle for jags/wolf and youre good.
---
&gt; taking space knowing there´s a change coming but not knowing what exactly is a waste of manpower
---
TEST and GSF both kicked their pets/renters out, no effort required.
---
I too suspected CSM leaks when I saw the changes on the map, especially after listening to the Red Alliance SOTA, but CCP already released an experimental version of this nerf to ratting anoms months ago, so not like it was hard to predict more nerfs were coming.
---
I still believe the narrative for RA leaving Period Basis was largely made up by Goons tho, so maybe they did have confirmation.
---
DUDE chat is the hardest part of any game. It takes at least 15 years to perfect in game chat.
---
Dont fly FOTM. When you dont fly FOTM you get a buff everytime they make changes. As all the ship improvements happen to the ones you fly :)
---
Of course, I'm updating it daily
---
Like most tests, this will go down in EU time, during the work week, so there is no chance in hell I will make it.
---
 And that's all I have to say about that. 
---
I love how PLNC have totally abandoned supers/titans
---
Better to get blown up at all than rot in a hangar. I aspire to fly my ships the same way.
---
besause blaster and hull tank
---
I build t2 fighters.
---
I build the t1 fighter, I react the moon goo, and I mine a majority of the raw minerals. 
---
Taking an Ametat II for example my net cost, *full disclosure*, is roughly 15,000,000 a pop and that’s based on Jita split ore prices (*nearly 40% of a fighter’s cost is the t1 component, which I mine, so it’s free!*). This 15m is also excluding the amount of moon goo I mine myself as well, so ~technically~ about 7-9m manufacturing cost is whatever I deem my isk/hr to be. 
---
With 10 industrial alts I can pump out roughly 5,000 Ametat IIs a week realistically. Do I? No, that’s way too autistic for me as I would have to source a lot of the minerals vs. what I source myself. 
---
If I had to venture a guess...
---
"I don't care if you knew or not but you definitely leaked"   
---
t. Spodbrain 
---
just clear the rats like most of the loot in those sites is blue anyway. 
---
I think so too, just wanted to make a joke related to current events
---
Or an actual lowsec gate to stain🤔
---
they are renting out the new space. You need to learn how to read all the good gossip sites and get your facts straight. LOL
---
Ahh yes, the age old 'Bring more friends', because what this game needs more of is blobs and not good game design and balance
---
But it's unfair !! Right when I get my titan and was about to titan rat all the day :(
---
It's not entirely out of the sandbox; you can see the abyssal trace, scan it down and gank him when he is forced to return.
---
All is not totally out of the sandbox.
---
You might need to learn to read, I said if it was leaked it's not like anyone would own up to it, that in no way is saying it was leaked.
---
The first anyone on the CSM knew they were adjusting anomalys again was about 2 hours ago when the patch notes went live. 
---
Capital railguns.
---
I'm sure you're going to have lots of fun in this game, when pretty much all the random PvP dries up and there's nothing left except krabbing.
---
Have you actually ever sat back and looked at where the game is heading? or is your "BUT MUH TICKS!!!11!11" blinding you to the fact that unless something changes, all the isk in your wallets aint gonna mean shit because the game will be boring as fuck
---
I think you are getting downvoted because people think you are implying that the reason the Komodo died was because of a desync and not because he bumped... idk tho, why even care on this forum ... 
---
Cruise Missiles V
---
Why not look in the Activity Tracker for that?   
---
Shocking news: Nobody, except yourself, is looking at your killmarks anyways :D  
---
Well, they have to actually play a decent game once in a while. it sure gets boring working on a ponzi scheme all day.
---
As one can read, the bumps (that you admitted) often were the reason for desyncs. As I understood the reports he bumped and desynced ad could not jump gate although his overview told him he was in jump range
---
No don't bother. You will just contribute to diluting the market of currently very expensive items. Better off ratting anomalies imho
---
Actually the venture is at the end of an adventure...
---
Why do you think we have a declining player base?   
---
Only because a few (maybe known) players announce on reddit they are leaving doesn't mean we bleed players all over the place.   
---
Cruise missiles in general or just V itself?
---
&gt; It'll be 9 at least before it's fully released.
---
9 more you mean.
---
Is that the reward from the adventure then? 
---
A good amount of players have no idea that AAA games are in development around 8 years at a minimum. It's because they only announce games around 2 years from release.
---
That 'reported' desync didn't stop him unplugging implants. 
---
I hope fucking not. I want it to release and be good and i will glady eat my words and play the fuck out of it. 
---
Or release and be shit so i can claim some bullshit superiority.
---
Its torture dealing with the SC fanboys i play Eve with.
---
"BUT ITS NOT RELEASED YET" fuckkk ooffff
---
The fact that both sides didnt turn and kill pirat is the real crime here
---
Maybe he just went with the HG DinoBrain Set ?
---
Why not just roll some damage into ewar drones. Kind of like fighters. They can still do ewar and apply a little dps.
---
It really is. Just look at how retarded renters are buying AT ships now because of how easy it is to make ISK. 
---
Do the math of mineral cost vs item cost. Look at the volume sold per day. Compare it to other items. Voila.
---
It was announced on the meat show that Period Basis is a renter region, with actual renters, not Imperium members.
---
&gt; Fixed clipping of the Men's 'Lockstep' Boots through the Men's 'Commando' Pants.
---
duh
---
Shining Loparite 
---
Is it possible that not all of the csm members got the info? 
---
Yea, nah, not in a komodo, not even they are that bad. 
---
What'd you test, a time machine?
---
They're Changing the "socket closed" message? Does that mean GM Socket Closed is no longer relevant? Damn.
---
Mad respect bro
---
Oni would like a word.
---
3D printer settings ahah
---
/r/evejobs
---
what cheese is that?
---
Subreddit: evejobs 
---
That's why I caveated my post with 'if it all comes down'.
---
I can't comment on if they are delivering or not as I don't have a vested interest in following the project. I do know that projects that remain in the development cycle for so long that they miss their optimal market introduction point do tend to fail quite spectacularly though.
---
If CCP and Hadean can get their engine integrated properly before Star Citizen properly launches, RSI will have a very hard time winning over market shares from their competitors.
---
Well, regardless of whether you believe the narrative for RA or not, the fact remains that Period Basis is a renter region, and with only one exception, Imperium krabs are hard banned from krabbing there. We announced it on the Meat show a while back, even.
---
I guess if an Imperium krab really wanted to, they could rent from us in Period Basis, but it seems kinda silly to do that when you can just krab for free under a super umbrella in Delve.
---
vintage cheddar ;)
---
r/evejobs can help you find a corp, or else you can just join recruitment channel in game
---
Ah neat, at first glance it looked like one of those old timey photographs.
---
Newer pilots or pilots inexperienced with the market miss the fact that you can see market metrics for every item in Eve through the market interface.
---
You can see the volume of sales as well as medians for price metrics.
---
There are aggregating web sites that condense this data, but I haven't done market warfare in years so I'm not up on the best ones.  Maybe someone else can provide info.
---
At the very least, check out the bottom tabs in the market window.  They'll give you an idea of what people are buying - but don't always go based on that.  Do as much research as you can to try and figure out why: is it a price drop?  Then based on price history, may not be profitable.  Is it an ongoing nullsec conflict?  Might be a good idea to stock market hubs near those regions.
---
Unless you have the ability to produce extremely rare items efficiently, don't expect a quick turn around.  Just because something moves well one week doesn't mean you'll sell any for the whole next month.  There are plenty of variables to consider.  Especially when you have market pros (bots?) changing their price to undercut you by .01 isk every time you put something on the market.
---
Its called a lithophane and thats kinda the point of them, work best with faces but this one turned out nice. 
---
........... how much does it cost? 5k?
---
What features are they adding?
---
It also helps if you can perfect refine / invent, have access to decryptors, and have some luck on your side.
---
But, yeah, if you're harvesting the ore, perfectly refining, getting decryptors, running invention and producing in your own citadels - then there is no trade overhead.  But don't undercut your feet out from under yourself:  You never know when someone else may be doing the same thing and are willing to make less than what you consider satisfactory.
---
Wait.. can you use that as a stamper?
---
As someone that is often on the other side of discussions, I have to agree with you on this one. Have an upvote to even it out.
---
stamper?
---
Bet he got the bugeye when he replied to you that he gets when he's salty after a loss.
---
I can't find the right word D: 
---
http://moocb.fi/mcb_wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Leimasinkahva_vaneri2-1200x1200.jpg like this
---
I like how you're being downvoted even though CCP literally said they'd be focusing on balance when they axed the AT. 
---
An ink stamp?
---
oooo... ive not thought about that, maybe think you would have to change it to a negative before hand.
---
Cool idea!
---
I bought a Retaliator and some other stuff ... my SC experience can be summarized to :         
---
*Boost* ... shit i fell out of textures again, back to netfix        
---
SC and EVE have to much difference. I really don't know why people compare them because they simply aren't comparable. The playstyle alone is waaay different than SC. 
---
This ^.  I can't remember the last time I fit autocannons on anything.  Note I don't do small gang or solo stuff.  Prob more useful there.  Don't think there's a fleet doctrine ship that uses them.  At least not in my hanger.
---
looking at this...makes me wonder if anyone's done EVE graffiti somewhere in the world of art like this.
---
Respect for the massive brass balls to fly around in a ship like that.
---
These comments are kinda irksome.
---
It's not the real world.  In the real world, a corporation of ratters would be very ticked off if one guy was mining and building stuff talking about "free mineralz!" - not just the accounting department.
---
The biggest issue with this comment is you assume it's everyone's goal to maximize their isk no matter what.  It's not.  Some people want to produce things.  Some people want to mine the materials.  Some people want to invent.  Not everyone wants to afk in a VNI.
---
Of course it's not "free" isk.  But it is zero trade overhead.  And that's good enough for some people.
---
Most eve players dont make it outside 
---
Goons drop titans on roaming gangs because *they don't want roaming gangs in their space*.
---
There are no good corps in this game so not worth the effort. Just pick one that seems least bad and go with it.
---
Nobody mentioned a leak until you. By saying "I'm not saying it was leaked but..." Inferring is the same as saying it.
---
Talking in stations discord has a corp section you could look at.
---
I know this is CCP we're talking about so them spamming position updates without a vector change sounds totally plausible.
---
^(Beloved Lord Sansha Kuvakei please hear our words and help CCP...)
---
Do you think that bringing more people with better firepower shouldn't give you a win? (unless you get massively outplayed, which does happen sometimes)
---
You’ll struggle to run them and will be extremely low. While you MAAAAAY make more isk than a C2 you will be spending much more time on sites which makes you an easier target.
---
:( i would have loved to press F1 on that ... 
---
Hot iron brand
---
Everywhere is always a risk. Dock up the stratios until you can use a covert ops cloak. 
---
Join Eve University - they will help you and teach you and not 'extort' you like Pandemic Horde. 
---
Wrong, friendo
---
Uh defender missiles are super valuable if you're operating outside Empire space
---
Have you tried not roaming where people, who are superior to you, don't want you to roam?
---
Try going to lowsec or a group that likes good fights in their home.
---
We put small ACs on our Snatch fleet CMDs, but really that's because they'll fit and something is better than nothing
---
ya!
---
How do you not understand that they're releasing stuff they've been working on for the past few months?
---
You're both being downvoted because you're spouting stupidity. Development takes time and testing.
---
I think the ability to instantly drop the most powerful ship, with ridiculous application to even the smallest ships and an engagement profile that is grid wide is pretty OP. 
---
There is 0 counter play to this except bringing 100+ people, it's killing the game
---
https://giphy.com/gifs/puss-in-boots-ooh-3eHJyY8QoLFo4
---
How fast do you think developers can turn major changes around? Do you think they just need to tweak a few numbers and throw it out?
---
It could be that it's not worth the hassle, or that legal would very much not like to have that discussion in reverse about the moa/firefly neither. 
---
There isn't supposed to be counter play. It is supposed to be unfair because they have the advantage.
---
You came to fight a massive entity and got out-escalated. Your choices are run or die. HTFU
---
&gt;    When encountering the different pirate factions around New Eden, capsuleers will be able to hear distinctly different communications chatter based on which pirate faction they come in contact with.
---
Am I the only one who thinks this is neat? I'm all for EVE feeling more alive.
---
I do like the idea of a TP sentry
---
I never said they weren't, but they are a pretty niche thing that is not always needed and you don't fit them on any ships you get your hands on and they are not part of every fleet... Also you don't see people training to to level V as a priority... Sure, if you want to fly fleet doctrine T3Ds, yeah you need that skill, otherwise - not really.
---
Coming soon from the same nine women that brought you a baby in a single month!
---
Does that make you more money than just selling the components and resources?
---
&gt;Development takes time and testing.
---
For a 200 person organization, the amount of work they're putting out is just pathetic. 
---
It feels as though they're working in secret on another failed project. 
---
i lol'd hhahahah :)
---
How viable is it for a solo player to own a structure in low/high sec?  
---
Will it be attacked right away or is there anything I can do to defend it solo?  
---
I am thinking for both bpo stuff(invention and research) and manufacturing.
---
&gt; it seems kinda silly to do that when you can just krab for free under a super umbrella in Delve.
---
so can any potential renter. this isn't 2013.
---
Most fleets aren't brawly fleets, in the era of bosons and bullshit
---
I guess if all you want to do is f1 monkey in goons, as opposed to flying cool shit with init
---
Do you think everyone works on the same thing? 
---
Should the HR people start sitting around Fozzie and help him code out some new shit? Should the accounting department or server admins get over and help them start balancing things?
---
Baltec and rohk fleets were super common, and a couple of blobs still run megas with rails. Cool comp. 
---
I used to use eve mentat but I think it has been abandoned. I think you'll find that most of the previous programs were abandoned. I think this stems from the fact that these programs allowed for more automation of market management which is no longer allowed.
---
Is there a tool that tells you whether it’s cheaper to buy and refine ore or-buy refined materials
---
What exactly from this list can take months of development and testing?
---
Maybe it wouldn't have died if you fit it properly...
---
Thank you for playing.
---
&gt;Adjustments have been made to the respawn rates of certain nullsec anomalies. These adjustments are part of a gradual ongoing process that will see further tweaks for this type of content.
---
&gt;During any war cool-down period either side of the old war can choose to declare a new war instantly if both sides are war eligible. Any new war started during the cool-down of an old war involving the same parties will immediately end the old war early and start the new war with fighting enabled (no 24 hour spool-up). This new war is still subject to the same billing and eligibility requirements of any normal war.
---
&gt;Fixed an issue in the physics engine with collision handling that could lead to ship position/velocity becoming desynchronised between server and clients.
---
&gt;Fixed a problem where cloaking ships were sometimes not fully removed from observing clients, if they were observing space from viewing outside from an Upwell structure. This could also lead to desync.
---
&gt;Fitting simulation: It is now possible to filter the hardware browser by subsystems for T3 cruisers - in combination with the filter for rigs.
---
Retarded, possibly. Ironic? No.
---
Well you need them for large ;)
---
But medium is in a bad place yes and ccp doesn’t really understand it.  
---
Nonsense, it was obviously a hidden message only CSM could read.
---
Yes, much more.
---
Nice hyperbole. 
---
In high sec it shouldn’t ever really be attacked unless it is low power or somebody notices it’s an alt corp owning it and is uber protective of their system indexes. 
---
Really though it should be quite safe in high sec. Even low sec should be relatively safe as long as you aren’t infringing on an area somebody considers their territory. You’d need a jump freighter for that though. 
---
Do you think everyone works on the same thing, yes or no?
---
It does tho. There's a few % tryhards that will inject instantly to anything new, but most people won't.
---
Wrong if you want down the Raven/Golem tree for ratting /Mission running then they are fantastic.  
---
&gt; Level 4 and 5 Agent missions are now only accessible for Omega Accounts
---
F to the mission runners.
---
&gt;Nice hyperbole
---
"I will believe anything that comes out of the mouth of a CSM because it's a saint and a holy person"
---
C'mon Suitonia... It's like bad cops. I would definitely believe whatever _you_ say but you can't blindly defend your CSM peers just because they're on the CSM.
---
If this was actually true, there would be zero renters in the east. I would agree that, in a vacuum, the correct choice would be to join an Imperium alliance rather than rent, but in reality there are more factors than that. That’s why hostiles can still find renters, and why we feel that we can too. 
---
I see them from time to time, but combat drones are far more useful. It has nothing to do with the strength of ew drones compared to their ship modules. The stacking of 5 ew drones is effective enough, but when we all cry love for DPS... no one wants to sacrifice any. 
---
My only regret is that Simple Farmers killed it and not one of us, whose space you terrorized with it for so long...
---
7o Crow. Farewell.
---
Lost a carrier for 2 VNI and a kiki.
---
How about pve wise, I’m not too keen on ratting or missions, my pve is mostly exploration..
---
You're repping CODE., I don't expect a whole lot from you.
---
You mean you need something to get on the killmails.
---
Yup, this is true!!
---
oh sorry i forgot about that Jackdaw
---
in the end it will be exactly that - a few minor value tweaks. "we think that X weapon system is underrepresented so we decided to give it 10% more optimal/tracking/falloff"
---
Nice, following up with an ad hominem. 
---
You can keep throwing out all the logical fallacies but you haven't answered any questions, you've just deflected.
---
Alphas can't use MJD
---
Fuck off isd moron idiot 
---
The "interested parties" they invited were goons. So, init isnt about to attack their handlers. 
---
Personally when you willingly invite goons or their puppets to wspace conflicts, you arnt just scraping the bottom of the barrel, your poking a hole in it, stuffing your dick through and telling everyone it's time to bob for earth worms.
---
Gotta agree, as a mostly minmatar pilot. I trained medium blasters just to have a brawler option.
---
This depth of respect is beautiful
---
I'm too lazy to read these. so can someone tell me what I should be complaining about today? 
---
I'm very aware. Just poking init since they evicted HK for what inner hell's daily operating procedure is.
---
Large autos are pretty strong tho...
---
tbh, with delve price and insurance, it was almost even :D 
---
Plus it had some kills before so well.. I call it worth it xD
---
PH will extort you? Serious question. 
---
Hi StainGuy. 
---
Literally all of thes comments are in response to a comment suggesting this info came out early from CSM, it has 31 up votes as of my posting this, are you fucking blind? 
---
So we measure the veracity of something by popular opinion?
---
Can we die in peace and be irrelevant quietly please? 
---
I quit the game a year ago, Eve used to have a pretty large community of solo PvP'ers releasing video's and content, I was looking on my youtube feed today and most of the people I used to know or fly with haven't released a video in over a year.
---
You're right, I choose to try my best not engage people who immediately jump into painfully obvious logical fallacies. 
---
Did he get reimbursed due to the desync, or is that a "cost of doing business"?  I imagine the latter but perhaps the former is visible to support.
---
&gt; I named her Bigsharkbait’s Crow, for she is neither crow, nor mine. 
---
I died...
---
&gt; That's why some (not all) EVE bittervets insist on attacking SC for simply being the new kid on the block.
---
Pretty sure most people attack it for being the most expensive unfinished game ever. 5 years on from the original intended release date and still no end in sight. What would have been a game ahead of its time will now become something generic if/when it finally gets released.
---
They didn't say what the adjustment was.  So, anybody?  What did they do to it?
---
So, Ark?
---
WHOA WHOA whoa there suitonia you are fucking up the gergune narrative
---
Nice!! Hope you can make it out. 
---
&gt; as well as a massive list of fixes for audion and graphics
---
Well...Heres some irony to start your Friday.
---
Glad you can make it! See you there. 
---
OH SHIT BUY RORQUAL BUY BUY BUY
---
&gt; Bounties from NPCs, which are killed by Upwell structures, are now being paid out to the controller of the structure.
---
I was bitching all week about how I wasn't getting ticks for blowing up rats with our keepstars and out of no where CCP fixes it. :spooky:
---
Tis but a joke...
---
I always preferred weapon system that are also good for ISK making: Missiles and Drones. Gila and VNI are great of PVE and also for PVP if you can afford to lose them.
---
Surprised they haven't actually started selling space stations for cash yet. Or have they? I don't really know =P
---
You said no one brought up leaks until me, I am telling you that is objectively untrue. 
---
Got it.
---
Hell you don’t even need to blow them up, the other day, The Initiative stole a hel from a NC./PL pos up in their space.
---
Do you have a random fit you could share? I can't seem to fit a Drake that gets more than 200-300 DPS, which doesn't seem like quite enough to perform well in Sleeper sites, especially given that the Rykki WH guide expects 400 DPS for C1 sites.
---
&gt;These comments are kinda irksome.
---
Call it irksome if you like, but if you don't value your time, you're doing yourself a disservice.
---
you tell em!
---
Did they only start development at the time they announced they won't be doing AT?
---
Lmao ISD 
---
Praise Bob, brother. She roams the next world now, maybe together with my 34 killmark Murder Probe that died due to pilot error. At least they went down doing what they loved.
---
In what system?
---
brains
---
This dude came to Brave space basically every day for like a year to gank in this ship. He never got caught. He was YOLOing that hull. Respect.
---
Sc's version would have *no* gates to Stain, it would only be accessible via random WHs. And all the NPCs changed to v.1 Drones (no bounties, only poop). No money moons, either.
---
Shout out to BL , IA and HOBO. you guys are generating nice content in a region that was a year or 2 ago, completely dead. Keep it up
---
Oh lol, I just noticed, they called the [bug fixes and exploits in the wardec system "balance"](https://updates.eveonline.com/), shieeeet dude such balance, much wow, we were wrong, CCPs balancing the game!
---
Those default brackets and window positions, though.
---
Not sure what you mean by that.  Your logic is the value of time is equal to the amount of isk you're making.  It isn't for tons of people, and shouldn't be.  It's not an isk-making game.  That's not where the value is.  If it were, no one would be doing anything except the thing that makes the most isk.
---
Ooh. Burn.
---
funny how the right answer is being downvoted. A regular indy guy just cannot compete with 0% structures that have tech II rigs and near free minerals from rorqual mining. you just can't.  do PI, do margin trading. Forget about production.
---
Join Brave. Come to Catch. Sit in standing fleet. Fight all day.
---
SC looks like a scam project, but let's not pretend like Eve didn't copy Robert's earlier work too.  
---
Imitation is the highest form of flattery.
---
rockets is real shit
---
I'll take "everything that's wrong with EVE" for 200, Alex.
---
I’ve run C3 sites with a sub 5 mil sp toon using both semi-expensive fit Myrmidons and cheap fit Rattlesnakes. It’s better IsK than C2s, even with the modest difficulty increase and better than gas huffing. C3 site payouts are typically 2 to 3x more IsK per ehp, while not requiring that much time in site either, which is well worth the extra investment to run over C2s. 
---
I already signed some of my graffiti with the name of Eve friends.
---
No one's hot to make a worldwild Eve graffiti crew? 
---
"Low Sec", best crew name ever...
---
Reading this made me realize I'm glad I quit when I did. I loved small gang combat, you could fight over customs offices and even low-tier POS's in lowsec and NPC nullsec. Me and one other guy combined our four accounts and managed to harass, steal, and hold 22 moon mining POS's with reactions for over a fucking year, even with 1 R64 moon. We did this by camping systems, killing refueling freighters as they warped from POS to POS. Running dramiels and skirting the POS tracking guns until they were low enough on ammo to attack. Getting towers to offline and stacking 4 max DPS vindicators pumping out 2.5k damage a piece right up on it. It was actually pretty impressive.  
---
We harassed some groups so much they decided to split systems with us, fearing we were much larger than we were. We managed to build quite an empire.  
---
Customs offices didn't look enticing at first, but we planted down and very few people wanted to fight over them. load of them and would often get a good bit of pocket change off of them, they're probably sitting in space still making money today.  Last time I actually got into Eve I came back from break to see a group of guys killed a handfull of my customs offices, was some of the funnest small gang fighting and harassing I had in awhile.  
---
Then citadels released... One subcap couldn't hit the astrahaus limit, and if it was fitted, the lowest tier astrahaus could lock down fucking 4 logi, which means we had to double our accounts to take out a structure... And then the 3 fucking timers.... A week of waiting... Just, no.
---
And here I thought the last op was undocking to self destruct
---
There are very good corps out there even. Issue is finding one that is SO GOOD it outweights the alliance and/or coalition it is in.
---
jags are the death of ONI
---
im pretty sure any system i go into, i create a huge drag on the server via chat. Ask anyone
---
Your guess seems pretty spot on.
---
*snicker* nice
---
Killing KT, ranking to 13/14, opening the gates to AQ40, etc was completely non-trivial in classic WoW.
---
The game was *open* to casuals, and it was significantly less harsh than Everquest, but it had a lot of fairly hardcore MMO content in both pve and pvp.
---
CCP Lebowski and a couple other guys have been fairly responsive to bug reports with wormhole problems. There are still a lot of weird bugs out there, but I’m glad we’re seeing some work on this. 
---
Isn’t it the exact opposite tho? The collectible value should go up?
---
The error message received when the network connection between client and server ("socket closed") has been updated to provide more useful information.
---
What added?  The Hamster died? 
---
And?
---
So, is SC even out or something? Is there something more than walk in a hangar now?
---
May she be at a better place with endless content
---
It's possible that somebody may have had a private conversation I'm not aware of, but 99% of the time, we share information between each other. 
---
What it means is exactly what I said - we didn't get the info ahead of time. We didn't the last time either. 
---
I don't lie to folks. 
---
There was actually a big desync test on SiSi on Tuesday or something before this happened. Better late than never. 
---
Evejobs, then prepare for week long interviews where you will be accused of being a spy, be accused of being an alt account, be accused of having to much isk, not enough isk, not enough killmails, etc etc 
---
You are definitely wrong.

---
SC isn't a game it's a tech demo that will never be finished. You all got scammed
---
not entirely sure. yes no AT means no more new AT ships but that also means that it's now just that - a collectors item or a fancy ship that you can lose and no longer provides any advantage in "competitive" side of eve - the AT.
---
[We've all been there.](https://youtu.be/1zBbt5jmGAU)
---
Yeah like this guy said. Whatever playstyle you enjoy the most. That's what you should choose.
---
Eh. With how slowly CCp actually changes things you might as well go for the FOTM since it’s going to take them a while. 
---
Lol 6 months, just sitting around making shit up today eh?
---
My dude. We didn’t kick our renters out, we replaced our former renter management with a direct rental system. We have exactly the same rental regions as we did before, there’s been zero change.
---
No one of consequence
---
I mean credit to Progod, TAPI actually managed to outlast INIT in their Northern deployment.
---
I remember CCP making a joke once that you can buy 300'000 ventures with 15$, the price of a plex on an offer or something.
---
It would have been nice if they'd specified WHAT KIND of adjustements are being made. 
---
Victory snatched from the jaws of defeat!
---
I have a higher frame rate in SC than I get in Eve. I wish I was joking :(
---
(the same could be said for any game vs Eve, my pc struggles with eve for some reason). 
---
Can I have your stuff? 
---
Exactly the point.

Put one in every system and ceptor around like everyone else does, you lazy bastard.

And explo-cans hacked!
---
Lots of research. Choosing what to invent/build takes up 80% of my industrial playtime (the rest is clicking). Looking at cost, vs price, vs volume. Is the volume high enough I can sell it in an outer region? Is it overlooked, but vital product?
---
Early on I reduced my costs by joining an indy corp - no startup cost for a new production line by copying an already researched BPO, no fully rigged tax complex. In return I do whatever small jobs they want.
---
Also expect opportunities to cycle. I was building something at 10m a profit a day, then 5m profit, today it is -3m. I'm now tracking its recovery while I work on other things.
---
Grr gns
---
I saw that and honestly it's the most exciting part of the patch notes. I know the "Eve has audio" meme is alive and well but the sounds in the game provide excellent ambiance.

It's exactly the same BR OP already posted.
---
Leader of Initiative... if that was an honest question.
---
please enlighten me with your math wizardry. 
---
ah, thanks.  i honestly didn't know =)
---
I know that it was impossible for anyone from the CSM to leak it, because we literally found out the same exact time as everyone else did, when the patch notes went live. 
---
She will be missed

If you want to amplify your performance I suggest hooking up at least three toasters in a parallel circuit to the main computer interface.
---
Why release a game when you can just be in development. No costumers No problems ...
---
Gm_CockBlocket
---
Because my suggestion would have a titan character plus titan cost the same as before, only the entire sum would be vulnerable on the field when used (which includes when they're used to rat). 
---
With your suggestion, 150bn titan cost AND the current SP cost, titans would cost even more than before, making it difficult for other groups to catch up.
---
From the AI npc ones that attack the structures?
---
Not bad at all, looks epic
---
Hakonen is a cursed system.
---
Damn 
---
Glad to see you're making use of your time while sitting on a citadel watching a domi fleet shoot your shit while feeding.
---
One sec I’ll pick one for you:
---
&gt;Fixed clipping of the Men's 'Lockstep' Boots through the Men's 'Commando' Pants.
---
Ok there you go, have fun.
---
&gt;     Fixed an issue in the physics engine with collision handling that could lead to ship position/velocity becoming desynchronised between server and clients.
---
Lies. It is not possible that after all these years this is actually fixed.
---
Sunk cost fallacy for most of them. Pity them . It is a shame that we might be in the same boat.
---
look at(ie create an excel sheet for) 
---
- profit per item
---
- profit as a % of materials
---
- volume of item sales
---
there is no point selling something at 1m isk profit per item if they only sell one a week or it it costs 100m in materials.
---
assuming you get data for every item possible, then sort your excel sheet by % profit and see which rises to the top. then work out why your data is wrong. dont trust the data. eventually you'll find one that isn't wrong. make that one.
---
Ravens?
---
I don't care for the F1 monkey tag.  I don't like PvP, so I don't go searching for it.  What I like is narrative and consequences.  That's not small gang or "cool shit", it's the big stuff with a back-story.  Even if it's a TIDI-fest I'm happy to be there if it's part of the arc of Eve.  It's why I joined Goons.  
---
come live in null, all prices are jacked up
---
Yes, definitely fuck Ark
---
See you there!
---
excel
---
Did they mean caviar?
---
Ikr either us or our allies always end up getting shit stomped when we deploy north
---
Plot twist: the spawn rate was increased
---
That's odd.   I would expect a decrease.  
---
&gt; We announced it on the **Meat show**...
---
You have my interest
---
No problem :).

---
The end of Goons online. TQ is turning into Serenity. And the number of supers is ridiculous. Just scrap Rorquels or make them actually risky to use...
---
Any broad opinion on what CCP is attempting here?
---
To help improve the health of the economy they are nerfing the respawn rates of combat anomalys. 
---
I just lost a Titan ceptor that I bought because of mild brain damage
---
Probably like "dont blame us for putting your router inside your fridge"
---
Sure but it would also be incredibly easy to defang them, whereas traditional ewar ships generally stay well out of range.
---
I remember when you destroyed our keepstar because you had beaten us so badly...
---
Oh wait.
---
I don't know how you can SC something new when most of their idea come from a 16 years old game 
---
Upvote for Chaplin meme
---
Actually pretty impressed with TAPI now. What is the world coming to :|
---
But elite had years of development time before they even announced it. SC was announced /before/ they even started development.
---
Ty!
---
We fucking annihilated the north last deployment what are you talking about lol? Now if you are referring to Hakonen specifically then yes, it is true, our track record isn’t the best.
---
It's not even a game, it's a tech demo that's been in alpha for 7 years.
---
Me likey
---
Could take a few years
---
Thanks for posting this! I have never seen a fleet act this way in video. When I read reports about 'fielding Muninns' I thought everyone was manually flying around, but this follow-the-leader behavior is really cool. Great work.
---
join a Wormhole corp you'll have more fun than you had before 
---
no, why would i?
---
every character has access to everything, it's not like i accidentally made a mage but wanted to be a warrior.
---
pewpewpew
---
I think he has.   Many larger engagements, desync losses are denied however.
---
except that last part is more than you can even do in star citizen lmao.
---
Guessing you got RMT banned?
---
Why so you can reset the timers on bots?
---
I recently decided to see how the game is as a newbro alpha and spun a new character with no handouts from my established characters...
---
The problem I found out is the massive 13 year advantage I have in the knowledge in this game more than made up for any lack of resources. I was basically able to plex to omega before I ran out of my 5mil sp cap.
---
tl;dr You can't really "start over" because your experience in this game is truly what makes you "rich"
---
Oh thanks. I missed the ping
---
We did move a couple of corporations I think when opening up a few more systems in paragon soul that were in jump range of D-P
---
... but i cant afford to loose a hundred feroxes....
---
That was September 24, 2018, so a good long while ago.
---
SP is a one off cost, so you're effectively increasing the cost anyway, especially as you can train a titan character the old-fashioned way, and have a titan for 60b or whatever.
---
So I'm not seeing much difference between increasing the cost a bit, and increasing the cost even more?
---
I mean they are fighting over a hisec market, and you can’t exactly use titans and supers up there 
---
Servers seemed to hold up though so that’s a plus 
---
UH OH. 
---
Didn't know feeding 700 bombers was "doing the lord's work" but okurr
---
how can you get a date so fast for such a change? wow.
---
Development of what? What are you referring to?
---
Hahahaha i laughed. Good meme!
---
Jesus christ
---
1) Goons and TEST takeover farmgrounds nearby.
---
2) I suggest another anom nerf is coming, and was discussed among CSM (not even suggesting a negative leak, I think alliances positioning themselves for upcoming changes is fine).
---
3) TEST/Goons: "[How dare you imply CSM leak you must hate TEST/Goons!!221!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/akny9h/the_imperium_are_taking_over_period_basis/ef6dq4y/)"
---
4) Anom nerf comes 2 months later.
---
5) Story of my life getting shat on while being right.
---
Alliance news has the dates.
---
- EWAR drones are useless (except EC-300 &amp; EC-600, [they are either  amazing or pure cancer depending on who you ask](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwzr_jieKtY))
---
- Auto-Targeting Missiles. You wold think they could be useful if you are for example jammed, but nope. They never hit the targets you actually care about and their significantly lower DPS makes them even more worthless.
---
- Smartbombs, very useful in some situations, but still very niche.
---
- Medium Autocannons are currently in a so bad spot that some people rather use Neutron Blasters on a unbonused hull then bonused ACs.
---
- Large Railguns, only worth it if you want to instantly apply damage over really long distances with specialized sniper fits. They are outperformed in all other and more commons situations by the other weapon systems.
---
PLA should work just fine, as long as you can put the paper on a slightly yielding surface, like neoprene, or a towel. 
---
I wonder what sort of resolution you could get with 3d printed block prints. 
---
It'll probably be more annoying spam that you can't turn off without turning off something else important.  Yay nerfed sound options.
---
There's no reason to, but a few I have experimented on how fast I could plex a fresh toon, best result being about 2-3 days of extreme lootwhoring in Horde.
---
Was the station a citadel/player structure? If so, Asset Safety might have been triggered, and (after some delay) the items delivered to an npc station. Not sure, but this would explain why it doesn't show in Safety (it's already in the assets tab). As long as it's waiting to be picked up, it'll sit in a Asset Safety Container in the delivery hangar.
---
No it's a npc station
---
We could put the hull cost at 100bn or whatever you deem is the same as the current hull+fit+SP cost. 
---
The point is we don't have SP cost for keepstars, do we? instead we have a juicy killmail and any alliance is free to anchor as many as they can afford, and the entire sum can be destroyed (We can go nine rounds about how easy or difficult that is though, that's not the point). The wealthy should be allowed to put their wealth on the (battle)line, but now SP is 2/3 of their wealth, and its always safe. 
---
We did destroy a keepstar. Thank you very much. 
---
Oh it'll pass after the 5th time you die because of swpping to wrong ammo, and just bring the 2-3 types you really use.
---
Great reply o7
---
it'll pass once you realize scorch is better than everything except multi 
---
In Perimeter, the setting of this thread?
---
True. But, also more the reason to start training other things while you wait.
---
Are we back to 2011?
---
Sometimes there's a bit of spinning involved, too.
---
haha. I dunno, been doing anomalies in confessor, have the staples, standard multi, xray, standard and radio, then some aurora for slapping far away targets and imp navy multi for rushing structures and what not.
---
But then I realized, I could be *more efficient.* So I picked up Ultraviolet, Infrared, Gamma and Microwave. I'm not sure I need them lol ._.
---
Yup, people are getting WAY too excited about this for no real reason. It's neat, but is EXTREMELY unlikely to ever affect EVE.  The disappointment when people eventually realize this will be real.
---
I too borked it once by trying it just before dt, frantically logging back in, luckily your ship is at the origin location then in regular space. Phew
---
About time 
---
I most definitely never worked a evening or weekend in my life, and definitely never seen a new server/host/testing happen during those times.
---
Nope, never.
---
Also definitely never seen a start up work 100hr week before either l.
---
Gotta say these other guys are right. I carry Scorch, Imp Navy Multi, and maybe some Conflag if there's a big slow BS or a structure to bash. Otherwise the tracking hit is too harsh to bother with Conflag in most cases.
---
All those other flavors are pointless. You switch to one because it's optimal for 25 meters, and then you switch to another because now they're 26 meters away. =) 
---
Perimeter keep is ded?
---
what is it?
---
That's not you being an industrialist, that's you being a market troll. As said above, if you sold the minerals you would make more money so you're essentially paying to fuck with the market. You are definitely not an industrialist but hey, you do you I suppose. 
---
Was actually quite fun. No politics etc to worry about. Just spaceships and pew pew pew pew
---
High sec is safe if you put missiles and neuts on it and dont bling the modules 
---
Low is fairly not safe i would not try it. Territory or not low is more populated than youd like to drop a solo raitaru.
---
I mean for PVP things I agree with you, scorch and multi. But I'm not even using pulse, and this is PVE lol.
---
Can confirm that this was not discussed with the CSM.
---
Now the bp might have been used remotely by a citadel at the time and had been taken down.
---
Thanks 
---
Well perhaps my perspective is a little bit distorted, as INIT routinely use CMDs in out fleets, and if you're in a destroyer in a 0.0 fleet, then equipping defenders is very good idea if you don't want to get the everliving shit bombed out of you.
---
Well the ECM bursts are hugely more efficient for that, but the 3 150mm ACs add a little extra DPS so why not?
---
Imagine taking a "NOMAD" alliance, and doing this with it. 
---

Yeah.  The only good training is ghost training, amirite?

---
You are seriously overestimating the impact of alpha mission runners on the economy of even meta items, and also neglecting the fact that meta 4 also comes in decent quantities from nullsec. Except some turrets that just refuse to drop.
---
You could probably compress quite a bit of that in various clever ways.
---
Guess its finally time to teach myself powerquery then.
---
Its more a reflection of the current state of the game than a reflection of inits capabilities
---
Does it happen? Sure. 
---
Does it happen like that when "not like that" is a viable option?
---
It's almost like the world doesn't revolve around players in the US or something.
---
Torpedoes?? Unless you plan on doing bombers. It's not needed. or running lvl 4 missions with a Golem.
---
I made my first main at the age of 12 - it had some stupid shit said on the character name as I was of course in middle school.
---
sold the character, but later started again and went back into null with different company and a mix of industry, marketing, etc instead of just purely pvp. 
---
The hard reset and new experiences have been pretty refreshing so far. 11 years and there's still stuff I'm learning
---
No, not at all. I have an alt in horde for funding other ventures and cheap pvp. Their doctrine fits are low SP and cheap; no one has ever extorted me... taxes are high, but you get tons of free/cheap services and infrastructure for it.

---

---
All weapons have some use in some situations. However, if you never plan to be in some situations, then some weapons will indeed become worthless. 
---
For example: Unless you plan to use Stealth Bombers, Torpedoes are almost useless.
---
Defender Missiles, are almost useless unless you plan to specifically fly a fleet doctrine that uses them within a fleet.
---
Missiles and drones are good to train for general use and small fleet stuff. They are flexible and do not use capacitor which is very important for PvE as well as for players who have not trained full capacitor skills yet, as well as weapon support skills which reduce its use. Missiles and drones kinda suck in big lag and tidi situations in comparison with turrets.
---
As far as turrets go, my personal opinion knowing what I know now, is that for a new player Projectile Turrets are best to train. My reasons are as follows: 
---
They don't use capacitor - extremely important for new and lower trained skill players
---
They have all damage types available - extremely important as this allows you to adapt to various situations very fast, on the fly by simply loading up different ammo you can carry with you.
---
Auto Cannons have best falloff in the game among short range turrets - this is very important as you do not have to fit additional +range modules for them to be effective, unlike with other short range turrets. They have lower tracking, but due to their range it is easier to "string" your opponents thus making the lower tracking irrelevant, whereas in weapons such as blasters, you do not have this option unless you fly a ship with +range bonus on hull or sacrifice a module slot or two for it.
---
Nothing like a decade long alpha test.

This isn't really a game where you generally "kick ass".  You may wanna read up more on what EVE is, because it kind of sounds like you're setting yourself up to fail.

That has seen a massive amount of develpment on the way, but lets ignore all that

Nice! thats alot of fine detail for that stage/material. Im sure it looks much more 3d IRL.

---
New kid implies SC actually exists. It doesn't. We don't hate SC because we think it will succeed, it's because we can already see it has failed. If anyone knows scams, it is EvE players, and SC is one of the biggest scams going.
---
F bro
---
This wasn't it's finest quality, could print it better but as I was only testing I couldn't justify the 24hours it would have taken on it's finest. The idea of it is to block out light on dark spots so really it's flat and boring untill you put it over and light source! 
---
So when are they reimbursing the Komodo?
---
When they announced the first set of respawnd timer changes, they also stated more would come. Nothing shocking there that a few months later more changes came. It could be csm leaks or it could just be that alliance readers were already preparing. 
---
Are you that intentionally dumb or just naive?
---
Yeah but it would be more difficult to make skins for those.
---
My goodness people. He's carrying aurora; he's using beams. The man cannot use scorch/conflag.
---
Using lots of different crystals in beams is an important  part of getting the most out of the weapon system.
---
At least Ark has relatively good modding support.
---
&gt; no one has ever extorted me... taxes are high
---
lmbo
---
"Do you have a preferred target?"
---
"Just bomb them all. This system belongs to us."
---
"Yes commander."
---
I'm saying it's a niche case yes, it's not going to work unless the situation is set up either with a fleet, or with support tackle. Arty nags need to be at 100km and also get a bit lucky but it can be done fairly reliably as long as you have a dual web tackle cruiser (ashimmu for example)
---
at this point you're being a retard for the sake of proving how disabled you are
---
Why? Gleam+Multi+Standard+Aurora covers basically all use cases with beams.
---
Back when I was in an alliance leadership position folks would sell minerals and resources to me at a certain percentage of Jita Buy because I would save them the time of having to get their materials JF'd (plus the JF costs on top of that made it even worse.)  Buying minerals at 80-85% of Jita gives you a lot of room to work with on your pricing, the negative is that you then have to move your own saleable assets if the area you're building in doesn't also have a group of buyers for what you are selling.

---
CCP puts the AD in ADventure....just maximize your launcher to full screen in 4k res for the glorious experience.  
---
I got the same thing and all I could think was all the times I got killed regardless of wars going on.
---
I knew you were using Beams when I saw Aurora.
---
But Pulse are better for PvE because your Beams become useless if they get too close. Whereas you can use a scripted Tracking Computer and Scorch to hit long range targets, and still have effective defense up close.
---
Beams are basically only good for kiting snipers and distant structure bashing. =) 
---
Could ya'll have some commitment please? I just moved a bunch of my ships to fight ya. 
---
lol i feel that. Without being pedantic, what do you typically carry?
---
Go big or go home. Or go big and go home. Second one is more accurate for PGLs northern excursion.
---
Here you go, 2 simplistic fits. Feel free to make changes to them, but be mindful of shield regeneration rates. These are assuming level 5 weapon skills as well as support skills such as PG, CPU, shield, etc. Also, you will have to use Precision ammo for extra small targets. So you have to switch ammo between High Damage, and Precision as needed, including mid combat. 
---
The Drake has only **Kinetic** damage bonus, whereas the Navy Drake bonus is for all missile types. Keep that in mind its very important. If you want more tank on the Navy Drake, take out the MJD and put in another shield extender. If you want better shield resistances, then scale down the shield extenders from Tech II down to Regolith, and see if you can fit a Shield Command module with appropriate charge.
---
These are only templates. In general Heavy Assault Missiles give you much better DPS but at short range, Heavy Missiles will give you range but lower DPS. Feel free to switch them around as you please.

No, CCP make the rules. And CCP could make it so having a big stick doesn't create a zero-content umbrella zone. My argument is that they should do that because having 90% of Eve being a no-content zone is not good for the game.

This seems like quite the half measure. Granted. I'm a long-gone bittervet who hasn't logged in for years, but am I not correct in assuming that any corp with some ambition kinda needs structures to....do stuff? Last time I was in game, not having structures limited you to pretty much missions, low-efficiency mining and incursions. And most people who only wanted to do that just stayed in the NPC corps and were safe from decs there anyway. 
---
/u/penifsmash this guy is ISRAD material.
---
 Yup not what I wanted not coming back
---
Nice. 
---
Corps can use others' structures to a high level now, meaning high sec corps without structures can still do a lot. This helps to protect corps from "griefing" when they're too small/new/inactive to maintain structures. Lowers the barrier to joining a corp for the new and risk averse. 
---
Yeah I’m guessing it sounds better on paper than it is. They even call out having fun in high-sec, but IMO the game starts once you leave it. You’re still right that if you want high efficiency you gotta be out there “risking” it in some way. 
---
20km (scripted) vs 57km (scripted)?
---
I think we have different opinions of what is considered long range, my friend!
---
&gt; Fly Safe!
---
Look how they massacred my boy
---
Yeah that's pretty much what I was running for a while (although, I threw in radio so I wouldn't burn through my aurora so fast.)
---
Or just join Horde.
---
in the overwiew settings, tab presets tab, celestial drop down, check "agents in space" and "beacon" then the site the agent is in will show up on the ov and you can warp to him then right click the agent in ov to talk to him so you dont need to have the agency open 
---
Nothing on cap rebalance and various related or alike changes :(
---
very disappointed
---
thanks buti found it in the agency  
---
tldr: NOTHING CHANGED
---
Y’all need to watch that diet or you’ll end up like us down in Delve 
---
Or reflection of inits commitment. Goons showed it can be done 
---
No Structures = No War = Fly Safe~ish because you can still get ganked if you fly something stupid expensive.
---
Mostly bug fixes which is good but not dramatic. Good move taking high level missions out of the alpha account abusing botters' repertoire - next stop is surely stopping alphas effectively using VNIs and Gilas (no heavy drone skills, no cross-faction ships allowed).
---
Keep the nullsec farming nerfs coming until the economy gets somewhere near balance, please. And ore anomalies too.
---
Here it is. It's a passive fit that's designed to orbit around a mobile depot to refit the lows to more/less tank as rats get killed. 
---
https://i.imgur.com/HmUM7zH.png
---
There are better Gila fits, and a passive fit rattlesnake are far better for C3s, but this is a somewhat cheap fit that gets the job done. You can drop some of the shield regen lows for more drone damage mods, and do an active hardeners for C2s. 
---
What on Earth are you drinking? Have you watched any of RexZilla's videos? SC is way past a "tech demo" at this point. I suppose you are not aware that the second landable planet which is akin to Coruscant will be released in the next patch later this month? They also just showed us the cave tech they plan to implement for planets/moons which is incredibly cool.
---

---
It depends on the ship.
---
For beams I will always carry gleam, multi, gamma, x-ray, UV, standard and Aurora.
---
Some ships like the retri I'll swap Aurora for faction microwave since it gets lower optimal range and better tracking (because the retribution lock range prevents using Aurora) 
---
Aurora does do more dps, so Aurora is still handy to have if you're sniping large ships like cruisers from 40-50km.
---
I generally don't carry radio or microwave, the damage is too low for me to even bother with. It takes 3 ticks to get a crystal switch off, and it's often better to use your time piloting to get in range of one crystal as opposed to correcting your crystal to your range.
---
*Eyy, another year! * It's your **1st Cakeday** _mewash_! ^(hug)
---
The access control list mechanism actually makes this a lot easier now, you can effectively have near admin over a structure you don't own. 
---
Just rent the office again and they will be back
---
&gt;Or reflection of inits commitment. Goons showed it can be done 
---
As long as you bring 600 titans
---
That's okay. I'm really good at feigning indifference at petty nonsense that keeps me awake at night.
---
999 killmark limit literally unplayable
---
Can’t offices are full
---
If the player corp you are in (or the alliance that your corp is in, if the corp is in an alliance) do not own any structures then nobody can declare war against that corp (or alliance).
---
Of course, you can still he killed in high sec by ganking or by people tricking you into going suspect etc but as a tl;dr if a corp owns so structures it's safe from war decs
---
Herding 1.4k lemmings into actually doing anything as a group is damn impressive.
---
 The Watchtower organization of the Jehovah's Witnesses is a non-Christian cult.
---
Heavy missiles aren't useful for much. Apart from that they all have their uses, it's more about what type of thing you like flying.
---
You can train everything to III or IV in a short time, and only train up to T2 in the things you enjoy using.
---
Well i dont know any workaround. 
---
Some time ago this happened to us and i thought we had lost the entire corp bpo collection.. then i rented the office again and there they were. But if you cant rent again have no idea how to solve this
---
we had a corp ping to shitpost/upvote jokes on you dude

Blops 5 is 99% niche as both 3 and 4 is sufficient for the cloaky warp.

Ah okay, thanks!  I think I understand now.

"fly safe"
---
*looks at all the "fly safe" corpses in Uedama and Niarja*
---
tldr of what this means is. if you dont have a structure, they can't war dec you, which means they cant freely engage you in highsec without concord.
---
Are you suggesting you wouldn't be able to scan down a signature because a mobile scan inhibito is anchored close to it? Are you suggesting if someone anchored a mobile scan inhibitor 10kms off a wormhole for example, that you wouldn't be able to scan it down? If not, then I'm really not understanding what you mean by it could "affect" core probes. In what way would it affect core probes?
---

I lived in Dronelands when they first opened; on the one hand, it was relaxing, we had fights when we wanted and minerals when we didn't. Caps were fairly rare, and you could have a reasonably fun corp outing hauling Freighters of Passive Targeter Is out to reprocess and mix with drone poop to make ships. Was pretty cashpoor, other than corp mineral bounties &amp; hauling the occasional drop out.
---
FC, can I bring a drake?
---
Ponzi had some damn good investment opportunities, didn't he?
---
can we ban this bot?
---
Also Goonswarm vs. Requiem Eternal would be an even fight because it's 1v1.
---
Won’t these fits have trouble maintaining cap because of neuts? Or can you kill the neuting rats before they start causing real trouble?
---
if elite players constantly gank people doing pve activities they will eventually not have any shiny ships to shoot.
---
you mean people unironically run abyssal sites without a cloaked alt near the hole?
---
When it comes to hulls, it's more competitive to be in a null bloc.  You're right where the vast majority of minerals are being produced with huge output which means prices are lower.  It's extremely difficult for Rorquals to operate effectively outside of capital umbrellas so the more dense the space, the lower the mineral price (usually).  In null you can get minerals anywhere from 100% of the Jita BUY value all the way down to as low as 70% from what I've seen. What's more, hulls have a mark up in null compared to Jita.  However, doctrine hulls are a saturated market, it would likely make more sense to produce something that has decent volume for the space it's in.
---
When talking about supers and titans, you need capital.  Lots of capital.  Supercarriers aren't so bad, but titans sure can be.  You need lots of minerals, you need money for the inputs like blueprints and for a titan a blueprint pack (hull + capital components) can be quite expensive.  The install costs will run a few billion for a titan, too.  If you're doing your own mining, there's fuel, tax, and refine costs.  It might be worthwhile investing in your own BPOs, but for supers and titans this investment is extraordinarily expensive with long timelines to pay for themselves.
---
“The CCP Team is beginning to grow again” That’s a good sign I guess, happy to hear something like that.
---
the people it's benefiting are highsec players with corps that are too new to have ambitions yet. that way they get time to grow and organize before putting down the structures that make them war-eligible.
---
alternately, people who just want to run missions and mine but want a social group with it.
---
well, I wish my corp mate had jabber open in the first place x"D
---
Considering the speed of some of these updates, is CCP round responsible for the extra 0 on the end of how many years it takes?
---
Make sure the sound makes it next time. Videos are more interesting with comms too, you can split the audio using something like VoiceMeeter Banana or Virtual Audio Cable. Then you can mix the comms audio into the video real time or just edit in parts of it. Also lets you speed up the video while keeping the audio at normal speed, if you don't include all of the audio ([like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=820soKC1ucM)). If you don't want the hassle of splitting the audio you can still speed the video up and slow it down when something important happens ([like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nrIcP_jheQ)).
---
Bottom line, EVE is pretty boring to watch at normal speed unless you're commenting on what's going on.
---
Keep it up though.
---
Regardless, you are creating content and leaving your home field advantage to do it. Props to you and thank you for making eve fun again these past few weeks.
---
Lol live it
---
Star Citizen has already fatigued out. Nobody GAF anymore except for the idiots who have $2500+ already invested. They don't have a choice. The Chris Roberts trial is getting closer.
---
Wtf a couple of structures get reinforced and and it's enough for Init run away home?
---
Finally, an /r/eve that isn’t a 900 word diatribe about how “one easy fix can change the game”
---
Remeber what happened last time you got this delusional
---
Great stuff. This game at 10 years old gets better and more frequent updates than some new games. (Looking at you BFV)
---
That is exactly what i'm wondering about - if the "object" includes signatures. That means can a scan inhib hide a sig, which, as i understand, is what op is asking. Wh is a great example. And you would be able to combat probe the inhib, but not the sig. If it works it has uses in hisec where sigs are highly contested. Scan inhibs are expensive tho.
---
Alright, i'm gonna say this one time, if i hear of your corp brigading reddit threads, or try to vote manipulate in any way, i'll ban your entire corp. Ask Am0k.
---
Ok.....

looks caldari?

I don't know if it "works best" with faces, so much as humans have an extraordinary ability to piece together faces.

There are a lot more greebles that give it a bit of Minmatar flair, but it really does have a strike resemblence to the new Osprey hull models.

Apples to oranges indeed, because TAPI have gone home, but Harkonen is now our 3rd staging point for the forseeable future.

Would this be the type of thing a mod would assist with? Does it count as a bug?
---
CCP finally listened to people pointing out the negative effects of the war declaration mechanic on new player retention and developed a roadmap for fixing those issues. The fist step done in December (the "no structures = no war"-part) was essentially a hot-fix against groups specified in grieving newbro corps for no other reason then to collect easy kills. What it means: as long your corp doesn't own any structures (citadels, ECs, refineries, POCOs, etc) you can't get a war declaration. Its essentially a very basic compromise between protecting newbros and still give people the ability to destroy highsec structures if they want/need.
---

Did two quick clears of havens on SiSi.

Respawn timer seems to now be around 15-16 minutes up from 10 minutes pre-patch.

That's not really our style though.

LOL. I've seen this repost since 1920
---
Eve knows your shame. 
---
I swear it isn't what it looks like!
---
What content is skippable that didn't used to be in eve?
---
Upventured. 
---
The stock prices are just a "caldari flavor" bit of worldbuilding. It contains caldari npc corps and some prominent caldari roleplayer corp tickers.
---
These are passive shield regen. You only need cap for prop and shield hardener, and you don't have to run both at the same time. Also, target priority is a thing. If you have super low cap skills where even these give you trouble you will have problems no matter what, go do lower content until your cap skills are sufficient then come back.
---
Is that a beam confessor ? If so it’s good, only problem is using t1 amo over navy. You could probably get rid of infrared tbh unless for some other reasons you really want that range. In general the reasonable but flexible set is : short range and long range T2, peak short range faction (multifreq), point kiting range (gamma or xray depending on fit and preference), low cap consumption (standard), long range high tracking (microwave or radio)
---
People had fun? Oh shit, better shut down the fun because crabs have nightmares about stuff blowing up!

Holy cow.  That fight was dead even on the isk.  Great fights for both sides.   Well done!

come to uedama in your freighter if you have any cojones

The same thing that happened to the Imicus redesign, the angel capitals and shield slaves: soon™
---
I know, right? I always laugh when they act like getting that many guys in one place at one time is easy. 
---
you mean you don't stalk the main ccp devs?
---
Damn that model looks sick
---
hearing big names leave one after another makes certainly made it feel like eve was dying. hopefully they make some good additions
---
I turned audio off back when Aura replaced whatsername, and was telling us that we were out of range of crap, and how to get a new ship after you lost one, etc.  After they fixed that I couldn't figure out how to get her back on... but to be fair, I didn't work at it very hard.
---
It got trashed.
---
To be fair you can do that on any toon.

 Makes sense as theyre not mainline skill reqs, i.e. frig-cruiser-battleship

nah it was a joke :p

I did just recently after returning from winning eve for two years. Brain drained my main, injected to 20m to give me a good starting base and sold the rest of the injectors. Then I started playing. It was / has been fun as I made a point of doing the things I previously hadn't in my previous eve career.
---
But it's also been hard and sad for a few reasons:
---
Seeing old friends or people I knew but not talking to them because I am a different character now.
---
Being used to having a 100m Sp and taking a lot of skills for granted. I just completed a single racial cruiser V which felt amazing. Funny as I used to have all subs to V.
---
Hard because I played for so long as a small gang pilot in a specific region of space. I want to return to that and the groups I was with because it's what I know and liked. Bloc warfare sucks, tidi is soul crushing and super proliferation blah blah blah. It's not for me yet here I am in a big alliance. 
---
Over all I don't regret starting over. It's made me really appreciate what I have. It's also been fun as eve is literally a blank slate once again. Try it? 
---
Those INIT guys should come and join Provi-bloc, daily fights and amarr victor memes, we even fight people with sub capitals other than bombers!
---
Yeah it was a first try, it was mostly made for corp member and decide to show it on reddit, but yeah I will definetly work on it next time, also my bad german friend is also taking video with voice and have way better editing skill than I, so get ready to see the round 2 soonTM :D
---
lol record for short deployment winning by Inititive now ? 
---
No way. My characters took forever to get right I dont want to do it again
---
I'm gonna start off with a context dump.    
---
   
---
I just started playing less than a week ago. I ended up meeting a dude who was wanting to start a Corp(he's been playing for about a year and footed all the startup costs himself), we got along so i figured what could it hurt to join. I'm his 1st member,  I knew this up front. We just got our 3rd member a couple days ago. We have a Corp HQ at up inside an npc station with corporate hangars. We are aiming for an industry focused corp. However, there is a clear lack of direction. No real plan or structure as far as I can tell. Now, I'm ok with this, I understood what I was signing up for. The corp leader is still learning the mechanics of running the corp. (For example, it took him a while to figure out how to set up my access rights to the hangars). And that's fine too, I don't mind a slow start and I've been free to just sort of do my own thing,  learning the game.    
---
           
---
Ok,  here's my question. What can I do to help us get this corp off the ground? It's obvious my corp leader has zero experience and is learning the 101s of running a Corp as we go. I want to be helpful in getting this Corp up and running in a meaningful way. Because so far it's been little more than a lower tax rate, a convenient share hangar, and a buddy to chat with while I'm doing whatever.      
---
Quality stuff
---
oh nice
---
They dont send any to me :(
---
Thank my Lord and savior Mister Bliss for saving cloud ring from the dangerous and menacing factional warfare pvpers, now i can get back to krabbing in peace.

I'm not talking about hull design, When I hear "Oooooh you can buy ore in one place and sell for even more in another place because they don't have that kind of ore there, it's fucking crazy, that was never made before"(heard on a SC top streamer) but yeah that was in eve online for how many years ? 
---
Whats the stance of eve lore/law on chemical weapons like this? 
---
I like that Init. can actually get shit done without goons. oh wait...
---
Ok.
---

Haha this is as funny as dinosaur pictures
---

---
Ehhh how bout no!

put the structures in the alt corp
---
I really want to see an Eve ship like the heavy crusiers from Homeworld. Those things were nuts.
---
We didn't even "prepare" for this nerf, is the thing. Period Basis is renter space. Imperium line members can't krab there at all.
---
eve player base has gone down over the past 6 years form topping 50,000 on weekends to topping maybe 23,000. Eve also allows non paying people to play so... yea is will die at this rate in 3 years.
---
The rust is only on the surface and doesn't really affect the performance. If Amarr develops a solution to duck tape or someone figures out how to activate salvage modules on active ships then Minmatar pilots have a problem.
---
I read "triglavian capital" and instantly had a no-hands orgasm.

This is a great idea because it helps discourage those types of bots. One less place CCP has to play whack-a-mole. Go away.

I have been playing this game since 07 and fit squarely into your bittervet description but you better believe I file for SRP whenever possible. Never leave money on the table

I got my SC refund last year and bought some PLEX with it. I was turned off by all of the hyping and fundraising and redesigning ships they already sold for a game that doesn't exist yet.

---
I hope this never hits Tranquility, the old Thrasher is so much better. Why can't they do a remodel without doing a full redesign?
---
Tis. I think I might trim out some of the crystals, back down to what I had, but maybe tweak a bit.
---
Been doing some highsec exploration, man this thing is the bee's knees. 100-200m/hr (real income) flitting around. I have tuned my fit so hard I don't think I can make it any better without changing to a different ship, and I don't think changing to a different ship would be faster/better.
---
I made over 500mil my first week of playing eve doing exploration, what plex difficulties are you talking about? It’s still possible regardless of the missions, even FW is easy money..
---
 if you mine it it is free! 
---
so was Chimera....
---
It’s also easy to pick a non-toxic subreddit but here we both are lol

No. Why wouldn't they create more incentives to sub? It should have been this way from the  beginning.

Olmeca still trying to remain relevant here have a daily get fucked and a downvote

It depends : what do you want to do ?

You can mine in venture

---
Do PvP in faction cruiser
---
Fly no ship in Jita ( or Perimeter )

What do you mean Low Class? If you cant have kitty ears you cant have NPC bathroom humor either.

EVE isn't dying because new people like me are getting into the game every day! Help folks find the fun in this game and it'll live on for decades to come.
---
&gt; Chimera....
---
Do people even know it exists? Because I don't think I've ever seen one in the wild.
---
Delet C4
---
they sent emails pretty often, nothing special
---
Can you elaborate on "Fly no ship in Jita"?  So, faction fitted pirate BS is flyable my an Alpha clone?  I read T2 weapon systems are locked, but not sure what other T2 modules are off limits...
---
r/woooosh
---
Thankfully
---
They moved the undock button at some point.
---
We should go back to 14-Day trials. 
---
I wish we could play in his version of eve tbh
---
Don't be naive, these bots will just return on Lvl 3 missions.
---
I would prefer kestrel redesign first. I like how kestrel looks at the moment but I think it could be made to look more like the other new caldari ship designs.
---
nobody does c4 sites anyway, rip
---
I think the grey colour does it. Make it brown and it would look convincingly minmatar, similar to the rupture T2 hulls in style, I reckon.
---
It looks like a ship getting mounted by another ship... 
---
They know you're a brave goon who hasn't seen high-sec in ~~months~~ years.
---
they would be pretty clutch in C3s and C2s.

Lvl 4 missions should by all means be considered core PVE content in this game. It has always been that way and it certainly hasn't diminished for alpha's since they have been given access to battleships.  
---
Which is less isk/hr than level 4s and 5s and lessens the isk faucet impact of mission bots on the economy. Thanks for agreeing.
---
same
---
I was in high sec last night :(
---
no it's been a few years since I've tried.
---
How so? (I just started playing less than a week ago, so I know nothing)
---
In case you have been living under a rock, subscription models have been in steady decline in games for a while now and Eve is no exception to that.
---
It's the very reason why alpha's were created in the first place. If anything, CCP should expand on their F2P model if they want a healthy future for this game. Subs are simply not cutting it anymore as a sole business model.
---
You can fly all t1 subcaps, t2 small and medium guns. 
---
Yeah. Its IMHO one of the worst decisions CCP made when redesigning and rebalancing frigates. The Maulus is one of the most beautiful and iconic spaceship I've ever seen in a sci-fi IP, yet it is one of the most rare model you end up seeing in New Eden. Meanwhile one of the ugliest models was chosen for a ship that a huge majority of new players will fly, the Imicus. The old model of the Helios was based on the Maulus and I wished they woud have sticked with it. Hell that would make me reconsider flying covops (even though they are garbage) if CCP would decide to say fuck it and swich the Imicus/Helios model with the Maulus/Keres model.
---
Also yes, the Celestis is so ugly I don't even want to think about it. EVE needs only one bananaboat and the Oracle does a great job being that. There is no need for this misshapen abomination of a banana called Celestis/Arazu/Lachesis to exist in this game.

That would be the absolute fastest way to turn this game into a hardcore-only graveyard.

This is baffling because I've run eve on a laptop that's basically a toaster attached to a potato battery.

Maybe it's a graphics driver thing? Some computers have issues with eve's clouds and bloom effects.

Dear diary,

Another new update for this month coming soon. Still no Stain gate though. I am quite saddened, but hopeful for next month.

Yes.

I will never forgive them for what they did to my beautiful Chimera &gt;;\[ wish they had an option for older models
---
I still hold INIT highly, especially when compared with other null groups, I hope they can find a happy medium between defending their space and projecting out. Fountain seems to be such a historically cursed region for it and it'd be a shame for the game as a whole if they don't break the trend.
---
Jump into a wormhole and do C3s if you want lower-skill, decent-paying battleship combat sites.
---
I will never forgive them for what they did to my beautiful Chimera! Iwish they had an option for older models. I refuse to use the abomination of a redesign
---
Sure but that doesn't stop botting. If anything, hackers will even use more bots to keep up their ISK/hr.
---
On the other hand, this limitation does really screw over alpha's who enjoy missioning to finance their other Eve activities.

With skill injectors the only hard limit is your skill and knowledge as a player. Thankfully Eve is an MMO that largely encourages team play.

The way your miners died yesterday would also be a good indicator of the state of Pandemic Horde though. (+_+)

&gt;What if we got a thrasher and glued it to the top of a Jackdaw?
---
I mean, if panfam thinks their supers getting hellcamped is fun, im down for round 2
---
It could be a driver issue, I'll double check when I'm back from visiting family.
---
Honestly for about 20 minutes after loading into Eve I get about 5-15fps with regular stalls, which can be re-triggered whenever I check my eve mails.
---
Just typing a fresh mail will lag the FPS down, though it seems to be processor based as what I type will still go in to the box after it comes out of a stall. 
---
But what if CCP Falcon is my pet bear???
---
In b4 the new complaints of “small alliances can’t raise isk because no space! Can’t afford ships AND plex!” Lol.
---
Disclaimer I’m not for or against the nerfs I just think this will hurt the smaller guys worse per usual. It’s the crow that crows that gets eaten.
---
&gt; If anyone knows scams, it is EvE players, and SC is one of the biggest scams going.
---
And credit where it's due, SC is much larger scam than anything pulled in EVE will ever be. 
---
Why don't hackers use more bots right now if they're able to?
---
If you have a fight in wormhole space with 20 people in each fleet, expect the server to freak the hell out when everyone starts bumping.

This is true
---
Don't fucking touch the Sabre hull.
---
Thanks man but according to their Reddit page they shut up shoo 6 months ago
---
i dont think it will. Most of the "smaller guys" dont rely heavily on rorquals and supers.
---
Smaller groups, atleast when i was running one, relied on moon mining ops (250mil/hr per covetor where we were), highsec incursions and random isk making activities in our pocket (diving WH's, DED sites, scams).
---
Most small groups log in to PVP, not log in to PVE. The guys that want to PVE join huge alliances because of their swaths of safe space. Guys in smaller groups (Tri, skill u, etc) log in to kill shit. They have alts for the isk making, but dont rely on rorqual mining and super ratting. Those just so happen to be the laziest ways to make isk.
---
If they nerf rorqs/supers, that would actually be a huge boosts for groups that make large amounts of isk in a short amount of time or plex.
---
From my own experience: Running lvl4s is one of the most apparently desirable paths newbros aspire to. I know because I've gone down this rabit hole in my past and so did many of the pilots I had contact with. And its a god dammed trap. Lets be honest, missions in EVE are absolute garbage and running them is a sure way to get burn out and eventually quit, ether temporally or permanently. Forcing alphas to seek other revenues of making ISK is a good thing for newbros in my opinion.
---
&gt; which can be re-triggered whenever I check my eve mails.
---
Ok, that's super interesting. 
---
Have you tried clearing your eve cache? It might be that your log files or something are super huge and that's causing system slowdown as it tries to read it. 
---
Are you rich tho?
---
Oh I see. You merged teh 2 sound into the who and made it one word. Neato. 
---
Many times over the years, it's been a persistent thorn in my foot for a fairly long time :(
---
I'm sure they will be back soon.  If you can't take care of home, why deploy anyway?
---
Im pretty sure this is going to feel nothing like eve in the slightest 
---
Geez, sorry dude. Best of luck in fixing it though.

---
Thanks, if I remember I'll let you know how the driver check goes. o7 might take a recording just to show folks what my eve experience has been like for the past year or two. 
---
1. Join a group asap. It can be a corporation (see r/evejobs) , or a channel ([here's a list from another post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/8fuo96/ingame_mailing_lists_and_channels/)).    
---
2. Ask questions and participate. Fastest way to learn is to try. And for PvP that means dying.    
---
3. If you don't like what you're doing, stop what you're doing. If you don't like who you're with, stop being with them. At the end of the day this is a game, if your corp sucks then leave it and join another.    
---
4. Try everything at least once. Solo, smallgang, big fleets, TiDi-fests. Industry, trading, exploration, ganking, shitposting.     
---
Because all 200 are coders. Yeah.
---
True
---
WTF is that? Looks like something those dirty Caldari would design. Not a speck of rust?
---
Why aren't they bad though? I'm genuinely asking. 
---
and if you want to own structures just have some in a holding corp
---
Has there been one single update to this game that you actually like?
---

---
Good deal. I like to accumulate random trouble-shooting tips for eve since it tends to be very hard to figure that stuff out on your own. 
---
I kind of like the little fish look of the thrasher
---
They must have evidence that most whales are from high sec.  They know their target market!
---
&gt; looks sick
---
Yeah, like it came down with ebola.
---
Agreed. 
---
The lag between opening the first and subsequent ones is terrible as well. I can deal with the "ads" that people are complaining about (even though those were there on the old one too). I think one of the biggest issues of the current launcher though is that it still launches EVE instead of some better game.
---

I agree, this post is a waste of pixels 
---
When Fozzie promises it in a devblog?
---
There are plenty of players that enjoy them, like the monotomy of mining is enjoyed by many. Taking lvl 4 missions away and forcing players into other activies does nothing to help alpha players. If anything, it will only annoy them, especially as they feel robbed from an income source that can finance their other Eve (PVP) activities.
---
Does that mean that lvl 4 missions leave a lot of room for improvements? Absolutely, but taking them away is not the solution. Making them better is.
---
Not much point to flying it right now, at least outside of large fleets.
---
Similar to archon, the lack of dig hurts. But archon at least has slaves
---
All they need to do is - - -
---
It would appear they just tried a last stand and fed 35 billion in 9GI.   
---
God's work. Lol.
---
I got bored before I could even run level 2 missions. Not to mention, wouldn't an alpha still be able to fly a gila and do t3 abyssals?
---
Sadly ill be at work at that time, otherwise id come.
---
It's fucking terrible and looks like two junkyard piles having buttsex, that's what happened.
---
They are likely to use as many bots to at least fulfill their ISK needs. Which means that with Lvl 3 missions they will even use more bots. Or even worse, they will Plex their bot accounts and use more lvl 4 bots to compensate for the Plex.
---
Any recommendations for a wormhole exploration combat ship? I'm simply looking to do the anomaly combat sites and the sig combat sites. I was just in a class 2 wormhole and got spanked proper in a Perimeter Hangar site. I was flying a RLML Legion with drones and the Sleeper Watchman battleship was hitting me for around 500 a pop. This was only the 2nd wave too.

---
Because time maths is hard.
---
That’s not quite right. If you build something for less than you could have sold the minerals for it effectively costs you money
---
That's simply not how it works, especially in world were 90% of humanity is risk-averse.  
---
You simply can't force players into some play style, especially in Eve where freedom of how you play is one of its most praised qualities. 
---
&gt;  I got my SC refund last year
---
Wait, is that an option? I didn't put much in but I'd love to get it back!
---
Considering this change coincides with a "change to nullsec anomaly spawn rates"; it could be that CCP is trying to slow the isk faucets a bit.  Denying 4 and 5 missions to alphas could be part of the same effort.  Just speculation though.
---
Rattles use cruise iirc
---
That's actually a configuration option. By default it's 2 seconds between each client.
---
unless Dunk Dinkle shows up with his ***sack, bag, valise or whatever of friendship*** and it all gets reversed 
---
All the info is pretty good. Auto targeting missiles I used to use on an alt when I would rat with two accounts. Assign drones to main and f1 autocruise. Now though it’s prob easy to spin to vnis 
---
Most people dont really bot large-scale to "fulfill their ISK needs"...
---
but does it matter in eve if your afk most of the time? thats how eve players think
---
Well, the Init raven fleet is now a hell of a lot closer to God.
---
The answer will surprised you
---
&gt;fulfill their ISK needs
---
Their needs are rubles and yuan... don't be naive.
---
As someone who came back a few months ago after an 8 year hiatus, my main recommendations would be:
---
1) Keep google at the ready, and be ready to search for answers to things you don’t understand. Eve Uni’s wiki is one of the best sources that has been kept up to date, but you still may have to dig elsewhere for some things. 
---
2) Don’t sweat it by trying to play perfect at first. I struggled with this when I first started playing, and I struggled with it when I came back. I’d spend forever agonizing over a fit, or trying to min/max a way of making Isk before even dipping my toe in and trying it. Be willing to take a bit of risk. Also be willing to get out and try things, instead of worry about ways you could be doing it 10% better. At least at first. 
---
3) Find a group! Others have touched on it, and I agree. Don’t be afraid to leave a group if you’re not sure either. I’m glad I was picky and didn’t tough it out with the first group I joined. 
---
4) Approach EVE like you’re new, and remember that that’s ok. Pretty much all the classic advice people give new players applies to returning players. Respect that EVE is a complex game that you won’t master right away, and then don’t just tolerate that fact, but embrace it and enjoy it! It’s why most people start playing this game.

Restricting alpha's is a bad idea for a game who's future is so reliant on player numbers. And no, this will not help against botters. At all.

Unlike for example mining, which is done semi afk, lvl4s are probably the most grindy experience you can find in EVE combined with the shitty payout it will lead you almost certainly in the sunken cost fallacy that is the basis for the typical highsec carebear mindset which plagues the majority of highsec inhabitants. Which does not encourage financing "PVP activities" but makes people avoid them.
---
It would for sure be a bad way to do it. Like it or not, but lvl 4 missioning is a main income source many alpha players. Taking that away from them doesn't make them stick more to the game. It will only annoy them.

Well, there is two ways you can go about this.  
---
1. If you want to stick with C1-2 Wormholes and want to go cheap, you can go for a Drake. They are able to clear these Sites fairly easy, though you are a big target ofcourse. Its ideal use is probably if you have a Corp to back you up.

This fit should be able to run C3s comfortably, if you got fairly high skills. PvP mods can be replaced with more tank if you don't want to kill explorers on your way.
---
While this one is pretty expensive, you can probably downgrade alot of you don't plan on going into C3s. 
---
For the other T3Cs there is also plenty of other Wormhole PvE fits out there :)
---

AAR: Had to quickform and hype the shit out of this fleet and just hope i get enough ravens with 0 notice. Jumped in with 85ravens and only around 10 CDs but tried to keep reinforcements going. Was a little hasty and ppl fucked up anchor a bit here and there and fighters are just sooooo fucking fast its ridiculous :( With \~75 Ravens we had a hard time cracking that damn mino and since supers can just send their fighters 250km within seconds we kept bleeding ravens here and there. The stukas killed one of their rorqs while we engaged the supers but when they tackled a nyx on a fort we made the mistake and changed the fight location to that fortizar. Giving the rest of their supertits the opportunity to do the same and fight from inside fort tether. At that point the fight was effectivly lost. Hostiles had 170 subs with scrams next door ready to scram but i was told a goon fleet was on the way so we waited for them before we would give extraction a shot. Gave hostiles a little too much time to set up and had to jump through \~quadrillion titans and supers + scramdaws. Made it 2 jumps (way further than anyone expected id say).

It might have been a Wormhole effect background. As you might know, there are different types of effects a wormhole can have, those come with special backgrounds and animations (my guess is, that it was a pulsar [comparison](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/File:WH_Pulsar.jpg)). If you'd like to read up on Wormhole effects further, click [here](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Wormhole_space).

Don't see The Shining listed (some ships are like people: some shine and some don't)

Yeah, it’s just the very first for me that makes me punch through my monitor. The others are fine. Should probably upgrade from i7 2600 rather then go through a new monitor every time I launch the game 
---
Hellcamp implies that the entire force is trapped in one space and cannot defend objectives outside of the camper area. TAPI failed to take anything during the camp cuz they were not camping the staging systems. They were just camping logged off supers. Goons should know, they invented the hellcamp concept iirc.

Another typo; "Dark Matter will drop mostly *Prospulsion*", should be Propulsion. As someone else mentioned, if you could possibly change the font colour for that line as well, bright yellow on white is very difficult to read. Other than that, great work. :)

&gt; On that last point, I'm not gonna ask you what it was, but I will ask how you figured out that it was something that could make you that kind of cash?
---
It is an item that I use, so I understand everything about it.  I know how to use it, and the sort of ships people want to use it on.  I also know how much I'm willing to pay for it, and how far I'm willing to go out of my way to get it at a price I want (price vs. convenience).
---
It is also one of the modules in what I'd class the 'utility' set, which nearly everybody uses, owns one or more of, and have no qualms about owning a lot more of them.  Even better ones are those that have a higher likelihood of being destroyed. 
---
(Bad) example:  T2 damage controls.
---
(Bad) Example:  my first-ever BPO purchase was a small tractor beam.  It is no longer as good of an item though, as it has largely been replaced by MTU.  However at the time it was quite profitable for me.  I had started a second account just to salvage my missions, so I was very familiar with the module.  It was also used for 'mineral-compression' which is no-longer needed thanks to universal ore compression.
---
(Bad) example:  You've just started playing Eve.  What items are you likely to use that even a 2003 veteran might use?
---
Another one of my favourite items is one of the latter, but admittedly T2, as the T1 version doesn't sell at all.  The profitability of the item varies greatly over time, from slightly profitable (5%) to ridiculously profitable (200%).  It is about the only item I'd consider stockpiling for later sale, if I was into do that, because I know I can always sell my inventory of it; demand is rather constant.
---
I personally avoid most items that don't return at least 10% of their manufacture cost, except for really high-value items that may be reasonably quick to produce.  I don't usually sell to buy-orders, except for the high-value items, because I don't want them sitting on the market for a long time (again, "opportunity cost").
---
Lvl 4 missions are not much worse compared to other highsec PVE grinding activities really. They're merely less reward, which means also less risk. Even abyssals become boring quickly enough once you've figured them out.
---
They provide and income source nevertheless, which can definitely help players who want get their feet wet in, let's say, FW as a starter for their PVP career. 
---
You've got to keep in mind that these players have to start somewhere. You simply cannot expect for most of the players to give up everything in their first Eve week and Join Horde or Karmafleet straight away. That's simply not how player progression works.
---
why wouldn't it be, its the meta for everything else
---
This is the first time we used ravens, we get superblobbed no matter what we bring. This goes for everyone not just init and nc

She died free and pure. The best life an AT ship can live.

Major props to you my dude.

So you accept they are botting to rmt?

No friendo, I know far more about botting than you from what I've seen in this thread.

will change it soon... thx

no poors pls

Harrowing vedmacks actually remote rep the stongest. Striking are the high damage ones. Starving are the neuting ones.
---
Very nice.  Will show this on my show next time we do Abyss stuff and will encourage viewers to send donations.  :)
---
Or we were very much aware and did it anyway?

---
i was trying to be generous and give you credit for not making the same mistake you already had, with an even worse doctrine to get camped in
---
Short range automata suppressors have a range of 20km, not 15. Medium range suppressors do not hit missiles  (cause reasons, I have no idea why, this is just my observations). 
---
You bring bombers that’s also not exactly a „getting the good fight“ doctrine.  
---
Give me an example of a “good fight” doctrine please
---
Not all goons are goons.... 
---
Oh yeah. im fully aware. But still. If you are after "goodfights" using a doctrine that actually encourages a fight would be helpful.
---
That depends on what kind of content you're looking for. In the post above, I was recommending a 2-ship process where the first (scanning frigate) finds a good isolated hole and the second (rattlesnake in this case) runs combat sites. For that, when you run out of sites to run you pop out into highsec, deposit loot, and start over.
---
If you're looking for relic hacking sites, you're in a scanning frigate the whole time so just keep going deeper. Every wormhole has at least one static and all C1-C3 holes have a static exit to k-space.
---
If you're daytripping for gas (which I highly recommend, especially if you're just learning to dualbox and want to try something low investment that makes good use of the second character), then you'll want to delve deep enough into w-space to find one of the really good gas sites. From there, if you fill up you're definitely coming right back out, but it will usually take you two or three sites of getting chased off by the rats before you fill your tanks. I would probably keep going in until I filled up, and just make sure that at least one of my Ventures has a probe launcher on it.

muninns
---
If you want to have a very different experience, join a nullsec group that has discord/voice comms, the newbro groups are a good bet as they will generally have action you can get your teeth into. Brave/Horde being options. 
---
I came back (was hisec industrialist) and joined Horde, it's amazing fun with an active nullsec group, completly differnt experience. Experienced guys to point you in the  right direction, good income from moon mining, ratting, PI, industrial stuff etc. Give it a try. 
---
Shameless plug... Horde now lives pretty close to jita, so it's really easy to just come on down and get stuck in!
---
When we bring muninns, superblob 
---
Can you sell the Trinary datastream thingys to an NPC? 
---
Still have to solve some errors but i would appreciate it

thx, i will change it soon

Hi! Im a nubro, what is Deadspace? I pretty much have only been exploring Wormholes. TIA :)
---
Is that so?

He actually got promoted the CCP Spider - You get to change your CCP name when you change out of GM-ing FWIK.
---
GF dudes who didn't bring the supers! 
---
oh okay
---
you *are* actually that thick
---
have you considered that deploying to someone's core home region, tackling their krabs and reinforcing their jump bridges within range of their supercap staging was going to get this response no matter what you tried, and that you could have gotten a better response pushing in on the periphery rather than trying to headshot?
---
Deadspace is a therm for sites you can run (not missions) who lead you into a deadly area of space :-)
---
TY sir. I will work towards this. Any idea of total cost?
---
When I sold in nullsec, I sold most things at Jita prices.  I never really had a problem selling anything.
---
I sold a few things above Jita.  Waaaaaay above Jita.  Because the demand on those items was just insane, and the logistics of hauling them was also a PITA, so I manufactured them locally.
---
That’s a single example lol
---
https://discord.gg/sggqGr
---
Injectors should maybe be replaced with accelerators.
---
So anything that isn’t a boosh setup warrants a good fight? 
---
You’re welcome. 
---
Would it be different the other way around? Its ok if you superblob someone in your space.. but its not fair if someone does it to you... like pls...
---
Most people who quit (and they can't tell an inactive account from someone who actually quit) are probably high sec carebears, so it makes sense.
---
Could be! I'll check the system again. Thanks!
---
Came expecting a meme, found an actually useful infographic. Nice one.
---
That’s not what I’m saying, it’s totally reasonable for them to superblob because they can, everyone does that. Like I said, it’s not just init and nc 
---
Wait, I thought we redeployed back to Fountain?
---
Thats indeed correct, they are Damage Dealers with Remote Repair and i change this error soon!

With Hull this exact fit is about 30Mil
---
Honestly with the ability to still run incursions and abyssals l4s should be the last place a newbro makes isk. 
---
That being said they shouldnt be barred from it like this. The missions all need to be retooled and rebalanced with the amount of isk coming into the game everywhere else L4s cant be a problem in a Faust sense. They simply dont pay enough..

As a small number rorq owner though (3) nerfs to them hurt. They hurt bad :( The people with 20+ don't have an issue as they just scale more. IMO still biggest fail by CCP is not balancing them based on "can only have X rorqs per anom/per system" and FORCE a spread out. 
---
pfft they just gotta adapt
---
Kinda easy to find today's thumbnail
---
Anyway, welcome back

Easiest dickbutt find ever.

I’ve been jonesing for a Carlos post.

Still with some wrong infos but i am working on it...

you used yellow with white background, not a great idea, hard to read in the bottom right

nice frags but imagine if fr0sty lee had fit a cap booster instead of a shield extender!
---
Day 3. Init invasion abandoned, back to fountain o/
---
Yeah he's a bad'un.
---
if you are losing muninns to supers, you have other problems
---
this so hard, not even a wormholer but when we are on ninja fleets my f1 is cloak.
---
what alliance are you in
---
Pando the subhuman trying to escape instead of self destructing his entire Mach fleet like a real NC fc
---
Short cut to type the word "monkey"
---
Yes, that seems logical ... except to the person that just wants to build stuff.
---
That person will even buy materials to build stuff ... at a loss!
---
Yes, these sort of people exist, and in more significant numbers than you might expect.
---
There is also no argument that can be formulated that will ever convince them to change their chosen game-play.
---
I still have yet to run abyssal sights due to being a market care bear
---
Throwback to when NC was in a similar situation a year or two ago and just self destructed an entire Mach fleet
---
&gt; I still hold INIT highly, especially when compared with other null groups
---
to be fair once you set the bar this low it ain't hard to surpass it.
---
Yes you can. In fact that's their only use, apart from getting the lore items from the bioadaptive caches.
---
there are other factors to consider, like the fact that you're sitting on the doorstep of our core home region tackling our krabs and reffing our jump bridges like a bunch of assholes
---
but in general the less cancer you try to be, the more willing people will be to indulge you in good fights, yes
---
I agree
---
But you are reffing our shit like a bunch of assholes too
---
Why are you bringing up the " some alliances bring good fights" then? Pls..
---
so it has 10 drone slots or 5? do the mining drones work with the strip miners?
---
Some do
---
Its about to get changed
---
Technically you can do quite a lot as an alpha, so you really don't *have to* pay to play, eventually you'll find yourself not enjoying what you're being limited by, but you can do quite a lot without paying a cent. Finding the right corp or having a group of friends definitely helps, but there's a lot of things to check out to see if you want to pay for the subscription and since you never have to pay the sub and you can continue to check things out...it's only subscription based when you want it to be - and...when you're highly trained. Skills will retract to Alpha if you pass its limits in training on Omega - I think that's about when you would consider the game being pay to play...but you still have a lot at your disposal.
---
Compare it to another "sub-based" mmo that has a trial system. I think Eve gives you one of the most diverse free to play trial than the majority of others.
---
Is this the power of ultra instinct 
---
where do you sell them?
---
You can deploy 5 at a time, if you need to kill ratts in Belts but the hobgoblins out, otherwise you can use the mining drones for some extra profit. You use them like normal attack drones, just that you let them engage asteroids instead of ships :) 
---
Also the only time you've brought a non Boosh doctrine lol
---
Idk man. I like the current kestrel design, but that might just be personal preference. What isn't personal preference is that the Bantam is one of the ugliest ships in the game. Seriously, go look at it, you'll probably be as disgusted as I am.
---
Only if that were true lol
---
Current design is good, that one doesn't really look Minmatar T1 at all.
---
Thank you! We only have a couple of us, so it sounds like if someone wanted to declare war and fielded more than 5 or 6 battleship+, we'd have a problem even with base defenses. I was hoping the defenses of the citadel would help us a bit more, but it's ultimately not THAT expensive even if they do decide to blow one up. We're not miners or industrialists, so maybe it's more work than it's worth.
---
Regarding feedback, maybe I'll draft something up and post it here anyway. I've been doing bug reports ingame when things come up and they seem to be going somewhere (at least the status is updated) so it'll make me feel better to at least try. :)
---
You can do PVE without being harassed, but not without being ganked.
---
Like I said to my corp on what's app, I'm pretty sure to trigger people  with carriers killing subs, thanks to give me reason I should have taken bet.
---
NPC buy orders, like blue loot.
---
RHMLs are pretty decent and worth the train.
---
Brawling armor torp 'phoons are sweet though.
---
Obviously this was a sad attempt at saving face after being called out for having a shorter deployment than TAPI.
---
hello you started it
---
Lol, back to elementary school I see
---
Init has always had multiple stagings for years. Going back for a few days to refil wallets and bunt down intruders is what they always do.
---
Oh cool thankyou! Are they Combat Sites that pop up on the scanner? 
---
Thanks il have a look :)
---
&gt; lucid deepwatchers
---
is remote armor and target paint but also self repair
---
dont give ccp fucking ideas for messing up rorqs
---
This is great so I only have minor criticisms and suggestions. 
---
You have a lot of space around your "best damage to deal section" so I think you can safely increase the text size and the box itself to make it easier to read. Also I think the transparency is increased on that box compared to the others, which makes it harder to read with the complex background, especially with the smaller text. 
---
You could also maybe change the text "turret and missile disr." to "weapon disruption" or "turret&amp;missile disruption" under the npc ship types. If you sorted the npc types alphabetically then that would make the npc types easier to find too. 
---
Actually menr the story how its written what happend the br links are usually trash but i guess that hard to get right from raw data
---
Falcon is pure love...

I have found selling nullsec moon goo pretty profitable.   Im not a big t2 producer, so I dont have a real reason to do reactions, although I am curious about the margins of reaction outputs.  I use the minerals from moon rocks for production and sell the moon goo for a pretty good price in hi-sec markets.  Then try to maximize profits from the minerals by building components or ships with a larger (10%) margin.   I can sometimes net 2b from a single moon rock pull.  
---
Haha thanks dude, just a nice shitpost :)

Miss you, hope you're back soon!

"We have a dedicated team for balancing"

"Our new project is a next step for EVE"  
---
yea good thing CCP never sells empty promises. thinking_emoji.wav
---
This is dumb. When will CCP realize this kind of response of bring infinite supers/titans under your capital umbrella does not make for compelling game play. It's not as if this kind of response is unique to panfam either: you see the same shit whether you are in Delve(Goons), Esoteria(TEST), Deteroid(FRT), Deklein(GOTG), Tribute(panfam), Fountain(INIT), etc. 
---
CCP needs to remove the stupid restrictions on jump fatigue/ranges now that everyone under the sun can actually source their own minerals from their own regions, instead of from Jita. There is no benefit to locking the map up into self-enclosed black-holes of supercapital/titan power centers.
---
so they work in tandem with strip miners I'm guessing? TY for your help.
---
You should read Stainguy's response below yours (it seems to have been downvoted).
---
I addressed this same line of thought there.
---
Says someone from Triumvirate lol
---
Nope, like 2 minor lag spikes, and I've been on since downtime.
---
still trying to hard
---
Correction; EVE players attack SC because it's an even better source of tears than suicide ganking or afk cloaking. 
---
But it's really, really like that the last year or two. Ever since CCP Larrikin decided that Titans and supers weren't oppressive enough and decided to really amp things up. Riiiiiiiiight about the same time that CCP quintupled the amount of minerals a single account could produce, by an odd coincidence.
---
Everyone saying INIT has given up didnt read the post. We're temporarily moving back home to take care of our so, then it'll be back out to Hakonen. 
---
imagine being init
---
imagine being a strong independent CSM titan-main wh btw alliance 
---
imagine your northern deployment going worse than tapi's
---
Such as?
---
This was the kind of fight I wanted to see you guys bring. The ravens were refreshing.   
---
You knew were were going to get dropped. That basically goes without saying. I actually secured the tackle and web on your monitor loss. My only advice is to stop running to dead end systems. Once I heard where you were, I knew you were going to lose your fleet.
---
gg. gf. Take a break back at home.   
---
You're right, I forgot about your elite thrasher squads. 
---
Goons
---
and hobgoblin 1 ok for .7 - .5 sec?
---
our fortizars will blot out the sun
---
That and muninns, but thrashers &gt; muninns 
---
Mission content is, overwhelmingly, a fucking disease that drives new players away through sheer boredom. 
---
So are you saying that if we brought muninns we wouldn't get superblobbed?
---
I just want to be clear: that's what you're implying here? It'd be :fairfights: and not massed titans and supers and wololol INIT are so terribad that they can't take on equal numbers of supercaps with subcaps get rekt nubs..?
---
Because I'm afraid history is not on your side if that's what you're predicting.
---
what's the counter for massed titans?
---
