Didn't feel like ceptoring 20+ jumps anymore to be honest. Too much effort lol
---
---
---
Zkill only shows what people share there.
---
Yes that's why I was flying with my wh corp not SC.
---
Why are you arguing against it then? Lots of bots, but could be 1%? How does that make sense?
---

---
&gt;The solution to botting is to eliminate easily repeatable pve.
---
It would require a redesign of pretty much the entire game and the market. You will never get that, which is likely why you ask for it. It allows you to be against bots while maintaining the status quo where bots roam freely.
---
The solution to botting is automated banning for the low hanging fruit and having someone act based on reports.
---
Eve and CCP needs a taxonomy      
---
Convo me :)
---
Fair enough, I think that was caused by some initial confusion on our side when the leshaks landed.  I know I managed to burn my confessor out of range, and then was too busy with logi to properly follow target calls for a while.  
---
I want to say a year ago.  They increased the signature radius of fighters and made them much more vulnerable.  They may have done other things to carriers at the same time but that is the only one I remember (I am not a carrier pilot).
---
being em to j space i tell you
---
Are you saying CCP is done with Eve? Sounds like you're happy and any change CCP does is just in nobody's interest. Any change would interfere with how you play. OMG. I pray for you. Adding game features is what keeps Eve alive. Please go away. Far away. 
---
SIGNED
---
it's not fair breaking the tos got you banned
---
I know my man, just being ironic while pointing out that the foundation for having fun is, well, grinding isk. One way or another. I dropped my "/s" somewhere.
---
I just reddit and eve. Youve always had a negative outlook and never can blame yourself. Maybe its harsh but when you make this comments it can seem to others like a common experience rather than just you being an exceptional case. 
---
Idk maybe pm him in game offer a Plex and see where you get to. Best do it from calmer feet though, if you do it from horde he might get sweaty over a lowball offer and purge you
---
If you're comfortably funding whatever it is you do for fun and still have time to spare after said fun, then yeah! Go play something else in your downtime too.
---
Marvelous, who dares wins is an alliance of wankers
---
I guess it can't be a problem if nobody plays
---
With how active he is lately you were bound to quit pretty soon.
---
I am totally onboard with this
---
could he of had a kill right on you? 
---
Takes like 20 years to train every skill in Eve. In saying that, there are around a hundred ships of all different sizes that require different skills to fly. If you focus on one ship 'class' you can easily train perfect skills for most options.
---
I fucking love the eve online community
---
TIL Gilbert Gottfried plays EVE.
---
Protip, if in late AUTZ / early EUTZ hit up FXR, those guys will take a fight 
---
The only counter to being outsmarted is not being dumb in the first place. Prophylactic [self-education](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Scams_in_EVE_Online) goes a long way. The alternative is the school of hard knocks. The beauty of EVE is that the developers provide the persistent sandbox and then [stand back](https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/203218892-Scams) to allow the players figure out what to do with it.
---
bot better
---
\+1 remove it. If I didn't get tired of probing sigs, I'd still live in w-space just for this 1 feature. 
---
HACs can fit through C1 wormholes.
---
Seen as everyone is in here saying how nice shneckt are and they are gud dudes fight, i thought id drop by and also leave a review. 
---
These dudes are toxic as fuck, steer clear of them! they have threatened to rape me IRL and have committed all kinds of atrocities in the name of a good time, all they are doing is destroying the game we all love. 
---
fuck shneckt and the horse they rode in on..... 
---
Armchair psychiatrists are the scourge of the internet.
---
extremely underrated post! sums up the gameplay so flawlessly i got a tear in my eye...
---
Miner calm down.
---
Anybody got a chain to rage? I've got a poor pilot stuck in there with no probes 
---
I thought you meant that dotlan would show what system skill U lived in.
---
However, I'm a little confused. Skill U was deployed elsewhere, but apparently lived in space they don't own, that was owned by people they aren't allied with (according to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/9lyz80/chaostheory_leaves_gotg_to_die_in_molden_heath/e7bxm8e/) guy), and they had no structures in that space (iirc).
---
Maybe I just wasn't paying attention, but there was nothing that indicated to me that Skill U lived anywhere nearby. But the second we took some of PROT space, they come running with supers in tow to shut us down. The best theory that I could come up with was that they thought we would batphone TRI or something, but we had no one coming to help us. Honestly, the whole alliance was a bit bewildered by the whole thing. Skill U just showed up out of nowhere. To kick over a 300-man alliance.
---
Perhaps more like 
---
1. I love eve
---
2. I hate these changes
---
3. Look for something else
---
4. There is nothing else
---
5. I guess i'll play eve, because everything else is simply shittier
---
6. Repeat step 2-6 every few months
---
Rule 34
---
Do you not?
---
See the first question in the [zkillboard FAQ](https://zkillboard.com/information/faq/).
---
Brings a tear to my eye how well some people are able to capture what eve truly is - a shit boring game where you spend hours for that one moment that never comes...
---
No quite the contrary, I was expecting it to last longer than 4 days 
---
I'm not arguing against it. I'm arguing against you making up numbers based on nothing other than your own personal guess and then getting super salty when it's called out. Stop moving the goalposts, I'm not gonna sit here and argue the finer points of bot banning. We're here because you made a stupid claim and then, in true idiot fashion, doubled down.
---
You missed an opportunity to figure out how to gank bads for 2 years. 
---
That’s a stupid amount of catalysts lmao.
---
Not if CCP implements this idea though. 
---
No bullshit though, if you decide you want to get into this game and enjoy it, stay off this sub for a few more months... or more...  
---
   
---
Very little to be learned here tbh. It's just us shitposting, bitching about the new and old game mechanics that mean something obscure to someone equally more obscure, and as you've already seen, the content just isn't very *newbro* friendly or relatable. The game can be overwhelming enough, taking *advice* or something you interpret from this sub and applying it in game will likely only end up in disaster for you - that said, seeing you do it or describing what happened after the fact would be very entertaining to us, so please **do** post such experiences...  
---
  
---
GL there, little feller.
---
You're just mad we don't hang out with you in Eranakko anymore while you ship spin &lt;3 Luv you buddy
---
&gt;  while also making it more profitable to do so (dropping something in the wreck would be great). 
---
No. Everything in the game should be from players, not magical space magic. You already get plenty of loot from the capital mods and salvage, what more do you need?
---
Your reward is that you help reduce inflation which makes your isk (and mines) worth more in the long run.
---
Xafen better have some bonus for this !
---
the wreck is from the player... 
---
help curb inflation.. you had me at hello.
---
Look Sparton you're famous now!
---
Jokes on you they were just pretending.
---
if you want isk... work for it dipshit
---
you dont get isk handed you on plate.... go mine like a real eve player
---
If you think it could be 1%, you cannot also think there are a lot of bots. Clearly you are defending the bots.
---
The reason you have a problem with 15-25% is because it is likely true, and it draws attention to the problem (which you dont want to fix other than on paper with a solution you know will never happen).
---
How long does it take you guys to set up and prep to kill each of these Nyx? 
---
can confirm, I usually roam with IOU and we always get fights.
---
No matter how invested you are in it, it's still space magic and laser swords.  It doesn't matter if the plot is consistent, stop taking yourself so seriously over space magic and laser swords.
---
can confirm!
---
we killed atleast 2 supers with the exact same behavior after getting tackled...repeatedly launching and recalling fighters
---
Did that for a few weeks in an astero and was a lot of fun. Just hopping around Eve, visited a few regions I’d never been to, made bunch of money, was great time
---
Do the orca but nomad with it + an alt. Bring a few ships to do anomalies/sites with too 
---
It's mostly just 1 guy trying to catch them, then if he does he pings. Zero prep whatsoever, they don't fight back.
---
I don’t imagine I will be doing much pve. Just hunting :-). Yeah I will have a couple of alts for this. 
---
Honed edge, my lord. 
---
I would like to say I am the master mind for it... 
---
However, I do not have the patience.  We have one dude called fabio; he is responsible for all botting super kills.
---
When we have an NSS in botting regions and people can be bothered.. about 30minutes. 
---
I went to reactivate and it was 19.99 for 3months. Great deal and its what made me sub. I did it on Dec 26th.
---
Absolutely, those hours spent afk VNI’ing while watching anime only make you appreciate the things your buy more, and makes you shed those sweet salty tears when it go boom
---
That's pretty cool. Props to Fabio for putting in all that time and effort. Sucks that other than a shiny killmail, there's not much else in it for you guys.
---
Kithed the ring
---
Don’t see how :)
---
Derelik deez nutz
---
Sorry
---
Couldn't help myself
---
You need a lesson in reading comprehension, or perhaps not assuming whatever is convenient for you to make a point. I didn't say I thought it was 1%. I said we have no idea what the number is and used that as an example. 
---
The reason I have a problem with 15-25% is because you just made that shit up, and if you knew anything about me you'd know I'm the last person to defend botting. We're done here - not because it's not a conversation, but because it's not worth having with you. And before you get your handy quip ready, don't assume that because someone isn't willing to engage you that they don't have an opinion and aren't willing to defend it. Sometimes it's just not worth dealing with an obstinate moron on the internet.
---
Fairly accurate. 
---
I've been saying the same about bots for so long, it's kind of embarrassing at this point. But no I'm sure they are just players willing to rat 23/7 with nigh perfect reactions. The term AFK vni is more accurate than ever.
---
I was hoping that after the PC Gamer article something might actually get done, instead we got a made up number of accounts banned and a hisec PR stunt.
---
Those 8 Nyx I worked out and killed in one night, they just moved to new toons, new corp, new region and started right back up again. I doubt we even put a dent in his profits. 
---
I also get what you mean about loot, I think I only made a bil or two from those 8 Nyx.
---
Props for posting this
---
The best thing that EVE has going for it is that all the other MMOs are doing SO MUCH WORSE.
---
When is CCP bringing out some new dlc? Tired of looking at the same old meteor packs and all the others.... I can't even buy it, because I have already bought it once.... It's a year old man!
---
Personally i think you can do plenty as an alpha, treating it sorta like a trial. Omega however will let you do more in what you like. For instance if you like doing exploration you might be limited to your T1 faction exploration frig and the SoE ships, but if you upgrade to omega you get the T2 exploration frigs.
---
As other people had mentioned larger corps tend to have SRP or Ship Replacement Programs and can offer T1 frigs like candy. Personally i would find a new player friendly corp in high sec or low sec. The corp im with hired me doesnt have ships on hand for SRP, but ones lost in war time i could ask for the ISK value of whats lost, and we have plenty of moon goo to mine.
---
It was either Boney or Warr Akini.  
---
Last Burn Jita Boney was begging fleet members to look into their archives because he himself lost this picture.  
---
One dude found it and was awarded 1bil I think.
---
You better believe I'll commit atrocities in the name of a good time! I liked you better when you were into Arseslutery ;)
---
Jelly
---
We play Eve our way sir. Gf 
---
i mean, if you cant kill something yourself, you call in people who want kills too. All of these groups beat the shit out of each other on a daily basis...
---
in hangar bays.  but in a door to the bridge.....on the side opposite the bridge? that damaged?
---
I fc'd 50 timers against horde but okay.
---
Was in Rage and got bombed. Heated hardeners and hit ADC still died. 
---
But then you’re using either rapid lights or heavies as opposed to artillery. And I believe minims are gonna be fast enough to make the range advantage not a huge factor no?
---
You said it could be. But there is no reason to even go that low since you dont believe it. So you had another reason. You want to pretend the number could be anything so botting doesnt seem like a big problem, but more of a "we cant be sure yet" kind of issue.
---
&gt;The reason I have a problem with 15-25% is because you just made that shit up
---
No. I made a modest estimation based on what I see in game. It could be wrong, but probably isn't.
---
It bothers you that it is likely correct. If it was total bullshit like 100% or 0%, you wouldnt care much. But for some reason (you are probably a botter), this is very important to you.
---
Aw then just use the orca to hold your various pvp ships and ammo then! Still nomad tho, bring a blops alt for bonus fun with t3s.
---
At least this is what I aspire to do someday
---
Imagine if CCP came out with their own “Somer Blink” style casino. That would be a pretty good isk sink no? 
---
hahahahahahahahaha what.
---
oruze man bad
---
I'm ashamed to be a Jedi after that movie.
---
I know. I'm in them. 
---
But hk eviction didn't bring wspace together or re-write boundaries, who's friends, etc. Didn't change anything except the amount of keepstars in wspace dropped quite drastically from 8 to 3 
---
kk
---
Insurance fraud would come back as the only way to fund sov bills.
---
Revanite ftw!
---
I can tell you with certainty that it is somewhere between 0 and 100%.
---
When it works like the X3 Hub.
---
Woah woah woah, that's not how it works in the real world.
---
Wait, that's exactly how it works. Fuck.
---
&gt; You want to pretend the number could be anything so botting doesnt seem like a big problem, but more of a "we cant be sure yet" kind of issue.
---
I've literally never said or implied anything even close to this - you need to assume it's true in order to maintain some twisted view of the world where anyone who disagrees with you is a botter. 
---
&gt; you are probably a botter
---
wewlad yeah I'm in the epic botting alliance Black Legion have you heard of us
---
I assume you mean kkk skins?
---
Most people wouldn't buy those but they would sell more than one which is one too many.
---
Let me tell you, it is def... &lt;Disconnected from Local Chat&gt;
---
lol xD
---
They did. It's called high sec ganking and hoping the good loot drops. Roll of the dice each time. 
---
Hey Thadd :), we didnt even know you guys were gonna come, it was the purple gate camp we were coming to break, then someone called on comms that your cyno tengu was coming. GF tho!
---
Sadly pressing one button and being in a standing fleet is too hard for some people.
---
Omg that was amazing, I’d completely forgotten about that 
---
Sorry I was too busy watching the vape tricks to pay attention to the drekavac.
---
I am to bad at this game to care about turret tracking weapon systems. Sorry :( . rlml and keyboard faceroll all day . 
---
You were not being ironic it was just a dumb straw man argument 
---
ah, another sheep
---
Seriously help me understand, how is actual people mining or ratting hurting the game?  Is it poorer people being mad or who is it and what’s the problem with it?
---
Just remove local. It would solve so many problems in one easy step.
---
tmocc sucks fuck gian

It's meant to be funny, but it is also a graphical representation of how the EVE lifecycle plays out. Get into a corp. Get into null. GET TO THE CHOPPER.
---
This may be a dumb question, but what program are you using to see a little window of your other account that you can click on to switch between the two? I have two accounts, and only one monitor, so this would really help me out. Also, I'm seriously impressed with how you're managing the two ships at once.
---
When you're trying to be funny in a post, you'll have better results if you vary your language. Saying "you know" three times in six sentences is pretty bad, yo.
---
Also, what you're asking for is already made, CCP has made skins with flames on your ship, skins with damage showing, etc. 
---
Perhaps a blood transfusion can rinse out the medichlorians.

Is PIRAT allied with TEST now in highsec? What a time to be alive.

On CONCORD response times, if you're near a station or something you'll get blapped by the sentry guns in a small ship.

removing wormholes would solve all this
---
Try out abyssal sites! I’ve been enjoying both the PvE and PvP sides of it. 
---
I don’t think so, there’s a setting that monitors bandwidth over metered connections, which I’ve never used.

reminds me of the old dual armor rep hurricanes

i'll buy one
---
If he doesn't post his API to zkill, zkill will only show the kills he manually posts there - so just your kills, not his losses. 
---
If you had shot him before he got concorded, you could post his lossmail there yourself. (At least, I believe that should give you the killmail)
---
You know I'll be the first to admit I might be clueless. I kinda just clicked on the skins tab for the ships I fly and they're all... you know... shit.
---
Sure, a cheetah and a probe isn't a very high end ship. But, you know, a lot of fuckers fly them. You know?
---
Try clicking the Download All option on the client so it doesn't download stuff on the fly.
---
already done this. and no longer get the spinning circle in the bottom of my neocom saying resource loading
---
Set up email forwarding or something, mang
---
Most fleets are subcaps though... like my Corp pings a real cap fleet very rarely, and it’s usually a “all hands on deck, we need to save a rorq” or something. Subcap fleets are a lot of fun, especially with tactical destroyers. Those are my personal favorite. 
---
so whats provi up to these days? i lived there for 5 years but have been out of game since we lost the last great war.
---
No it isn't.
---
You have a thing nobody wants, because it has a hefty cool down, that expires very soon.
---
It's going nowhere but deeper in to the dumpster than it's already in.
---
But, nice try.
---
+1 for small wormhole corps, PvP, mining, exploration, my first month back in eve was so boring till I joined.
---
Tried telling this to people, and they were like nah it will rise just before it expires, it's eve economics... Fucking lol, people don't get supply vs demand at all 
---
What plan/rate do you have with Google Fibre?
---
The SP farmers are the real winners. You can make tons of isk right now by extracting all your skills. Try it.
---
hi friend i like killmarks though they are really pretty so thanks for any welps and dreadbombs have a good night
---
Ha, got'em
---
yeah but if i dont do that how will i validate my existence
---
My main has that same rando bullshit last name. &lt;/3
---
have you tried dropping out of warp?? i dont think even google fiber works at ftl speeds dude
---
I don't get why these hyperspatial rigged botting supers use no implants, like for real can you not afford a couple extra bil for ascendancies to get danker ticks?

gigabit, 5ghz wifi currently, but plan on testing a wired connection here in the next couple days.

Don't you have a massive fleet to join, so you can reeeeee around in a HAC until you bubble a capital and  proceed to gang up 100 to 1 then gloat to all your corpies about your cap kill? Reeeeeeeee

how bout fixing the game first

price has consistently gone down since release and are down by 22m from yesterday

good luck

Another guy who wants eve to be a single player game.

Sounds as Windows 10 thinks can use all not used in one client, to update itself. Windows 10 for me take very much bandwith. I am i5 with 32gb and SSD but slow Inyternet (10 ADSL)  When is in updating process, normally i only can have one client open (my wife play HoS and Wow and hhave not the problem with windows 10 anyway)
---
Missed opportunity to call it the Strap-Ion Blaster II
---
Yup that’s understandable I just wasn’t sure how that worked.  Hard to shoot them when you’re flying a T1 freighter.  It’s all good.  
---
Careful, might cut yourself on all that edge
---
Kinda worried after reading that title/poster flair.  After seeing the nado fits, all is well.  Keep doing whatever this is!

Jump drive calibration V don’t have it? Get it. It’s shitty to train but it’s so useful. No fun having a juicy target and several of your guys not be able to make it

and they're going to want to use them

Thanks, I think he's good for a while.  We started running level 4s together today in his shiny new battleship with a great fitting.  I think what he wants more than anything now is PvP training, and that's an area I've never been into so can't help much.

was fun for sure! excited for the kill timer! Good on you guys made that difficult :P

Firstly, nerf chain booshing. Secondly, was a fun fight, lots of twists and turns. A bit slow getting our counter drop cyno in place and the fort just went into reff so we figured we would let those dreads live another day! gf gf 
---
GF Snuff 'n' Wangs!
---
Not an indy guy, but as far as I know it's a combination of the following reasons:
---
1.) Your competitors are using blueprints which have been researched to take less resources to manufacture, thus allowing them to reduce their prices and keep a profit
---
2.) Your competitors are sourcing their resources in a smarter way - a different market, private agreements with miners, or their own personal mining operation
---
3.) Prices fluctuate, and for one reason or another the cost of the resources has increased before the products have had a chance to 'catch up'. 
---
Good fight init! Was great fun!
---
Well if you are adressing OP with "you guys" we were the majority of dreads dropping on your side there. It sure was fun tho.
---
I’d... doubt it. With people have 500-1000 account skill farms it drastically increases the numbers. 
---
Chaining level 5 missions with carriers and C5 sites with dreads for long-time players. Abyssal sites are ok, T4 will give you decent returns for an affordable price. You can explore but you'll be in Catch, Stain and Esoteria, and generally those regions contain many explorers.  
---
Alternatively, try PvPing for your isk. Use cheap ships - kestrel, slicer, insured T1 combat BCs - and scoop as much loot as you can. You should turn a mild profit, or at least break even on your losses.
---
&gt;Firstly, nerf chain booshing.
---
fucking delet this bonga
---
Most fun I've had in a scimitar in a long while - great job with the Nagas. Watching them blap stuff off the grid from 250km away was scary as fuck, not gonna lie.

I literally just went through this. I ended up putting a ticket in and CCP actually got back to me within a day, and got it fixed that day as well. It was really surprising because it was new years day also.

Hey thanks man :)

gratz u had 2 fights in provi...

What, you mean like the new Abyss content we got? That's my best guess of what "DLC" would look like in a subscription-based MMO like this one.
---
Overall the E-Uni Wiki is a great ressource for newer and older players

send it to a banned or dead character, then uninstall the game

lowsec moon mining with porpoise and covetors, total fleet is worth less than 100 mill but will pull like 7k m3 a minute

After i got bored from the grind and all the sh!t i already know in EVE, i made a list of things i never did in my time in EVE. Im trying all the aspects at the moment, i never touched. Which is pretty cool and challenging again. An yes, Live in J-Space is one of those things
---
Maybe buy a PLEX for me???)))
---
Invest, theres some people who do that kind of stuff, or you could maybe buy plex for short term, or skins and never again released modules like geckos, skins, and those special bcs if you want long term investment.

It's a myth that you need space to make isk. Really.

Lol that is not even remotely close. Your saying you think the number of players subscribed to the reddit thread over the past X number of years indicates eves active player base today? 
---
Thank you for countering my "Rough Guess" based on a little evidence by providing none of your own. Yes, subscriptions show interest in something. Not everyone however, is on reddit, and some people don't play any longer but stay here and shitpost because they have no joy in their life, and attempt to achieve that joy by needlessly shitting on others.

For the low low price of an alpha account and like 2 mil SP, you can train up a minimum requirement Vindicator pilot for running shield incursions with Warp to Me. Bonus points of this approach is the pilot lives in the ship and so when you want to run incursions, you don't have a bunch of logistics to do moving your main and a ship around. Just fly your vindi to the current focus and get dank isk. 
---
Now that you can train up to battleships, focused utility alpha accounts are really useful. It can take a month or three to train up for what you want, but at the end of that, you have a free account that can run L4's or run incursions or do FW oplexing, etc. There's pros and cons to this approach but it's definitely something to consider.
---
Depends on how you calculate it.
---
Eliminating outliers like skill farmers is something which should be done.
---
Luckily, these are usually not all online while playing eve on the main account. Meaning the users online you see isnt drastically impacted by it. 
---
&gt;you did your job well, we just couldn't wing you, and you kept our logi in an exposed position the entire fight....

Why have the countdown continue? That's still punishing people for having shoddy internet. Give them invulnerability and pause the countdown until they log back in. What's wrong with that?

Or, we could not forget to bring CDs next time. Classic USTZ imo.
---
Good AAR thanks! Fun fight! See you guys soon
---
Or an external battery backup.
---
Jebaited!
---
Totally depends on the corp. Generally, the bigger they are, the more relaxed they are about such things. If you have 1000 people, nobody really cares if one of them is around a lot or not - everyone has bigger things to worry about!
---
&gt;(you might argue that some beacon camper might have to wait longer but do you really think that is such a big deal?)
---
CCP would have to make it such that filaments can't be used in combat, if this isn't already the case, else t1s will become portable "get out of PVP free" tokens (pop filament, yank the plug, wait for attacker to get bored and leave, log back in, finish filament).
---
Is it possible that CCP didn't change the disconnect mechanics and doing so causes your ship to warp 1 AU out of the bubble? The only way you die to "unstable depths" is by going outside the bubble.

Welp this is going to make me afraid to go abyss diving from now on.
---
The scan frig has scan bonus - helps a lot with the combat scanners.
---
Besides this, it's similiar to VNI ratting vs. carrier ratting. Scan frig+salvage drones are slower, but also a lot less work.
---
Actually it works best if you don't ninja. Find a ratter/mission runner, who blues his wrecks for you (maybe offer a million or so), release your drones and drop an MTU, put your salvager on the T2 wreck if there is one, go afk for 15 minutes. Requires much lower skills than VNI ratting and 1/10th of the ISK investment.

I'd go further and faction fit 100 PvP ventures.

Then go piss off null bears

No I mean the the meteor packs that you can buy.

I've lost three friends to incursions, the brst of them lasted 4 hours before biomassing and drowning himself in rum.
---
I've had this before, with both Eve and pubg. It seems to be a modem issue for me which I can sometimes fix by restarting it/swapping it with a spare. I don't exactly know what causes the problem, it comes and goes at hours/days/weeks for me.
---
Try tethering off ur phone and see what happens instead of taking it to ur folks, Eve only gently sips data
---
My ethernet driver monitors all traffic in and out. Eve never takes much, all month so far with 3 accounts has been less than a gig up/down.
---
Why do you claim CCP are assisting you by turning off POS guns?
---
At a billion ISK, that's about 2 Million in items per hull and that's ignoring the cost of the hull itself. So basically you'll be flying a paper ship barely capable of killing the FW plex npc.

You need to learn the definition of DLC.

My neighbor have a cat that is over 30lbs.... he much wider than longer.

Get some T1 cruisers and and maybe one faction, and have fun ?

O lawd he comin

CCP do refer to them as DLC, he's not wrong. 
---
lol dickhead
---
I would do that right away. Wifi can at times be so scatchy it's the first thing you want to eliminate before trouble shooting.

You can also open your task manager to see if something is using your bandwidth.

I have a bunch of Gallente tags but have no idea how to use them. Do I just sell these things?

It’s not a command dessy doctrine.

Lol watching you project what a lonely virgin you are daily is the reason I keep coming back to reddit, never change Leetmcfeet, you'll get that dick sucked one day brother.

Good ol rule 34 in action
---
Yeah I know. It's just hard to watch a successful anti-doctrine at work and not wish you didn't have the same advantage 
---
First thing that comes to my mind is using a omega account and a alpha account at the same time.
---
For my work I often stay at hotels and use their network via VPN or even cellular to login and I never had this problem. I do use 2factor authorization. 
---
 Enjoy your real life,you are free now!
---
Yeah, I am very sure you already can't use it with weapons timer or capsuleer logoff timer which is 15 minutes wait time. (At least that was a case when abyss was first introduced. Maybe someone tested it recently and can confirm this.) But at that point anyone can just logoff.
---
You people need to learn how to read posts. I'm not wrong about dlc and CCP is not wrong either. The acronym dlc stands for downloadable content and that is exactly what they are saying......  Now to my question when are we getting more stuff that we can buy? Does anyone know?
---
It's neither downloadable nor content, it's a bunch of money and a skin.
---
&gt; Now to my question when are we getting more stuff that we can buy? Does anyone know?
---
There are plenty of skins added to the game on a regular base.
---
2 weeks is kind of enough ,-)

The key is to have something mentally stimulating going on in a second screen so you don't lose yourself to the mind numbing suffering that is repetitive PVE.  :P

Firstly trying to get someones livelihood taken away because you haven't got what you want is excessive and just wrong.

Imagine getting thousands of angry petitions from botters and see how you would feel and react. He has a crappy Job, it is unrealistic to expect every botter to be treated as a valued and important member of society, and to expect the botters to tell the truth, so they don't and he doesn't.
---
Getting rid of botters will make the game better, not starting hate campaigns against those who work to purge them.
---
If you are innocent, It must hurt, I appreciate that, If you are not innocent, let it hurt, You deserve NOTHING.
---
so say we all.
---
it is a  downloadable content, tell me your not downloading codes from ccp so you can get those skins and a bunch of money?  god knows who you are but your not helping the question. i wish you retire from this post, pretty please with sugar on top. you are just here to argue a point about DLC. i hope i havent offended your ego too much. ;)

They really don't. It is about using the right tool for the job.

Sure, If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail, but sometimes you need a scalpel.

---
1] I'm often on this post to help, but nothing prevent from arguing about something in this thread as long as you're not being an asshole. If you don't want to argue nobody force you to argue back.
---
2]  You don't download what you are buying. You use it and it credit your account with a bunch of items. It's unlockable content, items you can purchase on a store, micro-transactions. Definitely not DLC. There is absolutely no data download between your computer and CCP servers. If CCP marketing team was not stuck with a vision of 10 years ago in regards to advertising what they are selling, we would know it, but it's not the case.
---
3] Skins aren't content, neither is IG money or subscription time but I guess this is a more debatable subject.

What, you can't use EVE via VPN??? What if I want to play over public wifi (airport, cafe, hotel etc) without exposing my information to potential hackers, or somewhere that blocks online games (work, school etc)?

OOF

I heard gigx can help with that.

Man LeeChanka FCing nadoes again. What is this, 2012?

I don't play other games, so when we are in dull pauses like the current one I either krab or gate camp - the dullest activities, but it is still something to do until activity server wide pick back up.

Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.

Didn't CCP even tell the Russians to use a VPN to connect because of them getting access blocked?
---
Or am I remembering wrong?
---
I recently returned to Eve and I've been exploring in a heron, I've lost 2 so far and made around 70mill isk.

That's like 10mill/hour, what am I doing wrong?

---
Yeah, reason I put (sometimes) in there :p

Sometimes we get fights with local miners or small gangs but yes its nothing compared to what it used to be like.
---
&gt;Is it common to multibox in EVE?
---
yes, very. more common than pretty much any other game.
---
&gt;how much am I missing out by not multiboxing? 
---
you never 'miss out' on anything in eve, there are just things you can't or won't do.
---
&gt;I imagine some of you guys are able to command an entire solo fleet and pvp with like 5 ships
---
yes we do 20+ at times
---
&gt;Should I be considering this in the near future?
---
if you want, it's not easy.
---
&gt;, It would make doing level 2s easier and so on.
---
single ships can do lvl 4s reliably, like battleships

  Amarr yes!

Welcome to the club. I had all my account chain banned a few months ago for the same reason. It took 32 days for the ticket to be addressed. Once I received my first reply it took another 48 hours for the bans to be over turned.  
---
I know there isn't a rule against VPNs, but honestly, it's not worth it. Especially if you're using a public one.  
---
Good luck.
---
I feel like now is the time to come clean....
---
First off i want to appoligise to the eve community, it was never my intention to mislead you. For that i am truley sorry.
---
For i guess now the last two months when time permits i have been rp'ing a bot on a few of my characters in an order to fit in with the current eve player base. I knew this was wrong, and i fall on the dildo shaped sword of ccp mercy.
---
I have been pretending to afk vexor navy issue cruiser class boats in an assorted variety of space anomalies, all the while furiously staring at my screens waiting for someone to tackle me in my thirst for pvp content that someone was obviously agreeable to but is so very hard to find amongst the bots i keep honorably challenging to 1 V 1's.
---
For the many many people who died to those vnis  i am sorry from the bottom of my heart for not being afk and dunking you. It was wrong, i realise now that i should have not been so flippant with you're elite solo ratter killing skills.
---
I hope the ccp community can find it inside your hearts to forgive me.
---
Yours sincerely,
---
Huntedmaster.
---
just no, there is still data being transferred from some where. this is what a dlc and thats what ccp named it.   it brings me back to the same argument transgender people have about being man but thinking they are a women. YOU CANT CHANGE THAT. same with DLC. CCP named it and grouped it as DLC, YOU CANT CHANGE THAT.  calling CCP retarded is just bad in my books, calling anyone retard is bad and racist. regardless of time spent in this forum being forum warrior, it doesn't give you benefits. 
---
i am so sorry for you. but please lets carry on this conversation. you still don't have a point.

For about 6 months last year using a VPN was the only way I could get a stable connection to eve as my isp had some weird routing issues that timed out. 
---
Tbh I chalked up the issues to the new chat (or perhaps failure to chat would be a better definition) servers. Was convinced the connections to these caused the routing issues which seemed to be better with VPN on.
---
No it take like an hour and 1.7 tril Isk.
---
&gt;Was working form home and had to turn on VPN to access couple sites (nothing shady, just network issues).
---
What kind of network issues were you having that prompted you to use a VPN? It may be worth seeking help resolving them so that you don't need to use something that may get you banned from services like EVE in the future.
---
&gt; just no, there is still data being transferred from some where. this is what a dlc and thats what ccp named it
---
It's not because there is an internal data transfer that's it's a download, you activating modules when playing isn't downloading, in what kind of logic fallacy are you falling ?
---
&gt; it brings me back to the same argument transgender people have about being man but thinking they are a women. YOU CANT CHANGE THAT.
---
What have transgender to do with any of that ?
---
&gt;  CCP named it and grouped it as DLC, YOU CANT CHANGE THAT
---
CCP named it wrongly. I cannot change the fact that CCP is shit at marketing but I can point it out and refuse to name it that way.
---
&gt; alling CCP retarded is just bad in my books, calling anyone retard is bad and racist.
---
Says the guy you use his refusal to accept someone trans identity as an example.
---
&gt; regardless of time spent in this forum being forum warrior, it doesn't give you benefits.
---
Never said it was benefiting in any way.
---
&gt; i am so sorry for you. but please lets carry on this conversation. you still don't have a point and my question still havent been answered ;)
---
Dude. You're caps locking. You sure you're ot letting your ego a little bit too much in this conversation ?
---
Micky is my old friend and good AT-pilot, so I promise that you can believe written above.
---
I will believe that CCP will re-investigate this ban/issue.
---
Heya there.
---
I wouldn't recommend getting another char so you can dualbox missions on such a low level. 
---
I recommend rather taking the costs of setting up another account and investing it in your main character. About one plex worth of skill injectors will get you into a well skilled lvl3-4 mission runner easily.
---
Remmember, you can't use two alphas or alpha+omega characters at same time.
---
living in Russia ?
---
 Yes it does suck I had the weirdest glitch yesterday I jumped into a site had a disgusting amount of lag on loading then the entire site didn't load I could see npc brackets gate brackets could attack and be attacked but visually no ship models no effects nothing

I just bought a 3Dconnexion mouse on Ebay for a pretty reasonable price, specifically to try out this feature.

I live in Russia where government has a blacklist of domain names, urls and IP addresses that all ISP's have to follow. Currently there are like 3.6M IP addressed in that list.

Being big doesn't prevent you from making mistakes. Companies are composed of individual and if you think several individual and complexes industry process prevent mistakes from happening you definitely are wrong. Developer btw.
---
&gt; talking about a subject doesn't make me racist, calling some a retard is a different story
---
Racism is straight up referring to a discriminatory act on behalf of someone race. Calling someone a retard for a mistake being made isn't racism. It's harsh criticism, insulting probably, but it's not racism. 
---
&gt; so Samaritan warrior are you going to answer my question, or argue with me about a pointless subject
---
I answered it. CCP is releasing what you consider DLC and what I consider micro-transaction on a regular base.
---
Micky is a good man though, pretty sure this is some CCP FoxFour level of "intelligent" bot detection script. 
---
yes your right about people making mistakes, but still stands they have more experience then YOU, when it comes to do what they are doing. so your point doesnt stand.

''retards'' are a minority and using that as a criticism makes it a racism. so you are saying that naming something DLC and basically the point we are arguing is of a retarded nature. your wrong.
---
they havent released anything like it for about 9months maybe, dont quote me on that. 
---
and my question no answers ...
---
I have no words. Hundreds of bots are online 23/7 for years and CCP does nothing, yet they have retarded auto permaban system that bans real players.
---
Btw they literally recommended russian customers to use VPN to deal with Roskomnadzor - and now they started banning them. For using VPN. 10/10 CCP
---
Is there a way to see how much probe strength I will have with a certain fit without having to buy it and launch probes?
---
My corp, even though we're part of a null group, run a high sec operation. We (and by we I mainly mean a couple guys and there alts with occasional corp support) control a system with an ice belt and gently discourage others from using the system. You'd be surprised at what a few players + alts can make mining in high sec.

&gt;Dual Universe
---
You mean a shiny game that is beautiful, but lacks around 90% of the stuff and depth Eve offers?
---
I don#t see an offer tab anywhere on the account management page.
---
Launcher has 1 person in VIP mode after downtime today. Makes you wonder what they are messing with today.
---
Also, are t4 abyssal filaments ever coming back to Sisi?
---
I got banned about a month ago on an alt account for absolutely nothing. 
---
I made 3 tickets to get a response after 2 weeks where they told me my account has been flagged for some security reasons and I will not be able to extract skills or sell it.
---
It took another week of back and forward, I was prety frustrated at this point, a couple of escalations to the ticket until they came around and said actually we made a mistake.
---
Eve is in a sorry sorry state at the moment on many many fronts sadly
---
Before I started using VPN, I've contacted CCP's Customer Support and has notified them that my IP will vary greatly. I've also added a list of possible countries I might connect from. They have made some notes on their end and I have never had any issues with the connection. 
---
Also, they do store data regarding your hardware, so I doubt the ban is purely cuz your IP has changed: say, when I connect, they don't only see my IP, but also the laptop components of mine. They see that it's the same laptop hopping from one country to another, and I believe that gives them more reason to **not** ban me. 
---
Reach out to their customer support and if nothing happens within several days - send another one. Repeat the cycle until you get an update. Good luck
---
Simulate the fit, look at the probe launcher and click the little "i" button beneath the module that says charge information. You should be able to see the strength there :)
---
If not load the fitting into pyfa and look at the probe strength there.
---
The riskier the better when it comes to exploration. Wormholes and nullsec is where the money is. Just watch out, make sure you know what you're warping into in WHs, many of those data sites have guns/sleepers what will murder you.

One plex is ~3 mil. You won't get many injectors for that.
---
Serious question - why do you think that?
---
What hold on, you got banned for using a VPN? CCP actually encouraged Russian people to use one during the Russian gov. crackdown on the Amazon server which houses the ingame eve chat services. https://www.eveonline.com/article/p7e6fr/problemy-s-podklyucheniem-k-igre-na-territorii-rf
---
&gt; yes your right about people making mistakes, but still stands they have more experience then YOU, when it comes to do what they are doing. so your point doesnt stand.
---
My point does stand. "They are more experience hence they know better" isn't an argument against my point. Let's hear against your definition of what downloading is please ? You've come to this "they know better" argument because your own have failed because you clearly have no idea what you are talking about.
---
&gt; ''retards'' are a minority and using that as a criticism makes it a racism. 
---
Minorities are not a race, races can be a minority. Discriminatory would be the correct word.
---
&gt; so you are saying that naming something DLC and basically the point we are arguing is of a retarded nature. your wrong.
---
At this point you have fallen into some pretty deep holes during this exchange that qualifying this whole conversation as retarded is indeed of retarded nature. But that's insulting toward conversations. I mean, they are a minority after all, and you have no right to bully them the way you are doing to this poor conversation.
---
What you can do it to create a new account, keep it alpha but you train the toons on this one with the basic fitting skills and some other things you want.
---
So if one day you want to use a second toon you can have a "headstart" on the character skills
---
They removed filament market seeding to avoid people trying out on Sisi to easily. But you can still run the T1 filament up to the point you loot T4 and try out on Sisi.
---
i found a way to juice up my profits in industry and manufacturing...
---
Make faction battleships (barghest for an example) put a batch of them in a JF and hrad to jita
---
With ENAMs going for a bil and multi module drops from the some sites 3 t3cs and a dedicated prober can make surprising isk in lowsec with cheap fits. Not quite C5 money but there's no downtime, much smaller isk/effort investment and as an added bonus even the most desperate of our local blobbers won't bother with 3 t3cs in a plex. Lots of our peeps seem to do PI on week long cycles too, can't speak to it personally but apparently it's worth the effort to them.
---
That said once you have a few bill spare spinning up indy/market alts is still the key to good, low effort living. Only ever doing PVE to help out stubborn corpies who refuse to embrace the few clicks a week lifestyle makes Eve a much more relaxed experience.
---
GL with it.

I don’t get it.

Settling in the 5-5 WH and running sites with a few spidertanked Nestors. You will need an Astrahus and, like, a few spidertanked nestors

---
please learn to read post,  your the one saying this whole idea is retarded. i m only repeating what YOU said, to back my point.
---
again your just wrong, ''retards'' as you name it, is a minority like you agreed. using them as a criticism a harsh one (your words), makes it racism and again. so you been here one year, being a keyboard warrior, because that is what this is. just trying to swing your downloadable content)virtual penis around. just like a DLC, only the difference is that, you are using that to gain some virtual stats which will mostly be forgotten by the end of the day. 
---
are you really this petty? i mean if you only had read the very first question on this thread and analysed like a normal human. but instead you called people retard and told others to learn to the difference between dlc and shopping or whatever word you like to use  
---
 
---
more faction supercarriers with more unique bonuses (like the revenant) that aren't just burst projector related
---
navy variants would be cool too, amarr/caldari could have a small (1 or 2%) resist bonus and gallente/minmatar could get a 8th tank slot. they would also have a gun damage bonus and cost 1 regular titan hull + 15-30b in other cap parts - make the LP cost for the BPC a lot too
---
also make pirate titans able to fit a 3m damage focus DD (1.5m of each damage type) but make it 3 times the activation cost of the regular focus dd
---
Err, congratz? 
---
Exploration makes money in null. Also, it's random. You should be at about 50-70mill per hour if you're doing it right. And specific areas make better money than others. Do some research.
---
CCP do you really think that making shitty EA-style mobile free-to-play events is better than actually support your loyal playerbase?
---
It's kind of tolerable if that is the only way CCP can fight bots *now*. But they have to have adequate customer support policies.
---
&gt; are you really this petty? i mean if you only had read the very first question on this thread and analysed like a normal human. but instead you called people retard and told others to learn to the difference between dlc and shopping or whatever word you like to use

Personally I'm in Dromedaworks Inc and am enjoying it. 
---
well is that a defeat?  i win at your own game. 
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Missions
---
You'll need standings - likely with the corp you want to run with (as faction standings take a shitton longer). However if you have enough faction standings you'll be able to do missions with ANY corporation in that faction.
---
You need 5.0+ standings for level 4 missions, which can be done entirely in highsec. Level 5 missions are much more lucrative, but can only be done in low-sec (with ocassional dips into null). 
---
You can also do level 4s in lowsec if you want, because the LP rewards scale upwards as security of the system you're running in goes down.
---
So what you'll need beforehand is...
---
-A decently fit T1 battleship (or a marauder, or a T3 strategic cruiser)
---
-An idea of who you want to run for. Caldari navy is always good, but has been saturated since the beginning of time *because* it's so popular. isk per LP is pretty low. Check http://www.ellatha.com/eve/LP_Stores.asp and find a good store, but don't set off yet... (Maybe sisters of eve, those were good for a while! Dunno if they still are)
---
-After identifying a good store, make sure they actually have agents. Preferably 2 of the preferred level agents in close proximity. This allows you to bounce between missions without much problem
---
-Make sure those agents are not **distribution** agents. Unless you really hate yourself? Distribution agents give transport missions and the like. Not what is usually considered missions.
---
-Find whatever eve mission website is popular nowadays and do a brief glance at the mission before you accept willy nilly. Most people avoid missions vs other (caldari/amarr/gallente/mino) navies to avoid standings hit. Note that raising your faction standings will still lower others from implied standing. But not enough to be a big deal.
---
-When you have your pile of LP you want to convert to cash make doubly sure the item you're cashing out will actually sell. If you're moving *huge* amounts considering finding someone to buy off you wholesale. Also turn your LP into items near a trade hub, so you don't have to lug it 30 jumps to jita.
---
SoE arc starts in Arnon, but with 23M SP you *should* be able to jump into 3's or 4's. The rule of thumb for L4's is that you should be able to add your ship's dps output to its ehp/sec of tank and get ~1000. So, 850dps and 150ehp/s should get you through. Almost any well-fit battleship should be able to put out numbers close to that.
---
That amount gives you 2 mil per fit, which isn’t enough. You need 10-15 for it to work well, in my experience. So, that gives you room for 100 to 67 ships. 
---
Still a good idea 
---
LEFT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT NO NO RIGHT RIGHT OK NOW LEFT LEFT...
---
Drifting on ice would be amazing
---
Totally forgot about those for some reason. Yeah that would do it
---
Man I need to read more of you, it's great for my every day moral.
---
The problem isn't that he was using a VPN, but that some habitual botter/exploiter probably used the same VPN and CCP blacklisted the IP addresses (so they couldn't come back with yet another account).  CCP's got to come up with a better system to address this kind of thing.  :\\
---
I used to scan down sites and run combat signatures like 7/10s, 8/10s and 10/10s in nullsec.
---
There wasn't a pirate version of Minmatar Battleship at the first place
---
Next post
---
We barely had any numbers advantage, and why bring blingy ships if you’re not able to protect them?
---
Heavy A^(steroid) Cruiser
---
Blaster are the most dps.
---
Polarized Talos/vindi should have the most dps. 
---
To keep it realistic, I'd say a polarized Hecate/bomber
---
Its a solid consistent income though, which is why its so strong.
---
The other methods mentioned above can vary based om alot of unknowns
---
So if I was to polarize a Hecate what weapons would I use?
---
I did WHs but the last 15 WHs I've been only had sites with rats, so couldn't do them in a frig.
---
Yesterday I was in nullsec (syndicate region) and it took 30 mins to even find a site, just to have some roamers disturb me all the time.
---
Rats are the problem, they insta kill my frig, any suggestions?
---
I would recommand doing DED sites in lowsec,
---
There is a great Part of lowsec that is dead and you can easily doing this sites, usally you will find some Scanner But eazy isk brain afk
---
Trillions of profit from the TTT? Does the TTT even make a profit after fuel cost?
---
Torpedos

Any tips?  
---
I did WHs and it worked great until recently, 15 of my last WHs only had sites with rats so I couldn't do them.
---
I switched to nullsec systems but it took me 30 mins to find a single site and there's too much pvp going on, roamers disturb the exploration.
---

Can't let this post go without this little gem.
---
you trying to play my game now. 
---
That was exactly what i said earlier and you did exactly what i wanted. 
---
i mean you put so much effort on your post, with good grammar, quoting and all that. i m so happy for you. 
---
you gave up not me. i m here to teach you a lesson and like i said this will all be forgotten in a few hours. you are going to be doing what you normally do and i will be doing the same.  thanks for the win here today, may our paths cross again. 
---
Don't try to run those sites in a frigate, they're a different sort of site.
---
Can't ban bots, can ban legit players. WORKING AS INTENDED.

Polarized Blasters?

Do you have to then claim it? Or is it automatic
---

---
Thank you, I've been contemplating getting some Plex for my main and hence why I want to see if its better to invest into another toon now or not. I thinkn Ill take your advise and invest some Plex in my current toon before moving to multibox.
---
Should have brought more friends. Adapt or die, eve is an empire building game. Oh sorry wrong thread. Wtf is this thread even.
---
Yes, there is a lot of multiboxing, but until you get to capital ships (where being able to self-cyno is a big advantage), you don't have to if you don't want to. It does mean you'll need a friend to scout for you, or move your stuff around unscouted, which slightly restricts what you can do.
---
Missions suck in general but you can skill into bigger ships on your main if you want to run higher level ones.
---
Remember that to multibox you need to Omega all the relevant accounts so it costs you an extra 1.6bn ISK (or RL £) for each extra client you want to run. If you are doing it for PVE you need to increase your return by at least that much.
---
Thank you!
---
I think his point is still right though. Get a shit ton of your favorite ship and lose them all
---
&gt; i mean you put so much effort on your post, with good grammar, quoting and all that
---
That's what most people do and it requires about 0 effort.
---
For the rest, I'm really happy our conversation is giving you some kind of ego trip because it's definitely making it entertaining.
---
So look at your question. Look at the Hecate. Look at its bonuses. Then think about what else you might have overlooked in life
---
Can confirm Micky never make anything against EULA.
---
Could do proteus. Any t3c will do.

It's probably detected a sudden change in region or something like that with the different IP address you'll be using with the VPN.

Thank you I just figured out what I overlooked in life. Even though I love Eve and the community there are still some people that are. Well let's just keep it at that. 
---
multiboxing isn't needed. You can try to find people to do the stuff you can't do. I think multiboxing is either a sign of to few people in the game or the people that multibox can't or won't talk to people. I multibox 4 accounts.
---
its nice that you think that, i can sense that from 50 words per post or so, you have gone down to a lot less.
---
my ego has always been at a steady level. you know what takes even less effort? just reading someones post properly and typing in whatever comes into your mind, no quoting no organizing in numbers, and the rest. it takes no effort or even less effort then your zero effort. why did you do all that for the end result to be, quitting? 
---
i m so sorry, maybe you will learn to read questions a lot better from now on :D
---
&gt;also make pirate titans able to fit a 3m damage focus DD         
---
This can be bit dangerous in current meta, as most of the faction Titans BPC is dropping in north due to 'bugged' Sotiyo spawn mechanic. 
---
Hi, I'm just popping by to mention that /u/Mauti404 is correct and calling those packs DLC is pretty retarded. I think it may have had something to do with paid DLC being a supported feature on Steam, unlike... "account upgrades"? Or whatever would be a more accurate term. 
---
Also chill the fuck out my dude, and how would anyone here possibly know if/when they were gonna add more of those packs?

Iceland is in the EEA, their data is hosted in London (afaik.) Both of these are subject to the GDPR.

Companies aren't allowed to make automated processing decisions on your account, without some user input if you query it. So there has to be a human decision.
---
There's some caveats in the regs that allow for automated usage when it comes to the security of the company infrastructure, but my understanding of the policy is limited.
---
As far as I'm aware, no-one has pushed hard against a computer games customer services department about enforcing their rights granted by the GDPR yet, but someone smarter than I should.

I live in the UK, if I wanted to make a complaint in relation to the handling of my data by a company, I'd start here - https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/

No, dont call the company lol, that's just the nature of wifi.  
---
youre either going through a couple thick walls (if so use 2.4 ghz) the radio is broken (test by using other devices) or you have a lot of RF  interference and you need to do a wireless survey to check if all the channels are landing on the same group.

Calling the fibre company about bad wifi is like reviewing a meal based on what your shit smells like. 
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
Not sure that's really fair. 'POS code' is a meme for a reason, and citadel code seems to be relatively good.
---
I think ccp need more player in their game so if they permabanned you it s because of something. They dont do it for the pleasure because they loose money for it.
---
interesting. got a link to where it was announced?
---
It's hard to explain. Most people use multi boxing to run their main and either a capital alt, or a support alt (scout, ceptor, cyno, dictors, booster, etc). If you are bad like me and 95% of this game player base, you generally use an alt that doesn't require much attention when your main requires attention.
---
To give an example if I go roam I will have my main in a somewhat DPS ship and my alt in a ceptor, my alt will generally arrive first on grid, will hold tackle while I only have to travel with my main, and when my main arrive on grid and (generally) hold tackle I can put less attention on my ceptor and in case he can die quickly, I just make in MWD away to he can warp back when I need his help. Capital alts are another example, they generally target other capital and have less modules to use (dreads are literally jump, siege, put guns on target and you're good until you need to switch target, although that's for buffer dread, active dreads require more attention). Microing 2 ships are the same time is quite intense, quite fun but also very prone to mistakes. So in regards to PvP, it's pretty useful but generally speaking Eve isn't a 1 player and all his alts versus another player and all his alts set up. And mutli boxing past 3 alts it's quite hard. I know my alliance isn't super fond of people multiboxing a main DPS and an alt logistic (think space priest) because they think they have a good amount of logistics afterwards when in reality they have less efficient logistics with slower reaction time and attention. In small gang situation, it does matter because you cannot +1 your way out of it.
---
In regard to isk making, yes another alt is always good, but it also mean twice the boredom because isk making is boring and you might not have a 3rd screen to look at youtube in the meanwhile, except maybe for mining.
---
&gt; I was thinking if I had two level 1 ships setup, It would make doing level 2s easier and so on. Thoughts and advice appreciated.
---
Level 2 aren't any better. My advise would be to get the hell out of HS and do not run missions before they crush your will to play this game. 
---
No, it can affect any system. Most of the time you wouldn't notice if the local list was wrong, though.
---
What's worrying is that only 2 of 3 accoints linked to the same email got banned. So if he was a legit rmter one account linked to the same email got away scot free

---
WINMATAR FTW
---
Wasn’t the Mittani in charge by then? They mention his name at the start, and I thought it said he took over before 2009 in the Empires of Eve book. 
---
&gt; its nice that you think that, i can sense that from 50 words per post or so, you have gone down to a lot less.
---
Mostly because you've reach a point where providing you with arguments is pointless since you're clearly not here to received any input or argue about it. And also you keep saying fucked up shit either way so it's still entertaining.
---
Personally, I would take a look at the pirate epic arcs. I found them a hell of a lot of fun and there is danger involved as it's all in nullsec but you're flying an interceptor so it shouldn't be too much of a problem.
---
Although perhaps to start the sisters of EVE might be better.
---
Once you have standings with the empires, if you do missions for them, you can do the empire epic arcs which are also a lot of fun, relative to other PVE.
---
Amarr has the most active roleplayers, so if you’re into that stuff choose them or minmatar 
---
The last piece of your advise really hits home for me. I think by playing these damn agent missions its making it so repetitive and boring that it made me consider multiboxing, especially when I see so many content creators for EVE doing it. Made me feel like "well shit, I can't compete if I don't multibox" Hence the post.
---
So I'm totally for leaving HS but where should I go? What do I do? I obviously want to PVP but want to get prepared for it first ya know? In terms of skills, ships, mods and whatnot. 
---
I'd add looking at social tab of skills and learning some of them as those increase payouts and speed of gaining standings.
---
you know what is the worse part? i m still wasting your time by coming here and doing your zero effort quoting, spacing, numbering stuff.
---
can you believe this is my very first post ever in reddit :o 
---
no, you are obviously ok with being dumb though
---
It literally isn't. He's asking for the wallets of alliance leadership to be investigated by CCP because he got kicked for shooting blues. He's not just asking CCP to "investigate the botting activity of that alliance".
---
Getting blacklisted from the biggest alliance ingame for a few bil, what could possibly go wrong?
---
Only use sites which have a pirate-faction name in Wormholes, and no "Sleeper" in the name. Those are the ones without Rats, and are pretty profitable in WormholeSpace.

they are 30m and 37m long respectively with little-to-no editing at all.
---
if you want these to do well and take off:
---
1) use some kind of editing. speed them up a bit. perhaps include comments about a fight, why is it interesting, what were you thinking - see the recent popular abyssal video which did both these things well.
---
2) use less generic music than boom-boom-boom techno/trance/whatever-it-is

I'll throw in my 2 cents:   
---
Stay for a bit longer, practice pvping more and try to make more money. Meanwhile you train an alt in trading skills and read up on margin trading and get into buying things for a dollar and selling for two.
---
Yep, just grab some buddy invite while it was nerfed by CCP i think it will still give you 250k SP as initial gift. 
---
Where are your own examples? 
---
In whs look for pirate named one. Guristas, blood raider etc.. rest have rats.
---
Also focus on relic sites.
---
In nullsec, use your map. You can filter the statistics to learn about which pockets are more frequented. Dont just stick to the 'main road'. Check dead ends etc. Most likely a lot of sites congregated there. Also go for gurista and sansha regions as those relic sites have the most valuable loot. Id recommend gurista. Much less competetion there.
---
Also it goes without saying that you ahould go in and out of null via wormholes.
---
You can use thera cnnections too. Google it.
---
Also consider looking up Signal Cartel. They are the best people you will ever find on the internet.
---
Multiboxing won't make the game more enjoyable, just provide you with a few more opportunities so achieve some stuff alone instead of with people. Eve isn't really about competing but having enjoying that quite complex sandbox that we have. You won't be able to always go for a situation, because even with 20 alts it would be suicide. Eve PvP is a lot of patience before a great action packed moment. Suicide rarely is worth it.
---
&gt; So I'm totally for leaving HS but where should I go? What do I do? I obviously want to PVP but want to get prepared for it first ya know? In terms of skills, ships, mods and whatnot.
---
According to your mindset, a LS FW corp or a WH one are what you are looking for. They both provide with good isk making for new comers, sometimes freely provided ships, roles in fleet for them and generally plenty of occasion to have some alone PvP options. Check r/evejobs for some adverts.

all this could have been avoided if you didn't have your head stuck up your own arse. i am soo sorry for your loss. you are still providing me with arguments. you said yourself that you were going to stop but yet you are still here, feeding me with your ignorance and lack of self. 
---
i m a hero for the guys who come here and ask a modest, yet truthful question and get pummeled by keyboard warriors like yourself. before internet, 2 kids who had a problem with each other would go to a car park and fight each other and after that they were probably good friends, the argument probably not solved but it didn't matter anyway. 
---
the internet has made the world weak, with people talking about zoomers and boomers, memes, people getting offended about every little thing from reading other peoples questions and getting it wrong to trying to keep up some virtual status that will all be forgotten within a few hours. 
---
it is time for you to wake up, the real world is out there, crying to be part of your life, imploring for you to stop this none sense  of virtual dicks, your soul mate imploring for you to stop spending time in the virtual world and give her some attention, the ideas of your future life fruits terrorized by it!
---
please, stop. check yo self, rewind and all that. you probably think i hate you, or think that you are retard, as you would use it. i dont, i just want the world to be a better place, i want all to be fair and friendly to each other. 
---
we should love each other, not by what gender you think you are, or colour, or background or virtual dick. just a big orgy of love and happiness 
---
Yes, make the rags rock pirate titan a angel titan and everyone is happy
---
here's a code :]

I’ve found it to be pretty challenging. I’m in an assault frig, solo except when I bring an alt (rare).  I have to convince someone to shoot at me.  Everything I go after can one shot me, so I have to manually pilot well.  I’ve got to take down drones, while keeping tackle. If they have friends, I’m even more challenged.  And I don’t need to log in for a fleet, worry about getting home, etc.  I think you’d be surprised at the skill involved
---
Just write a ticket with the topic "problems with payment" 
---
and then say: you payed for the accounts but arent able to use them. Ist kinda reasonable.
---
they will react way faster cause its about money :&gt;
---
here's one: https://www.eveonline.com/signup/?invc=872cdd9a-49b4-45e1-954e-eadf51eb8fc1
---
if you end up signing up just let me know and I'll toss ya ISK equal to whatever reward I get
---
I'm a director in Total Mayhem, a smaller PvP-focused entity, and our members have a wide variety of methods of making ISK:
---
* Highsec incursions;
---
* Exploration;
---
* Abyssals;
---
* Alts in nullsec sov alliances;
---
* Market trading;
---
* Scamming...
---
The difference tends to be that groups like ours are less able to hold your hand when it comes to making ISK -- we're happy to give you advice but there's a limited amount that we can actually do when it comes to securing and supplying your income.
---
Take a look at the abyssal sites
---
It’s much better than regular mission 
---
Fucking jackpot here I knew it was worth it to keep digging.
---
Thx for the tips
---
I did some editing and included some comments at the Beginning of each fight. I also speeded the longer ones up(some fights were 10 min long - not much sense to speed a 2 min fight up - see the other vid, half of it was the Vedmark vs Vedmark fight). Also see the Vedmark fight in the middle of the 2nd vid, there I put comments on it. I can't really add more comments as the Preview window of Windows movie maker laggs like hell when I speed things up(already at 1.25x). 
---
Does the music really matter? I have seen videos with Goatrance, heavy metall and all different kinds of music. And some got popular.(See my Legion C3 Timelapse from 2016, it has over 20k views and has similar music)
---
Go..... MINE.... like a real Eve player.  Fuck me sideways who let you post here?
---
You are not wrong. CCP even wrote it as a message in the launcher. 
---
this happened to me about 10 years ago, they overturned the ban. it took a couple weeks though.
---
I submitted a ticket stating that due to my job I will periodically be connecting from a VPN, but the connection will never come from outside of the US. They replied back that they annotated this on my account and closed the ticket. I have connected multiple accounts on a VPN a handful of times with no issue. If you let them know before hand, they generally don't have an issue. I believe the mechanic is there to prevent people who have previously been permabanned from creating new accounts.
---
I'd rather they balance existing capitals before adding in new ones personally. 
---
I agree too with the wi-fi point.
---
At some point I was desperate and made "Halp! Nobody reading my tickets!" ticket. Guess what - still waiting for response ,-)
---
I don't think spamming Support with tickets is a good idea. They have a lot of work to do and it's not their fault that they have such policies.
---
very sus
---
Some people that are... So bad at this game, they can't look at a ship saying "bonus to small hybrid guns" and interpret that to mean they should look for small polarized hybrids? 
---
Sure, fighters need better application.         
---
It is just so unbalanced now that small caliber weapons from fighters cannot apply well to stuff like frigates.         
---
In terms of caliber size - frigate weapons are 2-3 times "bigger" than those on fighters. 
---
Confirmed, did it recently and the recruitee still gets that. It's a fairly nifty bonus even if the recruiter keeps the rewards themselves!
---
Recruiter gets rewards? Last time i heard those where skins ... lol
---
Some people would say fell played good flying yadda yadda yadda, but you literally won the fights cause of ec-300 ECM procs. Without those drones i doubt you would have won any of the fights.
---
What?
---
That’s so wrong tho, plenty of ways to live without grinding ist, like gibt 6 rorqs Feed them to the goon f1 blob and get all the 15b loot
---
Wow I just realized about thing. You arrive the same category as the other gentlemen and I use that ten loosely. I am new to the game so I apologise that I am still trying to wrap my head around it all. And by the time it takes you to type and reply wouldn't be easier to give an answer or not waste your time an reply at all?
---
I feel you. It took me a long time to realize why you fit some ships with lasers, some were drone boats and so on because I never realized ships had bonuses tied to them. I meant that to come out nicer as more of a “is there a situation in life that this is similar to” but I apologize I read that again and I sound like an ass. 
---
so now to my first post,
---
 When is CCP bringing out some new dlc? Tired of looking at the same old meteor packs and all the others.... I can't even buy it, because I have already bought it once.... It's a year old man! 
---
Skins and clothes and BPCs and guff based on number of recruits. But if the recruitee upgrades to omega or buys Plex or DLC packs at any point in the future then the recruiter also gets Skill Extractors and Accelerators and Plex, with no time limit (so even if recruitee only makes a purchase a year in, there's a reward appearing in the recruiter's redemption queue).
---
Some folk offer to pay isk value of the bonus rewards or transfer them to the newbie because they want to up the number of recruits one (20 recruits gets you 2000 Plex, which isn't horrific for literally free), but some want the potential future loot-drop, and even if it's the latter, the recruitee gets 250k SP free and clear, which is a lot for a new player especially on Alpha mode.
---
Sorry to hear that
---
&gt; They are just likely busy dealing with crushing botters.
---
Good one!
---
Well again depends, if you consider skins DLC there are plenty of new ones added on the store on a regular basis. If they are not a DLC to you then I don't know what does so please explain yourself a bit more.
---
A lot of people wouldnt see leaving goons as a bad thing
---
&gt;involved as it's all in nullsec but 
---
I believe the Angels epic arc starts in low-sec Heimatar; that being said, I have never run any of the epic arcs--pirate or otherwise. Most of my eve career has been spent ganking people who are trying to run epic arcs. 
---
Thank you so much I really appreciate that. Thank you for the help mate. No hard feelings. 
---
Biggest problem for getting into missions are the standings. First look at the faction standings: If you have &lt;=-2.0 in one faction, you can only fly level 1 missions for all their corporations, which is absolutely terrible.
---
If faction is above -2.0, you can do missions according to the highest standing in faction, corp and individual agent. Magic numbers are: 1.0 for Lvl2, 3.0 for Level 3, 5.0 for Level 4 missions.
---
If one faction is above one of these numbers, you can do the higher level missions for all their corps, so you should start there. You can do the SoE epic arc first, this gives a massive boost (~0.8) for one faction. In this faction, choose a corp which has a few Lvl 4 agents of your type close together, ideally in 0.5-0.6 systems. That's much more important than a few hundred ISK/LP more or less. 
---
The standing grind up to 3.0 is slow, boring and very low income. With level 3 missions it becomes easier, because they give much higher standing boosts (and at least some income).
---
You can repeat the SoE epic arc every 90 days for another faction standing boost, and I recomment doing that. If you are already into Lvl 4 missions for one corp, use the boost to repair standings of the opposing factions.
---
like my post said, ''same old meteor packs''. no one is saying skins or whatever, i am asking about the meteor PACKS. if you play eve you will know about them. any idea when more like the meteor dlc packs are being introduced again?
---
Mate I use VPN all the time, and my VPN sometimes dies and I loose internet connection in the middle of the mining, i panic like a motherfucker, then I turn off my VPN. After that I log back in and continue mining. Nothing has happened so far. Probably you got reported for some activity. 
---
Here is what I will add, because everyone who has commented has given you good advice. As a part time mission runner back in my pirate days, mostly as an avenue to get my sec status back up and look less scary, 23 million SP *should* be enough to run level 4s. 
---
Two caveats here though... first it depends on what those 23 million SPs are in. If you trained 14 million SPs in mining and industry before you decided you wanted to be a 'combat' pilot, you are down to 9 million relevant SPs and then... well, it will be much harder. 
---
Second, to get to those level 4s, as others have said, you will most likely have to grind out level 1s, 2s, and 3s until your standing is high enough. This honestly does not take that long--keep in mind every 16th or 18th (I cannot remember) mission is a 'storyline' mission, which boosts your standings considerably. 
---
Finally, LPs... if you want to maximize value, do not run Caldari Navy missions. I would go with, in no particular order, SoE, Minmatar Republic, or Imperial Navy. Also keep in mind to do your research before spending that LP on items that nobody uses, or wants, or can be found elsewhere (like implants). 
---
The quickest cash is going to always be faction ammo, but if you do a little research and are willing to wait a few days in some cases to sell your Republic Fleet Webbers or what have you, you will make more money; however, this often requires being a part time trader... i.e. parking a character in a trade hub and watching/adjusting your sell order price. 
---
Meteor pack litterally is a package made up of PLEX and skins(s). And skins are bought with PLEX so you just are asking for PLEX sales which happen regulary.  
---
I like exploring so I scan down our chain and run the relic/data sites I find while I'm finding out where the exits are. Wormhole space gives you a variety of different things every day - empty nullsec to explore in, LS/NS to look for targets, PVP in chain, HS for logistics connections.
---
former goon (well, former snuff with a ratting alt in goons) - C3s, end of - not too taxing, not too a high a SP entry, not too pricey to get an OP rattle that can semi afk everything, not going to attract too many big entities if you are careful: 40-50m blue loot anoms, 15/20 mins each/ PI: only outlay being the pocos+time/ explo: in c3 and surrounding systems, reasonable payout. 
---
With a little planning, a couple of accounts and one structure you should be rocking pretty quick - does require a main to do fun stuff with, otherwise it gets shit quick.
---
Yup, way back when Steam had the option of Eve with DLC packs of subscription time and a Starter Pack, so they were already set up to add the bundles and other purchases like Plex and Skill Extractors as DLC when the whole reshuffle came about. Sticking with the existing terminology on CCP's own site just makes sense.
---
Plus much as the packs aren't downloadable content, neither is much DLC these days; the term has come to mean "optional paid-for extras", and whether it's new maps, new characters, or just new shinies, it's still optional and extra and paid for, so the evolved definition fits with the current term usage regardless of the literal meaning of the acronym or it's etymology, and arguing semantics based on outdated terminology is never going to change current common usage.
---
Flairbaits so hard people don't read the name?
---
Thank you. Most of my sp are grated toward combat and hacking exploration etc. Thank you so much for your reply. Thank you all so much. 
---
I had a similar thing happen to me last year. I was traveling overseas and vpn’d into my account to update some orders. Ban hammer came down just the same as you. 
---
Took about 15 days to get a response from CCP and I did get the account back, after jumping through some silly hoops. Never did get an explanation on exactly what triggered the ban, but I too expect the IP address triggered some automated system. 
---
That is almost exactly what I wrote 7 month ago in a very similar topic - https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/8jujaa/psa_banned_for_vpn_just_dont_do_it/dz5aoh1/
---
Bah. As long as you know you don't suffer alone. Here's hoping they find a fix soon, for both of our sanity! :)
---
Stop botting.
---
Also stop botting.
---
What are you doing?
---
Docking
---
**INTERSTELLAR MUSIC INTENSIFIES**
---
Gotta love some Amarr.
---
Their ship look so divine.
---
Well if you really can't handle it with a regular fit you can go full cap recharge with two faction large cap batteries and a good bit of tank low slots.
---
Hell you can do nullsec l4s with &lt;2b investment including injecting characters. They're just hella boring to run.
---
I can very well believe that but advising a newish player to burn a huge bridge like that for low reward?
---
That can bite him in the ass down the road but doesn’t affect you guys at all.
---
But grr gons and all that I guess
---
The question is why though.
---
What is the Noctis lacking? Can't you already nearly 100% salvage everything with perfect skills.
---
A cm rattlesnake could prob do it but its a juicy target for gankers.
---
eh, still waiting on a Caldari/Minmatar pirate faction
---
I like hoodies, lasers and Gold, I don't know much about the slavery part but its a 3 pro vs 1 con.
---
Yep. Love me some Amarr
---
That is how much ISK/h?
---
just afk an orca alt in hisec.
---
I almost got killed in my Machariel while I was taking a piss during this flight because I wasn't aligned. I need a Gatorade bottle.
---
Well TBH i am always bit annoyed that we don't have 'faction' versions of stuff like : Tractor Beams, Cyno generators, rigs .... 
---
The reason is that sometimes you want to bling out some ships ... and yet some items are just basic t1 versions.           
---
Like when you give to someone this mining dreadnought .... you can just put there just this t1 cyno, while you can put in fancy stuff like gallente mining lasers. 
---
You failed again..... What else is those packs made off?
---
Coin dropped yet?
---
I can’t possibly see how GDPR could be related to banning of an account on a service. They can’t send your data to a third party, for sure, but I think this comment is a stretch and part of the GDPR FUD.
---
Look up the wormhole name, you want C1-C3 wormholes.  They contain relic and data sites without rats.  
---
You seem to have forgotten that it's the time of the year that Reddit hates Goons.
---
It explains why they get so upset when you whore on them.
---
Waste of a billion ISK, especially as he can join Brave or Karma and get free frigates to do that.
---
This, and make the Noctis a destroyer-sized hull with decent agility so it's actually useful.
---
Just keep it.  Accumulate ISK both as a buffer for hard times and to improve your character over time.  
---
Now that I looking at the thread, I don't see many people suggesting Minmatar at all.
---
Greetings Mate, I do usually all above the 6/10 with the Paladin, it is a bit pricey but totally worth
---
Roughly, yes. You get 15min vulnerability, then a 24 hour invulnerable anchoring period, then another 15min vulnerability window. There's a 24 hour cooldown on wardecs before fighting is open, so as long as you don't get wardecced within 15mins after the first vulnerability window ends, it can anchor safely; before that and there's a possibility of a drop during the second window (however without caps/supercaps it's unlikely they can kill it off within the second window unless they're a massive group, which will be tough to organise in HS on such short notice).
---
Your big problem will be the visibility of the structure during anchoring. Once it's deployed fully, you can restrict access so folk will have to scan for it to find it, but it's fully exposed during that 24.5 hours of deployment. Might be worth watching to see who pops in to bookmark it during that period, if you can afford the bodies to pull babysitting shifts, just to know who may be a risk later on.
---
I'd also check with existing locals to see if there's any agreements in place. Whilst you don't really get renters in HS, you do get corps with links to large wardec corps or ganker corps, and they may see you as a threat to resources/industry index and employ their friends to push you out. Have a chat with the owners of any existing structures, if they're active, and see if they seem protective of "their" space to evaluate if it's going to be a potential headache setting up shop there. Ditto if it's overly quiet it may be because it's a tanking hotspot, so check zkill for structure deaths and see if there's one group in particular harassing residents, or if there's a disturbingly high number of ship drops by suicide ganker, because again you may find it not worth the fight.
---
It's not that much of a bridge. And the reward is better than you think.
---
If you are jobless pleb with infinite amount of time do lowsec missions with bombers or incursions. If you have a life wannabe stop being jew and buy a sub.
---
Well, I'm not really into RP but I into the lore.
---
Another reason why this game caught my attention.
---
Everyone use them, Gwyn jam me litteraly two time with a set of Ec-600, yet wasn't It a very close fight ? 
---
Since the revamp they are lockable even If you are jammed, and easy to remove, an usefull tool indeed but not a broken one.
---
Sure. But I’m assuming this is a somewhat experienced player given he has a bil to throw away. 
---
Did someone say rework the Eris?
---
If hes not enjoying goons now I doubt he will in the future. There are thousands of other corps and alliances to join, hes not exactly lacking in choices.
---
I'd be all up for a T2 Noctis if it would be something specialized like better speed and maybe CovOps for smaller Cargohold
---
Tickets with no content will surely make all other tickets resolved faster.
---
The faction you pick is for your background and physical appearance. It does not stick you into a faction.
---
However, as a new player, you had better to focus your skills training on one race and 1 or 2 types of damage output. As the majority of the comments done for your topic, I would advice to go for Gallente. Their ships are armor and self-repairing oriented, good for PVE and solo/small gang pvp. They have bonus for drones which are considered as the best damage dealers for PVE, just see the Vexor navy Issue aka N°1 popular isk farmer in Null Sec. Afterwards, you have the hybrid weapons which are viable even as meta 4 (Tech 1) for PvP.
---
In the case you are planning to get an Omega Clone, you can go with Minmatar. This faction is worth the skill points spent on it because:
---
1. They have popular ships and *some considered the best per class* in the current meta; some examples: Stiletto (*best interceptor*), Sabre (*best interdictor*), Huginn (*Very deadly in fleet and small gang*), Loki (*Best T3C*), Naglfar (*best dreadnought*), Nidhoggur (*Best ratting and pvp carrier*), Hel (*the must-have super)*, Ragnarok (*align time)*
---
2. They fit very well in Armor or Shield fleets doctrines so you will always find a place in a fleet
---
3. Highly capable in solo, small gang and fleet
---
You can focus like 2-3m sp into BS and still do level 4s, they're brain dead easy.
---
Ah, fair play. It's been a long time since I last did them so I'm not surprised my memory is a little whacked. 
---
Thanks though. Without people like you they wouldn't be anywhere near as much fun. A large part of it for me was figuring out how to break through or navigate around gate camps and hunters.
---
Well Goonwaffe was formed in 2010 after the whole Goonfleet disbandment debacle and Mittani took over then. when DJ returned AFAIK he was able to persuade CCP to return goonfleet to him as he was the last CEO. I don’t exactly remember who was in charge in 09 as it was a year I was winning Eve and when I came back goonfleet was gone, Goonwaffe had been formed and mittens was in charge. 
---
Eve matchmaker
---
You won't get an actual answer here, as fellow players we can only guess.
---
That said, I would assume they'll be wary of adding new microtransactions in the wake of the Pearl Abyss investment, given how much wailing and rending of garments came from the assumption Eve would become a microtransaction wasteland ruled by credit card warriors. That craziness has only just subsided, and new cash-buyable stuff will bring that back with a vengeance until a bit more time has passed. I'd say next Q4 at the earliest if their marketing team have any sense of self preservation.
---
Is that the back end?
---
IMO this is not a GDPR issue because they have only automated the processing of game data in this instance, not user personal information.
---
most activities don't really "scale" well with multiboxing, for example controlling a whole small gang by yourself doing tackle running logi everything is basically impossible if you're not super good at it, generally PVE stuff is better with more alts, mining is the best I believe as u can basically just keep adding more rorqual accounts without really losing efficiency.
---
Eh, lets not speculate here. Bad guys use VPN. If you connect to a VPN which has been used for, for instance, credit card fraud, you will definitely be banned right away pending investigation. When I was at CCP, this was *not* automated. But lets assume for a second it *is* automated. 
---
GDPR states:
---
&gt; "The data subject shall have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning him or her or similarly significantly affects him or her."
---
In a case like this, the automated ban is 99% of the time done in order to *protect* the user, and protect others. The user rights are not being infringed in the process, nor is any significant harm, or legal effect being forced upon the user. In fact, it actively protects the user, and their private information, as protected under GDPR.
---
Second, Article 22 gives you the right to *not* be subject to it. It does not ban automated decision making. But you must have a recourse to opt out, and get manual decision making. 
---
So I'd caution against knee-jerk, and frivolous complaints. 
---
Pvp, buy t1 frigates as the other person mentioned, or look into spectre fleet if your corporation doesn't have a lot of pvp content. Public fleets can be a fun start.
---
Yes
---
Salvage bubbler?
---
Plex injectors for main first. When you get it in a comfortable level you'll make some money out of it already and you'll know better what to do with your alts 
---
Most battleships can do them just need mjd on them. Main runners though are paliden, sin, phoon and snake.
---
multiboxing accounts has been a thing since EvE started, it's just cus of the nature of the game not cus there's too few people or w/e.
---
you can grind career agent missions in multiple school systems for a quick boost to faction standings to open up many lvl 4 agents.
---
pick one pair of Caldari/Amarr or Gallente/Minmatar then do all of that pairs career agent missions.
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Career_Agents#Career_Agents_Locations
---
2 factions * 3 schools * 5 agents * 10 (ish) missions will get you close to 5.0 faction standings with both of your chosen factions. this will open up lvl 4 agents for half the corps in highsec.
---
So, what you're saying is, you want to enter that.
---
Conclusion is correct, cause is not quite correct. The decision making may have been related to the users IP. The IP is considered PII. 
---
Well apparently I missed something si please enlight me ?
---
[removed]
---
I used to multibox 4 accounts. I now just multibox 2 and I find that sufficient for most things PVE. 
---
The company handles my personally identifying data. I pay them for a service, they use my data, and I have access to some of their data through my interactions with their service. 
---
You could break this down into a couple of broad categories; billing / payment information. Avatar / account information.
---
Article 22 refers to automated decision making, and Article 9 refers to processing of data. 
---
https://eugdpr.org/
---
https://gdpr-info.eu/art-22-gdpr/
---
https://gdpr-info.eu/art-9-gdpr/
---
My limited understanding leads me to believe that customer services cannot ban an account based upon automated decisions or profiling (ban scripts / geoip flagging.) There must be evidence of human interaction.
---
I do not believe the exceptions mentioned in either article are applicable to a large, private, for profit company, that handles data for both adults and children.
---
It's not related to GDPR at all. Also, the assumption in the previous post was that because CCP is subject to GDPR, that the OP has rights under GDPR. The right only exists if the OP is a data subject in a jurisdiction that has adopted GDPR. So the OP only has rights under GDPR if they are from EU/EEA/Euro-area. 
---
I mean, she is a satisfying ship to fly! 
---
I did single account for about a year and recently got a second. 8 got to say that having 2 accounts is pretty nice. Is it required ? Absolutely not. But it devinitely enhances the experience. Until yoy actually know what you are doing do a single accoubt and train an alpha on the side until you decide to double up
---
You'll get the best standings boost from the storyline missions which are offered every 16 completed missions for the same faction.  The catch is, the storyline mission will be offered from the nearest storyline agent, not nessessarly the corp you're wanting to build rep with.  So make sure you have a storyline agent of the corp you're grinding near by or you'll be missing out.
---
What build would you recommend for the phoon?
---
Ah, thanks for the info and correction then.
---
Ah yes of course, the ECJ ruling. One that I completely disagree with. Some ISPs in the UK even give multiple users the same IPV4 address these days due to lack of addresses.
---
A combat/ Fleet specific salvager would be quite interesting. A novel ship for fleets to bring with them for salvaging the battlefield if they hold it. Something more tanky/ interesting than a Noctis.
---
By referencing Article 9, you are implying that CCP processes special categorizes of data. I do not see CCP process any such data, as you are implying. Please clarify. Article 9 is not relevant to CCP. 
---
This is just untrue. End of story.
---
That provision is to prevent profiling (racial, gender, etc) from automatically forwarding data. It is intended to combat profiling based advertising and data sales. Your limited understanding is wrong and one of the many things wrong with GDPR (lack of clear communication resulting in FUD).
---
Do the discount membership/Plex (Galaxy, Star, Meteor etc.) plans available count as paid activations for the purposes of cashing in on referral plans?
---
No worries! In fairness, GDPR is a complicated subject. I've spent way too much time in my line of work dealing with it. So sorry if I came across harsh. But it's so easy to misread, that it's important that these misunderstandings don't grow legs :-)
---
The time stamp on zkillboard, what timezone is that in?
---
t. goonie
---
lmao
---
Yeah, the majority of Tuskers don't have AT winnings to back them up. A couple do - those who _did_ win an AT at some point; everyone else make their ISK differently. Anything from trading/industry, DED/Abyssals to Rorqual mining w/ an alt. :)
---
It's holiday season. CCP are real people, with families and they're always slower round the holiday season. These people are not robots. Just be patient. 
---
You should also stop botting.
---
AOE salvager?
---
Tuskers member checking in.
---
I make most of my ISK from the insurance pay-outs on the hulls I lose, and a small percentage on blingy goon escalations :)

I don't mean to be an arse but perhaps you should take the useful advice that they have given you albeit in a bit of a shitty way rather than reply in an even more shitty way because frankly, they're right and if you looked at the ship you're flying it would have been obvious. 
---
In order to assist you, have you tried using a fitting tool? The ingame tool will do but I prefer Pyfa ([https://github.com/pyfa-org/pyfa/releases](https://github.com/pyfa-org/pyfa/releases)) which allows you to theorycraft fits.

Eve time, Icelandic local time or GMT +0

Mining in a Badger with a civilian miner was the hardcore way to make ISK back in the day.

Not taken harshly at all. It's awesome to be able to have a discussion about it, relevant to gaming with someone who has actual experience with the subject. So thank you.

I can't imagine the amount of red tape and regulations customer services has to deal with compared to when I dealt with similar stuff in 03-04 for another MMO.

I had a similar issue with the launcher (creeping wi-fi connection to the point it was barely useful). I've tried all the things with no success. It is gone now and I have no idea how and why.

Ohh damn... Yeah I can see that happening. Like they say in that article that they do not like it but do it anyways to bypass the Russian firewall. So they care less for banning anyone how used a certain VPN service due to that service been used for botting/RMT.

Do you have the completely retarded idea of salvaging in the middle of a fight, enemy fleets shooting you, your tank holding, your bay filling with salvage while all the f1 monkies arround you do their f1 pressing you making dank isk off their remains?
---
How could salvaging ever become more interesting? 
---
I just left NS to do some light game play without having to spam d-scan and watch intel, I wanted to run caldari missions to fund some light pvp
---
Anyways, you want to raise faction rather than corp standings initially.  IE I want to run missions in caldari space, so I want to raise caldari standings so I can run missions for anyone and everyone in caldari space.
---
So I ran the sisters of eve epic arc (really easy and plenty of guides on it), then followed the faction standing repair plan
---
https://forums.eveonline.com/t/faction-standing-repair-plan-aka-the-plan/8008
---
until my caldari was at 5 standing.  A little tedious but I can run level 4 missions for any caldari corp now which is big, because now you can find a constellation with several level 4 agents in it and run multiple missions at once
---
like this amarr constellation is ~10 jumps from amarr and has 6 agents - http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Devoid/Kisana#sec
---
and this one in lonetrek has 9 - http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Lonetrek/Asalola#sec
---
this is big because agents will typically give you missions only within their constellation, so you can pretty much set up shop and never have to leave unless you want to go roam somewhere.
---
also - https://forums.eveonline.com/t/level-4-missions-high-sec-guide-all-secrets-revealed-or-how-get-richy-rich-bored-and-quit/115697

how I learned about the lonetrek constellation but also the isk/hr missions to do.  You'll still have some filler missions, but you can roll with 5-7 of the missions he lists there and just never turn them in until they're about to expire
---
I have a stupid question. I have two characters that I just *might* in the future want to sell for isk or trade. I am not sure I want to either, but want to know the relative value range of the characters. I have posted a price check request on the official forums, but I suspect this will just lead to a bunch of low-ball offers by people who: 1. Think I am dumb; OR 2. Think I *need* billions of isk quick for some reason. 
---
If I posted links to them in this sub and asked for a price check, do you think I would get a more accurate response? True story.

And we love you for it.

Bots sure do love nyxes....

Disagree. CCP is a company providing paid service to thousands customers. They have people whose job is to run and support their services 24x7x365.25. There could be delays caused by natural disasters / mass bugs / etc. but 2 weeks should be more than enough to answer a pretty simple question.

made my first 5 bil exploring, next 100 doing industry out of low class wh, sometimes corp ratting in c3 or c5 sites.

I guess people are complaining about CCP support not responding to tickets about false-positive banhammers. 
---
Granted, anyone righteously banned will probably have sent a similar ticket but a possibility of a month-long radio silence is frustrating to say the least.

Especially given that OP lives in the totally democratic Republic of Russia and using a VPN was CCPs suggested method of playing EVE in case of \~~government happening\~~.

Don't forget about T5 abyssals with 3 frig-sized ships. Pretty good money for very little effort/risk. Best thing is you can do this anywhere!

Yeah, you were moving too fast!
---
Look for NPC corps that offer the 5 run BPCs for commonly used modules.  Republic Fleet comes to mind with the BPCs for RF warp disruptors.  You can make substantially more isk if you don't mind building those items from BPCs.  Run missions, gather LP, buy BPC, build items, sell for max profit.

I stole someone's storyline Amarrian Legionaries years ago. That guy went super salty about it. I still have those Legionaries in my high sec station.

They do lose money for it. But this is just GM not a corp leader. He doesn't care if he bans player or not. It was too lazy of him to even look at the evidence. He just decided its easier to ban player.

I'm running three clients + Mumble over a N300 USB3 WIFI adapter with no issues. Make sure your channels aren't saturated on the WiFi. Typically it defaults to 2 or 11 which are the highest saturated channels period. Most WiFi modems have the ability to scan channels and let you know the saturation, or you can get an app on your phone for free that will do the same. See which channels are free and move to a different channel. Just keep in mind if say channel 2 is saturated, you'll want to move to at least channel 4, always move up two or down two, you don't get enough separation just moving one.

Maybe, but isn't this just the extraction price? Both characters in question are high skill point, very very focused PvP combat pilots. One of them is one hell of a super cap pilot too. Then there are the implants in all of the clones--two sets of high grade slaves, 2 sets of crystals, 2 sets of +5s, etc. 
---
Epic...
---
My only problem with a t2 salvage-focused hull would be that it'd be pretty expensive. Even matching the price of a DST, you'd be looking at a pretty hefty cost for a dedicated salvage boat, and I'd be somewhat surprised if a t2 Noctis costed anything less, and most likely more. 
---
The question then becomes, what features would a t2 Noctis *have* that would make it worthwhile? "Noctis but better" isn't going to cut it.
---
If I were going to design a t2 Noctis, I'd start with an expanded cargo bay. Possibly add a small but modest fleet hangar, nothing massive, just a few thousand cubic meters, possibly even refit support capability if I was feeling especially spicy. 
---
If being cloaked didn't, as far as I'm aware, still allow you to siphon bounties if in fleet, I'd say that a covops cloak would be useful.
---
Alternatively, if they could get the code support to actually make it work, a hull-locked midslot module enabling the Maw, or whatever it was called, to automatically operate its tractor beams, or Maw-exclusive tractor beams with automatic target acquisition capability, would be pretty cool. At least then you'd have a hull that could actually beat out an MTU by tractoring faster and potentially with multiple concurrent beams.

Nah Fam (independent JF pilot here), your space mail is sacred.  You make good money doing Jita or Amarr runs for alliances.  Join an alliance and any amount of collateral they ask for will soon become peanuts to you.  Anything that would be near your price to steal and jump ship (everyone in the game besides Chriba has one) is just not worth it as the high pay contracts will stop no matter where you go.  
---

Doesn't an MTU already kind of do that? Brings all the wrecks into one place and loots them for you, and makes it super easy to salvage?
---
Venal blazing

I guess my question is if you want active money or passive money.  I have been trying to solve the low risk passive money problem for a while and I find that reactions and PI tend to work best to solve that problem... but then again, owning a JF or having a reliable logistics network is essential to selling goods and making it all work.

This is an interesting topic, as I see lowsec brawlers like BL and Snuff, and I see that they do dreadbombs, and even have titan deployments, and I wonder how they can do that stuff, you need sovnull to build titans, and how do they get their stream of minerals, or who do they buy the titans from. I do know that Evemogul has a public supercap construction Sotiyo in M-oee8, but I can only imagine what the system cost indexes are. Good post!

"Surprised you got this far in life talking like an obnoxious dribbler."

That you cant even explain why this would require a new ship over the existing ones I think we both know that your idea is fucking garbage.

IMHO this is an appropriate place to pitch this idea.

I always thought of a long range ORE salvaging frigate for newbros.

stupid long lock range and tractor beam range, fast with a salvage bonus, but very little survivability.

Move fast, stick on the outsides of fleet battles, and scoop up wrecks and stay alive.

It'd be fun as hell and profitable.

A couple of friends and I run abyssal frigate sites together. They are pretty fun, and also relatively easy once you know how to do them. The ISK/hr of running them is great, though you do have to actually be paying attention and flying your ship, which is a very different experience than a lot of people null ratting will be used to.

Change your gameplay often as you can. Krab one day, defend your space the next day, explore J-space, join BLOPS fleet, check your alliance agenda and filter what you want to do, discuss with people on TS/Mumble/Discord whatever. I made the mistake to be "ISK oriented" and it is how I got bored.

Well, one of my main mistakes was doing darks. I didn’t realize (until reading the helpful advice given on this thread) that darks aren’t good sites for a Gila.

That said, if I may ask, how do you fit your Gila for these? Do you do a passive tank?
---
Ok. Nice to know.

i am one of those, and yet, we are very rare i think

no tell me what do those packs contain? the galaxy pack, star pack and meteor pack?

yes

more sig = more damage incoming
---
A salvage fit catalyst has 4 tractor beams and 4 salvagers. And works rather well. So if you come up with a t2 salvage ship that is destroyer sized it would be a reworked eris effectively :-P 
---
Cheers. This is helpful. 
---
07 
---
The detail lies in Signature Bloom. When you activate an MWD, your signature radius, or essentially how big your ship "looks" to the enemy increases, which allows them to land more hits on you. When you activate an AB, there is no sig bloom, and therefore your ship doesn't "look" bigger. Using a 100mn allows you to travel at speeds where you transversal to the rats is high enough that the rats won't be able to track you consistently enough to kill you.
---
We should simply get tractor beam extenders as low slot modules and rigs. 
---
I am not sure, I was curious about this myself. All I know for sure is that *plex* purchases of Omega time *do not* count. 
---
Unless you're EVE famous or marketed to exactly the right person at exactly the right time, then it's unlikely those points will make much of a difference in price.
---
Most of the bidders will be looking to extract characters, so your base pricing will be based on (Total SP minus 5 mill) \* 800m ISK.
---
If you are looking to sell to someone interested specifically in the pilot, then I would add more expensive skillbooks (Titan, Capital ships, etc) to the price + the value of your implants, and that will give you a decent Buyout price to set.
---
It will not effect the average price of each skillpoint the market gives your character though.
---
All good except for ovops cloak, with that it would not get used for salvaging :-P 
---
maybe something like a bastion module that would lock ship in place but give serious bonuses to lock, tracktor beam and salvager radius? 
---
Was expecting a meme 
---
Was disappointed 
---
Join CODE.! Never a dull moment.

Nah, goons are usually pretty good with realizing that they're just girthing on some idiots in their supercapital umbrella for easy frags.
---
TAPI on the other hand, they'll drop a super on your under their own umbrella while you're in a nano-destroyer and then smug about how much *risk* they just took *dropping PL* etc.

I usually do around 1.5b per week in blue loot+salvage+relics. Gas+Pi+Data sites are some extras that I do not count as it is really small portion of the income.

This Plus
---
hull bonus to tractor speed / range / cap use.
---
hull bonus to savager success rate.
---
hull bonus to salvage quality.
---
mild defensive capability, similar to the porpoise.

can damage enemies with salvager's.
---
cost 250-300m as current prices.
---
Something shiny for the elite salvagers to risk, and a shiny target to pop for hunters.
---
So my Bro and I received an Escalation (?) last week while running Combat Anomalies in High Sec.  We googled it, and it was intense.  Too involved for a couple of noobs.  Apparently we could have sold it?  How does one go about this?
---
CCP advised me in a Reddit thread to use a VPN to test some things, crap like this is why I didn't.  This happens too much.
---
Understood, higher sig equals higher hit chance, and this outweighs the speed increase
---
having 250k tractor range conflicts with being maneuverable.  you can easily build a salvage interceptor to accomplish a similar goal.
---
how about a tier 3 interceptor, with a salvage module, that includes salvage/ module bay which can only be accessed while docked tethered.  
---
We have been completely evicted from 5 regions of space and god knows how many stations. PL chased us for 3 years... YEARS.
---
I think i'd like to see a moderate defense bonus as well, similar to a marauder.  like a comfortable 200dps tank with 20k buffer... to give your fleet a chance to defend it lmfao.

There's no EULA point abount not using a VPN. At least there wasn't one when I started playing a year ago.

Also the customer service is working fine. I had a login issue 2 days ago (new year!) and they resolved it within 30 minutes of writing to their support email.  
---
Your case may be simply not that transparent and pending a further investigation. No info on that is just rude though.
---
Why would having a 250km tractor range with having a strength bonus as well?
---
Make it snag wrecks from range (maybe limit it to cruiser/down) and suck to it super fast.
---
That feeling, when you see the "other accounts linked to this email feature"
---
The dread when you realize you've got to log into all 30 accounts to take advantage.

Can you fucking tard tell me what you see in the meteor pack so we can see where the difference is ?
---
You must've missed abyssal sites when they were first released and even just before the frigate/pvp room introduction. I waited a couple of months before trying t5 abyssals and I was netting upwards of 500mil an hour. I have 13 bil in two weeks just from running t5's for an hour or two a day. I haven't looked at their profitability nowadays, I just know it's less now.
---
And even if you weren't, anyone with a brain would use the "+string" method of making a 'distinct address', not make multiple emails. 
---
Yup! That is exactly it, the downside is that the mass addition for a 100mn AB is much higher than a 50mn MWD, which basically turns you into a brick and makes you turn super slow.
---
Maybe not while salvaging a site, but the Noctis amounts to a very fragile loot pinata and on many occasions I would have loved the ability to fit a covops cloak off a Mobile Depot when traveling between DED sites, around wormholes, or running from a neut.
---
True, but I think the failure of the 2012 campaign and the death of the HBC was effectively a really big downturn in it, enough so that people at the time were genuinely concerned it wouldn't come back. It only really became the same beast it once was after the HERO coalition formed IMO, but I know that's biased simply due to my own proximity to TEST at the time.
---
Yeah, the trade volume in tax havens outside of trade hubs are a serious cash cow. 
---
It saves broker fees for the listing agents and the tiny tax taken adds up very quickly. 
---
TEST wouldn't be kicking over every single trade citadel around Jita if it wasn't worth it. 
---
wow wow calm down cowboy, i m tired of trying to make you see, what all this has been about today.

Only good ideas get downvoted on this godforsaken circlejerk of a subreddit.
---
A single VNI isnt going to net you much of anything. VNI farming is good because it's AFK and scales well - you can have many specialized alts doing it at once.
---
You're better off running scannable combat sites with a strategic cruiser and hoping for escalations, that'll net you far better ISK. If you live in space that's lucky enough to have combat gas sites, that's even better ISK coming to ya - you can get lucky and get the neurotoxin skillbooks from those, they go for a lot in trade hubs.
---
I'm not sure, but 3 Nestors should be enough.
---
Btw there is a fun case - some chinese wormholer multiboxes a traveling circus of like 20 Nestors and runs C5-C6 sites while fliping off everyone he meets. The point of Nestors is their mass - they're as light as cruisers, so they easily fit through holes even when there's many of them in fleet.
---
Don't forget about refitting ability - Nestor fleets can switch resists to damage mods and back when needed.
---

Drag the bookmark into your inventory, make a contract for it with details about it 
---
that does seem to be the trend, not that anyone minds.  content is content, even if you die first. 
---
There are many different communities that purchase escalations - you would have to find one in your particular region. You could always ask in local.   
---
The process for actually selling the escalation - the person who receives the mission should warp to it. It will take you to a gate - just bookmark the gate and warp off.   
---
Once in the station you want to trade in, go to your "People and Places" menu and you can drag the bookmark into your inventory. Then contract it!   
---
Highsec: Missions, mining, indy, PI, combat and data/relic sigs

Lowsec: same as above, less on missions

Was the VPN a Free VPN? 
---
Most networks will ban IP addresses and ranges if they are attacked from them. 
---
Cheaper, shittier or free VPN's have a tendency to be blacklisted from many networks as they are the easiest for malicious actors to employ. 
---
If anything, the IP address your VPN used was probably already flagged by CCP from some actor at a different time.

---
Thanks for the tip, I've figured out how to classify the WHs with some sites.  
---
What mapping tool do you mean?
---
Yet again all of the good skins go for the same small selection of ships that already have 20 good skins.
---
unless you're gonna go back in time to a period of temporary scarcity of site drops, you're not even making half that.
---
No you're not, otherwise you would just have been "Oh so you see in the list a skin and some PLEX and I see X Y Z" and we could have seen the difference.
---
But you're acting retarded.
---
But you can get escalations for during normal anomalies in null... I myself got a 8/10 last night duing Hubs.
---
I did get this exact problem in the past and when a GM fixed it, he told to enable 2FA on your account. I did that and since then no have no problems with VPN use. I think I waited 1 week but the GM reimbursed the game time to my account.
---
I am mildly aroused, do you have any more to share?

I would agree with that. When we went to Faction Warfare I thought we were dead as well. It wasn't until Sappo pushed us into Hero that we started to pick up steam. Then the move to Wicked Creek pushed us a bit farther. We had Sappo on Talking in Stations last week and he went over the history as well if you wanted to listen to that. When people talk about TEST history I just like to remind them how down and out we really were. We were evicted so many times. Our staging stations were reinforced every few weeks. We were chased for years around the universe. It's a come back story of all come back stories if you ask me. Obvious bias is obvious though, lol.

In my corp, 75% of accounts online at any given time are generally me + one other dude in the corp, so that should say something about alts.

---
This is the point where i am better than you, i see what you cant see. you cant answer my question and yet still here trying to big your virtual dick about.

you must be a league of legends player, salty and only think about skins.....  i really couldnt give a fuck about skins. i leave it there as a little tip for you, maybe the coin will drop this time. if not oh well

---
That would be a disaster, someone would lose their hands.
---
Yes, you can. It will take forever but you can. It's faster/more efficient if you want to actively play the video game to go run scannable combat sites. Otherwise, yeah just AFK orbit a rock while doing chores or whatever, and pay CCP for the privilege to do so.
---
So I used to play all the time at work and the only way I could gain access was with a vpn on my laptop, never got banned,is this something new?
---
i am there
---
When I was playing (taking a break) my routing would sometimes be fucked up and I HAD to use a VPN to play. I know I've done it more than a handful of times.
---
With that said I never used a VPN to hide anything or do anything malicious or EULA breaking. So WTF CCP?
---
A few is generally defined as 3 to 7. If you put 7 hours in per week with a pair of tinker rattles and your astras killing drifters you're doing 5 sites in that 7 hours plus drifter kills. You're almost exclusively running strongholds/garrisons because lol farmhole. Your average isk per site is 250 mil, drifter loot is 300 mil. 5 sites + drifter =2.5 bil, not including salvage. That's exactly 10 bil a month for 7 hours a week.
---
You are objectively wrong.
---
fit still worked chieftain
---
Train for T2(relic analyser) get an astero... Go to Catch/Provi and do relic sites. WIN 
---
Okay so what is your suggestion that makes catching bots easier but not actual players?
---
There's plenty of isk to be made in wormholes. Just afk gas huffing then reacting what you huffed is really decent income. Combine that with pi, the odd combat site and PvP loot and you're great on isk.
---
Yeah well. Undock and you are in a pvp zone. congrats.
---
You're so far up your own ass it's hilarous.
---
BTW are you considering omega time as not being PLEX ?
---
Drove by a tagged up freight car the other day. Got to thinking about what that would look like in the future. 
---
As always, hit me up for any comissioned work you'd like (yes I take payment in ISK) whether its a cool hull, a dumb photoshop or alliance and corp logo design. 
---
Not sure I said about not catching players easier... if you want easy; there is alway's raven highsec in a raven.
---
call it "NOM". and make it eat the salvage!
---
SPUDumain?
---
Very cool! Thank you. Are there any spawns you haven’t been able to handle with that so far?
---
Well, сука блять pardner!
---
Is a real problem, look as the CCP mail sender server, dont send always lineally. Maybe you receive in some minutes or hours, but is not your fault. By the way, i assume high chance of you using [yourname.com](https://yourname.com) domain, not generic gmail /hotmail, etc, but the problem appear in both cases.
---
So you just want ganking to be easier. Why even bring bots up?
---
How does it fix it?
---
By not giving a fuck. It let's you shoot anyone, anywhere, any time.
---
In that sense, I actually agree... I prefer doing it with my Typhoon for better time/engagement!
---
The only player issue between PvE and PvP is that the PvE player is sad when they get PvPed.
---
This is a nice idea. 
---
Until CCP stops being worthless and fixes a core part of an MMO, there will and should be threads on this.
---
Last time I was unable to connect to Tranquility due to active DDoS countermeasures, in my petition that provided my logs (as per the CCP devblog request), they **specifically told me in the petition** to connect via VPN instead.
---
Inb4 banned for following CCP instructions, gg.
---
well, many people have not isk to pay for thet and sometimes you are in a hurry.  I was very active last two years in character bazaar and someties i prefer lost 10b and do the business. example, i purchase a 140m pilot in 130b some months ago, but later the prices drop and when i sell him at 130m loss many value because i need a 5m pilot better for my consolidation eeds My last "loss" was slling a 78m near perfect titan pilot with skinks, high slaves, titan ammrr V in 800m per 1millon isk. Some good usiness to, as lately sell a 4.7b pilot in 15b because was puller, trader, and have reputations with calday navy and emperor family, nice flip. Really if you wanta high price, must wait but sometimes is better just sell and simplifiy yourself. Or extract yourself, and sell the 5m pilot at more high price.
---
Yeah, you'd just have you posts deleted for bringing up any real issues over there.
---
Being able to refit itself I think would be better. Put 8 tractor beams on and pull everything in and then put 8 salvagers on and salvage everything.
---
&gt; after fixing current bugs
---
lol, good one
---
EVE = PVP 
---
theres no PVE only areas and no way to be 100% secure 
---
In a word, yes
---
Good slurpees make the world go round?
---
You brought up actual players.. completely off topic .. why bring it up?
---
I just said bots are everywhere; CCP should make it possible to catch them.. your response... but my ticks.
---
By Pve i mean mining or doing any task 
---
There are geographic zones of relative safety, but pvp can happen anywhere.  The cost/benefit math is just different in different areas.
---
There are three general zones:
---
High security space (hisec):  You can be attacked, but the "police" will kill the attacker (guarenteed).  Note that this does not mean you will not be killed before the police arrive, or that you will get your stuff back.  There is math behind this - if the attacker spends less on the ships he used to attack you than the price of the loot you drop, he comes out ahead economically.  Ergo, moving expensive stuff around in hisec is still a risk in spite of the police presence.
---
Low security space (lowsec):  No police, but attackers may take a reputation hit for initiating a fight.  Not regarded as a particularly big deal - low sec is famous for pirates and such.  Lone wolves and small groups of pirate-types like this area.
---
Null-sec:  no game-provided security or consequence of any sort for initiating combat.  Security, such as it is, is provided entirely by the residents of that space.  This is where the bulk of the game is happening.  Essentially all activity/content is player generated.  PvE and PvP are both happening here.
---
Note that as you get less secure, the PvE rewards get better - you'll make a lot more money mining in null-sec than you will in high-sec.  As a result, there tends to be a sheep-sheepdog-wolves kind of playstyle, in which there are corporations that host PvE zones that are periodically attacked by intruders, who are in turn engaged by the local corporation.  The PvE people are annoyed, but everyone else is having fun, mostly.
---
It's just how EVE is - if you are undocked, you are subject to being attacked.
---
CNN says that's healthy relationship behavior.
---
No need to bot when you're awarded a set of AT hulls annually
---
If CCP reimburses lost incursion battleships and excavators lost to npc rats I'm not surprised he's getting reimbursed for his dumb shit too.
---
We were all drunk and welcomed the escape from fambly, comms was pretty joyful on that op.  It makes it better that the "blueball" was after you already spent 80+ bill to get it to that state.
---
Hey!! Thanks i was hoping for a reply like yours. Now i get it, sounds very interesting. Maybe thats what made eve survive for 15 years
---
theres no safe areas , theres no 100% safe space 
---
the second you press "undock" you are in a pvp area
---
it doesnt matter how hard you try , sooner or later you will get PVPed 
---
Shouldn't the fact that you didn't even notice it tell you that the sky isn't falling? lol
---
CCP: ".. hmm... The number and dots associated with the person is different.. must be a bot... "
---
spam folder
---
Ha! This is full sick, I've been enjoying your stuff but this takes the cake. I may have you graffiti a ship for me sometime
---
The only true way. If you don't have multiple alts in Goons, you're doing it wrong.
---
Multiboxing wasn't really a commonplace thing until Capitals came in and everyone needed a personal cyno, as far as I'm aware anyway.
---
Some people had multiple accounts or bought new characters for industry to have alongside their pvp characters, but this was not nearly as prevalent that it is today.
---
That's why I think nullsec wars meant a little more back then than they do now. Null ratting varied heavily from region to region before anoms and afk ratting evened things out, so keeping good space was inviting a lot more trouble.
---
Now I think most people have an alt for lowsec pvp or pve for money while their main sits in null station spinning until the next strat op.
---
A brother to the Venture would make sense. Bonus to non-warp speed, tractor range and velocity (range bonus not as much as the Noctis, offset by the non-warp speed to zip around grid instead of sitting down at one spot), and salvager duration. The theory/metaphor would be the frigate is "single threaded" while the Noctis is "multi threaded" when it comes to salvaging.
---
Probably a 3/2/2 (tractor, salvager, cloak?/prop, cap/dcu, cargohold?) layout with dedicated salvage hold to discourage loot ninja-ing.
---
Though typing that out, I'm not sure what a new hull would benefit us from that a T1 explorer can't be reasonably re-bonused to have, or even already do. Maybe give them an extra role bonus to tractor beam velocity, but they already have the same salvager duration bonus as the Noctis and decent sized cargohold.
---
A stealth salvager might sound, but what's the point? If you're ninja/stealthing it how useful will a dedicated hull for it be? You could slap a cloak/salvager/tractor beam on a interceptor, CovOps, or T2 Venture hull and get the same survivability.
---
An active battlefield salvager might also sound cool, but is an FC really gonna trade an actual combat ship for it? And would either side really want a 3rd party to come in and steal the battlefield spoils of the victor?
---
The only other possible feature set I can think of that adds utility would be some kind of Orca/Noctis/Mobile depot hybrid. Big off grid command ship, allows for refitting in space, maybe remote reps between skirmishes, and Noctis tractor and salvager bonuses. But even then what do we get by rolling all those features into one hull? Store a Noctis in a FAX and you've got on-battlefield support. Stick a Mobile Depot in the Caroghold and you've got refitting.
---
Dm me any time my dude. 
---
Oh, I would totally love to fly 3 Nestors, but the price... It just bites so hard... You can fit 3+ Domis for the price of one Nestor. \~200M per Domi, you can fly 5 for a billion, it's 25 Heavy drones and can tank 2000+ damage, which is enough for the most of C5 sites. The rats are constantly switching between ships, so the neuting should not be an issue. And if it is you can always MJD one ship and you still have 20 drones grinding through those rats.
---
Unfortunately 3 accs is my maximum for now, and I'm still omw to T2 skills. Maybe in future if i can get some more pilots to fly by my side I will definitely give it a try.
---
are you serious lol
---
As a simple vindi pilot flying around webbing and shooting stuff, it hasn't mattered much as long as I pay some small attention to being where I'm supposed to during a wave and shoot my tags in order and look at broadcasts for seeing which site to go to next.
---
Poked Falcon on twitter, who knows, but hopefully something can be set up a permanent marker in his honour. 
---
When you undock you are in PVP zone.     
---
You don't even need to undock if you are in citadel.
---
Highsec is limited pvp, lowsec less restricted and null no restrictions if you’re talking about it simply. But everywhere in eve is a pvp zone in some form. 
---
Wait so for you PLEX and Omega time isn't the same thing ? And Omega time is what makes it a DLC ?
---
You don’t know corporate IT if you think that CCP wouldn’t just use IP blocking. 
---
All PVE tasks that require your ship to be in space put you at risk of PVP (except the few minutes a person takes to run solo abyssals, but I won't get into that).
---
In eve there's a chunk of space called high security space that "punishes" players for non-non-consensual pvp. Some folks are happy to be punished for attacking others. There are also a few other loopholes like war declarations and suspect timer mechanics that can allow free attack of people in hi sec without punishment. That may be what you've heard about the different geographic PVP areas.
---
If you haven't clued in already from other people's comments, understand that there's not really a "safe" PVP-free form of PVE. There are however plenty of precautions that can be taken to reduce the chances of a PVP encounter.
---
It’s not, there are more effective ways to fight bots. CCP would just have to actually put some work in. Or hell just buy an anti-cheat anti-bot software platform. 
---
&gt; mild defensive capability, similar to the porpoise.
---
I feel like if your salvager needs to be able to defend itself, you're doing it wrong.
---
You only salvage when you have territory control, either through force or intel.

Energized adaptive nano membrane, I'm guessing he messed up and meant to put EANM.

It's not even a lack of clarity tbh. 9.1 clearly states what categories of data section 9 refers to.
---
Can damage enemies with salvagers?
---
I mean thats a terribly dumb idea but it would be hilarious to see somebody like bjornbee doing battle salvager fleets
---
/u/ccp_falcon hire this guy for  skin designing 
---
Good. You won EVE, enjoy real life now!
---
Energized Adaptive Nano Membranes, an armor resistance mod. The A-type deadspace variants in (I believe) Blood Raider and Serpentis 6/10 DED sites typically sell for around a bil each, but they're RNG loot from the boss at the end of the site.
---
Not necessarily by itself. In this case it would be because CCP has other personal data to associate it with.
---
globby is 14 and expects the world to be handed to him, it's safe to ignore him.
---
Doesn't look like it applies to me. Article 9 is about profiling, and 22 is about automated decisions with a significant legal or equivalent impact - hard to argue that being banned from a video game would count for that. (I guess that's targeted at automated credit analysis and similar things.)
---
GDPR means that CCP has to be careful with how it handles your data, and it can't easily outsource CS to India, but it shouldn't have any effect on direct interactions between you and CCP or on banning decisions.
---
Re your edit, fair play to you for gracefully accepting correction.
---
Why not just start by making the noctis not shit.
---
This makes me want to make a second reddit account just to upvote you twice.
---
Sounds like you are talking about urself too much.
---
With the amount of money we spend on the game, I would like to see CCP support get it together, do better. I personally have never had an issue with support, but with the amount of people I know that have, it's pretty disheartening.
---
I'd love to see the market graph for that.

---
Salvaging yellow wrecks doesn't trigger suspect status.  Looting does, but not salvaging.
---
&gt;You only salvage when you have territory control, either through force or intel.
---
Spoken like a true coward
---
&gt;Yup! That is exactly it, the downside is that the mass addition for a 100mn AB is much higher than a 50mn MWD, which basically turns you into a brick and makes you turn super slow.
---
On a VNI, this means you basically won't ever enter warp until you turn off the AB.
---
Or u/ccp_falcon advocate the ability for people to create skins.  Have someone look over the skin to make sure it meets community Guidelines and then give someone the blueprint to create the Skin.  the blue print could be for x number of creations.  
---
Transversal man, transversal.
---
Smart reasonable answer. Also strats in highsec doing that are like 100 times better than vni ratting on average.
---
Your question is a word-for-word copy of /u/zacanawa's post in last week's thread.

He wants to make isk and your suggestion is to mine ice in highsec. Christ I understand why everyone says provi is fucking retarded now.

It could be necessary for the performance of the contract (Article 22(2)(a)). There could be thousands of cases where VPNs are used in this way. Should someone have to manually look at that? Probably not.

Selling escalations requires the buyer to trust that you:
---
* have an escalation
---
* are providing the correct bookmark
---
* the escalation hasn't expired
---
* you won't try to sell it to multiple people
---
Probably pretty accurate as well.
---
Can you do a Worm?
---
Excellent description, just to add; wormholes are pike nullsec security wise, and the removal of local
---
Why is it CCP's responsibility to ensure you can connect to eve from networks that dont allow it?
---
Doesn't outweigh it, it cancels it out. 100% speed with MWD on is the same, tracking wise, as going 100% with MWD off. (aside from bombs, and ignoring the fact you're out of optimal (pvp) in seconds most likely).
---
That is, mostly. In certain situations you still sigtank better with MWD 
---
 than without it. IE: with links, on bonussed ships (interceptors, assault cruisers etc), MWD's that have a smaller sig increase (quad lif/faction/deadspace/abyssal), heated MWD, coasting after the MWD is turned off, and I'm prolly forgetting one or two more.
---
All that is basically meaningless in a PVE setting since an AB is just far better. But in a PVP setting knowing and properly using MWD's so you sigtank more can squeeze a quite bit of extra performance out of your ship and win you the fight.
---

This is not a simple issue. At some point, VPNs will probably be banned because of how much they are abused by botters.

Are the people who make up the art team just incredibly talented? Or are they well staffed? If they're trimming the workforce at CCP, wouldn't the art team probably be the first to get pared down?

All hull image commissions start at 3 billion ISK which purchases a wallpaper of a ship of your choice. 
---
I will include any hull skin, racial logo, corp/alliance logo or basically anything you want on it *within reason* at no additional cost. 
---
**Note: Graffiti skins increase the price because they're custom and require a lot of time to build. Talk with me about what you want on it so that I can get an idea of pricing.** 
---
I require half of the payment before beginning the project and the other half upon completion. Before the project is finalized, I'll make a watermarked image for you to see in case any changes are needed. Upon receipt of the 2nd half of the payment I'll send you the un-watermarked final image.

Pricing for a wallpaper is dependent on hull size and intricacy of design. Why is it based on hull size? Because titans take four times longer to make and battle scenes are especially involved and often require me to put other commissions on hold in order to have time to complete. 
---
* **Any single ship that's not a Titan: 3 billion**
---
* **Single Titan: 5 billion.** Titans have a remarkably complex design and a lot of surface area. This creates a lot of technical hurdles and requires significantly more time. 
---
* **Battle scenes and/or multiple ships: 8+ billion ISK**. Please discuss the specifics of this project with me prior to sending any ISK. 
---
If you like what you see and you'd like to comission a piece, please send me the following in a *single* message:
---
1. Send me a link to eve-who ( https://evewho.com/ ) of the corp/alliance you'd like the logo of (if you're interested in incorporating one).
---
1. Let me know what ship you'd like, any particular angle or specific requirements you have for it, and let me know if you want the ship in the standard color scheme, an in-game skin or different color scheme. (if it's an in-game skin please send a link to it)
---
1. Let me know if the "standard" color gradient background is fine (as seen in some of reddit image posts) or if you want something more elaborate. Please note that technically elaborate backgrounds may result in an increase of total price but we can discuss that prior to.
---
Please note that I am often working multiple projects simultaneously in addition to work and life. I will let you know the time-table during our discussion of the piece. 
---
I look forward to starting a great project for you. 
---
I live like 45min away but I won't be able to make it this weekend :(
---
Nah it's blacklisted IP's. I've logged into friends accounts from far away with no issues.
---
Implying that CCP even has a balance team
---
&gt; you're doing 5 sites in that 7 hours plus drifter kills
---
That's actually really bad site times too. You can get it way down.
---
Tax them at a higher rate or in general say 100%  it would take money out of the game.
---
The materials to make them could be hard to find and expensive so that they cost tons.  Say a billion isk  per skin.  Then half a billion disappears from the game with every purchase.  More people would be buying plex to buy tons of skins.  Skins sold like this would also be a one-shot deal.  Use it once, and it's gone.  
---
I snickered while doing it. 
---
He he
---
Schneckt &lt;3
---
Talk about projecting.
---
FYI "CCP should stop making skins and focus on balance" can also mean a diversion of money from art team to whoever doing fix/balance.
---
That...that is not how ccp makes money from Eve.
---
Amarr ships are probably the worst for a low SP player. Your guns and reps use a lot of capacitor, and managing that can be a little more challenging than using say, a Vexor. Drones don't use any ammunition at all.
---
While you're not wrong, sinking isk from the game is something they could use some help on.
---
I am taking up with a Wormhole group for the first time in my Eve career. They seem like nice guys and willing to teach me the basics, but help me not look like a total idiot. Is there anything I should know when first getting into J-Space? What kind of ship(s) should I bring out to make sure I have something to do while training into their doctrine? 
---
I find it highly unlikely that many people that do not play eve would be subscribed to a subreddit that is completely about that topic. For example, I'm not into knitting, therefore I don't subscribe to that sub. So yes, it's logical to use that number as a guide. 
---
I don't see how you playing the game would "burst my bubble". I assume most people here play the game. If you took my comment personally, perhaps you should reflect on that.
---
My corp and its 30 alts are all me so obviously we have an alt issue.
---
So they get more caps on grid for a 12 man Red vs. Blue gang than for this. The more you know(tm)
---
We're 12 y/o
---
The answer he is looking for is that he should pick Gallente and fly a Vexor because that will give the most bang for your buck for low sp ratting.
---
If they wanted to do that then ccp could increase taxes for all transactions.  It would be easier and cheaper than to design and then half ass inpliment another new feature that six people will use.
---
It's simple, just charge people similar amounts of plex for a "customizable" skin blank. Just sell them right next to regular skins. In the online store. Done. Easy. They make more money, players have customizable skins.
---
It's easier to just call them "Goons". Fewer syllables.
---
I will never buy skins from ccp.  
---
Ever.  
---
CCP could use Warframe’s model. They have community skins that cost a bit extra compared to the dev designs. When a skin is sold from the store a percentage of the profit goes to the Indy creator. At this point the coolest skins are player created. DE could stop making skins and there would still be awesome new skins every month that people want to buy. Would be a great addition to EVE and to get player base (creators and buyers) one more meta layer invested into the game they love.
---
Go out to a high sec ice belt sometime and just marvel at the degree to which some dude fleets up 20 covetors with an orca and a obelisk.  
---
Saw a dude The Forge space orbiting a machareal at 10k of the belt along with his fleet of icers 
---
no, because skins sell plex, and bug fixing isnt sexy, doesnt directly generate a profit, is hard, and costs a lot more
---
I am perfectly aware both sides are more than capable of fielding a whole helluva lot more than either fielded here. But neither did, we all had fun, and will see 'em again at the hull timer. The more YOU know(TM).
---
L5s can easily get you &gt;1b per hour if you aren't disturbed and know what you are doing...
---
Sorry to intrude your post, but I am looking for a corp who does VNI Drone Ratting as I want to get into it. 
---
Have however no desire of joining in active PvP (for now). Anyone who would care to take me? Would join on a newbean account but I have some experience in eve :)
---
Make Uedama Great Again?
---
Hello Guys, I am a relative new player (27m sp), spend my time in this game playing in null, doing alliance stuff a lot, some ratting and exploration, etc, but now I wonna expand a little my game experience. I would really like to do some Unrated and rated combat sites in my new trained Tengu (new bro with this ship). So, what I wanna know is, what sites can I run with this ship? I have no experiencie or idea at all about this sites, all the PVE that I did was ratting anomalies in VNI or rattlesnake. Can I run any Unrated that I could can down? And how about Rated? I mean, I really wanna fly this beautiful ship and make some PVE or even PVP (hunting explorers or miners in WH), I wanna do something different than ratting and ratting and ratting. 
---
I love the idea of traveling safe with covert and no worries about bubbles, scanning sites in null or even wh (dangerous to do in solo, so I preffer nullsec), and running sites.. I trained HML and RLML, I got decent-good all around missiles skills (explosion, velocity, flytime, etc), still didn´t train HAM (next short time goal). So, I can fly a Tengu with subsystems at lvl4, I can afford to loose a 500M-1B fit, have HML or RLML ( I know the difference, so I think you would say that I us HML and traing HAM) and that´s all i think. I am aware about different kinds of damages and how to tank them, etc.   
---
So, thank you! in advance! Please tell me what kind of PVE content I can do with this Tenguuu!
---
yeah ive always understood it as a jab at management for their hiring/firing priorities, not that ppl expect the art staff to fix bugs
---
&gt; any comissioned work you'd like (yes I take payment in ISK)
---
RMT REEEEEEEEE /s
---
Yes, please!
---
Same bud
---
Looks like this will be the clear winner. But where should I go? Faction war? Null? Low sec? 
---
I do once remember there being something about connections from IP addresses located further apart than one could have travelled in the intervening time.  The ban was automatic to protect the account from being hacked.
---
That was long ago (years), so I thought they'd have addressed that by now.
---
My remark was posted without comment on the validity or potential popularity of the specific idea.
---
can I get a TLDR
---
I like the skins, never paid full price tho
---
ive also found my exotic dancers and spiced wine seem to combine while in tow out here, "where that damn spiced wine crate go" \*looks at stumbling exotic dancers
---
I can multibox up to seven. For fun stuff (pvp) I typically play two, maybe three at a time, and usually one of them is cloaky eyes somewhere or an inty scout with the occasional third being a dictor. For boring stuff like ratting or mining I use more.
---
Most of the time I hate having them and wish I could bring myself to go back to two, or even just one. Usually the fun stuff happens when someone else is filling out my fleet instead of just me.
---
Go join Horde, they'll take you. They take anyone. Plus they're a fun group.
---
strats in highsec?
---
Stratioses? Doing what in highsec?
---
Except it doesn't. Russians are reportedly also getting banned for VPN
---
This is what happens when you leave your ship unattended while docked in Jita 4-4.
---
&gt;I believe the mechanic is there to prevent people who have previously been permabanned from creating new accounts.
---
i knew gigx was somehow to blame xD
---
I have done Sansha 10/10s in my Tengu. Rattlesnake is far superior/faster.
---
Exactly!  The "art team should fix the bugs" fallacy is common in other games, but almost everyone I've seen bringing it up with regard to Eve has been criticizing the management and long term priorities more than any individual worker.
---
/rant on
---
I didn't think it was; however, it just makes me sad because I, at one point in the late oughts, believed honestly that CCP had its finger on the pulse of the future of gaming, and that EVE was something special. I abandoned these thoughts years ago; however, I still had a soft spot for them and was optimistic about their long term success and impact on the industry. 
---
Keep in mind I am saying this as someone who used to work in the industry and develop for a major MMO.
---
My opinion of most (all) major Korean MMOs and the companies that run them is not very good, and while I think they worked out the 'future' of MMOs business wise with micro-transactions, I do not consider any of their games--including Black Desert and its vaunted character creation system--very innovative.  
---
So it saddens me that, theoretically, a Korean MMO company can force CCP to make design decisions and can control the direction of CCPs future development projects. 
---
It also makes, like it or not, every move that can be remotely read as pushing Eve towards a micro-transaction model seem suspect, regardless of whether or not that fear is fair. 
---
/rant off
---
would work. Also something I would like for mtu is the ability to tell it to prioritize based on wrecks having loot, not just distance. 
---
pleas hands of the thrasher, thx
---
never stop a runing system btw
---
^ agreed.
---
don't get me wrong, Imperium is a interesting name, and CFC is.....less said the better for public name.
---
but goons just means more and represents their history better
---
&gt; [...] then you've got ample warning to dock up.
---
And that's part of what makes Rorqs so powerful - hostiles roaming about are no reason to dock up (or even desiege) if you're confident in your Umbrella's ability to form up and go stomp them within the five to seven minutes of absolute invulnerability Panic gives you.
---
&gt; Eh, clumping up isn't exactly needed for using them.
---
Clumping up makes you effectively immune to smaller gangs - if you do not have the logi and buffer to take &gt;10k dps to the face you may as well leave the anom with a dozen Rorqs in it alone.
---
You'll be hard pressed to find groups that don't do at least a bit of null given the desolate state of FW. Best bet is probably the min-amarr warzone, Ushra Khan and such.
---
nom nom all ur wrecks
---
Yeah there's an abstract at the top
---
&gt; onsolidation 
---
Yes, clearly the 'real' prices of characters has fallen because of skill extractors and injectors. 
---
Now that, if you are rich enough, you can just inject a new character to do whatever you want, the value of someone else having paid for and managed a characters training for years is far less than it once was. 
---
Good one

is this paper a joke or what
---
Fuck is bad word and mittens wants more $$$ &amp; more marketting/family friendly coalition so he imperium now
---
Until you reach a certain tipping point where the game is so buggy and core features are so unreliable that people start bailing.  And the danger is, by that point it may be too late to even start because of the amount of broken code that got built on top of the existing problems which all needs to be worked through.
---
Code maintenance and bug fixing isn't sexy and doesn't generate profit, but it keeps the profit from degrading or crashing.  Unfortunately in most cases upper management and stockholders strongly favor short-term gains which can set companies up for long-term losses.
---
Hey,
---
I took a look at your case and while I can't go into detail about why exactly your accounts were banned, I want to clarify some of the assumptions made in the story. Your accounts were not suspended due to VPN use or a "blacklisted" IP address, nor were they banned by an automated process. This doesn't look like a false positive due to VPN use.
---
Whether the ban was warranted, I cannot say. There is however more to this than just VPN use.
---
I do see your ticket open in our system and once they've gone over your case, our security team will get back to you as soon as possible regarding your appeal.
---
If your solo maybe FW space? I’ve never done lowsec myself. Horde is another option if you want to fight a blob. 
---
Yes big dig = big target. 
---
Venture for gas mining &amp; exploration frig for hacking pirate relic/data sites. I like the Astero for exploration but I would recommend starting out with the cheap T1's until you have a good handle on navigating wormhole space.
---
That's okay.  I apologize if I seemed harsh.
---

He said “good”
---
Companies that are constantly firing and re-hiring artists based on how many bugs are currently active are shitty companies that won't be hiring anyone pretty soon.
---
&gt; Most of the bidders will be looking to extract characters, so your base pricing will be based on (Total SP minus 5 mill) * 800m ISK.
---
I was more 'eve famous' in 2008 than I am now, and then only as a vocal advocate for non-consensual pvp on forums than anything else, but I was known well enough back then. Now? I doubt anyone recognizes me. 
---
That said, I totally get the whole extraction market, particularly with "jack of all trades" characters who have skill points spread around all over the place. 
---
Both of the characters I *might* think about selling though had very finely controlled combat training. No skill points are wasted, and I have (on both characters) most of those long cap *and* sub-cap skills that people usually train to 4, but don't want to invest 20 to 50 days to get to 5, at 5. 
---
So really, depending on the type of combat pilot someone might be looking for, these characters are *exactly* what people spend hundreds of billions on skill injectors to 'perfect' from the ground up. 
---

---
Do you have a bil isk?
---
Good find.  I look forward to reading it on my commute home tonight.
---
What does this have to do with local chat?
---
i don't think anyone expects the art team to fix bugs. but when the game is broken to shit and back for months in a row and all they do is chug out skin after skin i can't help but feel that their priorities are a bit off. so yea, post all the dumb memes you want, doesn't change the fact the game's busted and spamming cosmetics should be the last of their worries if they gave 2 shits about their base.
---
Theres also wh’s but noone goes there, null sec with random spawning gates and improved income is probably the best way to look at it.  
---
Cyno and tank fitted in delve (probably also need to be in goons)
---
Dreads in bigger fights have lost all their edge with so many supers and titans, they just don't hold up. They're still good in the less mega blob fights. Moros itself isnt great either because its really only got a high damage, but with cap neuts a thing now it usually gets shut down hard, and typically dies first no matter what because its a weak tank. Limited range if it bumps as well. The other dreads are just more better in more sitations. Moros is really only good if you just need a gank dread to do a ton of damage where you dont think you're gonna get dropped on by anything.
---
Not a super impressive video, just some of the better fights (in my opinion) myself and the good folks of Spoopy Newbies got in December. Hopefully 2019 will bring even better fights and even sicker killmails. 7o 
---
It is, but it's easier to farm karma while mocking your opponents with an MS Paint-tier comic edit than to acknowledge their points and engage in serious debate.
---
Yeah, figured other people might be interested in seeing what a more academic take on it looks like, I know I was.
---
You mean purple?

Which is stupid given that CCP officially allowed and encouraged it.

What about Ishtar? It has 50% penalty reduction for mwd's sig bloom. Does extra speed+sig bloom reduction make it up?
---
I'm pretty sure that they don't neet to be notified of varying IPs, the VPN has another noticable factor I guess. I live in Germany and like most of the country I have a non-static IP, which means that I will get a new one at least every 24 hours. 
---
My Internet connection resets every morning at 6:30 am and I will get a new IP then and I also get a new IP after every power outage or after I pulled the plug on my router or simply told it to reconnect.
---
I never notified CCP of this, but I'm pretty sure they are aware and that simply having a new IP adress frequently can't get you banned.
---
Or tractor beams that salvage after full cycle
---
I'm kinda against any mtu buff tbh, it's already pretty powerful to the point it nearly obsoletes the noctis. it really doesn't need to step on any more of the noctis' toes.
---
Nice, what amount of dps do you need to tank? Do you use MJD in the last room?
---
African Atomic. 
---
Balance doesnt make Hilmar's wallet fatter
---
Now you're talking - exclusive T2 salvager &amp; tractor beam module, role bonus for the Maw so that only it can fit it. It starts salvaging whilst tractoring too, so you can really go wild.
---
Props to your corp, seem to be very active
---
Sorry, universe ran out of canvas. But for $1 we can hook you up with this red dot.
---
not as simple as it sounds.  there are times when demand for the art team is 120%.
---
quick major shifts in labor hours is not an easy task when using skilled labor unless using contractors - which often comes at efficiency cost.  even harder for jobs based in iceland with its smaller talent pool.  
---
if there was any ship worth getting bonuses to T2 salvage rate/quantity it should already be a noctis.  
---
Dont need a T2 version. Just bonus it.
---
Myself not rich (400b in total, including pilots) but prefer sometimes loss to consolidate. Agree, skill injectors are bad for eve,
---
I'd argue it does to an extent, it's just harder for them to prove that to the people who actually get to make the decisions
---
Balance means the game is more fun for more people (getting to play a variety of playstyles, not getting dumpstered 24/7 unless they fly x ships) means that people are likely to stay subbed for longer
---
But they can't really chestbeat about high sub numbers if they can't get anyone to sub because it's broken as shit
---
Well, that's kind of response that support team should be able to deliver in less than 2 weeks and not using reddit. That was the whole point starting this thread.
---
Please do something with support responses to those bans (false positive or well deserved).
---
Thanks.
---
:thinking:
---
Copy that. Autocowrekt is primary. 
---
Can I do some Abyss sites in a VNI? Also, how do you you get into Abyss sites? 
---
I  have the same problem.
---
Maybe you can win eve too? :( Shit man that sucks. Hope they fix it.
---
Hey dude, just FYI—70% of nullsec is now allied with Goons. So you won't get very far on reddit with negative Goon opinion. 
---
The old Provi dudes, TEST, TIKLE, BRAVE are all goon allies now.
---
Herp deep. 
---
Nice. Good to know enough upvotes on r/eve get your case reviewed.
---
Oh my god, this made me moist
---
Herp derp. 
---
Ever think that they have all those pesky legal issues to dance through and just maybe limited amounts of manpower to deal with all the tickets the honest players and the crybaby players generate?  Or are you one of the people that just love to post salt on the reddit forums of all places to try and get sympathy points for your case?
---
when they make it so moons could get poped?
---
Queef...
---
Of course, but it's not a line item on a budget like a skin sale is so a manager isn't gonna consider it at all.
---
That was actually in the hangar where there's supposed to only be one ship
---
I have one more stupid question, what is the current best trade third party app for analytics and profit tracking? I used to use Eve Trade Master, but it does not seem to exist anymore. I am looking for something that will work with my API and I can thus import my orders and market information. Plus if it can give me alerts when someone has out/under bid me. 
---
And i think your underestimating how many people would skins like this.
---
2 fleets moved to Aridia shooting Citadels. :)\_
---
holy crap, well you cant change omega time for isk. holy shit dude
---
I don't claim it is simple. It's just what people asking might be a more rational request than how the caricature depicts it.
---
I still prefer "those bee guys".
---
dimensions? how durable?  what printer did you use.
---
o.o
---
o7  He will be missed.
---
That is amazing I love it. 
---
I have mixed feelings about them. I am open to them existing, but *completely* capping off at somewhere between 15 and 20 million total SPs.
---
And this only because, over the years, I have talked to many people who tried eve but gave up because they felt like "they could never catch up to older players." I figure at 15 million SPs in something you can do 'alright' at that with those SPs to alleviate that feeling of  being overwhelmed by older players. 
---
That said, I see no fucking reason at all--pardon the language--to allow super rich people, either in real life or the game, to just skill inject themselves to whatever total SPs they want. 
---
If nothing else, it *completely* cheapens the decade of training I put into my characters.  I mean, I suppose I could just blow through all my assets and isk and 'do it too,' but you know what? The majority of people who will ever play this game cannot afford to, so I won't either. 
---
And in a round about way it is.
---
They sell plex.  
---
People sell plex in game for isk.
---
People use to buy the wildly overpriced skins, so their ship looks genuinely unique.
---
Or instead of taxing it require the skin to have a special paint that's purchasable from a vendor at every station.  That costs like a billion credits. Then the skin cost on game even if the creator using it will take something like a billion isk out of circulation.   
---
As someone else said, they could also sell a single-use item that added a custom user skin slot to a ship.  
---
It's 8 inches / 20.5 cm long and durable enough for me to fly it around my desk making spaceship noises. If I were to ship it, I'd worry about the little wingy bit. I use a Tevo Tornado.

---
Well, at least now I know I'm not the only one :D Do you live in Germany by any chance? I tried out a VPN and with VPN on it worked for me, so I'm not sure if it's an issue with CCP or if it might be my IP-provider
---
I love how there's one in stock yet 34 reviews.
---
Am I going to have to explain once again why removing local won't solve botting?
---
The irony is it's never been easier to hire freelance developers to help with technical debt... And I know POS code and 'it's hurd' but their existing device team are doing a white job with regressions already so just pay the bloody Piper and hire some dudes!
---
Now THIS is shitposting.
---
No it dosen't, tell me where the isk gets deleted from the game. You pay somebody else for ships, they have the isk, it dosen't get deleted from their wallets when they die.
---
It produces isk because insurance creates isk out of nothing.
---
You should be able to do T1s and T2s easily, and T3s might be challenging (no personal experience tho). You enter them by using items called 'filaments' - they are like keys and each type of filament gets you into a different type of abyssal site. Either buy them on the market or acquire them by doing relic and data sites (exploration). 
---
Yes. Be in space not theatherd or near any objects. Right click on the filament and it's says like jump or activate. Start with calms.
---
&gt;"Firstly, we compare the activities of the leaders of the Imperium with those of a medieval dynastic group..."

---
seeing all those lsh super pilots panic picking up their ships from their poses makes this smug post kinda look stupid.
---
One of the golden rules of Eve is that you "lose" a ship the second you undock. Meaning, it will probably get killed at some point. Be prepared to lose it.

DST?  heh.  i was thinking more like command ship prices. if scaled up from t1 mineral cost.

^ This is exactly what 90% of eve is at. the other 10% does it in super. Thanks CCP
---
Yeah sure
---
Needs more Dickbutt 
---
it kinda depends on what they do - do you need to bring your own roller? your own prober? are you gonna pve? are you gonna nanoroam? are you gonna wh brawl at 0 on wh's?
---
my wormhole hangar is way different from a dude who lives in a c5-c5 who wants to mostly do wh brawls because we roam out of our null static
---
I was sure this was going to be a joke, but no it's just literally the academic paper you describe.
---
How would it? Bots might not be able to detect incoming enemies as well, but they also won’t be as easily discoverable. 
---
give it a go
---
then after you say "they'll just use gate camp bots" and someone says "lul wormholes" and you say "well dscan bots then" and they say "so literally any other ship in space within 14AU causes bots to dock up then?" will you move the goalposts again, or will you admit you're wrong?

Ok, thank you.

The dynamic IP will always be from the same provider and geolocate to the same country. VPN could be anything.

I feel like they should be renamed to Honey Bears
---
Why would they not allow it?
---
its a ccp problem. i live in tunisia and no problem with my provider everything else working fine. i dont wanna use vpn so ill just wait ccp to fix it :)
---
I use VPN always. Constantly. It randomizes it's location all over the world when I set it to do so as well. Never had an issue.

Somewhere in Jita somebody is trying to replicate this scam.

skins are easy to make and people buy them.  Easy for the art team to work on some skins in between the bigger projects like new ships, structures, effects, and whatnot.

1.  Train Connections 3.    
---
2.  Do a single level 1 mission.    Use any frigate or destroyer.
---
3.  Do level 2 missions until you have standing for level 3.  Nearly all can be completed in a destroyer.  **Mission of Mercy** requires a cruiser (or something more robust than a T1 frigate / destroyer).    
---
4.  Do level 3 missions until you have standing for level 4.    
---
5.  Never do level 5 missions.

Dscan bots to deal with wormholes are a bad idea. But there are better ones. Here, I had this exact discussion with somebody on the forums.

id try some of the lvl 1/2s in a vexor first. No need to lose a VNI because you dont know the rats yet

well i have also been killing them and reporting them at the same time. who knows, i have put in a support ticked for EULA clarification but have not heard anything back yet
---
That's not what I was suggesting. Drop by black rise and you will understand what I mean
---
No i just go and slowboat toward the bastion thing and kill it ASAP. Then pick up loot and GTFO
---
This plus depending on where you are hunting (assuming NS) you could also get drops for more torps to use. (t1 but damage is damage) 
---
 Nope
---
sending bots back to their home permanently because I killed their bot rolling carrier for free sounds sorta fine in exchange for being able to catch humans too 
---
they're still botting but now they have much more risk to do the math on because a game about a dark scary world doesn't have a perfect free intel tool anymore 
---
What's the pay for out on 1/2s?
---
Hey there guys! I've been away from the game for around 7 years now, about the time Aurum made it into the game. I started grad school and found I didn't have the time to keep playing consistently. Around the same time, my ratting buddy ended up quitting for personal reasons. 
---
I don't have anywhere to join back in that feels like a decent fit, and things have changed so much that the little I knew when I first started feels like nothing now. I'd like to try and step back into my old pilot to find some fun, but I don't know where to begin. Any thoughts or advice? 
---
Much appreciated 
---
Do you have a fit for less than 40 minutes per site for 2 snakes? I just set up my farm hole this week and both my alts have pretty close to perfect drone skills, don't really know what else to do to decrease time per site other than change the fit
---
Okay, although it's a bother at least it's not on my end then :D

Most groups will tell you to come in a covops or Stratios at first, then worry about getting their doctrines later.  
---
not much tbh 10mil maybe? , you can get some Trig BPCs tho. But for high end lvl4/5s you need a very expensive ship (like a bling fit gila - 5bil isk).
---
Ive found Lvl 1/2 you can run in a vexor, Lvl 3 starts to get hard in a vexor.
---
I think it's always a risk, even using paid VPNs, that there will be people who abused the network. You could always set up your own VPN by purchasing a simple VPS with a dedicated IP address that only you would have access to for the same monthly cost of a paid VPN service.
---
You would set up a Linux box of some sort with openvpn cli or OpenVPN Access server(newbie friendly web graphical config managment). Obviously, you couldn't pirate but it would provide openvpn and security. 
---
  Goons will be studied centuries from now as the first online "army"

CCPLZ! Urban Industrial SKINS!

Or an expansion of the existing dirt mechanic; when you leave a ship at a station for too long it becomes dirty. Instead of getting dirtier and dirtier, cheeky dockworkers would start bombing your ships with random grafiti, starting small, until the ship is completely tagged up.

But its not CCP's fault you encounter those limitations. IP banning of VPNs is a quite effective way to deal with botters.
---
Your mobile shared IP is probably not going to be assigned to a hosting or VPN provider.
---
Nobody goes there? Your own alliance has a wormhole group.
---
Me, too, honestly. It'd need to be one hell of a salvage machine to do that, though, which tells me it needs some sort of tertiary usefulness beyond pure salvage as a focus.
---
You know, if they implemented the salvage probes I was talking about elsewhere, that'd be a good reason to use a "Maw." That is, a hull-locked special variant of scan probe launcher and accompanying probes capable of scanning down wrecks.
---
Even in low class wormholes your isk per hour using things like t3ds isn't bad and you pay for your ship quickly. High class sites if you can find a buddy to run c5 sites with in duo rattles can be absolutely obscene in terms of isk per hour vs relative risk and required skills.
---
It won't be permanent. They'll minimize the risk as much as possible, but at the end of the day they'll happily take losses to keep the ISK flowing.
---
The TLDR here is that the bot makers will always find ways to work around whatever game mechanics are put in place. Developers are good at finding solutions to logic puzzles, which is precisely what this is. I'm a developer, and even tho I've never worked on bots I can think of several ways to make botting work without local. It'll be a more complex solution, no doubt, but it'll work nonetheless.
---
The solution to botting isn't trying to screw up the game to get in their way. It's making better detection and removal processes. From all appearances CCP simply hasn't put enough effort into that. (I'm guessing the higher-ups don't feel like it's a priority to find efficient ways to ban paying customers, even tho those customers are ruining the game.)
---
Its free
---
The point is that people act like its something CCP don't already DO.  Like do you really think they have 200 artists just sitting around because nobody in management has looked at the staffing levels recently?
---
not really
---
Seems like I'm better off running my regular rat sites. What's the motivation for running lower level Abyss sites if you can't run the high ones? The BPCs? 
---
Typically yes, in my experience. Plus you have T2 resists (this might not help depending on local rats).
---
You want something that would make it usable and in demand? Just give it's salvagers a chance based on t1/t2 and skill level in the hull to upgrade the salvage from t1 to t2. Call it 2 % per hull level.
---
Yes, but as a business I 100% guarantee you they already do this.  You think they don't trim the fat from their teams when required?  If anything they do this TOO much (RIP Community Team).
---
Somthing different, you may get lucky and get a bigger haul. I'd say Try them out. They are more involved/harder than a normal ratting site. 
---
Its the first one.  The art team is maybe a couple dozen people.  R&amp;D/Development already FAR outnumber them.
---
ITT Also : people who think you can just hire more coders to work on a finite sized code base and bugs will be fixed faster.

---
Sperg-wise, WTM comms is *infinitely* superior to Horde standing comms, dude. Although if I have to hear the newbro speech one more time I may drink bleach. 
---
I'd imagine that the other large alliances are just as bad as Horde's, comms-wise, at least on their party lines.
---
They are just all cloaky on grid!
---
See the thing is - You can't just "hire more coders" infinitely.  The R&amp;D/Development teams already make up the VAST majority of CCP staff.  They have people working on fixing bugs.  Maybe not the absolute maximum number of staff that they could, but enough that adding more will not just magic the bugs away.  You can't just throw QA infinitely and fix problems faster.  Real life isn't a management sim, another person working 8 hours in your studio doesn't magically produce 8 man hours more work if they are working on the same issue as someone who was already there working on it.
---
Literally, I know at least a dozen players who are on discords and subscribed to this subreddit that are afk and not playing. They still keep up with the game but do not subscribe or log in. 
---
Ok fine, Ill admit it , I just wanna get rid of local. Dont give a damn about bots.
---
**In rust we--** oh wait
---
A ship that warps really fast but is super slow, has a big ish fleet hangar (think 20k M^3), and a bonus to salvage % chance as well as cycle time.

You could also give it a decent lock speed.

CCP needs to stop trying to increase (single instance) fight size. Its exponentially more hardware intensive,  for exponentially smaller benefit to the players involved. 
---
Okay, I am going to sound more flippant than I mean to, but when I read this I am reading... "Dear CCP, when you are done with your bug fixes, please spend your resources and time implementing a ship that maybe 6 people in the game will be able to fly. Thanks."
---
Or in other words, "Dear CCP, I am rich enough or important enough in a null sec alliance to afford an Angel Titan (and who wants to fly one). I may be one of 6 players in the game for whom this is the case, so please spend your time building and balancing a ship *just for me.* Fuck everyone else's game experience." 
---
It would be awesome if after a few salvaged wrecks of the same ship (pvp wrecks only) the t2 salvager just spawned a brand new hull inside its hangar bay.

&gt; you can use the cargo drop option to drop your loot into any citadel, then asset safety it out.

Multiboxing gives you alot of advantages in fleet combat, if your 80-100 hundred humans in fleet can all dual box or triple box it extremely improves the performance of your fleet. i personally run 5 accounts (sub main, Dread/Fax, Fax/Dread, Super, Titan).
---
For running missions its not really required, if you moved out to nullsec though and joined a new player alliance like Horde then it would become useful for you to at least have 1 alt account pretty early on, and from their onward just keep adding them as you need. 
---
I personally have been up to 7 accounts, but i think 5 accounts is the perfect number for PVP.
---
They would have to create a function that allowed outside persons who design skins, that would then need some function to be uploaded to the test server for testing, then to the live server.  Again, this is a lot of effort both in actual coding and design to create a totally new function that hasn't been done before to a game that is, let's admit, delicate.  Sure, CCP does custom logos for alliances but they only do that in significant batches and not one by one ^by ^one ^^by ^^one ^^^ by ^^^one ^^^^ad ^^^^nasuem.
---
This is, of course, setting aside (well, complete side stepping) the issue that **They still haven't fixed Jita Local after several months** so how successful do you think creating an entirely new function will be when they can't keep local working?
---
There are plenty of communities you can explore. Just to spitball a couple, there is Spectre Fleet, a group channel where anyone from anywhere can join their fleets where you'll be led into low/null sec space to fight other groups or just looks for targets. Bombers Bar does the same thing with cloaky ships. TVP (The Valhalla Project) and WTM (Warp To Me) are groups that host high sec incursions fleets. Can net you up to 200 mill and hour which could be a good option to get you on your feet.

Incorrect. The ECJ Case 582/14 – Patrick Breyer v Germany has ruled that an IP is PII .
---
No, that's nonsense. 
---
Oh ya. Not disagreeing with any of that. I'm just saying, IF they wanted to satiate the players and still profit off of it (and I think it could be well worth their while if done correctly) that it could really be pretty simple, relatively speaking. Wasn't even implying that they will. In fact, I highly doubt it. Would be cool though, and just have some sort of approval system. Skins are purchased, made outside the game using approved editors, submitted, some guy goes through them, approves them, and viola. Players would have some sort of waiting period for the approval process and some guidelines/rules for content. I'd love to see it but I doubt it will happen, at least anytime soon. I really hope they get things together and soon, it's an amazing and unique game and at this point there should be 100k+ REAL individual players IMO. Stop adding ships n shit and work on getting a more friendly new player experience and adding players while fixing things. I just came back after a long hiatus and remember why I loved and hated this game.. lol

Is damage negated/mitigated while sieging a citadel in a "Low Power" state? or is it the same as normal, except no armor layer RF period?
---
Thanks
---
Basically do it triple boxed in most assault frigates, even T2 fits work.  The reward is hilariously broken compared to the risk VS trying to run them in cruiser.  Great job CCP for completely killing cruiser abyss with the frigate ones \\o/
---
Same here. Im playing fallout 76, and  Astroneers. I hope on eve like once a month.
---
I didn't say ruin, I said screw up. Big difference. Lots of things have screwed up the game without ruining it.
---
As far as removing local goes, I don't think most people advocating for that have really considered how that will play out. They seem to think the miners/ratters will just continue without taking the change into consideration, and not adapt to them at all, giving them plenty of targets that can't see them coming. In reality you'll find they will adapt, and the new tactics they'd have to use would make them far harder targets to catch.
---
You'd likely find that the random targets currently strewn throughout null-sec would consolidate into smaller areas where they could easily scout entrances, or even just join the big blocs for the protection of their super umbrellas.
---
Personally if they removed local I would simply stop ratting and mining in null altogether. The risk-vs-reward balance outside of a super-umbrella would tip in such a way that it wouldn't be worth it. I'd probably just drop some mining/ratting alts and go do Abyssal sites or incursions in high-sec.
---
So that he can start fixing bugs!
---
Salvage tackle*
---
It is fairly common to have 2+ accounts in Eve. In your very early stages of the game you can still crosstrain and test out whatever catches your interest without having wasted too many SP. However at a later stage, once you have found your gameplay, you will specialise anyway.
---
Multiboxing is a way of compensating the neglected skills in some way. I have a cap pilot and an "everything else but combat"-alt. While my cap pilot is also heavily crosstrained into all sorts of subcaps, my alt is barely able to fly a good-ish Drake (if it comes to combat at all), but is quite good at mining and building stuff and often used as a forward scout/cyno.
---
But multiboxing is also popular in PvP, where people would run their own gangs, or ride the logi tandem all by themselves (basically being the "two unit" healer)

In the Rattlesnake? No. I am just using the MWD to move around, I find no need for the MJD at all.  Just watch the drones and pull them in when they start taking damage. 
---
Last room, kill the station bookmark the can, warp out, wait a \~5 minutes for the site to despawn, warp to can, collect loot.
---
&gt; WH ratting is quite profitable (C3 and C5 mostly) but not infinite
---
I disagree. If you live in a hole w/ a C3 static you can roll the hole for sites. Never had an issue doing this and consistently pulled down upwards of 225-250m an hour in a Rattlesnake ezmode.
---
Thank you

What about being able to jettison things from he wreck that are bigger than a jetcan? Or give it an ability to do an inefficient reprocess on mods and store the materials in a mineral bay? Something to make it able to ninja salvage supercaps.

---
In the case of CCP, it would be because it's associated with an account. Otherwise it seems it depends.
---
I dont support the capitalists. Subcapatilist only.
---
True
---
So should CCP fire the art team, to then use that wages budget on programmers. Then when the programmers are done, fire them, and hire new art devs? Or do you want the art team to sit on their ass and do nothing

Yep, I cannot see a single reason why triple boxing assfrigs would be unappealing compared to a single cruiser.

We increase fight sizes, not CCP. Every time they improve performance, alliances cram more people in. I remember when a 100 man fight led to soul crushing lag.

Well ... Yes you are ratting in C3 :p

isn't that... perfectly fine?

You can cancel your recuring payement to save a month of not paying your subscription and buy 500 PLEX instead. That's almost the same, you loose maybe a bit if you have a long time subscription but it's still close.

Most people either salvage with total control, or ninja salvage in disposable ships.  I'm suggesting that strategically salvaging in the course of battle be viable.   I've fought off a huge number of fleets in my staging, where we won only due to reships.  If the aggressor had a viable way to field dress the enemy hulls, it would provide more risk and more reward.
---
Simple because null sec can be made perfectly safe.
---
When the safety wasn't that absoluut people tend to spread out more so that they can be safe by being harder to find.
---
The fact that numbers are more important then skill is the problem.
---
Eve was bether when smaller groups were not so easyly overwhemlmed by numbers.
---
It being a hull specific bonus would encourage it's use, and thus it's death.
---
Windrunners are like your entire identity eh
---
neither, i have nothing against the art team and never said anything about them getting fired. i want ccp to fix the damn game. and understand that from a consumer's pov it's pretty frustrating when shit doesn't work for months but you always get more options of making it prettier. just to be clear, i'm not even talking balance here. i'm talking basic functions like chat, market, borked grid and so on.
---
They wouldn't stop, mate. I would, because I don't want to move to Delve to do it, but there'll be plenty of Rorqual mining happening over there. The global supply of minerals would come from the null-empires, much like it does today.
---
The increased risk/effort of mining and ratting outside the null-empire super umbrellas would mean it would only really happen there. So if you enjoy hunting ratters/miners, I guess your choices would be to do the Bombers Bar thing, or recruit a few hundred Titan pilots for Rorqual drops.
---
If you haven't already, train your scaning skills. It is vital to navigate in J space. As already mentioned Covert Ops is a mandatory asset. Try to remain cloaked at all times, only decloak when needed. Focus on these so you get it learn your environment first. Good starter ships are the Exploration frigates then later move on to SOE ships when your more comfortable,  T3s or whatever your corp wishes.
---
If you can fly exploration frigates you could contribute as an active scout and help find content, or just do hacking sites. Very fun and ideal role for a newb in WH.
---
Later on you will learn the rest .with time..
---
The exploration ships are a great way to make ISK, and relatively low risk investment. You will also improve your scanning and awareness skills overtime. Good luck.
---
Is multiboxing(send keystrokes to multiple clients) allowed?  
---
If so, any free ones you recomentd?
---
Which part of my comment are you referring to? I specifically quoted the part where you said "not infinite", which I explained is not technically true. The beauty of WH statics is you can indefinitely roll for sites if that's what you're looking for.
---
Are they actually goons still? The goons that started years ago we only called that because the SA forums. Most modern goons probably have no idea what that is let along they came from there.
---
In my corp, we purchase all of the ore mined during the op and then distribute the ISK evenly among all those who participated (adjusted for the time they were at the op).
---
That’s a pretty simple way of doing it. If you aren’t able to mine it all in one go, you can always implement a buyback program where people can contract the ore to your Corp for a calculated price (something my corp also does).
---
Spreadsheets are VERY helpful for all this, by the way. Feel free to send me a message if you have more specific questions (or on the off-chance you’d consider a merger). I’m happy to help, regardless.
---
Uh, market hubs?
---
Obviously your German. :) 
---
1) Instead of going to what i'm sure was a considerable effort to string together those words into complete sentences, you might have just said "you salty", as that's pretty much the equivalent meaning while also being succinct.  The only reddit bois I've actually seen mention the BL titan dunking are amrass and hywanto. It was a big loss for sure and I was a little sad but was replaced pretty quickly by god emperor elo so I don't really have much reason to be salty :)
---
2) If you think that literally anyone believes that Snuff is a strong independent entity from gons, you've got another thing commin friendo.
---
Or just link all accounts to the same email fam.
---
PM me your in game name and we will make sure to get you on the memorial roam. 
---
I think these are all valid points. I still contend removing Local would wrench up the meta long enough to produce some interesting results.
---
Totally fair assessment, I don't think anyone would fault people for being cautious especially now that the acquisition is still fresh but hopefully it goes in a beneficial direction for all involved.
---
you downvote him, but he's not wrong
---
We are painfully aware Init can out form us but where is the fun in that if we are just blobbed with 1000 nerds?   
---
Hell, I am pretty sure Init can out form us with just caps if you don't factor Snuff in our numbers. 
---
you should also stop posting
---
Who are you talking about specifically?  
---
Got mine, good to go
---
To be perfectly honest, I think that was more enjoyable than having a cap brawl.  GF Init 
---
Looks good, but waaaaay too bright to set as a desktop background.
---
which is how it is anyway, so..... 
---
Awesome video as always. That ferox fight kinda hurt me to watch though - he's rail fit, go for a tighter orbit!
---
Pretty sure they are just mad about the mtu they lost. They got more titans than mtus. 
---
In my career of 20+ years in development I see this frustration and argument over and over and over. 
---
The thing is, slapping a shiney new frontend on something broken is easy, and cheap. Fixing 15 years of technical debt, and undocumented spaghetti is extremely difficult and very expensive. 
---
Due to the structure of the code there is also only a certain number of developers you can put on that backend code before you start to see people treading on toes. Too many cooks.. etc 
---
So the stupidity of the argument here is that people assume bugs aren't being fixed quickly because there's not enough developers. Then proceeding to assume CCP cant afford any developers so they should fire the art team to save money. 
---
In reality more developers wouldn't help. And firing the art team would just mean you have a buggy game with no new content at all. 
---
Boosting for two miners probably doesn't increase the yield as much as sticking the booster in another procurer. Save the boosts for when your fleet is 4+ actual miners. Put the boosters on a tractor unit in range of using Upwell Deposit so he can just drag from tractor unit into the deposit window. Have the miners all jetcan. Use the corp mining ledger the next day for payouts (volume mined = time, so you don't need to track when people joined/left fleet). Pay the boosters based on the bonuses he gave to yield.
---
I changed the original quote ;)
---
Sure. CCP needs to introduce mechanics to disincentivize n+1 combat. Endless escalation is an uphill battle that can't be won. 
---
Despite the hate, Fozzie sov was an attempt at least. 
---
Not really. Right now you can roam through null-sec trying to catch a ratters/miners that aren't paying attention, or who simply haven't learned how to do it properly yet. That won't be an option if you remove local; nobody will be there anymore.
---
I suspect you missed the whole free to play thing eh?
---
BleasRNG CCP
---
who said that was part of the pack? 
---
so maybe now you have had a look into things you understand. all the goodies in there plus the monthly subs, plex and multi character training, oh yeah i better not forget about skins because you like it. makes it a dlc. all of that gets downloaded into your account. its an extra witch you paid money for and after the transaction happened you get it into ur account.  
---
BOOM  just let that sink in for a minute.........

---
now these packages at some point have gone down on sale by 60%! just profits

Ships are ammo. Losing one means you just need to get another. Once you realise that Eve can be a lot of fun. If you get hung up on losses it can be not so fun.

It doesn’t really count as an academic paper unless it’s published in a peer reviewed journal...

It was a Rage joke..... haven't you heard? INIT is the meme of 2019
---
Quoting my other comment here on this:
---
&gt; An active battlefield salvager might also sound cool, but is an FC really gonna trade an actual combat ship for it? And would either side really want a 3rd party to come in and steal the battlefield spoils of the victor?
---
I'm open to being proven wrong.
---
Counterpoint: literally nobody on sa actually cares, and it would be stupid to change a highly recognizable name just because the connection to the forum that spawned it is increasingly tenuous
---
So yes, 'goons' works, and still will as long as the alliance name is some variation of 'goonswarm'

Yes, very.

I thought we were talking about CCP, not Microsoft
---
O wait.
---
it's not
---
Skins are PLEX, omega is PLEX, all of that is PLEX. You get a sell on PLEX, you get a sale on all of that. Sure it doesn't get 60% because CCP isn't retarded and then you're not asking for more packages you're asking for more very interesting sales.
---
&gt; how does eve fix the pvp player vs pve players issue
---
It doesn't, this game allows for griefing towards PVE players than most MMO's out there
---
a warp to zero bot is so funny and easy to make, it takes literally 5 minutes
---
&gt; Not a super impressive video
---
I must agree but then you also have the balls to publish this and own your mistakes. That's all part of the learning process. Keep it up dude! 
---
I mean, even a dev with zero art skills can produce 100% authentic Minmatar ships....
---
Most of the people i know mine for themselves and give the owner of the moon (usually the corp) 10 or 20% of the ore depending on the type of moon.  If the orca  or someone else is hauling you should tip him too.  Otherwise, adding it all up and dividing it equally is unfair in my opinion is unfair as  it doesnt take into account the different efforts people put in - for instance someone skills into a skiff mines more then the procurer, etc. . .
---
\+1 this reccomendation
---
Says someone flairbaiting as snuff.... sure thing, honey, whatever you say XD
---
That fight was over a week ago but definitely learned if I ever fight one again I'll be orbiting it tight! Lol 
---
Why do you think he was banned?
---
Ain't ever gonna learn without studying mistakes. Thanks for the encouragement! :)
---
The VPN service assigns multiple clients to a shared IP address (hence anonymity) in place of your real IP address. It's possible you get assigned an IP address that was previously or currently in bad standing with EVE (other people used IP for botting, rmt, etc). EVE assumes you are a botter since botters used that IP before.
---
Well, scout the guns first ideally - if he's blaster fit you'll want to find the edge of his range and just kite him out while holding point. Rail fit - get in tight and orbit 500 so he has tracking issues. Rails are more common of course but you never know. 
---
I have two omega accounts that I run at the same time but I'd like a third alpha toon to just sit in jita. What's the best way to get that going on one computer? 
---
Exactly this, and then balance what you fly to what you can afford. There is alot of great pvp to be had without risking huge stacks of cash. Just look at all the recent nano retribution fad (I am sure there is a range of opinions on these) but they are fun and cheap.
---
Oh yeah and lose less , unhelpful I know but it happens for some people.
---
See they can't even catch me! I planned this with my eagles and destroyed them all! FXR is ripping itself apart looking for me! I've been with them since -insert well known time frame here-. Next up Evictus will telling test what to do!
---
I think Lanngisi and Apanake are better agents for SoE (0.5 systems, not 0.7 -- more LPs, higher ISK payout and (if you do some scanning now and when) more lucrative combat sites).
---
It's relatively easy to get into Lvl 4 SoE missions, because you get a lot of standing for this corp during the epic arc. But besides this, it's not great in my opinion. The HS agents are very far from each other, so effectively you have only one. You'll run into trouble frequently because of the missions you HAVE to decline and absolutely can't afford to decline those, which you simply don't like.
---
When I lived in HS for a few months, I did missions for Republic Fleet. Gulfonodi (0.5) and Gelfiven (0.6) are 2 jumps apart and have 2 Lvl 4 and 3 Lvl 3 agents. There are 4 more Lvl 4 agents 3-5 jumps away into relatively quiet lowsec - you don't want to bring the standard PvE ship there, but a Kestrel for team burners is only ~15M, so checking them is always an option, too. Thus you can decline much more freely. Yes, you sometimes have to decline a mission because it would send you to LS, but that's quite rare for standard missions (burners are 90% LS, though).
---
About the ships: I prefered a passive Gila. It can run all standard missions (not burners). Maybe a bit slower than a battleship, but more relaxed, much less actions per minute. And the faster align and warp speed gets a lot of the "lost" time back.
---
Its worth to try it at least - it’s free!
---
Personally I’ve recently crossed 15 years of playing (on and off) I always come back to eve.
---
As to being a threat to everyone.... I’m certainly not a threat to everyone! I’ve been killed by players only a few days / weeks old, although not usually 1 v 1. Eve is a giant game of paper, scissor, stone only with more than 3 options.
---
There’s tons of different things to try in eve, so if you don’t like something or you don’t like the people you are doing it with....then simply move on and try something else and / or someone else.
---
Very good points. Just gotta remember to check what my opponents are running when I find fights like that. Surprisingly hard to run through that mental checklist in the heat of the moment :p
---
And T2 salvage drones while your at it as well CCP. 
---
Sorry, I aint that knowledgable of the game in anything but highsec :)
---
For certain values of "unique" yes.
---
Right I know that but there isn't a general ban on vpn, right?
---
&gt; Just knit-picking,
---
aaarrrrgghhhh
---
&gt;  server setup that can handle modern fleet fights
---
You *do* realize that CCP has some of the most advanced hardware out there in terms of raw horsepower and they've adopted bleeding edge top of the line technology multiple times in the past, right? 
---
There's literally not much they can do for modern fleet fights, we as a player base constantly one-up them in terms of what tech they have vs the load *we* put on the backend hardware. They already operate some of the most powerful servers (spec wise) in the world that are actually capable of handling the specific type of load the game generates. 
---
Throwing 20,000 CPU cores at the server farm wouldn't help, because by nature the game server is single threaded, and there's only so fast a single CPU core can process data. Some tasks *can* be offloaded to to other threads, but the core "Player 1 shoots player 2 for 30 dmg" cycle MUST be run by a single thread. 
---
Think of it like this, if you're playing D&amp;D with 50 friends in a single game, everyone does things one by one in turns. Having a 2nd DM to oversee the game would not make the entire game go 100% faster, or even 0.001% faster, because player 23 still has to wait for player 22 to roll his dice. There's simply no way to speed this process up by adding DM's (servers) 
---
The game literally operates at the limit of the technology we can produce as humans at this point in time, CCP can't simply spend more money to fix a problem that's based in the laws of physics that govern our universe. There's simply no refuting this fact, and no arguments that can change this fact.
---
A WH mapper, google Siggy or tripwire or pathfinder.  You will see what I mean
---
"VPN were one of the reasons but not the only" WTF does that even mean? CCP is keeping a tally of how many bad things you do incase they decide to pull the plug?
---
"WT kill my wife and fuck my sister, cockblocked by the pope?"
---
At least you are free now, Fly my neet fly high into the sky :D

---
That doesn't mean "have the art team do technical work". It means "lay off the art team and hire tech people" 
---
Totally understand - but as cloaky bois you guys get the benefit of getting to scout your prey before you pounce (sometimes), so take a few seconds and build up the habit of right-click &gt; look-at and get used to identifying those guns when you can.

This, but corm. The salcorm looks better. 
---
Nice. I wanna do more Minmatar ships, but they can be pretty frustrating with all the scaffolding and partially attached panels and shit. 
---
Polarized Hecate is best bet for scanning and killing MTUs on one toon, that said if the mission is still active or the ratter actually shoots at you, you are going to die in seconds.
---
A better options for scanning, killing MTUs and potentially killing angry ratters would be a blaster Proteus or HAM/Neut Legion.
---

First, Go with Covetors. You will mine so much more in less time and they are like what. 35M??? Skiff/procurer isn't worth sacrifice in yield for defense. In fact the Covetor is ONLY out-yielded by the Hulk. They are cheap and will not bring attention.
---
Second, it's good to do at least one mining-op per week that is solely for corp resources. Unless you are all playing to PLEX accounts, I would recommend corp only ops so you can start building for pvp/pve fun... frigs, destroyers and even cruisers really don't take much in resources to get a good stock going.
---
Also, pm me if you are looking for more members. 
---
no fucking way, is that a phantasm fleet ?

The idea of what a "goon" is in EVE is based on the actions of the group of players that used the name, regardless of the original connection to SA. While it used to have significance, it doesn't matter anymore. And SA itself isn't that well known too, most people who hear the word goon and don't think of the SA forums.
---
Multiboxing is allowed but not mass input transmitting. So you have to alt-tab and activate modules in each account.
---
Isboxer helps manage lots of accounts and doesnt violate the eula if you just use it to manage your windows but not to mass input. 
---
When I was in INIT FXR dropped 10 carriers on our HAC fleet, in range to our super staging (or like, a few jumps). I'm not sure if you can bait those dude. They do love to brag that's for sure tho.

It's against the EULA to use an alpha with any other characters. Nobody can give you advice on ways to do it, as it is a bannable offense.

---
From my understanding it seems to be automatic(?) Depending on the VPN used I guess, all of a sudden you log in in another country which might trigger an automatic 'ban' so that any potential hackers can't access your account.
---
In that case it looks like getting in touch with support has helped out, hasn't it? Or are people banned for VPN and not something else in addition to that, without getting it lifted, for sure?
---
I use Eve-O preview, it's free from the Eve forum (Google it). As the other poster said input broadcasting isn't allowed so you need to turn that off if you use something like isboxer. 
---
Join horde, no pap requirements or anything. You can try and just rat, but sure enough the PVP bug will get ya ;)

---
It has the same resists and damage cap, but has less hp and only has one reinforcement cycle. 
---
If you have t2 boost, t2 crystals, t2 mining drones, and want to risk a hulk in high sec, its marginally better with even just 2 accounts, and then theres less hauling time. I ran the numbers the other day and was surprised, must be the orca buff to mining drones? 
---
I would start on the high value ores if youre not likely to clean the belt - just restarted my own athanor this week, im not going to clear it dual boxing &amp; estimate 5-6hrs just to clear the high value.
---
Jetcans and tractirs is interesting, had thought about it but couldnt work out a method where the boost &amp; anchor ranges worked?
---
Eve mogul is a popular one, I don't use it myself so not too sure if it does what you need. 
---
Oh ok. I'll just sub it then. 
---
That's a reasonable suggestion if the art department isn't a net positive on the balance sheet.
---
But it is highly likely that the art department's budget is recouped, if not exceeded, by the revenue it generates through new skins and cosmetics. Any operating income can then be used to fund things that we care more about.
---
As long as the art department isn't losing money, it doesn't harm other development efforts and might actually benefit them. 
---
Good post. I wish you all peace.
---
I would recommend not starting. Mission running is one of the most boring things to do in the game. The ISK is poor as well so you don’t even have a decent reward for your time. 
---
The Art Team seems to be the only team left here
---
Maybe he's right. We dont really know.
---
Great advice above, if youre not up to level 4s yet, dont worry about multiboxing. Its expensive aaaand capitals are too tempting. Mine are gathering dust most of the time, yet I still keep both accounts running.
---
Oh I just need another alt for... hauling, trade, pve, cynos, ice mining, logi, ... the list continues
---
Its not so much that you used a VPN, its that thier logs show your accounts having been coming in from your regular IP, then all of a sudden, one day immediately after downtime, someone tries to login to your accounts from a very different IP, and they probably recognize it as a vpn as well. 
---
Although in my mind, such an occurence should only result in the accounts being locked, not perma-banned. 
---
Covetors are gank bait in highsec, I'd avoid using them there.
---
&gt; grinding through SF structures while bleeding ships in the process
---
Yes... Losing literally tens of millions in ships, for the few hundred billion in structures...
---
how can it be so hard to understand he's talking bout snuff, jesus
---
Also if you happen to be a coder, you can rarely hire any experienced software developers. Anyone who is capable and motivated already has a job, and although the game is great you couldn't pay me enough to join a 10 year old + project just to work on bugs. Companies are competing for talent and it's just not a selling point to join a name brand when you can make more money and have a much better lifestyle building a product with a newer codebase and reduced product roadmap.
---
Excuse my ignorance, but you and another poster(OP) have both said the 1-2Bil looting isnt worth it.
---
I'm a complete Eve noob and spend more time reading about it than playing.  How in the world is 1-2Bil not worth the effort? 
---
Even if its as op said split between 5 guys, thats 200MIL each.   Does it take like 3hrs to down the bot or something?  200Mil an hour seems like pretty damn good money.
---
Enlighten me!
---
It’s still insane you think that period of time is a decent turn around for something that requires a subscription to access. It’s not like it’s free to play and you are doing this out of the good of your heart. You are being paid and should do your job in a timely manor like everyone else in a paid position is expected to.

for using a vpn

So.. hypothetically speaking, if I'm playing Eve, and I have a roommate who wants to play Eve, we're both on alpha accounts, and we're on the same network but using different computers and different accounts, does the violate the EULA?
---
Well ... this is embarrassing ... I don't remember you or that fight. Sorry.
---
... because exaggerated analogies don't make a point?
---
&gt; If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number
---
how ironic, if it's a big deal please message a dev on reddit
---
lmfao
---
&gt;CCP needs to introduce mechanics to disincentivize n+1 combat.
---
How is that really possible without nuking the current game? Fozzie sov reduced power projection across the map, but didn't really affect how many people can show up to a fight give enough planning/notice. 
---
This game gives incentives to playing in larger and larger groups. If you want to get rid of n+1 combat you no longer have the sandbox play style that many people enjoy. TBH, I don't know you could get rid of n+1 without breaking the game. 
---
If they are happy as a group of people, I can only wish them well. I do wish they would change corp names, however.
---
Volt + Goons = huge cringe.
---
You should check out his post history. It is like a drunk toddler stumbling about. :D
---
when did it left?
---
You won 2/3 fights because of EC Drones
---
Was gone for a few months. 
---
It would be a grate idea. Especially the removed anom spawn, so even less regular player would be able to make money.
---
Wormholes are an example.
---
Its really about trying to reduce concentration than count.  Ie multiple fights across multiple systems. The largest battles could be constellation wide 
---
That would be ok as it's different people. I have a friend who uses two omegas and his wife plays an alpha on a laptop. The violation would be in the same person using the alpha (hard to prove) or using it on the same computer that is also running another account.
---
I bet you also graduated top of your navy seals class
---
Not to mention the fact that their main office where the majority of their workforce is located and they will likely want you to relocated to is based in what could possibly be the definitive example of "nice place to visit, wouldn't want to live there" and thats from someone who has visited and lived there for 2 years.
---
The art department is actually completely irrelevant to why that suggestion is rational.
---
I like that you speak in terms of monetary value of the departments. The monetary value of the "bug and balance department" depends on the player turmoil and negative reaction caused by the bugs. Unfortunately that's what Eve has come into. CCP has a policy of not fixing anything unless there is a huge outcry that can risk their bottom line. Therefore, should they want some bugs to be fixed, it's perfectly rational for people to stir all kinds of shit on r/Eve and other mediums. Including "we don't want/won't buy any SKINs until you fix bugs".
---
No, fortunately, i did not get lost on my way to college 
---
Is it still stuck in that c7 wh rzr was in?
---
Wormhole mechanics just throttle people coming in. Scaling that to a large null group would make taking territory impossible if you can have 10000 dudes in you home system and the invaders have to come in 100 at a time. 
---
I do like the idea of constellation size fights - that is a good step, but most of the large fights now are over structure timers i.e one system. Some sort of constellation sized fight to determine if the keepstar armor is destroyed?
---
Pretty sure AAR is WC shot fortizar.   
---
Russians blobbed WC but failed despite having a lot more.   
---
3rd party failed multiple times to bomb various parties.  
---
Recording person forgot to use their gay set and judging by layout of the windows onscreen, should never do interior design.  
---
WC logi anchoring is on point, russians don't seem to actually know what a logi anchor is.   
---
Razor was found, mostly on lossmails.  
---
WC had more carriers and a lot less subs than russians but russians did not know how to press adc.  
---
TLDR Russians dead, WC kills fort.
---
Those are big boasts to make for someone who can't even cyno alt right

I’m so curious about people like you bitching about everything being broken. I’ve been playing this game daily for about 6 months and it’s been nothing but a minor inconvenience at times. What specifically isn’t working on a daily basis?
---
WARDECS have their place, but is abused by some, and drives potential Omegas away. wardecs need limitations, length of dec, number of times a corp or alliance can be decced, etc. weve got corps out there that will dec corps permanenetly to their end. Empire space is for carebears and players that are not interested in the constant combat of NULLSEC or these "Nuisance Decs" as I like to call them. Everyone plays for a different reason, some just want to shoot roids and build stuff, others want to master the art of combat.There is a clear and defined line that is skewed by the WARDEC. And yes , it does ultimately impact the entire game and CCPs bottom line I would imagine.This is a solid game, and I do believe more would play and play longer without all the BS. new players are subjected too.
---
Underrated comment. 
---
I was gonna point out too that you can't just hire a bunch of Python/C++/whatever coders off the street and expect them to know how to fix 15 year old legacy code. But it seems a lot of people think that every game that runs on Python must be fucking identical or something.
---
Mate...
---
techically the 1st fight isn't with provi dudes, atleast not anyone i know.
---
They are throwaway cheap and again, only out-yielded by a Hulk. A Skiff, worth 7 or 8 Covetors is worthless yield wise in comparison. Also, if you're mining within 5 jumps of Jita or Amarr you are doing it wrong anyway. Gankers are lazy cowards. They don't stray far from hubs and nobody wastes a gank on a 35M Covetor. 
---
Not at all. Pair programming can work amazingly. It's the new hot shit in the programming world. Even 2 people on the same computer, get stuck and tag your mate in. Heaps of companies do this when they get stuck 
---
Ban reviews should have a high priority. It is a potentially loyal customer that you are terminating.
---
I think it's a new Dominix SKIN.
---
You should go anywhere except high sec. There are lots of options. When I had the pvp itch I join a newbie friendly null alliance (despite having played the game for many years) and I found it to be really enjoyable. It’s often derided on this sub but it’s definitely a fun play style and if you join one of the big newbie corps in a null alliance, you’ll typically have a lot of companions to both learn from and fight with. 
---
You can also go the wh or faction warfare route, I don’t have a ton of experience in either but those can be fun plays styles as well. 
---
In Rens the ship would be stripped to the infrastructure.
---
Oh reeeeeeally?!
---
XD
---
[🦀RGSU IS GONE🦀](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6sYOSdntDg)
---
Yea that's something I'd like to see, definitely making objectives with hit points across a constellation for single systems. 
---
Also lol I wouldn't extend WH mechanics to the entire game. I'm just using it as proof that healthy and interesting ways to throttle escalations is possible. 
---
&gt; CODESpanDeliveryService should formally merge into 1 alliance.
---
Do CODE and Wingspan actually play together?  At least from the outside, they seem like they've got comparatively little in common.
---
Combat site running. A stratios can handle all sites in highsec and is a good scanner too. 
---
They have very little to do with one another other than being somewhat RP groups.
---
Savage babbler?
---
Hah, when you left in a hurry we thought you were reshipping. And then funnily enough it took us one or two minutes to realize it was a NVAC Devoter, i was about ready to commit to him. That would have been a good whelp.
---
&gt; Have someone look over the skin to make sure it meets community Guidelines 
---
lol, millions of skins would be submitted, most of the garbage. It would take a whole team, even with machine learning to do this. 
---
+2 this recommendation 
---
because f1 monkeys need someone to project their frustations on.
---
They should keep pressing f1, or try alt+f4
---
\+3
---
Lmao, at least it’s not GS anymore I guess.
---
You aren’t dead yet?
---
+3 this recommendation
---
In the modern era of polical correctness, we have to call them 'Richards' now.
---
This. I am dreading the day Eve goes offline because I really like the game overall and I fear there will never be another one like it. Criticism is okay but we need to be careful about bashing and giving the people who put time and money into the game a bad vibe because there’s a lot of people who just want to continue playing this game for years to come. 
---
If Eve went offline we would have a swarm of complaints. 
---
all the world do it, have been on reddit
---
what are u laughing at
---
He never returned with the grid squares
---
I get that you aren't an Eve player but damn, chill 
---
Oh well I don't consider that really meme worthy.  :)
---
PREACH FELLOW CAPSULEER
---
A majority of veterans and people who have found their niche in making money can make well over 500M per hour doing mind-numbing activities. Others can make billions in a few hours worth depending their infrastructure, time, and dedication.
---
We were all in your shoes once. Keep playing and find your niche.
---
I have 1200hours and 9b in the bank, say that again
---
I would love to see a minmatar ship tagged like that. A friend really likes the Typhoon, how much for the ISK comission ?
---
you think the trash will magically get better at Eve with no local?
---
should be unanimously yes then 
---
minokiwis confirmed op
---
this is such a cringe post, legacy pets are honestly the worst pets in the game.
---
Like tnt,bastion and lawn have enough self-awareness to realise they are pets and they dont smug post, but holy shit, this is a new level of autism.
---
You dont see many posts on reddit bragging about 11b in kills for a reason. 
---
uhh you know a lot of skins are found in various loot cans and such, right?
---
Idgi did they really get kicked for mining in the wrong system. Eli5, how does goon policy's work with mining
---
eh if they paid about double of what i expect they pay and would allow working remote 90% of the time i'd be down
---
i kinda fell its fine, when we have +2000 more titan in the game since cap plate was put into the game.
---
Those are rookie numbers, nothing wrong with it, but don't use it to show off.
---
try pvp-ing for example lol. see how fun it is when u can't see anything landing on your grid and ships just pop up on ur overview at 5km next to u after exiting warp. or modules randomly going offline after jumping gates. or ur scram not stopping cycling even though the guy u fought has been dead for 2 minutes. or the dscan fuck up which makes shit disappear when u scan at 5. sounds like u station trade or mine or something that's not particularly demanding from a ui pov. which is fine but don't assume the whole game works just cause what ur doing doesn't need the stuff that's broken.
---
Technically amok doesn't have their own system. It is free system for all. 
---
From the information I can get it's unknown what happened. 
---
GHSOL, cheap and quick.
---
Here's the thing.
---
If shit's fucked - i'll let them know.
---
if shit's not fucked - i'll be busy playing the game. also, doing basic things correctly doesn't mean i need to come on here and suck their cock about it, them getting my money is the only feedback they need.
---
Yeah to be fair, this is much more uncommon 
---
Don't change the noctis, make a salvaged dessi and then make a t2 salvager.
---
At least be honest about the reason, they were kicked for point blank refusing to do what they were told to by the person who decides on all GSF internal drama/fuckery/blueshooting bullshit.
---
When you're told "I am telling you to do this thing, it's not a request" and you reply with "no fuck you you're not my real dad" things happen.
---
Trasher or Scrapalyst. The punny names automatically make them better.
---
Wow, imagine being a pet in your own alliance.
---
That’s a lot of hours to not know that alt + f4 just activates a different module not quits the game 
---
FXR is a fun little group, i remember them trying to damp/jam our titans when we were shooting their fort
---
You go ahead and press alt+f4 in eve. 
---
Sooo... They just don't pay the art team for a few months to focus on bugs? How will they keep an art team? This argument is just as bad as thinking you can reallocate the artists to coding.
---
Capital loot is usually very large and tedious to haul to market to sell hence massively increasing the time and effort required, especially when you live in WH and routes to hisec are inconsistent at best. 
---
Yeah it's not terrible money but it's also inconsistent as can be, not all bots are the same and need time to figure them out or get alts that are on their bluelists. 
---
While it can take the more "pro" hunters a hour or two due to having the right tools in place, they have spent considerable time prepping for those eventualities. When I worked out that pocket of bots it probably took the best part of two evenings just testing until I could reliably catch them all.
---
Reliable PvE is more worthwhile if you have a day to farm. If I actually had time to PvE I would do a dread farm or turbo blitz L5's in a super. Currently I'm just chewing through market orders and making a few bil a month while not playing the game. In the end market PvP will always be potentially more profitable if you have some stacks to throw at it. 50b invested can easily return a few bill a month with weekly order updates.
---
That said, to you it probably is very good isk. I encourage you to investigate and figure out how to take bots down. The profit is waiting for you my dude :)
---
Wow, imagine alliances having rules and expecting members to follow them.
---
Yeah I totally agree, T2 salvage + tractor bonus's for the noctis and imo some basic salvage rof/ tractor range on the venture too, maybe instead of the warpcore bonus it current has.
---
Salcat and cormvager. 
---
Yeah, then you bubbled at anom by amok sabres and mobile bubbles and you see their supercapital fleet on top of you, i think everybody will kill that bubbles to escape from it. Am i wrong?
---
Uum...what? A noctis with a single LSE has more tank than that.
---
No. They got kicked for something different, /u/Service_Charge explained it.
---
There must be a reason beyond that for being kicked.
---
RGSU is the most active and skilled corp in imperium imo, and they lead participation metrics every month, meanwhile AMOK is a steaming pile of dogshit. So yer, must be more to it.
---
Sam has been doing this for many years. He really loves his coffee too.
---
absolute unit.
---
If this hasn't been fixed, check your drivers. New laptop I got had the wrong drivers installed (wtf windows) so my connection speed was SHIT
---
what a legend. raises coffee cup\*
