Can we still fight you?

it me dawg, 7th estate, we hugged n shit. remember i unanchored for you. UNANCHORED FOR YOU BRO

Or as I like to call it for short, TAPITAPI

You don't even need to use cheat engine you can literally just type in chat /give @a minecraft:diamond 64 if you enable cheats on your world
---
Oh yeah 7th Estate.... I'll be honest with you I did it for the free ships and content :3 plus the nudes.
---
I wanna be a pop star!
---
Are you retarded?  I don’t mean that ironically but
---

---
There’s a level of ignorance that beggars belief of a competent mind to be unable to read and discern meaning then try to deflect it to game mechanics
---
Why not?
---
remember i made my own 1 man alliance cuz i didnt wana join anyone. but if i had to pick it'd be you &lt;3 sad faces you dont remember me better. k bye gluck
---
Take care of Faction Warfare and Low Sec at all and stop ignoring it. There are tousands of player love FW, but the mechanics are so broken and there are no fixes or improvements at all, except the venture/bot fix (after how many years!?), so ppl just lose all hope and leave.
---
warlocks = dots
---
mages = crowd control
---
great mokey, now were gonna have a 3 man gang roaming through cache
---
I remember you but I need to meme where I can. &lt;3
---
Skilling REEEEEE is their content now.  Have fun!
---
Don't think that would work. Escalations are more or less random unless you run sites 24/7.
---
Getting 5-6 in a good weekend play session isn't unheard of though...
---
And even then how much would you charge for that "subscription". It's far too complex at this point...
---
The first 30 minutes that is designed to make new players think EVE PVE is something exciting, before dropping you into the 15 year old shit mission system.  You know, the thing they've remade about 10 times in the last couple years.
---
evictus who tis lol
---
3rd place winner looks like an attempt at EVE themed GOATSE
---
Winterco isn't in a position to kick anyone out of anywhere.
---
who?
---
Hey, I dont understand WHs. But when Exoo that seems to do says there are issues then I have to listen. Because I know he understands the space better than I do. And if he says there is basically no risk in WHs then I take that as something being wrong. Because your small group is farming more than the almost the entirety of Null or something like that right? 
---
Thats a huge issue. But the people talking about faucets dont really wanna talk about it since it will affect them.
---
And for the very same people to sit there and say, "hey look at these nullbears who are farming too much" it becames a wtf moment. 
---
But no matter, to go back to the first point. I understand that other know their space better than me, but others need to understand that some (not me) of us understands our space better. And if they say something wont work then it probably wont.
---
But you literally never lost anything outside of access.
---
Yeah you're right, hence them continuing to work on it. You don't stop until you get it right, that's good development.
---
Why would you not put MWD on a rolling BB?
---
Who says it was a rolling BB
---
It's an Abbadon with a Higgs. It's a roller.
---
Not really no. Because everyone supports (or should atleast) each other. You view is one a handful should light all the cynos. Maybe thats the way your Eve works but thats not my Eve, here we help eachother and most try to be useful.
---
And being able to light cynos is useful som most will train recons in time just as most had cyno alts from before.
---
Well it’s not
---
Oh there's definitely a way and I am sure he's figured it out and is just hoping others don't. It's just harder and costs a freighter which can't sit cloaked.
---
There's a method to out play scamming, there is not a method to our play this.
---
Because you can counter a scam by being smarter, can't counter this.
---
You guys volunteered to join up one of the biggest wars on this server for the past few years and you came out stronger. Be proud of everything you accomplished. Stay together, have fun, and we'll see you down the road.
---
thanks been fun fighting test
---
Thanks
---
I dunno m8, r/eve can be a funny old place at times. The thing you linked seems to be more about formatting than anything else though.
---
Idk man, cant remember everything hes written.
---
The cyno change was bad, and the thing is, I actually enjoy it since Im living in a bloc. Because it actually made us safer. But I know it is inherently bad for the game. Which is why I argue against it. 
---
Yes, that was it. This is what people lost their shit over. I mean for me, and I have written this multiple times during the BO, it meant that CCP just forgot about balance and did some shit to appease a minority with cheers. You do remember how people were loving it dont you?
---
I said exactly what you are saying, that the blackout has to came last in a chain of changes to make sense, not first. You never implement the worst thing first because no one is gonna stick around to see the good changes. 
---
But for reals now, it was never gonna work. The issue is that cloaks are not a big issue with local and so on. So no matter what you do, a blackout will never really work because you are creating a shitload of other issues that will need balance and those changes will need balance in interaction with eachother. 
---
It just creates a massive clusterfuck of changes for several years. And its simply not worth it for something like no local. And no matter what people were saying, they were loving being massively OP in a no local environment and they wouldnt stick around if they lost their OP-ness, which we currently are seeing. Which means a balanced blackout would never work, instead it would just eat up most dev time for years to come.
---
Simply not worth it. We have much bigger issues and you first have to start with changes that affect the most people. Like sov, like citadels and so on. If the day comes when the game is pretty much perfect and local is still an issue, then fine lets talk about it. But we are not there yet.
---
And to state my actual opinion, a 15-30 sec delay when entering a system or until gatecloak breaks is quite fine imo. There are issues but can iterated on. Thats a middleground that doesnt require breaking everything else and I think it would work quite fine for most. 
---
If they had tried out something like this from the start we wouldnt have had an issue. But they didnt, so we had an issue. Its not harder than that. Punitive action just because the CCP people and a small minority dont like umbrellas doesnt work.
---
They killed lowsec, now they are killing themselves. Pottery
---
You are very behind the times.
---
Ofc Vily also offered to buy and Cache structures for 100% of hull value.
---
It’s too late to save the game at this point because of the problem citadels and skill injectors created. Can’t take all the damage they’ve done back. 
---
I just hope when eve dies they do eve classic and we can have a redo.
---
You heard it here gents, I am a boss man. Selling VINDI for 20,000 USD worth of plex, looking at you AOM....
---
Game doesn’t need you. It was created and survived it’s hardest stage already. Old eve didn’t give you the dank loot and rewards you’re use to now.
---
What’s happening is investors and greed. Giving into the care bears = greater profits regardless of the future of the game. It’s simple business which you people exploit very well. You will throw money and give high earners as long as you can brainlessly krab all day. 
---
I say fuck it, Falcon and Hilmar tried their best and that alone makes me happy. Go and krab, own all the space with all the isk. Play it with all the other krabbers and remove pvp completely. All that’s left now is the remains of an infamous HCMMO. 
---
#WhenGamesGetStage4Cancer
---
This is an interesting take. Feel very much like this because the big groups arent really talking from what Ive seen.
---
TIL there is an evetech subreddit.
---
Granted that the OP seems new to the game, wanted to make the steps simpler than uploading a kill to zkill
---
Given what it is, my guess is this is part of the new NPE revamp. This is the kind of thing you would see in a new player experience. Giving away raw isk for log in is a bit weird unless it is to show people the redemption window. 
---
Additionally, if they _are_ going to remove attributes like they have suggested then they will need some kind of replacement for the loss in LP.
---
Who knows, it's sisi. I am seeing a lot of chicken littleing around here as of late. EVE Vegas comes soon. Wait until then otherwise your crys of "CCP is doing nothing" may appear silly. I have seen it before.
---
Wait a minute here. SP belongs to El Jefe. He is king there.
---
Fuck you. This made me snort. Take my upvote.
---
Your not my dad!
---
I mean, we can debate what counters are all day, but your own metrics CLEARLY show it is currently extremely unbalanced. The real problem isn't that CCP is changing it, but HOW they're changing it. They're putting a band-aid on a wound, because if looting like this becomes common enough, people will just stop running Sotiyos at all.
---
  
---
As usual, CCP puts in a feature, doesn't iterate or balance it very well, someone breaks it,  and then they throw out a half-assed change to stop the bleeding. Right now, you are the unfortunately the "collateral damage" of that change, so at best they'll promise they'll fix it for you and then 6 months later give you another half-assed change and call it good.

Gosh I guess Vily finally upped the threats to evicting people in real life?
---
The queen of AOM should marry the king of scalding pass. Not for political reasons but i would like to see those children.

Basically all the dupe glitches don't work on multiplayer servers.
---
I've got a half eaten king size snickers and a firm handshake as my offer
---
A VNI would take about 2 and a bit hours to pay itself off. If you have no local, you have to hope that nobody comes roaming through for 2 whole hours after you buy a new VNI, otherwise you don't make any profit. (VNIs are about 60 million/hour with optimal skills.)
---
Since the VNI was nerfed, the domi, gila, myrm and ishtar are the next best options. Those all cost more and/or make less isk/hour. This means you have to hope nobody comes through for even longer to break even, let alone make enough isk to spend on roaming ships or doctrine assets. We're assuming you buy your sub with RL money and you're not plexing, which would be even harder.
---
Roamers will almost always have the dps to kill any of these subcapital ratting ships, who will have very little chance of getting help. Sure you could have a cloaky tc3 or stratios on grid, or even a recon/blops. That extra character is not making you any isk, and there is not guarantee that you won't be attacked by enough ships to kill both of your chars.  
---
The solution to this is to move to highsec for isk making, or do abyssals. Neither of which provide much content to roamers.
---
The way CCP can improve this, is to buff safety by having local, or buff rewards so that you can make back the cost of your ship more quickly under the greater risk of no local.
---
never not use quafe.
---
It is known.
---
Wait ... that isnt what it is for? Crap.
---
It's the answer I wanted.
---
At least your company talks to the community rather then hiding when issues with the community come up, absolutely sick of Jagex and their radio silence on an issue that's been a sore spot for my community for years.
---
Please enjoy your weekend &lt;3, I promise to upgrade from Alpha status soon
---
……  Don't forget to thank a Goon for clearing out the useless structures up there.
---
Krabs that sometimes pvp are still krabs. If you spend most of your time orbiting a haven and join fleets when a ping goes out (i.e. most of nullsec) then krab be you.
---
Your  average domi ratter can rat for more than 8 hours a week
---
That would be a good argument EXCEPT they keep throwing out the previous work and remaking the same shit 30m-1h block.  This "iteration" is worse than an iteration a few times back, and they're not really accomplishing anything while wasting a ton of dev time.  While they can't seem to spare any dev time for the rest of the game.
---
&gt;CCP is held to ransom by the giant null blocks they created 
---
*and cater to*
---
The perfect concise explanation.
---
i actually eye rolled
---
I mean, if empty promises are hope, I guess?  But after years of that, I need something actual RESULTS or it doesn't matter.
---
It's not the Imperium's fault or responsibility for the changes CCP has made that incentivize doing exactly what the Imperium has done.
---
The Imperium doesn't owe anyone outside the coalition anything. Not fights, not content, not choosing to play in a given way, nothing.
---
If you want someone to forsake their empire and go around marauding, you first. Until then, blame CCP for the slow fade of the game.
---
A bigger part of the problem is people defending low-effort bandaids pretending it's actual work and downplaying disappointment at said low-effort bandaids, when there's nothing else on the table.
---
Well, you got 4 ultra powerful coalitions that basically do most pvp aside from snuffed and other semi large alliances. The 4 are PanFam (best fam), the Imperium (masters of the art of krabbing), Legacy (killboard hoggers), and Winter Co. (Mainly Chinese) these 4 coalitions have a monopoly over southern null and in my opinion PanFam is pretty boring right now with not a lot of purpose to log on for pvp atm. But to answer your question: they exist because of different reasons for example; Pandemic Legion made Horde so they are allied alliances
---
Another 14 yr old kid got shot last night
---
They are having some issues with the 64 bit version of the launcher. This is especially true if you use a Mac. 
---
Click the settings gear and uncheck the 'Run game client as 64 bit application' checkbox and see if that helps.
---
Oh, ok.
---
It's not your fault that noone can grow in null.
---
It's not your fault that you have more wealth than is possible to lose, by interacting with your galaxy.
---
I'm just asking you to have some fun with that shit.
---
Nah, nobody is funding those setups by paying CCp anymore, that's the problem. The big Multibox setups are paying for PLEX every month in isk. No reason to subscribe if somebody else buys Plex for you.
---
its almost like he doesn't run half the sotyios himself/in his group and loots under the same conditions
---
There is still a bug that Incursion runners occasionally get, where remote ewar bonuses don't decycle.
---
something tapi made up cause their slowbrained members can't drag a box to the fleet hangar
---
Moongoo was one of the biggest (only) conflict drivers for lowsec groups. Nothing left to fight for after that.
---
Dev time? What exactly did they deliver this iteration ?
---
Marauders are some of the tankiest ships in the game. Especially if you aren't planning on going anywhere or doing anything besides running a Cyno, you could triple rep or something and probably tank Concord =)
---
No... the point of taking Cynos away from things like Panic Rorqs was to make sure the Cynos die and need to be replaced. And to make CovOps ships useful for more than just observing.
---
Definitely helpful but if you try it in PVE, you're likely to pull a few more packs. Warlocks can banish certain mobs, but mage and hunter have abilities that work the same with a wider variety of targets (Polymorph and Freeze Trap).
---
Or turn over the chat relays to null blocks and have then work like TCUs. It could work with the lore too.
---
The extra communication helps a lot! Thanks for the extra insight
---
man... i kinda wish i had a impersonator salty enough to do this kind of shit...
---
Good luck with things Mokey
---
Maybe they should talk to the folks that actually teach new players, like E-Uni, PHorde, KarmaFleet, etc. and identify what the new players actually need to get into the game.
---
Part of the issue with Eve is you're either going to play it or you're not. It's not a casual game at all. It's not an FPS hardcore game like Rust or Tarkov where even if you don't know the system you know clicking on heads is the way to victory. 
---
To get into Eve, it requires the player to make a concerted effort on their own. The best CCP can do is fast track the player to the reason they started playing in the first place (be it exploring space, fighting other people, or being a part of large wars).
---
Thanks Cyan
---
I thought panic had died good to see you guys back at it
---
Not the real Forsaken Empire
---
The wormhole sites are pretty backwards. The safest and fastest way to make isk is to EITHER kill the regular site like normal, and kill the drifter with a citadel (which everyone agrees needs to be fixed) or to run 3 dreads. There are a lot of problems regarding this. Number 1 is that your home sites are limited and you can only EVER get 2 dreads out and back into your home. 3 is too many mass-wise, and 2 is not good enough to be worth the risk. What this means is that no one runs sites in caps unless it’s a bear hole. The way a bear hole works is you log an alt out in a dread there with 2 buddies and every Thursday night or similar you log in and run all the sites after establishing control. If any new sigs pop you warp off, maybe throw a yolo carrier at it. THIS is mainly what exoo is talking about when he says WH space is safe. You gotta have the context.
---
Now, the reason people don’t usually use caps for their home sites is escalations. The escalations increase your site times by a minimum of double, and reward half the isk. This was a change done years ago when caps were farming an ungodly amount of isk in wormholes. Part of a rework where they added the drifter battleship. This is why if you don’t have that minimum 3 dreads your site time goes up significantly. 
---
I can’t give you many details about my operation or wormhole class, but the MOST our group earns per individual is around 150 mil/hour. And yes, this is high class. A normal day is much closer to 100/hr. You have to keep in mind further that we can only run our sites once or twice a week, because of the way site respawns work.
---
That character doesnt exist?
---
Correct me where I'm going wrong here with this as a solution:
---
If they make it so the loot spawns in a container that is 30km inside the structure, would that not solve the problem? That is to say, while the structure is alive, you cannot get closer than 30km to the loot drop location as the structure model (or invisible bubble) is in the way. Anything cloaked on grid would effectively have to burn 30km to the container in order to loot it.
---
The group running the site could have a DST 200km off grid, align it before they destroy the structure, then warp to the container immediately, beating out the ninja looter who cannot cover the 30km as quickly. A ninja looter 200km off-grid by comparison cannot pre-align without first decloaking (making itself vulnerable), which gives the site-runner DST a clear advantage as it does not waste any time aligning before warping to the container.
---
Basically, as long as the site-runners ensure right before destroying the structure that no DST has decloaked and aligned 200km off-grid (kill it if it does) , they are effectively guaranteed their loot over the ninja looter.
---
Precisely.
---
The size of the map could definitely be trimmed a bit, but the real issue with null resources is that there's no mechanism that results in decay/destruction of those resources over time. Anoms respawn infinitely, moons/PI are static, upkeep on infrastructure is trivial. Wars used to provide a sink for some of those resources but with current mechanics it's much more effective to sit and krab under an ever expanding super umbrella. Fighting's too much of a hassle and there's no incentive, so everyone blues up and nothing happens. If the blocs' militaries had substantial upkeep costs and the space they occupy became less lucrative over time they would be forced to expand to greener pastures or cut back on their defenses and leave themselves open to attack, both of which drive conflict. That's just one idea though.
---
Blocs won't lose the entirety of their space, but it would be done at the constellation level. Most constellations have 5-8 systems. This would simply be halved.   
---
How would assets be moved? Not my call, I'm giving out what I see as a problem and what I see as the overall solution. Not every detail. Possibly, existing structures would be able to be setup within the original constellation.  
---
As far as big players blue eachother, I see this unlikely simply because of increased scarcity.
---
They did this same shit like 2 years ago with a mass uproar from the players...then made a post and followed through for like 2 months and then this shit again
---
I like that idea too, but everyone is simply too far away. Roam gangs need to be a realistic thing again and this would be possible if people were 10-15 jumps/1 bridge away and not 30+ jump or 3 bridges.
---
I get that part. And that it means you have essentially zero risk in that situation. 
---
But I saw someone posting some numbers, WHs 12t vs NS 17t. Thats, by your own words, a couple of procent of the playerbase making around 70% of what perhaps 40-50% of the playerbase is making. And they do it in space in which they control entries/exits.
---
Thats ridiculous. Especially when this high isk/capita group is pressuring for more risk for the group that makes less. I mean, theres no way around this, the numbers are there. WHs are making a shitton more isk/capita than in NS while having the option to essentially turn off gates. 
---
Sure it requires work but you can pretty much lock down a system while you are farming right? And you do have a bigger headstart than we do if someone knocks on the door, right?
---
This is what the issue is. Balance cuts all ways, not just one. NS has been constantly nerfed for years because of faucets then we hear that the part of space that holds a couple of procent of the playerbase is making nearly as much as the rest of us in high safety conditions are trying to push for more NS nerfs so they can get easier kills?
---
I mean, put yourself in our shoes. Does this seem sane? Why would we accept more nerfs to us before you guys get some nerfs? Especially since you guys have honestly exploited things, like the astra thing and the FoF missiles or the perfect tracking thing or the HIC rolling (dont remember fully).
---
Honestly, I see lots more shit coming from group than ours, yet we get much more shit simply because you guys are "small" gang and some belive that to be the best way to play the game. When in fact its NS that keeps the lights on, that attracts players with wars and big battles and in fact retains more players than any other group.
---
What these last couple of months have done is straight up started a civil war between the player groups and I dont think you guys can win this. You were all in when it came to burn NS but the only thing that happened is that you guys basically publically made yourselves our enemies. And now you have more and more wanting to see your playstyle diminished. 
---
You guys should have backed us, quite frankly. You guys knew these changes were bad yet everyone still wanted them. This would always be the result unless CCP wanted the game to die. Now we all have to live in the mess that honestly was cheered on by your group. 
---
This is what I wanted the least.
---
&gt;can't counter this
---
[citation needed]
---
He's over there.  \*points to the single, Party of Chinese Communists, member\*
---
Cool thanks!
---
I repeat.  CCP is bad at this.
---
Gonna be honest with you, I agree that we could do more with less space. But if you push NS too hard, blocs will just start working together instead. We dont need to fight, like at all, we can just do things WH style, have predetermined battles just for the fights and have economic ties that ensure everyone gets a piece of the pie.
---
they either need cap or cap charges for that tank to run.  No they could not tank concord way overstated, I don't see a problem with it.  It is counterable in every way.
---
At least an answer - any answer - would show some effort. Which is, while not much, still more than nothing at all.
---
That looks like it is gonna cost SO much money lol.
---
I'm starting a discussion. I'm not here to say I have the exact answer. Structures blow up hourly now and shit is moved around across regions and between regions instantly without a thought.  
---
Discussions start the process.
---
Of course it's fixable, but I do agree on making the game better.
---
I'd like to see the t1 cyno move from black ops to a all t1 battleship hulls and/or marauder.
---
Agreed.
---
Maybe instead of reducing systems, more &amp; longer gates could be added.  That would at least "shrink" the galaxy in terms of travel time but yeah something needs to happen with the geography.
---
Not every highsec miner is running an AFK orca squad. There are players out there who live in highsec, like to mine, and do other things too. I've also known players who lived in highsec and felt very protective of "their" space, and would fight to defend their system.
---
[removed]
---
Orange, who would have guessed.
---
This is hardly a new idea, or "starting" a "discussion." You're being fucking lazy about not actually putting effort into the idea of deleting systems. You just wrote a bunch more words than you had to, made up some arbitrary numbers, and are asking others to do the actual effort part
---
I hope it's one per account so the injector farmers can crash the market
---
Cool, good feedback!
---
Thanks! It took a bit more congitive effort than your OP did, but I'm sure you can get there!
---
Ah, the good old days...
---
you loot faster than him, really isn't rocket science buddy
---
&gt;I no longer want to take any risky fights because it's simply always a loss and I lose five times the amount of isk I used to lose per loss compares to the old days.
---
This seems like you problem.
---
Are you telling us that since the "old days" you've never taken the time to improve your isk generation?
---
&gt;Wish I could go back in time to 2006 - 2011 and experience FUN eve again, where you could roam in a piece of shit and fight other pieces of shit and you all die in a fire and it was a laff and made friends along the way.
---
What does this have to do with your opening point about "artificially inflated prices"? 
---
You just sound salty for the sake of being salty.
---
Not when your brain smooth you cant.
---
Y'all just released the Triglavian invasion content and some whingers are saying it's maintenance mode.  
---
That's pretty much a free pass to hit the snooze button.
---
Please tell one of the clades that they need to fuck up FW next.
---
why do you expect someone to prove a negative? its up to you nerds to prove he is scripting in the first place.
---
&gt;supposedly has some unbeatable loot method
---
if only it wasn't unbeatable and certain groups actually managed to beat him without some script hmmmm
---
Reset everyone, go around the map and create absolute blue donut
---
No actual assets have \*inflated\* for years. By in large everything has gotten cheaper.
---
&gt;This idea isn't particularly well thought out
---
About the only thing we can all agree on.
---
This is the real problem. The PvE is unimaginative,  unengaging, and tedious. So when I loose a ship, I'm losing real money. Makes me think twice about which fights to take.
---
I see you're a relatively new player who hasn't been around that long, hit me up if you need an advice.
---
How about instead leaving the big blob groups?
---
Will do, maybe we can get a party going ))
---
I get it EVE is not fun sometimes. I just have not found another game that can deliver the highs that EVE can.  So for my money ill be here till there is another game that can deliver what EVE does.  Quietly crossing my fingers for Dual Universe.
---
It's because the tempo of conflict is low, and what is being fought over is less important, valued or tangible than the intended instruments.
---
Listen fella the simple answer is FUCK YOU. If you dont like what TAPI is doing then come do something about it.  Otherwise sit here and foam at the mouth.  Either way nobody gives two shits how you feel or the judgement you cast in your wildly uneducated opinions.
---
Why can't they make it like every other MMO out there and use random drop(s) for players who participate? I know I have shied away from big blob fights because every time I was in one I was unable to loot squat. Players who participate x amount have a chance of getting the big drop. You can even have a skill tied to it and say you hack electronically a bpc computer and steal the BPC to keep it to theme. 
---
Regular salvage can still drop via wrecks.
---
And then we should all take our ships to his favorite system and sacrifice ourselves to him too. He still wouldn't be happy.
---
and instead of fixing it, CCP just tries to make it even MORE tedious, and then revamps the NPE for the 4932104828402th time.  Gee, I wonder why numbers keep dropping...
---
t2 is expensive because its not an afk resource income anymore,  which has made t3s cheaper than t2 ships lmao
---
Ive run over 40 not 2/3
---
Who are you, why are you in my sanctum
---
Cookie clicker is the best way I can describe Cartier ratting.
---
And as I said iv run maybe two thirds of that many. Reading comprehension level 1 instead of scripting level 5
---
Was 250m when I started.
---
and get smashed by 4 faction frigates that warp in to curb stomp your T1. 
---
You cant really learn much even in FW anymore. people always bring overkill.
---
PBUH
---
This is more of the "I'm rubber your glue" defense you're so fond of.
---
That's not artificial inflation. That's normal inflation.
---
But also it's odd that some things have gone so up in price and others haven't (orcas and freighters for example)
---
That's the only thing though.
---
Haha. Dont worry there is an exciting new project coming up about Vampric Capsuleers who run around stations with guns to be announced soon :)
---
So ...nothing? Better repost this dick of Hilmars and call it a release!
---
It's also rose-colored glasses.
---
His experience with EVE then didn't have so much to do with differences in the game between now and then, but differences in his own mentality.
---
Only the blops skill matters.
---
And the bomber not having their prop mod on.
---
UwU
---
He had an empty mid and no rigs
---
Depends on what timeframe you're looking at, when I first flew an Orca it was 300m on market... In like 2011 lmao
---
You mean you're depressed by the CCP Propaganda show?
---
Before resource changes?
---
In 2013 they were already over 700 and freighters were over 1b.
---
Pretty sure there were changes to the materials before that.
---
This is not the real problem. The PvE has been unimaginative, unengaging and tedious for 16 years. CCP poured tons of dev time into FOBs and abyssal space, both have been min/maxed and are just as tedious as everything else now. Any attempt at team based PVE drives people to run it with alts. It's a waste of time.
---
If they want to improve the current situation they could start by balancing the fucking game. Adding more overpowered stuff to offset other overpowered stuff isn't balancing, it just leaves everything else further behind. But whatever. Bring out the Trig dread. At least that'll sell some injectors.
---
We dying boiz!
---
There was that strange bug where entire constellations would change sovereignty overnight and almost exactly at the reset time which calculated pos ownership to determine sovereignty. Strange, CCP was never able to quite figure out how BoB did that 😕
---
Cause theft and scamming has always been a part of eve and that shouldnt change
---
I like this, clear benefit to runners while still maintaining a chance of theft if they are idiots
---
What does this even mean?
---
That's a bit rich coming from a person hiding behind an alias.
---
Upvoted for Phobos usage, long live hicbros.

---
Well if any of you come through provi and wanna pew I'm happy to give you a good fight. Just gimme a mail if im on or something. Pretty much same with any other fc's.
---
This show went to shit long ago, just a propaganda.
---
Yes, that's right. Around 2009?
---
Yes and you've called horde on multiple occasions so crying about a batphone for a faction forti is rich coming from you (Tbh I only learnt that we had called initiative like a few hours before fleet)
---
I do suppose it is pretty unsafe to stay decloaked :thinking:
---
I'd like to delete t1 cyno modules and have deployable structure act as the beacon.
---
You get one per attendee. They are handed out as cards with a redeemable code.
---
and by "elite pvp" u mean keeping the loot safe for the blob blocks as the "elite escalation of a few lowsec/wh bois will never outmatch the "elite titan blob" of a 00 pleb pile.
---
idk dude
---
it really just favours the n+1 again rather than allowing a skilled player do anything.
---
I think I'd masturbate to his resignation post tbh.
---
&gt;Corps are more like states/provinces/whatever.
---
All your wall of text is build upon that belief, but it is wrong. There are no totally independent states/provinces/whatever they are always part of a bigger entity, but corps could be totally independent.
---
Won eve a couple years ago, isn't the main aim of a roaming gang still to be faxed to your home station?
---
If the game dies, it dies with the Imperium at the top of the heap.
---
If you want the game to be healthy, make CCP change it. 
---
***The Imperium owes you nothing; neither content, nor self-imposed handicap, nor sacrifices "for the good of the game".***
---
Not safe for wormholes
---
thats when you learn ab dscan
---
Wow... please don’t post again... ever
---
The benefit would be../. Giving use to the undock button
---
I think the intention is that you are not supposed to have that level of free intel in a WH.
---
You don't, but then you make less isk, which over time means it is less of a problem.
---
300m is my first memory. 2010 perhaps.  
---
now you get 1.75B for every 500 plex you sell.
---
so unless everything else went up by 600%, prices of "stuff" have dropped.
---
It's just a hosting provider. No need to play eve from a datacenter, so the entire range would be blocked.
---
&gt;As I am sure you and your comrades at CCP are aware, the community is currently in a state of, upheaval shall we say.
---
There isn't even a sticky with the major issues yet. We are not angry enough.
---
“Eve team is currently growing” lmao as if it could go any leaner after the massive cuts from last year.
---
Yep this too ... imagine yourself if you need to pickup the wreck from the site, haul it to station and use those components to rebuild the ship.
---
Well I should say Pritty Much all t2 components in high sec would be non existent and only really around in null sec
---
Hi Chicka
---
depends what high slots the rorq is running.  many prefer to run smartbombs &gt; heavy neuts.
---
The sun finally set on the poco empire
---
My corp ran scout and escort for freighters from Deklein to Lonetrek in 2007, you can do it.
---
Once you mix the voice of Trump and the writing of Kendarr, you will always have fun (in your head) in our alliance.
---
if only we could get skins like this instead of the boring looking ones for fucking 600plex...
---
You spent blackout screeching instead of putting forward suggestions on what you wanted. Now it’s gone you imply you’d have accepted it subject to a ‘few tweaks’ 
---
Bullderdash
---
And move a freighter into hostile territory, so only really viabke by titan bridging a freighter around
---
Laborious, lol, and we had to have warp to 0km bookmarks for both ways.
---
But you are wrong, a JF pilot and all their alts, because apparently they don’t trust corp mates, jumping themselves around risk free is anti-content.
---
Forming a fleet to escort a slow defenseless cargo ship, or forming a fleet to kill the slow defenseless cargo ship is content.
---
Or trying to kill the stuff being escorted.
---
Fine a testy, enjoy your blues!
---
Said it was a terrible idea rather than invalid, my personal opinion on the matter is that it would inevitably stifle content rather than encourage it.
---
But that is my opinion, you are entitled to your own :)
---
Similar mindset to CCP and login numbers during the last batch of changes
---
With a CCP response answering it? Ok.
---
Because shitting in the sandbox it just being "innovative". Doesn't matter if your intention is to ruin it for everyone else.
---
Think back to when they gave sp farms Concord ships 🤔🤔
---
I'm pretty sure you have to sign a physical contract when you become a CSM
---
And there WILL be NDA restrictions in that one
---
Are there wormholes with statics into shattered wormholes?
---
Breaking into software is illegal
---
But you are not breaking into eves code of you have s third party software that presses F1 and Orbit using screen recognition and your mouse cursor
---
I have 3 buttons on my mouse that are wired to 1, 2 and 3 on the keyboard to activate slots 1, 2 and 3 using the mouse driver
---
For the attacker yes, for the defender it’s a negative burden.
---
I have really found memories of when PL first formed and escorted freighters from Curse to Fountain. 
---
Sadly that would be asking for a random doomsday these days, and I think that with the cyno changes JF pilots have it hard enough, especially those in smaller groups. 
---
But I can’t fly JFs so I’m going to upvote your post anyway.
---
Another painfully boring patch.
---
So you want PVE to be turbo syphilis aids with bonus no local instead of just aids? Most of those changes would be maybe ok with local. You do all that and remove local and the krabs won't hang around waiting for local to come back, they'll straight up just leave forever.
---
I heard that as of last patch a glitch was fixed where alpha accounts could log in side-by-die on the same machine if the character portraits were clicked one after the other with a 6 second period of time - against the EULA and allows one PC to have upwards of 4 or 5 or more alphas logged in at the same time.. fixed now apparently.
---
Nah its still making bank dont worry :')
---
Agreed, Between Vegas and London, Those are the last 2 events this year, And the last chance for something major to be announced, But if CCP show nothing of value then it will be time to move on.
---
Here's the thing. You won't get a thing from falcon. He either responds to positives or casual questions. There is rarely, if ever, any communication from CCP at all regarding bad stuff happening all round the game. It would be funny, if it wasn't so sad. Falcon is supposed to be a **senior community manager**. Community manager is supposed to talk with the community. But most of what we get from him is on posts regarding patches, trying to defend them, and when someone praises CCP. It's pretty much the same on forums, except with worse UI (which is an accomplishment).
---
So, yeah. Don't expect much from a company that killed 90% of its community team.
---
&gt; lmao, you honestly believe that? that apparently we somehow dictate what changes are and aren't made to the game?
---
Nullblobs literally just went on strike until CCP reverted a change
---
if they havent them blued already
---
Only time that you'll see a freighter being escorted by a big escort fleet will be mayor anchoring ops. TEST brought full BS fleet when we were protecting a freighter with previous payload. Now you can see it on Jita Gate in Perimeter.
---
As for null, same thing applies, you need to escort DST into system, anchor the structure, and then you can use it for logistics.
---
Also, without JF forward deployments would be much more of PITA. Of course you can substitute it with bridging DSTs via Blops but it's very much nothing as efficient, and much more of a bother.
---
In short, don't punish logi people, they already have in hard, and without them it would be much harder for everyone to have fun.
---
Is that the reason you can attack the police?
---
this is fucking stupid, you obviously have to "make" isk somehow and doing so you have 2 options, industry/PVE or buying plex. Obviously you seem to have an issue with how much inflation easier PVE has caused so you must be buying plex??? Plex has inflated in value wayyyyy more than ships and fittings have so idk why you'd be upset at that. Your argument doesn't make sense.
---
People need to actually walk through their idea's before posting, and show they have actually considered at least in part what their proposed change would actually do to the game.
---
Old school runescape or?
---
i mean it really matters cause if its not Old school i wont attend matthew.
---
No, this will be a huge step back.
---
Whaaaat?
---
Was just a random thought, but do you care to elaborate on how you think it would be a step back ?
---
So you're saying there is a box of codes somewhere?
---
Initially all basic items were sold by NPC and ore was bought by them.       
---
Over the time CCP moved all industry into player hands.
---
Not true though.
---
The npc bounties dropped, but nullsec combat losses were the same. Even despite the Exodus of Krabs
---
near2 simply reads game logs of the intel channels of your choosing. if they remove that ability then it’s bye bye zkill, dotlan, and any other data pulling site or app. id be more then fine with that, just remember that intel channels will still work. so would mumble team speak and discord
---
I unironically don't know what you're talking about. Panfam left the north? Where'd they go? Been out of the loop lately.
---
It's still a start.
---
But also, everything else you mention is no different from now.
---
&gt; perfect intel on who is ratting where,
---
No they don't. No tool tells you who is where or what they are doing.
---
The map provides some mildly delayed info about some things in regard to what is happening in a system, but not who is doing it.
---
I’m sorry, Trigger who?
---
You're obviously a sock puppet.
---
No. 
---
/thread
---
Good idea
---
The fact that you "think that ship has sailed" is meaningless.
---
More shit iterations on a shit mechanic just makes more shit.
---
Or the attached won't bother since once they leave another would pop up
---
Oh yes I remember the last time goonswarm fought all of EVE
---
That would be a single cycle filling the orca...
---
Quietly this time. Just make it more and more unreliable.
---
&gt; I thought you PVPers liked to kill each other? Isn't that the idea of PVP.
---
Through the entire of eve's history it's been a constant that people who love pvp, avoid others who do as much as possible.
---
lol so against a guy who’s trying to counter your play, instead of adapting like he did you come to r/eve and beg that his way of dealing with you is removed from game. hold on i can shit post too.
---
Qol change: all velocity mods should have there speed cut by 75% and point range by 50%
---
(disclaimer don’t actually want that, just trying to slowly open the eyes of a shitposter)
---
I think you mean deflated?
---
The character I was linking from also lost a myrm to 2 cynabals and a stiletto next . Dodged them 3 times and finally got caught with one repper running. The local rage when the mjd fires and you warp out is next level.
---
I hope you know that most of the eve community is not feeling this doom and gloom.. This sub is just notorious for collecting a bunch of disgruntled reeee people.
---
More doom and gloom. Smh
---
Watch streams occasionally (maybe while roaming yourself) and talk to the streamer. Ask about engagements that happen, mistakes on either side etc. 
---
In the meantime, fly cheap ships, i.e. t1 up to BC. T1 destroyers will probably provide the most fun content per ISK for starters.
---
They said it in another thread- they are hard at work retaining new players. That is their core focus. No developer or community rep is out here saying what they are doing to further engage existing players to the game (outside of halfbaked pve that only a handful of folks do).
---
As a new player of about a week I’m noticing this quickly. Not gonna lie it doesn’t want to make ya stick around.
---
Honestly I don't recall the numbers off the top of my head, but given there was a "war" I would expect numbers to be roughly the same, and inflated
---
Not in this case
---
Probably for the best.
---
You do seem like the type that would enjoy if everyone that PVPed quit.
---
Yeah the current new player experience isn't very good, but CCP's working on it.
---
Agency drugs you have now in DED store
---
Just shut up and play it. Don't "wait for the next big update". Why? Just fucking log on, build a ship, undock, and play. You fucking baby
---
But most of nullsec also complained that black out and the drifters ended the wars.
---
It's in the title.
---
You do realize this is not official support you're talking to? Quit being a whiny little baby, submit a ticket via https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us and expect an answer. The fact that you got a rare error does not make the community crazy.
---
You would be killing an entire playstyle for beginner industry pilots. Those just starting out building would need to invest a significant amount of time training to build T2 items.
---
Finding a niche item to sell on the market can be a good step up for those starting out, or just those industry orientated players who spot a gap in the market. Particularly with items that don't have T2 variants, like stand-up ammo.
---
Having played since 2005 the game has definitely evolved but I still find it fun for an established player. I wouldn’t want to be a new player at this point, in my opinion they need to make high sec safe for miners again. That would send all the carebears back to high sec and make the giant null sec corps less able to support their massive holdings, which would hopefully return the game to more fluid smaller corps holding smaller areas having more fleet battles. The only people that wouldn’t like this are the griefers who are a big part of why I wouldn’t want to be a new player now. I’ve introduced many people to the game but for the last several years none have stayed and they all say it’s due to people picking at them in high sec when they are still trying to learn the game.
---
hear me out, it's almost like having alts maybe shouldn't have been allowed to begin with
---
Wormhole space is pretty alright. Everyone else (including CCP) hates us, but that's nothing new.
---
And this is how a new Legacy Pet was Born
---
Haha, I’m not familiar with fxr but sounds like fun.
---
In some sense, he's not wrong, even if he's a bit breathless. We've had venezuelan levels of inflation (yeah, I know it's an exaggeration) the last five years or more. when I started, a PLEX (converted to today's 1/500th plex) would come out to about 500K. cruisers were 15-20 mil leaving the station and Battleships weren't nearly as expensive, meaning scrubs like me used them more.
---
Mostly what changed is CCP made high quality PVE easier and more available and made it easy to have bots running anoms (they didn't spawn reliably in the past), incursions, explo changes, etc.
---
What this means to users who have less time for the game is the grind for ISK to buy replacements has become a larger percentage of in game time. It's mainly a problem for casuals than it is for no lifers so it might go unnoticed.
---
Thankfully, I have enough OOG income that I can drop a couple jacksons or a bill here and there but I recognize there are guys who can't, especially in developing economies.
---
PVE needs a complete revamp. CCP should also think about undoing some of the nerfs to T1 BS and BC over the years. Not only are they comparatively expensive but they have less utility. I would love to be in a game where every scrub wasn't tooling around in a kiki or bomber gang.
---
What are you? A socialist?
---
Lol the only posts allowed on this sub is crying about the game
---
&gt; low sec is dead
---
GEEEEEE. I wonder how that happened!
---
I remember that kill :)
---
So, the mentality of I had to slug through so should you is a massive turn off to new players. Right now they dont stand a chance to fight back against you. So effectively you want to seal club new people.
---
We also had NPC controlled trade routes. Used to be actual corps of trade runners where today, traders are almost always solo.
---
I hate to say it but I kinda agree. Eve Vegas is make or break. I hope they have something really big and fantastic planned, at the very least demonstrating they know where they are trying to go.
---
Awesome work, thank you very much for making this long standing dream possible :)
---
Just remember 80% of there development team are now dedicated solely to the NPE.  With the left over set for everything else.  There will not be a new glass ceiling expansion for a very long time.  Expect trig capitals announced at eve Vegas in a teaser with eve London being the end all be all defacto information with another blackout and expanded trig invasions to null.
---
Lol I remember being dropped by supers and carriers in 2010. Or massive lag fights that were always won by the players with the best connection. I remember 300 players on grid crashing the node.
---
I cant tell if youre the fake one anymore lol
---
The problem is that it is amazing game ... and every one know the issues.     
---
But CCP don't care
---
It's pets all the way down now. The petception, if you will.
---
It's still the best NPE it has ever been. A lot better than when I just spawned in space next to a rock and a rat and had to figure out the controls while getting shot.
---
Only if you pay for isk. If you are earning it in game the same income doesn’t go as far.
---
Having to wait any period of time to actually play the game is utterly shit, even if it's `only a few months`. Heck most games I don't even play for more than a month or two. Skill injectors aren't any better though, it's just crappy mobile game economy nonsense. I'd rather just be given the skills to fly a decent T2 fit atron/rifter/merlin/tormentor on day one.
---
Right now you kinda do get that in the form of the recruit a friend SP reward but that should just be a default thing, and knowing what to actually invest those SP into to have a decent ship is pretty much impossible, so it ends up being more useful for vets/botters creating a new alt once they've already min/maxed a skillplan for it.
---
Your computer is broke yo
---
Maybe try turning it off and on again? :o
---
New players, even if they stay, stay for short period of time at most, because after some time, they'll just discover how shit mid-to late game pve/game is.
---
&gt; Maybe your playstyle is nerfed but that happens in every game.
---
Problem begins when 80% of playstyles are nerfed.
---
Hallowed be His name
---
I would argue that currently there is enough content if you're flying a frigate, but absolutely zero to do anywhere between that and a super/titan/rorq - and of course a supercap is much more appealing to newbies than a rifter so they mostly just ignore lowsec frig pvp and get stuck in a grind that they quickly get bored of.
---
&gt; ''we better not engage, they look about even to us''
---
You're just playing with the wrong people.
---
Just be glad that they're not dread rats dropping on your orca .-.
---
Always been dead, and never undying.  RK is the thesis of its own antithesis, ad infinitum.
---
The loser always has opinions on what the winner ought to do with his success. If you want to be heard, adopt a tone of reverence like a good supplicant. You went from derisive to demanding without kneeling to kiss the ring.
---
Most changes that retain new players obviously won’t retain veterans. Newer players want quicker access to action and less waiting around. They also don’t want to join a game and think “2 years, just 2 years and I’ll be able to do that tho g I THINK I wanna do, but then get 100mil SP in and realize that isn’t what I wanna do....” So we have skill injectors, which vets hate more than they love them. The better solution would be to start players off with better footing... just to have vets upset that they had to earn that same SP. Then you’ll have the vets that exploit it somehow, and get mad when the exploit removes “the way I play the game!”
---
Bitter vets control this sub, and like to think they control how the game is bent to their whims. The reality is, their toxic nature here and elsewhere isn’t encouraging newbros to stay, and the retention of new players is the future. You want a game to play? Help come up with solutions instead of pushing away new players. You may get the Eve you want, but it may not exist in that state much longer.
---
A section of space with faster gameplay entry, a newbro experience that puts them in multiple end-game activity previews, and a greater transparency from CCP. That last one is something we don’t have because of the pure vitriol spewed at CCP anytime they try to do anything.
---
Vets: “Do something!”
---
... “NOT THAT!
---
“Talk to us!”
---
... “Hello?”
---
“CCP doesn’t listen, they don’t do anything.”
---
They’re afraid to make changes, the. They make big changes and players crucify them for it. You can’t always predict what will make the game better... but you have to give them some room to try.
---
In 2 days I'll be flying mine... Can't wait 🤩
---
I literally think that’s actually best for everyone.  But you apparently
---
I usually get more and more desperate the longer it's been since the last kill and I start going for anything that moves
---
You sound like a grandfather reminiscing how good it was when you were young, go out with 2 bob have a great night and still have enough for the buss fare home.
---
There are three real draws to Eve that CCP would do well to foster:
---
* PVP that gives players the shakes (small-mid size fights)
---
* The economy simulator (market players, industrialists)
---
* Large scale war (like or not many players are happy to anchor and F1)
---
There are other draws such as politics, scamming, etc. that CCP is best to keep their hands off of. Instead of seriously fostering the above items, they've focused almost entirely on PVE for new and old players (NPE, Abyssal space, new incursions). They also fired their economist. PVE is purely a means to an end. It is not engaging the same way as PVE is in other games as Eve is a more hands off game. Admittedly they seem to be trying to address large scale war but the playerbase has probably ruined that for good. Blackout addressed item 1 but it severely impacted item 2 and the means for nullsec players to support item 3.
---
There's no money to fix the game.
---
There's little wiggle room in client due to legacy code to make big changes without reinventing the wheel.
---
The amount of botting has seemingly gotten to the point where it makes so much real life revenue for CCP that they look the other way as often as possible. 
---
We should be asking for the next game. This ones probably ready for pasture.
---
God I wished Data and Relic sites still had rats in them. That would have killed a load of the Relic/Astero bots roaming in null.
---
JFs do provide content. They are space trucks. They move shit from A to B to support player activity.
---
Without them actively will slow due to lack of material.
---
Stuff...can i has?
---
Dont need nat if you have your own block of ips. Then everything would be routed publicly.
---
bring back crimson havest 2015 edition pls
---
&gt;It's not a data center, it's a vps with a few ip's on it, and yes that can safely change everyday for a year without even rebooting the host no problem. Again most of these hosts aren't even big enough to manage their own asn. 
---
Where is the VPS located? On a server in a DC somewhere, which is owned by a hosting provider. This provider has an ISP, or effectively is an ISP and has its own IP range directly from RIPE. All of this can be blocked.
---
&gt;Ccp doesn't need to fix the world's problems, they need to let people fix their own problems however.
---
So if a country doesn't allow people to connect to EVE, CCP should not compensate for that.
---
&gt;Most isp's already give a second ip address to most home customers, you needn't VPN at all when you can just dmz a system onto a different range than your main. 
---
And what do you think happens when someone wants to run 200 bots from these two addresses? Do you think CCP has the ability to notice this?
---
&gt;It's dumb to ban for TOR it just creates more maintenance for your overworked front line already and doesn't solve any problems.
---
Zero problems here. Just tell people they have to use their real ISP. You dont want to, you dont connect.
---
I agree that that progress before injectors was too slow. I like the removal of injectors, but to help new players catch up faster CCP should let skill levels  effect only the ability to use certain ships/modules but doesn't effect the efficiency of them (basically no ship/module bonus per skill levels). I always found "unrealistic" that you can do more damage and shoot further because you have more SP.
---
This way new players could be competitive even in the first months in small ships, retaining them would be easier.
---
Are you saying this free intel should remain in game despite it now being known?
---
Jump freighters didnt even exist for a really long time
---
That drop in null activity due to the black out brought a lot of people back to the game.
---
Maybe little challenges to help newbros get more sp. Kinda like the skilling spree. But we don't want people getting skills took quickly either or the game in general would be a bit fucked.
---
Its the best change that can never happen. If it had been this way from the start it would be totally different.
---
Don't ask in here - toxic....
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
They dont provide content. No one loses a JF unless they are incompetent. If people had to fly freighters through gates then there would be content.
---
 Dont listen to the lamentations of the Reddit 'eve is dying' crowd, as they drown in their salty tears. Eve is still beautiful, dynamic, and engaging. Join back in and find your nitch. Blow stuff up.
---
I'm going to take a wild guess here, but you really didn't think this one through, eh.
---
All the data says CPI has stayed pretty much constant since 2011, when the drone poo rework was announced.
---
Ships are more expensive because players want to make them more expensive. Geddon hulls have not been 60 mil for 7 years. But a Geddon from 2012 costs pretty much the same that it does now.
---
I have donated every corpse I have captured to the drifters Praise bob
---
The environments are rendering just fine for the rest of us though :p
---
Only CCP can solve these problems. Unfortunately, only they have knowledge of what resources and time is worth investing in. Ideas are easy, but implementation is difficult. Compound that with any change being met with opposition... and you have a situation of trying to satisfy too many variables.
---
A Chinese Wall setup between CCP’s Business and Development sides doesn’t work, because they are too closely intertwined. They can’t just make a business decision and let devs figure out how to make it work. Nor can they do something to appease one player group without thought for the financial implications. The closest they’ve come? The Alpha/F2P model has created 2 groups with separate goals for CCP and divided revenue streams to an extent. Keeping older players and newer players separated seems like the only way they can afford to develop a new player experience. Carve out a section of space somehow with different fast-paced gameplay and leave the old guard to what they love. The problem there... is the sandbox. Honestly, I think gameplay is going to change to entice the MOBA/BR/FPS players that get more instant-gratification. This means losing the veterans that don’t want to let go of their comfort zone. Which they scream about anytime a change is made.
---
What is most likely to happen:
---
CCP will try to squeeze income out of Eve as long as they can while developing a new game. Then establishing a revenue stream that will allow them to scale-back or close Eve. Unless said game blows up and enables them to continue supporting Eve.
---
If that new game is Eve2, Eve-like or more toward the popular meta... remains to be seen.
---
Personally, and this hurts to say, I don’t think CCP can make it work. Their inability to innovate in Eve with measurable gains has me doubtful of their ability to create a new IP/game. Not anything groundbreaking and a major income stream, at least.
---
I hope I’m wrong, I really do.
---
Other game companies create new games and IP, or at least develop another creators IP. The ones that don’t, stagnate while trying to squeeze everything they can out of one game until they fold. I love Eve, the idea, the aesthetic and the vibe that CCP has at its core. I’ll take all of that in a different gameplay format, I will. If it means Eve instead of no Eve... then that seems a simple choice.
---
You kill the rats and scoop their tags?
---
Isk/hour will be adjusted up accordingly.
---
Providing the meterial to make things that do things is at worst providing indirect content.
---
What do you think is jumping in 150,000,000,000 ISK loads from Jita to 1DQ1-A is doing? It's providing the alliance with caca to make internet space ships. These space ships may or may not provide content. But that's not my business as a JFer.
---
&gt;Makes it look worse than it is.
---
Not really, before ferrogel duping was fixed a hac was like 50-60m. Ferrogel duping getting fixed plus the lifeblood expansion drove the price of the same hac up by a lot.
---
The price of Plex in 2008 was something on the order of 3-500m and the cost of a hac was about 5-60m.
---
Today 500 Plex cost 1.7b and the average hac is 250m
---
Plex has increased by 240% while the cost of an unfit hac has increased by 310%.
---
His real complaint seems to be that command ship/hac/trig doctrines have power creeped the base line level needed to be competitive to the point where t1 doctrines are useless. That combined with the increased cost of those doctrines has made a casual play style harder to achieve.
---
I think Drifters are forgotten by now
---
For real. Is Eve the first MMO in the world to be solely populated by grumpy old men?
---
I hope you have as much fun with it as I have!
---
Hell naw. Do you have any idea how hard we worked to get those bears to leave? Eve doesn't need new players, it needs good players.
---
Theran tried to ref a fort today...[this](https://imgur.com/a/OLJE5b7) was the resulting smack talk
---
People who don't understand them do.
---
You noticed!
---
I am confused. Mineral prices have crashed since excavators were introduced. Minerals are not inflating.
---
If everyone is fighting in 800m T3s and trig shit doesn’t that entirely disprove your point about “EVE is dying because T1 cruisers cost more”? Everyone else can obviously afford these things. You’re just spacepoor. Frankly 800m is hardly any ISK.
---
Also the ISK supply has changed drastically. A cruiser is 30m, sure, but people have way more ISK floating around than they used to. Super ratting, boson ratting, etc. So the fact that you don’t have the ISK to comfortably  whelp a T1 cruiser is sad. And that ‘FC’? He’s just a pussy. 2013 had those too.

This post is like an old baby boomer reminiscing  about how 5 cents could buy you a whole bag of chips when they were a kid.
---
&gt; Removing injectors would be the best thing maybe not from a business stand point
---
That's why it will never happen. Just.. stop trying, it is too much of a cash cow for CCP to let go.
---
its far quicker and comfortable to drag drop than switching to discord and typing
---
&gt; Why don't you send a ticket instead of excrementing on reddit? Nobody here cares about what you do.

risk adverse much? ah you wormhole folk prefer the bounty of solo vnis! bravo for avoiding any confrontation, roll that hole and find more suitable less toothy content!

The screenshot was taken in 4K, so feel free to just download and use as is :D. Your OS will automatically downscale it if needed.

&gt; Just shut up and play it. Don't "wait for the next big update". Why? Just fucking log on, build a ship, undock, and play. You fucking baby
---
You sound like a boomer telling a depressed youngster to "just stop being depressed and go outside".
---
This comment has no substance. No specific criticism, no supportive argument behind it's conclusions. You're just whining.
---
From my observation content for many in Eve is when you win 😂
---
My theory, and I kinda believe it, is that the AT was abandoned due to not enough dev time.  If you think about it, the reward ships do need to be designed and get a balance pass. I can't help but think that if they don't have the time for AT what else are they abandoning?  And it scares me.  I actually really try not to think about it.
---
Who?
---
It would also kill more accounts than Blackout and Cyno changes combined.
---
Blood raider faction stuff but yes.
---
I've been playing the game since '03, and yes prices have inflated, but show me a single MMO where they haven't.  Its what happens in games with not enough currency sinks and too many ways to make in game currency.
---
You are an idiot ha ha-ha-ha-ha-haaa ha-ha-ha-ha haaa-haaa
---
Man, the abyss always looks so much cooler than anywhere else in Eve.
---
...though I guess wormholes now look and sound pretty cool too.
---
Iceland has an orange fettish
---
What you say rings very true - a dev downsizing event (to cut costs) will definitely create a signal that the game is in maintenance mode.
---
Okey so I think everyone needs to just take a deep breath. I certainly get and share others frustration regarding CCP basically just letting the game go for a long time and now they managed to piss pretty much everyone off in just a couple of months. CCP, this happens when you put your dick on the table.
---
I fully agree we should keep the rage going because that seems to be the only thing working to get CCP to actually fking notice that we want real changes instead of the BS they think we should accept.
---
But, at the same time we actually need to give them some time. We are asking for good changes, that takes time, more than a month or 2 (even though some of the problems would be easily fixed and we are willing to adapt to rapid changes as long as they are discussed and iterated).
---
So, just take a breath, take a break from the game if needed and wait a couple of months before deciding to biomass. 
---
**TLDR: Keep the raging towards CCP going, make them feel the heat, but at the same time give them some time to actually fix stuff.**
---
And CCP, you better present a roadmap cause this time around the anger is for real. Dont misinterpret whats happening here. Start fking listening to your customers (not this sub, well some of it is actually good) or you will soon be just another failed studio like many others before you that tried to be cute.
---
I am sorta confused about some of the people's comments about VINDI being "pussies" or "tucking tail and running" You do know VINDI isn't leaving Cache or moving right? Winter Co. is leaving us and we decided we didn't want to go into drone lands so we'd stay and fight for our little corner whatever the cost be but hey spin away my guys :P
---
The real silly part is, they have redone the new player experience about six times now.
---
Finally a great skin I can buy for m- oh wait
---
Guess I’ll get the bhaalgorn SKIN instead, maybe it’ll be just as goo- 
---
oh. Fuck. It’s literally zero effort. I’ve thrown up yak with more colour and detail than the new bhaalgorn SKIN. Guess the good SKINs are only for whales.
---
Damn it you beat me. Lol
---
I think you may have missed the part where they were vastly outnumbered. I sincerely doubt three lokis from an non wormholer group would engage that, would you?
---
Sure, as long as you're not the dude who has to light a cyno instead of participating in the fight, or watch a gate, or sit in a carrier that never gets dropped. Think about how many alts never see combat during a fight, then think about forcing each of those to be someone's main.
---
Hurricanes were 25m in 2011, things were definitely cheaper then

THE BEST SHIP IS FRIENDSHIP PLAYA
---
Wow didn’t innovate. They just kept piling on and making changes to a captive audience. The lack of competition and huge player base made any losses negligible. The fragmentation of the game via many servers created communities tailored to each smaller division of the player base. I played WoW since beta, FFXI, and other popular MMOs at the time.  They were the MOBA/BR of the time and WoW piggy-backed off the success of the RTS era. There’s a reason WoW survived, and it was the fact that the IP had a huge existing player base, coupled with its graphics running on a broad range of hardware at the time. They lost more players with graphical updates than anything else, way back when.
---
Eve doesn’t have much competition in the space it occupies. However, that space is small.
---
Also, player retention matters. For both veterans and newbros. The only point at which that changes, is when retention of new eclipses that of the old. Eve is trying to do both, and is failing to achieve traction in each area. You have to decide which one is more important and go for it. If you are a small company with a small player base, that risk is scary. If you are Blizzard... you can afford to try something and maybe even roll it back or double-down. If WoW added a BR mode, and it became wildly successful with that new audience AND overlapped with some vets... they are making bank. If they lose vets but gain more fresh blood, they can ride it out and cultivate that new audience.
---
I don’t think CCP has the resources to do so until they invest in a new game that has potential to earn and grow. Eve has maintained, but never over-performed.
---
Two separate problems really.  
---
Keep new players running for the hills in a couple of weeks and actually improving the game for everyone else.  Not mutually exclusive necessarily, but different problems.  
---
I think new players run away for a number of reasons.  
---
Awful on boarding.  People just don’t get how to actually fly their ships and how to move around.  This should be easy and not complex to fix.  Just do what every other game has, a series of well thought out activities of increasing complexity.  Maybe CCP will actually do this much at some point in the entire history of the game.  New players don’t want to watch YouTube to learn how to play the game.  Sorry...they don’t. 
---
The real problem is that Eve lacks both entertaining PvE and access to quick and fast PvP.  Full stop.  New people want to log in and within 10 min after the introduction missions are over shoot people in the face.  This is the tempo of just about every other game out there, and sadly would really require a re-thinking of just what PvP is in Eve.  
---
Honestly short of instanced combat, arena or ‘battlegrounds’ type of mechanics I am not sure how you could satisfy this tempo with Eve.  
---
The other problems like SOV mechanics, capitals, cyno, local, multi boxing,bots....that actually has almost zero impact on new players.  Almost all take months or years to really impact most peoples play. They need to be fixed to keep more veteran players happy, but that is another problem.
---
&gt; Run away because they have a huginn
---
yeah it was the huginn that made them not engage
---
We can't compare Eve of 15 years ago to Eve of now.
---
One of the main problems with gating freighters is how easy it is in this game to ignore escorts, blow up target and then suicide. Even tanked JF's are straight forward to blow up in highsec with CONCORD fail police coming to execute the gank fleet.
---
How the hell would this work in nul? it wouldnt. JF's don't have the HP to eat shots long enough to get out of their own way. Supers can one shot (for a lack of better term) JF's. pornmaker does this regularly. All hes waiting for is that classic mistake people seem to continuously make and all he needs is a second and its all over. 
---
I completely agree that the idea of convoy escorts SOUNDs super cool. But in this games pvp meta its a straight up nightmare. Eve doesnt exactly have many interesting PVP situations going on. It's mostly gang bang after gang bang. As a JF pilot I would never put the ship (10b) and the collateral (up to 150b+) on the line to make content for people.
---
I agree to delete jump freighters.
---
Yes, it is a waste of time.
---
OP, so you'd rather it be actionable if a player group organizes its members?
---
To be fair, we have those sites to thank for reasonable T2 rig prices.
---
And the overview is such low hanging fruit too.
---
Indeed
---
Sad to hear.
---
OP will be with us at least until Eve Vegas, instead of quitting now.
---
calm down grandpa
---
Keep your spirit up.
---
Correct yes, it's in some vps somewhere but it's not feasible to sweep the internet everyday looking for VPN services and blocking those providers.
---
Even if they setup the infrastructure to do this, to scan the internet and look for public vpn/proxy services, they would only be able to find potential listeners on tcp, which no one typically uses, if I had to guess I'd say probably in the neighborhood of 1-3% use tcp based VPN. (Admittedly this number is pulled from my ass, but I've been working in data centers/networking for a little over 20 years now. I've only seen tcp based VPN a handful of times.) 
---
Why spend all the time and effort to punish someone that is probably going to be a false positive anyway when your going to be sub 5% accurate? 
---
It's not ccp's call whether a country blocks for anything. Nor should it be their call to tell you how to computer, this turns into the drm argument all over.
---
Nanohels are a legit and valued ship in every kitey small gang.
---
[deleted]
---
Sure, dude. Go for it.
---
Thing is, CCP doesn't need vets. Their actions speak for themselves. They want new players that are going to pay for all the years of SP that veterans already have... and then get thrown under the bus when they realize they wasted all that money...
---
Oh I know it would never work now, which is why I said that in my last post. It would be cool if convoys were a thing though.
---
&gt;hinder new players accessing those skills far more than old players.
---
How many "new players" are able to afford a fully fit Triglavian ship but can't afford to just fucking go to Jita and pick up a skillbook that's barely 10m?
---
Short AAR: 
---
Final timer of the MinMil Fortizar in Kamela. It got rf'd by DHSJ a week ago. We form Nightmares together with 0-Cal and wait for the party to start. Sprectre in Kikis and DHSJ in Bhaalgorns pause the timer, so we jump in start shooting them. Provi followes up with their own Nightmare fleet. A big fight ensues, which lasts for over an hour.
---
Try to enable 64-bit in settings, that worked for me the other day :)
---
Probably the same number that couldn’t do it for racial ships when they added the remote buy+ inject functionality originally?
---
Or try disabling 32 bit, that worked for me!
---
The size is the problem. It would take well over a 1000 sabres to bubble the entire wreck, and those also are vulnerable to the rats.
---
Ah, right. The thousands of "new players" who literally cannot just gate to Jita to buy cheap skillbooks for some god forsaken reason. Who could ever forget.
---
Would be better if he also went into Legacy, PanFam, and Winter Co. revenues
---
Um, so bud. we only ask for help in response your what we've already seen you guys do. Specifically I strongly don't believe it's my job to provide content to any large group whatsoever.  You can check historically this btw.
---
&gt; The numerous "expansions" they boast about are small incremental updates compared to the new worlds you see in other MMO expansions.
---
I dunno, Apocrypha was pretty close to a real expansion
---
Wormhole space, T3 ships, etc. They added an entire area of the game that nearly a decade later still supports thousands of players.
---
&gt;risk averse
---
&gt;refusing to fight ten times your numbers including two supercaps
---

---
That's the struggle with it being a tutorial, though. You can't just keep heaping on more and more, the immediate early retention is what is required. The longer you teach someone, the less likely it is to grab their interest, and especially for eve you need to grab a player's interest since so much of this game requires a lot of player agency.
---
Ofc it feels a bit dirty, but on the other hand they warped 3 fleets onto us. Not really fair either
---
I don't have any :( I just have from Apple
---
Mostly to just avoid having to bash them all is my guess. This way he can sell them to the new residents at a profit as well.
---
First, I can believe many, many people would be fed up with CCP's bullshit over years.
---
Second, Alliances and Corporations are not cults. Their leadership has no power over you, and the worst they can do is kick you from the alliance/corporation.
---
Yeah. But the version before they made you mine for the materials to make the boosters, nobody liked that.
---
Why do you stop replying when proven wrong
---
Who else do you blame for the game mechanics?  Nobody but ccp has the power to create or change them.
---
Oh Jesus ....... You are a computing waste land.
---
Sounds like a feature, not a flaw ;)
---
J/k I hope you get it sorted.
---
Have you tried Farmville?
---
I said an actual asset. Plex is not an actual asset. It cannot be obtained thru gameplay.

What would happen if you stopped posting?   You should try it, it might be good for everyone.

he's free to not warp a third fleet into an already outnumbered one on grid. Until then yes he will be headshotted
---
I was just making almost the the same points you just did here, yesterday. It was another one of the “DO SOMETHING CCP, BUT NOT ____!” Posts. The players don’t know what they want, and the vitriol is really off-putting. It’s not just ccp they spew at, but anyone that makes a suggestion towards improving X too. It puts enthusiastic players off of investing into the game more heavily because the social community outside the game is awfully toxic. The player-driven communities inside the game are great, but we don’t interact with ccp in game, we do here, outside the game with all the toxicity.
---
But they might lose that fight alone and have no one else to blame or deflect, can't have that.
---
Either they need to court players with the existing gameplay, or change the gameplay to court players. The former isn’t a tenable strategy in the current space. The latter is what they will be forced to do, either with Eve or a new property.
---
I don't use what is "trendy", everybody has their own needs, and everybody likes something different, I work as programmer and Linux / Mac are the best OS for development (according to me), and yea I don't say that Windows is bad, it just doesn't suit my needs, of course Windows can be good for gaming / casual people.
---
Good point! And all is fair in war :)
---
Keep up the good content! I am in Fweddit which lives in Sisede so we aren't that far from each other. Maybe  we will see each other in space some time.
---
I was still a beginner when this event happend and for me it was a delight that I didn't needed to buy an expensive rattle to gain points and that I coul just take a venture/barge to farm the event.
---
tbh i've honestly come to accept that EVE Online is dying, if not dead already and it wont ever recover
---
The "Era of Chaos" (at least imo) was CCP being extremely desperate to try and save the sinking ship, now CCP has no idea what to do so they have just given up
---
I hope I am proven wrong but honestly i've just came to accept that this is the reality of the situation and as much as I dont like it, a time will come with EVE Online is no longer profitable and Pearl Abyss pulls the plug or the devs just abandon it and that time is coming soon, very soon.
---
If LR bomber were a little less oppressive it might actually be fun. Fighting small carrier groups + support with 6-7 nanobois can be a good time. Just becomes too much when a super or a fax lands.
---
Pretty normal from every nullsec alliance though, it's a daily occurance and pretty much a meme at this point that an Orthrus will come after your Tech I frigate if you roam null in one, and then call you a pussy when you warp off. Or a Super who drops on everyone who brawls saying how only f\*\*\*\*\* kiters are coming to his space and he just doesn't understand why, and how they only dropped 3 supers a FAX and 2 titans on your 3 cruisers because you were kiting, even though they did the same thing to a HAM Drake 2 hours ago.

&gt;  fitting WCS instead of DDAs or application or agility or tank/grid mods won't effect isk/hr at all.
---
You used to fit a 100mn VNI with a Medium Armor Rep, WCS,and 4DDAs without any meaningful loss of isk/hr.
---
You can easily slap on a WCS to a Dominix or a Myrm and achieve the same bullshit.
---
Does sound work though
---
1v1 me in battle Nereus?
---
&gt;when and why did CCP wipe characters?
---
They don't...?????
---
They don't, you've been hacked and your account drained, contact customer support.
---
I have played since 2016 and haven't heard of any character wipes. My bet is you got hacked and since it's been so long getting them back is gonna be hard.
---
Try to contact CCP but prepare yourself mentally for a fresh start.
---
You got hacked dude. Try opening a support ticket.
---
Did you check your asset safety?
---
WD40 cleans it off pretty easily. Some elbow grease is needed, but not much.
---
Yes, with no problem
---
Where did you have your stuff? Could it be in asset safety?

They were just using the Fabian Strategy my dude, which means they won.

Why not both?

Friends in TEST run it with titans outside the super umbrella. I think if he wants to take it he should have to work for it not get lucky on RNG server ticks.
---
Minmatar ships murdering Amarr ones in Providence. I expect diplomatic consequences.
---
&gt;Correct yes, it's in some vps somewhere but it's not feasible to sweep the internet everyday looking for VPN services and blocking those providers.
---
There is a finite number of addresses and most are assigned. Major hosting providers are known. You could probably get rid of 90% of all VPNs in a day if you wanted to.
---
&gt;Even if they setup the infrastructure to do this, to scan the internet and look for public vpn/proxy services, they would only be able to find potential listeners on tcp, which no one typically uses, if I had to guess I'd say probably in the neighborhood of 1-3% use tcp based VPN.
---
They will not scan anything. They would start by blocking the IP ranges of all major providers that sell VPSs or any form of dedicated server. Every time a bot is banned, they would check the IP and if its not from a "normal" ISP, that range is banned. If you work in networking, you know about whois/ripe/arin/bgp, etc.
---
&gt;Why spend all the time and effort to punish someone that is probably going to be a false positive anyway when your going to be sub 5% accurate? 
---
No one truly needs to connect from a hosting provider assigned IP except in very rare cases. Blocking these should basically not impact the game other than getting rid of cheaters using VPNs to distribute bots onto many IPs to avoid detection.
---
&gt;It's not ccp's call whether a country blocks for anything. Nor should it be their call to tell you how to computer, this turns into the drm argument all over.
---
You are free to use VPNs if you want, but they are also free to block you. They are not telling you how to use your computer, they are telling you how you can use THEIR computer.
---
But.. but sir says I must log on every day and rat in my vexor until he lets me stop. 
---
Then he says I need to send him half my ISK so he can "double it". He's not sent any back yet, but I'm sure he will one day.
---
The rest of the ISK I've saving through my past 250 hours in game is being saved towards a firesale that sir is selling me! **9.6 billion worth of stolen corp loot for only 960 mil** , can you believe it? I can't wait to buy it all from him!
---
If the investment is 'safe' and comparatively low investment, is there any barrier for more null alt pilots to set up farm holes? If the money is good why aren't more players flocking to fight over a slice of that sweet Bob baked pie? 
---
This feels more like a playstyle politics issue. Some null entities don't want to deal with wormhole mechanics so they'd rather shit in the bowl of w-hole-grain fleets.
---
&gt;are we at all going to talk about how much a problem it actually is when a player group can tell it's players to vote with their wallets and then that proceeds to happen?
---
&gt;​
---
&gt;Because that's. . . . that really not a good thing for anyone.
---
This literally has never happened. Nobody will listen to someone who's telling them to play or not to play. I don't know why you think this is a thing. It's not. Unless they're 12. And that person is their mum. And their mum has a mean backhand when they don't pipe down.
---
Lol, I’m not interested in the bears, I just want them out of null sec and back in high sec where they belong so the big block corps will collapse and we can go back to hundreds of small null sec corps all scrapping it out, that was when this game was the most fun.
---
Was that around the same time when the worms/gilas/rattlesnakes were abandoning drones to make super tristans/vexors/domis? Or did CCP just not really fix the issue?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/2ak7i4/eve_news_drone_damage_exploit_notification_ccp/
---
&gt;Well people are always saying the game was better back in the day
---
People are also full of shit though.
---
And they view the past through rose tinted goggles.
---
I'd rather be Ernest, not Frank.
---
Anything is botable though. Even PvP.
---
Better cheat detection methods should be enabled.
---
Sucks to suck, pal.
---
If the game shuts down tomorrow, the Imperium goes out on top. suits just fine.

&gt;outside of halfbaked pve that only a handful of folks do
---
Abyss/invasions etc are pretty popular are they not?
---
Always headshot Pred. Always. Fuck that guy.
---
The bug was in a similar vein, but in this case it was directly tied to the indy core. So it did also give drone damage. Similar bug, but different pathway. This was later than the rattle/gila bug. But using this the rorq could drop the damage drone, have a gila pick them up, and you get a 1000 drone dps gila
---
What ever is needed to seed all of 0sec with enough keepstars and titan caches.

trig invasions spread out to ~~three~~ two jumps from the foothold, in this case doril happens to be in range

```If the money is good why aren't more players flocking to fight over a slice of that sweet Bob baked pie?```
---
They are. There are a a surprising amount of kspace bearholes. I've not counted but I would estimate 50+. Frat, Snuff, TEST &amp; Razor come to mind as common names. We never see ships belonging to these groups in wspace, just their structures.
---
Can we just wait for eve Vegas?
---
Why do those when you can afk Ishtars in nullsec? Sure people do abyss and incursions but the overwhelming majority afk rat when doing ratting-type PVE.
---
Remove killmails as a thing then people won't be worried about the shame of losses or gloat about kills.  Then PVP is purely for the joy of it.
---
if you leave i will gladly keep your stuff safe.
---
Cool battles are a bit scarcer.
---
You can do everything you could ages ago, rat mine run missions, there’s even new things like exploration and instanced solo pve.  
---
People will hate you worse than they used to.  But that’s life in eve
---
CCP disable all graphics besides UI when?
---
I’m sorry that you think pve ships should willingly die to pvp shops that only take fights they can win and use the fastest safest engagement powering ships ingame to do it and wanna blame pve for that.
---
WHers don’t have static jumpgates and more tedious... not dangerous.  The only reason people don’t cry “bot” at wh bots is because they are private ones

1.  Yes sure.  But you could fit a cyno on the capital for help which was the entire fucking debate.  Don’t pretend to be too stupid to get that
---
2. The cyno was on every capital .  
---
3. with current changes you train a separate alt to cloak ingrid with you or more.
---
Seriously people what the fuck this isn’t even a debate these are just observations of what did exist vs what does it shouldn’t be this hard for you to get no matter how retardedly emotional you get over hating capitals
---
Improved in what way?
---
You are my favourite poster, you are the living breathing essence of this sub atm.
---
I use a carrier nowadays, run abyss or incursions in highsec. Never ratted AFK personally, I don't like to not know what's going on. Did a null incursion the other day and it was a lot of fun too. But that's just me I guess.
---
You do realize Rote/Unspoken, who showed up on your side, lost over 20b right? not 4b? The BR has the numbers right at the top, so it's really easy to call your BS.
---
And that for most of the fight your fleet was irrelevant because it was too small and not on field?
---
You've "claimed" to be able to form 40 muninns, and I've never seen you pull enough of them to volley anything of interest.
---
g^(F)
---
You fucking retarded monkey.  Capitals fit cynos onto their own ships now they can’t
---
Are you that dense?  Even a monkey would learn that something is different looking at fits that had cynos and now don’t and to get help need another account
---
You are fucking dumb as hell and the fact that you’re sticking to this is just pathetically desperate you can’t argue against the facts, it’s not a debate
---
Shut up and think for once
---
Jesus Christ I don’t use Linux and even I think you’re a salty asshole. Who pissed in your corn flakes?
---
I agree its pretty awesome sauce
---
What flavor were the paint chips?
---
Don't say it too loud. 
---
The inquisition looks for heretics !
---
(official)rumor has it that the triglavian working on  capships
---
I recall 75% for most regions and 100% for cache.
---
Always shoot Derp Elite.
---
Yeah I know, I expect that through September but historically it picks up a bit in October.  I do think they are holding back for Vegas however.
---
Really can’t fight provi bloc batphoning TEST while already outnumbering us.
---
kinda feels bad we got caught on our way back to home but it’s our fault anyway.
---
Considering the ease with which null alliances will drop caps on anything more threatening than belt rats, I can't imagine why anyone would use anything *but* kitey BS in tyool 2019
---
Yeah, but there's no catalyst gankers in null.
---
Don't worry, I'm sure they'll talk a big game.  Maybe 5% of it will actually ever make it into the game, though, like normal.  But the devs reeeeeing about how great they are will make most of these people hopeful enough to stick around, like normal.
---
Lol you weren't even playing when blackout was a thing
---
I'm not convinced it is though. I haven't seen it do that in wormholes, or during the invasions, or anywhere else except the abyss.
---
Where was test
---
Dunking the shit put of your alliance
---
Goon here - multi-rorq/indy pilot, left during Blackout and enjoying WoW Classic - Blackout is gone, but with the changes in cynos...seems like mining would be a pain, not as bad as blackout, but still...having to get a recon to babysit with cyno everytime you want to go out?  Ditto moving my suitcase carrier and freighter around without throwaway tech I cyno ships...looking for an excuse to come back...or not...
---
Change citadel timers to the old POS (stront) system and lower the number of timers. Boom, you still get the 'good' parts while removing the timers.
---
And yes, remove injectors.
---
unless you mine or produce stuff.
---
Great wildlands just got more interesting
---
I think you mean "created" from gameplay.
---
File under “why people are not enjoying eve”
---
Dude it's "perimeter" therefore it's actually in TheForge !
---
Sorry.
---
Hail Bob.
---
I have heard that they use more experimental stuff in the abyss so they can try different things without it affecting the whole world. The blue and orange clouds are one example of this. The thing in your image that is being artifacted is probably another.
---
Either way, you should probably file an in-game bug report.
---
you realise ships costs money  right?
---
Well shoot. This is the first one I'm going to and I could be going to a wake. FML.
---
just ignore the spacepoors. upset cause other people put more effort into the game and, gasp, get more out of it. unacceptable.
---
It'll never happen so there's no reason to even acknowledge them
---
Delete alts 🙏
---
95% of Eve's problems are due to the broken nature of scaling alts so easily. And while I'm getting downvoted: obligatory Fuck AT.
---
Most ship losses can be made up pretty easily.  A lot of corps, though, get pissed off at anyone who loses a ship and gets red on their KB.
---
You're supposed to pretend that it was a lucky fluke and that they put up such a good fight that you're already scared of the next one.
---
You say that as if we decided to call our friends *after* we formed.
---
In a way you guys are a victim of your own actions. Your well known history of batphoning people for fights like these (especially on Saturday afternoons) makes it a good chance for Legacy groups to get some content.
---
I do think about it :) I would never join goons or any of their affiliates. Not because i despise the entity, or don't see the benefits. But the simple fact remains, that the game become more stale if everyone does it.
---
Also not everything is about isk. As an example, fun is probably equally as important. And if you think it's fun to log on and the rats being your most dangerous  adversary, then more power to you. But personally i think that sounds very boring.
---
Heresy! Bob is unforgiving of those who do not undock (whelp or gank, He doesn't seem to be that picky)
---
Snore
---
The inverse would be equally annoying wouldn’t it? Imagine devs with an eager banhammer, on a monthly basis constantly rendering ships useless that you just spend 2bil or tons of time skilling into?   Every time I found a ship with a powerful niche, I would be hesitant to bother ... assuming imminent banhammer. I’d be equally enraged. 
---
I assume you’ll make the point of “yeah but balance prob X has existed for 4 years !  Screw CCP”... sure I guess, but they need to sort out the data between the vocal few who dominate the “community” voice versus the reality of the entire player base, many of whom don’t grab pitchforks and take to the forums to protest
---
The argument about the fall a rise of player numbers I find equally flawed.  People complain about botters and AFK isk farming.. then they implement something to combat it, and people rage about player numbers plummeting.  Aren’t those possible botters and afk farmers or alts that didn’t really represent player contributors anyways ?
---
The game offers plenty of other ways to carebear.
---
Dude join a corp that teaches you stuff, thats not how you fit a proc. PH, Brave etc
---
Ye Im not saying we should remove HICs or anything. It was just an example of exploits. Its not new that wormholers have exploited lots of shit. 
---
I understand how WHs work in this aspect since I roll them myself and I dont know how to fix it, thats up to you guys.
---
My point is that there are problems all over. And CCP can easily nerf C5 and C6s just like theyve done to NS tons of times. They should in fact do this and actually fix the astra thing.
---
Instead the very same people that have exploited tons of shit and still do whilst making very safe isk in their bear holes are sitting there pointing fingers at others. You see why we might get upset?
---
But goons do paps for mining as well
---
I recently switched to Win 10. The UI is a fucking Joke.
---
Tbh I'm not even upset with players at this point. The marginal amount of effort of moving a super fleet, and not feeling like it, are legitimately the only thing keeping smaller groups from being deleted from Sov Null. And it seems increasingly that those two insignificant things are enough of a threat that these small groups have to join blocs.
---
Still dont like it tho 😔
---
Oh wow cool ruse
---
/s
---
well then dont join those corps lol and for most people loosing a loki isnt a small loss
---
While I empathize and you’re entitled to your perspective. Why tell the community “I quit”? Who cares.  Even worse “I’m thinking about quitting”..
---
You’re just seeking sentiment validation because either you know you’re not going to quit or you are and you need validation. 
---
Either have something constructive to say or don’t say it perhaps ?  You didn’t even mention a single thing that’s important to you or your playstyle. 
---
I’m genuinely not trying to harsh you, just have something thoughtful to say rather than “whaaa I’m gonna quit... I think”
---
Is isk really a concern in eve 2019?
---
yes not everyone is a billionare super ratter or has 40 rorq alts
---
This is why I stopped playing. So many good fights used to be had, now it's all just getting dropped on by 5x your numbers and them up shipping.
---
I remember when I would just spend hours camping the hed-gp area with bombers bar. Even if we got nothing it was fun
---
This is a very good tool!  Keep up the good work!
---
12 one month old characters all with similar names were running c5 sites in leshaks this morning
---
It's different, because they do it unironically. If bees dunk on horde 1000 to 100, they'll brag about it, but were like haaa.. riiight. A -7- pilot is going to go out and custom print a t-shirt and coffee mug with the system name over a fight like this.
---
TLDR NIP bluetral to goons so they wouldn't get their skulls caved in accepted a bribe to join formally.
---
Looks like he’s subscribed to it already judging from his question in r/eve
---
That’s a lot of words to say “skill injectors”
---
As bad as yesterday, but definitely better than the day before yesterday...
---
and yet they're still too dumb to realize that people don't choose to play an MMO long term based on how shiny the first 30 minutes of the game are.  Funnily enough, one of the first NPE revamps was the best one they've done, everything after has been progressively worse.  The NPE was never the problem, it's the rest of the game after the NPE ends.  Which is what they refuse to do any meaningful changes to for 5+ years.
---
You got me. Have an upvote
---
Honestly?  It needs both.  People here seem to think CCP should only be able to do one or the other just because they do neither.   Any real company does fixes AND new content, there's a reason EVE is superniche.  People just seem to give CCP a pass because of how terrible they've been at this over the last 15 years.
---
It's also one they said will basically never happen again, because it took ::work::
---
No they didn't, they just called minor content patches "free expansions".  That doesn't mean they were actual expansion-level content.
---
&gt; HTP try their usual move
---
Sounds about right
---
The fact that this seems to be the only thing that even gets their (limited) dev time for the past year makes their cluelessness even more apparent.
---
Mid tier? Rote= bottom tier
---
The thing is, a vast majority of EVE's old "expansions" were just minor content patches to any other company, it was just market speak to say "FREE EXPANSIONS!".  There's only one or two that could really be considered expansions.  Now they say they're doing "agile" development, but in reality, they're rarely even dropping content-patch levels of content anymore.  And the little they do drop has either no testing, no thought for the long term consequences, or both.
---
No, 2008 actually. You know, back when more than 20 people logged into the game because there was actually shit to do.
---
Give them time?   This isn't a new problem, it's been an issue for 5+ years at least.  Time is not the problem, it is apathy and lack of direction.  If there's one thing they've shown, its that they don't give a fuck unless half of their players quit.
---
I see proviblock still posts thier few victories to reddit. Never change provi lmao
---
You are really showing how little you know about how much effort it takes to manage a big campaign.
---
I dont disagree. But at the same time people are uberraging extra atm. Expecting changes but not giving them time wont work. I for one will give them one last chance before starting to look for other game. I dont expect anything real until after christmas, after that well fkem if they cant deliver.
---
Many of us were hoping that when you quit it would mean you would stop posting￼.
---
The problem is that current new players think they should be able to have 100M SP at the start.  There is PLENTY of content for low SP players; it's like expecting to start WoW with full level capped characters and best in slot within the first week.  It makes absolutely no sense.  The people that think this way are not going to stick around anyway, because once they get the skill points they'll realize nothing really changes.
---
&gt; Those systems are meant to be the only truly safe systems in eve
---
Says who? The lore and fluff about the Incursions and the Invasions both say that Concord encourages Capsuleers to help fight off the rats b/c Concord cannot handle it by themselves. So what makes you think they can defend the starter systems?
---
The only reason Concord is OP against us, is b/c all our ships are built with secret backdoor programming for Concord to shut us down. They can't override Sanshas and Trigs, so they'd have to actually put up a fight.
---
Reminds me of when Suitonia would come to Geminate in a *kestrel* and like 20 dudes would start chasing him. For an 8m kestrel. The guy always cane out super isk positive too lol
---
Yeah but you would kinda be turned off the game if you haven’t even left the tutorial yet and still die.
---
Says good game design. Sure the lore says a lot of that, but it really sucks for new players to get 360 no-scoped by a mechanic they barely understand.
---
Might want to clear your cache or validate your files again, clearing cache can be done in the settings, verifying files in the launcher
---
Why the claymore have a cyno
---
People forget that back in the day belt ratting chaining was not a lot isk. And ships were not that much cheaper compared to current income streams.
---
To be fair, most of the events getting shit were the ones they made with huge flaws that were way worse than the originals.  Bonus points for half of them being broken and literally giving no rewards to people.
---
The Warzone Extraction drifter event was so much fun. So many bling ships dying in them.
---
I actually agree with you. My post is really there to test the pulse on the community and to validate if my own feelings are shared and warranted (they seem to be). 
---
If you look at my post history I have been championing for change in this game for a while from a more punishing play style but I am more than happy to compromise with the general population who are also equally frustrated with lack of meaningful changes to gameplay. 
---
At this point all that seems left to do is wait and watch the end of this road to see if things will turn around. ( I want to believe they will).
---
You forgot about ( and)
---
Stuff has NOT gone up in Eve at all. ISK has lost it's value, and these are two very different problems.
---
F
---
Then why is it not on the EVE website, but instead on a third party site?  A workaround is not the same thing as supported.
---
Local should be based on the area you spend the majority of your game time.  Like for everyone in k space it works like it does now because we are registered with the fluid router systems. However, for wormholers, they dont get to see local, because they arent regularly registered with the fluid router network, but they do show up in local as the gate systems pick them up in local.
---
Cool,  glad you’re able to introspect on this.  I played Eve for about 1 year in 2014 and now just got back into it, so far having a blast.  But Eve is not a way of life for me, mainly a fun evening distraction, but I’m certainly putting some effort into it and experimenting with a ton of different play styles.  But, I’m just not particularly clued into or care about the big “null bloc” powers and politics.  Nor the self important eve celebs who take to the forums to announce their departure, as if it makes a difference to new eden. 
---
I can understand why someone who’s played Eve consistently for a decade or more would burn out on it though, then again I can’t think of a single mmo that would even come close to holding my attention that long.   DAMN YOU makers of Everquest!!!
---
Heat sink.
---
It's much better compared to what we had in 08.... Nothing.
---
Ermm....I chain belts in my Nyx. Makes caps spawn more frequently.
---
You lost a T3C didn't you? Because even though that's a stupid reason to be so pissy about this post, there's really not a less sad explanation.
---
Yeah well you're stupid tier HAHAHAHA
---
Cruisers have always been hot dropped by titans- ask PL what they got up to all over new Eden between 2008 &gt; 2015
---
If you are in a null block yeah end game is shit because that's what null blocks have made it.
---
 "**Those** who would **give up** essential **Liberty**, to purchase a little temporary Safety, **deserve neither Liberty nor** Safety."
---
Abyssal deadspace is the most Icelandic thing in all of EVE.
---
Why is it stupid?
---
Damn straight.
---
Do you think regular local is better?
---
That's why they're going to start giving noobs Grief Counseling when they die. So they can learn early, that sometimes you die in Eve.
---
That’s why it’s delayed local instead of removed local, you can’t cloaky camp for that long or you’ll show up on local anyway
---
Yeah, they told us not to Grief in the starter systems. That doesn't mean rats can't spawn and shoot at people.
---
If it were clear, then it wouldn't be happening.
---
i approve this awesome post. keep at it buddy, you know were behind ya!
---
Yea.  Just because of that fact I'll actually be posting more.
---
You have this backwards. The kiters are cowards because they want to score easy kills on helpless ratters, with zero risk. Meanwhile the superpilots are honorable bushido pvpers™ who only brawl like men, risking their multi-dollar spaceships in the process.  
---
Also eve is so dead these days, i don't know why there is no content. We are already doing our best to blue everything around us, and we diligently gangbang any roaming gang with 10 titans. I don't get why the game is stagnating.
---
