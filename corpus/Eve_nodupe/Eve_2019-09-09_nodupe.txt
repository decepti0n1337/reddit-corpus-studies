What is the module with a blue cross on the action bars icon  ?
---
its worse then that its actually a recording of gooncoms and horde coms. With a second gooncoms aswell.
---
Depends on how many you want made, how customized you want them, and if you want embroidery or printing.
---

---
Embroidery tends to look better, but is iffy on some kinds of logos. you want a limited colour palette with that. It's also significantly more expensive. 
---
The how many is due to initial setup fees for the print or embroidery. As you get more, you smear the fee wider.
---
If you want names added, that's more, as it's a difference per shirt.
---
Take a look at places which do custom workwear if you're not looking for customization per shirt. 
---
https://www.workwearexpress.com/ for a uk example. I've purchased a few things from them.
---
If you're wanting customization per item (logo + name isn't uncommon) expect to pay more. Look into work and team embroidery.
---
I think you should be able to undock, but any implants that require Omega won't provide any kind of bonuses.
---
So u didnt loot the grid then :)?
---
This made me chuckle. For some reason, I read it in Data's voice.
---
These are not all the BR's just the ones where the NPSI fleet was helping the attackers.

---
right like... anyone saying there's no counter for frigates is an idiot. What's stopping them from bringing their own frigates or destroyers, hey?  
---
shit, sometimes they do.
---
In this fleet, TAPI showed me everything you dont do with jackdaws.
---
Haven't tested it myself as far as Clones go.
---
But as far as ships and modules go, you cannot undock with anything Omega restricted. Even if you are sitting in the ship right now (you were Omega last time you logged out) you will not be able to undock. If you have modules that require Omega, either it will not let you undock at all, or they cannot be brought online.
---
So I'd say the game probably won't let you undock with the Clone at all. It's possible it would just suppress the effects, but I don't think they have that coded out. You can't exactly "offline" implants, they're either implanted or they aren't.
---
You didnt catch anything of ours in this fleet. Not in 46DP, or anywhere else.
---
You gorned munnins, after we raped the jackdaws, and took jump bridges to 46DP. You proceeded to camp the 77s8 gate for a few minutes while we stayed tethered on the raitaru. 
---
I was there.
---
huh, well this is an interesting use for spies. i'm not gonna lie, i would hate spies a lot less if they provided this sort of thing more often
---
That is one hell of a long write up. Sorry you died and sorry your Corp had no active members to help you hold your hole and all its assets. Props for at least going down with a fight.
---
Blackout has caused an increase in activity though! The data proves it! Honest! More subs then ever!
---
He's not an authorized HK Rental manager.  Make sure you only send isk to authorized rental managers.
---
As someone who has talked a lot about this question with members of the Eve streaming community over the years:
---
You really can't ever cover up enough of your screen to be immune from stream sniping.  System names will pop up in all kinds of places and someone who's motivated will see them.
---
The people I've known who have had the best time streaming Eve are those who cover up the critical stuff (say, fleet chat, local, system name, route) and then roll with the chance of someone trying to track you down and kill you.  One trick that is handy is to set up a hotkey to blank out the stream for a short time when something sensitive is going on, like scouting.
---
Really, though, I'd try doing it and see how it goes.  Don't stress too much about stream sniping.  It's only likely to happen at any scale once your viewer numbers have ramped up.
---
Good luck!
---
Seems like an anti blackout post and yet you started off so well
---
Yea, lotta skill involved in 'ANCHOR UP AND PRESS F1' guys, listen to Bo_Hunt, the last of EVE's warrior caste.
---
PVP means Player Vs Player, just in case you needed to be told.  Any time you as a player engage another player in any way shape or form, you are involved in PVP.
---
I declare that ur gaypwned

Of course! Also, these are public fleets, so you're welcome to come. I even did a bombers bar training video if you want more details about how we do =D

They made a ship called the jackdaw?  Seems like Test would be forced to fly only those in memefleets.

I think you must of come into the game with Paranoia trained to  V. You'll do fine in this game. Just don't go Stalin on your friends.
---

---
It's interesting watching the effect the Blackout is having on nullsec. It seems winning Blackout is who can keep people logging in.
---
oh, buddy that sounds super complicated... i think i'd much rather keep it simple and consistent.  
---
Although, the lure of ramming into another ship to inflict damage does harden my armor if you know what i mean, but... ugh... nah maybe not in this game
---
You don't think killing a target before the blob of a defense fleet can come eat you is PVP?
---
not as easily or as accurately post-cyno changes.  also form-time is a factor.
---
IMO replace get rid of torps on bombers and get rid of nullification on t3cs if the blackout if going to be kept.  a few of the covert systems need reigned in a tad.
---
Or alternatively don't play with 100 mongoloids.
---
What I was shown was a separate chat client running side by side with the game's local. The client that was piggie-backed was showing a client list.

Nice Neanderthal-tier Dunning-Kruger's you got here...

---
*Violent coughing*
---
The might beans
---
From experience, what's stopping them is the logistics of scrambling a large enough fleet with a good enough comp to be effective.  If you ping "Rorq save get harpies" you'll get maybe 50 ships within the time frame you need.  50 capitals is powerful; 50-man harpy fleet is not.
---
uh, big asterisk on that, he comes and goes
---
Bleh. Reminder to CCP that "more effort" =/= more difficulty. It just means grind, and it's universally bad. 
---
There's no reason indy cynos should be restricted to something that's hard to carry in a jf, like a 20k m3 industrial, vs a noobship. It just makes jf pilots put more work into jfing. It doesn't make jfing a more complex, engaging or dangerous task. You just have to do more of it. 
---
"Difficulty vs effort" is the difference between playing 1 chess game against Gary Kasparov and 10,000 tic-tac-toe games against a dumb computer program. Adding more tic-tac-toe is a bad way to balance something you think is too strong. If you want JFing to be less efficient, jack up the fuel cost. Route prices will go up but you won't make my logistics guy kill himself. 
---
Let indy cynos be used on any ship type. Let regular caps jump to them but it makes it impossible to use modules for 10 minutes. Keep logistics easy while keeping non-recon cynos out of combat.
---
I just used a credit card to get 27.3b isk worth of plex and was only charged the 20 claimed in the op, I'm at work though and won't be able to log in to convert that into titans until I get home
---
Idk as a solo player having reinforcements arrive even faster than they already do would be a pain in the ass. Blob warfare would be greatly buffed if warp speed of all ships was buffed.
---
LIES and slander! It's only the bots quitting... right? .. right?

gonna play the devil's advocate here... what if there was a bug that wasn't effecting everyone? like maybe only the 64bit client people saw the thing?  
---
idk man i've seen weird visual bugs in this game, which other people did not see. I'm not saying i think or know this is what happened, but it would explain some shit.
---
Hillmar can go Fuck himself
---
You know, I agree that it is unfair that some people research and learn how to best do something, and put more effort into it.   No way that should give someone an advantage.
---
I would like to say that me and my buddy would have never played Eve if it wasn't for dust 514. If they brought that back even as is we would jump back on it in a heartbeat.
---
Garric Shadowbane made some shirt for Rote Kapelle and they are sick. Hit him up. He's super responsive on order status and ships on time as well.
---
So if they can't field enough dudes in a reasonable composition to defend themselves, then they lose the fight. That's just eve.
---
You could ask a guy called Judge. He could give a good first hand account of how hard it was/is to do.
---
&gt; Init pooped on hk

This is a much better AAR than init's actual AAR.
---
I see them all over hisec still.  They are expensive to set up and expensive to maintain, but if thats your thing they still do their jobs.
---
yeah garter i think you misunderstood. He's saying that there is a *solid counter* for stukas, and it is AF/T3D. Not that they used it here today.
---
what makes them better than navy hammerheads?
---
Eve is not as hardcore and in fact depends on building coronations and infrastructures.
---
Others have already explained how the game mechanics work to "even" the playing field a la timers.
---
I'll just add that it also depends on where you go in the game; nullsec means you either have to rent space or get squished by giant coalitions.
---
Wormholes are even less forgiving if you're evicted because you lose everything. But small groups can do really well here since there isn't a giant nullsec sized 800lb gorilla in your neighborhood. 
---
People like small gangers of wh space. We blow each other up a lot but it's all skirmishes rather than life otr death situations. Most of the time.
---
Sad to see what happened to mighty beans for example.
---
Undock is always yellow now
---
You know that feeling... the one where you click set destination on a system and find out it's like, 40 jumps away, and you're all like, naw fam, and go back to spinning your pretty spaceship in your safe little hangar?  That feeling?  Thats why ships are "slow as fuck".  If you make everything twice as fast, space starts to feel twice as small.  You don't want your space to feel small do you?  No, of course you don't.
---
you dont train first what is going to benefit you the most in the long run, but what benefits you immediately. in the long run, you just train into everything.
---
rather than looking at weapon systems, look at ships that can bring you the highest yield. drone boats and then missile boats are good for this -sth sth guristas i fucking hate that ship lineup btw- but some gunboats can be fit to excel at niche pve.
---
confessor with small energy turrets can be worth a look for c3 wolf rayets and sansha/blood/drone sites
---
You think its fun just sitting there? Isk or not, that is a boring meta you want eve to adapt.
---
Not sure - you should ask GOTG though

---
I strongly dislike that people have to watch their highsec miners constantly... like it's already not worth it.  
---
But i do understand that botters need to be exploded. Wish there was a better way. Some kinda space-captcha to cycle their module, then it runs until the bay is full? sounds dumb, though :/
---
&gt;You forgot about erebus....
---
There were a bunch of jackdaws here, though. But for some reason they weren’t able to do anything useful, and the bombers were doing fine until they got hit by a doomsday
---
I see you are a woman of taste.
---
If that’s the case, why were the jackdaws unable to kill anything here? I’ve been in Stuka fleets that went straight up against HACs and won, they aren’t the hard counter that people say they are. Meanwhile jackdaws get eaten by kikis if they get close, and if they kite away then the stukas can boosh away and be out of range
---
Is a Marauder not a sitting duck in a WH anom? What happens when 2 or 4 Loki’s jump on you?

How often do you lose a Gila to gankers in a WH? Any tricks other than spam Dscan, which is completely useless given WH murderers are in cloaky T3s...
---
There was actually a post in this subreddit a while back of someone taking the *EVE* metagame style into *Ark*. Was entertaining.
---
Here, the existence of safe places to keep your stuff means that it's hard to completely wipe out a group. Most characters operate out of High-Sec (even if more players are affiliated with NullBlocs, people generally have at least one alt there), which is full of NPC stations. In SovNull, there are timers and asset safety. Even in J-Space, there are timers. In order to kick you out of your space, people have to show up and stay in your home area  for a few days. In general, the most effective evictions involve sabotage from within (and sometimes threats to cut of people's hands).
---
Is there a way to look up POCO's tax rates without having to actually travel to the POCO to find out?
---
Perhaps after his initial investment of 8 hours a day of constant grinding to get his own fleet and multiple characters to even gain the efficiency that he can now pull off at 1.5 hrs a day.
---
Spectre isn't necessarily neutral, they're their own thing. The only difference between them and a corp is the lack of commitment (anyone can join a fleet whenever with no repercussion) and a lack of discrimination for targets, shoot whatever isn't in fleet.
---
As a part of the new "Chaos Era" they are now going to start announcing features that will never actual be released into the game just to fuck with the playerbase.
---
That's the main advantage of the Caracal. Even a good fit is less than 50Mn, which makes it great for learning nano or PvP in general. And the versatility of the ship cannot be overstated.
---
Don't restart your cycles, the planet treats it as a full extraction cycle so you get less from where you are currently set up even though you're cycle was half finished
---
Honestly, I don't think it's the warp speed that needs to be tweaked too much, maybe a bit, but what we really need is an adjustment to the warp acceleration and deceleration. Currently a battle ship will sit on grid for a few seconds immobile as it's coming out of warp.
---
IIRC the warp deceleration comes from when the grids were smaller, which made sense, but now that we have massive grids, this kind of never got touched up.
---
You want to know something? I told my corp mates for years I would never rorq mine. Soon after black out happened I had NO CHOICE but to rorq mine if I wanted to get ore. Rorqual mining is the only way to efficiently mine today without dying left and right. I hate mining, but blackout and all the bs from ccp has made it obvious its the only way to go in null.
---
 ~~Either~~  This is a total shit post ~~or~~ AND you need to retake 3rd grade math. 
---
Fixed it for you.
---
you can anchor and use them still but there is no telling how long they will remain in the game CCP has made noise about removing them so it could be 6 weeks or 2 years.
---
Its often not worth dislodging a competent corp from say...a wormhole. Or lowsec. But if you try to move into an nullsec alliances space without permission they will wipe you out.
---
Most corps dont fail from losing structures or ships. They die when moral hits rock bottom and all the players stop having fun so they leave.
---
Most major alliances that have died in the game have suffered a loss in battle that cost them such a massive chunk of fairweather players that they are good as dead. 
---
Goons are one of the strongest alliances because they know how to keep moral up in the face of loss.
---
Anyones to be on topic. If you want to build a base, claim a wormhole, set it up with all the combat structures you want, build capitals and so on. You will be neigh untouchable as capitals can not move into wormholes, they have to be built inside.
---
&gt;You’ll obviously need a gang for this to work
---
I'd just like to underline this point. The Jackdaw's main advantage is range, it has a papertank but can hit out to 76km even with shit skills and over 100 on some fits (IIRC). This is absolutely amazing in a fleet or smallgang setting but atrocious for a solo setting. You need dedicated tackle/points that can hold long enough for the DPS to land, something like an assault frigate works great. In a solo setting, if you're close enough to even point kite (even with an abyssal point) then you're close enough to kill really quickly.

Being shitty to a kid over pixels or being shitty to a kid in RL, it's still being shitty to a kid.
---
I mean, to be fair, if you get boson'd in goku/stuka you did something seriously wrong or derped.  Not sure I'd consider that a counter.
---
I extended all the sensitive stuff to different monitors (playing windowed mode across 3) and then blurred out things like the names of gates and distances on my overview as well as what I'm aligning to/orbiting/etc.
---
People still had their way with me sometimes tho.
---
Critical Horizon is growing fast and kicking the shit out of WH space.
---
You can wipe out corps?
---
That's simple reality though.  The attackers often take upwards of 15-30 minutes to form their fleet, they can take all the time they need and just not go if they don't get the numbers.  The defenders have to flashform a counter in a fraction of that time to be effective, it just isn't generally going to happen.  If they don't get the numbers, they just get shit on.
---
&gt;How easy is it to find a Corp that will take in new players?
---
Join this one. Best thing that a new player can do (but don't be one of the people who stays forever, stick around for a while, get a feel for the game and what you like doing in it, and then move on to some other group which specializes in what you enjoy doing). Should take just a day or two to get approved for an interview, then if you queue for an interview every time you're logged in (waiting for whichever PO is online to call your name for an interview), it'll probably be within a few days, depending on time zone. [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Applying\_to\_EVE\_University](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Applying_to_EVE_University)
---
&gt;Any guides I should read up on or videos I should watch?
---
That corp that I linked you to? We have those. Some of the stuff on the wiki (particularly ship fittings) is a few patches behind the current, but the basic concepts are sound and that stuff will be much easier to update once the wiki software update currently being worked on goes through.

And, the most important tip of all:
---
Do NOT pay attention r/Eve. It's full of people who enjoy complaining and haven't played in years.
---
A couple of friends and ex-WH people I know have started a new player friendly corp called Dark Venture Corporation. They have about 200 chars in corp (no idea how many are actual people but I think the % is quite high).
---
Unless you own the pocos it's not worth to buy unless you need like one thing. Such as my case I need lava world stuff so I buy that but I make a lot of different products not just one thing. If your u do buy. Try and buy as low as possible by getting p0 so fresh extracted stuff or p1 so it's a little smaller.
---
One thing is the easier way to go about it. Extract on all but one toon and factory world that last toon. Preferably the dedicated pi guy that won't ever leave system so you can always fill your factories. The shorter the cycles the more resources you get. 
---
I realize some of this is jubberish p0 to p4 is the planet products p0 being fresh extracted p4 being stuff like broadcast nodes level. Pocos are the customs office the thing you warp to.

---
Eve jobs, but shameless plug Dead Star Syndicate is looking for USTZ pvpers
---
My understanding of it was that they had lost too much DPS from the fort's bombs and web to effectively fight the DNIs, hence why they didn't engage it after the fort died.
---
Pretty good second hand account as well.
---
Corps in eve are incredibly hard to kill completely.
---
Groups in wormholes go through evictions(having everything destroyed and thier home burned to the ground) and still rebuild. Corps survive having directors turn traitor and steal all the corp's assets.
---
As long as there is still leadership, a corp can rebuild
---
Wormhole Society is very active with PvP and PvE activities.

That was one of the greatest things ever to read in this subreddit.  I may have it saved.  Yeah Eve is hardcore but in a different way. I played Minecraft on a vanilla survival server for years before Eve.  Eve is hardcore in that the primary way to PVP, that being exploding ships, results on the ships being lost forever.  Kind of like dinos in ark.  Eve is not hardcore where you can get bulldozed over overnight when you're not logged in.  I would say the hardest part about Eve that distinguishes it from the other two games is a difficulty in obtaining and holding space of your own. The other two games don't really have a mechanic for controlling territory. You just squat and build.  Also the meta - politics, spying, ect, are just as important in Eve as actually undocking and fighting. Just a truly unique game and I love it!

Check Op.Sec.. I think that's them. Wrong Hole alliance... maybe.

---
Agree but only for battleships and battlecruisers.
---
why should you be guaranteed a kill on someone who can't fight back, while being able to disengage at will when an actual defense shows up?
---
Corps die from the inside. Outside attacks 99% of the time on a decent PvP corp just make the corp stronger. Structures can die, though.
---
Damn, so simple... yet logical. I like.

And even if you actually have paranoia this does not mean that they are not all out to get you.

Even in the short term you need support skills as well as skills for fitting specific weapons systems. It doesn't make sense to train a small turret or launcher to T2 without also building up the requisite gunnery or missile supports. And keep in mind that the difference between Small *X* Turret IV and Small *X* Turret V is 80% of the total skillpoints to T2. It makes no sense not to cross train.

At that point a mining rokh is faster. And safer

Advanced Algebra level 0. (looks like it was injected but not evolved).

---
Theorycrafting level 2.  
---
Weed level 5.

Weed specialization level 5.  
---
Tactical Bullshit Reconfiguration level 2.  
---
Verdict: Despite a very good deal of SP invested in weed-related skills, it is a bait post.
---
A rather short man approaches you in business attire. He speaks with a slight but noticeable Scandinavian accent, and introduces himself as Sveinn Kjarval, a member of the CCP known as 'Guard'. He holds out his hand, expecting a handshake, but as his fingers close around your hand, he pulls you close with inhuman strength, his grip crushing your fingers. Suddenly, the front of his torso opens up, revealing a huge gaping mouth lined with teeth and dripping with fluids into which you are being pulled. Your last thought as you are eaten alive is "but I thought you couldn't mimic CCP"
---
Congratulations, you just figured out why highsec mining is worthless and why the people that engage in it are, without exception, sub-75 IQ mongoloids.

---
EVE was always "pay to win", from the moment CCP allowed players to trade characters.

My path to wealth was through training up chars to run "isktars" in provi, in the end i was grinding with 6 chars at once, then an inty or cloaky hauler to seed a null market with high value low m3 goods like implants etc, then a JF and then buy orders on mission loot, salvage and minerals at jita buy -10% and sell orders on any and everything that moved. I eventually made spreadsheets to compare (gross margin x avg daily sales)/m3 to work out the most profitable items to ship and by the time i got bored and won eve i was moving 4 JF loads per day. Then my alliance got roflstomped and joined goons and it was a good time to stop logging in. 
---
By the end i was making between 5 and 10b a day, and i was only supplying one of the smaller alliance hubs and a bit in provi, if you put the time and thought in isk is everywhere in eve, but not everyone wants to play that way.
---
Anyway just kinda talking to myself about old times.
---
Good luck.

Using the most vocal of literally any movement as a standard is objectively dishonest.

---
What are you 12?
---
&gt;Or alternatively just solo run missions in highsec
---
whoa
---
NA 9PM on a sunday has been the most active time for eve specially ustz. We can now concur looking at op picture eve is dead. /s
---
I think it's actually not a response fleet saving capitals from mining or ratting, but rather the opposite one.
---
Welcome to eve here are some lists. Tipical.
---
Chaos is a ladder
---
No I apologize.
---
While info of ship actions are server-sided, effect displaying is on client. There's nothing to guarantee some people, including FC, could actually see it.
---
RIP Duality.
---
Share the famous all your dps is void Astero fit please
---
Most of the Hammerhead's HP is in its 0%-resist structure. Most of the Hornet's HP is in its shields, which are both resistant to non-EM damage and regenerate when not being beat on. The damage output is a little lower but there's also the matter of damage type; against armor-tanked or T2 Minmatar ships, or non-Gallente ships, the Kinetic damage will be more effective than the Thermal.
---
you found a dwarf from WoW Classic
---
I make 350m/hr In a Cruiser
---
Small scale PvP in Eve ? No supers being dropped? Wtf
---
Worked for goons.
---
They even made a fake rental application site that was the same as the real rental application site.
---
well i thought it'd be a good time to gate some secondary alts and came into a 20 man gatecamp and a 5 man gatecamp in less than 30 min so
---
Why post if you won't commit my dear friend?
---
You know, if this is the result of CCP dumping money into side projects for 10 years maybe it was worth it all along
---
Isk isn't that hard to come by.
---
It's mainly that a lot of people talk up shit is making as actually being really good. Then you do it and make nothing because people have shit accounting skills
---
Weird. It's almost like all the students who are back at their various schools have something other to do. Like maybe study, work or heaven forbid... Getting a good nights sleep..
---
Because I can, why else?
---
Traditionally the OP posts clues about how to extract the information they're presenting from a picture they post, but this poster decided to leave us a riddle instead. Too bad many people don't like riddles and this will just get downvoted and forgotten.
---
Just screams bitterness lol
---
Neat
---
NFL season start.
---
You can doesn't mean you should
---
Same could be said for you replying :3
---
You can't install implants that require omega but you can still make use of them. Same as jump clones (you can only have 1 as alpha, but if you have more you can still jump to them.)
---
Armor does not recharge itself, EMP damage is nice though
---
Stukas is very high skill requirement (not SP, but skill and experience) fleet. That's why you won't usually see junior FCs doing these fleets. If your FC is experienced and on point and you have competent booshers, capitals don't work that well. Even for T3D and AFs you can get rektd by boming runs with booshing but this also requires a lot of practice and skill to do. Dying to titans depends on luck and experience and skill of the FC.
---
The problem usually is - you form a goku/stuka fleet for lets say 30mins with maybe a one or two pre-pings and you get 150-250 man fleet... The response fleet is basically made up from people who can drop what they are doing and login in the next 5 minutes or so otherwise its too late. Unless its a real prime time (like 20:00 EVE time on Sunday), you won't get a 200 man AF/T3D fleet in like 5 minutes... Thus usually people go for capitals...
---
I sadly can't link the specific passage as the old website is gone, but up until about 2016 one of the spectre guidelines was no structure bashes under any circumstances. 
---
I might misremember though, and you'll definitely know better than me. And that stuff went out the window anyways in wwb.
---
Yes yes you understand!
---
I do understand, now stop replying 😹
---
Big thonk
---
Why? I am committing :D
---
Oh, nice. But not thinking this through enough. Allow ships to get damaged if they bump another ship causing damage. Create another insurance product based on fixing such damage. Have different categories of damage such as scratch, dent ... to totaled. Allow Concord to pull over and impound your ship if it is not space worthy. Finally require all pilots to carry such insurance. (Spacecraft damage insurance not required or deeply discounted for most Minmatar ships.)
---
Yes, you are, but you won’t win lol
---
Because there using 4 accounts?
---
High comorbidity with renal failure
---
Not winning doesn't mean I shouldn't commit, maybe I would learn something at the end anyway
---
You will learn that others are much more capable at killing time by holding useless conversations
---
I'm not mad at them. Very deliberately stay out of WHs when possible, myself, so not much interaction with them. Just pointing out the irony. Complaining about unfairness while being HK is kind of... lol
---
I know I know my 10 minutes old friend, but I don't have to be. Here the logic is simple, you don't have to be the most capable at eating in order to eat
---
Well yeah right thats not happening in this case. even with this factors, years back, eve has not been so low.
---
True. But if someone’s performing a task better than you then there’s little reason for you to stag
---
So I should end up in hunger if someone else eats better? There's always the bigger potato
---
I mean, it’d be an efficient population control
---
Not the best one at that
---
Obviously getting connected to the chat server is a top priority.
---
Not what you asked but... Eveonline is a dead section on twitch, it is extremely niche game, generally very un-entertaing to watch and hard to understand what is going on if you don't play the game. People will watch you mainly to snipe you or because of your personality. If it is latter then you might as well do the just chatting section.
---
But it doesn’t have to be the best, it just has to work
---
Yes yes you get it you get it
---
Get help 😹 we’ve been at this for more than 3 minutes
---
I'm in the bus, so it's not the worst thing to do while I wait
---
Same, this is uncanny
---
HAPPY CAKE DAY!
---
Also yes I strongly suggest contacting Garric Shadowbane
---
Maybe, but not the most at that.
---
True, true
---
Indeed
---
You’re running out of things to say
---
I feel that the saying should be changed to "fit xx number of ships and undock" When I was brand new to the game I had absolutely no idea what was going on. Whether I was flying alone, in a small gang or fleet I was lost. It was the act of undocking that taught me the most about the ships I flew, in any role.
---
Either way attempting to chastise someone who actually undocked and did something in this game is not needed.
---
I couldn't of. I'm still in a queue.
---
That would be horrible. Imagine a logi fleet with that kind of buffer. Would also increase shield boost amounts? Armor reps? Shield and armor transfers? You'd have to.
---
Same tbh
---
huh interesting to find out most in-game characters are male, i thought it was at least even. mostly men online roleplaying girls doesn't apply to eve after all.
---
Because I reached my destination
---
Wonderful
---
The video is literally irrelevant, as I said, it only affected half my fleet including me.
---
MY POWER GROWS WITH EVERY RESPONSE, yes yesssssssss SHARE YOUR HATRED IN TYPED CHARACTERS!!
---
Hk is kind of... what? I wonder what you actually know. 
---
Usually hk evictions are of russian corps - of which hk and rus wh corps have had an endless feud (and the ones within the last year all participated in the rage eviction, so that's not a surprise),
---
Astounding
---
Brilliant
---
Amazing
---
Marvellous

Fascinating
---
TFW people think college kids are playing this
---
Stupendous
---
Well, it can all be done with a Tristan droneboat and you earn up to 1 mio per site... but... sometimes i catch myself doing this shit... only for wasting some time and listen to explosion sounds in space ;-)))
---
Yeah, there was no boson spoolup from my POV, that’s why we died.
---
i quite well know how it works and i find it ridiculous and becoming quite stale.  For a little while T3Cs were used instead of bomber fleets, but rarely now.
---
black ops BS are pretty much only good now for bridging fleets and lighting cynos.  why risk a 1.2b hull when you can get the same dps from a 40m hull?
---
Stunning (Stupendous was new to me thank you)
---
Stupefying (np)
---
don't drink and write
---
Okay it got stale thanks for the short conversation
---
I don't drink period
---
Stukas do not use any of the advantages that covert ships have. This thread is about stukas, not hotdrop bombers.
---
I just got off a 12 hours straight binge which ended when I got blown up by ''surprise'' NPCs in a WH data site...
---
I win
---
Check your graphics settings, I had missing jump portal animation some time ago, I think it was due switching from high to potato mode and back to high and something didn't switch back up.
---
Congratulations
---
Yeah it wasn’t my graphical settings - they were set up correctly. I could see all other on grid effects. It was literally a bug.
---
But that doesn't affect the rest of the math why focus on it?
---
No, but it's like wormhole systems, but also not a wormholeor something.
---
Not quite sure.
---
I'm not. Just a different point of view.
---
Liar.
---
You mean when they were being paraded around like the majority?
---
According to Fozzie it is a shattered wormhole, yes

No ones guaranteeing anything did you even read? I said MJD ships only which means bs and bc which means plenty of time to catch it.. and if this is a null cry post I'm not a miner hunter I solo bs bc and cruiser. Frigs are for pusses

I let those members of my corp who are in college know they shouldn't be playing.. Thanks for letting me know.

You don’t give us any reference, you jack wagon! ‘Previous post’ in what fucking context?

Don’t assume everybody knows / sees / hears what you do just because it’s in front of your face.

there was 26k yesterday evening EU time..... so what's your problem? now its monday morning...
---
Isnt it in the PI screen?
---
You can, but it's wildly unresponsive.
---
We brought Kiki's the time before too, but you still brought a doctrine with no application. Sorry you can't learn :)
---
Also, yeah, I think I would know how it went down..since I run SF..
---
For him it was still sunday 9PM
---
The defending fleet basically fucked off and didn't stop anyone from looting so why wouldn't we? Bunch of random NPSI pilots got free ships after their Kiki's had been blown up anyway, so it's free SRP :)
---
Thanks for ur input. Orca it is and I guess by the time I will be able to fly anything bigger things will change so its a topic for another time
---
you know 26k for a sunday evening is low right?
---
You’re going to be able to do everything an Alpha can. All Omega features will not be available.
---
You can’t fly Omega-required ships, you won’t be able to run Omega-required modules.
---
Docking is going to be possible in any stations you have docking rights to.

I'm gonna use that.
---
I'm not 100% sure, since that was just about when I started taking part in SF's leadership. I don't recall that rule being changed, but yeah, we've allowed it for a long time now - as long as a fight was guaranteed since timers/structures is obv aids, and as long as it wasn't obviously personal army kind of stuff.
---
How can people not tell that this is satire?
---
Whats the new part?
---
😂🤣
---
Why Germans?
---
and you think if they erase Blackout the numbers will be okay again?
---
Yes I keep hearing about joining a bigger corp and I understand why. Its just that its repelling in real life, and I am a bit sceptical about it in EVE. I think I want to learn a bit more, grab a bit more SP so I do not roleplay ameba or something else that goes with a flow in whichever way corp wants me to go. I dont need handouts, or noob treatment. And since I am buying a bit of ISK for start (money makes money and this game is a bit like Forex) it makes the game more pleasant. 
---
Thanks for your pointers though, very helpful.
---
Holy hell did you just quote you KDR. Are we playing the same game? 
---
I don't like calling out someone for their way of playing the game but flying around in DED/Abyssal/blinged out T3Cs and pirate ships killing T1 shit and ratters doesn't make even a "kdr" like that look impressive.
---
WTF? are you high? they are as simple as killing a poco, max time to hit next timer, 1 day 17 hours,  single ship can kill them with ease.
---
sounds like fun
---
Idk, high blood pressure maybe?
---
what lmao? you just orbit and press f1, literally no other skill needed except "how to approach anchor 101"
---
seems only americans can't adapt the changes...
---
For those who are unaware, he’s referring to [this post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/d1hswq/proof_that_eve_is_pay_to_win_calculations_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app). It looks like you had some wonky math issues and people were pointing that out because of what you were trying to argue. 
---
Honestly though, no Eve players aren’t that angry! It’s really hard to understand tone and meaning from typed words. Reddit is usually everyone’s freebie to be shitlords. In game they can do the same too, but it’s easy on Reddit because of anonymity. 
---
Try going to an Eve meet, you’ll meet the friendliest bunch of nerds! Everyone is awesome and is willing to share a drink with you and talk about Eve.
---
No. Second previous post is proof.
---
i would gatekeep thera from being a wh system  
---
but there are no gates to keep
---
Waaah my isk printing machine isnt 100% safe anymore, instead of doing something else like contributing to the eve economy im gonna cry on reddit

I guess some of them not log in to protest, but Blackout will last for ages no matter what they do

anyway you can do whatever you want just you can't play afk

Satire has a purpose, this is just shit

The purpose of this one seems to be satirising the flawed maths of people who claim eve is p2w? It's evidently absurd, so I'm thinking satire.

The point is usually to save the tackled ships (usually one or several rorquals). Also killing 12b worth of a stuka fleet is worth undocking for me.

ouch!

Hands down, best comment I have read today
---
Should've tried to scam the GM, thenbyoud truly be the eve player.
---
The main problem is that it made everything that was boring more time consuming. 
---
Want to make ISK, that is now harder, you will lose more ratting/mining ships hurting your income.
---
Traveling around as a fleet, FC has to assume every system is full so, align fleet warp every system.
---
Hunting, cannot skip empty systems since you don't know they are empty. Making the already hard and slow part of solo/small gang hunting even slower.
---
This makes people feel way less likely to log in. Couple that with the traditional slowdown over summer, the launch of classic WoW and quite some people will have gone to winning Eve part/full time. The cyno changes will be straw which breaks the camels back imho.
---
Each drake applied around 1k per volly with 1 tp. we had more than enough numbers to volly through kikis, in an ideal situation we would have had rapid lights or a diffrent ship all together  however I expect to have to actually fight the kikis not chase them around grid for 90 mins. 
---
source : FC's the drakes
---
Nope, it to late. Even if you patch the leak in the swimming pool, getting the water back in is another matter entirely. Adding to that they are busy drilling a second hole in the cyno changes, which will lead to lots of capital accounts going unsubbed.
---
OP is a troll. Look at his previous posts on other gaming subs. Y'all got baited in a free post.
---
Ok cool now forget it exists
---
I wish there were eve meets nearby
---
Ima down vote for the bad bait.
---
or some eve dude with too much time. paging A3sir or however you spell it
---
Onto -100 karma and beyond!
---
&gt; league_of_legends_is_copy_of_dota_2_tested_and
---
yeah, that is obvious bait, it should refer to dota 1
---
 True as it can be
---
if you listen "Fanfest Home - Fireside chat with CCP Hellmar and CCP Burger" on youtube, Hellmar states that capital era of EVE will end, asset safety will also end, titans will very rare again, etc.  they will turn the universe upside down. they also want changes in trust systems so more oppurtunities for traitors to destroy big alliances.  they think in big and invest in the future, so i don't think they will turn back. i guess they want to make EVE to renew and look like how it looked in the beginning, where big ships and billionairs were rare. to be honest i like this changes. it was a nonsense that usual people were ratting in capitals.
---
but they do use covert cynos to move around undetected
---
I was talking about the PvE side of it, in PvP you pretty much expect to lose the ship, but in PvE you typically don't. Otherwise it would give negative ISK/hr. My main point though was the measurement of risk in terms how how many hours you'd have to grind to make the ISK back, because that's what you "lose" when you're killed while ratting.
---
Carrier ratters are not piloting 3-4 a time because they'd lose fighters to rats so fast thy would probably have negative ISK/hr. I don't know if you have carrier-ratted (after they changed drones to fighters ages ago) but for most people 1 toon is enough, others might be able to do 2 without losing too many fighters but I don't think 3 would be feasible.
---
Blackout definitely changed things a lot, Last time when I wrote I hadn't considered cynos, which are of course not available in WH's. However, in null it is possible to sneak in a covops to a system, covert cyno in a blops fleet to a deep safe so they are very likely not detected, and then just warp cloaked tackle to a ratting carrier, and get a pretty much guaranteed tackle on it the next time it changes sites since it won't be aligned immediately upon landing on a site. A blops fleet will kill ratting carrier in a couple minutes time so there's very little time for defence fleet to get in unless they are formed in the same system.
---
&gt; Could be a good reason for a few null bears to move into wormhole space. This is one of the reasons I've created this post!
---
I agree. I can see the kind of players who is ready to adapt to move from null to WH because of the higher ISK/hr. Most long-time players in null have multiple accounts anyway so WH "requiring" that is no problem.
---
It's not like we'd leave anyway though
---
ItS DuRiNg ThE OfF TiMe

All eve players are stressed out because handling their space job and RL job is just too much.

But then frigates won’t be as oppressive even by a small small small margin.

---
I guess finally the last person got the message too
---
But Hiltard said blackout would kill all the bots!
---
That's not what I'm doing but I'll call things as they're and low effort like undocking shouldn't be rewarded and praised as nothing of substantial was achieved.  
---
Eve should never be game where one is praised for doing the bare minimum i.e. undocking, the issue I take here that op took something like 'fit xx number of ships and undock' which was meant to achieve certain goal and turned it into almost meaningless, that saddens me.  
---
Op did learn something but the lack of vital understanding of what was learnt is lost on op, in his own words op described how his 'mates' will only undock and even burn few jumps for ganking but not for proper fight. 
---
F1 monkeys like easy and guarantied ganks, there's nothing to be taught by pressing F1 nor by hitting approach until you scram something, there's no skill nor knowledge taught or required to do neither.  
---
We need more players going out there trying to do things, being 'Mindless F1 drone' isn't something Eve is missing.  
---
I would had even complimented op had it been full red kb had it been true attempt to learn something new.
---
I understand the lingo, I've been doing PI for awhile but not perfectly.  In other words there's room for improvement regarding my setup.
---
No, they don't.
---
I know, but the joke wouldn't really work that way :(
---
Well at least he does high tiers filaments not in a 6b gila with 5b pod so it's interesting to see that with skill and brain some other way of doing t5 abyssal is possible
---
Like I say, I don't spend much time in WHs, so I don't know them well. But to the wider EVE world - those who don't know them personally - the topic of this thread is pretty much how the world sees HK: rental scamming.
---
do you know what literally means
---
Yes. I was using it ironically.
---
Depends on where you live
---
This is old news find something newer to concern troll over.
---
literally ironically. like how the animation literally ironically lagged or something.
---
Weren't these the guys that played piano with their penises?
---
I agree with you in principle, there is a huge glaring flaw in that though.
---
Players have worked years (pre injector era) in having the ISK, skills and supporting accounts to fly these (super)capital beasts. They want  to use them. If you limit this off you alienate a large part of your most dedicated playerbase. And if those players don't win Eve all together, what limits them to go from 5 accounts to say 2?
---
So while I agree with you in principle, I feel like they cannot "reset" the game without doing a lot of harm to it at the same time. If the new player influx and retention was good then this was a possibility, since it isn't I feel like it's a very risky direction to take.
---
Even my draugur with 6k shield ehp was able to tank 40k damage before dying after the structure went down. You don't understand the difference between having damage and applying damage - even when you got a good warp-in you struggled to kill more than 1-2.
---
They also announced bumping nerf in 2016, so I guess they'll get introduced until 2022, if Tranquility will even be online in 3 years.
---
Stop shit posting and just go away already.

I mostly like Thera to ship stuff from High Sec to non hi-sec trade hubs.
---
* Have your Thera scout, scout the holes with a low sec (static), if they are not known
---
* See where the other holes lead that are open, see which of your sale stock are in need of replenishing in those destinations in low/null sec.  Put some scouts on the different choke-points on your route.
---
* Buy the traded items from high sec markets or grab them from a nearby stockpile
---
* Ship stuff through high sec to the nearest high sec location. Then put it in a blockade runner, run it into Thera, through low sec.  The holes are almost never camped, and in/out gates are less likely camped due to holes not always being in low sec constellations with high traffic.
---
* Prepare a safe-spot in Thera near the LS WH and one near the WH with your destination, due to the fact that you do not want to sit on the Thera WH when coming from LS, and you wont have enough CAP to warp to a safe near the WH to your trade destination.
---
* Sit in the safe near the first WH until you have decent CAP and start the long warp to a safe near the WH to your trade destination.
---
* When you have decent CAP again, jump the WH into LOW/NULL from Thera, so you can microwarp/cloack out from it ASAP.
---
* When moving bigger items, use an orca fit with a high end MWD and a cloack, plus an higgs anchor. Most holes into Thera can sustain enormous mass and with the anchor your warp threshold is very low.
---
Very informative video Suit. Now @everyone forget Thera exists, thank
---
I'm not so sure...
---
The ADC gives you amazing resistance for a short period and then goes on a cooldown, it's part of why the Heavy assault cruisers are so popular in big fleets
---
Oh. Eh. If you pay 30b to someone for a wormhole that doesn't exist, you're probably insane. The ns rentals are all legit, but hk  never will, sell or rent wormholes.

I loved that ship, a few tracktors and slavage... Nice ISK.
---
How are you already playing this?
---
I registered for alpha but never recieved any notification nor find any download link...
---
I agree it is a risky direction, but from CCP-s viewpoint: there is around half a million people trying EVE every year. And most of them not playing longer than a few days. Some play a bit more and realise that he can't do so much impact, even if he having friends, because some supermacy alliance can do what they want and erease anything, etc. So new guys can choose to suffer or join a big alliance. All of my friends were abandoned EVE at the beginning becuase of that and because they saw they can't make inpact, can't catch up to vets, etc. CCP plan is to make newbies easier, and vets harder. I was some alliance in the past years, it was like: apply to an alliance corp without knowing anybody, go down nullsec and PVE in peace, sometimes you got a ship where you have to press F1 in a big blob fleet. Everything is automatic, people are faceless like in a big company.  There was no thrill because the eyes could see anyone coming to your space on local and you docked up before they reach. Time passing, people making big money, ratting in carriers, nothing happening. Sometimes a bigger allience comes, then people moving over and doing the same stuff again. It was all about stockpiling money for years. People just became so rich and the life was so simple. And the whole thing not needed any trust. And EVE is used to be about trust, traitors, dark depth space (for me at least). People can fly big ships in the future, but they have to be much more organized than before. And they will have to know and help each other much more. I think CCP wants to make much more oppurtunities to smaller organizations, and making it more harder to organize and manage big alliances. They making the game to be less faceless. They just need to make some small changes in asset-safety (aka more oppurtunity for traitors/thiefs) and that is alone would be a huge impact on them. They just introduce some new NPC's and people can't mine/rat half-AFK in safety, they have to organize/manage their things to do in space much more. These two things alone would tear apart big alliances. And they also want a changing non static resource redistribution. This also means CCP want to see smaller, more mobile and more trust-converging organizations in New Eden.

Honestly this project is looking great, only heard positive things from testers so.

Exactly this ;)

It s horrible to lose time scanning empty system, before you just look local and jump to another. And system are more empty now so it get worse.

Because there's no gameplay between highsec l3s in a drake and 100 man stuka fleets . . .

Sadly with cyno changes we're quickly going this way.

Accurately booshing bubbles onto a booshing fleet is uhhh... Not realistic?

I’m not saying you’re not right but I’m not auditing everything I come across on the internet [and I’m not saying it wouldn’t be a good idea]. I respond in good faith [well, it is EVE...], I’m not trying to make it a day job.

Boo hoo I don't wanna do the necessary work for living in a wormhole, I hate PVP because it triggers my special snowflake anxiety, now you evil NPSI and nullseccers come to evict me for having something I don't deserve keeping.

You lost your hole primarily because you presented yourself as a decent loot piñata, without having the resources to effectively defend it. Not because of blackout or any other sad excuse that you made up to ease your anxiety.

Bubbles are obviously not useful in this scenario, I don't know why you even bring it up. My point is, if you have a viable counter (like T3D/AF as suggested) and use booshers too, their booshing advantage is no longer an actual advantage.
---
I troll for fun, yes, no intention to make anyone angry though
---
&gt; Players have worked years (pre injector era) in having the ISK, skills and supporting accounts to fly these (super)capital beasts. They want to use them. If you limit this off you alienate a large part of your most dedicated playerbase.
---
We already know what happens when they do nothing. The heat death of serenity should be where you look to.
---
Lol haha HK scams are older than most Fortnite players
---
How are you supposed to hold them down if you can't bubble them or consistently stay on top of them?
---
What kind of situation would you use a recon for that in the current meta? Not trying to troll, I'm genuinely curious lol
---
It really sounds like you're just trying to be upset about this here. Very few of these are problems that you should be running into, and it sounds like your alliance sucks or you're just not renting a moon or something.
---
Also how slow are you going to make 60m/hr? You should be pulling nearly 20m ticks for 120m/hr... and maybe it's just me but I don't find getting escalations all that difficult, I don't care to run them so I just hand them out to my line members too.
---
Also I think that incursions, abyssals and L4 blitzing all kinda need to be toned back. There's almost no risk involved with any of those.

I wouldn't mind balancing changings before or alongside booshing changes. But just because one thing is op doesn't automatically mean another isn't too, right?
---
Keres longpoints/-scrams and/or Alpha-fire? Sprinkling painters/longwebs into the fleetcomp as desired to increase effectiveness, obv.
---
You have to keep up with boosh-repositioning until you get superior booshing power though. That's where the homefield advantage might actually help; your booshers can more easily/quickly reship as they die, unlike the attackers.

Direct answer to your question:  
---
**1)** *The more you hide, the less attractive your PvP/stream is*. You can leave your modules, capacitor and such on stream because people will do their worst regardless of what you show and they\`ll either be very good at predicting what state your ship is in **OR** they\`ll be too bad to make any good decisions based on your capacitor % (i saw like streamers lose 4\~ battleships total for the last year thanks to "capacitor sniping" but really... that ***bhaalgorn*** you engaged 2 minutes ago probably has *3-4 NOSF/Neut* on him and he isn\`t going to stop sucking/neuting your cap regardless of your stream and probably he has some friends that don\`t need to look at the stream to warp to him)...  
---
**2)** *Hide overview or manage it in a way to show only hostile targets* and quickly switch\`n\`hide it if you going to warp off to something.  Hide destinations in top-left (blur it enough so nothing can be seen).  
---
**3)** *Try to pass jumpgates very quickly,* don\`t click on the gate so everyone sees destination, do it quickly (especially if you are mega paranoid about "le hunters" that going to stop their mass rorqual management to hunt you down).  
---
**4)**  ***Be on the move***, do not drag your fights and attempt to find them in the systems further away from your last PvP encounter, this will ensure hunters will get bored chasing you.
---
Know this: IF someone wants to snipe you he will do so anyways, but you can always turn the tables if you REALLY want to.
---
Random advice:  
---
Viewers as general care about PEWS and after a while you\`ll grow audience that will come to watch YOU, please be so kind to:
---
1. Play some music in the background (if you want inspiration, or at the very least approximate idea - go on YT and watch dude named  "worstplayerever", he is from russia, but his choice of music for this game is decent).
---
2. Try to keep your language clean, do not get provoked into usage of bad/negative words because they choose your audience and make your face...
---
3. OPTIONAL: Get some decent mic  \*(\****Samson Go Mic*** *is a decent quality beginner\`s mic and build your way to something better, like AT2020 or Shure SM7b after a while*) and try streaming at **1080p**, pews are born to be colorful and beautiful - don\`t take that away from them.

You dont need to hold them down, just force them off grid.

Yeah that doesn't negate my point at all.
---
Stukas that MJD and bail = no stukas killing their target = defense fleet success.
---
The mission objective shouldn't default to "obliterate the enemy fleet".
---
Not at this point, too many half-assed changes in a row followed by hilmar saying how they are all awesome and generating more content then ever, when literally every single graph shows the opposite has really destroyed what little trust CCP had left with the  player base. At this point he could cancel the cyno changes, reverse blackout and swear to never do a drifter like event again and no one would believe him, and with good reason.
---
&gt;And most of them not playing longer than a few days. 
---
So why are they flushing 10k paying long term accounts down the toilet on the insanely LOW chance they suddenly, magically start convincing large numbers of new players to stick around?

---
Data sites suck
---
snakes for long web loki are a no brainer imo and crystals would boost your tank but theres always the question if its worth it to you 
---
if you are just worried about SP just run 2 +3 implants for whatever attribute your current skill needs to save on cost
---
You are right. But I would ignore those parts which you have to skill either way. So doesnt matter the turret type one would take, you still have to get gunnery skills. If i have to skill them either way, I dont take them into account. If you would focus on missiles and have those as your sole weapon system, you wouldnt play on machariel or megatron - but you could miss being able to fly more effective ships for those types of activities.
---
The question of what turret type is worth focusing first in the long run was meant to get idea from what player would benefit the most while progressing from some hisec/lowsec play (so learning the game via incursions, invasions, fw) toward some low/null/wh pvp play (so creme de la creme of EVE gameplay - according to some).

Doesn't removal of nullification make gate bubble camping basically uncounterable and protect entire constellations of ratters from being hunted?
---
I bet we could a far better upvote for "Let's remove StanGuy from EvE and Reddit"

I think he means they just have a lot of health
---
Oh u are afraid of losing 100% safe cloaky loki?
---
Well yes and no.             
---
A single guy that will be able to move in a ship with cover cyno can negate this aspect of gatecamping as he can bring more ships at any point.                   
---
Gates are not camped 23/7 so moving alt at some strange TZ or bringing a gang to seed a covert cyno alt is a thing you can do.
---
I think CCP doesnt care about player ideas how game could work.
---
I wish I could pay just $150 for that Caedes...
---
Why use loki?        
---
Want to seed covert cyno in some area - bring 20 bombers ... crash the gate and one of them will manage to get in and move to safe.
---
Maybe. Not the worst idea.
---
yep, it's fit and kill from video. We think to change this setup for little more effective rr %)

Just remember the Interdiction nullifier reduces your subwarp speed and agility by a not inconsiderable amount.

Depends on what you want to do. You can't really destroy a well set corp just by brute force. Too much effort for too little reward. However someone flipping the corporate bank accounts, or seizing materiel might do the trick.

Or you know, rather than using all three rig slots to make the ship type not complete cancer, maybe look to rework warp speeds?  Especially in a game where 99% of systems are empty.
---
how dare you let your fleet members without ship pick something from the free loot in space you non neutral monster
---
you should have podded them and left the hole tbqh fam
---
Imagine the amount of bubble fucked gates. The tedium would be out of this galaxy. Perhaps a limit on the amount of anchorable bubbles that could be placed around a gate would be a good way to meet this idea half way. I think we have all had to slow boat through those massive stacks at one point
---
Delay kills your ability to interact with chat.
---
That’s funny considering they ban the same wave of bots every month.
---
If CCP had a mapping system that was utter garbage I wouldn’t be too broken up about this idea.
---
Having Nullification is the only reason why ppl still do DED site escalations. Take nullifications away and you basically killed the rest of PvE in null.
---
For example. If you see a tengu/loki/proteus on d ... unless he's hunting, chance he's a DED runner. Knowing nullification is gone, you don't even have to hunt him in the system. Best scenario is, there are only 2 gates ... So bring a handful ppl, wait on the outside of both gates until he finishs and leaves. No Nullification means he either makes it back to the gate or stays uncloaked. But every group that is at least a bit experienced, knows how to uncloak people and take them down no matter if he jumps back or not ... boom you got your free loot. At the end ... you make t3's totally useless. You can take a stratios from there on or basically every HAC where you put a stupid cloak on if you want.
---
And even if you don't camp a gate ... bubbling up your gates with like 10 bubbles will annoy the shit out of everyone, if a whole constellation is full of those, jump after jump.
---
I don't fight with my Legion nullified if i can avoid it. It's a crippling weakness when its equipped. And nulli T3Cs are not 100% safe they are pretty easy to decloak before warping off actually that's why they reduce your agility so much.
---
Mighty beans are recruiting
---
And how pre tell are you going to get this cloaky cyno past the gate camps?
---
I would agree for battleships. Holy fuck are those poor fuckers so damn slow.
---
Yeah yeah.. another half baked CCP promise. I’m sure they’ll do this right after shield slaves and logi killmails. 
---

Well the average login on a Saturday EU prime (heaviest EVE tz) was down to 25-30k long before blackout.
---
It was at its best 55-65k well before the fatal patches that deployed Citadels and rorqual-Moonmining in late 2015/early 2016. So all the narratives that blackout killed the game from people noe not being able to multibox-afk-farm anymore is heavily biased bullshit.
---
Also if it takes you an hour to go 20 jumps...
---
well i stayed around on reddit to see weather or not to try this game later. cause maybe i just had bad luck on start
---
Hell no, i did not say that, now did i?
---
I see no issue with this.      
---
Potential downside is that all those players that put up drag bubbles will lose their gameplay.             
---
Maybe instead of "on grid" we can go to &lt;100km from gate.
---
Imo the problem is that the map is too big actually.
---
Higher warp speed means less chance to escape a gank. This is why some ship equip hyperspatial rigs to gank "faster"
---
Like someone pointed out no anchorable bubbles on gate.      
---
But for me no anchorable bubbles &lt;100km from the gate.

This will remove safe gameplay for all the people involved in nullified ships.

I agree with that.

This isn’t the most terrible idea in the world of gates aren’t being bubblefucked.

So you want to be safe and engage only when you can win.

Gila is the most comparable to the old VNI.

we had the same 2 weeks ago.  
---
Just no.
---
This would be funny if you weren't a goon. We know why you want nullification removed. It's so that people can't penetrate into your ratting territories as easily.
---
While I do not rat much myself, I do see alot of ratters around. Most people that were looking for a "direct" VNI replacement went with the Myrm, which offers a way more comfortable tank --&gt; higher survivability chances/ faster warp off.  Apart from that, with the blackout in general you see a) alot less ratters and b) alot less small ships. Some Vexors for beginners here and there but apart from that its Myrms Domis and the random praxis here and there (which I suppose would work decently well for ratting as well as anti-gank defense).  
---
The more expensive options would be either a Gila or a Rattle I suppose, but I don't see those as direct VNI replacements, sinc their pricetag is significantly higher. However they murder any kind of PVE content so I could see where they still supply decent ticks (especially if you are playing safe and doing DED's)
---
Ok so you fought the gate camp. There are now no ratters around because it took you longer than a few seconds to get ships through the gamp. Grats on the gnosis kill.

Yea you would need like 10-20 ceptors to decloak&amp;point loki.

You are way off on what happened in 3GX, that was a timer for the H-GK TCU that Brapteor formed for looking to go haze toasters, however he lost track of the SG legion fleet, thought they were still in Dital, and made an ill-advised jump into 3GX and got slaughtered.  The Provi fleet then stood down and RC and friends went on a toasting rampage and shot the tower.
---
Brap is a some what new FC and that was his 1st time forming machs, 1500 in the middle of the week is rather early for provi though and the numbers weren't on his side, he's learned a valuable lesson for the future.
---
never not post, it is known and teached through generations of Goons
---
so you want to make gatecamping even easyer and make null have less ppl?
---
they removed nulli from dps ceptors and nerfed the align time on cloky/nulli t3c that's enough, there need to be "safe" ways of travel in null whitout having to scan 20 wh's
---
I heard its pvp land there, wahts the meta like?
---
Half the point in intercepters is scouting for the fleet, i don't think we need to have more ways for inties to eat shit while being the hero of the fleet. They would die on gates a lot more straight up, thats not really very productive to the game for a role thats already pretty hard to do well and pretty unforgiving to mistakes
---
That sounds more like you're thinking in corp/alliance/coalition-level.
---
I am talking about solo guys, with nobody backing them up. Now people could say "yes then join a group". But in your way, you would basically exclude one kind of game play, alot of people might find relaxing and satisfying. Doing the sites already puts way more effort in ... not talking about the average 70M VNI, that in most cases might get away anyway. I did a serpentis 6/10 yesterday again, the first in like 6 weeks, and it was stressing. Any moment someone could have combat probed me and landed on top of me even though i was pushing my d-scan every second so hard, the key might have popped of my keyboard ... my relief? when i was done with the site and could get home. If getting home will become as dangerous as doing the site itself, the risk/reward thing won't play out anymore.
---
I have no idea about bridging toons, but it sounds like you need at least 3 toons for that. One bridger, your ded site toon and the cyno ... well with no nullification, already getting the cyno toon into place will be a challlenge. Especially since normal cynoes can only be lit by what again? Recons and Blops? And they are not nullified ...
---
I believe the appropriate resonse is.

I think they counted with this decrease and have some money to survive it for 1-2 years or more. i also think that most of people will slowly come back if they like EVE, because there is no other game like that on the market.  and there are also old players who coming back because of the Blackout and the Chaos Era changes.
---
Impersonating CPP is one of the few things that aren't allowed when it comes to scamming. Though the GM probably appreciated the paranoia and probably found a bit funny.
---
Lol that starts the question . Which other  gamestyle in eve got nerfed that made Null OP and other game style bad ? CCP buffed null and the next part shud have been buffing low or w space . But not ccp we are still in null sec with no idea what to do with the game .
---
Remove asset safety and call it a day lmao
---
WE CANT HEAR YOU
---
You fought the gate camp, moved in alt with covert cyno.        
---
You are now ready for upcoming days.             
---
What is wrong with this?
---
So your fleet will need to fight as you cannot scout so well.      
---
/o\
---
Oof. Not much of that is actually true.  
---
Lasers definately do NOT have the best tracking. Their tracking is actually quite mediocre/bad, but they make up for that by having ludacrious range on their beam tier 2 ammo, and in general really good range coverage even with their short range weapon, pulse lasers. They also are the turret that uses the most energy for shooting, meaning if you get neuted you are gonna have trouble actually shooting your guns. You can also not change your ammotype, meaning you are locked to one type of damage that you deal (em / thermal)  
---
Hybrid Guns with blasters and rails still use some energy, but not as much as the energy turrets. Blasters are increedibly short range and are usually part of a "ram face into enemy - heat the shit out of your guns" scenario. Rails are a pretty balanced gun, having a nice range, decent tracking, and a decent firing rate, with their tier 2 ammo also reaching really far out. Hybrids again are damage locked, so you cannot switch damage type (Hbrids only deal Thermal+ Kinetic Damage).  
---
Which leaves the 2 "variable"  gun types, Projectile guns and missiles.  
---
Both of these will lose raw dps in comparison to e.g. lasers or hybrids with the same range. Simple reason being for these factors is 1: You can switch between ammo/ missiletypes and deal exactly the damage type you need, and 2: none of these use \*any\* cap to be shot, and can be used even when completely neuted dry. Light / heavy missiles are low firing rate long range, while rockets  /  heavy assaults/ torps are short range fast firing speed. The projectile guns are pretty unique, with the autocannons having around the same optimal range as blasters, but comparatively way more fall off range, While artillery guns are designed to deal as much damage as possible with one single shot, but having an insanely low rate of fire, and sacrificing damage per second for this "one shot" mentality  
---
One more thing, since you guys were chatting about the gunnery and missile "support" skills already: Missiles are complete  ***shit*** without the support skills atleast trained to decent levels (the best here is to literally max them out asap), while the guns are a little more forgiving.  
---
So, to answer your question:   
---
There is no "best" gun. Duh. Could have saved myself that entire paragpaph. If you are looking for one gun fits all kinda deal, Id say autocannons. Don't expect them to be perfect in every scenario, though.
---
Even an undocked corvette would be an improvement most of the time tbh :D
---
Probably there usually is. Pi is the king of burn out afaik. It takes the most attention and least interesting. It's almost as bad as mining lol
---
Lol didn't mean to pander just making sure you know what I'm saying lol
---
very nice ! ! ! !! !! ! !! ! ! ! ebic
---
"Same with showing kills in system in game map should be removed."
---
Get a geno set and +5 rof implant, zor’s hypserspeed etc. Or go with snakes for also fun times ))
---
Very interesting. 
---
Eve is just so damn cool that I'm actually mad at myself that took me so long to actually start playing it.   
---
I just know I missed out on a lot of fun stuff but trying to make up for it now :).
---
Yupp sounds about right. Rorq is cool but you can do better things with 15bil.
---
CCP changed nullsec to more group like activity, thats why they should make roaming group activity as well. 
---
You cant focus sandbox multiplayer game on solo mechanics. This game was always based on huge battles.
---
Solo Roaming is too easy, you cant get away from noobs camping the gate? Sorry you should die with honor.
---
what graphs show? decrease in player count and activity. i dont think graphs shows anything about the quality of the game. it's also interesting that player counts are more less in USA than in EU. seems EU players can accept changes better. but what is the real problem for you? EVE is now not comfortable as it was before? you should be happy that there is some new challanges now.
---
and paint
---
SIGNED
---
&gt; Sometimes you jump 20+ systems to try to find some content and in the end you waste 1+ hour just to move around. 
---
I honestly think this is the problem with EVE nowadays. Not that you newbies can't get content instantly, but that you *expect* to get content instantly; that you think content *should be* instantly available.
---
In the olden days (yes, I'm an old fart) we'd grind for a week to get a combat ship, and then gate camp for hours, or do some sort of op that took days of planning, just to land one or two kills, usually ending up losing our own ships in the ensuing brawl. - And not some fancy super-carrier, or some officer-fit-swiped-on-moms-credit-card faction ratter either. Just plain T1 subcap kills. And knowing how much effort went into all this is what made the kill, the loss, and the game itself, awesome.
---
This whole "Fortnite-ification" of EVE is what's ruining it; people logging in and expecting immediate combat with zero planning or effort put in. - Kills mean nothing now. People throw away ships like they are nothing, because with how easy ISK/minerals are to come by now, they literally are nothing. - And when the attention-deficient masses log in, and don't manage to get a dozen blingy kills in the following 30 minutes, they get cranky and come post stupid suggestions on reddit.
---
And CCP is so desperate these days to cling on to players that they are actually starting to listen to this shit.
---
IF THEY NERF SHIPS THEY'LL BREAK LOCAL AGAIN
---
Agreed. Genos get you so much j mileage for T3C fits. And in solo all those other little bonuses go far
---
OTHER AREAS DIDNT GET NERFED THEY JUST GOT FUCKED BY CAPITAL POWER CREEP THAT ALLOWED PRETTY MUCH ENDLESS MONEY PRINTING IN NULL. 
---
BY "BUFFING" OTHER AREAS YOU PROB MEAN THAT IT WOULD BE EASIER TO MAKE MONEY IN THEM. HOW ABOUT NO. GAME HAD AN ISSUE REGARDING THIS AND MAKING IT WORSE DOESNT HELP IT.
---
I think nullification is okay for no/low risk Bubbles like anchorables and Interdictors, but HIC really should stop everything since you put an expensive Ship on the line.
---
I’ve actually never lost one, or even been attacked (run about 40 sites?). One recommendation from hunting others though, l typically travel 30-40km from the landing point of a site and setup my MTU/depot closer to where the sleepers spawn. If I remember I’ll leave a cargo container at the landing point to decloak anyone that jumps into the site
---
Nice cherry pick for you Q&amp;A and you didn't even understand what he put.
---
We used teespring in the past, but this looks like it might be better tbh
---
I dont know what fight you were in but ok.
---
The only reason your Draugur tanked 40k is because of bombs by the forti, once we focused it it only took 10k damage, so once again you make 0 sense.
---
Haha @ "you are mom gay"
---
I'm from the old days... 2008 account. Back to these days I had time to spend doing nothing. Nowadays sometimes I have 2 hours to play eve. And most my time during it it's guess what? Warping around. Moving. 
---
Somethings in eve are not useful. Some "complex" mechanics are just time wasters. Character attributes? Remapping?
---
..you couldn't break my draug even when i got webbed and primed..
---
But nice story &lt;3
---
Even in alpha the game shows great potential, might be the first spin-off I actually play. The only way EVE would work on mobile is simplification.     
---
I'm shocked by how good the alpha is, really excited to see it move forward.
---
I know right? I'm such an asshole for letting everyone take what they want!
---
Before interceptors got nullification, this was the niche of covops frigates.  Worked fine then vOv
---
Oh ur are unhappy about people leaving the game do to krabbing nerf? Now you want to make game "faster". We got another Clown here.
---
THERE'S JUST 10 REPLIES SO FAR TO THIS THREAD AND 4 OF THEM ARE NOT IN CAPS. 
---
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU SHITHEADS
---
Guys...it's a joke. 9p on a Sunday...
---
Well the last thing i need when coming home from work is having to talk to people, but listening to music and doing some things in eve, maybe watching a movie ... 
---
Even if i have 2 toons ... my scout would not be nullified as well ... which just brings me to the point, what are ceptors good for anyway by then? I could take a condor, which by then is basically as good as every 30M ceptor, since it will get trapped in every bubble the same way ... for pure travel, you can go back to shuttles.
---
***Assuming*** the initial hypothesis is correct the maths is flawless
---
Isn't there one in the smithsonian also? Or is it the same one?
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE?
---
So your a fan of having the only counter to gatecamping be “move during odd tz”. Sounds like not much of a counter
---
Interceptors are hardly the only scouting option, only the most braindead.
---
That's really boring though, which just sums up the entire game nowadays.
---
Wow, you're so delusional, this is great.
---
Why i also posted 2 simple ideas :            
---
* bring a gang and fight your way in to seed a covert cyno alt             
---
* bring multiple covert cyno chars and simply overflow the gatecamp. Simply by having more ships than points and moving in various directions using MWD.
---
Or break the camp with some friends, or bypass it via WHs, or run it in a covops, or...
---
Why it wouldn't?
---
I know we are playing capitals online, but once in a while people have to get places and not to light a cyno. Like moving things or subcap fights.
---
Sleepers are dirty liars, and ghost sites tend to explode.
---
Always Google the site if you don't know what it is.
---
I left my ride in Amamake top belt for 5 mins and someone stole my hub caps.
---
You prove  that hunting is too easy if u can just watch movie and fly around in interceptor avoiding danger...
---
Removing nullification would make you use mwd, make safe spots and actually play the game instead of AFK hunting krabs.
---
Burning trough bubble could be a nice adrenaline shoot just like hilmar said about chaos era.
---
Oh no the people who where only playing Eve to krab safely and drop titans on people are leaving what a terrible loss
---
Seems easier to just use a Jump Freighter
---
Yea your right hopefully we get a lot of new people once ccp fixes the stuff for bew players
---
Still a better graph than any graph about your life since the same Jan '19.
---
But game quality goes higher so win in my book.
---
You can only really "sell" a hole if you have personally built ingfrasturucture in it that is connected to the hole and might benefit the seller. Otherwise I'd say you just found a wormhole for someone, which 1) is a thing, Wingspan gets paid decent money just for finding specific holes and 2) pays alot less / up to nothing. Usually it goes the other way around, someone comes to you (if you are a hole "Searcher") and asks you to find a specific hole for him at an agreed price (for example to evict the people inside of that hole); instead of you offering a random empty hole.  
---
If the hole is good (e.g. C2 with NS/C5-6 connection) then theres a chance people will still pay you for an in-location if its empty, to save themselves the hassle and to get into that wanted hole ASAP before anyone else can settle I suppose
---
Why you want delete r/Eve? Just delete TQ and all problems of mankind would be solved.
---
I see the intent, but that's a swing and a miss dawg
---
Dude how else am i going to get my daily dose of static images of ingame ships, t3c's bumping of afk tethered frigates and gloating about it, or people coming back/new to the game asking if it's worth play?ing!?! Without r/eve online where is the community going to congregate? Not in null sec local that's for sure!
---
We will see, we will see.
---
In case you forgot, that wasn't the first time you primed me.
---
And yes, at that point our entire fleet was getting roasted. Good timing too, I had no quick warpout and 10mn isn't the best for aligning.
---
There is no such thing in EVE
---
In friendly space that is true.
---
But you don't need to fight, thats the entire point. The dudes flying inties in smaller groups are the dudes finding the fights like 80% of the time. Having to jump blindly into any gate with your entire fleet or use slow AF cloakies is just gonna make the experience more clunky rather than anything else and the new defacto tackle ship would likely be the Astero instead and inties would be a completely useless class of ships. It would be outshined by the garmur and keres in its tackle uses too in most cases.
---
Ok that hurts......
---
Okay son. which crayon box did you eat today?
---
Uh huh 🙄
---
I guess they never miss huh
---
Naaaah that's EVE 2018. 
---
EVE 2019 is: "MAX PING CTA NEED ALL HANDS GONNA BE A YUUUUUUUGE FIGHT" -&gt; jump 20 gates -&gt; "haha made u form" in local.
---
You fought and beat the camp, you seeded a cyno in the pocket. Later you burn the cyno to kill a couple ratters, maybe you do this twice. They pick up and move to another pocket and now you have to do it all over again. That just sounds like empire building with more steps.
---
Not so unreasonable when you've only got a single gate to camp.
---
I don't know where you got that info from, but blops were never shit, had their use before the blackout, and will now rise in popularity thanks to the cyno change. and... thats about it.
---
With current numbers online it would be like 10-15 gate camps across nullsec.
---
Needs moar war.
---
IT'S 2019 WHY DO I STILL NOT HAVE DIVISIONS/FOLDERS IN MY PERSONAL WALLET EVEN MY REAL LIFE WALLET HAS A FEW LITTLE FLAPS THAT DO THIS
---
Better than the 4-5 i see on average currently. I actually encountered a manned bubble camp the other day. it was a surreal experience.
---
Your sec status gain is directly oriented on what the biggest rat was that you killed in the last 15 minutes.  
---
So the most efficient way is killing atleast 1 BAttleship rat per 15 minute interval.
---
Marauder ain't a pvp ship homie. Never was. Without massive changes, never will be.
---
I find all caps even more unpleasant to read than all lower case.
---
You mean actually having time to get your reps on a target before it welps into a pod... yeah, super frustrating.
---
You go in any c1 c2 or c3 with a HS static.   
---
Tadaaaaa. Thats literally it  
---
i dont really see why you would camp a B274 though. Its a hs entry after all, if i see a camp on a b274 i just turn around and jump out. If your enemy has a brain --&gt; 0% chance of catch
---
Oh i wasn't talking about hunting myself. I was listening to music and watching movies whilst traveling at least where i wanna do the site ... after that i won't watch movies, as i have to watch my screen for at least 1h non-stop and clicking d-scan as if i would stop breathing if i stop pushing it.
---
Besides that burning through bubbles ... i don't need a 1,5B tengu for doing that ... i can take a caracal and probably get the same result out of it ... i either wake up in jita or make 1-2 more jumps before they finally get me. Do i have to lose SP or be 1,5B ISK shorter next to not having completed the site that i actually wanted to do? Yes i could, but i probably won't. Funny enough, that would eventually really get me back into doing sites in a wormhole, my overall work and the risks are far lower.
---
At the end, i still wanna have fun in my game that i play after 10h of RL-work. I am already at the point, where EVE punishes mistakes harder and stresses me more then playing Apex with random idiots... not talking about the fact that due to greater risks, to archive goals, my time commitment rises as well ... for something i could easily have done in 30min, i now have to eagerly prepare and instead of taking one toon i have to take 3, one for scout, one for bait, one for the actual site.
---
Suitonia, i recently roamed Fountain with a Rifter for half a Day and only found:
---
*Ratting Nyx
---
*Ratting Hel
---
*Rorq/20 Procurers and an Onyx
---
*traveling Stiletto
---
*A Hecate chasing me
---
*traveling Tengu
---
*2 Ventures
---
Only managed to get 1 Venture. What did i do wrong?
---
Eve players who voiced 'adapt or die' to many, finally realise do the later.
---
Agreed. This game is too reliant on out of the game tools.
---
High/low/null all your loot is safe if your keep it in a station. 
---
Player built stations have this bullshit mechanic called asset safety. Basically, if your station gets blown up, all your loot gets shipped to the nearest accessible station.
---
You can only truly loose everything if you live in a worm holes since those stations do not have asset safety.
---
Honestly, the only real way to loose a Corp is to mismanagement.
---
If your fit doesn’t need implants for fitting purposes I’d use snakes.
---
If you need more fitting then geno’s
---
If you make null too easy for the hosts to lock down and too difficult for visitors to enter and move through then you make null boring.
---
Nullification is what makes null accessible to the smaller guy.
---
Game is collapsing right now. I dont think they have reason to camp with industry/krabbing reduced to 0.
---
I'm waiting for good quality changes from CCP, current changes are retarded. No point on doing anything if you cant plan your future. Constant nerfing just disabled my skill plan, remap with a fcking yearly coold down.
---
k, what about the last point? the anom respawn time nerf...
---
Hounds are better in pairs for deleting Myrms and Domis.
---
Why deal with the bullshit of going to war when CCP announces some braindead change a few weeks in that forces you to run home and figure out what the fuck is going on.
---
People fight wars when they are stable enough to project power. "Chaos" as envisioned by CCP forces people to hunker down and regain stability.
---
I GET IT, YOU'RE IN HORDE, YOU DON'T LIKE TO THINK MUCH.
---
BUT LOOK AT THE FIRST THREE WORDS OF THIS THREAD. CMON.
---
The snipping tool, it copies the snip to clipboard and is part of Windows.
---
WE CAN'T HEAR YOU
---
Well, unfair comparaison (2 ship instead of 1)
---
if CCP makes one of the areas of the game profitable than the rest everyone will just move to do that one thing... hence why null is so populated...
---
WOULD it matter if YOU did? i QUIT the game and hope you do as well... FOR YOUR OWN GOOD?
---
You're right it wasn't the first time we focused you down, first we popped your bifrost after that terrible Bush.
---
Then you reshipped to the Draugur, we did 1 cycle and instantly swapped because of range not because we couldn't break you, we engaged when you were 70km +. And another Kiki was at 30km at the time so we swapped to him instead.
---
Keep being delusional.
---
U GOT ME THERE M8. I DIDNT EVEN REMEMBER THAT SINCE IT DIDNT SEEM TO MAKE MUCH OF DIFFERENCE.
---
TAKE IT AS PRE-OILING BEFORE COMPLETE ASS FUCK.
---
This is how they change the game right now, they make easy things almost impossible to run solo ;D
---
Reward didnt change, but everything else skyrocket and made many casual people like you to quit. I had the same problem, fun &amp; possibilities changed to obligation &amp; part time job...
---
IF YOU QUIT THE GAME STOP HANGING AROUND /R/EVE THEN. FOR YOUR OWN GOOD???
---
**HAHA GET REKD INIT RENTER RORQS. ELITE BOKOPS PVP**
---
I really miss /r/eve blackout, I would be in support of turning off the subreddit permanently.
---
But it is about making nullsec more demanding not easier.
---
Hahhahaha
---
100% agree with, double the warp speed for all the ship, it s insane the time that we lose while warping. Warping is fucking boring.
---
More warpspeed; more content. Less time lost.
---
So where is the issue?
---
How and why would the large blocks even go to war now. There to busy defending themselves from cloaked lokis and bombers. There is no benefit to them fighting each other.
---
The issue started with the first line of your post, it ended somewhere near the end. I know it’s Monday, but try to come up with some kinda better idea
---
WELL THERE IS THE REASON WHY IT GOT FUCKED. 1 THING IS OP WITH CURRENT META, 5 OTHER THINGS ARE NOT. BUFFING THE OTHER 5 WOULD EVEN INCREASE THE PROBLEM THAT WE ARE TRYING TO FIX.
---
I will search that up :) if I encounter you in a fleet I'll tell you my IGN :)
---
CYNO CHANGES UNCOMING. NULLBEAR SO SALT. GOODBYE UMBRELLA. LOVE
---
UNSUBBED ALL ACCOUNTS! 
---
WILL BE BACK IN OCTOBER.
---
For the win
---
Low warpspeed fuck everybody playstyle.
---
Pve in eve is so boring. 
---
Roaming in null space while finding no target warp after warp it s not fun too. When a game is not fun people are leaving to play something else.
---
If you flair is right, have you seen how providence is terribly empty now?
---
YOU THINK YOU HAVE WON BUT COME BACK 2 MONTHS LATER SINCE YEARS OF YOUR WORK (READ: WASTED LIFE) ARE STILL IN THE GAME AND PROBABLY MANY OF THE PEOPLE IN YOUR SOCIAL BUBBLE AS WELL.
---
YOU CAN RUN BUT YOU CANT HIDE.
---
There's a lot of stuff coming that will make being a new bro (returning bro) a lot of fun!
---
&gt;Enemy thinks it's just another JF cyno
---
Are ppl rly that retarded?
---
No, that's 4 pm Eurotime yesterday.
---
..I had just warped back, and was massively behind the fleet and even got webbed by the loki..and still didn't break :P
---
Remember the NC guy that lost 3 JF in same system to the same guy in the same day?               
---
He got tricked into this each time.
---
&gt; the people who where only playing Eve to krab safely
---
But Sleeper loot number's haven't dropped, so the biggest crabs aren't leaving.
---
I have Raw footage of FC and from myself and, I'll repeat this again, we did only 1 cycle on you and then you were 85-90k away from us so we swapped to Kiki at 30k.
---
Get your facts straight.
---
I don't think that is a fair characterization. If I have two hours to play today I cant really do anything. It takes hours roaming generally to find content. I cant go mine or rat without hours of Intel because I dont know where enemies are. I mean, I can log in and bullshit for two hours, but that's about it.
---
The point is, the only skill you have is exploiting and going after PvE players, yet claim to PvP. It makes you a joke, and no where near an expert on the topic at hand.
---
PvP is when people can fight back, pure and simple. I guess I should stop clubbing the baby seal here and move on.
---
A thing to keep in mind is that a lot of companies let their scammers and bots off because they are paying subscribers. CCP has banned like 50k botters just this year. Even though it's an income loss. They are legit in for the long term quality of the game.    
---
That said always be cautious with all dealings. Never a bag idea to be paranoid.
---
mari is best girl btw
---
There is a war but your side is losing.
---
Delete this post, dont let CCP know.
---
No, so my Loki runs just fine as it is. It has enough room for fitting and I was curious if I can push - or worth pushing (cuz those sets are pretty expensive compared with normal training sets) - its limits even further while also have a better training speed.
---
++ haha. Treat real life like that and you will actually get ahead
---
Only thing “braindead” about it is your analysis
---
I mean just use a real cyno and jump a Rorqual in. Seems just as innocuous. If someone is gonna dumb they gonna dumb either way.
---
It’s a good question, I believe one of the connectors in the back of the capsuleer will provide some kind of nutritious solution that will sustain them.
---
When the pod is ruptured in any way, the pilot is killed and their mind is imprinted on the clone that is awaiting for just that purpose. When they reconnect they ‘wake up’ as a mind in a different body.
---
Can't upvote this enough !
---
If you ever think people aren't that retarded know that someone is. 
---
remember the bait myr no one is going to take the bait oh they took the bait heck i still remember the rooks and kings video on it
---
Hics should have warp scrambling script that has half the range but scrambles rather than just interdicts.
---
Oh well.
---
Cloud-consciousness and Remote Desktop.
---
Yup, it's not as bad as it looks. Can probably do it with like 250m3 of compressed ore if it's got refine!
---
Of course, if it *doesn't* have indy, you're in for a rougher time. And if you're doing flexible routes (like pushx haulers) it means a lot of gating t1 indys to random-ass stations. 
---
My point is it's all *completely unnecessary and benefits nobody.* It doesn't create content, it just makes JF pilots spend like 20 extra minutes a day on grinding vs. on doing what they actually want to do in Eve. The covert cyno option was infinitely preferable on all fronts, in large part b/c it's easy to get a cyno bomber to a station you want, and harder to get a nereus through lowsec. 
---
(ok ok it does actually benefit 1 type of pilot: bait nereus is gonna be a much stronger play now.)

/r/eve should have a weekend of non-Eve content, just to shake things up.
---
We can bitch about other games instead!
---
So you have recon in a lowsec, on a station ... dying to tornados 9 times a day.                
---
Imagine those moongoo prices.
---
I don't see this as any real change. Yeah, it's obvious you're not sending a JF through if you've got a recon, but there's no telling what *is* intended to come through, just like previous cyno's. People should have assumed hostile before, and will assume hostile still now.
---
You also wrote your text as if you got solo'd by a HIC despite linking to a kill of *64 enemies* who had to get together, indicating it's rather the complete opposite of "easy" for the opposing party to catch and kill you. You're using one of the biggest ships in the game to get cheap kills with minimal risk to you; stop acting like you're a victim. :P

I get what you mean, just so you understand  the culture new corps are not charity. We as in pandemic horde, eve uni, brave newbros and many more are here as a rite of passage. This image is still true today:

We do not want to be a charity, we want you to not quit the game. This being rite of passage is so much the case that CCP are talking about straight up sending new players to corporations like ph and eve uni.

Either way if you are ever feeling lost, bored or unsure of what to do next you know where we are.

These arent people, they are just krabs. They dont matter. Less krabs = less isk inflation, god bless the blackout

my "social bubble" migrated to discord, so now the paid chat service known as eve is no longer necessary...
---
Sounds like you're counting logged in accounts rather than players.
---
THEN TAKE BLUEPRINTS IN WONT YOU FUCKING RETARD
---
IMAGINE BUYING SHIPS
---
So we’re suprised that the first weekend WoW Classic was playable is the same weekend that EvE playercount dropped greatly? Im sure those things have nothing todo with eachother. Grr blackout or something....

this account is specifically FOR r/Eve, your point being?

---
As someone who doesn't play Eve, just here cause I love reading about it, can you give me an out of the loop summary or link?
---
Sounds like I'm using the data available to me and if there are less characters in the game, then the game is worse off.
---
I'm not sure what you smoking but I want some of that.
---
GET YOUR FUCKING G SMALL LETTER SOME FUCKING WHERE ELSE, YOU ARE THE CANCER ROTTING THIS GAME INSIDE OUT.
---
If someone running 10 rorqs and plexing them all stopped playing, it's no loss for the game or the devs.
---
Good thing asset safety (probably the silliest thing the Eve devs ever thought of) are on the way out. So your structure gets blown up but you get to keep everything that was inside it? Yeah, that makes sense.
---
im sorry it isnt your preferred pvp method
---
Since when has a game launch had an effect on the most AFKable game in the human history?
---
GOTTA FUCKING SHOOT THE FUCK OUT OF EVERYONE IN THIS GAME, MAINLY RENTERS AND FUCKING FURRIES, OH BOY, THOSE GOTTA GET SHOT HARD.
---
anything wrong with it?
---
Know what else will end?  People playing this game.  It's already well underway.

Financial genius here, this one. Watch out guys. We've got the next Warren Buffet here. Stand back.

Well done.  I never saw 01 and 02 in local, and had to wait a bit before 13 and 14 appeared before I took the screenshot - close to complete!

Isn't dscan hard-limited in some way? Like it's not just an arbitrary 14.3AU, there's a programming limitation behind that number.

Plex is already paid for. People using plex don't increase CCP's revenue. Arguably people driving up the isk cost of Plex by increasing demand with multiple accounts actually reduces CCPs bottomline since it means people buying plex with RL money need to buy fewer of them to maintain their PvP habit.
---
Think you might need to engage your brain before typing next time.

We had a fun skirmish with you guys last week!  Assuming I'm not getting flairbaited at least haha:   [https://br.inyour.space/?s=1001013&amp;b=8768040&amp;e=1470&amp;t=e](https://br.inyour.space/?s=1001013&amp;b=8768040&amp;e=1470&amp;t=e)
---
When its not that AFKable anymore?
---
Don't have the luxury of footage on my end, got webbed by a loki and shot and still tanked..only died later because our fleet was wiped and already spamming warp out..no shit, with no logi still doing anything.
---
Again, it's just going to prove how terrible the damage application is. Max skill using faction missiles, before webs/tp you're only applying 93 dps on a 10mn kiki (with pulsar's sig boost). That's shit. With a tp it's up to 113, and the one web you had from a loki can turn that up to 200~
---
And that's without considering our shield/skirmish links. The DNI's apply garbage damage.
---
I don't shoot krabs, I shoot other pvpers. Shooting krabs is so fucking boring
---
One Goonbot less a day. Not too long and we will have an actual human playerbase! \\o/

I KNOW RIGHT!? SO MANY RECONS TO BUILD AND SELL!

Maximum 32bit integer
---
How about we completely destroy the game and give them the ability to warp to d-scanned ships?
---
It takes a little bit of organization, but it's pretty easy to kill a drive-by super.vusually the hardest part is tackling it.
---
Range bonused scramblers can pick off command dessies two or three at a time when you close range. or spearfish part of the hostile fleet with your own booshes if you've got a flair for the dramatic.
---
Or bring munnins and alpha the command destoyers... But also don't sit in a tight perfectly bombable ball.
---
I'd settle for deleting downvoting options
---
the only ship i would like to see nullified is shuttles i'd also give them faster warp times and align times 
---
to the people stating about gate camps remember before nullified ships we had gate camps and people still got pass then nullified  ships just removed a skill (not a learning skill) from the game
---
How about 5k bots and 5k real players?
---
Apparently not chaotic since wormholes have about half to a third null's created to destroyed ratio.
---
Bots in null? Not nearly as much. It worked.
---
Privated it for a few hours around the start and people lost their damn minds.
---
drugs. lots of drugs. and quafe.
---
Prove that isk and mineral inflation caused by people playing the game effectively afk (with alliance intel services within earshot) is bad?
---
Why did you start off bashing Signal Cartel?  I stopped reading right there.
---
That is numberwang!
---
I know this blackout saltpost is not the right thread to post this in, but I'm going to anyway. 
---
Has anyone else switched from more multi boxed isk making activities to more single boxed activities? I am still an active player, but I log my alts in less often that I used to for mining or multi boxed ratting. I'm using relic/data exploration for a large portion of my income, rather than ratting or mining. I've seen on here that abysal and DED sites are also considered good isk under the blackout, and I would consider these to be single boxed activities primarily. So I'm down to 1/3 the accounts logged in for most of my playtime yet I'm still playing for pings, industry, moon mining, PI, and very occasionally subcap ratting. 
---
The blackout undeniably did have an effect on player counts, did cause a decent portion of players to quit, and did lead to reduced absolute numbers of easy targets in space (though they were made easier to catch). But how much if the player count reduction is due to quitting playerbase and how much is due to players adapting?
---
This is not accurate. CVA expects all provibloc pilots to respect the kos list and rules of engagement as outlined here:
---
https://www.cva-eve.org/guide-faq/
---
The Deliverance Area is wider than just the Providence region and I am confident that if any Provibloc pilot were shooting ppl not on the kos list anywhere in kspace they would get talked to at a minimum.
---
WHs are a bit of a special case, I think (personal belief) it is ok to shoot neuts in wspace if its in your hole or an adjacent hole but never was a wher myself so you should ask a diplo to be sure. They don't do much with whs beyond the individual pilot level and afaik this hasnt ever been a big enough deal to require real rules.
---
Source, former CVA/-7-
---
I don't know about the programming aspect at all. I only know about playing the game.
---
I appreciate all the call outs of what's going on.  There is a lot of work being done not just by Tuzzy but others in the game wanting to monitor the "Chaos" situation.  My own belief is that CCP will not change their direction on any one item unless there is an effect on revenue.  DAU and MAU numbers are nice indicators but nothing will actually move a company like lost Omega accounts or, players who leave the game and no longer credit card PLEX and/or Injectors.  That shoe still needs to drop.
---
Low-sec faction warfare areas are pretty much the only places where you can get consistent solo pvp right now.
---
what's the point of your posts?
---
People paying for their account via plex actually increase CCP revenue as a no th of game time costs more in real money than a subscription cost. In a perfect world for ccp all accounts would be paid monthly via plex.
---
&gt;More speedwarp is more fight. You want more fight right?
---
Not if all those fights are just the same boring nothingness. The thing that made EVE great was that the fighting meant something. Losing a ship would hurt, and killing one would feel amazing. Neither of those things are true anymore. Even super capital kills barely register those emotions at this point.
---
EVE has been straying further and further away from *quality* in it's crusade for increased *quantity.* Which is unfortunate, because the *quality* was the thing that made EVE PVP special.
---
The entire point of the skilling spree was to generate login numbers to push their blackout agenda, they couldn't give two shits about F2P players.  CCP in general seems to be regretting F2P in general since it doesn't seem to be having the retention effects they hoped for, judging by average login numbers.
---
Uninstall and reinstall eve?
---
The judge was/is a player that, for whatever reason, betrayed the alliance Circle of Two using his high-level access rights to steal a bunch of stuff ( I believe including a keepstar citadel, which was their central base correct me if I'm wrong ) and handed it over to another group, I think he joined them after. GigX then said something to the effect of "I'll cut off your hands" and he got banned for threatening violence or something.
---
Hi Friend,
---
Posting your own Eve video's is allowed but their are some guidelines to do so.
---
1: Blatant advertising for your channel will get removed (such as this thread)  
---
2: Clickbait titles (TOP PVE CONTENT) also get removed  
---
Effectively if you're sharing things you've done in Eve in an organic nature we have no problems with that. Attempts to game the subreddit for views on the other hand will get shut down.
---
&gt; Arguably people driving up the isk cost of Plex by increasing demand with multiple accounts actually reduces CCPs bottomline since it means people buying plex with RL money need to buy fewer of them to maintain their PvP habit.
---
It's also reasonable to argue that higher demand for Plex means more people will buy Plex to sell ingame, since they get more isk for their dollar.
---
64 bit client now
---
No FC with a brain is going to risk that, with the way EVE mechanics work.  The fight just won't happen, its not worth a 50/50 of getting your cap fleet bubblefucked off of the objective grid.
---
People buying plex for RL money will still buy plex for RL money. This will not change.
---
BUT if the isk/plex ratio drops (due to lower demand), those people will actually need to buy MORE of them with RL money to replace their losses in game. This results in HIGHER income for CCP.
---
lets just remove any sort of bubbles and extend point/scram ranges by 10km each.
---
Can't the same be said of anything pvp? Ifyou have 50+ people to call upon that happen to be in the area and can fit for whatever is needed, anything that's alone can be killed "pretty easily".
---
It's still taking massive effort to kill them compared to what they were doing in the first place though; getting 50 people together,  holding tackle, getting people in the right ships VS a guy that jumps in a single ship and attacks a ship that can't fight for an instant 9b+ kill
---
Those that don't go to war deserve to die to the baby seal clubbers.
---
YOU HAVE A POINT, I HAVE BEEN BAITED ON A FREE THREAD

---
Use the fact that this thread hasn't been downvoted into oblivion by the blackout defenders.
---
be faster than your opponent, attack them whilst they are 'confused and bewildered' by the chaos era, kill those who do not adapt.
---
you have a weak mind with this weak view your just shared the world. goons are weak without thier current meta game. end is coming for goons, RIP
---
Torps, bomb launcher, cloak for null, replace bomb launcher with probe for WH space or bring refit, depending on how you hunt. Arbalest launchers are overall better but I tend to fit T2 as preference. 
---
Damps, target painter, prop mod and disruptor in mids, adjust as needed (Depending on amount of mid slots).  
---
Personally I prefer AB for WH space, MWD for null always (To escape gate camps).
---
For lows, DCU and BCS. Fitting mods (PCU, PG modules) as/if needed.
---
Hyperspatials or application (Explosion radius, missile velocity) in rigs.

BECAUSE I RUINED IT
---
It was my understanding that the slightest rupture of the pod would, by default, kill the pilot so that they could be transferred to the clone.
---
I am intrigued to learn what condition would not compel the rupture of the pod to kill the pilot.
---
Don’t panic - the cyno changes will fix all of this and bring all the players back.
---
Eve is more than a client my dude
---
hihi?
---
no dont fix the things for new players. let them join like everyone thats leaving did, like veryone thats playing did.
---
let the strong stay, the weak leave.
---
let eve be chaotic. i think people still teach 'learn to loose a ship' but they do not listen to thier own advice.
---
See my response to Kristalnacht for a real answer
---
Oh no online numbers are fluctuating for a online game!
---
Like a fedo
---
Making isk should be hard. I've been ratting and d-scan or intel channels have warned me every time. Making massive isk should not be afk-able. Or a situation where you just watch local and dock up. There's zero risk in that. 
---
Traveling in a fleet makes use of scouts and adds a layer of probing. I see nothing wrong with that. Doesn't take long to get a clear idea of a system. This works both ways as well, so it hurts and benefits everyone. 
---
Hunting is still pretty doable.  You should be able to scan someone down before you even decloak if their on d-scan and at a belt or anom. Hunters used to be seen 10 jumps away and the entire region would dock up or be on warning. That's not really fair either is it? 
---
You're basically telling me Eve has become too risky and challenging for players. I find that a pitiful excuse to leave the game. The current game is way more fair and balanced. It's not perfect, but it's a huge step to a better Eve. 
---
There's a lot of factors players are not logging in, I wouldn't be so fast to pin it all on the blackout. I personally know players that have come back because of the blackout.
---
If at all, it only shows how risk-averse and whiny sov 0.0 has become.
---
People who are leaving because of blackout literally contributed nothing towards the game itself other than increasing inflation and the occasional KM.
---
THAT FIRST LINE ACTUALLY MADE ME LOL IRL I REALLY WANT TO TELL YOU HOW I APPRECIATE YOUR HUMOUR BUT IT'S NOT FRIDAY SO FUCK YOU
---
I thought chaos changes were controversial though
---
We were doing 250-800 per volley per DNI, yes they don't apply great but they still will never need more that 3 volleys to pop anything you brought.
---
We didn't have the option to reship, and most of us did not fight the SF Kiki fleet before this fight and didn't even know about them being involved so yea.
---
You've convinced me. Less players are better for CCP.
---
Less *accounts*
---
Jesus. My point went STRAIGHT over your head obviously.
---
Thats what I used to tell people.... but the amount of blobbing currently going on in the Faction Warfare Zones is incredible. I see a rise of Nullblocs popping into LS and just blobbing the shit out of it, but completely unrelated to that I have been having a very hard time actually finding 1v1s, or even fair fights in general. While the chance in novices is smaller, it still happens way too often that even my t1 frigs are getting blobbed on ( the typical baitpunisher coming in with more people popping up on 1 au before he even slid properly)
---
Unsuprisingly CCP are completely out of touch and have no clue when it comes to the cyno changes. Any offensive usage of caps is heavily penalized due to unreasonable costs for suicide cynos, recons are tiny so your caps will always bump hardcore (hf using marshals as suicide cynos for dreads/supers lol) and the amount of accounts needed (that require 1 input, blops bridger, hard recon cyno, etc) is just silly. Oh and super hunting is nerfed hardcore with no HIC cynos.
---
This would probably be fine I guess if it weren't for the fact that rorquals can still cyno reasonably safely under an umbrella with no extra characters using industry cynos (you can store a nereus in your SMA for your mercox miner to reship into) then having theta or whatever your umbrellas equivelent bridging a bricked Falcon cyno (+ fax) to it, which can recieve rorq RR and tank all but 100 man stuka fleets.
---
Roamed to Fountain. 
---
Joking aside, times are tough nowadays and there aren't many players who are interested in small scale or spontaneous PVP left in Nullsec. The best way to generate fights in a frigate is to threaten their miners/ratters by showing up in their anomalies and hanging around, and hoping they undock another frigate to get rid of you. Unfortunately this has become much harder to do as you have observed since the capital umbrella with Rorquals/Supers have replaced typical barge miners and PVE battleships of the past, so you are much less threatening to their activity so there is far less reasons for them to want to actually engage you to remove you from their space. 
---
With the hecate chasing you a good idea is to orbit him at 30km or something with your MWD on, assuming he is blaster fit, since he won't be able to catch you hopefully he'll decide to swap into a faster ship that can catch you (which you have a better chance of fighting). 
---
Otherwise it's pretty hit or miss. I've found roaming to the Chinese areas of the game fairly refreshing since they are much more aggressive and spontaneous with their home defence, rather than just relying on the capital umbrella as a purely reactive response.
---
Nice troll
---
PoE League?
---
Yeah definitely can be argued either way. I'd think CCP would have their own data on that which us reddit plebs might never see.
---
That game has zero similarities to a fighter sim
---
You're not in the pod the entire time. We had a captains quarters at one point where you could walk around the hangar and go in to your own personal room. It didn't get used that much so they took it out.
---
I really think you need to stop using the term "player count" and start using the term "character count", as that's the data you are presenting. In a game which significant amount of multiboxing is encouraged (and even required in some cases) this is not an insignificant distinction.
---
IDK what part you disagree with, the cyno being still a danger as it always was or stating the second part of your post is written to paint yourself as a victim despite not being one.
---
I guess you just want to ree about a change killing your playstyle, even if nothing's really changing and your gameplay is already very low hanging fruit?

Lol look at the MER for [Aug](https://webimg.ccpgamescdn.com/7lhcm73ukv5p/1udXYFVj8ENjna8mfM0neJ/d50ad6cb1bc72dcbf30abaee6e9a39cd/3_npc.bounties.by.region.png) and [Jul](https://webimg.ccpgamescdn.com/7lhcm73ukv5p/7veFdK7e6IvT54YT4zBvwB/43496376eb6b3b360ac3270b5b638fb9/3_npc.bounties.by.region.png)
---
Delve dropped the least out of all the nullsec regions, from 4.7 to 4.3, whereas everywhere else except Esoteria, Cache,and Malpais dropped like a brick. It's clear that Umbrella regions maintained their output while non-umbrella regions became emptied. Bots don't benefit form umbrellas, since bots can't get on comms and communicate their situation. At the same time, [Delve is also the "peacetime" null regions with the most destroyed](https://webimg.ccpgamescdn.com/7lhcm73ukv5p/LKy39MJffyftpdICWEBuu/3f121be2b17b0b2b53ac38d9e8638583/2_destruction.value.by.region_bar.png), with Deteroid being first due to war, and providence third due to being farmed hard. So it comes to reason that bots don't have a very good time in Delve due to high frequency of gankers which is only deterred by the umbrella that bots can't utilize.
---
Where you can see that bots fucked off is regions where the numbers dropped hardest between [June](https://webimg.ccpgamescdn.com/7lhcm73ukv5p/1PO8JYktMcsZUCJxgz4F4t/ae88384dbd356092092dc9da8fdea327/3_npc.bounties.by.region.png) and August.
---
Branch from 4.7T to 0.259
---
Deklein from 2.7T to 0.270
---
Fethaybolis from 1.55 to .176
---
Perrigen Falls from 1.7 to .16
---
Tenal fro 2.8 to .215
---
TL:DR, facts don't care about your feelings.
---
Risk is exponentially higher, resources spawn on a much smaller scale per "liveable area " (only one hole), no defense from surrounding system / a cap umberella or any of the likes.
---
Another blackout post. Our Corp has been fairly inactive the last few weeks as a lot of people are on holiday. And others are bingeing wow.
---
But that doesn’t suit your narrative. Carry on
---
Fewer*
---
You've convinced me. Fewer *accounts* are better for CCP.
---
So if you're lucky you pick up a &lt;100m kill or two? They're disengaging so they aren't staying to get one shot, or to let scrams get on top of them.
---
In terms of login numbers and the point of the post there is no effective difference between the two. It's really not a flawed assumption. The only representative data we have for player activity is the login numbers. The important part here is the difference between the two (or multiple) time periods used. There's no reason to assume multiboxers somehow did not log in prior, or did log in previous time periods. If you want to treat this like an academic study then:
---
1: We can say average logins are way down  
---
2: We can most likely infer from this that player counts are down  
---
In reality we can just skip the academic bit and say first hand player counts are down with a high degree of confidence.
---
Wow, imagine hating people who play the same game you do, for no other reason than that they don't engage in the same mindset you do. This game thrives on any playstyle, hoping for people to leave the game because they play differently than you is ultimately just hoping to be playing in a sandbox by yourself.
---
It's Monday morning, give us time ;-)

HOLY FUCK THIS GAME IS SHIT AS OF LATE AND I SERIOUSLY HOPE HILMAR WAKES THE FUCK UP HES RUINING THE GAME WE LOVE TO RUIN FOR EACHOTHER
---
AND  DON'T GET ME STARTED ON THE RETARDED SHITADELS THEY CAN'T FIGURE OUT TO BALANCE!
---
&gt;BUT if the isk/plex ratio drops (due to lower demand), those people will actually need to buy MORE of them with RL money to replace their losses in game. This results in HIGHER income for CCP.
---
Unless people stop buying plex because it has gone too low and they feel buying more plex for thw same isk isntworth it
---
64 bit numbers were frequently used before 64 bit applications existed. 
---
Unless, that is, it was impossible to have more than 2.1 billion ISK until the 64 bit client.
---
as someone who has enjoyed hunting streamers in the past.
---
if you try and hide it, we will find you. if you hide we, we will actively take that as a challenge, and we will win.
---
we can find you from your character name alone, your fleet name, your overview, when you warp to a belt. the background of the space your in, and simply just looking at your local window. or cosmic anomaly codes.
---
my advice. show people where you are, be open about being new. fly cheap. and take it on the chin when you die. you will die. response and salt is what theyll want. your choice.
---
Freighters in general are some of the most broken ship designs in the game, which create non-engaging, boring PvP.
---
Aside form warp to zero, regular freighters get no real benefit from the player actively piloting them and if someone wants to gank them there's nothing they can really do, so they might as well AFK them, scale up with an army of alts and take the occasional loss. It's just like a bunch of zebras that move around lions, "sure, they'll get that one slow/young/old/sick animal and eat it, but the rest of us will be safe". Exceptions to this are the professional contract haulers with webber alts that move between the main hubs, but people moving their own stuff in some out of the way place just set autopilot on their 5 freighters and go have a coffee or something (i have multiple screenshots of freighter herds)
---
JFs are slightly more engaging due to their jump drive capability, but suffer from a lot of the same issues while also being a much shinier killmail, while at the same time completely breaking the concept of supply lines. This affects all large scale pvp on the long-term/strategic level and makes a lot of engaging and interesting tactics from the real world impossible to replicate in game, so we get a sci-fi space game that plays more like a medieval siege and not like a space blitzkrieg/combined arms experience. Jump your JFs around to move the necessary supplies, plop down some citadels (aka towers and castles), jump in some capitals (aka siege machines) and have at it. It would be so much more interesting if we had actual reasons to get into smaller ships and see more varied fleet compositions with battleships 2-3 times the amount of capitals for escort and mainline DPS, and smaller subcaps to escort the battleships and screen the fleet (spread out across multiple systems instead of on a single, 1% TiDi grid), or cruisers and below roaming around to choke enemy supply lines, much like light cavalry (in the old days) and fast armor (in the present) works in the real world.
---
But you can't really blame the freighter pilots and the alliances using them this way for logistics when you can't even properly fit them, they are so slow to move around and die the moment someone sneezes in their general direction.
---
If it was up to me, i'd change all cynos (yes, those for combat ships too) to have a spool up and a "sphere or uncertainty" in which you will land, depending on skills and maybe mass that goes through so it doesn't always land you on the exact spot the cyno is, then make freighters and JFs real ships to keep it balanced. You know, with medium and high slots and enough PG/CPU to fit something useful (like some tank and cloak/mwd), and a buff to align time and warp speed (this would probably necessitate buffing t2 haulers as well to keep them viable by being faster than freighters). Then there's more incentive to actually be on the wheel when flying one.
---
Instead of flying a completely vulnerable loot pinata and trying to compensate for their drawbacks with mechanics like dead-accurate jumping on the game side or an army of alts on the player side (webbers, cynos, etc), it would be a case where everyone (hunter and hunted) would actually have to play the game and put in some hands-on work to get a kill or survive.
---
I really don't know how people actually fly them in their current state and i don't get why people get excited to kill them either (ok, apart from the loot), it seems more boring than running missions. I've trained into DSTs and BRs for personal logistics/trading and the occasional contract haul, but freighters are so not worth it unless you are doing something that specifically requires massive cargo space.
---
This guy's asking the important questions
---
There's no way to know for sure based on the data CCP makes available. Though, a lot can be inferred from market activity and the MER. All that can be said for sure is it's a pretty deep negative trend. We know less players (people) are in with high confidence, but the ratio of loss to multiboxers / non multiboxers is unknown. You can make some educated assumptions though.
---
Path of Exile, I think they are just like a new season/patch

could you make it so it saves the last values we put in the margin calc?

As usual, this change makes it easier to defend on the sov scale than attack. It's easier to pop random ratting carriers/rorquals with blops and kikis, but much harder to actually commit caps on the offense, which is what enables you to "kill" opponents. The defender still has ansiblexes to reinforce subcaps directly into system. The attacker has to use titan bridges onto fragile recons/blobs. The defender can reinforce caps via the cynobeacon, the attacker again has to use easily blappable recons/blops. The defender can set up caps on the cynojammer/cynobeacon and establish easy grid control since LR HAW dreads/LR titans can pop cyno ships with ease and prevent enemy caps from even getting in the system.
---
When you make strategic defense easier, like with timezone tanking and citadels, you discourage strategic war. Not a hard concept to understand.
---
So we can get them nurfed into the ground too?
---
Is it me or are the bulk of anti-blackout posts and supporters by Goons or their blue-buddies?

Something tells me they're feeling a lot more pain than the rest of us.

MAYBE IF HALF THIS SUB STOPPED LOOKING AT ONLINE NUMBERS/MONTHLY DATA YOU WOULD HAVE MORE FUN PLAYING THE FUCKING GAME.

You need to do some reading my dude. That makes exactly 0 difference

Wow holy shit, what a massive blob of text for a random low class krab fortizar. Maximum effort but noone reading this has ever heard of most of the involved corps
---
Blackout is what we sometimes joke in the army about being a comanded success, the order that it is a success is made and the people in positions of power decided that it works, so no need to discuss it, the command have been made, and it wont be changed bwcause that would mean they would have to admit to have made mistake...
---
LETS PLAY GALAXY ON ROBLOX INSTEAD OF THIS SHIT
---
According to Reddit, yes.
---
And nothing of any value was lost.
---
The trend started before the launch of WoW Classic. However, people would be fools to think that a game whose players are primarily older and in the prime demographic cWoW, wouldn't have an impact on Eve. 
---
It's literally the most popular MMO of all time relauching its glory day period designed to pull in Eve's exact demographic (25-35 somethings who enjoy old style MMO's).
---
still over 500 people on test server showing interest (not bad number on there)
---
13k late US TZ on a sunday? damn nice numbers. 
---
let all the quitters quit, let all the botters and rorq alts unsub, let the battles commence
---
Whales gonna whale.
---
From my admittedly anecdotal experience, it's easier to make a whale pay more, than to make a non-whale into a whale.
---
Nothing of value was lost.

If anyone's going to do it.. It's going to be you Tuz.

Oh wow lol.

Again, it's PCU, not logins.

People may well still be logging in...just not sitting there for 10 hours in relative safety so instead playing for an hour or two with their attention on the screen.

The thing is they aren't marketing it to eve players. It's to go along side for fps players.
---
It's like the changes and plans they are putting in place has everyone screaming "but your veterans don't want this and they will leave.
---
The changes aren't to satisfy the vets especy with low player count.
---
The changes are to bring in new players and make them stay for the future of the game.
---
14 AU is 2,147,483,647km, which is (2^32)/2-1, the larges possible 32bit signed integer.
---
Soo. Wasting time endlessly warping is quality I guess?
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; This would probably be fine I guess if it weren't for the fact that rorquals can still cyno reasonably safely under an umbrella with no extra characters using industry cynos (you can store a nereus in your SMA for your mercox miner to reship into) then having theta or whatever your umbrellas equivelent bridging a bricked Falcon cyno (+ fax) to it, which can recieve rorq RR and tank all but 100 man stuka fleets.
---
I don't believe that they've said you can bridge to an industrial cyno, so your plan of bridging a Falcon to it will fail hilariously.
---
Give interceptors and interdictors the ability to free-warp, and target and intercept others who are in warp using special modules exclusive to them. Kinda like how the FSD interdiction works in Elite: Dangerous 
---
It might break the game. It might also contribute to the Chaos Era in a way that is unprecedented in EVE. You thought you were safe while warping? Not anymore :D
---
If more accounts means a less fun experience for other players, then indeed this is the case.
---
Less, fewer, who cares except GoT nerds and English teachers.
---
But if less accounts are being paid for with plex then people are purchasing less plex with money and ccp is making less money.
---
FUCK OFF YOU ELITIST PRICK. JUST BECAUSE PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD BOTH INJECTORS AND A CAPS LOCK KEY DOESN'T MEAN YOU GET TO SHAME THEM.
---
Very easy when you have a director who can ne convinced to give out corp shares to someone. Then that someone initiates vote for new ceo and he is the only one with major shares.....
---
Says who?
---
There's a whole plex store for people to spend things on now.
---
I found I learned way more flying t1 cheap fit cruisers.
---
You get to actuually exist in the fight. If you make a mistake you have time to either correct it or Atleast see why you are dying and not just be removed from the field.
---
I encourage all to get into cruisers ASAP.
---
Is SLYCE an actual coalition member, a pet, or do they just hold sov in the area and are blue with the Pandemic alliances?
---
It only teaches you "you made a mistake, you die"
---
Frigates die so fast as a newbro you simply don't learn anything other then what ships will delete you.
---
What possible reason would it need to be signed
---
"After the removal of nullification from combat ceptors they've seen a pretty steep decline in usage."
---
Wrong.
---
They added Assault Damage Control and any other small ship is now basically unused. Try again.
---
I didn't know CCP pays their bills in fun.
---
No, the people buying plex with RL money aren't the ones using it for subs.
---
People buying plex with RL money, will still buy plex.
---
What happens to the plex AFTER that is what would change: if plex ended up at 0.01 isk - then everyone would end up spending it on skins f.e.
---
Blops can jump to industrial cynos, which means they can bridge to it. The process goes Rorq panic &gt; notify the umbrella, they get undocked in FAX/Supers/HAW dreads &gt; industrial lights an industrial cyno while under PANIC invuln &gt; Blops Bridges a number of suicide brick tanks recons. They wait under jump immunity and light coordinated cynos &gt; umbrella jumps in.
---
Thanks
---
Why not just delete them? They lost their purpose. Sometimes less is better. Why spend time and resources in something that's not really useful or missed by most?
---
Some sort of "follow warp signature" module that lets an inteceptor blindly warp to where their last target warped off to.  No mid warp interception, but an inteceptor would, with it's higher warp speed land on grid before the target.
---
I think if CCP is unsuccesful in providing fun to it's playerbase it'd have a very real, meaningful effect on their actual player counts (rather than account PCU).
---
[We didn't listen!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqUUlBwtKNs)
---
Yeah, I can see a lot of crossover between Eve Online and PoE players just because the skill system is set up in PoE to allow for tons of min/maxing and builds aren't nearly as clearly defined as other ARPGs... So it wouldn't surprise me in the least to find out that this weekend was down for Eve and maybe the next 2-3 as well.
---
Isn't your whole point that less accounts means less people paying via plex, and are asserting this is a good thing?
---
Yeah thats what I was getting at. Like its no secret play count is dropping a bit but the giant drop is surely because of WoW Classic. Hell, a decent amount of my corp has been playing WoW rather than EvE.
---
Int is signed by default in Python, Python doesn't have built in unsigned int.
---
Uh and what similarities with a fps? When it's third person? And commanding a space ship.. that's not very first person or shooterish. So I say again it's closer to a fighter sim as in planes n shit than an FPS.
---
It's closer to Hawks than it is cod.
---
Came here for combat ceptor buff, don't think that this is a solution.
---
Vily and Elo = Accurate
---
No absolutely not, pretty much the opposite.
---
My point is that fewer people SUBBING with plex doesn't affect their bottom-line at all. The number BUYING it is very likely to remain constant.
---
In addition, people running multiboxed, afk-style accounts with these subs only causes isk and mineral inflation in-game whilst not actually providing much in the way of content for the 'real' players.
---
Interesting idea, but this will kill the deep safes.        
---
Do we truly want to do it?           
---
Even if the idea is good i don't know if interceptor class should get this kind of role.
---
FUCKING NOOB ALERT, NO ONE HAS FUN \~PLAYING\~ EVE.

[2,147,483,647](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2,147,483,647)
---
Fewer people subbing with plex does affect their bottom line. As I explained ccp would prefer more accounts using plex not less as it costs the player base more money to subscribe via plex.
---
I am not going to debate what these players are doing because that is beyond the conversation.
---
I do agree with you. There needs to be a balance and there needs to be measured change taking place to restore said balance. What is happening right now feels a lot to me like throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks. Maybe that's good for a quick shake up but that's not what we need, we need the balance to be restored.
---
Do you post these things just to make yourself feel better and assure yourself that this cHaOs ErA was a good thing for the game, or do you actually believe this? lmao
---
I HAVE UNSUBBED ALL MY ACCOUNT BUT I SWEAR IT'S NOT BECAUSE OF CYNO CHANGES BUT JUST BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE TIME TO PLAY ANYMORE I BLAME MY GF FRIENDS AND SPORT
---
its*    
---
I'm amazed by the mental gymnastics you do, to convince yourself that dropping player counts are good. Especially in a game that has a rather small playerbase and that is (once again) losing people that have been very loyal to this niche game.
---
People are doing an awesome job to overcome the obstacles the EVE UI throws at them and sometimes even CCP has no better tools available (see "♦ ships are fitted with Pyfa"), but all the HR and overlord applications are influencing the game too much IMO.
---
And what if the people buying plex don't see the value of buying plex anymore? You think they will buy plex no matter the isk value but plenty of people have a line of where they will buy plex instead of grinding it in game and if that goes low enough they just stop buying plex.
---
It doesn't no really most player styles are nerved to a degree of not being remotely fun, the blackout fixes that for non bearing play styles to some degree, now my personal take on the numbers drop is that most people that engaged in non-bearing play styles already quit, before this change got pushed in. 
---
Now those players have a limited return rate because spoiler most folks don't quick pissy they quit because the game is boring and stop following it.
---
Given all the bearing play style players have been posting adapt or die for years, so the response while being non-productive is understandable.
---
That's true, but it also means our "player count" is probably significantly lower 2006 with the same PCU, since players multibox far more now than in 2006, so the same 25,000 characters is being played than less people.
---
I post it because it's hilarious seeing the goon salt and spin.
---
PushX has a cyno alt corp which some use, though it's only showing 7 in corp now.
---
https://evewho.com/corporation/98323770
---
I don't think nullsec is any easier than it was before. And the blackout intel changes were primarily about the fact that a large number of people could make up a soft unskilled production line and be shored up by a lot of effort of a few to guard that production. By creating difficult to penetrate checkpoints you bring that back into action.
---
"Eve is dying due to bots! Fix it!" *CCP starts banning bots actively and makes the game harder for bots to be successful* "eve is dying people aren't logging in!"
---
But how much is asset safety for the Palatine if the keepstar you keep it in is destroyed.
---
The salt shakers are running wild. Sadly most miss the hard issue. We don't want people to leave. It is not a good thing on so many grounds. 
---
EVE is a game I love because it is not easy and I don't get bored. It has kept me amused for 10+ years and I am still drawn to it because it is hard and requires spreadsheets and probably a Phd. It takes a lot for a new user to get stuck in and even more to get them to stay. Over the past few months I have seen a lot leave. Not bots or virtual players but actual ones. For every one that leaves it is a small stab in EVE's heart. 
---
As one who works with servers I understand the concept of critical mass. The amount of souls that is required to make other people feel that this is something to get into. 26,000 is the busiest our universe has been in the past week. but look at the graphs and that is only a spike in the EU evening. 2am EU time and it is down to 15k and at 6am it is down to 12k.   
---
Concerning is that the US player base has diminished dramatically and I ask if your logging on and see there are only 10K players how are you going to feel? Many say that less is better. I feel that is not the case as it does not instil confidence that there is growth. It concerns me on how CCP will make real money to pay for servers and staff. It concerns me that ingame markets and goods are in turmoil as there is an oversupply due to fewer buyers.   
---
Not all play EVE for PVP. Many are  industrialists, building, selling and other non Mining/Ratting/PVP things. This downturn effects them and they look elsewhere to occupy their freetime.   
---
But still the salt is tossed with glee, begging players to quit and leave. "All is good."  
---
Remember it takes a long time to get a new player addicted and right now players are leaving faster than new ones are even signing up. We need to desperately retain our existing players and try our best to get the old ones to return. 
---
At what point do you feel that there are too few people online to bother any more? 
---
10K  
---
8K  
---
5K
---
What point is there a lack of critical mass and all that are left are the dedicated few which don't pay in enough to keep the lights on? 
---
The lowest amount online a year ago was 29,397 which exceeds the busiest point the past 2 weeks 28,899. The lowest number for the past two weeks 12,086 less than half of what it was a year ago.
---
The plex can get used in other fashions because of the plex store.
---
Also, how many alpha's would sub with plex if the cost was lower?
---
The plex isn't going to get wasted.
---
Hmmm...
---
1. Part of the drop is indeed active players who don't like the changes, i'll give you that.
---
2. Another part of the drop is the banned bot accounts that number in the thousands each month, plus those readjusting to other, safer, less profitable activities and trying to setup their operation from scratch, resulting in reduced concurrent bot logins in the meantime (they have to move to hisec, sell their null ratting ships, buy hisec mining ships, roll new alts, etc). Tbh i'd rather have botting ventures and haulers mining and running courrier missions in hisec, than botting supers in null.
---
3. Yet another is the people who went to play WoW classic.
---
4. Some are students and kids starting school, grown-ups dealing with their kids doing that, or simply adults busy setting up and making plans for their new "business season" after the summer holidays. There's always a dip in September due to RL reasons, the current one is just bigger because of the aforementioned groups adding their weight into it.
---
5. And finally, part of it is people like me who play casually and mostly solo, plexing one or two months at a time because there's not really a lot of interesting stuff happening and there hasn't been for years, long before the blackout was even a possibility. Killing content and reasons to fight is as much the players' fault as it is CCP's fault. 'Member the whole OTEC garbage? I 'member...you can't forget really, because we have the perimeter keepstar to remind us all of this mentality.
---
I'm sure there are more, these are just the ones i could come up in 5 seconds flat without even thinking about it.
---
So, to conclude:
---
1. The PCU numbers show us how many characters (not people) are online.
---
2. The PCU tells us nothing about the contribution of each aforementioned demographic/group (and the myriad other groups not logging in) in the numbers of those not logging in. We don't know what % is bots, what % is people busy with RL, or what % is players legitimately throwing in the towel, etc.
---
3. People who are trying to pin everything on the first group ( aka real players quitting due to some balancing changes) are just as inaccurate and lacking concrete data as the people who are defending the changes no matter what. It smells of ulterior motives and frankly, it reads a lot like "my playstyle got nerfed, look at all those people leaving, please bring it back or i'll pout and shout". It's laughable because it's so obvious.
---
'Bro it's just the bots leaving bro!'
---
'Haha didn't want those KRABS anyways!'
---
'It's just WoW Classic's release causing this!!!'
---
'I've seen more activity now than ever!!! Recruitment is up!!!'
---
'Stukka meta is fun and engaging!!'
---
Lmao blackout, amiright?
---
Here's an hypothesis for you: what if it's the amount of multiboxing which was required to be successful that was driving people away from the game? And that by reducing the barriers to success will lead to a higher player count in the long run?
---
Recons don't even need to be suicide unless you're tackled by a super large fleet. [Look](https://imgur.com/cgoOb1D) what a single 3 rep rorqual can do to a falcon, nevermind the FAX + extras that will land 10s or so later.
---
Now i know about the exploit where if you perform ME/TE research on a locked BPO it will be dropped into your hangar but what exploit lets you do such a thing with fully researched PBOs?
---
if 7000 bot bans cause a 4000 PCU drop then we are already FUBAR.
---
Well that's maybe 10 people gameplay getting ruined so not that big of a deal ...
---
Well you can still undock dreadnoughts and kill em.  Or bump. Or gank in destination.      
---
Its just not "solo pilot can do everything" anymore. Oh wonder, you now need friends and group gameplay in an mmo....
---
What happens when 2 months later, people get bored of classic, and the numbers still don't come back up.
---
Did you see the post about the guy that spend 7b for "renting" a HK hole?
---
Look at the graphs this is not a past two week thing this is past 6 month thing. Ver obvious trend that is getting faster.
---
&gt;industrial lights an industrial cyno while under PANIC invuln
---
Why can anything light a cyno while under PANIC in the first place? Literally invulnerable cynos, that's pretty dumb bro.
---
You can bridge to an industry cyno.
---
But you can also post on reddit saying it won't be an issue without educating yourself on the topic.
---
Reasons.
---
Most people agree the majority of plex are used for subscriptions. Are you implying people use the majority of plex for things that aren't subscriptions?
---
Roflmao tactical bullshit reconfiguration that's good
---
So your plan to make eve online great again is remove highsec players?
---
Wormholes, like the rest of Eve, are about risk management.
---
Despite 'living'/being based in one, you can totally keep stuff in npc stations in Thera/K Space. 
---
It significantly limits how much you risk, and you have fine control over it.
---
With enough held back, it isn't much worse than a slightly expensive failed deployment.
---
Yesterday I saw a post where a guy settled an argument about electricity by applying alligator clips to his testicles, taking a picture of it and posting it, and then running current through the clips.  
---
If there isn't a sub of things clipped to testicles then there needs to be.
---
Yeah thats fine too, I was just replying to the bit about the large drop over the holiday weekend which was to be expected regardless I believe
---
Trigs need serious looking at.  Way over tuned.
---
But where am I supposed to get my daily "Eve is dying" threads from?
---
Your unbridled enthusiasm qualifies you as moderator. Congratulations! Go forth and spread the word about ball shock clips to the masses.
---
Man, should I believe numbers or your anecdote. I'm so torn.
---
Not gonna lie, not having access to zKill and r/eve was a weird time. Sometimes you are just bored and want to look up if your alliance managed to kill/lose something big or if anything new happened in New Eden.
---
Awwww. You're crying because the risk free game you've played takes some skill and effort now. A little challenge won't hurt ya. Brighten up buttercup.
---
IIRC the brain scan used to imprint the new clone was a "destructive read" that was directly what killed the occupant.

YOU SOUND ELITE AF.

ARE YOU MAD BECAUSE YOU HAVE NO CONTENT WITHIN 3 FUCKING REGIONS OF YOURSELVES?

HERE'S AN IDEA: RESET. YOUR. BLUES.

&gt;Try again.
---
How would Hilmar justify his wage if he cant pick the dumbest ideas r/eve comes up with and claim them as his own? 
---
He'd have to actually listen to actual feedback and thats effort we all know he doesntcwant to deal with.
---
[deleted]
---
&gt; what if it's the amount of multiboxing (or the perception of it) which is/was required to be successful that was driving people away from the game?
---
That's a completely valid point, but these changes CCP have been making don't reduce the number of alts needed, but rather increase it. Blackout and the cyno change puts a heavy emphasis on having a gatewatcher in a pod, a cyno alt in an industrial/recon, a fax alt on standby, etc.
---
Survivability in EVE comes from both evasion and resilience. Evasion allows smaller groups/ lower alt count, while resilience requires larger groups/more alts. CCP has been continuously nerfing PvE evasion in null (local removal, NSA warp scram, etc) because evasion is non-interactive with the hunters, so people look to resilience for Survivability (the EHP buffer of supers, PANIC, etc), and that requires more alts.
---
Very little, anything that can be done with one can be done with multiple accounts in eve by the “hardcore”
---
The issue is the “hardcore” players are leaving when their subs lapse, it just isn’t worth the grind and the punishment is too high for just... playing eve.  Unless you play it the “safe” way isk wise with frigates , which is fine
---
But it isn’t fun.  And as a business, having account subscriptions plummet as a business model is about as effective as a restaurant manager personally spitting in everyone’s food.  Sure some will have the kink to enjoy that, some will come drinking water watching other people get disgusted as they eat, snickering, some might even try to spit on the food themselves.
---
But eventually all you have left are people drinking water and a whole lot of spit-filled food.  
---
Less subscriptions to any game is a death sentence when competitors come and rise a dime a dozen.  Eves ONLY saving grace is, for now, it’s one of a kind.
---
Our player base have also aged significantly since 2006 so it is not good to compare to that time.
---
Don't forget about Brexit! and whatever other excuse you can think of. Games are being released all the time.
---
Have an alt do your BPO work that you can then contract to your main. You’re free from being stolen from.
---
I wonder if we'll get this update next week if the 'player count' increases.
---
when there is no one left playing it will be safe to drop, eh?
---
Good work dude, keep it coming! Maybe you could put the numbers in a graph each week in order to visualize it - visual models are most useful in persuading the more stubborn type.
---
Kind of like the one [made by Jestertrek](http://jestertrek.com/eve/players/eve-players-fouryear-compro.png) but then a shorter periode each year for the past 4 to 5 years in order to compare the same time periods in different years.
---
Are you counting boosts from the foreman linked rorqs?
---
&gt; Are ppl rly that retarded?
---
I saw a guy using a paladin to run hisec combat anoms.
---
For me its already too late, they lost my trust, ill invest my time to some better products &amp; keep troling r/Eve for some time ;D
---
**CORRELATION IS NOT CAUSATION**
---
Back the the day that would not have been so.....
---
Harbinger navy is a good example.
---
A well fit harbinger navy is a killing machine with 90k ehp buffer.
---
Meanwhile the harbinger is just crap.
---
The maximum value for a double integer(2\^32)-1 is 4,294,967,295
---
This converts from km to 28.71 Au. Divide that by 2(to get the radius) and you get 14.355 au
---
 The maximum value for a double integer(2\^32)-1 is 4,294,967,295
---
Agree. Attributing a drop in characters to just the blackout at this point is disingenuous.
---
Deep saves are almost bugs so yes killing them is fine. Deep saves vs make eve dangerouse.
---
I don't think it's signed.
---
So in practice the number is even higher if the Rorqal is fit with boosts like they should be.
---
&gt;That's a completely valid point, but these changes CCP have been making don't reduce the number of alts needed, but rather increase it. Blackout and the cyno change puts a heavy emphasis on having a gatewatcher in a pod, a cyno alt in an industrial/recon, a fax alt on standby, etc
---
Only in nullsec. Blackout has increased the risk associated with living in nullsec, this reducing the profitability of operating there through increased losses and barrier to entry. 
---
This forces people into lowsec and highsec, which means new players are introduced to a more lived-in highsec with activities available in a relatively safe environment.
---
r/eve is a measure of players now?
---
"working as intended" welcome to chaos.... Lol
---
Im one of them. Not subbing or logging in any account until this farse is over.
---
This hurt my brain
---
Yep with maxed links you'll tank 7k per rorq, but I think it's safer to theorycraft around the rorq not having links because let's face it, krabs are dumb.
---
Because it says alot about a pilot. Being cringy and hell bent on KB stats is retarded, but I am at a point where I'd prefer to only fly with pilots with a similar amount of skill and experience. zKillboard never lies
---
That's how reading r/eve feels anyway
---
&gt; makes the game harder for bots to be successful
---
fucking lol
---
Corp and alliance mechanics probably going to be the next thing after the removal of POS. So at least 5 more years.
---
They are looking at bookmarks, which is nice, but there is so much room for improvement, like BPO/BPC management, corp hangars (making a hangar accessible for people without the need to get them roles), organising ops (calendar).
---
I still have 4 year old "pending applications" in my corp that I can't delete because of some error.
---
&gt; literally contributed nothing towards the game itself
---
Does the hunted not provide content to the hunter?
---
Bots, WoW, and probably some pouting players are part of the drop. How much of each remains to be determined. Either way, it's not a big loss.
---
Oh look, another Goon spreading fake news and propaganda. Let's all bring back a game where hunters get called out 10 jumps away and the Goons have enough time to dock up their carebears and form the perfect response fleet.
---
The preferred way is with 200 people and it's all Caracas and feroxes
---
If CCP continues aggressively banning bots then that would be expected.
---
nice vid!
---
Yikes, that would ruin the "Eve dying" narrative.
---
Same it is a shit hole.
---
No Vacancies is recruiting!
---
1. 2 this is a trend that has accelerated since the blackout.   
---
3 What ever it is that our former players are off doing it is not acceptable. What is the percentage that will return. We need warm bodies playing.   
---
4 it is now that the numbers should have been growing if one looks at previous years. I think it is weather that pushes europeans indoors and the numbers up but... they still going consistently down.   
---
5 Wars were happening all over and are still happening The one that killed it were those lovely NPC's that popped up just before the black out. Sent all home.   
---
2. 1  PCU = heart beat. Most hard core players running 10+ accounts. So as they leave the numbers dramatically fall. Even more visible.   
---
2 We have no idea but... we need to fix it no matter what to keep the game afloat. Need lots of new fresh blood or the old guard to return.   
---
3 Too much change is not a good thing. Dramatic change is worse. Unsettles people and mob mentality starts taking effect. Bob says it's bla so now I feel it is bla and the contagion takes root.  
---
My guess is we will just have to wait and see what PA does and hope that they have some solution. hundreds of thousands of Korean players?
---
I JUST UNSUBBED THEN RESUBBED THEN UNSUBBED AND RESUBBED AGAIN LIKE ALL THE OTHER NULL BITCHES
---
"But muh narrative"
---
Good idea!
---
That sounds like a really nice feature. Unfortunately, developing it will somehow involve extremely old spaghetti code, and end up fucking the generation of resources in a system. Or something. Highly important.
---
Gates, Jump gates, and cynos not enough movement for you? Jesus. Never live in a WH.
---
&gt;MAYBE IF HALF THIS SUB STOPPED LOOKING AT ONLINE NUMBERS/MONTHLY DATA YOU WOULD ~~HAVE MORE FUN~~ PLAY THE FUCKING GAME.
---
FTFY FOR ALL THE DIPSHITS OUT THERE
---
What the fuck did I just read
---
Why so triggered by numbers?
---
DID YOU JUST ASSUME CAPS LOCK KEY USAGE? HOW DARE YOU THIS IS ALL PLASTERED WITH HOLDING DOWN THE SHIFT KEY
---
Can't we just redirect to classic wow? If the logins keep declining; this may not be an issue.
---
In context though in systems like Igno, or other close to jita lows you'll have cynos going off every few minutes it's not uncommon to have 3 cynos on 1 station
---
In time people might come to accept that the game is just not as fun anymore. Until then they will probably keep blaming bots, holidays, school, and wow classic for a while.
---
Which could easily be attributed to the scale of bans and pouting players, but we don't know. Point is this "it's the blackout" narrative is disingenuous and OP knows it.
---
Huzzah! A man of culture!
---
&gt; Wow classic and new path of exile league, new gears of war.
---
All apparently more fun than EVE.
---
I wish it would’ve started out this way. I feel like they would’ve had a lot more player retention if they would’ve done this from the get go and allowed lowsec to thrive as a place that the crabs preferred because it could’ve been safer than nullsec.
---
But goons are least effected by all this save there are fewer people to hunt. Yet... we are the ones saying loudly.... There is a problem.  It is in our interest to let the status quo be but. we want more people in EVE to play with and that is not happening. Less is not good. Chaos is not good (except to those who have the management to adapt).

---
Those are all valid points. You can only see if the blackout actually improves overall EVE status next summer earliest. It could be better, it could be worse. We cannot say but people putting out torches after this short of time only shows how "used to" people are to changes.
---
Oh right, forgot about that oddity
---
So your argument is that forcing people back into highsec is good?
---
We've told newbies for years that staying in highsec is boring and you should leave to enjoy EVE, and now it's "Muh Injected Rorqual cancer, newbies should stay in highsec".
---
Like Diablo but better
---
they did what? holy fucking shit so glad i already won eve
---
If someone wanted to put effort into it, check the player counts when other PoE leagues launched. I doubt theres much impact
---
Than why did more ships die in August according to Noizy?
---
No, incursion safes are bob’s gift to the community.
---
Maybe, yeah? We already know what forcing everyone to play in nullsec in rorquals is like and what it turns into, and fun it ain't.
---
Attack interceptors can now warp targets 75km away.
---
SOME OF US LIKE TO ACTUALLY USE TERMINAL FULL STOPS LIKE CIVILIZED WRITERS.
---
Meh.  Not my bag.
---
YOU SUCK AT BASKETBALL ANYWAY
---
Multiple new leagues/games out in the last two weeks. Combined with popularity of wow classic ofc numbers drop.
---
&gt;I should have all the time in the world to form up a hunting fleet, but the defenders should only have 1-2 minutes to form up whatever they have on hand and feed. BTW dropping supers is unfair.
---
change minimum warp distance to 75km.
---
[Here are my thoughts on the issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/d1ruql/dr_pculove_or_how_i_learned_to_stop_worrying_and)
---
DONT RESET THE BLUES JUST FUCKING KILL THEM
---
What is a high degree of confidence for you? 50/50? Because that is what a guess is.
---
FUCK YOU FOR NOT USING CAPS LOCK
---
But flair says otherwise :thonk:
---
Yes. Obviously. AF and HAC have both become the meta not because they are great ships but because of that beautiful assault damage control.
---
Except after the 5th time of being told iceberg you find there isn't one.  Then the 10th time you just ignore it.
---
Repeatedly saying something that isn't true doesn't make it true or make a change necessary.
---
&gt; let the strong stay, the weak leave. 
---
let 5k players hunt each other in all of new eden!
---
I'm talking about the time staring at the screen watching the warp animation
---
Duh. It's harder than you think to catch them in lowsec. Have only seen two get caught out of the thousands of attempts.
---
there’s a war in feth? news to me xD
---
&gt;Super jumps they undock the HIC and it's GG. https://zkillboard.com/kill/77162216/
---
[I actually got two supers that time] (https://zkillboard.com/related/30001398/201906071600/) I guess they used two because it was an Ark bait and they were worried about it having ANPs?
---
 shot the pods engines off,he wont disintegrate,it wont go away anywhere..  do you remember battlestar galactica season 2? i think episode 16 or  17  when pegasus was  traped by  multiple basestars,all because  few raptors missing and they were found intact but all pilots/passengers were killed. this could be done to pod,just shot  area where pilot is and pod wont explode,it will trigger the clone activation.
---
question show up there,what if someone else try to board that  pod and manage to fly it home,would be able to recover data of previous flights,explored systems?
---
porn maker is out of work :(
---
That's the entire point.
---
Right now if attackers want something dead they can kill it. No matter what sort of defence the defenders have attackers can keep escalating and as it gets bigger and bigger more people jump into attack.
---
It's far to easy to push into territory. It's still possible to cap drop but you need to accept the costs and be prepared ahead of time instead of just rage pinging for drops in 30 seconds.
---
Now you actually have to plan and prestsge things, sneak in some ships etc and have backup plans instead of taking 10 throwaway CYNO ships because onyl one of them needs to work.
---
MOTHEFUCKING BITCH TITS CLUSTER WHO THE FUCK LEFT THE GOD DAMN FAUCET DRIPPING I SWEAR I JUST HEARD SOME SHIT LIKE BLOOP OR SOMEHTING FUCJK
---
good trick..  stuff  wormhole citadel with station containers and   let it explode and see the results!
---
There are people coming back to the game after very long periods of time. Without it, they would lose all they had, and most likely didn't even come back after seeing this. On the other hand it discourages the aggression, because there's is no material gain in killing structures.
---
Hard thing to balance overall.
---
The "EVE is Dying" propaganda machine kicked into high gear after the blackout went live.
---
And then Goonswarm have always insisted on dickswinging their MER numbers and this just gives them another excuse to do so. There really is no good reason for it, everyone knows they have the biggest economic base, they just can't get enough of hearing themselves talk about how big their economic base is.
---
If you think piloting a JF is an AFK activity then you have never piloted a defenseless 10B ship with 20B+ in cargo into Jita on a Saturday afternoon.
---
I mean i'm not but it seems you guys are by how many post you make about it.
---
aye.  though i dont really consider navy ships as pirate.  they typically (for cruiser, frig, and bs) worse than pirate equivolents.
---
it feels like navy ships should be on par with pirate
---
and t2 be a bit more than pirate.  or it would if tiericide was actually being done
---
Too many equate "lost omega accounts" to lost $ for CCP.  We just don't know how high the correlation is.  Only CCP knows that.  If you had 5-10 (or more) accounts but were multi-boxing them to buy PLEX on the market because it was easy to do so, you weren't putting real money in CCPs pocket.  
---
If you subbed one or two accounts and PELXed a dozen more, but now only PLEX a couple, that didn't reduce the amount of $ you gave CCP.  It only reduced the demand for Plex in the market.  
---
Ironically, in some circumstances lower demand might mean more PLEX bought by the players who sell PLEX for isk to play.  The lower prices mean they need to sell more PLEX for the same isk.  And yes, they did once do this.  Players have been doing it at 1.5 billion, 1 billion and 500 million isk prices.  And they did it when each isk bought less in the way of ships.
---
But neither you, nor I, know the real #s.  Only CCP does.  And realize that they would not have implemented these drastic changes if they liked what had been happening before.  They might still be wrong about what they did, but clearly at least they thought they needed to do something.
---
HHHEEELLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
Oh, I know what all of that takes. I'm saying that when we DO go to war, the krabs that don't deploy deserve to die.
---
Faction Warfare mechanic is a stable system that rewards dscan.  Get into that if you want to learn.  And practice!!
---
I was kind of surprised that this is actually a thing. If I wouldve known earlier i wouldve stuffed the shit out of my station containers the first time I got evicted. It just feels really unreasonable, that theres containers in space that you cannot access or transport to get access,
---
I'LL LET YOU KNOW I DON'T DO BASKETBALL

Harbinger navy is about 175 million t2 fit. 750+ dps with 90k ehp buffer. 600 dps at 30km.
---
Anything tackles and scrambs you, it dies. Yiu can apply to even the fastest of frigates all whilst being able to engage other battlecruisers.
---
When things get to much you spool your mjd and if anyone burns in for tackle you obliterate them with perfect tracking  and jump away.
---
Absolutely love this ship.
---
So many times I have been caught by a fleet scout/tackle. Killed it and left just as the fleet lands. People just seem to forget it can track frigates.
---
PCU is a terrible metric that in now way shows the actual health of the game. What it is, is the only metric players have. It's far too vague to be of any real use considering the type of game Eve is. It's easily bottable, you can scale significantly with alts, and a large portion of the game is ping warriors who fill their downtime with easy and near risk-free PvE. Anyone making any kind of assumptions about the game using the PCU is doing just that, making assumptions. Which is fine, but for fucks sake, recognize it as such. Daily PCU threads are fucking stupid. CCP stated that have other activity metrics that more accurately show what players are doing, and they're happy with those. People pissing and moaning spin whatever they haven't their disposal to make their point seem valid.
---
PoE is not even half the age of Eve and according to Steam stats, PoE didn't start getting large swings of people until about 2015-2016.
---
But yes, I think a comparison of the two over time would be interesting.
---
Yes, and if you think that we are limited to a 32 bit integer you are fucking stupid.
---
I would have loved to see the covert JF cyno too. If people are enabled to transport stuff to have fun with to places to have fun at, i am all fine if this is buffed. Less logistics hassle more fun.
---
I think this was answered in the Frigates of Eve book. Something about the pod being filled with a fluid that supplies nutrients to the capsuleer. The pod also has a filtration system so pods can remain in space for long periods of time.
---
I'll see if I can find the relevant page this evening.
---
Don't EVE players always "go back to WoW!" anyone who seems interested in that game?  Going by this, no EVE player likes WoW, so WoW Classic should have had no effect on EVE.
---
You are not wrong.

GATE CAMP TROLLS GO GANK A ROID SUCKER!  I CURSE YOU WITH PINKEYE!

There's a somewhat sordid history to early PushX - I think one guy was actually in CODE and was using his PX alt to gank high value freighters. This was during the early days of CODE before ganking was super prevalent and 5 bil freighters were still common.  I'm not sure because I'm not in PushX, but I've just heard things.
---
Anyway, someone left who also was CEO of that corp, I imagine, because it was purged from their alliance.  Whoever it is - [might be the GHSOL, guy, the losingest JF pilot in all of EVE](https://zkillboard.com/character/91427140/) - they're not affiliated with PushX at all.
---
" and the occasional KM "
---
I'll keep panciking thanks. I've shifted to high sec for isk making and most of us are just keeping the lights on in 0.0. Honestly the thing that will do it is asset safety.
---
The irony is that blackout and the cyno change hurts Rorquals the least because Rorquals have the tools to deal with them (beefy tank, panic, invulnerable industrial cyno). However what the recent changes have done is smash the ladder that allowed players to climb up to a rorqual/super by making subcap ratting/barge mining w/out Rorqual non viable, while the people who already have rorquals/supers are gucci. That's the worst possible type of change because it greatly entrenches power in those who already have big toys. What CCP should have done is take Rorquals, Supers, and Titans behind the shed and put one in the back of their head.
---
The worm is the biggest plague for frigates in the game.
---
Fast enough to kite, tanky enough to get caught and enough damage to kill any other frigate in the game whilst doing so.
---
You won't get many engagements in a worm because people will only engage in caracals and other rl fits :p
---
YOU DO NOT CROSS!
---
Store them in hangars that only trusted people have access to. If you don't trust them, don't give them hangar access or put them into leadership.
---
You raise interesting points, I don’t know how well the Battlestar Galactica lore imprints on EVE lore.
---
With regards to ‘boarding a pod’, in space, I don’t see how you’d do that: you have swap out the connectors, you have to have the liquid in the pod not freezing solid and, unless you don’t mind or it’s in the typical ‘corpse harvesting’ theme, you wouldn’t mind floating around in the pod with a dead body.
---
But ‘boarding a pod’ has to mean that it’s in space and if there is no infrastructure around the pilot boarding, where would that pilot come from? How is he not dead himself?
---
/not trying to be smug, sneer, dismissive. You’ve raised a question I’ve never thought about as being a ‘unlikely but not impossible’ scenario.
---
If you can sell me on the idea, I’m buying it. I love great ideas that somehow make sense in context. I’m writing a story myself, I’m coming up with new ideas all the time.
---
Tell me how you’d do it, I’ll be your biggest fan [no sarcasm intended at all].
---
Prove what? He gave an example of where less player count is not damaging to the game.
---
I always thought of it kind of like the needle cast in altered carbon except with a few things changed up. also feeding probably done by some tubing inside of the capsule or some solution the body is submerged in?
---
I do not mind other playstyles. I never said that.
---
My opinion is that local in 0.0 was the a balance problem, blackout fixed it and people who left the game because of it, have the wrong mindset. Those are usually the people I described as risk-averse (because why else would they quit if it is related to blackout; which is implied by OP?)
---
You repeat the process, you knock out enough command destoyers and they either have to leave, or you can pin them down... I've been on both ends of this style of fleet quite regularly.
---
It's like a nano fleet, if it's well executed you can moonwalk all over people, but it only takes one mistake or lucky break for the defenders to just crush.
---
Hell, against test the other day they were using neuts to cap out the CMD dessies and then deleting them with megas and haw dreads when their propmod failed
---
A t1 destroyer should get an extra utility choice that shuts off an assault damage control.
---
They are squishy enough to be killed to counter it and they should have to be close in order to do so.
---
Without the ability to disable assault damage controls its pointless flying any t1 destroyer or any other frigate.
---
Assault frigates are generally faster, have more damage and more tank the. The other available choices for the situation.
---
Our fleet was welped nearly to the man...
---
If you had touched my brain, I'd be too addled to even know how to use a puter.

Don't worry who I am, you don't need to know.

HOW DO I TAKE THE CCP GAME SATISFACTION THUMB IN MY ASSHOLE IS THERE A BUTTON FOR THAT
---
those numbers bring us only back to 2006, nothing to worry about

maybe the fact that football started in usa impacted numbers? This is dumb and you are dumb. Stop b8ing with statistics.
---
Killing their own ships WAS THE PLAN.
---
sounds too god for CCP to implement it... and since Hilmar is quitting after the October deal anyway they don't have a reason to in the first place...
---
STOP YELLING AT HIM, HE IS JUST A BOY!
---
What's great about this is if they'd released indy cyno BPOs a week in advance, everyone could've seeded their stations with nereus BPCs and indy cyno BPOs. 
---
Tomorrow, every JF pilot in the game is gonna have to buy their own indy cyno BPO, go to jita, start building a few, then run a br/travelceptor out to their destination to bring the new cynos in before they can start JFing.
---
200 is a small gang according to him and shouldnt be catered to.
---
I think simply deleting the panic module and HAW guns would be sufficient and natural attrition would handle the rest as dreadbombs would become effective once more.
---
Yes, I see the removal of a huge chunk of bots and some cry babies who don't like the fact they actually have to play the game and not just afk rat.
---
Combined with wow classic, new poe league this weekend as well its normal for a game to lose player count.
---
But the point is that such a fleet would MJD and bail if it became apparent they were going to lose, resulting in awful boring gameplay.
---
It's almost like they didn't plan this thing out / realize that would be a problem? CHAOS ERA BTW
---
As easy as clicking the leave corp button as the last member of the corp, then accepting the prompt about shutting down the corp ...
---
Let's bring back the ship spin counter, enable it in space, and create a leader board. I guarantee that will fix it for some people. lol
---
No they are not.          
---
Deep safe spot is something &gt;14.2 AU from celestial.        
---
This can be achieved in multiple ways :             
---
* incursion sites         
---
* mission sites       
---
* anomaly / signature spawns        
---
* utilizing rewarp between any from above and making a spot between                  
---
* last but not least ... manual creation ^(i knew a guy that for 2 months was making a spot in a very specific system running from a very close deep spot and then just moving away from it until he was not visible on dscan any more)
---
As another example, we defended against a pl fleet with jackdaws by using our own booshes to play cat and mouse, eventually we managed to land on them and we made sure to spread scrams out and get all their CMD dessies locked down, and then we brawled it out and finished them off.
---
It's absolutely doable.
---
I think they fixed all ready. 
---
If container have stuff inside it drop inside of that station container what comes out when you pop a structure.
---
No, but it a measurement of people who deny facts on /r/eve.
---
huh? where do you see cheating?
---
Having done every type of farming there is, its a peetty clear winner right now. T5 abyssals make as much isk as supercarrier ratting used to, but with none of the risk, and can be done on a single well skilled account anywhere... There is no motivation to do anything else. Multiboxing rorquals *can* be more, but is way higher risk, and cannot be AFK-ed like before.
---
wait, new GoW??
---
But what about in NPSI forts operating outside provi?
---
THE DEFILED TUBE OF LATEX FLUNG INTO THE NEAREST OPEN FORD PICKUP WINDOW DRIPPING AND FILLED WITH THE ESSENTIAL BODILY FLUIDS CONTAMINATED WITH THE AIDS THAT IS r/EVE
---
Why wouldn't they be a big part of it? They likely have way more time logged in than players.
---
TBf I got a carrier a few weeks back, started ratting and hated every second of it. After maybe 4 or 5 hours I sold it.  Would rather moon mine for a couple of hours a week on a good moon and do a c13 for an hour or two when one appears.
---
Doesn't have the new Invasion items/ships :(
---
&gt;You can only see if the blackout actually improves overall EVE status next summer earliest
---
Pretty sure that's not the case - year-on-year comparisons would be sufficient. Only CCP knows the truth as they are the ones who can see revenue and player subscriptions.
---
That's what he wants you to think
---
I only panic because I don't enjoy seeing the game I like die and the friends I love move on :(
---
Get ready to see it drop massively after this upcoming change, I predict.
---
C4's fucking rule.  Everyone else just haters.  Where else can you crank out 25 T3C's while Rorqual mining?
---
I pre-seeded industrial ships to all potential spots.           
---
Took me 2 days and like 80 t1 industrials.         
---
My assumption is that i will just move a cyno if i come back to EVE.
---
This is well thought out and makes a lot of sense.  Therefore I am predicting it will be either ignored, or misconstrued by those who didn't ignore it.
---
We don't know enough about the details.  And those claiming they know are either using statistics to lie for their own sakes or don't understand the statistics or the economic ramifications.
---
I don't think so because subcap mining/ratting in anoms without local is mechanically very risky and you can't rely on alliance to help you since you die so quickly. Unless CCP adds mechanical safety to subcaps in null they'll just be free feed for blops gangs.
---
Yeah, 2 days of seeding just cyno ships - sounds like fun and engaging gameplay.
---
Eyes forward, capsuleer, the cyno is not yet lit. 
---
Consider your modules, your rigs and ammo before you undock, for the cyno is not yet lit.
---
Break free of the station and witness the universe before you, For the cyno is not yet lit. 
---
Set your ship to fly through the vastness while you wait, For the cyno is not yet lit. 
---
Pay attention, capsuleer, for those who have gone before you call for you to join them. 
---
The cyno is now lit.
---
That's not a bad thing. We need greater attrition. The safest activity in the game should never be sitting in a rorqual with a panic module and a cyno.
---
NO YOU WON'T LET ME KNOW THAT I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU JUST SAID SORRY
---
Found the angry Black Frog alt.  lol @ their cargohold reductions beyond one cyno on route.  
---
Fucking terrible.  It's a t1 industrial, learn to industry. You've had a few weeks to prepare for this, it's not hard.
---
Industry cynos also allow umbrellas to still function amazingly without needing krabs to add any extra chars.
---
Rorqs keep nereus fit with max buffer + industry cyno in SMA
---
Merc mining alt reships into Nereus and lights cyno after rorq is tackled
---
Rorqual hits panic as soon as reship is done
---
Theta/regional equivelent sorts out a handful of bricked Falcon cynos on a blops bridge, ideally already undocked and ready
---
Once appropriate numbers of supers+fax are ready the Falcon(s) bridge in and light cyno, rorquals lock it and assign 7k EHP/s RR per rorq
---
Umbrella lands
---
&gt; spell out that eyes forward poem above the ship
---
This is the most legitimately upsetting suggestion I have ever read on this subreddit, including anything StainGuy has ever posted
---
BECAUSE FUCK MONDAYS AND FUCK YOU
---
A lot of the "so called" drop in "people" online is most likely due to the fact that "accounts online" drop when "people" no longer can "free plex" some accounts -- so some accounts are lost and show up as less "people" online.
---
Not a loss in dollar terms and not a loss of players per se.
---
2322 less nullsec bots logging in.
---
why are you still waiting for something after 15 years
---
are you retarded?
---
Because no one else ever successfully extracts from a fight... I really don't fancy taking away the one tool that lets sub caps engage capitals on an even footing, not with the way things are balanced right now.  You can lock this comp down if you're skilled enough and bring the right tools.  The super umbrella is not the right tool. Fast moving fleets with large numbers of scrams and their own counter boosh is the hard counter of you want to well them. Tracking and alpha is the soft counter... Can't pin them down, but you can drive them away.
---
This is so lame.
---
You're saying "I want to be able to give limited control of an item to another person, so they can use it but not steal it."
---
That's some weak, weak, mechanics that you'll never see in Eve.  You want to loan out an item in Eve - theft is a real possibility.
---
Yeah, these changes are cancer for JF pilots.
---
PCU is NOT a heart beat.  The real heartbeat is the # of live people behind the keyboards who are actually engaged.  If intelligence is perfect and a logged-in account is a bot (or 20) then it is neither adding to the heartbeat nor to the content.  It is merely inflating the isk value and deflating the asset values.   
---
OTOH, if it is a RL player who is no longer logging in, for whatever reason, then yes, it is a loss to the heartbeat.
---
The PCU doesn't begin to give us the answer.  Even CCP doesn't completely know.  But they certainly know a LOT more than we do from PCU.
---
Pick up low sec Cap production. If you're smart you can make some pirate buddies and have real fun with them
---
I QUIT EVE IN 2006
---
I CAME BACK THIS YEAR SINCE ALPHA WAS A THING NOW AND I ENDED UP SUBBING CAUSE I THINK THE CHANGES ARE NEAT
---
IT HAS BEEN 13 YEARS
---
WHY THE FUCK ARE THE STRUCTURE COLLISION BOX STILL MASSIVE PILES OF FUCKING GARBAGE COMPARED TO THE VISUAL MODEL
---
Yep and numbers go up and down constantly.
---
I agree with this, fortunately. The fact that this is probably an accidental fuckup (they legit have no idea this is a problem) means if they ever realize it's a problem they might change it and let JFs use covert *or* industrial cynos. 
---
/u/ccp_falcon you alive? Can you call someone and let them know about this? Just let JFs use covert + indy cynos. It's a small change but will make it a lot easier to run a JF on a new route where you don't already have 500 sigils stockpiled.
---
Oh so they do contribute to the game.
---
Greater attrition needs to be tied to greater reward. If people are just going to feed in PvE without making enough money to recoup losses they'll fuck off to highsec and do T3 abyssal while under the complete protection of concord.
---
This is really my only complaint.  I am largely nonplussed by the industrial hull requirements.  They're cheap and while it generates some industrial overhead in order to supply midpoints or get a cyno hull to certain places, in the grand scheme of things, it's not really that bad. 
---
But: having to switch to a brand new cyno module with zero time to prepare for that is a real dick move.  It would have been nice to have blueprints ahead of time, for sure.  It's gonna suck having to build from 0/0 prints for a few days and spread those around everywhere.
---
The jita holes are almost always camped.
---
I don't think making them closer to AFs in power would be power creep. Unless you overdo it and make the overpower AFs.
---
hey goons maybe active player count is low because there's no conflict.
---
go attack test. stop crying about how bored you are.
---
GO. DO. SOMETHING.
---
If your JF route includes an npc station without industry, the 20k m3 requirement makes it really hard to stock with indy ships :(
---
Started off loving blackout, leeroy's a load of shit, learned how to D scan, got killed and got kills etc.
---
After two weeks or so, it started eating into my income. We couldn't get defence for mining fleets etc. Ended up cancelling 3 barge alts (no rorquals...too poor). Now down to a single account, isk is much more difficult to make. Corp mates had a similar experience and have all downscaled (3 of them have sold their ratting Hels). I know most of the sub will be happy about this, but its effected our corps pvp, we used to do 'fun' fleets like Vigilents/PolarTalos etc. Following the eve everrule of 'don't fly what you can't afford to lose' we've downscaled to Caracals etc.
---
So torn about it, the inital experience was awesome, then the reality/longer term effects hit.
---
Hunters have everything to lose in hostile territory. You can bring a hundred ships, multiple times. Get real bro. Y'all just sad lazy carebears now. That's what you get for poor recruiting standards. 
---
There's also a thing called d-scan and intel channels. Try them. I'm so tired of Goon whining. It's pathetic. Grow a pair.
---
Im upset JFs won't be able to use covert cynos. That was an actual nice change :(
---
The problem is that there is too much reward right now for certain activities. These need to be reduced and blackout is having that effect.
---
Lmao what the fuck happened to you mate. Used to be a solid dude, now are randomly cry posting on reddit about Cyno changes like the rest of these idiots. Morons that are going around typing with heads up arses that conveniently double as an echo chambers. Replacing facts and logic with straight up drivel inducing accusations they find up there.
---
My jf pilot is expired now, also have you seen today's online numbers ? 
---
~17500 pilots at 15:00 EvE
---
("last" working Monday )  ~21000 pilots at 15:00 EVE
---
It's not a guaranteed destructive read, but at minimum it'll fry your brain good. It's more like a "stick your head in the microwave" read. The transfer process injects a neurotoxin to guarantee things so you don't end up in a vegetative but still alive state.
---
This is correct, this is no longer an issue
---
gosh dude
---
There is conflict right now, idk what you're talking about.  The goons wanting to shoot mans have plenty of options right now, just not involving moving our fat fucking superfleet ass around (as if that generates "conflict" anyway).
---
Remove guns. Give them combat scanning bonus.
---
I'd say the highsec recon triglavs have caused more people to quit than blackout.
---
Anyone who spends time in highsec can attest to this. It doesn't just affect the carebear farming krabs but new players and casual players as well. CCP killed the afk game in highsec and there was a large portion of the playerbase that play the game based in highsec. The loss of 2 incursions has also hit the casual/noob incursion groups hard.
---
God bless. Thanks for the headsup, as I was paranoid that I "oversaw" most of the loot.
---
That's very viable for Nullbloc logistics who run the same routes with high frequency. They use the same midpoint fortizars from Jita every run that their alliance set up for them, well stocked with pre-positioned minerals/indy BPO's/cyno BPO's. If there's anyone annoying them on the undock they man the fortizar guns and make them fuck off.
---
For JF services that service more locations less frequently, this is a massive PITA. They utilize far more mids but less frequently per mid. So that's far more places to seed with indy BPC/BPO, and they certainly can't afford fortizar mids like blobs with their established routes can. Gons might see their isk/M3 rate rise somewhat as the JF service has to eat the cost of an industrial per cyno, but independent freight takes a much larger hit from either having to lug/gate industrials and having to seed many more mids. The groups that previous used black frog for logistics also eat shit.
---
That is true and I admit that I'm not looking forward to doing JF couriers in far off places for a few weeks. 
---
It won't be super fun to do but it's just like the old days of null travel before nullified ceptors:  using gate pings.   Build or drop nearby, then gate over as needed.
---
The sigil/wreathe/nereus/badger, however, are also easy to fit with some tank and cloak+MWD, a mechanic which they can perform with ease.  Using T1 modules, it adds less than a million ISK of cost to the hull, and you can also build those on location with cheap BPCs as well and no skill requirements.
---
100 sigils worth of hull is only 60k m3 of minerals, so supply drops will be critical. 
---
 And no doubt enterprising individuals will sell you an industrial hull where you need it for 10-20 million ISK.  The potential for marketeering is also like the old days before rookie ships got "buffed" with more cargo space.  Prior to ~2012 or so, most people used t1 frigates, because you could only reliably use velators as a cyno if you have cyno V, otherwise you had to have a supply of expanded cargohold Is on hand.  
---
Sales of t1 frigates, thus, were found in far flung places, and for the purposes of cynos.
---
If you are trusting then it can be destroyed over night, if you arnt trusting enough then anytime you take decent yet short break. The balance of trust and who to trust is what’s really important I guess. You can’t do it alone but you can lose everything if spies or just simply the wrong person has any meaningful rights.
---
RE your last point:  [https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1+AU+%2F+%2810000+meters%2Fsecond%29](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1+AU+%2F+%2810000+meters%2Fsecond%29)
---
Yeah, I basically put it to my bros I play with - that this change is making an already unfun part of the game, but necessary to drive content, (JF logistics) more unfun to the point I'd rather just not play and go work and save up money to buy a new car or start another hobby.
---
It's really unfortunate that they seemed to listen to a few loud voices initially instead of stepping back and listening to the smaller voices which this change affects negatively in a BIG way. Their best move right now would be to at least postpone it to think about it some more. The ideas people have presented to let both options be there (Indy cynos for newb JFs - lower entry / less risk / more tedious, AND the Covert option - higher entry / higher risk / less tedious / potential content generators for those trying to move covertly - JF kills out of highsec? insanity!).
---
But I'm not holding out.
---
Another play style that dies this way is to to live nomadic and have a carrier just to move your stuff. 
---
Not as high profile, but still =(
---
Believe me, It's a meme more than a true suggestion - but if it kept them from implementing this change who fucking cares LOL.
---
That's some elite gameplay there. It needs to be preserved.
---
I haven't been this happy since I became moderator in /r/pyongyang
---
I know, but this was very special system (a WH) and he was running a perma MWD ship with highly oversized prop.        
---
Nothing possible today he was getting some insane speeds and he was not missing much to this off grid spot.
---
1. Hi Lea
---
2. I calls it like I sees it. It's a dumb change.
---
3. Surprised you would feed me such salt, go fuck off with urself :)
---
If you go to compressed ore, it's smaller still. like 5k m3 of ore.
---
Well, there are those of us who are not returning precisely for the reasons that the guys who are now leaving would return, and we've been slowly leaving the game ever since 2006 when it became obvious that a certain playstyle was slowly getting buffed to the expense of all others. But we don't have the numbers to see which group CCP should pamper to in order to raise player counts.
---
And that brings us to the main problem. PCU at the expense of everything else doesn't make a healthy game, neither does basing balancing of the game on the largest groups because players are not impartial, they are selfish and want to further their own playstyle. If existing players are happy to keep doing the same thing that kills the economy and slowly makes the game boring over the years both for rookies and returning players, it doesn't mean that it should continue this way just to keep these guys logging in. If it's a case of "the game dies either way", you might as well shake things up a bit and try something instead of waiting for the lights to go out by themselves.
---
I'm not saying the situation with player counts is not problematic, because it is. But i certainly don't want to go back to something that was clearly broken either. The problem is not CCP making changes, because they are sorely needed. The problem is that they make band-aid changes and are afraid to look at the real hard ones  (namely, that capital ships are too good at too many roles, resources are too abundant and sov warfare/citadel mechanics need a thorough rework, including asset safety).
---
And judging by the amount of crying generated over the recent changes, i can't say i blame them for being scared of acknowledging the elephant in the room, because the wailing would reach for the heavens if they touched the really important stuff.
---
But even with today's newbie friendly null corps and the massive recruiting drives, the majority of the population lives in high sec. A lot of old, returning players don't want to go back to null either (myself included). They prefer wormholes (because the game mechanics prevent the blobs to some extent) or doing something completely different. For example, i spend way more time on my alt account with my old hauling/trading character and a relatively new exploration alt. My main account that holds my old pvp focused main character sees a very limited amount of action and is not even omega. I just take him out on a public NPSI roam every now and then.
---
In other words, i've been spending way more time on completely different playstyles because i really can't give a fuck about nullsec anymore, and it's not only CCP's fault. It's also the kind of culture that nullsec player entities currently exhibit (and which we see a lot of on this subreddit, reinforcing my belief that it's not worth the trouble dealing/playing with them). I could very easily join one of the big blocs and after a few weeks at it i would even be quite good at specific parts of what they do (nullsec is much easier today than it was when i first went there). But it's not really that much fun, so i don't.
---
Now i'm not saying i'm the majority of the player base, but there are quite a lot of us. Well, you won't get people like us back if you don't shake up nullsec, but screw us, we're bittervets anyway.
---
The real issue is that if you don't shake up nullsec, you won't get any meaningful amount of new blood sticking around either. Sure, a lot of newbies will join karmafleet or horde or any other bloc-aligned newbie friendly corp straight after their career agent missions, but it would be interesting to know how many actually stay. Because the amount of people i see traveling through hisec around the market hubs with one of those corps buried 4-5 lines deep in their employment history is quite big, it's not something recent that happened with the blackout (i've been seeing this for a couple of years) and it doesn't even account for those that simply stopped logging in altogether.
---
**TL;DR** a certain playstyle has become detrimental to the long-term health and existence of the game. CCP will change stuff around to try and reverse that trend. Some of it will be good and well thought-out, and some of it will be hurried band-aids. The players affected may stick around or leave, accelerating the game's demise. It's their choice, but from a game/CCP point of view, there's not really an option. They have to change how things work otherwise the end of the game is a given outcome.
---
Nah m8, I JF for Horde.
---
YOU TAKE A SHIELD
---
YOU TAKE A SWORD OR AN AXE OR A SPEAR
---
YOU PUT IT INTO SOMEONE FACE
---
(ALTHOUGH BE NICE AND USE FENCING MASK SO THAT YOU CAN DO IT AGAIN)
---
&gt;Here's an hypothesis for you: what if it's the amount of multiboxing (or the perception of it) which is/was required to be successful that was driving people away from the game?
---
Have no idea if it's driving people to leave, but when coming back to the game I felt absolutely disgusted by the amount of alts and multiboxing so many people have. My unpopular opinion is that the game should never have embraced this in its design. It being even possible feels like some unexpected jank that got adopted early on, but it being the *optimal* playstyle absolutely ruins the magic of being "a pilot" in the internet spaceship universe.
---
What probably happened is the jackdaws forced the bombers to run and they smacked head first into the titans and got pipe bombed. At least if I read the BR right.
---
your right, all these NIPs and NAPs sure are exciting.
---
what's mainfleet doing today?
---
absolutely nothing.
---
&gt;  They use the same midpoint fortizars from Jita every run that their alliance set up for them
---
I dunno. I know the route the ITL guys use and it's not all fortizars.  I do a lot of JF work myself, in far off places, and I agree, it will be a pain for random locations, but low tier t1 industrials (sigil/nereus/badger/wreathe) are easy to cloak+MWD, so low-sec travel will be easy, and null won't be any different than millions of capsuleers endured just fine prior to nullified T3Cs and ceptors. 
---
I'm not complaining though, other than not having cyno BPOs ahead of time to prepare.  This gives motivated individuals the chance to separate themselves from the pack of clueless morons who do things like die to J Kusion in Jita and don't even know how it's possible.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
&gt; JF service has to eat the cost of an industrial per cyno
---
T1 industrials cost about ~600-800 ISK to build.  It's not a big cost increase.  It is a much bigger *effort* increase, that I cannot deny.
---
What a pickle
---
oh yeah, for sure!  
---
With zero skills and a 50% NPC refinery, you can fit two compressed Sigils inside of a ceptor and still have room for cyno modules (since you can't fit them on the ceptor any more, either).  While they build, go fetch LO.
---
Not ideal but it works.  It's added an interesting "industrial/production" overlay to being a JF pilot, imo, and brought back some of the old gameplay of null gate travel without nullification.
---
Don’t stress, I’m on my way home to login now!!
---
I've been running into plenty of bots in null, don't know what else to tell ya.
---
The bet they are making is that more individual players will stay/return than they will loose to krabbing multiboxers.
---
Generally, for the health and longevity of the game, this is probably the correct strategic decision.
---
Who do I send my $20 to in order to get the 82 titans?
---
There is a lot of dynamic in the wormhole meta between DPS (Leshak) and control comps (Vigis, Dreads, Ewar/Neuts).
---
This fight we opted for full control, whereas AFK went for a hybrid (1 Dread, Vindis/Nestor, Leshaks).
---
The high pressure from all sorts of ewar and the DPS from two nags won this fight, but it's still not clear what comp will emerge as dominant in the current meta. Can the leshak menace be stopped? Only more fights will tell ;)
---
&gt; If you had 5-10 (or more) accounts but were multi-boxing them to buy PLEX on the market because it was easy to do so, you weren't putting real money in CCPs pocket. 
---
Well someone has to buy those Plex first with real money to seed the market. Unless something changed and Plex are now available from npc vendord
---
bring back fozzieclaws please
---
GOD DAMN, THIS COMMUNITY REALLY HAS GONE DOWNHILL FROM ITS NORMAL DEPRAVITY WHEN YOU FUCKS CAN EVEN CAPS UP AND SHIT POST RIGHT!!
---
Has anyone a link where I get Infos about these "cyno changes"? I don't understand the posts about it :(
---
I didn't say it's AFK. I'm saying that you don't get enough benefit from not being AFK when flying a freighter or JF. Like you said, it's completely defenseless and the amount of mitigation you can provide by being on the wheel is minimal, compared to most other ship classes.
---
How about we just get rid of the cyno changes :D
---
I dont understand the question, sorry.
---
Now that everyone did that work they'll announce tomorrow that they took all the great feedback and decided not to do the cyno changes :D
---
I think covert cynos need to be looked at again once all this is done, but I'm sure CCP wants to get away from this reactive style of defense (and offense) where people just wait for a cyno to go up somewhere. They want to see gates being camped, gangs being sent out to intercept other gangs, traps being set up, standing fleets and so on. But umbrellas are so powerful that nobody is going to bother with any of that, so those mechanisms never actually appear. Either you can tank and light a cyno or you don't even go out in the first place.
---
I'm sure CCP is going to hit supercap balance soon but until that happens we're in a broken in between phase where nothing is really there yet. It's a huge shift in a 3 year old meta underway right now and it's going to take time to sort it.
---
No those changes will come now.        
---
I hope that someone at CCP finally notice that game they are try to create is different than game people actually want to play.
---
No. It was the rare fight you got that was quality, making the long run up to it worth the effort.
---
You also don't have to warp around aimlessly. It's possible to do some planning ahead of time and have a specific target to move to, rather than warping around blindly demanding CCP do all the hard work for you. People do this all the time. 
---
This is a game where strategy, planning and preparation is key. If you fail on that, you only have yourself to blame for what follows.
---
Ok, imagine this: if all players that participated in industrial quit the game because the game try to satisfy ganking players, so no ships be build, no new ammo, weaponds and modules are build. So, good luck fighting in a covette.
---
The same with those who ratting, many modules require components from ratting or from DED, no one run that and the price will be skyrocketed, again good luck with covette.
---
Even though you want to pvp, there must be players serve in the war machine as industrial and logistics. Ratting players also help you by spending isk to buy plex and also sell loots for module materials (and contribute their ships as loots when you gank them). You try to chop down one chain, entire system will be down.
---
Gotta pander to those pvp complaints. CCP's orders.
---
Mainfleet is on Querious duty.
---
I'm curious about this, actually. How did your vigis not get permanently neuted out? Seems to me three bhaals should be able to keep four vigis down pretty well.
---
cruise and be max pussy from hundreds of km
---
Meh no the Falcon will still die fast and the response will be split, opening up opportunities for the offenders to escalate and creating risks for the umbrella. Not to mention ejecting an indy adds up one layer of complexity for the Rorqual pilot, few additional steps you can mess up. Once the industrial is ejected it will be targeted, preventing anyone from boarding as well. So it'll actually need to be an allocated indy pilot cloaked around.
---
Cyno changes are pretty good overall for most people who want to kill stuff in space. Including stukas vs umbrellas. They do kill some niches.
---
Most likely not. Since titans can't jump to indy cynos, they won't be able to bridge there.*
---
* CCP code may apply
---
Well, he did end up giving me free stuff (more than my net worth) so...
---
THAT’S AWFULLY RUDE, FRIEND. SOME OF US ENJOY PLAYING THIS VIDEO GAME.
---
&gt; null won't be any different than millions of capsuleers endured just fine prior to nullified T3Cs and ceptors.
---
I'd say it's a good bit harder with an industrial that goes 500 under MWD to dodge a saber than an AF that can hit 2000 MWD. If you aren't out of the bubble and at warp speed by the end of the MWD cycle, you are pretty boned with that long ass align time. However, I think this will only happen once for JF services since that industrial will bring a JF that can drop off compressed minerals/BPO to maintain that mid for a long time. If you don't have access to a mid network from Black Frog/PushX you'll have a very strong motiviation to join them. The two of them might even merge to reduce the cyno overhead, or at least allow cyno sharing.
---
&gt; T1 industrials cost about ~600-800 ISK to build. It's not a big cost increase. It is a much bigger effort increase, that I cannot deny.
---
That's my point, for a high frequency established route, the cost of an indy cyno is far below the cost of fuel. The increase in costs will be marginal. It's probably not even that much effort since they know their route won't change, so some director jumps in a full JF load of conpressed minerals+BPO and puts 1000 industrials in the corp hanger. Everyone else just takes a ship out of the hanger for no more effort than clicking "receive noob ship".
---
https://www.eveonline.com/article/pxf1u0/patch-notes-for-september-2019-release
---
didn't think it was possible to put 2 ancil reppers on?
---
What's great about it, is you had the potential for JF pilots to be covert cynoing in and trying to safe log etc. off of tether / stations, which would have allowed some REALLY dank kills if you were on the ball and watching your space.
---
Now you just get a t1 clownshoe nereus, congrats.
---
Except ADC and removal of nullification didn't happen at the same time.
---
Try again.
---
I’ll make another
---
Small nos have the same cycle time was webs. You can keep them running under infinite neuts.
---
Don't shoot let em burn
---
I laughed so fuckin hard to this comment
---
Report GM's for being GM's!
---
Also, since you seem so upset and it's not "rocket surgery" (lmao), go move your own shit then. You know it's so easy! Get after it.
---
This.
---
If there's no role for a ship, the default response shouldn't be "what role do we give this class of ship?".  It should start with "Why do we need this class of ship?".  Because that either directly leads to a role, or demonstrates the ship should go.
---
When PoE start new league, all items and characters from previous league be dump into standard league and everything restart again. So at least farmers have things to start again and GGG don’t need to worry about inflation in pricing in the way CCP worry. Imagine if EVE reset everything after a period of time, it may doomed entire game.
---
In this case it was a serpentis covert data site. I had an experienced player giving me advice earlier, and he told me to avoid the 'covert' sites. I got greedy and didn't listen. I thought, "there's no enemies here, I'll just pop in and try it out"... then next thing I know there's 10 enemies within 20 km and they've already locked on to me.... RIP
---
I actually made sure to ask CCP whether indy cynoes still show on the map with Tikky Mikk kind of action in mind. Decloaking a recon and cynoing up after the JF undocks adds a few more seconds to his routine but I'm not sure if it prohibits the activity. If anyone can afford a few falcons and HICs seeded to jump routes it is JF gankers.
---
Running around  in a wreathe will be a living torture. I was actually quite happy about the ability of JF's to jump to covert cynos. Why do u make the game already harder for the most bored playstyle in this game? As if waiting for a normal cyno to go down wasn't enough. You should implement new ideas to bring in new players not the other way around.
---
God damn Clownshoe fleets
---
I didn't realize the changes had to happen in the same second for them to be related. It was like 2 months between the changes. I would say that CCP was trying to influence the frigate game play.
---
Moving anything around Eve is gonna be cancer now and I plan to make it as bad as it can be in my neighborhood:
---
1- You use recon to cyno in your cap to a station? I kill yer 400m ISK cyno teeheehee.
---
2- You want to use industrial to light cyno? Gonna get bumped off the undock before you even light and then die teeeheeeheeee.
---
Once this chaos stuff is done null definitely needs a buff in rewards somehow. More incursion style PVE, or move higher tier filaments into nullsec only, or a rework of anoms to make them less predictable but more rewarding, like the abyssal stuff. Stuff that you can't just bot in a myrmidon.
---
Seconded
---
I mean once they light, u can bump the indy all u want, the cyno will stay in place.
---
7 billion... big oof.
---
PCU is chars playing. Only info we really have. What else could one use to judge the environment where we can get an idea of growth or lack of. Everything else is perspective and a judgement call. I see fewer people in alliance, in Jita. Fewer buyers and sellers. I see in 2 months the lowest PCU is 50% of what it was. 
---
So maybe it is not a heart beat but then it could be player pressure. What ever it is the trend is over 6 months constant and now accelerating. Chaos and the Black out has just sped it up. 
---
Something needs to be done.
---
I live in a kickout station so it won't be easy to light. Not safely at least. :)
---
Only a JF can jump to the industry cyno, no other ship can jump to it or bridge to it.
---
Aha, thanks :)
---
Risk is magnitude of loss * chance of loss. When your magnitude of loss is near zero because a bomber is like 50 mil your risk is near zero even if chance of loss is near 100. Look at the fleet that got bosoned yesterday, lost 102 ships for only 12 billion. That's like 3-4 fax kills worth of stuff and 200 man bomber/kiki fleets kills more than 3-4 faxes more frequently than they get welped like that.
---
&gt;and see there are only 10K players how are you going to feel? Many say that less is better. I feel that is not the case as it does not instil confidence that there is growth. 
---
The only "growth" in the last few years seems to have been bots.
---
Found the guy who doesn't understand industry and logistics.
---
That's cool and all, but realize you will just starve yourself of content. If stuff to blow up can't get to where it needs to get, you won't have anything to blow up.
---
The falcon will die quickly to 100 bombers?
---
Oh my apologies then bud. Totally agree with that. Unfortunately you will get that in all groups big and small. There some that don't see beyond there own needs.
---
That’s almost impossible though. 
---
Historically the “solo” players quit whenever the going gets tough, it’s WHY during “chaos” they “came back”
---
They quit when it wasn’t easy for them to win, they’ll quit when they get bored again... the nature of eve is “spreadsheets in space”
---
Not dank drags and zero noscope sniping by your uber frigate play.  (Which will end when there aren’t targets anyways)
---
1. The proposed ability of having jfs being able to covert cynos would have been a nice buff to an under appreciated part of the game, but I can see why it could be overpowered. 
---
2. The reversal of the proposed changes to having an industrial cyno on one of the slowest and least agile of subcaps because people complained about having to train into covert cynos (or the lack of cyno vigils lol) was insanely stupid on CCP's part.
---
3. Having the industrial cynos only on industrials will make logistics much harder because resupplying cynos for mids would be cancer with them being 20k m3, and setting up new routes would require gating very vulnerable ships around in possibly hostile space.
---
4. This change will lead to more stagnation because people will be less likely to want to help do logistics for a warfront or to a sig's staging if they now had to deal with getting industrials set up at midpoints for a new route.
---
5. Keeping the covert cyno proposal and adding in the industrial cyno, or even just allowing the industrial cyno to be fit on all supcaps (minus corvettes) would have kept both sides happy.
---
CCP really needs to reconsider this, or atleast read and respond to the numerous replies on their forums about this change.
---
Lmao, if you think anything about dominion sov was better, you have no grasp on this game. That shit was aids.
---
Citadels are mechanically better in every way than pos or stations, and its never going back. 
---
The only thing they really need to do is change reinforcement timer mechanics to allow the attackers to determine the day a citadel timer comes out of RF, and to have the timers for entosis come out of RF at the same time they were attacked. 
---
And maybe limit the number of anchored cynojammers to 1 instead of 3, would be nice. 
---
Its too easy to spam citadels and entrench into space you barely use and have no actual military control over.
---
My biggest problem is the actual incentives for nullsec now. Theres nothing worth conquering outside of a few good ratting pockets and moons. Actual sov indexes are only usefull for supercap building, jump bridges, and ratting/mining. Moons are no longer a alliance level asset worth having a brawl over.
---
Not positive on who the original writer of this is, but I stumbled across it a couple months ago. Kept it in my back pocket to eventually do, but I probably won’t with the cyno changes. If someone decides to do it though, lmk and you’ll have at least one barge 😛
---
Rorqual panic is one of the best content creators in the game.
---
&gt;Theta/regional equivelent sorts out a handful of bricked Falcon cynos on a blops bridge, ideally already undocked and ready
---
Only JF's can jump to industrial cynos.
---
I mean, the content wasn't really there initially, now it is? Besides where I am at you have no choice to move through the area. 
---
What they should have done, to appease the cap/JF movers, is just have a T1 cyno and a T2 cyno. The T2 operates the way it does currently and can only be fit to Recon/Blops BS. The T1 has a spool up and can be fitted to any subcap. Bam, solves the problem CCP seems to want to solve without "hurting the small guy."
---
&gt; and off you go again
---
No, not at all.  You have to wait a good few hours, maybe until the next day, get cloaky eyes to the chokepoint to see when the camp clears out, etc.
---
Hey, eve streamer here. The truth is that it's impossible to completely avoid being sniped if someone \*really\* wants to kill you. There are locator agents in the game that can be used on you once they know your character name that gives an up to date location on your character (outside of wormhole space) within 4 minutes. Plus, experienced hunters can tell which region of space you're in based on the background nebula. and can narrow it down using the characteristics of the system. 
---
When it comes to streaming eve it's a choice between the quality of your stream and how much you choose to hide. Adding something like a delay to your stream is going to compromise the interaction between you and your audience, but you may feel it's required at times. I think it should be noted that EVE generally is a game which has short moments of high adrenaline, with long moments of not much happening. So the most successful streamers tend to be people who are really entertaining and interactive during the slow periods of non-action while you are looking for content. 
---
I'd recommend checking out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7mDTsIrEA8) which shows you how to blur areas of your stream using OBS. If you want a basic layer of op-sec you'll probably want to cover the system name, overview name column, the area above your capacitor which shows where you're warping to. Name column on directional scanner, local chat which shows which system you were in last, and the probe scanner too so people don't know which specific site you're in. 
---
I personally choose to not hide anything when I PVP, but I also PVP in fast, cheap ships and I'm aggressive. I personally don't have problems with stream snipers outside of specific areas of space I've been in for awhile where they are watching my stream. It's probably because I'm usually not flying a ship which is worth the effort, but I think it's also about the attitude you have too. If you are someone who rages or gets salty over losses you'll probably end up having a lot more people putting in more effort to streamsnipe you. There's a reason why people went out of their way to streamsnipe Chessur, where as Bjorn Bee doesn't have nearly as much problems with stream sniping. If you stay positive and just gf/or make it into a funny situation it's less likely to happen again and the people watching are more likely to bring you content.
---
We only have data that we see.        
---
At 15 EVE we had like 17.500 players today.          
---
Last working monday it was 21.000 at the same time.
---
Blobs can jump /light bridge to Indy cyno
---
Just 1.  Didn't realize I needed 500 until after I purchased it.
---
I find High Sec to be a bit boring, but lack the skills (real and character) to survive elsewhere.  I really need a team to fly with to get my skills good.
---
How about we just get rid of the cyno
---
Pretty sure the solution here is just to use freighters w/ chain's of titan cannons pointing at covert cynos. 
---
It is the belief of CCP_DEV's that this change will have a positive impact for the smaller less established players.
---
Well, ok then. I missed that part.
---
Well the Resubs run out in october, and the data says the active playerbase is cratering, so in 1 month, we'll know for sure.
---
This is a bad thread.
---
Because of blackout?          
---
It is more about that with player base shrinking so fast, well ... it will be harder and harder to find stuff to fight, shoot so more people will quit.
---
Apparently I was indeed wrong and will need to review the patch notes on the module.
---
A couple of old alliance mates poked me about your post last week and asked me what I thought. Out of curiosity, I kicked my little Snapcount program in the shin and it produced this:
---
http://jestertrek.com/eve/players/eve-players-2019.png
---
http://jestertrek.com/eve/players/eve-players-fouryear-compro.png
---
As a reminder, this data is based on Daily Average Users (DAU) over the course of a full EVE day, not Peak Concurrent Users (which I find is not a very useful metric). The data shows a few interesting things:
---
* Both of the large up-peaks correspond with long CCP giveaways to EVE players, the December peak being the "Yioul" giveaway and the May peak being the EVE anniversary giveaway. Once the giveaways end, the DAU drops off a cliff.
---
* As far as I can tell, there are no upturns over the last 12 months associated with player activity (a war, for example).
---
* The brief sharp downturn in mid-July corresponds with the first three days of Blackout.
---
* These DAU numbers are the lowest my little program has ever recorded since I first started running it (yes, the numbers are lower than the horrible numbers of both 2015 and 2016), and represent the lowest DAU EVE's had since 2006.
---
* About 66% of the downturn is represented in the AUTZ from roughly 0100 EVE time to 1100 EVE time, which I (without data) would ascribe to Chinese EVE players no longer logging in in vast numbers. The rest are losses in USTZ, which is severely impacting logged in players from 2000 to 0100 EVE time. EUTZ average users are somewhat impacted -- particularly in the last week for some reason -- but not as much as the other two TZs.
---
Most of the data at http://jestertrek.com/eve/players/ is up to date through yesterday (the rest is updated through Sep 1) if you want to browse.
---
No, I'm not back. No, I haven't been playing. I just got persistently poked by a couple of EVE friends who wanted me to produce this data so here it is. Do with it what you will. ;-)
---
You think having to grind through however many hundreds of citadels with damage cap is better than grinding a defined number of POSes and stations?
---
Do you think it is a good thing that station undock games no longer exist? That it's no longer possible to camp a station due to tethering? Even entosis was acceptable when you could sovwand a stations cloning facility in order to force a fight.
---
The biggest problem with Dominion sov was that supercap fleets could be anywhere in eve in a matter of minutes. When jump fatigue was introduced it fixed the biggest problem people had with dominion sov and nullsec flourished with small groups.
---
Agreed. There should be a low entry level / high entry level alternative that balances risk vs convenience.
---
Ccp want to inflate prices so people are encouraged to buy plex. Reducing resources in null would accomplish that.
---
Wow
---
Per patch notes
---
&gt; Industrial Cynosural Fields can be jumped to by Jump Freighters and Black Ops Battleships.
---
Supercarriers cannot use fighters
---
Eve's official website
---
Started reading expecting some retarded idea, but this one fits well within their supposed role as scouts. Though I would rather see it on Combat Recons instead of their d-scan immunity.
---
“please don’t argue about blue loot”
---
when 99% of the changes favor wormholers’ playstyle you can kiss that request goodbye.
---
How about we just
---
So then, now there was risk?
---
Yeah that was recently added I believe. Still doesn't help with logistics.
---
Right out of the patch notes linked above: Industrial Cynosural Fields can be jumped to by Jump Freighters and Black Ops Battleships.
---
Did they change this again since the notes were released?
---
In this thread. Plenty of places to do that elsewhere.
---
Well, since people abandoned combat interceptors before the ADC was released, that would kinda indicate it wasn't the ADC that caused the problem.
---
you genius man!!!
---
 Added Industrial Cynosural Field Generator.
---
* Can be fit by Industrials, Deep Space Transports and Blockade Runners.
---
* Industrial Cynosural Fields can be jumped to by Jump Freighters and **Black Ops Battleships.**
---
* Requires Cynosural Field Theory I to activate.
---
Warp to an instaundock then back to a cyno bookmark?
---
Nice. These smaller sized fleet fights with comms are my favorites for Eve pvp videos. Cheers o7
---
Fairly certain it was arbitrarily selected anyway, as python doesn't really care about number sizes.
---
&gt; "How big should d-scan be?"
---
&gt; "Eh. Max 32bit int or something?"
---
Was likely the conversation that took place.
---
Reading comprehension isn't your strong point is it?
---
abyssal makes more money per hour if you do frigate sites, which obviously become safer and faster if you bring in 3 frigates instead of soloing them. 
---
And ded sites are similar, where a second ship can speed things up considerably. I know many people do black ops for ded sites since you can go out scanning in a normal cloaky hacker and then just jump the blops to the high level site.
---
I personally multibox my isk making. My current strategy actually reduces the ISK/hr/character multiboxing over going solo, but it's still more with the 3 characters than solo (2.5x roughly).
---
If I got better at multiboxing I could get it up to 3x but I run them all together so it's easy to keep track of what is going on in system, but maybe one day I can just split them all up.
---
I think you're on the right track to answering your own query. Find a group that has the kind of activities you want, in the space you want to fly in, and then you'll find yourself with significantly more content than piddling around in hi-sec.
---
There really isn't any way to know how many actual humans that represents.  It could be as much driving out bots (a good thing) and 20 boxers (an "almost as good" thing) as anything else.  The only people who really know are the people who are making these changes.  They know how many actual humans are playing.
---
If they see those numbers going south in a serious way, they're going to react, unless their earn-outs with their new overlords don't mean anything to them, which I doubt.
---
You're operating with imperfect and incomplete information to create a narrative that supports the changes you'd like to see.  I'm sorry that you don't like the blackout.
---
But you can always play Standard
---
Is that really ccp's belief? Or did they just not think at all about the change and we're wildly flailing their arms around looking for dumb solutions?
---
not remove the players, just  create chaos and have a good time.
---
How
---
&gt; having account subscriptions plummet as a business model is about as effective as a restaurant manager personally spitting in everyone’s food
---
Possibly, but also I'd prefer that CCP not make decisions purely based on cashflow, so long as the existing cash flow can sustain the project.
---
I'd much rather they make decisions for the health of the game, which may require short term losses but secure the long term, while pure cash grab tactics will make more money in the short term but hurt the game long run (think skill injectors)
---
I hear you, but previous attempts amounting to
---
Others:  here is a frigate, get good...
---
Me:  and I'm dead again..
---
I'd like to go with scenario number two. Rolling heads across keyboards as they code would also be a fair guess.
---
Sounds like some form of patriarchy in Eve that needs to be smashed. Where so we form the protests?
---
Well, I guess if you have 10 alts you could bridge 10 to the next halfway point - but not near as far as a JF travels.
---
More ganks
---
If you blackout everything and make highsec into shitty nullsec without bubbles, bombs and smart bombs, nobody (or hardly anybody) from highsec will play.
---
&gt; T5 abyssals make as much isk
---
How much is this? a google suggest around 200-300m/hr?
---
The price of BITCOIN is an absolutely fucking awful way to judge the economy and gives little to no insight, ***but***, if the motherfucker drops 10,000 points I can guarantee tech companies such as Nvidia are going to eat shit from it. What I'm saying is that while in micro scale, no, the information is not necessarily dependable. On the macro scale significant moves can ***most definitely*** imply a shake-up in related variables.
---
&gt; Need proof that the blackout isn't growing player count?
---
Did anybody say it was?
---
these tears are amazing
---
welcome to the exact situation the entirety tor non nulkbloc Eve by was in for 5 fucking years
---
are you that much denial? is it really not obvious to you the game is eating shit from these changes?
---
&gt;Pretty sure the solution here is just to use freighters w/ chain's of titan cannons pointing at covert cynos.
---
???
---
Titans can't bridge to anything they can't jump to, so I don't see why this would work, unless I'm misunderstanding what you're saying here.
---
Give them a bonus to neut resistance, so they can be used to scramb tackle big ships that run neuts.
---
I'm not a real multiboxer.  But I've let one account lapse, and my other account will lapse in Oct.  I won't renew if Blackout is still in effect.  If it's gone by then, I'll likely resub the second account.  So by Nov, I'll be in with two accounts or completely out, finding a different hobby.
---
Not interested in Blackout apologists, don't bother.  If it make you feel better to insult me, have at it, I suppose, I don't care anymore.
---
I think it's a fair point though.
---
That blackout's effects can influence the PCU without anybody actually unsubbing.
---
His point is just that this single statistic doesn't actually tell us much.
---
Yeah, could you re-write your sentence using actual words? I don't really understand what you are trying to get across.
---
Why would I insult you? It's your money to spend on activities you enjoy.
---
May I ask what activities you did do in Eve?
---
Blops can jump and bridge to them
---
Honestly they just need to be a sniper...just give them a very long range platform and keep everything the same.
---
It is the exact opposite. Isk is being generated at a lower relative rate to resources than ever before. Rorqual continue to enjoy a large degree of safety (except for their excavs) due to panic while isk generating ships have significantly more risk.
---
But what would we do instead of playing the game?
---
H
---
Make memorial cynos lightable anywhere so Chremoas pilots can BM 1 day old t1 frig pilots when they totally frickin rekt them inside a novice plex in solo combat with cloaked logi on standby can I get a hell yeah brother?
---
I dont argue on tangential details when people are overall wrong on r/eve anymore :)
---
We are expecting lots of new opportunities and a field day in umbrella space but it would take too long to go into details hoping to convince you.
---
This looks pretty fun to try. lol
---
Bold of you to assume r/eve is the source of all ~~evil~~ autism. ~~Evil~~ Autism isn't made here. It isn't born here. r/eve merely contains it. To delete it, some place else would become the host of ~~evil~~ autism.
---
ITALIANS ARE JUST TRASH AT THIS GAME. WHY STOP THERE THO? ALL EU TZ SUCKS BALLS.
---
BFG Titan pilot here: was a lovely day. Happy to see you all into Valhalla
---
nah, see.
---
Complaining far and wide that EVE IS DEAD is a self fulfilling prophecy.
---
If you complain it loud enough that people start to believe it, you guarantee it happens.
---
And these people want to be right and for CCP to be wrong more than they want the game to be good.
---
I BURNT MY GRILLED CHEESE.
---
FUCKING CCP
---
&gt; What it is, is the only metric players have.
---
We also have the MER.
---
And so far there isn't too much to suggest the blackout has had much repercussions beyond exactly what the intent was (a riskier nullsec)
---
good idea but I'm still in trash talk monday mood so no, fuck this shit game literally unplayable.
---
The null "isk faucet' in terms of isk injected in regards to "inflation" was always easily adjustable, but CCP didn't want to. The "easy fix" is to reduce rat bounties and move part of the reward to LP for finishing an anom. LP is an isk sink so inflation could be easily controlled by the double whammy of both reducing bounties and increasing LP sink.
---
HELL YEAH BROTHER ELITE PVP *slams a Monster energy drink*
---
I think this tracks pretty well with my POV on things. Honestly I'm totally fine with the anti-chaos threads. I think there are a lot of thoughtful feedback to be found in those threads. However when someone brings up PCU numbers I can't help but roll my eyes. PCU pearl clutching threads are the living embodiment of the phrase "there are lies, damn lies, and statistics".
---
P.s. for anyone not familiar with the phrase it doesn't mean that PCU threads are liars but a commentary on how numbers, particularly statistics, can be used to bolster weak arguments and make them more persuasive than they actually are.
---
I think CCP should be less heavy handed on the logsitics end of this and agree with your proposals. 
---
JF's help make content happens for large groups of people. Making them a pain in the ass will not make the game more fun for anyone involved except annoying low sec people that get off on killing a cyno worth 1mil more.
---
Fair. All these posts fail to acknowledge there are multiple reasons for the data that people are ‘reading’. 
---
Not one person I know has quit during blackout. I do however know quite a few who have come back.
---
**Later edit:** I did some simulations on sisi and it seems that the only implant set that substantially improve something on this Loki is the  **Ascendancy** set. For like under 1B (the mid set) I can increase my warp speed for 3AU which is significant. It can help me cover more ground faster and shake off if needed.
---
The Genolution set is indeed used more for fitting purposes. The mid grade helps me get only 1k ehp for 1B set. Too much.
---
Snake seems fun indeed but I get somewhere around 200m/s and Nomad is even worse.
---
They've said before that dscan is the single largest load generator in the game. They are never going to increase dscan range for anything ever.
---
I do a little of most things - little mining, little ratting, little fleet pvp (funded by mining/ratting), little exploration, little industry, little mission running.  I'm not going to go full autist on any activity, so I'm not going to be able to make serious industry or exploration money.
---
Given that mining/ratting funds everything else, I'm grinding to a halt.  As it stands, mining/ratting can only reasonably be done as a fleet activity.  It's WoW raids (in terms of the pain in the ass of assembling the people for the activity) without even the WoW raid entertainment level.  I'm not going to buy plex to fund anything, so I'm about done with the game in it's current incarnation.
---
well "accumulation player" are bad for the game health they dont offer any content live in big NS bloc in "security" i dont think you can keep them in NS if you want a more interesting/living NS   
---
but i think that's the mentality behind keeping your asset the problem and not "those players" it would be great if CCP break this by removing asset safety and increase every isk gain IG but you will loose everything sooner or latter, even the Titan/Super a taxe based on the hull to force people to fight with them and not just bashing some structures could be a good thing
---
Lots of Quafe™, Protein Delicacies, canned peanuts, cigarettes AND NOTHING ELSE. This explains why everybody is so cranky.
---
That's very true. The MER, security report, and PCU all in combination can be used to try and get an idea of the state of the game, but it's still grasping at best. CCP seems happy with their results and appears to be flexible (adding Indy cyno, talking about increasing null rewards if blackout disincentives too many players) on some things and on a reasonable timeframe.
---
at least it would be  nice killmails.
---
I think nullsec is broken as long as both sides can avoid gates to the degree that they do today. Defenders avoid them with umbrellas and ansiblex gates and jump bridges, attackers avoid them with blops gangs and wormholes. Choke points are meaningless. Being deep inside your own space doesn't provide you any additional safety. Gate camps are mostly ineffective. Defenders can't intercept attacking gangs and attacking gangs can't out-maneuver defenders. Neither side can trap the other side into a pocket or even pin them down reliably.
---
And importantly intel is almost useless right now. Some no-name cyno alts flying around can suddenly turn into 100 bombers, that suddenly can fuck off again to some other system without ever using a gate. Meanwhile the attackers have no idea if any defense fleet is on the way or where they're coming from because again, they appear out of nowhere. 
---
I want to get to a place where if you're 20 jumps inside your region and your alliance has control over certain choke points and a standing fleet out intercepting any gang that shows up, then you should be reasonably safe. Because you know 100 guys can't just appear out of nowhere. And if that means adding some way to limit where wormholes can spawn then so be it. I don't mind fighting my way into a region as long as that option is there.
---
Gigx is Serbian, so not totally unexpected. Eve attracts sociopaths from all over the world.
---
If people aren't shooting the jita monument, you're not chaos-ing enough.
---
What kind of ships do I need to bring to kill a 150k+ EHP/s recon cyno before caps can jump to it? What happens if they back the recon up with another cyno once a FAX lands?
---
Should you just bring enough people to break active tanked FAX super quickly? If you cannot form 100 bombers should you just not bother playing?
---
You posted this twice with two different accounts. Was it that important?
---
Tell me, Mr. Anderson: what good is pvp if you're unable....... to re-ship[?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWBntJAvTmY)
---
Except CCP gets paid based on "character count", not "player count".
---
Hilmar sucking all the WH cock. XD  
---
Seriously though. Fuck Hilmar.
---
I got the gist 😂😂😂
---
You see there's your problem. Your gameplay experience is entirely limited to nullsec as part of your sov-holding alliance. Pre-fozziesov you could have done mission-running in highsec and lowsec and there were public incursion running groups in highsec where you could have plexed your accounts in a manner of hours.
---
The reason we don't see this things as viable sources of income, why the groups which used to perform these activities don't do so any more is because highsec and lowsec have been depopulated due to the outsized rewards which have been available in nullsec. This is he reason Plex climbed from 300 million isk in 2012/2012 to be over 2 billion isk pre-blackout.
---
?
---
You will be missed !
---
Anyone who takes a long break from Eve and doesn't move their assets to high/low stations kinds deserves to lose their stuff I feel.
---
That would mean we'd have to log in though and play, no one really wants to do that anyway atm haha
---
code. post =instand invalidated.
---
Who

none of these looks like they can be accomplished with some quick database changes
---

---
Jebaited.
---
They are definitely furries
---
Move lol.
---
t. CCP
---
If you want to collect items or min max your build with items that no longer exists you can play standard. But in general almost players choose league because league contain new contents, new league-specific items that may require several months for standard players to touch to it, also league mechanic is more fun than play in standard (some league mechanics are nerfed or changed before officially added to game). And market is more active and profit. Standard market like EVE market before BO, inflation increase dramatically because all currency flow to it from death hardcore players or previous league; also very few players will trade with you. League market is fresh market, if you active in the first week of the league you can get enough currency to fully invest to your build.
---
:D
---
A man can dream that CCP actually get up from their armchairs and add something new to the game but I guess not
---
People leaving because of a broken intel / chat mechanic is just very odd to me.
---
Only if all areas acted like deadspace, so you'd have to warp onto the local grid, but within some amount of kilometers from the target and then have to burn in the rest of the way. 
---
Make entering warp take longer/use different mechanics than aligning and we'd have more and longer fights.
---
A Falcon with a lit cyno has a pretty good chance of dying to 50 bombers alpha. Maybe 60 if there are a lot of t1 users.
---
Would you say it's more expensive to fit a ship and plex an account than it has been in the past?
---
Yay Capitals Online!
---
You are what's wrong with the game. It's a fucking sandbox. Complaining that people aren't playing the game like you want them to play is none of your business unless you pay for their accounts
---
I dunno, we are seeing a lot of Praxis in Null.  Usually a fleet of 3.
---
Mostly the kiki and drek, the rest seem mostly okay.
---
```Recons don't even need to be suicide unless you're tackled by a super ***large fleet***```
---
60+ bombers is a large fleet.
---
Saw that fairly recently I think. Have also seen someone using a Nestor to run HS data sites... wtf?
---
I like the idea of a "Submarine."  
---
The ship name "Kronos" is already taken.  https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Kronos
---
essentially it would be bringing the best parts of null-sec to high sec for a short window of time. chaos + no bombs, bubbles or bosons to interfere and the lack of local and concord makes it interesting when something pops up on you and you have to react and use the tools already available to you.   
---
the other side of that would be that people continue as normal in high sec not even noticing whats going on.
---
So toward which weapon type one should go if he would like to play some inc/inv/fw and later pvp?
---
Oh, so then my suggestion of giving them a buff to dscan duration is moot then huh.
---
It's funny that you mention that because in early 2018 bitcoin did drop 10,000 points. Meanwhile .IXIC was hitting record highs. So no, in the macro Bitcoin prices are completely irrelevant and one number can't give you even a glimpse of what is going on in the macro scale of things.

---
It's alive and well.  People are on the "Eve is Dead" train because they got their free Null Intel taken away and it's severely curtailed their income because they are refusing to undock and actually....play the game.
---
These players are the soft underbelly of eve...who thought they were "elite" but simply cannot fathom how to carry on and be badass null pilots without a broken game mechanic to ping them from eating cheetos and watching netflix while they rat in drone/fighter ships.
---
It doesn't particularly matter.
---
If you had 5 accounts to multibox a bunch and then cancel 4 of them, CCP is making a lot less money from you.  There's also a lot less targets in space for people to attack.
---
Those are the big problems from the ChAoS ErA crap, and saying "but they're doing more solo activities" doesn't fix them.
---
Nobody would undock unless they're looking for fights. Genuinely, how many highseccers have you seen that would want to be possibly gatecamped and ganked on undock?
---
Where did the concept of risk reward go? High risk, low reward?
---
How did you arrange this fight?
---
BECAUSE OF LONGSTANDING TRADITION GOING BACK TO THE DAYS OF PEDANTIC_PENGUIN FROM LONG BEFORE YOU WERE EVER A MOD OF THIS SHITHOLE

---
-50 Social Credits, you can no longer use your bank account Citizen.
---
do plex come from NPc or from people buying from ccp/3rd party stores
---
if it is from ccp or the 3rd party store then those 10 accounts is $200 someone has to spend
---
this idea that plex accounts aren't a paid account is just stupid 
---
also less char equals less targets, now if they are bot then i agree it is no loss for the game but if it is an honest player then ity is a loss to the game
---
So what would you advise for some inc/inv/fw? I dont know what is "meta" atm. Last time I played nobody has heard of FAX, not to mention Abyss or others minor changes :P
---
It's still a sandbox. Adapt or leave. Nobody cares.
---
What about a buff to combat scanner probes? Still a scout, and still tackle, but not enough DPS in most cases for a solo kill.
---
So cry about bombers and not the blackout. Apples and oranges my friend. Kiki fleets can't cloak. Cry about cloaks. For fucks sake you make up shit to try and justify your disgruntled argument with a blackout. Down vote me all the hell you want, but we all know the oned leaving are simply sad ass clowns who wanted complete control of their risk. Sorry, bruh. Eve is not that.
---
You can thank your fellow JF pilots for CCP's decision to go the indy cyno route.  Your fellow JF pilots bitched, whined and complained about the initial offering--the covert cynos, so they changed their mind and decided to go with the current plan. :/
---
Ok, just another troll.
---
¿
---
The plex is paid for - but assuming that the people that currently/previously used it are the only ones that would is just stupid.
---
If plexes dropped in price I guarantee that alpha pilots would end up subbing with them, instead of the multiboxed rorqs/VNIs
---
I still feel like the swiftest way to make a fair and believable fix is having player structures influence a background sec status that controls NPC behavior. This could be implemented everywhere actually. Over time the number of players active in a system based on their activities will shift the security status of it is a sov system. Spending all day ratting for a month will cause rats to basically disappear or drop to the same class of rats that show up in Hi Sec. Moon mining can stay as is but belts and anomalies will shift in frequency based on the frequency in which players clear them. It would take some balancing on the algorithm side but this would force players to travel more and intrude into other sov territory for the null bears and also push care bears to venture further a field to find PvE content.
---
And they made us hit d-scan every few seconds in nullsec?
---
You are right. It's a huge fleet. Epic.
---
Welcome to eve where high risk and 0 reward exist. Nothing is risk averted you can still be killed in high sec every day and there is no guarantee that you'll be rewarded for anything you do.
---
I literally could not cringe any harder.
---
Have a corpmate that rejoined because of blackout and he is doing quite a bit of solo work out in Null.
---
And to this regard, selling in nor near NPC null $$$
---
It looks like there are built in royalties for amazon merch.  That is cool, but not quite what I want to subject my group to, or figure out taxes on :).
---
Before the changes we were bringing 7 naglfars to kill stuff in Delve. Now we will have to rely on large stuka fleets more, and switched our activities toward that direction. When you think about it, it is much more valuable for the game if  the capital-killing meta under heavy umbrella space is mainly about crowded fleets. It is much more democratized and bringing fun to many more people.
---
In our case we just adapted our role into brokerage of kills. We take horde bombers to kill Goons, take Goon bombers to kill TEST. And by "we" I mean folks from DPCI (I've been afk for a while). The way I see it, it's a service.
---
A 30 man bomber fleet didn't have much chance under the umbrella before the changes. It won't have much after. But even with a 30 man fleet you can actually feed on recons system after system, potentially causing the entire region to dock. This wasn't possible before the changes.
---
What sub should I be on
---
&gt;Ccu 5 is usless.
---
If you import, CCU5 is not worth it. If you extract P0, CCU5 is a must. You can significantly up your production because there is a set base Power needed to set up extraction and production plants, anything above that base power needed is directly related to how much P0 you extract and convert.
---
Its not really about how many alts it takes, its about the way those alts are used. The changes increase the number of alts needed,  but even that doesn't eliminate the risk. So multiboxers have to commit more to only marginally get what they were before. And also it means that the alts have to actively defend, not just be scouts.
---
The blackout and cyno changes allow ganker counterplay that gives them a realistic chance at getting a kill, whereas before there was nothing. Even if you have standing fleets, cyno jammers, gatescouts, etc... A ganker can still light a covert cyno. And even if you have a cloaked recon on grid, they cant tank a blops fleet long enough to allow free reinforcements. Even if both sides play perfectly, there must still be a contest where either side can make mistakes.
---
Thus, the only defense is having active subcap pvp fleets defending your space, and while effective, is not a gurantee of safety. Which is all PVP players want, and which is good for the game as a whole.
---
It's like reporting Hilmar for being Hilmar.
---
Nah, I'm gonna thank CCP for listening to one side of an argument rather than trying to reach out and get a full viewpoint from their playerbase that these changes affect. It's not the fault of those that they don't see the big picture. Who knows if those guys bitching even JF.
---
Agreed, though one interesting metric I would like to see is the quantity of ships destroyed vs. the average value of ships being destroyed. If imagine that it wouldn't be a good sign if the value stayed the same while the quantity dropped. Though that lends itself to other questions like "are people just better at evading others since blackout" or "is the rise in cloaky ships skewing the quantity destroyed".
---
&gt; Tomorrow, every JF pilot in the game is gonna have to buy their own indy  cyno BPO, go to jita, start building a few, then run a br/travelceptor  out to their destination to bring the new cynos in before they can start  JFing. 
---
dear Lord. Eve players actually having to use their initiative!
---
Give them a damage buff and add a 10% warp speed &amp; acceleration bonus per level. This would make a lvl 5 pilot aggressive and fast, being able to cut off targets.
---
So come in ships other than cloaky nullified cowardfits. You can't fly ships designed to not fight then bitch about not getting fights.
---
WHY IS THIS GAME STILL NOT DEAD?
---
Since your resub is running out in October, can I have your stuff?
---
(I know people are sick of me asking but it'll work one of these days)
---
Anyone jumping to a lockout station deserves to die.
---
Hmmm... that's way too few datapoints to conclude, way to many uncontrolled variables influencing said datapoints. Weather, regional holidays, wars, bots not being logged in. It either needs more data points or more known variables to mean anything.
---
I wonder what the outcome is if you were to run a statistical test on the data.
---
Is there an Esi endpoint for avg daily sales or something?
---
Yeah, it was pretty tasteless.
---
You better not automate it either.  That's why they added the delay, btw, to reduce the amount of scans per second the server had to deal with.
---
You should seriously think about what you post before you post it.  For some folks, this is a pretty sensitive issue.  Some of us have lost friends--close friends--that we used to fly with.  To those folks, "that eyes forward poem" is a lot more than just an "eyes forward poem."

That’s what I was thinking.  This time of year is always low numbers.   It might be a little lower than normal, but once it gets cold and people don’t want to go outside, they’ll resub accounts,
---
I blame every whiney bitch who complained about needing to use a cov ops cyno, that was a perfectly reasonable change that was rejected vehemently so the community fucked itself with this one. O sympathy garnered.
---
Lol
---
Consider your modules. Those who have won eve call for you to join them. The industrial cyno is now lit, bridge your recon then rep said recon and pray it lasts long enough to bridge in a backup recon. Now the fuckin cyno is lit, GET UP GET UP AND GET DOWN.
---
I think it's just sad how BFL is taking advantage of the wallets of their customers. I have never used them and I never will, as I've almost exclusively handled my own/my corp/alliance logistics for over a decade. 
---
But BFL already charged the the highest prices for the lowest allowed m3, 320k, and now they have increased pricing further while reducing the m3 down even more. It's just awful.
---
PushX increased pricing, but still offers the same m3, and offers rush service, too, and all for less than Black Frog. It's embarrassing.
---
Does phorde still preach the slaved arks with half full cargos and a-types for their JF logistics?  Valhalla, iirc.
---
Well, as soon as you cant drop a super fleet on every roaming gang that tackles a ratter, i will
---
It is flawed because bigger doesn't mean you win automatically. I can kill a battleship in my cruiser. And your moronic equation means that because my opponent bought his Battleship with real life cash and is bigger than my cruiser he is automatically going to win which is not true because how you fly and the other circumstances that you're not factoring in play a role on whether or not bigger is better.
---
You are dumb. Quit posting.
---
Yep, which is old supercarrier ratting money
---
With the cyno changes, a rorqual will have a much harder time doing exactly that
---
Nah, salty goons gonna salt.
---
Boohoo blackout
---
It won't allow bridging, go on the test server any tey for yourself.
---
Blackout hasn't fixed the balance issue at all it shifted it to favour the hunters they now have all the free intel be it in game or out of game. 
---
it has given rise to the risj adversed pvpers
---
Thank you!
---
I have made an attempt to reverse my mistaking by renaming the Gallente T2 Titan (Flagship) to Atlas to reflect its importance as a force multiplier in supercap fleet.
---
This is how you get a cyno up in places like Tama and Faspera, that's for sure. Gotta use your brain to get those bookmarks first, ofc.
---
Two questions on that.
---
(1) Changing bounties impacts isk but not risk, so doesn't quite hit all the design goals. Also, reducing bounties will require people to take more time to PVE, which doesn't necessarily seem ideal. Higher-value but riskier PVE might be better at getting people to stick high-cost assets like rattles and carriers out there. Maybe short duration sites that are tough, with extremely high DPS and perma-scrams, would incentivize short bursts of high-value, high-risk activity? Incursions generate similar sorts of higher value "burst" PVE activity when they show up in your neighborhood.
---
(2) I like the idea of getting something for finishing a site, but also recognize that bots have infinite patience - would a site reset if the player got chased off, like a FW Plex eventually does? Also, LP and the anom systems are kind of weird bedmates. If it's just Concord LP, there isn't really that much Concord stuff to buy, and empire faction LP probably makes sense to keep as a high/low incentive.
---
You can drop the price low enough that you get no royalty (it will also reduce the overall price)
---
So if you slap them up there at $8 or something, everyone can just buy it directly from amazon, you get no profit and no taxes, and everyone gets the product super fast with no difficulty.
---
If you use entosis module on the wreck of Solitaire in  Ienakkamon you can get a "navigation telemetry" item.
---
&gt;This recovered data stream is incomplete but appears to be part of a navigation telemetry dataset. Perhaps something can be made of it with a bit of ingenuity.
---
&gt;...#=!!!EF///S0.1//0.3//0.2//0.4//0.4//0.6//R0.7//0.7//0.5//0.6//0.6//0.8//0.9//R0.7//0.7//0.8//R0.5//0.6//0.9//1.0//R0.9//0.6//0.7//R0.7//0.7//0.7//D0.7///D-RE!!!=#...
---
This is the route that the ship took. It doesn't look like much but it is enough to trace the route of that ship. ([Project discovery treasure hunt](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Project_Discovery_treasure_hunt))
---
It would be pretty cool if player ship wrecks could be scanned too and this kind of navigation telemetry could be obtained.
---
Not gonna comment on horde's JFing methods aside that I haul for horde (not a secret).
---
Regarding those services' pricing, I mean they are putting their time into the game - they are going to charge what they feel is fair for their time. If you don't want to pay it, you don't have to. Open up a different service and charge less, you'd get customers. But if you've done hauling and logistics for well over a decade as you say, you know it's already tedious and lackluster. My biggest gripe is that this change just makes it even more tedious without any positive return to the player. It's just a completely negative change.
---
you cant really do live in null and high sec at the same time.   Well you can but it is a pain the rear.  I still go to high sec and run missions for a change of pace.      But that takes my toon out of null sec for a day or two.
---
Give it to me for 26 billion  I'll sell it and gain 1 extra billion for myself
---
A proof
---
I dont think those words mean what you think they mean you dirty little shit gibbon
---
&gt;There's a lot of factors players are not logging
---
I've been wondering if the political and economic RL craziness thats been going on lately might be having an effect. Not to mention that every summer player count dips.
---
I'm looking forward to seeing what the fall/winter numbers look like as well as seeing if hilmar is right and the game has an upswing in activity when the next recession hits.
---
Honestly the memorial cyno things have been generally respected by most parties in the game. Lighting a cyno on any ship for the memorial won’t really matter. I can see how some people might be effected by it but most groups/FCs/VIPs sort of know each other and would probably catch onto what’s going on and probably leave it alone. I know as a hunter and a pvper I would. I mean a killmail is a killmail but I’m usually not a dick about it. I drop my son on ventures but I usually send that nerd 10mil and tell him what he should do next time. Haha
---
&gt;Another part of the drop is the banned bot accounts that number in the thousands each month
---
Which would also apply to the "old" numbers that are used in the comparison.
---
&gt;(they have to move to hisec, sell their null ratting ships, buy hisec mining ships, roll new alts, etc).
---
Why would they bother to sell their null ratting ships first?  They don't need to actually sell those in order to move.
---
Just pod the bot character back to highsec, give it a T1 industrial and start botting distribution missions.  Selling the old ships is a plus, but nowhere near as important as starting the cash flow again.
---
&gt;Tbh i'd rather have botting ventures and haulers mining and running courrier missions in hisec, than botting supers in null.
---
Because unkillable bots is much better than killable-but-require-effort bots.
---
&gt;Some are students and kids starting school, grown-ups dealing with their kids doing that, or simply adults busy setting up and making plans for their new "business season" after the summer holidays.
---
&gt;And finally, part of it is people like me who play casually and mostly solo, plexing one or two months at a time because there's not really a lot of interesting stuff happening and there hasn't been for years
---
&gt;The PCU numbers show us how many characters (not people) are online.
---
CCP gets paid based on characters, not people.  Targets in space are characters, not people.  A carrier ratter switching to abyssals mean you don't have a ship in space that you can tackle anymore.
---
&gt;The PCU tells us nothing about the contribution of each aforementioned demographic/group (and the myriad other groups not logging in) in the numbers of those not logging in. 
---
Yet those same demographics did apply to the numbers a year ago.
---
And with the lower ISK/hr, you need *more* bot characters, not fewer.
---
We can make inferences from the years of data that CCP has supplied.  There is not magic "CCP only" data that could show everything is wonderful.
---
This is a very valid point.
---
But 82 is always bigger than 1, so your argument is invalid.
---
In these kind of games there is always an advantage of having more account.
---
Not sure what the problem is. Regular T1 Indies can be fit to be incredibly fast for like 3mil isk, and if you absolutely don't want it to die en route, use a blockade runner instead? The only thing I can think of is making the indy cyno expire much faster, like a covert.
---
RMT isn't allowed don't do that!
---
CCP gets paid based on PCU.
---
Targets in space for you to attack is based on PCU.
---
Sure you do.
---
Totally agreed.
---
Perhaps 50+ man fleets aren't that big for megacoalitions but there are many groups that can't form those types of numbers to kill rorquals, and these changes practically remove carrier ratting completely leaving absolutely nothing to do outside of timezone tanked timers.
---
You should skill urself.
---
In the song "How to Stay Aligned" the chorus mention something about "Planet 6" Is it a kind of old meme ?
---
Fair enough, and I don't mean to offend. The poem is overdone on reddit (hence the meme). Cyno memorials I have nothing but respect for.
---
The MER suggested that isk value lost in nullsec stayed pretty stable over that time period, even as the bounty payouts plummeted.
---
I haven't seen data on actual numbers destroyed.
---
Holy shit man that’s one hell of a Protip, thanks. Also I guess to piggy back this. I dove into a WH for exploration yesterday and had some RATs at a site. What ship(I’m amarr/caldari) would you recommend to start taking these on or what DPs/ego should I be around so that I don’t just have to instantly warp out anymore.
---
In space no one can hear you cry.
---
Every jf I know didn't bitch about the covert cynos, pretty much all of the, said it was a buff and started to train alts in the covert cynos for the change. The people that complained were people that wanted easy cyno ship kills and having jfs jumping to coverts would make their life harder to get those kills.
---
Isn't there also an Eve-hr.com or something?
---
Okay, so not super fantastical.
---
Obviously, that's great for how brain dead super ratting can be, and how scalable it is.
---
But really active pilots can earn that much in multiple places.
---
I do.
---
It's not too difficult.
---
2 hours can easily make 700,000+ LP that can convert with minimal effort at 1k isk/lp
---
Some risk, as I have lost ships doing this, but that was mainly because I deliberately made risky decisions instead of just playing it safe.
---
&gt; change just makes it even more tedious without any positive return to the player.
---
On this we definitely agree.  CCP said they didn't want to impact JF logistics, then they gave us covert cynos - with the cost of super high SP requirements for cyno alts + much, much, much more expensive lossmails.   The added bonus was JF logistics into jammed systems suddenly became easy.  
---
Then they gave us JF cynos on industrial hulls.  They're easy to build in location (where services are available, granted), but they're also 20k m3, in a JF where space is typically at a premium.  
---
I absolutely agree the changes suck, but this one sucks way less than blowing tens of billions on stockpiling prospects and rapiers everywhere in NPC null and low-sec, plus injecting cyno chars into T2 hulls as well. 
---
The only advantage this change has given "us" is that it has opened up a bit of a market/production metagame/side business for selling cheap and easy T1 hulls for profits.  A marginal advantage is that at least blops can use these cynos, too, meaning the possibilities for traps remains in play due to blops drop/bridge.
---
Wormholers roll then undock and warp their fleet in. It’s a different style of PvP
---
wreathe can be made sub 2 second align, so in lowsec they are almost immune to getting caught at gates at least.
---
Wow all the krabs aren’t logging in their 4 rorquals and 3 myrms, who would’ve thought we’d have a mild decrease in online characters
---
Get rid of systems. Less systems = more conflict.
---
I dont recall exactly but it was something like that. I took data from a couple of market tools
---
This guy gets it.
---
There's many of us who want more people in space, not less, which I can tell you is happening. More people = more kills. ffs, use your brain.
---
Unban stunt flores
---
Im not saying ageis sov is good, but i do think it is way better than fucking SBU fights where the biggest supercap dick just wipes the field regardless of anything else. Entosis fights are a lot of fun now, at least when youre fighting a reasonably equal opponent at a reasonable timezone. The current sov war chain of events: where you have to disrupt ratting before you can hit ihubs before you can reasonably attack citadels. Pretty fun.
---
For citadels, Damage caps are not the problem, its the timer mechanics. And maybe also the spam. Being able to anchor structures anywhere is both interesting and cancerous. Im not sure which is better.
---
Station games were dumb, I dont miss that shit at all. The current tether mechanics are better than both station games and forcefields
---
Entosising station services, while cool, doesnt really produce meaningfull gameplay when citadel guns exist. RFing jump bridges and cynojammers serves a similar gameplay role, and i hope they expand this class of structures to handle more services so they can be harassed.
---
Except no they don’t 
---
They get paid in how much real life money people give them
---
turns out pvpers who don’t krab all day end up buying plex more than people with 6 rorqs that just mine 24/7 and go on a start pap once a month
---
&gt;or move higher tier filaments into nullsec only
---
Running a filament on-grid with your staging Keepstar isn't exactly dangerous.
---
&gt;Stuff that you can't just bot in a myrmidon.
---
Everything in Eve can be botted.  Frankly, everything PVE in every game can be botted.
---
Think of it this way, when you run an abyssal, you're using an algorithm.  Sure, you make decisions based on what appears in the pocket, but you will pretty much always be walking through the same decision tree.  "This one has lots of neuts, so I'm gonna &lt;insert behavior here&gt;"
---
That decision tree isn't at all hard to program.
---
Your assuming that risky, target rich nullsec is impossible. I dont agree.
---
They should just make is usable on the venture/prospect/endurance as well tbh
---
I was just going to say don't waste real money subscribing. The game is terrible. But maybe you could give w-space a try. It's the only playstyle CCP didn't just take a massive shit on?
---
I never assumed anything i just stated facts that 10 accounts be it creditcard, paypal or plexed is still money to ccp bank account. also fact is the plexed accounts makes ccp more money then credit or paypal accounts
---
Honestly, I only have one standard character and this is the first time I've played at the start of a new league and I'm loving it. Sadly, I couldnt no-life the weekend like I was hoping but still its a fun time.
---
I wasn't aware of the items in the new League may not make into Standard when it's over.
---
Neither super ratting or abyssals are scalable from an individual perspective. They require too much apm and attention to multibox. True, active pilots could always do other things, but i think these are some of the most accessible to your average nullsec line member
---
I don't see how this can possibly work. Not trying to sound super negative, but Eve is a game that is very niche to begin with and has problems getting new players to keep playing. The NPE has been iterated on so many times but it is still a reoccurring theme. Making a change that is basically pushing a lot of the older/more established players to unsub accounts/quit and expecting new players or returning players to take up the slack just doesn't seem to make much sense.
---
WHY ARE GOONS THE ONLY SCHMUCKS COMPLAINING ABOUT THE BLACKOUT? THEY SHOULD JUST DISMANTLE THEIR LAZY CAREBEAR ALLIANCE AND LEAVE. MAKE ROOM FOR PLAYERS WHO DON'T MIND HAVING A LITTLE RISK VS REWARD.
---
gross
---
dude fuck off
---
you want to be a bitter vet that doesn't play? fine. but don't fucking come in here and _actively encourage people to not play_. that's real shitty of you.
---
although considering this is spaghetti code a la Eve, it is probably now impossible to change..
---
Given that there's a huge CCP push for bot-hunting at the same time as the blackout, it's pretty hard to disentangle the numbers for one from the other. As /u/Jestertrek/ pointed out elsewhere in this thread, two-thirds of the drop in accounts seems to be centered in the AU/CN timezone: the exact result you'd expect to see if botters were being targeted and having their accounts banned en masse.
---
I have two big questions: first, are the numbers of *actual* players even dropping (and honestly, I don't believe we don't have the raw data to make anything but educated guesses on this); and second, why would removing the blackout fix this?
---
&gt;A single guy that will be able to move in a ship with cover cyno can negate this aspect of gatecamping as he can bring more ships at any point.
---
Having more ships on the other end of a cyno means nothing if you are losing targets because you are being slowed down.
---
&gt;Gates are not camped 23/7 so moving alt at some strange TZ or bringing a gang to seed a covert cyno alt is a thing you can do.
---
Right, which means the threat from anything that isn't a cloaky camper is reduced.
---
&gt; that staying in highsec is boring
---
not as boring as in nullsec. with friendly courtesy of the krabsky playerbase.
---
Unironically
---
You have nothing else to do with your time?
---
As I always say, there are two kinds of players in Eve. Asset acquirers and activity-based players. The former consist of people who play to own ships, grow their wealth, grow their corps/alliances, and so on. The latter consists of people who play to kill ships, to PvP, whale, or even people who actually enjoy PvE for the sake of it. Nothing wrong with either group.
---
But with Rorquals, injectors et al. Eve selected against activity based players. Alliance by alliance, corp by corp, the activity based groups dissolved, players left, playstyles became insignificant, or had to adapt to asset acquisition gameplay. 
---
The more this happened, the more a gap we have seen between production and destruction, isk faucets and isk sinks. ISK and minerals kept being spammed into the game. And weren't removed at the same pace.
---
The ISK spam caused an unsustainable inflation. The game constantly reducing the value of ISK is bad, so CCP seem to historically care about ISK spam. But I actually care equally about the mineral spam. The mineral spam caused people to proliferate and accumulate too much stuff. But the stuff they accumulate -capitals and citadels- isn't friendly to everyday fights, daily warfare, daily destruction. So destruction wasn't increasing proportionally with production, and the same with sinks with faucets. The spam was unsustainable and something had to be done to cut it.
---
As a response, space was made more dangerous. But after 5 years of selectivity toward asset acquirers, it was only natural that many of them chose to leave the game until better conditions (or forever). On an alliance level, they even halted wars and further blued up each other. 
---
In this situation, how can CCP cut the spam while keeping the amount of players engaging with Eve intact? To answer your question; no, I don't think I heard a reasonable proposal to cut the spam while keeping the playerbase intact. There are a lot of people whose main activity is farming in null. But no nullseccer will give you an answer on how we are supposed to cut ISK and mineral faucets yet not experience a drastic reduction on PCU.
---
There are workable ideas here and there to increase sinks. But I bet other measures to reduce faucets, such as gimping bounties to something like their 1/3 value, would have a similar effect to Blackout. The new risk/reward deal wouldn't be lucrative to many.
---
How about the mineral spam? How will Eve foster destruction again? I think the game chose players of the acquirer mentality over and over again that it is now incredibly hard to make them fight. Moreover, player coalitions and blocs form not with PvP (invasions, offense, destruction) in mind; but with acquisition (defense, umbrellas) in mind. This is why you see a huge unevenness of power between different blocs, which will keep the stagnant status quo. The unevenness will ensure that nobody will attack Goons. And anybody who get attack by them will just give up and get glassed.
---
It's -the- most important problem in Eve. And no I haven't heard an elaborate proposal to fix it. People just want to shortsightedly go back to the less riskier higher faucet status quo. But the actual thing asset acquirers don't realize is that these days it takes about 2-5 years to own everything you want in this game; and then the asset acquisition game expires. So even they should actually push for a game which they have things to do with the titans, instead of merely owning them.
---
Holy shit almost 10 years, time to speed run this.
---
&gt; and 20 boxers (an "almost as good" thing) as anything else.
---
Those 20-boxers are 20 subs or PLEX.  That's a big loss for CCP's income.
---
It's also 20 fewer targets in space for hunters.
---
&gt;If they see those numbers going south in a serious way, they're going to react, unless their earn-outs with their new overlords don't mean anything to them, which I doubt.
---
You're assuming they have any idea how to react.
---
The fact that they've started "ChAoS ErA" kinda indicates they don't.  If they did, they'd have a plan instead of throwing out stuff and labeling it "Chaos".
---
Personally, I see more and more of SOE trying to "save" Star Wars Galaxies in CCP's recent actions.  Both are dealing with pressure from above to get numbers up, both appear to be throwing out changes for change's sake in the hope that they stumble across something that will help.
---
That's what I do while waiting for a task to come up for work :) In summer the work is slow
---
The game is dead without new players. You cant just rely on a constant old-guard of multiboxing whales to sustain and grow your game in the long term. 
---
There is still plenty of motivation to multibox, some would argue even more now. 
---
The problem is both the NPE, and rewarding gameplay for new players, without massive initial investment. 
---
When new players get into the game, they see massive multiboxing and skill injecting alts to be the only viable method of competing, they just walk away. Providing meaningfull, rewarding, and acessible content, both PVE and PVP, for single accounts and smaller groups in neccisary for the longevity and overall growth and sucess of the game.
---
There was a massive surge of players when eve went F2P, but none of them stuck around because they saw little benefit from subscribing only 1 account.
---
Agreed. They could have easily solved this by implementing a memorial cyno (which as I said in the main post, they could have maid special - skies the limit with creativity). That cyno could be fit to any ship, nothing could jump to it. That would make that issue non-existent, and not completely disrupt a huge part of the game and content driver for everything non-highsec.
---
I passed math though I failed calculus 2 I have to retake that in some year
---
Meh. Ive never put much stock into killboards at all. Ive been killed by folks with 1 kill 3 years ago and 50 losses since, and also killed folks who have 50 times my destroyed value and havent lost a ship in 6 months. They don't mean much
---

Except these numbers aren't going up.
---
Lol are you mad. Have you witnessed the power of the goonswarm. Alone even without the rest the imperium there is no single group that could match them. Maybe test could.. But that fight will never happen.
---
Goons is the strongest alliance in eve, the envy of every other alliance in the game.
---
Who would have thought that making the game unfriendly to players 'playing their way' (as CCP commercials promise you can) would drive them away. Who could have possibly foreseen that?!?
---
When the autists get their way, they get their way. REEEEEEing even harder after the consequences are, predictably, coming to fruition.
---
"Why no more targets guys? Guys? Why no more targets? HERRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPP!!!!!"
---
Oh fuck off. Eve players use their initiative all the time for creating actual content. Most of us have to budget time/effort between "chores needed to make content happen" and "actual content that's the reason we play this game." Making us do more chores for no reason makes the cancer:content ratio worse. This part of the change doesn't contribute to fun/content in any way, it's just a time sink people will need to pour some more of their life down in order to keep playing the game they actually want to play.

I know, was just trying to answer the question about how $20 magically and mysteriously equals 27 bil ISK. I get my ISK in Eve the right way, by theft.

Also, those PvPers want a certain exchange rate between ISK and real-life money.  If they don't get enough ISK, they're not buying plex.

Check our /r/evejobs or the eve online recruitment forums and find a group that interests you. Any competent group will explain all the best ways to make isk now.

You eve guys always have to focus on the flaws, focus on the merits pls

Simply put, you don't fit the normal players I have in mind, you're more dedicated. Now pls don't reply back thanks!

I like the dscan range thing. But I counter with another more role focused idea.

Combat cepters all get:
---
+5 pg 
---
+30 cpu
---
Role bonus:
---
Warp scrambles used o  this ship do not turn off MWD
---
Allows them to be able to fit a little tank (for a cepter) and maybe alittle bigger then the smallest guns. Also bringing them in like with the perfect anti cepter/screen ship without giving them the AC like the ram jags that everyone loves
---
Bro, it's chaos. There's no listening, just wormhole for everyone
---
There was always risk. (well except for bots)
---
Yup, my face too when hearing what the GSM has to say about anything
---
tbh, while i understand that getting nerfed might make you angry, its hard to sympathize with you:
---
you seem to have totally lost perspective on just how massively powerful and useful JF's as compared to the alternatives.
---
as a new player to eve, the things i had to do when i moved out of a null region make your complaints seem trivial. i did a lot of planning and scouting to try and minimize my risks, i had to make huge tradeoffs between volume and safety, and had several moments when i was at risk of losing months of work etc due to the nature of normal Eve-space travel in NS/LS. meanwhile, you undock, click 'jump to' a couple of times and are able to skip pretty much all of that, the risk &amp; preparation and scouting etc, while also moving huge volumes of stuff to and fro.

Nah this was me talking actually lol

If you go in the launcher settings you can tell it to download everything. The settings icon is on the lower left hand corner by the blue bar.
---
New players have basically zero exposure to multi boxing or skill injecting in the first couple hours/days/maybe even months or playing the game, so to blame that for the lack of new player retention, when it has been an issue since before the game even had skill injecting, is just idiotic and looking for some sort of scapegoat to a problem that has existed forever.

I think interceptors should not be nullified, but all other current nully ships are cool by me.

Thank you for posting this. Well written, reasonable, positive.
---
Beyond 2-3 mids, you are stocking a large amount of reship indies which takes up the cargo space you need to haul items to wherever you are going. This is going to make JFing more trouble than it's worth, thus making deployments / anything non-established more trouble than it's worth. That means less content. Not good for the game.

God bless dude, if it gets them to not do it mission accomplished indeed. That poem is the cringiest shit in the universe. If I die and I’m memorialized by a crappy copy/paste poem I’d probably kill myself again
---
Instead, look at another class of ships that have split bonuses: Recon  
---
Now that the Force Recon ships are suddenly 'buffed' with the ability to light regular cyno's, perhaps we should revisit the Combat Recons unique bonus, and apply them to Combat Interceptors as well...
---
Net result is still a very slippery scouting hull, that only truly shines if the Stargate/Wormhole/other entry point is completely unguarded.

Once you figure out your main goal in Eve...everything else flows from that.  Right now, you don't have a goal.

"Dabbling here, trading there, flying a frigate, etc..." isn't the way to really play.

How about "Dangerous Industry really intrigues me....My goal is to set up backwater ship building and extracting that product to mid-major markets via wormhole travel"

just put t1 warp disruptor on an ibis and suicide it into the freighter to get another 3 minutes

You're looking at it in a narrow minded way. Zkill also gives you info about their fits, whether they rather solo or gang fight, their most used ships and most importantly at which time of the day do they use what kind of ships or are generally active.

Checking zKill doesn't just entail checking for green or red colors in the frontpage tbh

you realise that this HTFU elite peeveepee mentality would drive out everyone who didn't want to pvp in highsec? In a grand picture, there is a risk reward that is pretty constant. Worm hole space is medium high risk and extremely high reward, for example, the majority of the time.
---
Nobody will play in highsec if you do this: nobody who plays casually will undock: and bots will move most probably move to wormhole space. The player count will burn and crash once you take into account that people who play in highsec don't really want to play in nullsec.
---
Why do people stay in nullsec despite the risk? It's profitable. Given that, why would you stay in highsec given that it'd become a peeveepee battle royale with no reward to offer for those who want to stay.

The CSM is doing their best to convince CCP.

Hypothetically, if you wanted to make jump freighter logistics less efficient and more dangerous, what low effort change(s) would you go with?
---
SOMETHING SOMETHING YOUR MOM'S SPAHGETTI IS A UCRAINIAN WHORE
---
There's really not much to spin here tbh. I'm also not a goon and never have been associated with them or any of the big blocks except for a couple month stint in PL a while ago.
---
These changes were just bad and had little thought put into them except to please the vocal redditors.
---
So there's a couple issues at play that always get conflated together.
---
The first is "isk faucet" which is the inflationary pressure from raw isk being dumped into the economy through ratting, and people usually point to [graphs like this](https://webimg.ccpgamescdn.com/7lhcm73ukv5p/4aEmnvffst3ilL9hSHTaK7/4fd848a14dd2f0b4591eeb3dcbb71a7c/9a_sinksfaucets.png) to support the statement that Sov Null is too large of an isk faucet, which is a pretty valid statement.
---
The way to address faucets is to either reduce the raw isk somehow, or increase sinks. The method I proposed, having anoms give LP in some way (probably CONCORD as CONCORD LP is "neutral", convertable into faction LP, and the source of capital mods that null loves so much), would hit this on two fronts by reducing both the isk faucet and adding in an isk sink. The ratio of bounties to LP is also an adjustable one that would let CCP tweak the isk faucet at will without impacting rewards if they so wished.
---
The next is "rewards", which is combined everything from null PVE, including bounties, salvage, meta mods, deadspace loot from escalations, etc. If the reward is too high, CCP can either increase the risk to make it more in line, or reduce the reward to make it in line with risk. This is a separate knob that CCP can tweak independent of "faucet". But CCP being CCP, in it's zeal to rein in the null isk faucet gutted null rewards without providing an alternative.
---
&gt; (2) I like the idea of getting something for finishing a site, but also recognize that bots have infinite patience - would a site reset if the player got chased off, like a FW Plex eventually does? Also, LP and the anom systems are kind of weird bedmates. If it's just Concord LP, there isn't really that much Concord stuff to buy, and empire faction LP probably makes sense to keep as a high/low incentive.
---
CCP actually had a nice idea about this with the ESS, but they implemented it horribly. The ESS would drop bounties in a system by 25%, then store that bounty plus a bonus in the ESS itself that would increase as more bounties got collected. Ratters can go to the ESS and cash out, causing the isk to be distributed, or a roaming ganker can go to the ESS and take all the isk in the form of tags. The idea is that the increasing bounty over time would encourage ratters to not cash out and wait for the bonus, but would also provide gankers with a fat payout if they stole the tags. The ESS also generated a warp disruption field so theoretically you had to stay on field to collect bounties and fight whoever that came.
---
However the implementation was horrible. Anyone could put down and ESS and there was drama over people who didn't like the ESS and would shoot them. Then there was drama over people who would empty the ESS when they finished ratting and reset everyone else's bonuses. Then there was the matter that the ESS cashed out too quickly to allow ratters to reship into a PVP ship. Then there was ratters putting the ESS in a forlorn hub and shooting the triggers to spawn 40+ rats that would make quick work of anyone trying cash out unless they cleared the site in a carrier first. Then there was the fact that CCP announced that the ESS patch would reduce rat bounties by 5% so unless you used the ESS you got a nerf. In the end most alliances banned ESS because it wasn't worth the drama.
---
However, that doesn't mean the idea doesn't have merit. A couple tweaks can make the ESS actually decent. Make the bounty deduction "opt in" such that you could warp to it and agree whether you want the deduction. Make the cash out "personal" such that other people in your alliance can't cash you out and break your bonus. Make the payout LP rather than isk to reduce the isk faucet. Make it take longer to cash out, and also make the warp disruption field larger but only activate when cashing out to make the module less of a pain to interact with and harder to disengage from.

Sunday is the important day.

Sweet.

WHATS NERFED IS YOUR CAPSLOCK, FAGGOT
---
Dude come play eve with me. It's not dying and we're recruiting! Had a ton of fun this weekend too
---
Not all players. A lot of us handle this game as it is:  just a game, which serves to have fun, we use it to talk and keep in touch with others. And most of us are not game designers, a company's CEO responsible for a lot of other people's work, investors, stake holders and so on. So most of us are just players, we are angry about real life problems, and not about a game. Even if it is a more or less a hobby for us, and we are worry about it's state. But we are adults, we can find other hobby, we can move on. So eve is important for us but we can handle the game in it's own place.  
---
You are angry, and a some people also. But it doesn't mean everybody.
---
Uh, nah dude I'm not wrong. The ship class had a unique function regardless of how tough AF were, nullification was the nail in the coffin so maybe you "try again".

---
Kinda curious how far along the game you are, or how involved you are in anything beyond joining fleet and F1-ing. Do you know where all your ships come from? Do you know where all the materials used to build the ships come from?
---
Have you ever used a freighter / jump freighter? Have you ever seeded for a deployment?
---
If you don't, you have no clue about this issue.
---
only those of us with 9* spare accounts can now hold freighters indefinitely , thanks CCP
---
Lets take them a step further and give them 200% to scramble range. Now they are mandatory lol.
---
I didn't have a problem with the covert cyno idea. What's hilarious about where we've ended up is that the nullbears cried so hard about the cyno changes, and concern trolled about JF logistics, that they've ended up pushing CCP into something which inconveniences them even more.
---
On a wider note, though, JF logistics are way too easy pre-change. You can move things across the entire cluster in a short time with almost no risk, and the cost is minimal. They did need to do something, even if it wasn't this.
---
I fully look forward to the amount of people that will take this post seriously.
---
indeed it does but WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS LOWERCASE BULLSHIT
---
Have them put in both - the covert cyno / indy cyno. One's safer, but more tedious and annoying to set up. The other is more expensive, higher skill requirements, but lets you do more with the JF (cyno in / safe log) in systems where there aren't any stations or citadels. That's a HUGE gamble depending on how much you are putting on field.
---
Additionally, the covert cyno ship itself would be worth 30x the cost of a t1 indy cyno. Risk = convenience. Less risk = safety/tedium.
---
blops bs can still jump to indy cyno. Maybe even bridge to them?
---

It will remain so while supercapitals remain an unanswerable counter to any subcap doctrine with less grid mobility and ability to disengage.
---
You can have Titan and supercapitals in anything close to their current form, or you can have Stuka-style doctrines but not both.
---
I agree it's a sad state of affairs, but here we are.
---
Yes but the numbers suggested here also remind me of another law. Maybe I'm not using the wrong numbers just the wrong law?
---
Blackout is not the reason are finally throwing their arms up and walking away from this game..
---
Not players, characters.
---
Fewer characters is not a bad thing (as long as CCP's finances are okay with it) if those characters were (i) bots or (ii) multiboxing nullsec ratters who would dock up as soon as something hit local anyway. Those characters are not adding anything to the game experience and are devaluing everybody else's ISK.
---
If people have to actively play the game then they'll be having more fun than distractedly managing 5 multiboxing accounts, but that will show up as -4 in your stats.
---
HEY GOOD FOR YOU YOU ACTUALLY FUCKING TRIED AND SHIT.
---
MOST OF THESE FUCKS WOULD RATHER JUST WALLOW IN SELF PITY THAN DO ANYTHING PROACTIVE TO CHANGE THIER SITUATION OR OUTLOOK ON LIFE, AND THEN PROJECT THAT ONTO AN INTERNET SPACESHIP VIDEOGAME FORUM.

Maybe you should stop taking drugs at the same time, Meth and Math don't mix well

First bump, second bump, third bump then hug it, warp the fleet and dunk it.

Join a newbie friendly big alliance (horde, karma, brave, etc), meet people and get involved.  I come and go as well, it really helps you to get re-acclimated to the game.
---
&gt; When new players get into the game, they see massive multiboxing and skill injecting alts to be the only viable method of competing, they just walk away
---
That feels like a straw man to me, that isn't part of the new player experience in game, and it would be a pretty bad alliance that gave them that impression.
---
But if all your guides are about working towards multiboxed VNI farming then that just goes to show that CCP is right to make that harder.
---
&gt; Providing meaningfull, rewarding, and acessible content, both PVE and PVP, for single accounts and smaller groups in neccisary
---
Like abyssal sites, incursions, high level missions, wormhole PVE, DED sites, small gang PVP (without cyno threats) and so on?
---
No problem, it’s always nice to help fellow explorers :)
---
What you met in your wormhole is called a Sleeper site. I don’t know if you know much about them, and I’ll guess you don’t because I love to explain stuff &gt;.&lt;
---
Basically, in every wormhole you can find exploration sites (the one with the data or relic icon once scanned down to at least 25%) that are defended by Sleeper rats. Those rats are not your regular enemies, as they boast high EHP and DPS for their size, alongside an advanced AI (I can develop on that if you want) and very, very effective EWAR (the kind that can completely dry out a battleship’s capacitor). In some sites, those sleepers will even use warp scramblers, which mean you’ll be stuck with them until you die (which happens quickly in a scanning ship).
---
There’s a very easy way to know if the site you’re warping to will be defended : once you have it scanned it down, check its name. If it contain "Unsecured" for Data signatures, or "Forgotten" for Relic signatures, there’ll be defenders ! Also, please note that those sites are ran for the loot in each sleeper rat rather than for the cans themselves, and they generally contain very bad loot if you’re not into Tech III ships Invention.
---
Concerning a ship, you can use your regular scanning ship for the cans ONCE EVERY RAT IS DEAD. In fact, I’m not even sure you can enter the hacking mini game if there are still some defenders around. Which mean that if you want to clear it, you’ll have to bring a ratting ship.
---
Which one depends on the "class" of the wormhole you’re in. Lower classes means easier, but less rewarding, sites. Here’s a nice list from my own experience :
---
C1-C2 : T1 Battlecruiser for the former and with very good skills and ship handling for the latter. Personally, I use a Gila to run both classes and it works fine.
---
C3 : People tend to use faction battleships with specialized fits at this level, or the Society of Conscious Thoughts’ battleship "Praxis". For a solo player, the Guristas’ Rattlesnake reigns king here, thanks to its massive tank and DPS.
---
C4 : Generally not worth running, as they offer very little reward compared to C3 sites, but the difficulty is way higher. A smaller battleship fleet (two, maybe three ?) using remote repairing modules should handle those sites, but at this level your better off in an higher tier.
---
C5 : The bread and butter of wormhole ISK making. At this level, the sites are extremely hard, so you either need a bigger RR battleship fleet with tanking system effects (some wormholes have special system-wide effect improving some of your ship’s stats at the loss of others), or a Dreadnought-class Capital ship. According to many, this is where you’ll get the best ISK/h in the game.
---
C6 : Top tier of the wormhole classes, a lot of people have long argued if C6 combat sites are really that better over C5 ones. Yes, they have the biggest ISK rewards, but they are also considerably harder and longer to finish. I suppose a Dreadnought with a blingy fit could also work here, but I’m not sure.
---
There you go :)
---
PS : i just noticed you said you were Amarr/Caldari &gt;.&lt;
---
Amarr is not so good starting from C2 sites, as powering your guns and your tank under Sleeper’s energy neutralization will be a pain in the ass. For a long time there has been a lot of meme around the Caldari Drake Battlecruiser, but it’s an effective and cheap option for wormhole sites, and finishing a single one is generally enough to afford another Drake and its fit if you were to lose it. And be sure it’s going to happen, wormhole space is a scary place for ratters !
---
Right? The cov ops cyno would have been a great addition. So you now had to train cyno 5 for a huge buff in mobility but that was too hard for people. Now we get this stupid shit instead.
---
Just curious, does CCP pay for this or if your on CSM you pay out of pocket? Or do they only select local players to avoid this?
---
Correct, but also a good solution. Chain of keepstars up through LS to the high sec border. Brick tanked widow + fax undocks, cyno up. Shoot through a chunk of freighters carrying 3x the load. Get to the end of the road - swap down to bulkhead freighters that carry less, but on neutral alts are more likely to survive and ship in and out.
---
This isn't about "hoping for people to leave the game", but people whose investment was so low that they leave the game because they can't bear to play without local chat aren't really the kind of players game design should be centred around.
---
Abyssals aren't sure.
---
I think super ratting would mostly be. Sure, you'd have reduced ticks, but you'd have more out. So not perfectly scalable, but to a larger degree than things like DED sites, but maybe less so than missions. and much less so than mining.
---
I believe the answer is yes. I'm not 100 %, but many times I have started my client and closed it while patching. It starts at 0/XYZ but it speeds through that. Worst case scenario, open launcher and minimize it to get it out of the way.
---
C.  Let subs lapse as there is little to do anymore.  It takes even longer to hunt targets now as ratting has cratered.  Fuck it, watch it burn.
---
The margins on ships and stuff would go up and more people would use their industrial slots.
---
&gt; Ratting players also help you by spending isk to buy plex
---
Lol what? All that does is makes PLEX more expensive for me.
---
he's still right
---
Nope, they can't. Just min-maxxed it myself
---
&gt; Evasion allows smaller groups/ lower alt count since you are protected by game mechanics
---

---

---
An hour to go 20+ jumps... wtf are you flying? A brick?
---
Ever watch battlestar galactica where they use jump drives to jump directly to a point in space very far away? 
---
Some ships in eve have such a drive, but they need a beacon to jump to. The cyno is that beacon.
---
It comes in several flavors, original, covert, and now Industrial. 
---
Original cyno is usable by any jump drive capable ship, and is the only one most can use. It has the drawback of showing up on the map for anyone to see and alerting all of new eden that something is happening. They are also warpable from overview in system.
---
It used to be any ship could be used as a cyno ship, so they were pretty much just throwaway rags. The big change is limiting severely which ships can fit them.
---
Covert cynos are only usable by covert ops ships and jumpable by blacck ops battleships. These do not show on the map and are not warpable from overview.
---
The new industrial cynos are fit by industrial ships, which are nearly throwaway cheap, but don't travel well. I mean, I have used T1 haulers like the nereus to bring stuff out to null, within null, etc....but its apparently far too dangerous to use....even though they cost like nothing.
---
But now it's actually meaningful risk, as opposed to the kind of risk that requires the target to make huge mistakes.
---
At a top down level, having been in numerous titan fights, I really cannot say it would be a good idea to give titans or supers any more EHP. We are at a point where it takes 50 to 60 DDs fired in broadside volley to kill an enemy titan, depending on if they add a mixed tank, and you have rainbow damage or mostly two damage types that the enemy is tanking against. A better direction to go would be something that was an aoe burst that gave the fleet +cap / + cap regen / +sensor strength / +tracking or application vs. capitals. A much more dangerous idea, but perhaps worthwhile would be a high slot that was on a 10 minute cool down that gave a 12-18 second EHE type boost to a single targetted ship. Allowing a pair of flag ships to EHE each other since they cannot DD.
---
you can put the bpos in one hangar where people only have view access. 
---
then just route the outputs of the copy job into another one where people have take access
---
I posted this before, but I think it would be cool to give them a bit more speed, a bit more warp speed, reduced signature (or mwd bloom reduction) and maybe scram invulnerable.
---
Take away any damage bonuses, and add application bonuses.  
---
Basically make them anti-tackle/anti-fighter/anti-drone, and also able to respond quickly.
---
The role would be if something big gets tackled, they could haul ass to it, and try to untackle it.
---
How do you think anything is created in the first place? Stuff costs money son, if you don release a working project then you have.... yes, wasted money.
---
In the launcher you can download everything.
---
But the download as you play thing is better. It only downloads things as you "use" them.
---
So if you never go to Cloud ring, you won't download the Cloud Ring skyboxes.
---
If you never see a proteus (cause it's cloaked) you'll never download the proteus models and textures.
---
Eve HR is a great tool
---
I don't really think that 'I can't fund shiny PVP with zero-effort ISK printing PVE' is bad for the game tbh.
---
Hillmar looks lost. We should help him.
---
Mine takes like 3 minutes to download the basics+ stuff my accounts signal to it to download and get it all installed.
---
I have to install the game at pc cafes regularly.
---
I disagree with O.P. and this whole post on the grounds that logistics is not the most boring part of the game. Not even close. That honor goes to mining.
---
On a side note, get back to the basics, instead of relying on an army of alts, rely on your Corp /alliance mates. That also takes care of large chunk of the boredom due to the fact that fucking around on VoIP becomes much higher quality.
---
It is indicating that it has 181 things it needs to install.
---
It does downloading and then installing.
---
So it will think it needs to install 181 things, then as it hits ones it has already downloaded, it'll skip through them and then install everything in a batch at the end.
---
ah maybe its changed then, or im imagining things.
---

---
Provi has been absolutely decimated by these changes. They have decent density but no umbrella to provide cover. Any tackled subcap is dead 90% of the time and bombers can land tackle easily without local. They can't upship to something that can tank bombers because TEST/GOONS/Horde have more caps in a single sig than Provi has combined.
---
In June Provi ratted 830B, in August they are at 71. Whereas Delve went from 8.7 in April to 4.7 in August. Still a drop but not a 90% drop.
---
CCP pays for it. They book your ticket and your room. The hotel still wants a credit card for any spending you decide to do. If you do none, nothing is charged.
---
When I did mine, so many of us were coming from the US that they'd reserve our room so we could check in and sleep. We would get in at 0700 after leaving our home the night before. Check in to the hotels was normally around 1500-1700. So we could check in at 0700. I'd sleep a few hours to get my clock flipped. Then sometimes it was a free day and then meetings or sometimes the meetings started the next day and the free day was at the end.
---
We were close enough to walk to head quarters. Then walked to dinner and everywhere else except for the CCP dinner where we were picked up if it was further away from the walkable city center.
---
CCP did provide breakfast which they did for your staff. Sometimes the hotels had breakfast. CCP also provided lunch in the cafeteria. You paid for dinner. The group dinner at the end CCP paid for.
---
&gt; 99% of the changes favor wormholers’ playstyle
---
top kek m8
---
yeah go fuck yourself, i am not and have never been in a null blob. I'm with a small pvp focused corporation.
---
My character is 3 months old, but im fully aware of how ships and modules are produced as i build t2 ships and modules from moon goo and/or blue loot. 
---
im also fully aware of the risks and the time it takes to export the things i build which is why i'm telling you that you have totally lost perspective on just how good and easy you've had it for so long.
---
nice assumptions though, they totally didnt blow up in your face...
---
remove this system!
---
Everything has become cheaper including plex all you have to do is look at the market graph since blackout. Isk generated has dropped off a cliff meaning solo or small time players get significantly more for their isk generation than previously. The blackout has had a disproportionate affect on isk generation over material generation as isk generation was easier to bot and afk pre-blackout.
---
Then you sureley dont mind how you make 82 Titans out of 20 bucks that are Not even enough to buy its fit...
---
&gt;But that takes my toon out of null sec for a day or two.
---
If you have 1 account with 2 characters then that doesn't matter too much. I used to run chained missions in lowsec with an alt character on my (at the time) only account with a couple of other guys and we would make bank. That gameplay seems to be dead now since it has been so much easier to rat with carriers or afk with a couple of VNIs or mine rocks in a belt.
---
It's called bombers bar and have a blast!
---
Maybe they should have made industrial cyno's be fitable on all ships considered industrial like mining ships. That way you could use ventures for  cheap, prospects for cloaky and procs for tank.
---
More ships, more options.
---
They pay to fly the CSM out to Iceland and also pay for lodging. Food is on the CSM.
---
someone light a cyno so he finds the way
---
I think it was just for rhyming purposes.

---
I'm not so sure - when I was actively hunting in Delve tackled rorquals and got the inhib up before they could cyno, yet panic module allowed goon cap fleets to gate to their rescue.
---
It’s retarded, but the whole change is regarded. The simple change, which preserves the no-tanky ship should light a cyno, would be to make the regular cyno have the same ship limitations as covert cynos, and add Astero to both - now everyone could do logistics, memorials and be smashed when trying to bring in ships in on grids in fleet fights. They do want no more massive fights, right?
---
Or they get a lot of stuck on geometry tickets.
---
Buff their resists a bit and make them invisible to D scan past 5au. Or make them show up as their T1 variant on dscan. I dunno I think we should get weird with it.
---
I mean, the type of gameplay I want is being phased out. Large cap battles and big empires are being actively pushed down. Small game pvp has no interest to me and I'm not going to build expensive things in 0.0 if it's easy to knock down. 
---
If I do stay in 0.0 it'll be in the biggest bluest alliance I can find because there is literally no reason to do anything else based on how they want the game to play.
---
Downvotes, but in a single drop I've killed 3 and forced off 6+ bombers in a slasher.  Just me.  T1 frigs eat bombers.
---
You have an issue when the risk exceeds with the reward,. Which in this case (me mining with a Porp and 3 barges) it does.
---
No doubt the answer is "Your doing it wrong, wheres your Rorq fleet" but most of us small timers don't operate like that.
---
&gt;Im not saying ageis sov is good, but i do think it is way better than fucking SBU fights where the biggest supercap dick just wipes the field regardless of anything else
---
That problem was solved with jump fatigue. There was a period of a few weeks between jump fatigue and fozziesov and it was amazing. There were small groups fighting over sov, escalating with a handful of caps on each side and no sign of the PL/NC/Goon/BL supercap menace to come and take their fun away.
---
Hmm, OK, thanks.
---
Also, thanks to all you guys for trekking up to Iceland for the summit. For all that players fuss about everything, I think most of us really do appreciate the commitment that each of you show to the game that many of us enjoy so much.
---
technically that would have been 20m since you have 2 digits on the right side of the point.
---
3 barges and a porp at least requires you to be on the ball. I wouldn't call it zero effort as i have to refine and transport. People on this sub seem to have a misconception about the average player.
---
Can you point out anywhere in the original post where I said that the PCU numbers are not real?
---
What I did say was that we don't have the data to draw effective conclusions. That focusing on PCU numbers adds nothing to the conversation about chaos. The only people who can say with absolute certainty the effects of the era of chaos on the eve player base is CCP.
---
Like what are these threads even expecting? For u/CCP_falcon to walk in and say "oh jeez, I didn't think of that. We've been looking at the DAU/MAU numbers but we never figured to even take a peek at the PCU. Woah this is big, I'll take this to Hilmar stat."?
---
Not impossible to change, but changing it will give carriers sentry drones again.
---
God this is so cringe, who the fuck cites Reddit comments?
---
Also it’s a lot more complex than just simple supply and demand, but I guess your little Dino brain couldn’t figure that out for itself
---
[autistic screeching intensifies]
---
I like dscan immunity ideas for them but it may actually be too OP from the perspective of ratters and miners.
---
Yep, this exactly. It's not very hard to reset that 3 minute timer.
---
So you want to have ops so people could move jfs to and from jita. I think you underestimate how much volume some of the null courier groups move. Some move a few million m3 per day, doing protection/moveops for all of that would create a large source of burnout for the people that are the ones that need stuff moved.
---
Falcon looks VERY Interested

I get it but also, you should ask yourself [this question.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0NNVm5ajMQ)

---
Reminds me of me and wormholers.
---
&gt; et not experience a drastic reduction on PCU.
---
ofc they did,they scream  it for a years,remove fozzie sov,remove low power citadels,3 cynojammers in system-no shit?maybe 33 will be better?
---
Make war fun in EVE and we will make so much destruction inside that rorq mining will be not enough to supply it,CCP made a war in 0.0 pain in the ass that noone wants to do anymore...We wait for years to have a normal war in 0.0 but yeah...
---
They cover room and flight. The rest is generally on the CSM. Each summit cost me about $1k.
---
The way I was saying put them into a useful role in the anti support place of a fleet but without giving them some OP ehp or damage out put. Also without giving it a super long range scams of their brother cepters. With this, it still put them into range of enemy webs. Making it so they can't just scram kite shit at like 20 kms or something stupid. At the end of the day it's still a low ehp frig that's only go speed going for it with lower end damage out put. 
---
Is scrams not working on it strong ? Yes. But on a ship like a cepter. It's a far less power creep then putting on a very tank ship like a AF
---
Great news for us!

[Here's some CCP Hilmar appreciation](https://www.change.org/p/pearl-abyss-fire-hilmar-veigar-p%C3%A9tursson-aka-ccp-hilmar-without-any-golden-parachutes)
---
I completely understand that sentiment, I think we've all made friends here in Eve and are afraid of losing them. It always sucks when your favorite game dies (rip City of Heroes) but if we need to be real with ourselves that obsessing over things like PCU numbers is unhealthy and counterproductive when we don't have the data to support our conclusions.
---
Industrial cynos got introduced only because else cyno vigils would never light the map again and they said they wanted to keep them the way they are ([source](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/chaos-era-continues-cyno-update/182197)). 
---
But they did not think about that at the start, and if no one said anything, jump freighters would have been able to jump to covert cynos regardless. 
---
So the addition of industrial cynos has nothing to do with balance, it's just another lazy band-aid fix to a more complex problem.
---
I gotta say, seeing you in person reversed a lot of my priors.
---
Sure, the issue was that before it was WAY in favor of the locals to the point that they had to fuck up for hunters to catch them.
---
Now it's cat and mouse.
---
It may still need some refining.
---
I think the risk where it is is good, but other changes should be made to encourage sprawl and then increase the available riches in some manner that isn't simply bounty payments.
---
Looks like an asending 45 degree slope on that white board. Interested in what that is.
---
ESS is kinda fun as a mechanism, both for ratting and roaming. The ratting side of it definitely breaks as social bonds grow more tenuous.

You should actually fine tune your thinking on the two groups.   Because I know there is a lot of cross pollination.   Your thinking only considers the extremes of the player base both of which are smaller than represented on the forums.

Here, you lost this: /s
---
Since you seem to know much more about this than anyone, how do you make t2 ships and modules from blue loot?
---
imo, Choas is necessary to revice a solved game. Sure there's a lot of pain, but this will give CCP a better starting point to incentivise conflict. IF not for restricting massive money making while afk... there would be nothing to fight for. But thats the basic way of looking at it.  
---
Players keep shooting their feet, talking down EVE to get CCP to stop suppressing them. IF youwant to go back to a few months ago, you probably are the problem. Without a stopping massive widespread wealth no one will care what they lose. Tribute was a yawn, and further wars will be too.
---
In this sense, and others, Choas is good for EVE.
---
Did he participate in the alliance tournament? If he didn't he didn't reach ALL the reacheable systems.
---
what does it mean to explore?

If caps can gate to you, youre not bubbling effectively

So its like having a recon fly to the grid/on grid, but with an extra step.  Fantastic.
---
Agree with much of what you said.  There was a post from PA that showed Q4 2018 through Q2 2019 revenue from CCP's portion of Eve Online.  It was 10,000 foot level so no detail about where that revenue was from or what it constituted (to your point).  However, if there are  less players with less accounts it eventually will (at least in nullsec) show a dip in revenue.  I'm not buying 10 accounts worth of skins, I'm only getting 2 accounts worth.  I'm not using my credit card to Plex 5 or 10 accounts to do things for large null blocks, now I'm just running one or two.  I'm hearing the guys running 10+ accounts are just going to let them lapse into alpha status.  The numbers in null are quite drastic, so if Chaos means much less content and lots of null space not being used, it's working quite well.  Whether that's "good for the game" or not, well, I have a hard time seeing how that's good for anyone.  All I do now is look at the fleet pings and decide whether or not to log in.  I'm through traveling 30 jumps to find a few ceptors and a Myrm tethered to a Fort to shoot.
---
yes  and this way   evicted party might  deny loot
---
Yeah. It's up there with the Garmur in being really fun to fly.
---
CCP didnt make the changes to affect jfs but instead to change cap gameplay. Most people i know arent upset about the cyno change.
---
Good post
---
It’s basically the same individuals/types of people who have whines incessantly for years.
---
Most of the food. We ate in the CCP cafeteria a few times, and CCP also paid for one dinner and a round of drinks another time IIRC
---
Can you name the CSM members on the picture?
---
CCP teleported him to polaris as the last system to visit.
---
Lol, you think super ratting is scalable. Thank you for once again proving that you don't know shit about nullsec.   
---
If you mess up, rats will eat your expensive fighters alive. Have fun paying more than you earn. You can only do super ratting effectively on one account.
---
Damage caps on structures are great. It puts a soft cap on the effectiveness of large capfleets so they cant just helicopter dick around and delete a whole region overnight
---
It already is a big blue donut. This game was not designed for risk averse people and the fact you’ve moved from null to high says it all really.
---
I am still finding content everywhere in null, more fights and less ganks. I guess the people who stayed know how to defend their space
---
Carebears think they’re being nerfed and ganking is always getting buffed, gankers think they’re always getting nerfed and carebears are getting buffed 😂

I remember that there were other people that roamed around jove space during the alliance tournament to see if they can. I think there are people that reached or can reach even more systems.

The mistake people are making is they are expecting CCP plays their own game and would identify this difficulty before putting it out there for the players.  The time has come for CCP to actually play their own game like, every day and do the work before making the change.  But hey, more JF's to try and kill and possibly run many out of the game due to the monotony.  Yay chaos....

pirates know the  secret data are moved in capsule along pilot,pirates organise special operation  involving rorqual clone vat bay,they manipulate one of dictors capsules to  cause fake thinking pod pilot died to spawn fresh clone,since pod pilot is alive but just disconnected system that responsible for detecting deatch it cant tell if it really died,system just know that pilot is not responding.... now having fresh clone they prepare him and ambush the explorer,they destroy the ship but they CANNOT destroy the pod,they study pod schematics to know where exacly pilot is positioned and call  someone with ship that carry small caliber guns only to kill the pilot without destroying swhole system,now they take this capsule into their ship and fresh clone replaces dead pilot so he can access secret data stored in capsule,so they know what this mining operation was doing and what shocked  explorers so they decided to report the findings...

SURPRISE PVP BITCHES
---
Please get some lowsec dudes on the show Anarchy is a lowsec alliance with some cool dudes. Show all these people unhappy in null that the game can most definitly be fun again once you consider moving out of null.
---
There are two types of PVP, though. 
---
The one you are referring to is the objective-based PVP side - the "army" model of warfare. Two armies clash over an objective with basic agreed-upon rules of conduct. The sides grind away at each other, ideally with a few decisive battles caused by one side miscalculating risk, and the losing eventually gets kicked out.
---
Many of the problems in army-style, objective-based-PVP side are scale driven. Fozzie sov is full as hell for little fights, but it's not great for bloc-vs-bloc. Same with structures - clearing a few in a localized conflict is fine, clearing a dense region would be awful. There's definitely a lot of room for improvement as conflicts scale up. Having a dynamic and messy map is worthwhile as a good thing, and large blocs have to be involved in this - in mechanical changes that make it easier and more worthwhile for a would-be aggressor to go ahead and aggress, despite the lack of a certain win, instead of turtling up. Aside from FCs having slightly less perfect intel (although eyes in staging systems still work great), this sort of army-style PVP is basically unchanged in the Blackout.
---
The other side of PVP is different, and it's focused on PVE and PVErs rather than objectives. This is the side that's impacted by Blackout. The two sides' interests are less aligned here; conflict is more "accumulators" vs. "terrorists." In general, the bloc position is that if a bloc owns space, it should be secure enough (in the absence of an "army-style" invasion), to let our members PVE in relative peace in that space so they have heavy assets to bring to bear on the "army-style" strategic fights we want (i.e. away from our PVE space). The "terrorists" want to cause problems by making accumulators' Eve lives (and, by extension, their bloc's) more difficult by killing ratters, disrupting logistics, RFing flex and low powered structures, etc. Terrorists are almost by definition not in a position to conduct full-scale wars because they just aren't big enough and/or interested enough in "army-style" warfare. If they were, they wouldn't be terrorists any longer, they'd be an army and adopt the army model of warfare and group structure.
---
Some sub-groups in larger blocs will, of course, be more interested in living as terrorists; large blocs tend to be happy to support these groups in their efforts in harassing competitive blocs' PVE activities, so long as opposing factions aren't able to do the same to their PVErs with a similar level of success. If they are, the terrorists get recalled to home defense duty.

Problem is the ride isn't that enjoyable - too little to shoot.  What happens when people no longer enjoy a ride?  They find a different ride they enjoy.  But you're right, whatever's gonna happen is gonna happen.  No sense in worrying about it as CCP does indeed have deaf ears.

Oh my
---
&gt; I remember that there were other people that roamed around jove space during the alliance tournament to see if they can. I think there are people that reached or can reach even more systems.
---
There were several PL guys (I think Gobbins?) that made a run for it through Jove space after their match was finished

CCP was not happy about this

Damn. Well that's a dumb scam, but i guess it only takes 1 to make a profit. Glad you weren't taken in.

It didn't cost me anything this summit.

They provide hotel breakfast, office lunch (both great) plus a good allotment for dinners and socials. We even treated ourselves a fancy dinner with the allotment we had.

I think CCP were more generous this time, and it was less of a norm to be fancy among the CSM.

Interesting point about gates. Though, it depends what's in between. If a region is "protected" because there are actual people in space, roving gangs will show up on dscan or killmails, and you still have decent intel - if you see a Prospect taking a few gates, you know enough to know that danger lurks, even if you don't know exactly what danger or how much. If a region is "protected" by a gatecamp + 20 empty system between there and a ratting pocket, that's a bit of a different story. A choke-point camp closer to the ratting pocket and someone diligently scanning sigs (or half-assing it with the Agency explo tool) would go a long way to providing that sort of security, wouldn't it, albeit for fewer total systems?
---
Exactly.
---
Thanks. Any feedback on why you dont like my supercap suggestions?
---
20 Dollar is 2 Billion ISK and the Formular following this doesnt make any sense to me
---
&gt;   you realise that this  HTFU elite peeveepee mentality would drive out everyone who didn't want to pvp in highsec? 
---
so we let them create new care bears by not showing them what they dislike about null-sec exist in high-sec already? even with these hypothetical changes what really it would still require high-sec players to actually take part in the events which there is no guarantee hence the "Sandbox" experience. 
---
&gt;  Nobody will play in highsec if you do this: nobody who plays casually  will undock: and bots will move most probably move to wormhole space. 
---
bots already exist in High, low, null, and WH space, and again assuming all high-sec players are care bares is wrong to do. Also we're assuming here that they actually take part or continue as they are I refer back to the Sandbox statement before
---
&gt; Why do people stay in nullsec despite the risk? It's profitable. Given  that, why would you stay in highsec given that it'd become a peeveepee  battle royale with no reward to offer for those who want to stay. 
---
the only profit to be made in null sec goes to the corporation who hold null sec and leaves any new corps trying to claim their own territory left with 3 options assimilate, pod express or fight and inevitable lose quite a lot.
---
This hypothetical idea puts 2 possibilities out there.
---
first the player base is better then ever and people will do what they have to do or they'll fold up shop and walk away for the short time this would exist. It would be a nice social experiment if nothing else.
---
Now I can agree that players would stop it's inevitable that some players who dislike pvp, myself included would see this as a horrible idea, the forced pvp not the total blackout, I suck at pvp but understand the necessity of it, but my opinion still stands if someone is going to ruin one area of the game I sure as shit don't want it to be someone who hasn't even stepped foot into a single null sec system or those who just day tripped into it and died once 5 years ago to have any say about where I lived for 75% of my eve time.
---
The whiteboard is awfully empty for a company trying various ideas.
---
The timing
---
It's directly taken from a law sir
---
Sure - send them my way. I want to have them on the show.  [https://discord.gg/hKhxq4m](https://discord.gg/hKhxq4m)  This is where we meet and plan.
---
What law?
---
Math law
---
So explain that to me. What happened to make you get more fights? Also, I didn't leave null, I just moved my isk making to high. Which in my opinion is stupid for the game but better financially for me.
---
Nothing will cement the thousand year Reich of the existing power blocs like this smoothbrain logic right here.
---
Link it? I dont know any law that would make about 30 Times the value out of a Single investment
---
  Your statement may of been true under a super umbrella.   But not in my case or that of a lot of other players.
---
Fix the gap in yo toofs first!
---
There's no multiplication by 30 going on
---
Stop gap shaming the Bustard.
---
It's just a poor industrial trying to make ends meet
---
r/eve is arthas, killing him will unleash the scourge that is forum posters
---
They have build Citadel mechanics on top of corp and alliance mechanics, I don't think corp mechanics are on their todo.
---
Right as fucking rain they'd up and leave for the duration of it. Do you have any idea of the average highseccer? They literally mine highsec ore so they have no chance of dying. If they're that focused on not dying, why for the life of god would they even undock?
---
&gt;So starting over, 20$=2 billion (rounded) isk, meaning you get get about (255*4.5)/14=about 82 titans. Again, these numbers are taken from a law and thus they don't need a proof, they are just right.
---
&gt;Titans in average make 45.5 million dps, so each ship has to have that and 1 extra ehp to be able to survive one second.
---
&gt;Let's say you play the game normally, you make 10m isk per day, doing the numbers (2700*10)/10 it'll take you exactly 2700 days to buy one titan.
---
&gt;But don't worry! You don't have to do anything as I did the math for you!
---
Might be because you ran as a wormhole representative in a large nullbloc
---
someone doesn't know the difference between hunting and farming. Hunting is never a gurantee of a kill or even a gurantee that you will find prey. go to a big alliance area and be a "Elite Hunter" or as they're really thought of, the "handicap farmers"
---
Which part?
---
It gets even bigger
---
You jump from a Single investment worth 2b isk to Titans worth almost 5t isk so i feel like there is quite a massive gap to be filled
---
Yeah me as well. I submitted it, now we wait
---
The law fills it
---
Thank you for your data Jester. It's always nice to see solid numbers rather than political spin from the company. It also supports this amazing meme.

After the amount of time and effort the OP has put in, I refuse to believe this is a troll. Some people are just genuinely that retarded.

TAPIrium salt has the best quality!!

Question, did you try it?   I was going to do that this weekend and couldn't get to it.
---
This isnt a valid answer bud cause we are suddenly jumping from a $20 investment to a $98400 investment so if you dont mind id like to have anything that properly explain that law and how to use it before one even can take you serious.
---
I don't understand why you think telling people, "the game is fun, just don't play where you live" is a good mentality. Plus if you tell all the people in null to move to lowsec, who would be your targets?
---
The worst thing is, that I just recently spotted the gaps. After getting my skills to fly it. I feel like s\*\*t now ;\_;
---
That's actually kind of cool they did that since no other way that's legit.
---
An upvote for City of Heroes. I have some fond memories of that game.
---
Back in the day, conventional wisdom held that you couldn't run a big team without an empath defender and a tank. Instead, I ran teams with 7 blasters and myself, a force field defender. We even cranked the difficulty up as far as it would go. Every time I'd invite a blaster to the team, they'd get a look at the composition and wonder what the hell we were smoking, it'd never work, etc. But my veterans from past teams would calm them down and reassure them.
---
Maxed out forcefields + maxed leadership auras... and the pool healing powers. Everyone said they sucked, but they were just enough to patch up a random team memeber when an enemy attack managed to get through the shields. Good times.
---
The money supply shows the same thing as your first point.
---
Wait so did they decide to not implement the change for JFs being able to use a cov ops cyno? I was considering buying a JF now just because of that change. Being able to JF to a cyno that doesn't just become and instantly warpable target and only lasts 30 seconds? Fuck yea!
---
Fortunately in Eve you can commit ritualistic seppuku as many times as you desire.
---
Actually, I am going to unsub from /r/eve today. You guys make liking this game hard.
---
yeah, I have a pretty good idea of the average high sec player I started as one and was there for about a year. but again you're assuming all high sec players are the same. The same question can also be asked anywhere. why do other players in low, null and WH space undock if its so bad? why do they even play eve at all if they aren't going to do X activity? or even better why ruin others game when they themselves don't do the thing they're complaining about?
---
Cool
---
Everywhere I go there are roaming gangs/camps or defence fleets. The exception to this is during off peak times for various regions depending on who holds sov. But yes more fights and more content. 
---
Your last sentence. You may think that but the isk you make in high sec is less- so it’s not better financially for you. Unless you are unable to make isk in null because of no local, which was kind of my point in the first place. High sec is safer and that is how it should have always been
---
Something something, the little guy, something something.
---
In the POS code
---
Says the dude in Horde
---
Nope. We need 400 titans worth of stuff to die each month to stop proliferation. None of the things people defend will significantly improve destruction significantly. I get that things like tz tanking make it harder to have large wars. But none of the things people say will make it so that groups are more even and people actually fight with titans head on.
---
I'm amazed at NS hate boner for sleeper loot, but sure remove local from wormhole space fine.
---
It's separate containers
---
What is the min align time, then?
---
I read that and was like, "well, marauders are pretty common for lvl4 missions...".  But then I read it again and was like, "... oh."
---
To each their own, though.
---
Where can I get the original, I am ready to meme!
---
Hilmar probably: \*Just one more month of this bullshit and I can say goodbye forever\*
---
I don't think it's a trivial qualifier, since it introduces a dimension of skill into the achievement.
---
Remove ansiplex gates I’ve been saying that for ages. They are anti content. 
---
Limiting wormhole spawn locations is a bit of a stretch - they can be closed. And goons/test regularly so close them.
---
Amount of salt being generated on /r/eve
---
HOW DARE
---
It could work in theory but that's way to much coordination for most the F1 monkeys
---
Just over 3 sec with faction istabs, rigs, + expensive nomads
---
He thinks goons control the CSM. Thus the GSM controls CCP. Nothing could be further from reality. Like any teen, CCP does what they want.
---
Idk man i think only the power of a marauder could tank the truly outrageous dps of a Serpentis Hideaway. Did you know the third wave has a chance to spawn THREE frigates?
---
I suppose so. I don't think not dying is the difficult part though.
---
IF YOU DELETE C4/C5 WHAT THE HELL ARE NESTORS FOR????
---
I'm not subbing accounts in any way shape or form. 😑
---
So if the null alliances move to lowsec, would your alliance still have the fun they have now?
---
but you smart, he no
---
Anyone ever spotted the peen under the Impel?
---
Yup. Community REEEEEEE'd so hard they made industrial cynos instead.
---
TBH I'm pretty sure it's CCP trolling at this point. They made a good solution that people didn't like because they couldn't freeskill alts to it in days, so they made this as a "well, you asked for it..."
---
I think one of the biggest problems is that space isn't valuable enough. The largest entity in the game has an absurd glut of resources from controlling a single region of space.  What's their incentive to try to capture more territory? 
---
There needs to be caps on the amount of isk/ minerals/loot that can be gained in a given system. 
---
This would force miners/ratters to spread out,  which would make it harder to defend and multi box, while also increasing incentive to try to capture space from other alliances.
---
Slope is nowhere near vertical enough.
---
Agreed. My reply was more sarcasm, and in lieu of your suggestion. I do like your suggestion though. 
---
An inverse of your suggestion could be a super high warp strength (no scramming them), and just leave them be. That way they are effective tackle ships that don't die immediately. Yea, webs would be the defense against them.
---
I love this. After beating me on that timer the other day, all of you putting 'gf' in stream chat was amazing. Keep it up guys.
---
Kinda related I think the festival launchers are some of the coolest things they’ve implements and maybe there’s still room in the future for festival cynos that can be lit in hisec. We’ll see anyways. For now this will have to do. I’m not worried much. My playstyle is the cloakies so as long as my covert cyno is pretty much safe I’m happy. 
---
Side note: I’m gona start fitting festival launchers on my dreads. :)
---
1. Reduce ISK generated by bounties. 
---
2. Increase spawn time based on ADM Levels. 
---
3. Actually have rats which dont act like dumb bots. If they uses the AI for the npc sotiyos this would be a fresh change. Increases the difficulty and forces players to work together as you need some pvp ships and some pve ships to complete sites.
---
ikr why isn't every idea they've ever had up there stupid ccp
---
I've been a paying customer since 2003. Im abstaining until they balance this mess and encourage other gameplay that doesn't involve subbing 20 accounts to have a super alt, fax alt, titan alt, Intel alt, market alt and being a blob coalition doing stratboos that always consist of grinding some cheap citadel with a fleet 1000 times the price of said citadel. 😑
---
Without a scout, through all WH and NS systems in a ship that is not nullified?  Its quite an achievement...
---
Oh I see you've done the same as a noob ? 😄
---
Now I get why you usually put music on your videos !
---
Think it was fact he did it on stream is why he was excited
---
Maybe you’re on mobile but if not, it is perfectly permissible to use paragraphs.
---
I understand what you’re saying but what you’re doing is to hijack a pod. I don’t know how you would do that without the pilot being aware of that. Being aware of their surroundings is the point of being a pod pilot.
---
What you describe I understand as: we capture a pod, we decant the pilot, we kill the pilot and then take that pod.
---
If the pod is in the Rorqual’s clone bay you just need to decant the pilot and kill him.
---
What am I missing?
---
? You may disagree with the direction but you can’t believe that he isn’t committed to eve
---
There were plenty of alternatives for blackout suggested. Keeping the number of people in local shown, possibly with a delay is my favorite. Null guys are mad because they got wormholes space local copy pasted and not their own form of local that is suited for nullsec. Its just lazy and half assed. 
---
Im salty because there has been a string of nerfs to ratting carriers, FAX and roqs before the blackout. Most of these were really good balance changes.HAWS off titans is great, I think most dudes would agree that the multiple ASB made roqs far too bricktanked. the FAX changes were also good. I'd say the fighter application nerf was debatable and so was the anomaly respawn nerf. My own suggestion would have been balance cap ships around PVP entirely. When all the caps are in a decent place with hitpoints and damage application to subs they can mess with the anomalies so they are paying out an acceptable amount. Right now it just feels they are throwing out balance passes at random with no real goal or vision in mind. When that didnt work hilmar was like i dono delete local lol, then the madman actually did it.
---
It doesn't mention any of that, and it's definitely not accurate anyways. I recall for a fact they said Signal Cartel was used to help scout some of the last systems. The achievement stands on its own, without any qualifiers or made up shit.
---
It's a ship with zero combat capabilities. I don't really get the "risk free" argument in this particular instance.
---
They undock because there's a reasonable compensation for their risk. In highsec, there really isn't.
---
That would be some beautiful carnage right there!
---
Conroywildstar for CSM!
---
Why stay where you are unhappy while you could be having fun?
---
With jump fatigue the helicopter dicking regions isn't a thing any more.
---
&gt; I think the only people with the proper metrics to track if chaos changes are good or bad for the game is CCP as we have no way to see MAU/DAU ratios, retention curves, or discern W1 retention. Furthermore we have no way to roughly sort accounts by mains, alts, bots, etc.
---
We can see online player counts, not simply PCU. Online players really the most important number for the health of the game. If you have a high MAU but nobody is staying logged in long enough to do anything you still have a dead game and a lot of players at risk of leaving. There are plenty of other statistics interesting to CCP that should be tracked, but a steadily dropping weekly PCU should be setting off klaxxons at the CCP offices.
---
There is also a lot more data which doesn't provide the things you say, but where we can make good estimates of the trends.
---
Your notion that only CCP can see the health of the game in an objective way is hilariously naive.
---
He literally is making changes to suit a narrative instead of game health
---
He is absolutely committed to a “part” of eve, but the game in whole?  Not at all
---
adapt or die, we don't need highsec botters
---
So eliminate defender advantage but leave the ability for attackers to freely move. Did you even read his post?
---
What's the stats on kills in the last 2 months vs. previous months? Is PvP up or down?
---
I m not responsible for the quality of others.
---
Also get 1 fight of quality suck; we need more action.

Ah, now I know why my USTZ kills have taken a hit. Thanks for the analysis.
---
I take it that is the only day that you play EVE.
---
Which part is he wrong about?
---
what the fuck not everyone in highsec is a botter yet near everyone in highsec doesn't want a blackout and removal of concord
---
whaaaat?
---
I love how you think the game was healthy pre blackout
---
You’d think that, until the freighter jettisons 10,000 shuttles.
---
Look, you just don't get it. The game is totally fun if you just, you know, move to a different part of space, use different ships, do different things, and log into a different client.
---
Honestly, check out this amazing screenshot! I'm having a blast in space!
---
https://i.imgur.com/TBCHwXq.jpg
---
(Seriously, though. I will never understand the 'The game is totally fun if you just play it the way **I** want you to!' mindset. People need to stop telling people how they can or can't play EVE, and encourage folks to find their own way however they can.)
---
It's incredibly ignorant to think that what is fun for you, is fun for everyone. Not everyone enjoys wormholes, not everyone enjoys null, and not everyone enjoys low. Some people love living in highsec. 
---
The point is, telling people that only one area of the entire game should be fun is unbelievably selfish and shortsighted. Saying such a massive player drop is good for the game is so ridiculous is inarguable. 
---
I'm not saying that a change wasn't necessary for the game, however I think CCP's implementation of changes is shortsighted at best, and destructive to the player base at worst.
---
Who is the guy on the right? I like that shirt. Brand and where to get?
---
&gt; Play the game my way and LIKE IT!
---
https://getsharex.com/ you fuckin' tube.
---
Hilmar has the face of the great days. For sure, blackout doing well like intended, especially on the player base.
---
You can still take gates. Its not a thing because all of the timers for a alliance/region are set to the same timeslot, so you can only hit 2-3 of them while the others auto-repair. That and the thing that matters are the ihub/tcu, and those are entosis, which have little to do with caps. 
---
When helicopter dicking you would SBU an entire region and then swing thru when the timers all came out and smash all of thier tcus, stations, and ihubs. Moons could be seperately but just the same way.
---
Now you can spam entosis nodes, and probably get a handful of the timers you made, but its a big mess of subcaps.
---
&gt; (Seriously, though. I will never understand the 'The game is totally fun if you just play it the way I want you to!' mindset.

I love how you think killing the game is the solution

It never has been impossible and you’re wrong for thinking i assume that

---
In fact in recent history almost every change has favoured nullblobbers. More recently CCP have also put some focus on casual highseccers (wardec changes). Even if he's talking about blackout era changes - and there is an argument that removing local favours wormholers' playstyle - you've also had drifter invasion (nothing to do with wormholes), triglavians in HS (favouring high sec PVEers) and now cyno changes (don't affect wormholers).
---
I disagree. EVE wasn't meant to be just a non-stop stream of meaningless encounters. At least not in the beginning. - Tho it sure seems that's where CCP are taking us.
---
More CHaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaOS! 
---
Ship warp speed is random! Somewhere between 0.5 and 8 AU/sec. It can change mid-warp too!
---
Randomly, a module will go offline while you are in space!
---
Sometimes there will be no damage cap when shooting a structure!
---
When shooting a structure there is a 33.33333333333% chance that you can proceed into directly the next layer (Shield -&gt; armor, armor -&gt; hull) without having to come back!
---
Ships deteriorate while idle. The longer you don't fly a hull the larger the amount of hull and armor is damaged there is on the ship. This damage will cost 200,000 isk/hp to repair, regardless of the settings on the structure for repair services. Tether can't fix it either! Yes, the ship will eventually disappear, taking its modules and cargo with it!
---
There is a maximum number of capital ships that can be docked in an Upwell Structure. If the structure is a capacity, when a new cap ship docks, the oldest one there is ejected into space! The only capital ships that dock in NPC stations are jump freighters!
---
Probably-awful idea I had after reading this: make combat ceptors able to lock their warp drives onto hostile ships. Give brawly doctrines a way to fight kitey doctrines.
---
Correct
---
Oh wait..
---
Welcome to the world, this has been public knowledge for weeks. If you want to reset the 3 minute timer you have to sacrifice a rookie ship with a point.
---
his laughter made is so much more organic tho, some shitty text in the corner on a blacked out section being like "i tagged a rag and got internet points lul" is just boring to watch.
---
I like your image of a sailor bitching at the ocean for not making sailing easy. Learn to swim buttercup.
---
So who is fighting now that wasn't fighting before? Because honestly where I am, no one is. And looking at the regions kills over 24h, it doesn't look like many regions have ANY real fights at all. I mean Delve looks like it had a big fight, LXQ has some as well, but there are tons of regions with basically no kills in the last 24. 
---
And yes, I can make more isk super ratting or something but this is actively being.... harmed I guess is the word, with the changes. If the idea is to lower the number of supers AND make it easier to kill them, how is it better for me in 0.0 ratting? 
---
Let's say I get a super out there after the changes and it gets caught and I die. Ok, so I'm out 20b. So I have to go buy another one and try to regain the 20b and more. What's to stop these guys from coming back the next day or so? So I have a few options, go to a more heavily defended area where I make isk like crazy, die constantly and eventually just have to stop because I'm broke, downgrade to like a throwaway BC and just rat all the time to make up for lost isk/hr or go somewhere else like highsec where I can min/max my isk production basically without fear. Also I don't have to pay for like sov bills (which for a mid level alliance is billions and billions a month).
---
So what is the main goal? If supers/caps are removed as isk makers, the whole "You can make more in 0.0" goes away or make it so the coalitions are even tighter packed and they don't lose ratters? Am I supposed to be ratting in supers or not?
---
&gt; yeah go fuck yourself
---
That escalated quickly.
---
&gt; My character is 3 months old
---
Point proven.
---
&gt; nice assumptions though, they totally didnt blow up in your face.

You are correct, I was assuming you were a complete noob and you confirmed it. Carry on newbro,
---
SELLING TO THE STUPID NULLBEARS WHO GOT BAITED INTO BUYING TITANS AND SUPERS AND NEED IT FOR REFITTING?
---
The alternative is your playing a game that roughly 25% of the playerbase are/were bots. Thats fucking shocking.
---
Bollocks.
---
I would want to see SOE FAX actually. It could be like a Nestor, suited to a logistics role but PvP capable
---
Not really because you could always log some cyno alts off in various ratting systems and skip over whatever choke points or intel gathering is set up. That's what I'd do.
---
still takes time to reprogram all the bots in eve to start farming black lotus on fairbanks. drop off is still going to continue for some time.
---
Reasonable compensation for risk? high risk low reward in null unless you mindlessly rat all day compared to no risk in low reward in highsec. And that's only comparing mining and ratting, exploration is always a money maker wherever you go, mission running can be consistent income with little risk in highsec.
---
Or the man dying of thirst in the desert and yelling at the sand for not being wet?
---
how do they wear clothes and cosmetic items?
---
Well, my first though is: Who are you, exactly, that we should be rewriting the game to fit *your* changing life-style? This game has always required an intense time investment. This was clear from day one. - Expecting them to change the game because you don't have time to play that anymore is somewhat preposterous.
---
Second thought: if you only have two hours to play per day, how about spend a day or two doing some planning and prep work, so that when you do go out you have a solid target and a reasonable chance to actually get a kill? - 90% of this game is planning and preparation. If you aren't willing to do that, then guess what, you're gonna kind of suck at it.
---
Bounties and Sleeper loot are the two biggest direct isk activities. When CCP cuts null bounties to a third of what it was and don't touch sleeper loot at all, it's a massive buff to WH income because WH absolute isk income stayed the same during a period of isk deflation, while the income of Null isk fell far below what deflation is able to compensate for. While sleeper loot continue to pump 18 trillion per month, no matter how much ratting income falls deflation will never be enough that ratters see their buying power recover. This is when Wormholes already give anywhere from 3-7x the isk per hour for a similar investment (e.x. dual boxed dreads+webber earns around to 5x isk/hour as a similar investment in super ratting + Fax on standby for the umbrella.)
---
It's the problem of two actives intrinsically linked by providing the same commodity (raw isk) into a common market. A nerf to one is a buff to the other, and the market will never adjust to fit the nerfed one as long as the other one is un-nerfed.
---
HELL YEAH BROTHER
---
Maybe that's just for the picture?
---
&gt; As an example: in the past, highsec incursion running was a valid, sustainable way to make enough isk to plex your accounts, and was optimally done by people using a single account as part of a fleet due to the amount of attention required to not lose your ship. That gameplay died when the optimum way to make isk was with 20 multiboxed rorquals sitting in a belt.
---
This is a shitty example, and you actually have them reversed. Taking a mining rorqual and adding another one is an easy way to scale up your income, but the game mechanics are such that you're perfectly fine running a single rorqual. Adding more scales linearly with the number of rorquals.  In the past though, incursion running strongly benefited those who multiboxed the incursions, if you could run the incursion on your own by multiboxing 10 accounts you gained a tremendous advantage far more than the linear isk gains as it removed your dependence on others.
---
Cyno changes remove easy response fleets to invading nullsec. Local blackout allows better raiding by wormholers. 
---
Also look at this massive list of changes that only buff nullsec:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cs3pir/z/excx49o
---
Please show me changes that make it harder for wormholers.
---
“number of leet kills by the skilled bomber pilots”
---
If you kill enough memorial cynos maybe you can sell the LO and replace your sin
---
And POS will roam again
---
CCP have been saying they've banned shitloads of bots over and over again for years, even teleporting bots to highsec for extra effect. Now either they were totally ineffective previously (so what makes this time different?) or CCP lied.
---
Vily and ron get killed by raptors though D:
---
This is a really good idea and I really want them to be more useful. Even if they dont have some perk like this a buff to pg/cpu would be acceptable. My poor unloved Crusader :(
---
this is literally my dream
---
It's incredible how gigantically retarded you are.
---
Show me on the doll where the blackout touched you
---
That's always been the case, though - logging cloaky sabres or prospects was the only way to catch carriers for a long time, at least without using blue tackle.
---
Give Warp Disruptors and Scramblers strength bonus.
---
After watching your streams and seeing that everytime you get jumped i'll just hear him say "clever girl"
---
So many problems with your text. You can still rat in supers. That’s your call. The virtual 100% safety of the old days was the problem. You undock a super in space you should be at risk, period. You have chosen to go to high sec where the isk you can make is greatly reduced. The isk that was printed in nullsec was a problem and it would appear CCP is having a positive impact in that regard as skill injected super pilots who have no idea how to PvP are no longer able to warp anom to anom and print isk. 
---
The umbrellas will still function as before but now the instant cyno up defence fleet in will be gone. Communication and planning will come in to it and in some cases you will be left to the wolves. And your 100m ticks will have been a waste of money when your 20b super dies. You say what am I supposed to do rat in a throwaway bs - yes that’s exactly it. If you are making a hundred mill an hour you are a fool if you use a ship worth 20b.
---
have you seen him? he eats for 200$ a day.
---
OR BECAUSE HE SPENT A YEAR SEEDING A WORMHOLE!!
---
Mission running with a blackout and no concord? Exploration? Highsec is more cramped than null, how do you think you won't get gatecamped to shit?
---
Are you comparing 3 mil ticks to 18 mil ticks? They're both shit, sure, but in relative terms, one is definitely better.
---
Fix the gap in your knowledge about decent image sharing services, son
---
if you run an XLASB you can use crystals to get more hp out of each boost
---
Nah man I have a plan on place. I’m stocking up on cases of whiteclaw to sell to Rasta when they finally run out of whiteclaw in his state and he needs me to send them to him. That’s how I’ll replace my Blops in the future.
---
It's just a pass through thermal exaust shaft.
---
Yes because rampant botting, turbo inflation, and NAPs with every entity within 4 regions is a healthy game
---
Unsecured for you, secured for sleepers!
---
All true. We really need to start poking at CCP for hard data on the topic. How many accounts have actually ceased subscribing? Is there any estimate to individual players that have left? And is there new player growth/decline as a result of blackout?
---
I just think that some of the drop could be attributed to this multi-&gt; singlebox transition based on anecdotal evidence. Some of the drop could be attributed to a reasonably steady decline that was already occuring pre-blackout. Some decline in the MER might be due to perception (yep, chanting eve is dead eve is dead Eve is dead might actually make it happen). And some is definitely due to blackout itself. I want real numbers though.
---
Revisiting that threads just reminds me why you're not worth the time tbh. Minor tweaks CCP made to reduce how much they overbuffed null with excavators, Upwell structures and instant anomaly respawn don't count as nerfs in the long term. They also have nothing to do with "favoring wormholers’ playstyle" so you're trying to move the goalposts.
---
&gt; Cyno changes remove easy response fleets to invading nullsec
---
Maybe so but *roaming is not only done by wormholers*, and in fact the game would be much better if people could roam in small gangs more easily and generate small scale content.
---
lol thank you all I kept thinking is man they love Magic so much!
---
2 billion will not buy you 82 titans..
---
Heck,. it won't even be enough for the fittings of a titan.
---
TIS started off strong but now the content is stale and circlejerky and the discord is just garbage
---
If you mess up?
---
How?
---
I've watched videos of super ratting and it's pretty much 90% "next target, click next fighters main weapon, maybe 2 fighters if it's a battleship"
---
Iirc there was someone who scanned his way into Jove space before the scanning system was changed.
---
It was real good for a long while. I was briefly a patreon some time ago, but their discord being "for everyone" really means don't tell people they're wrong and show why or it's harassment. Unless you're a Bloc leader, then you can hurl insults as you're a valued class of people.
---
I told you ganking is killing Eve and H&amp;co will eliminate it, if you are ganker free your assets and go to another game, eg. Rust ...
---
OK. First, it's just an idea. After spending hours roaming or moving fleets to some op. It doesn't concern player skill or leeeeeet pvp skills. It's just thinking about wasted time. That would be more productive than staring at the warp screen.
---
And dude. It's an idea. If you like to spend time waiting at the warp screen it's ok. I just posted here to read some feedback if there's people who feel the same
---
&gt; not using imgur
---
pls
---
Bro haven't you heard of the national shortage??
---
Ironic.
---
What's wrong with Lightshot?
---
Honest question here.
---
I've been using it for pretty much 5 years, and Haven't had any issues so far.
---
IIRC there is a way to do this with view and take rights. I set it up for an old corp a few years ago. Something about not having view rights, but them still appearing in the manufacturing window. I'd mess around with it on an alt when no one is around.
---
It s good!
---
Thanks!
---
Expensive but good. Best lamb in the world. Best fish in the world.
---
Of course some special viking recipe are horrible but not everybody eat it now.
---
And making all legit players quit isn’t the solution
---
First, null leaders and CSM members are not game designers.  It's not their role to invent an "alternative mechanism".  
---
The last 3 CSM groups have all expressed to CCP the risks involved with the continued use of carrier ratting, rorqual mining, and other similar activities.  This can be found in the minutes of each previous summit. 
---
This current CSM is also in favor balancing the economy and finding a good, engaging way forward and has made that clear to CCP.  
---
From the data from groups I'm involved with and have access to activity metrics (not CCP data), I can see a significant reduction in not just PVE activity, but in PVP activity.  Basically, players simply not playing EVE anymore, that previously played in a range of activities PVE and PVP.  The drops in participation are not simply not logging in "accumulation-focused players", it is wide ranging dissatisfaction.  The problem is real. 
---
Again, it's not the job of anyone but CCP to come up with solutions to this issue.
---
We dont need 400 titans bcos when is war you cannot mine like  when is not,enemy will drop in your  region,you can see when goons deployed that they mined 50% less than when they sit home,but war is boring now, even if you cut isk/mineral flow with blackout and cyno changes you will destroy 0.0 and most famous EVE thing and that is massive wars that hit all headlines of gaming media.We all come to 0.0 to have those wars,not fozzie sov or bombers online meta games...
---
He put his seed in a wormhole?!
---
&gt; every manager/director in every mt
---
I can tell you what I don't do in meetings with people from outside my unit. Look at my phone.
---
At best you will have 1 month of war vs 11 months of farming. It seems like war is hard
---
Revers Maunti ;)
---
yes ;)
---
I have no clue what any of the CSM people look like and I 100% know which one is Olmeca.
---
I work in an office environments and we have ideas all over the walls and windows.
---
You people love to claim nullsec has received nothing but buffs, but when provided with a list of nerfs you say "oh those are only balance changes" but can't provide a list of the supposed buffs nullsec has received. Why is it that when confronted with facts you refuse to refute? 
---
And it buffs small gangs which is the playstyle favored by wormholers, so I would say it favors wormholes.
---
I disagree with the point that "there are two kinds of players in Eve".  It is reductionist.
---
People enjoy a multitude of playstyles and cannot be pigeon-holed so easily. 
---
Trying to bring the complexity of what motivates EVE players into an "us vs. them" dichotomy is counterproductive.
---
Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.
---
*I am copy pasting this from a bot, and this action was performed manually. Please do nothing if you have any questions or concerns.*
---
Guess that's what happens when Noraus pays you to back him. Now is it ISK or Yuan?
---
"Legit" Lol
---
Cries the dude living in a wormhole. Lol. Come play with the big boy super umbrellas without crying your little heart out.
---
&gt;There are plenty of other statistics interesting to CCP that should be tracked, but a steadily dropping weekly PCU should be setting off klaxxons at the CCP offices.
---
Oh It is concerning me, don't get me wrong. Personally I think Eve has been doing what it has been doing for years, living out it's middle age years as an MMO. However I'm going to admit that I can't say that is what is actually going on and I'm not going to start jumping to conclusions and freaking out saying the game is literally weeks away from dying because fact of the matter is that I don't have the data to drive such an assertion. 
---
&gt;Your notion that only CCP can see the health of the game in an objective way is hilariously naive.
---
Am I the naive one or just the one that isn't going to get hysteric over A.) Something I can't control and B.) Something I don't have the ability to check without making wild assumptions?
---
&gt;We can see online player counts, not simply PCU. Online players really the most important number for the health of the game. If you have a high MAU but nobody is staying logged in long enough to do anything you still have a dead game and a lot of players at risk of leaving. 
---
I'm sorry but I can't agree with this statement. We can't divine the health of the game based on that. A game doesn't have to have many players on for 4-6 hour sessions to be considered healthy. There could be a plethora of reasons for the MAU count to be high while the number of online players is low. One example from the top of my head is "what if players are logging in frequently but spending their time doing low intensity and low time commitment activities like running 3-5 abyssals (roughly 1 hour worth of time spent logged in) daily before bed or work?" The game wouldn't be dying then, it would just be a shift in what activity people are doing in the game. We can't tell these trends without other metrics. Metrics we don't have. So why worry?
---
It's running again. It wasnt turned off due to CCP. More like their contract expired and couldn't be renewed.
---
you can already do this with station containers...
---
just give them view access but not take access and then they can make all the copies they want.
---
&gt; I've watched videos of super ratting     
---
Right, as I've said, you're basically an expert on these things. 
---
People who make videos of it are often shit. They don't rat in the most effective way. It's more effective to volley battleships with one shot of all three heavy fighters. So you are constantly switching targets.     
---
Sure, you could multibox two supers in lazy mode. I have never heard of anyone doing that, and I would guess you make like 120% the money of one properly piloted super, while having double the risk of losing a 16-20B ship. That's about how scalable that is.          
---
I don't rat in lazy mode and I still occasionally lose fighters. They die very fast, if they have aggro and stand still.
---
&gt;I work in an office environments
---
Oh great! I didn't realize your qualifications and expertise on this subject! I apologize, lauded office worker. Make sure you bring this up with CCP and teach them how to organize meetings and notes!
---
I'm not sure either because I know there is the option to lock down BPOs. I do know how much of a PITA that is though because you have to do it for each BPO individually and the directors have to vote on it. If you have to move them it is the worst.
---
Local players, Judge and Sort Dragon being flown in from Australia. ;)
---
All im saying to all the salty people, is adapt
---
Adapting can also be moving and having fun again
---
Regarding the blackout, i hated it in null was super salty, now im back in empire and idgaf and am having fun again.
---
Play however you want man, but if you arent having fun and are feeling frustrated, maybe try something else?
---
You-Their playstyle is wrong!
---
Also you-its a sandbox!
---
Pick one you fucking buffoon
---
First, fuck off because no one cares about your idea which is identical to the thousands of other posts on the topic of blackout.
---
Second, there is no second.
---
Dam did not think someone could hate me that much :-)
---
Ofc in reality it's a continuum and not a pure split. Doesnt mean the poles of the continuum aren't there
---
Same difference. We don't get to control the environment. We just get to deal with it and fight to strive nonetheless. Thankfully you'll respawn once you die of thirst.
---
youre a unit tbh
---
I was unaware that Goonswarm Federation has the biggest economic base. I always thought they were trolls. I wonder if any of their corporations are recruiting.
---
Never seen someone clutch their caffeine so hard lol.
---
Its been said many times and no im not a game designer. People stay in the space they live because 
---
1. its a pain to move&gt; Like if dude a wants to go try group b they have to sell everything its super annoying. 
---
2. Mining and PVE are faucets because CCP has never gone down the road to make these things run out. You don't need to leave your space because belts don't take longer to spawn over time. Rats don't get fewer and fewer as they are farmed. Space that a entity sits in never looses or gains in value until a major change happens.
---
Also, blackout isn't doing shit but killing the smaller entities that want to live in null sec. It made WH the best 0.0 space to live in.
---
This is so bad that I adore it  
---
Advanced warp targeting computers allow for intercepting the enemy combat fleet
---
No, dude. College classes started back up again for the college age eve players (less than 12% of the total player base)--and this is 10th or 11th week in a row college classes have started back up again--and null sec bots are still quitting the game. Duh.
---
wow a whole 77 people signed it in 2 weeks lmao
---
The salt is so tasty.. please tell me how it's all gone to shit sweet summer child.. sit on my lap and cry yourself till you have no more tears.. they are so sweet, so salt..
---
Don’t forget to add fatigue to make it extra tedious
---
Third, that's my point, Sherlock. LOL
---
&gt;PvP is when people can fight back, pure and simple
---
The only thing pure and simple here is how wrong and dumb you are. PVP is any time a player engages another player. Iim not sure if you noticed but it's quite literally in the name.
---
Sorry you're dumb.
---
FUCK YOU, FIGHT ME    
---
...IN HONORABRU COMBAT
---
OH HAHAHAHA YOU WERE JUST PRETENDING TO BE RETARDED HAHAHA I GET IT HAHAHAHA
---
It's a game. You absolutely get to control if you decide to enter the environment.
---
Double the warping speed doesnt mean it will be a stream of meaningless encounters! Have you smoked lol?
---
They need to have a good cry.. their whole world is crashing down around them in this moment
---
Actual wars generate maybe a few weeks of content before one side folds, evacs and leaves the other to flip systems under occasional harassment.
---
THE BLACKOUT IS EVEN COMING FOR BREAD
---
bring back local with zero delay so fights can happen again, and permanently force anyone who complain about instant local to live in wormholes exclusively.
---
Implying content correlates to where you're willing to jump freighter things lol.. honestly, if you won't do it, someone else will, and will charge more due to demand. You think pvpers stop cause your jfer stops? I think you're a bit full of yourself
---
Better than being you.
---
\&gt;  (255\*4.5)/14=about 82 titan
---
According to the same law, ((255.255\*4.5)/7 -9)\*7 = about 1085 numberwangs.
---
Everyone knows 1085 numberwangs &gt; 82 titans, so EVE is not pay to win.
---
Yeah... Yeah I know... :(
---
Got em
---
Hey you guys in the fishing trawler! You’re fucking doing it wrong! There shouldn’t be fishing in our ocean. There should only be waaarrrr!!
---
Compare with this: https://imgur.com/Jc29YqS.jpg
---
Yeah, I think that would eliminate most of the griping about it.  The biggest issue, imo, is just that haulers are all 20k m3.  If you could lug around a couple ventures or procs, at much smaller m3 requirements, but similar hull costs, it would be significantly more palatable. 
---
Everyone is bitching about losing covert cynos for JFs, but it seems to be a lot of people who don't actually use JFs.  The only advantage it gave you was easy logistics to cyno jammed systems.  Everything else: extensive skill requirements for cyno alts, 50x-500x cost increases for cyno hulls (which would become magnets for being murdered), were far outweighed by this one upside.   People who thought jumping a JF into a "safe spot" in null or low-sec somewhere, routinely, would be a good idea, aren't really considering what game it is that we are playing here.
---
The whole controversy seems pretty stupid to me. Naturally, if CCP make the game harder they're going to lose some players. But those are the fair-weather players who can't appreciate the challenge that EVE is supposed to represent—the same kind of trash who always move to greener pastures during wartime. By being true to the spirit of EVE—the dark, dangerous universe where nobody is safe anywhere—CCP stanches the exodus of their loyal core audience.
---
Found it...
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/78032097/
---
Salty much?
---
yes,still wars have 50--100 bill destruction in fleet vs fleet simple battles ,and escalations with caps supers can go to 1000 bil+ .As we talk about isk/minerals destruction in 0.0 they can do it much faster/more effective than partisans ganking rorq/supers.So ccp should better boost this side of destruction in 0.0 than kicking players from 0.0 (eventualy from game) with blackout+cyno changes.
---
I agree. Idiots don't realize a delay of any kind is pointless. But if it makes them happy, I'm all for it.
---
Holy fuck you are dumb. Have a nice day dumbass.
---
&gt; Am I the naive one or just the one that isn't going to get hysteric over A.) Something I can't control and B.) Something I don't have the ability to check without making wild assumptions?
---
The fact that you think anyone is making "wild assumptions" says yes.
---
&gt; One example from the top of my head is "what if players are logging in frequently but spending their time doing low intensity and low time commitment activities like running 3-5 abyssals (roughly 1 hour worth of time spent logged in) daily before bed or work?" The game wouldn't be dying then,
---
Yes. This would be a dead game. If the only activity people engage in is abyssals, the value of running abyssals goes down until people stop running them and leave the game.
---
There is no way you can look at [2019 average players online(This is not PCU.)](http://jestertrek.com/eve/players/eve-players-2019.png) and think that whatever is going on is normal or okay. It's not just bad, it's not just getting worse, it's accelerating.
---
"Leave high-sec, move to null, have some fun" they said.
---
Hey there new bro! Just thought I'd take a second to try and give you some help. Eve can be a tough game, it's best to take it at your own pace. You mentioned local changes so it seems like you're talking about Null Security Space. This is considered somewhat of an "End Game" for many players, and can be a bit more difficult than other places. There's also High Security space, which might be a better fit for you if you're not comfortable playing without local. On the off chance you decide to try out PvP (I'm assuming you don't have much experience with this so far based on your posts) you can go to Low Security space which also has local! Hope this helps and you find a playstyle to suit your special needs for safety! o7 capsuleer, welcome to New Eden!
---
Big spenders!
---
Found what? Losing a ship? Hahahahaha
---
It's one of the easiest and safest activities in the game to bot since you cannot be reported, ganked, or otherwise messed with.
---
It's alright for now, I dislike the particulars with equipping my ship with rail guns, does not say how many slots are available per ship etc. Very annoying. Also, when I did upgrade skills I was able to upgrade a level 3 AND 4 of the same skill level at the same time. Weird. Only played one mission in the week and a half I've had it for, worked ok thus far aside from the issues I mentioned above.
---
I don't want to be the bearer of bad news, but with local people instantly docked and sat for an hour trying to get more numbers or logged off. Oh and we'd have everyone posting bot farms again crying for CCP to fix it.
---
reported
---
Mission running wouldn't be much worse than it already is, exploration is all about where you go. But again it boils down to not having people complain about aspects of the game they don't even care about and circles back to "reeeee blue doughnut op" which it really isn't. 
---
And gate camps exist everywhere already not always with bubbles but groups sitting on any high traffic area is a thing.
---
I'm comparing 3 mill ticks to ships worth less than 3 million and 18-25 million ticks to ships worth 75 mill up to 10-15 billion+ (that's not a typo) So does the risk really make the ticks worth it in null space? Not always, it can but that's again where using the tools already given helps. My point still stands people need high sec casual played don't need to be cheering for changes to null sec life without expecting changes to theirs as well.
---
&gt;t's just WoW Classic's release causing this
---
You forgot: college classes just started again, week after week, taking away some of that demographic that makes up less than 12% of the player base!
---
Perhaps, but each hound costs 60-80mil (200mil for polarised max dps) and does 500-750 DPS compared to 1B+ for 450-550DPS for a kiting T3.
---
Aw, thanks. I do enjoy helping new players find a spot in New Eden that matches their special needs. It would be cool to get recognition for that!
---
not my problem you were shit at hunting pre-blackout kiddo
---
Guy on the right is Merkelchen. He is always dressed very nice.
---
There are two kinds of players: the ones with imagination who see the universe as their oyster and play it as it lies, and the themeparkers with no imagination who demand predictable solo play, shortcuts (think skill injectors), hand-holding, safety, and nerfs. Retaining the former at the expense of the latter is always best for the health of the game.
---
You can call it a terrible example, but one became the dominant way in which to make isk in the game while the other withered away.
---
Thanks for posting this data Jestertrek. 
---
This data supports what a number of us have been saying. The majority of the logged in accounts lost were bot accounts. 
---
Since the Chinese migration to TQ there has been a huge uptick in botting, which can be attributed to that move. The fact that 66% of the downturn happened during AUTZ(Chinese TZ) speaks volumes. Blackout has made botting infinitely harder for all bu the most skilled programmers. It stands to reason that most of the majority of those that could not adapt to the change would drop their botting accounts. 
---
The remainder of accounts lost can be attributed to those who have unsubbed/refused to log in to protest the changes. I'm honestly not surprised that the NA crowd was the next largest group to go. Americans often look for the laziest way to do things. The fact they can no longer AFK rat/mine to make their ISK explains the sperginess seen on Reddit and the Eve-O forums. Makes it embarrassing to be an American honestly, among other things. 
---
Cheers to the Euro crowd for adapting and forging ahead on this one. You guys only lost a small number of subs comparatively.  Shows real character
---
TBH 90% of the food in Iceland is legitimately terrible. What CCP fed us was far and away better than most of the grub I've found there independently.
---
Just helping someone not to waste their money. Lying to people that the game isn't shit is really shitty of you. Now why don't you fuck off.
---
I have an alternative idea to the gates because I think it is an interesting idea to allow players to change the geography a bit.
---
Force them to be public use
---
Now the owner would obviously still have the option to turn them on or off so there is still a bit of control for the owners but that has an impact for both sides, same as a jammed system.
---
Side note: the ozone fuel cost would have to be removed otherwise price shenanigans could be used to make them effectively private again.
---
This makes a ton of sense to me. Ansiblex and WHs both need a nerf, but I don't think they should go away completely. Honestly I don't know why they got rid of jump fatigue with the ansiblex, bring back fatigue with the ansiblex and maybe even make it longer than normal jump fatigue (with the usual 90% reduction for industrial ships).   
---
Fixing WHs is a tougher cookie though and honestly dont know a way to Nerf them without ruining them. Maybe just nerfing covops in general is the cleaner answer.
---
He didnt have ratting permit so his ship was taken from him.
---
At best i had 10 months of 12 non-stop war(XIX) and now in Tenerifis i have more 10 months with 5 in war,so its not like you say bcos i play Eve in power blocs for 5 years and i know how much war i had,and you are just theory crafter vs  my real 5 years of power bloc play...so m8 u are wrong...

so sad. what makes it funnier is that CCP has more detailed stats than this yet they look so bored during the CSM summit......
---
It supports exactly what we've been saying. The majority of accounts lost are bots. A 66% downturn during Chinese timezone, knowing the prolific number of botting during that TZ, is a pretty good indicator of that. Spin some more please
---
Someone that builds them, and gets them to null market stands to make a lot.
---
Thank you, now I understand!
---
&gt;more frequently than they get welped 
---
Bombers are broken, true. The blackout is what makes them completely fucking broken.
---
Eh wh groups complaining about umbrellas is better salt extra salt and has added screeching and whining for your health
---
2322 new high sec bots logging in.
---
Ya bunch of carriers works too, good chance if it's a large stuka fleet you will lose a few bounces, but when your talking 150-200 fighters out it starts to overwhelm the logi/FC, can usually pick off a few of the carriers by turret ships blapping dromis, and heated dps on carrier that bounced.  But you have to be quick and boosh off before all the fighters are on top of you.
---
Wait wait, he now in elite pevepe f1 so be carefull when you talk with this elite boi
---
You guys really need to take a step back an get a fucking hold of yourselves. Its a meeting, not a pole dance. Some of the crap I am hearing through the grape vine on how players are expressing their grievances is downright unacceptable and a lot of individuals who are doing those things should be ashamed of themselves. Chill. Out.
---
I would recommend joining a medium-sized low or null-sec alliance. It is a hard balance to strike but if you find that sweet spot it really ends up working wonders.   
---
They can't be too small otherwise they wont have the resources to help you - look for groups with SRP, training classes, group activities.   
---
They also cant be too large otherwise you are just another number and you will get lost in the shuffle. - avoid the big 4 null blocks (Karma Fleet, Horde, Brave Newbies, Whatever the Chinese new bro group is). If they have a minimum fleet or kill requirements its probably not a good fit.   
---
Look for alliances in the  250-1000 player range. Feel free to DM me if you need help.

The fact that one exists and the other died out are for different unrelated reasons. Mostly that one was banned by CCP(input broadcasting). I am not addressing whether those activities are broken or whether something should be done about it, it should. Only that your example is wrong. I'm not sure I even disagree with your point, but when you're relying on an invalid example you're just a broken clock.
---
Input broadcasting scaled non-linearly, it allowed the addition of more accounts which would gain more than the simple sum of its parts without additional workload on the user. 
---
Mass Rorquals scale slightly worse than linearly, adding more adds work leading to a slowdown as you add more. (And those using input broadcasting to circumvent this should be banned.)
---
The premise of your argument is that the highsec incursion days did not overwhelmingly encourage mass multiboxing, and the rorqual days do. The fact is that the era you use an example of not needing to multibox was every bit as bad as it is today.
---
I’d accept this but would then hope they move them off citadel grids. But if I could follow people through them I guess it wouldn’t be so anti-content !
---
Damn, you're right. I don't use Python so I wasn't aware of that.
---
Oh fuck, nice catch lmao
---
Wew lad.
---
I CAN'T BE BOTHERED TO ADAPT PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME ADAPT I WOULD RATHER DIE
---
You're all over the place. This just reads of like buzzwords. Should it be relatively safe to rat in a super or not? It was never 100% safe in the "old days" zkill shows that to be an immediate falsehood. It's a copout to say "you're call" should ratting in supers be a viable possibility for nullsec ratters?
---
The skill injector, PvP noob nonsense is just icing on the cake. I was able to fly a super before skill injectors were even a thing and besides that, knowing how to PvP in a PvP ship has little to no bearing on how to PvE in a PvE ship. So you've made assumptions just based on whatever. It reeks of no true Scotsman. A real PvPer would never rat in a super or something or would what... eat the loss? I'm unsure what a real PvPer would do differently than a "noob"?
---
What's odd is you whole paragraph basically says "Of course you'll still be able to print isk at will with no risk because umbrella" But also say "yea rat in a BS that is going to die constantly but make terrible isk but is also more than highsec..... somehow"
---
I was just confirming what you said. :)
---
LOL, no.
---
How often did you go out after dinner?
---
Haha
---
Usually 7 days. Flight upgrade + food + booze. Easily spend $100 a day on food plus drinks.
---
Ceptors lost their nullified buff?
---
Yeah. 
---
I live there and i’m fucked because i took a break and also don’t have the time, and sense, to resupply my route right now.
---
It will take me hours to set things up again and seed enough T1’s at my stations before i can start to “play” again. 
---
Meh. I don’t feel like it right now. Maybe in a few weeks or so.
---
You're acting like they don't matter but they do. We can make a direct correlation from PCU and DAU to the shrinking playerbase. We can look at the steep drops and see that things aren't going well.
---
We also know from CCP's past history that they're often stupidly stubborn when they think they have a good idea even if evidence points otherwise.
---
What we expect is for your like to take a look at the data here - "https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/d1qjmj/updated_numbers_what_effect_is_the_blackout/ezpoili/" and think for even one second that maybe, just *maybe* everything isn't just fine and that *maybe* these changes have been detrimental to the playercount and game as a whole.
---
That's what these threads seek to accomplish.
---
The blackout crowd has been so fucking adamant for weeks that these have been good changes and the game is more lively than ever but so far not a single thread of quantifiable data has shown otherwise.
---
Anyways, lmao blackout
---
Imagine getting dunked on by a bunch of miners
---
Agree, crystal also could be useful :D
---
Oh you mean login traps... cloaky afk campers eventually dropping on you? Much better. Hahaha. If you were such a great hunter before the blackout, you should be amazing elite now.
---
What I need to know is who's the man with that magnificent beard?
---
When I started in ns I was flying shit in a fucking cigar out of all things. Jf's etc were a luxury. I see nothing wrong with the game becoming like this or at least heading more in such a direction. It will help out with all the other proliferation shit while at it too.
---
Sigh. No it should not be safe to rat in a super. Umbrellas will still be able to provide support but now it will require effort as opposed to just having a cyno on your carrier and lighting it when a stiletto lands 500km off you. 
---
A super can farm anoms perfectly well in a PvP fit. In fact bs can farm them also in a PvP fit. If you are dying all the time you are doing it wrong.
---
These aren’t buzzwords they are just hard for someone who clearly doesn’t understand PvP mechanics to grasp the basic concept that nullsec should be dangerous and if you are capable you will survive. If you are not high sec is safer.
---
No. The blackout makes a STEALTH bomber what it should be.
---
If you're think of the same story I know, the guy was not technically in a Jove system its just their position on the universe map was in a Jove system. They started in some standard system (like something in Vale of the Silent, I don't recall where exactly) and then used some now defunct method to keep flying out of the system. As far as the servers were concerned they never left their starting system, they were just some 10 light years (or whatever) away from the star.
---
About as legit as afk cloaky fags whether you like that or not
---
The bots haven’t quit and you’re mentally retarded if you think otherwise
---
Developers are entitled to do whatever they want to their games. Customers are entitled to complain about it if they don't like the changes to the service and ultimately stop paying for that service.
---
Just the combat ceptors. Fleet ceptors were not changed.
---
Naw man. With that high pitch femme voice I expected something different.
---
That's an disingenuous - while the drakes may be toasters, it's the supers that let them get the job done.
---
Totally agree 100%, the reddit community needs to chill with the constant negativity.
---
Thanks. I’ve been slowly building my desktop so I could play again.
---
Needlecasting and Stacks in Altered Carbon eerily remind me of the in-lore explanation for capsuleer consciousness transfers. (Good show btw)

IIRC, capsules send your brain-scans at the time of death through the fluid-router network which is connected by quantum entanglement. This sends you right into your death-clone at the time of death.

Hilmar's only in charge for another month following the sale, then the new owner gets full control. Do you really think a company as obsessed with micro-transactions and increasing revenue as Pearl Abyss is will sit there and watch him tank the player count and drive out paying accounts?
---
Confirming, you confirming what he said
---
you have an interesting choice of username...
---
Can confirm.
---
I actually endorse this idea.
---
That argument is hollow considering that by your own logic, if you argue for keeping the status quo, it in turn is you who "forces" other players into a specific playstyle.
---
Any time anybody uses the term "wake up" who isn't Zach de la Rocha you know they're just trying to lie to you.

Cut him to make sure the shit memes don't go further
---
This video contains music too! Think you maybe onto something.
---
And thats a reasonable stance, I still don't agree but I see where you are coming.  But the issue being discussed was some rushing to whore on a kill to make their number go up, which is what I absolutely do not understand.

I cannot remember the last time we used supers when we were doing sov stuff, not even as cover. It's just subcaps against subcaps.        
---
Of course, having supers helps to protect your space and especially any Sotiyos.
---
shhhh, don't them that, they still haven't figured out the bots are just rerolling a new account the second they got banned because you can alpha bot highsec.

I clean public toilets, just as a hobby, and we have ideas all over the walls and windows too.

For all the potential these imagines have as a meme format, almost all of them have been bad so far.

I use it to bring a fleet of hulk alts across the region to go moon mining. Works like a charm to haul the hulks in the bay, jump to beacon, activate vat, then just pod the alts home when done.
---
Jesus Christ you guys have literally devolved to Qanon levels of self validation for your arguments.

Wow, I knew Eve's player base was older but I didn't quite realise how much older.

Oh come on, you can't honestly believe the nice 2005 level player count is "all bots".

People aren't happy. I'd say look at the forums, but you fuckwits don't seem to take the opinion of anyone there seriously, even if it matters just as much as yours

My assumptions about vily being retarded may be correct afterall
---
That's a Texas sized 10-4, buddy.
---
Man such an original and humorous post! Thanks for adding to the discussion - you are truly a genius of our time.
---
&gt;I don't think it's a trivial qualifier, since it introduces a dimension of skill into the achievement.
---
A dimension of just flying ahead with an alt to avoid gate camps so that you never enter a system at a bad time.  There's no way your luck is going to hold for 7k+ systems - you have to be using eyes.
---
The last MER report shows decreases in ships destroyed in regular space, mining, ratting, building and ships destroyed in abyssal space. And the player count currently shows a 10K player dip at all peak times, all player activity has fallen off a cliff.
---
You can petition CCP to remove these. I've had to do so before.
---
I think you're a bit of an idiot. See - now we can be friends. I don't haul things for BRAVE or whoever you aren't ticker trolling, but whomever does your hauling is gonna have the same issues I'm gonna have. As will every other JFer in the game.
---
Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm not. But if you think that JFs and moving ships / fittings don't have an impact on content - you are a bit of a mongo.

Love this guys videos

They'd set their own house on fire to be right.

They should make anything jumping to indy cynos have FULL fatigue, maybe even double fatigue. Just to make sure people aren't abusing it to move other stuff around via blops bridge.

it's possible to store more than 2147483647 in an integer regardless of architecture my dude

Iam just writing about reality. bots are not affected but real players with alts are hit hard.  
---
renting a moon is same boring way as mining moon with tons of rewarps with rorq and so...  
---
60m/hr is usual ratting reward for hiskill ishtar, because as semiafk ratter you are flying hubs, because havens+ has problem with drone autoaggro and as well with capital spawn.
---
Thanks for the reply, Dunk. I'm not saying that you need to be a game designer, necessarily, but you're certainly a very interested game player. You clearly have strong thoughts about changes that you have not liked, so it would make some sense that you would also have some thoughts about what you would like to see change positively in the game, too.
---
I posed the question as a way of asking if important space-people, such as yourself, are open to changes that reduce isk and mineral faucets in null and increase risk to certain types of previously low-risk farming, and its just the DESIGN of Blackout that you or your members do not like, or if you disagree with the IDEA of nerfing isk and mineral faucets and raising risk levels to PVE ships in null in general. The nerfs to Rorq yields and PANIC mechanic and the NSA change, the apparent outcomes of prior CSM's comments about the safety of Rorq mining and carrier ratting, didn't appear to materially impact either isk or material generation. Blackout unquestionably did. So, I'd be curious as to your personal (or Legacy's general) position on the matter; I suppose both could be relevant in your CSM representation.
---
I also appreciate that big orgs like Brave have lots of data. If you can share, how granular is that data? Has activity in, say, Incredible. (which has been really active in Scalding Pass, per last week's TIS) dropped in proportion to the Brave Collective generally, or have the Blackout changes had a bigger impact on other playstyles within Brave? Along those lines, does your data separate out the impact of random smaller roaming groups of 10-20 blopsers that catch Myrms and Domis in the Blackout vs., say, the increased presence of Imperium bomber fleets, Snuff dread bombs, and Marshy camping in Impass? All of those appear to be pretty real deterrents to heavy-asset-driving farming within Brave's space, all are relatively new, and all would seem likely to have been a rather inconvenient pain in the ass regardless of Blackout.
---
Next they need to make it so you can't light a cyno within 500km of a structure.
---
Sounds just about perfect.
---
Yeah, gl with that. I’d be pretty impressed by an abyss bot that can reliably pull in more isk\hour than other forms of ratting. Abyss isn’t just target, shoot, gain bounty, repeat,
---
https://zkillboard.com/character/1983190090/stats/ Yeah, you sure seem to know how to find content.
---
I’m right on this one
---
What's your ratting super fit if I may as? I would like to work on my pvp super ratting skills. I'm curious how yours is fit to fend off hostiles. Also how do you plan on dealing with hotdrops? Will you have a secondary account with a cloaked cyno or just hope your fleet is around?
---
Thanks for saying it guys, though it won't change most likely. But the constant whining/CCP bashing has made this sub nearly unreadable. Which is to bad since I love the kill/battle stories some players post.
---
Most of us just think its hilarious to watch day after day these threads popping up.
---
urgh his voice
---
I like them but I dont see CCP ever getting around to these types of ideas.
---
the blue loot referred just to t2 rigs; im well aware that t2 modules and ships use components which u make from reaction products, as well as other things like PI products etc. like i said, i make them.. its not that hard to understand how it works..
---
It's not an argument amigo. It is reddit right now. All sides.
---
That'd be awesome
---
The ripple effect happens 6-12 months from an event, even earnings reports referenced crypto as being a major contributor to the slow down.
---
Or, you know, drive away a large amount of the playerbase... But who needs players lmao
---
When I first came back I didn't know it existed and tried to sneak out of -1.0 in my hauler. Oops, kaboom,, welcome back :)      
---
But yes I agree.
---
Good for them!
---
Couldnt they swap it with a 64bit int now ?
---
Blue loot is not T2 salvage. Blue loot is a commodity that you sell to NPC buy orders.
---
So you agree with me my dude, the client  being 64bit now doesn't mean shit
---
Ok, thanks I did not know that SC was involved at all.
---
I was not challenging your point, mate. Merely commenting on your choice of words.
---
Then why did you assert a bunch of things, like no scouting, no interdiction nullification, ect?
---
Fill every vertical with a goonscam.
---
Or just select 'Download Everything' in the launcher...
---
i dont have patience for condescension.
---
you assumed i was an f1 monkey in goons/horde/brave/test and that i knew nothing of industry/logistics. you we're wrong on both counts.
---
you still havent defended your position and have deflected multiple times.  I know im new, its doesnt invalidate my perspective on the change. instead of trying to attack my credibility, defend your arguments.
---
Your first sentence is spot on.
---
I'm really curious about wtf happened to the average nullsec population and their mentality while i was away from the game for a few years. I come back to see the kind of complaints we usually hear from pure 100% hisec players who after years of playing the game in a very limited manner, either by accident or by greed ended up taking a shortcut through Tama in an untanked hauler with all their life's assets on board and then start going over how "it should not be possible to destroy all my in-game efforts in one fell swoop", completely disregarding their own part in the debacle.
---
The fact that one of the big groups mostly twisting panties and making daily posts about the changes is well known for ganking hiseccers and noobs for fun and profit makes it even funnier. Well, if you do it it to people on the somewhat safe and newbie friendly zone, don't get upset if the game starts catering to others doing it to you in the intentionally lawless, PvP centric part of the map. But let's not single the Goons out, because they are not the only ones making a fuss about this, just the loudest.
---
So, is it a cultural issue? Is it because of recruiting anyone with a pulse to boost numbers, so the skill pool is piss poor in general? Is it because of indoctrinating newbros into a specific playstyle from the get go, so they end up with zero adaptability outside of a very specific playstyle that reinforces a lot of hand-holding early on, minimal personal skill and agency and an inability to make their own fun in a sandbox game?
---
I'm really perplexed sometimes, because it's like i've come back to a different EvE in a parallel universe, where hisec and null mentalities are the opposites of what they traditionally where.
---
A place where null is full of crybabies who refuse to adapt (pretty important distinction here, it's not like they can't with all their accumulated resources, it's that they refuse), while month old newbros with much bigger balls make enough to plex their accounts by running courier contracts through Niarja and Uedama in tech1 haulers, then graduate into solo blockade runner smuggling, making a killing by hauling underpriced stuff from NPC null to Jita, funding their plex and their pvp ships in the process.
---
It's quite funny to be honest.
---
lol, as if you'd get a constructive discussion here
---
I am surprised that others did not massive downvoted you.
---
People dont like who tell them the thruth.
---
Better tell me they're far less. Cuz that's the truth.
---
Wake up sheeple, hilmar is turning the ~~frogs~~ cynos gay!
---
Yeah, lets make even bigger blobs.
---
fuckin bullshit
---
Isn't healthy post blackout either, if anything, it's worse.
---
I (mis?)read one of the original posts about it and had in my mind that the pilot was entirely solo.
---
How am I supposed to rat and mine if I don't know when they're within 3j? This doesn't help at all
---
One can hope
---
&gt;Constructive discussion...
---
You must be new here...
---
Responds with "Yeah go fuck yourself" -- upset for condescension.
---
You are a 3 month character. You DON'T know anything about large scale industry or logistics. I defended my arguments in my original post. Go read that. Bring up a specific point, then we can talk.
---
I actually don't mind the citadel grid issue as much mostly because the old system someone could man the POS and be a threat as well.
---
The mothership would FUCK the server right up if they got into any type of major engagement. Less units on field is needed, not more. Perhaps have it launch Super fighters as an analogue to destroyers, as our currents fighters are to frigates. Terrible tracking, extreme dps, make them anti-cap monsters but useless against subcaps. Have them be one superfighter per launch tube as opposed to multiple to help with server lag. It doesnt continue the meta of supers destroying subcap fleets and allows for more options in larger scale engagements.
---
I think you accidentally discovered time travel.
---
Ah got it. I only recall because he was on a podcast talking about it and said Sig Cartel (of which he's a member) helped find the last of the WH systems, and they made an rp-type event out of it without ever actually telling the members why they needed to ping for certain systems. Pretty cool imo
---
Considering that you seem to disagree with the comment you replied to it absolutely is an argument, even if it is not a particularly good one :)
---
Why don’t you just do a it load with industrials to that station?
---
It wasn't an argument, rather a somewhat caustic and snarky response. But it wasn't disagreeing or agreeing.
---
Yeah, mad respect for this.  Now do it in an Orca, no scouts.
---
*Edit.  I was kidding*
---
THE VNI DID NOT GET NERFED, JUST REASSIGNED TO A DIFFERENT ROLE
---
How long have you been playing eve op?
---
And remember, when someone disagrees with you in a civil tone that doesn't justify you screeching at him in the usual manner, takes the time to type a small essay to get his points across in a easy to understand way and you find yourself having to form a coherent counter-argument, you can just downvote to hide his post instead and stop the disruption to your preferred narrative.
---
Man some of you guys are lazy as hell, no wonder you cry that much about the recent changes :)
---
Its easy for retards who have never done anything but get fed content in game talk about how people should put more effort into eve.
---
So I hate to be pedantic, but couldn’t I just throw up a nullified yacht and coast around and do this relatively quickly and easily in totally risk free?
---
bring back local with a delay of 23 hours then.
---
uhoh, ya found me.. make sure not to jf anything for me in ur courier contracts for pushX baby boy
---
I am for chaos and change. That was part of my campaign. 
---
However, I want things that add to the game and create new options, rather than reducing them.  Changing cynos usage could be a lot of fun with a wider range of choices and options.  Changing local in way to create new goals and variable 'terrain' in space, would be awesome.  With more time &amp; effort, we might have seen some amazing things.  Unfortunately, we are seeing fairly simplistic changes that demotivate a significant amount of players.
---
I can only speak to non-CCP data, that from Brave &amp; Legacy.  It's not detailed down to specific ship types or fleets.   It measures activity several ways and all of them are on downward trends.
---
Perfect scouting and timing. The inhibs finished onlining only a few seconds before the Titan exited warp, and interdictors were waiting at the exact range he warped at.
---
We already have that anti super anti structure role fulfilled by regular heavy drones with their Torpedoes. I guess this idea needs more theory crafting.
---
You're posting should be good
---
shhh, tell daddy where the bad man hilmar touched you...  
---
write a poem about how first they came for the jump freighter pilots, next they came for me, and tomorrow they come for you, or some equally retarded shit
---
The sequence will be: board cyno from rorqual, light cyno while invincible from panic, 200k ehp falcon bridges in and lights regular cyno, umbrella comes in
---
I like how half then comments are HK propaganda. "oh I had only good experiences with hk, do go throw your isk at this shitty scammer Corp"
---
Stackable MWDs to achieve warp speed back in the day
---
Well it is if you overgear it.
---
A gila with navy drones in Tier 2/3 abyss is pretty much unkillable and fairly cheap. Not even the neut Leshaks are a threat.
---
blackout doesnt made nullsec harder.  
---
Im at a point i get bored about this blobs fleets. I enjoyed pvp and done mainly pvp.  
---
In my opinion they could do the same effect with a little more develop effort.  
---
1. no longer allow caps to enter combat sites.  
---
2. remove boson dd from the game  
---
3. bring back boost rorqual,  allow rorqual only to use mining drones. "mining rorqauls are a self made problem"  
---
4. bring back limited industry slots on citadels  
---
at the moment i save my stuff and then i take at least a 6 month break.   
---
for all the trolls on reddit, im not salty or something else.
---
Stop replying before you make an even bigger idiot out of yourself.
---
Hahah i loved how hyped this guy was
---
Till your drones get aggro and get their face murdered off. That was true 6 months ago, not now.
---
there are legitimate reasons to download the whole game at once, like people who live in rrural areas with terrible internet who download it when theyre somehwere with better network
---
Only one way to find out. Get started.
---
I HAVE BEEN PLAYING THIS GAME FOR ONLY A WEEK AND I HAVE NO FCKIN IDEA WHAT IS GOING ON HERE REEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Also the leadership frigate doesn't seem to actually DO anything, especially not regarding its apparent t3 status, it is very, very niche (like, Monitor or Marshal level niche), and t3 ships are designed to be extremely adaptive and good for multiple different tasks. 
---
If I had to counter offer an Idea for a t3 frigate, combine the concepts with our current t3 ship choices. You have subsystems, and modes. What if you could essentially equip 2 different configurations (covert, assault, logi, defensive, etc) like subsystems and could swap them with some type of cooldown. Since they are smaller ships you have less choices compared to the t3d, but you get to pick precisely the things you'd like to be effective at before undocking. 
---
And given the current bomber supremacy, having an even better bomber sounds pretty insane.
---
What if this was a game with black ops options and having names listed in a little window when you entered a solar system made absolutely no sense.
---
Lol... Bet you have quite the black book of phone numbers to "call for a good time"
---
Nah, I'll just let you keep posting. You'r bringing enough of the retarded shit to this thread.
---
Some of you see this as CCP looking like they don't care, but to my eyes, they appear to be having a "well, *shit*" moment. Is anyone else getting that vibe or am I the only one?
---
Yeah heavy fighters fill that role, but what if they were even more of a glass cannon? Big ass damage but more easily defanged. Its not a great idea, but I dont think any t2 super is a good idea.
---
You guys are talking past each other.
---
However, you, being only 3 months into an Eve career, cannot fathom the logistics it takes to supply an Alliance of thousands of pilots.  You are not fully aware of shit.
---
So to show them that the changes are killing our game we kill their game?...
---
I'm down for it, actually.

I know the feeling, buddy. Here's hoping for another decade+ where we can make our marks in New Eden!

Yes there is, once CCP is committed to an idea, the result could literally be -50% of active subscribers, and they wont change a thing about it.
---
You could make a case study about that company wrt institutional momentum and sunk cost fallacies.
---
Now combine that attitude with Hilmar's newfound " shoot from the hip first, ask questions never" nu-ccp model, and boy howdy do we have a recipe for success.

It's a sign of the times.  With fewer players logging in that means a decreased risked.  Expect to see this feat duplicated as the player count declines.

I've actually been playing it over the weekend. I like what I see so far. Some of the mechanics are "preset", like orbiting a target when you mine or attack, can't be changed (as far as I can tell). And of course just like CCP would have it, no tutorial worth a dang. Just drops you in a ship and says "welcome to New Eden MF. Get rekt."
---
They get annihilated in moments when they get instantly webbed and target by the whole room. Drones in abyss nowadays is a constant dance of recall\relaunch leading to many Gila’s failing from timeout.
---
Like I said I’d be highly impressed if someone came up with a reliable abyss bot that isn’t doing like T1s in a 7b ship.

The former stops applying when you sell the company to a third party.

That's like saying that the guy making your burger at McDonalds is entitled to make it however he wants, and that your only option is to stop eating there if you don't like it.
---
...okay, it's not EXACTLY the same, given that developing a game is considerably more complex, but you get the general idea. In both cases, the employee's job is to design the product with owners' best interests in mind - you make the burger the way you were trained and you design the game to maximize its profitability.
---
The devs' job now is to maximize PA's profits, not entertain themselves, and they can and should be held responsible for EVE's popularity and profitability. Of course, it's PA they're responsible to, not us, but that doesn't mean our opinions are irrelevant (though they ARE often shortsighted and misguided).
---
Maurauders have a 1 minute bastion and you sit with mjd on. They’re not actually that tied to a site. Don’t run with open connections, watch incomings. 1 minute MAXIMUM of being tied to a site when a new sig spawns isn’t actually that bad. That being said, the insurance isn’t great and it does take you a while to pay back the ship. You’re better off tri boxing snakes for 600m/hr same risk if you have 3 accs
---
A few public bots are avail if you know where to look.. And yes it is already being botted. I have had one running from around 8 weeks after Abys came out. So far undetected...

Any way for me to get in on that? Or is it still a weird closed beta for certain regions? If I could, somehow, magically, be in a different region, could I sign up to get an invite still?
---
Overall ship deaths are down outside of null, so is market activity for things multiboxers don't typically consume. Not to mention discord activity across the board is down, eve-o forum activity and r/eve activity is down (well, r/eve is neutral and not growing, which is a first for this time of year) This isn't really that hard of a concept. It could be blackout, it could just be the planets aligning. That's not for me to decide. 
---
I know it sucks to accept that your game of choice could actually be dying and not run with the #death2krabs narrative and all , but the writing is on the wall. Believe me I can relate to the frustration. This game has consumed far too much of my life and I don't want it to outright die.  But the fact of the matter is that's too big of a drop, too quickly. 
---
If you want to assume it's all multiboxers, provide data for this. Burden of proof would be on you. (That would still be players, by the way). All I know is logins are massively down and a lot of key indicators for activity across most fields are way down. You're free to claim it's just people cancelling alts (which is still awful for the game), but provide some evidence.
---
he right for goons because no one in Eve can handle their 2000+titan but for FRT x TEST it's different most fights happen in subcap and Legacy are "just" 2,5 more than WinterCo in their prime less in Chiness TZ
---
that's why this war is far longer than the north one, but Test aren't impacted by this war they still farm without any problem, thats different for WC even if they can farm in the drone region, soo there still a prolifération because none of them gonna escalate a supercap fight and they still farm enough, if you want anything else to happen ask for a gamedesign change, this one is bad

this is nothing new from CCP
---
True.  When I joined FW with some alts, acting noob, I’ve been well received by veterans there, and they did give me a tutorial on how to d-scan (even though I already knew that stuff by then - I was remembering what it’s like to be a new player).  So yeah, many thanks to all you guys and girls for the good job you’re doing helping newcomers out there !
---
Thing is, when I started with my main in early 2017, I was utterly intimidated by PvP, and thanks to EVE’s reputation, I suspected everyone hailing me of being a scammer.  I never used d-scan even long after CODE tried to kill my first Venture, leaving me with no clue about wtf just happened and why all the hate toward a new player trying to build his first cruiser.  I ran all the tutorials, did all the career agents, and even started with level 1&amp;2 security missions.  In some of those, they mention you need to have large collidable structures/objects on your overview to see the stuff you are asked to blow as the objective.  So I had started playing with my overview.  But nothing asking me to experiment with d-scan.  Until space friends.
---
Nowadays there are diamond rats and roaming triglavians in addition to CODE that will blow your sorry ass if you’re a rookie.  That can be a frustrating experience, especially if you don’t understand what happened.  That can make players having a taste of the game decide that fuck it, this game is just stupid.  I’m well aware that a generic tutorial will not replace the teachings of a veteran, but in some cases it might just be the first step in hooking a new EVE addict.
---
So you want interceptors to be entirely unkillable?
---
just don't use it
---
Burners are the major income source for several people i know. Corp pullers and decent social skills and they can run burners near-nonstop making decent moneyl

77 botters.
---
Combat capabilities shouldn't be the sole determination of whether or not a specific activity should have risk. I don't think anyone would be okay with freighters getting covert Ops cloaking devices, instant align, and Warp interdiction nullification. It is definitely possible to imbalance something, even if it cannot fight.
---
Maybe this is a way for CCP to encourage smaller blobs... the bigger the blob, the more logistics needed.
---
I’ll give you three fiddy
---
Because more people died in august? Your guess is as good as mine. The only empircal evidence we have is the the login numbers plummeting and several other key indicators. 
---
It's entirely possible this change causes more player deaths in the short term in exchange for damaging the population of the game. But that's not an argument I'm even talking about so I'm not sure what your point is.
---
Sometimes they're more like CCCP.  "You're having fun? Take 'em away, boys!"
---
I've never lost a drone in a T2 while learning how to Abyss. I picked Navy Hammerheads for their bonus durability and they tank entire rooms.

---
I mean it was 2.5 hours for no r/eve :P
---
Pretty interesting. What i get from your post is that
---
1. The majority of people not logging in are from a timezone that was bot-heavy, which if accurate is good.
---
2. We've had similarly low numbers (but not that low) in the past as well, which is bad in general and not only in relation to the current changes. So there must also be things besides blackout and cyno changes that make people leave the game (eg, see next point). I'm not entirely sure about which expansion was released on which year, but it seems some of the similarly low numbers are roughly from a time when capital ships and rorqs got buffed and citadels/asset safety were introduced.
---
3. People don't really fight any meaningful wars anymore, which further kills activity because you can only farm so much before it becomes meaningless. Congrats, you now have one of each ship in the game and the skills to fly them all through injectors so...what then? For example, i can easily make 200-400mil per day station trading currently. This is more than enough to plex my 2 accounts and still have plenty leftover isk for a bunch of pvp ships to whelp regularly. But i have nothing interesting to spend it on, because nullsec nowadays is boring.
---
I'd wager a bet that because the current mechanics are too safe and make losing not punishing enough, winning is not important either (and that's discounting the already accumulated massive assets during the past few years, which would easily replace losses for quite some time even if stuff was destroyed on a reasonable scale).
---
Another point of note is overabundance of resources. Anomalies make it easy to support huge alliances with only a few regions held, and they work the opposite you would expect them to...the more you farm a region, the better bonuses you get through the ADMs and such.
---
Finally, it seems like there is no place on the strategic pvp meta for anything smaller than capitals (except very specific hard counters to them, like bomber fleets). This further limits player choice and forces people down a very narrow path that requires a lot of investment, which in turn results in a lot more risk aversion through the desire to protect that investment. And that's how we end up with the current turtling meta.
---
So, the pvp centric players either leave the game (and that's been happening for a decade), or go to other playstyles (eg, migrating from null blocs to wormhole corps, or roaming npc null groups), leaving null with the asset-accumulation minded players and a minuscule core of the really hardcore guys who will stay loyal to their alliance to the end, FC daily and manage everything for the masses. Which makes it really difficult to balance things out, because in doing so you alienate an entire part of the player base, since other playstyles seem to be heavily under-represented in null currently.
---
It's a can of worms for sure, but i'm glad CCP is taking a risk and trying to shake it up. I don't agree 100% with the way they are doing things, but i definitely prefer it to them doing nothing.
---
Still, what we get are more like band-aid changes. What they really need to do is rebalance caps and add sov-related tasks designed primarily around subcaps to give people a reason to undock in smaller ships, and rework citadels and asset safety. Maybe then we'd see more reasons to fight, more diverse fleet compositions and more player engagement.
---
From what that White board it looks like they're deciding who has to be a tour guide.
---
They tended to think at least a little harder, not that it necessarily made sense in the end.
---
In a T3+ post Gila drone HP nerf and post May drone aggro changed? I’d love to see it.
---
Don't worry, the blackout should be over within a month or so - Hilmar has to have realized by now that he overestimated the duration of the activity spike it would cause and implemented it too early, allowing the inevitable negative long-term effects to start before his bonus was paid out.
---
I'm sure he's realized by now that he can end the blackout to cause at least a temporary resurge in player count and activity, as some of the people who left resub and flock back to the game. However, he's trying not to repeat his previous mistake by ending it TOO early - he doesn't want subs cancelled in response to the end of the blackout to expire before he gets his money.
---
-Arty didn't used to do 4x the alpha of other weapons

Yeah, Vily looks a bit down in that pic.

Yea, right after the Star Trek crossover

Must be why the Badger suddenly became more expensive than the Tayra. And I had to look around to get a cheap Nereus and Miasmos. I don't do jump logistics :-/

Isn't that what we had? You cloaked, but hey... I know you're here and so did everyone since you came into null 10 jumps ago.

I think a system that just pushes numbered data, nothing more, is the middle ground here.

I think its obvious here that i'm not referring to individual developers but to CCP as a whole. McDonalds is entitled to make its hamburgers however it pleases (as long as they aren't hurting people).

I only ever did a handful of sites in it to get the hang of using fighters. I imagine an unfit one wouldn’t have a problem seeing as my shields never got touched. I solo dropped on carriers so I was fit to kill and bounce.

I guess if you could jump it wouldn’t be so bad as you could bail when the keepstar spools up its domesday. But imo it would be better if they had to be in game that they were on their own grid so you could camp them without issue. Content

none of those changes had nearly the effect of quadrupling the EHP of freighters, not even close.
---
I've never heard or seen anything to suggest that this was done 100% scout free, or any of the other claims that someone made. I honestly don't think it matters either way
---
CCP are a massive pile of spunktrumpets right now. They said that JF's would jump to Covert Cynos - so after grumbling about the short notice, I inject my alts with Cyno 5 and now they change to industrial cynos further on. GG CCP - really putting thought into these things and not doing a knee jerk reaction at all.

Pretty much what I feel like they look like every time a good suggestion comes up that isn't related to fuck like a quarter of the playerbase or more
---
&gt; So come in ships other than cloaky nullified cowardfits. You can't fly  ships designed to avoid a fight then bitch about not getting fights. 
---
Sure you can. It's called "hunting" and it's probably the most popular activity in EVE, in addition to being the CCP-approved way of playing the game. It consists of ganking miners and ratters, running or hiding from everything that can fight back, and mindlessly spamming posts/comments about "stagnation" and "(super)capital proliferation" on reddit whenever you can't find enough krabs to gank.
---
Whether you can do it without being a hypocrite and a moron is another matter entirely.
---
Try it before you assume, you would need godlike south korean sc2 micro to multibox more than 2, and even 2 is really, really pushing it.
---
So... previously the narrative was that bots ran 23/7. Now, because the steepest decline is in RU/CH TZ... bots only run 8 hours a day and they must all be Chinese bots? How does that logic fit a decade of saying bots were 23/7... Like, :JackieChanWhatFace:
---
Frat x test is one step behind of how wormholers prearrange fights for content.
---
It does not matter goons/not goons - war mechanics in EVE is boring for everyone ,and telling your players : hey we gonna go to war and we gonna etnoz/shoot fortizars/astra next 1 year to clear 1 region " wtf man,noone wants that shit so noone is trying to make war,if we can eventually have changes where war is fun in 0.0 then there will be major war and boost of players online,if we will get "new cyno recon alts shit" changes then it will not...simple...and ccp just keep changing everything except what 0.0 players is telling them.We need how many years to get back our fatigue to normal,like 5 years we where stuck in red 30 days fatigue timers? Is it so hard to see after 3 months of change that they made bad change?
---
Where are people getting these pics
---
Dealing with multiple clients should make the code slightly more complicated to not get detected, but afaik CCP doesn't have anything inplace to detect even the most basic of botting.
---
Yeah surely, the more and more annoying they make eve to play, the more players will flood in, its BULLETPROOF.
---
I thought numbers were down because it was summer and would go up when it was over. But.. now school started so numbers are down. (what's the narrative this week?)
---
The smallest modicum of piloting means they can't be sniped off. Go use the new pyfa graphing feature to see how little dps is applied to interceptors that do anything but approach directly at a target.
---
Frankly I am not sure whether we should celebrate such potentially pathological behavior. But ok..
---
If hostiles put in slightly more effort they could do this to dozens of caps per day. Goons are so fucking stupid. It's amazing how much smarter other alliance ratters are vs the subhuman trash I listen to on theta
---
Skill points raise effort lowers? Engagement? Economy? He's covering up alot of it, and some context is needed. I'm sure it was a groundbreaking revelation from how giddy and excited the CSM were.
---
All gaming communities are bags of salt sprinkled with cheeto dust.
---
No they can't. They can't go into novices and they get shit on by everything in the smalls. They can't tackle non flashy targets on gates or stations and aren't good anti tackle either.
---
That's fine, but said people who stop paying for that service don't move on, most continue to whinge on the sidelines - and being "passionate about the game" doesn't cut it.
---
So, here is some tinfoil. CCP has on average banned.. what, 1k a month? All of a sudden, first time in 15 years when it just happens to match a massive player drop they banned 5k bots. Bots that would literally reroll within 48 hours anyway, but yea.. that's where the drop is.
---
I am probably stretching this, but doesnt this somehow amount to potential doxxing, since these pictures make these people identifiable?
---
They consider any feedback about the same as I consider the feedback from my 11 and 13 year old. Yeah... no.

"it's just a game, why you heff to b mad?"

Maybe it comes with a nerf to the way stuka fleets operate. I never said these ships would single handedly make the game better.

didnt look at the picture but u/Fuzzmeister_ probably

The original claim in this thread is that "99% of changes" are in favour of wormholers. I'm looking at the patch notes and the main focus in June and August has been: war dec mechanics change; VNI nerf; tutorial rework; Triglavian invasion. None of those have anything to do with wormholes so unless @ericader can find 297 other changes which favour wormholers, that claim is incorrect. The last change apart from blackout with a direct effect on J spacers is the Gila nerf in April (which is a negative effect, obviously).
---
As for nullsec buffs, I already mentioned the three major ones (excavators, Upwell structures and instant anomaly respawn). FLEX structures (particularly Ansiblex) is another huge buff to the blob. So is the signature browser across multiple systems.

#LOOKS LIKE CHAOS TO ME
---
To be fair, mass injected Rorqual alts IS a problem and something probably SHOULD be done about it.
---
A REASONABLE solution would be to remove or limit the ability of skill injectors to be used on skills that enable PVE activities that scale linearly with the number of characters used and are easy to multibox, such as mining, PI, research, and manufacturing.
---
You're 100% correct that forcing people back to hisec is NOT a good solution. CCP ignored the problem for too long, presumably letting it slide because skill extractor sales were good for them in the short term, and now they think they can fix everything by simply swinging a sledgehammer at it. Sure, doing so might screw over a lot of players and cause many of them to quit, but those players don't matter anyways because they weren't playing the CCP-approved way.
---
The release notes don't seem to mention if the industrial cyno behaves like the covert cyno or regular cyno, or if it has a new type of behavior (duration and "gank the throwaway ship" symbol).
---
If the industrial cyno beacon doesn't appear in system, at least it would sort of be like the covert ops change, and possibly fitting it to Blockade Runners instead of industrials as a shitty but manageable solution that would at least make it easier to get a covert industrial cyno in system.
---
Industrial cynos behaving identically to the existing cyno other than what ships it can be fit to is completely pointless, since CCP could have just changed the fitting of the standard cyno to be industrials, force recons and black ops battleships and been done.
---
Why was their response so slow? Just blapping any cyno inty that warped in?
---
yeah, how else do you expect me to respond to it?
---
you're arguing for a buff to what is already a very powerful logistics ability. JF's let you move massive amounts of goods across the game universe, including the supposed most dangerous space with relatively speaking, much more safety and ease than anything else thats meant to transport stuff.
---
i think a nerf to force projection is well warranted and that such a massively powerful ability should come with more organisational cost.
---
Pick one:

EVE's job is to be more fun than it's competition. It's not doing that. So...

I think subs have def fallen, but logins don't reflect actual subs.  Lots of people remain subbed despite not logging in.  Omega subscription data would be much healthier of a statistic and only CCP has this afaik.

To be fairrrrrrrr

I wish so hard you are right.
---
Is the lack of local the problem or is the problem that mechanics that were balanced against local are now overpowered?
---
10b if god roll
---
This is what happens when you argue in bad faith. People who were upset about the cyno changes because it nerf'd caps, instead complained about the impacts on Jump Freighters and memorial vigils. 
---
So they fixed the high skillpoint entry on Jump Freighters and memorial vigils, and everyone freaked the hell out, because the cov ops cyno wasn't actually a problem and they didn't actually care about memorial vigils.
---
Not sure about the quickly part.  Apparently the last couple of years were spent trying to find ~600 wormhole systems, with the collective assistance of Signal Cartel.
---
fewer characters botting and krabbing is great for players imo.  Not so great for CCP's wallet most likely.  However, CCP willing to take an income hit for the health of the game is a good sign to me.
---
I'm a "technically" new player (I played for 2-3 months in 2006) in a small corp playing with a handful of buddies from other games. For me, going in wormholes and low sec has been nothing but a string of losses. I don't have allies I can call when 6 pirates show up to gank my Drake or to help me when I lose an exploration ship for the 4th time because I didn't d-scan for 10 seconds that one time.
---
I don't want to pvp. I'm a filthy casual and I'm tired that "shitting my pants" is the expected reaction when you see someone - **anyone** outside of highsec.
---
Yeah now they have to use a t1 Indy!!!!
---
Good lord!  Thankfully my Kronos is officer-fit with railguns and MJD, y'know, just in case they get too close!
---
Whaling/Krab/Bot hunting is the least interesting PVP eve has to offer, so losing them as targets is no big deal imo.
---
yeah don't pretend this just started happening for CCP, it's been their modus operandi for 10 years now
---
Expect a bitcoin assassin to mail you questionable liquids for leaking that info.
---
Yeah, I got that.
---
The thing is, though, PA now owns CCP (or at least a controlling share), so even CCP as a whole isn't entitled to do as they please with EVE (unless PA says they are...but somehow I suspect that PA cares more about money than about making EVE's developers happy).
---
I too enjoy zero context screenshots that don't even give me the slightest picture of what's actually going on and are the equivalent of a cut up political hit piece soundbite.
---
500m
---
Wonder how fast that would make a nightmare go
---
It was in fact Gobbins, and he's the only one.  Hilarious "so i went for a walk"
---
I feel as though a reduction in EHP and align speed is all that's necessary to ensure that the ultimate subcap crushing machine is making it more stackable and squishy
---
I sincerely hope CCP didn't let him have anything to do with selecting the Muzak that day.
---
Sure it did, your ship hooked up comes equipment with the local server giving you the ability to have your chat channels.
---
If all your in game systems from Concord from chat to maps did not work while cloaked (radio signals did not come from or to your ship) you would have an argument.
---
CSM dudes already have to reveal a certain amount of RL stuff about themselves iirc
---
Now if only this was applied to this meme...
---
dude iv herd from multiple people with views on the inside and csm that ccp doesnt get the game. They dont play the game. They dont understand things aside from maby mashing f1 in a fleet as a grunt or running some missions in highsec and doing some pi.
---
They have Zero fucking clue how logistics work in the game on a scale of more than 1 jump. They had no clue what a fucking impact forcing jf pilots to train 2 extra months per a cyno acount was going to do. Lets not even fucking get into the fact they dont grasp the amount of accounts logistics people need just to serve some deep nullsec pockets. And the fact that when jump changes happened they wanted to make JF 5 light year and went back on it and said they will prob do it later.
---
they just dont fucking get it.
---
The bans aren't actually free; you have to pay for them eventually or CCP will take them back.
---
asuka best girl
---
Have fun scanning down and going through every wormhole system with that
---
Dude probably wasn't on comms while ratting, got surprised and took him a few minutes to log in. It only took about 2:30 to kill him. Fumble like that for 2 minutes and it's a fat chance to save you
---
as someone who ran mass logistics for 7 years i wouldnt bitch about loosing covert cynos ffs. The initial training would be aids but getting cynos into position would go alot smoother than when making a new route and moving noobships getting caught on the gate cus you know the covert cyno ships could cloak?
---
Vily "The Frump Stump"
---
Try bait caps a liiiiiiittttlllleeee harder. Lmao
---
Don’t worry. No wizard hats allowed. 🧙‍♂️
---
Local did not provide this information. If your salty players shared Intel....well go make some friends.
---
Nope. Everything is totally fine.
---
Yah My wife has alrdy started looking at spiking la’croix as a reasonable substitute if we can’t get enough claw
---
It acts like the current cyno - 10 min duration, full system visibility.
---
Real players already rebinded it to more practical keys.
---
there are two sides to this sword. my cyno loses would have dropped to near nothing. On the otherhand every single cyno account would have had to do a 2 month training stint for every single cyno character on that account. Mind you my cyno accounts i only sp farmed one toon just to pay for the account and nothing else but thats 4 months per an account and from the sounds of it the changes were NOT announced with enough lead up time to do this, so short of injecting all my routes would have halted for at least a month, and then thats just one toon per an account, since every cyno account i ran had two toons, that means either half my routes would have not bee serviceable or since some longer routes used the same account in it twice, just not useable.
---
This was a sweeping change not ment to target logistics that ended up almost effecting it the most. And honestly thats the problem at ccp. They have such a narrow fucking tunnel vision they cant see the unintended effects thier changes will have on areas of the game that are not pvp becuase lets face it, csm is like 98% fucking pvpers.
---
Sorry, this is r/eve. We don't talk. You will be downvoted.
---
CoH is totally alive again, just fyi if you didn't already know. Homecoming servers had over 10k concurrent users in the first couple months. Probably lower now but still very lively.
---
I now im thinking of McDonalds..  even though I know it's not what I want.
---
bro, didnt you know, its not pvp so its not important in the greater scheme of things. Gl seeding a route with cyno toons if it passes through npc null. Dying on the gates constantly. Your going to need a week and a scout for every fucking cyno toon to get them placed.
---
zero fuckin idea what they were talking about, and due to NDA i doubt we'll know for sure for a while.
---
thx grath, official PL historian
---
maybe he should start with himself?
---
23/7 bots would be pretty ez to catch, so it wouldn't surprise me to see the distribution of bot online time spread between all TZs, but skewed toward China/Russia TZs. Maybe the OP's data \*does\* show that all these leaving accounts are actual people, but I don't think so, and I also don't think we have enough data to know for \*\*sure\*\* one way or the other.
---
Bot does its thing for 6 hours. Logs out. Another logs in and does its thing for 6 hours. Repeat.

Hey there new bro! Just thought I'd take a second to try and give you some help. Reddit can be a tough place, it's best to take it at your own pace. You mentioned chat bots so it seems like you're talking about Jita Local. This is considered somewhat of an "Trade Hub" for many players, and can be a bit more difficult to see through spam.and chat bots. There's also Amarr, which might be a better fit for you if you're not with Jita Local. On the off chance you decide to try out Amarr (I'm assuming you haven't because you're concerned with chat bots) you can go to fly your unranked hauler right through Niarja which also has local chat! Hope this helps and you find a chatroom to suit your special needs for safety! o7 capsuleer, welcome to New Eden!
---
Aww, the reddit circlejerk strikes again.  I gotchu though.
---
For the t3f, i'm imagining 5 or so subsystems total and you can install 2 at any given time, totally interchangeable. And you would have one or the other active, and can swap them like a t3d. So you are more locked in, but still have flexibility.
---
The leadership frigate being niche is absolutely fine, nithing wrong with niche. There are big problems with a t3 ship being niche though. Its the antithesis of their design.
---
Hi chat bot, can you tell me about bumping freighters for fun and profit,
---
9/10 for overexcited screeching. The footage is magnificent tho!
---
Near2 did and was the only way I felt safe ratting. So sick of CCP driving us PVErs away because of dumb wormholers
---
Wow your thoughts actually mirror my own here.  I beleive this, combined with no reason to use 'middle size ships (cruiser through bs)' outside of special case uses (ADC, new Cyno bullshit), are the big fish to fry for eve to change.
---
Now that you said that, *I* want McDonalds.
---
Now that you made me decide to go there, you also have to decide what I'm going to get (other than fish filet; I don't do seafood). I'm FAR too lazy to decide for myself.
---
It's what I did for 3 years, stopped being fun.
---
It wouldn't be much a problem if ccplz just made current carriers t1 and their super counterparts t2. Would of solved the insurance issue and maybe hamper production.
---
In solo scenarios, sure. But with fax support, and a group of t2 supers launching drones that launch drones? They become even better at blapping subcaps, and dont need to align in a fight, and EHP doesnt matter that much with fax support unless it escalates to titans/more supers to alpha them off the field. Gotta consider multiple scenarios.
---
That would have been a great choice, provisionally peaking. I'd need to think about the repurcussions of that some, but it sounds good at face value. Would need comparable EHP to normal cruisers though, that jump from t1 to t2 hulls is a bit nutty.
---
Hey there new bro! Just thought I'd take a second to try and give you some help. Eve can be a tough game, it's best to take it at your own pace. You mentioned bumping freighters so it seems like you're talking about camping Jita. This is considered somewhat of a "Greifing tactic" for many players, and is significantly easier than other forms of content generation. Players engaged in this will make you believe it's actually "super fucking hard srsly guise" but don't worry, it's just what they say so they don't feel like pieces of shit. There's also Miner bumping, which might be a better fit for you if you're not comfortable with running 20 alts in bombers. On the off chance you decide to try out bumping (I'm assuming you don't have much experience with this so far based on you not seeming like a low effort retard) you can go to other trade hubs where people may not be as alert whole travelling! Hope this helps and you find a playstyle to suit your special needs for safety! o7 capsuleer, welcome to New Eden!
---
Yes, I agree that there are layers of complexity to botting, and that we don't have access to the data to really say much beyond that.
---
You hit the nail on the head.
---
One of the reasons for building citadels around ACLs instead of the current system was to bypass existing corp mechanics.
---
Interesting to see your intelligence is even more limited than your "creativity"
---
Between you and me - I hate having cum delivered to my mailbox, and I prefer to keep it that way.
---
And they DO inflate numbers.
---
The entirety of my knowledge of botting is from watching hunters in wow 10 years ago kill things and pick up flowers or mine. So, I'm in the same boat.
---
The only POS mechanic that ever needed removing was Hilmar

Straight up junkie status

lol you can see it in his eyes that he\`s looking at this and thinking "man I cant wait to delete this"
---
Is it intentional that 95 % of your posts are insulting someone?
---
Repercussion wise, it would probably shake up the t2 market. Pilot wise, not to much. But thats a issue with injectors. 
---
There should of been a limit to skills you could "inject" capital skills among them.
---
Yes.
---
Found the idiot Trumptard
---
The rorq’s PANIC is a great content creator—help the rorq or it dies.  The rorq’s massive local tank is a problem though because now the rorq doesn't need to panic, it can just tank most small gangs indefinitely unless they have substantial neut pressure.  Urgency lost, and the defenders can form in leisure and massively outform the attackers.

---
I think they would be very versatile in their application, it's just that their application is a very predefined role, which I can understand as being an issue. I would like you to expound on what 5 subsystems you would suggest implementing. That sounds like a fun and productive discussion
---
I don’t know who screeches more at this point, the krabs or the “~elite pvpers~”.

You made an assumption. It wasn't accurate. Now that that is out of the way, care to take a second stab and pigeonholing me?

Aw shucks. Thanks for lookin out for me man. But luckily I have enough self hate to spread around to the good people of r/eve with no limit

Ah yes. You are very smart.

Your statement was self admission. I simply pointed out that I saw it and was somewhat amazed.

---
Well, Mustache's answer is probably correct.  I don't use Python so I was not aware of it not using unsigned ints.
---
Wait, I see what you're trying to do here....
---
No near 2 did not. Your INTEL CHANNEL had people reporting. Near2 simply helped you watch the Intel channel. No one reporting Intel/no pings from near 2.
---
I can't keep going, sorry. I should have put /s on my first post :P
---
Bit what I want you to get, isnt what I would want to get, also.. McDonald has loot boxes.    Not sure I can support that
---
the rorq's tank provides a minimum level of commitment from the attacker. It's not a content creator for 5 man nano gangs, its for reasonably large fleets and capitals, which would have no targets otherwise, since intel channels would spot them coming in time for anything non-sieged to get to safety.
---
Now we have blackout and cyno changes that allow smaller gangs to actually get the jump on smaller ratter that would dock up or just light a cyno on anything that tackles them.
---
I mean, I'm ok with an asshole doesn't like me...
---
Half these Krabs are probably that dumb.
---
You ain't winning this month!

Far more than half unfortunately

---
All those years of people telling others to HTFU have come full circle.
---
Good points, but you'll get downvote brigaded. Apparently BB and his ilk have employed sock puppets or Reddit bots to try to start shifting the narrative on Reddit.
---
I've been set a requirement of 10 a month moving forward or I lose dread funding from NC :(
---
Well I'm ok with being an asshole that doesn't like you, so we have a common ground.
---
Get gud. That should be easy with our morons. Is that supers/titans only? or all capitals?
---
I'll trip you at the finish line, wannabe worm holer!
---
&gt; Again, it's not the job of anyone but CCP to come up with solutions to this issue.
---
The game is in a state of contradiction between a sustainable macroeconomy and nullsec activity. It is our job point it out when either of these desiderata are severely harmed. And we do point it out when the macroeconomy is unsustainable, or activity is reduced.
---
Is it our job to offer solutions which don't harm activity yet reduce faucets? I'd say one cannot make a final verdict on something like whether blackout should remain in the game without either:
---
1) Making a case on why reduced playercounts from blackout is worse than the unsustainable macroeconomy (which organically reduces playercounts)
---
OR 
---
2) Making a case which shows that CCP can make the economy sustainable while actually keeping null activity intact.
---
I know people are making final verdicts on blackout without doing 1 or 2. But it's either our job to refrain from a final verdict, or propose an actual solution to the dichotomy. We can't have our cake and eat it too.
---
But do you have a perty mouth?
---
Yes I tried it and no you can't, why the fuck else would I have posted?
---
Thank you Globby, and I agree they NEED to balance ships overall more often.  Regarding cyno's, i dont agree with mittens that often but a spool up mechanic is a decent idea.
---
You'll have to ask your wife
---
Ill reply to this in 2 hours
---
My wife said "don't argue with idiots on the internet". So...
---
I wish it was just an hour :|
---
there is , since blops can jump to industrial cynos, but its still a terrible change yes
---
to clairify on the issue with industrial cynos, they only work on industrial class ships, which are very slow haulers, by default they take 10+ seconds to align to warp, and take up lots of space in a cargo hold so if you want to move them using said jump freighters its going to take alot
---
*the truth cuts the deepest*
---
I wonder if OP realises that JFs can still jump to a normal cyno lit on a force recon, so he doesn't have to burn around in a nereus
---
Well there you go
---
ah right thats a good point.
---
true
---
Same time tomorrow?
---
None, Reddit is a terrible place for good ideas.
---
I'll be there
---
why wouldnt you just keep a cloaked falcon on grid?
---
Are they in nullsec?
---
That takes an extra account for each mining site that could instead be another rorqual
---
I don't give half of a dusty fuck man.
---
If players wanna stagnate their own gameplay fuckem, that's their choice.
---
omggggg rissskkkkk ccplzz going to unsub 3 of my 26 accounts reeeeeeeee
---
Stainguy had a suggestion a while ago that the effectiveness of injected SP, rather than be based on how many SP your character has already, be dependent on the ranking of the skill you are trying to inject into.
---
Are you a high Sp character that want's to try out mining, inject industry at x1 for pretty much 1:1 effectiveness.
---
Did you miss a support skill while off remap and need to fill it, if it's an x2 or x3 it will be somewhat less efficient but doable.
---
Do you want to inject Gallente Titan which is an X16 or Capital industrial ship which is an X12? Get fucked.
---
\&gt;  You're assuming they have any idea how to react. 
---
Assuming that they agree with your assessment that the changes that they made (blackout specifically) are hurting player counts, they don't have to be all that smart to reverse them, right?
---
Most likely they simply don't agree with your assessment, and they have better information than you.  Sucks when reality isn't what you'd like it to be, but, there you go.

omg bots again again again, not every fu unsub is bot

yeah that certainly not the only thing they messed up with fozziesov

CCP should try to conquer a sov by themself there much fun being forced to bring 4 Entos 1sabre instalock + somes inty on each Ihub/TCU just because one player burstjammer frigate / ecm or waiting 50m on a fucking timer fuuun  
---
and after that you need to clean every structure i don't have anything against simple farmer but a small alliance who can't get evict by the second largest coalition in game just because the gamedesign is shit shouldn't happen  
---
but they can't just change this mechanic let's say if sov timer are halved structures soft limited per system (less EHP the more structure...)  there will be still no meaning to war, long ago there was automated moon mining soo more space = more isk but now when you can't handle to mine more moons what the point ? annual content like goon ? meh, fix fozziesov remove asset safety and get rid of "grind-to-play" (less farm more fights!) you will get perpetual war in NS
---
Cloaked recons btw. Assuming you even find something now that barely anybody rorq mines outside of a massive umbrella and lol ratting.
