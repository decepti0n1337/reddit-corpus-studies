Price-wise, defense-wise, discretion-wise, they are just much, much worse.

I looked at your image of your Orca fit and noticed that in order to fit your 500mn Microwarp Drive you dropped quite a few fittings and reduced your tank.   The answer seems to be that many of the fits, or all, indeed, given on Eve Portal and elsewhere are incorrect, and that the only way to fit this drive is the way you have shown?  As I use Fleet boost, this wouldn't suit me. Thank you for your reply.
---
It was fun! Thanks commander A9 for the event, people like you make EVE what it is!
---
Also thanks to uwu owo iwi ewi owtfo or whatever your insanely difficult name is, thank you as well.

Hey watching the host get sloppy drunk and say silly eve shit can be a good time!

I'll take 1000 goons in shitfits over a super brawl any time of day

I just wanted to add that you can click on as many modules as you want when doing that, so you can use your weapon and a warp scrabmler (or any other offensive module) as soon as possible. It’s great for pvp.
---
Seriously, Eve was life changing because it presented the existential crises in a very relatable format.

Gratz buddy and have fun losing it, no point in letting ships sit in station and collect dust. provide content or sell it to bankroll your start to PvP, thats what i am doing with the paladin i scored for 10M

Elite Dangerous only gives fines if your speed is above 100m/s when you bump into something. Plus the fine is like 100Cr which is about as much as 100ISK would be in EVE, in other words, meaningless.

---
This could be /r/oddlystatisfying material if it wasn't for the one provi fucking it up.
---
how do you differentiate those leading to an active region from those leading to just a random system?
---
1. Use the referral code to get 1 million SP.
---
2. If you have 5$ to spare then get the 5$ starting pack deal from their website for another bunch of free SP
---
3. Do not spend all of your skill points just yet - continue to 4. and 5. to figure out what you enjoy doing in the start before burning off skill-points.
---
4. Do the tutorial in-game. No, seriously, do the tutorial.
---
5. Continue with the Career Agents (*note: doing a career agent missions* ***does not lock you in*** *to be a miner or explorer etc. You can do all the career agent missions)*. - This will give you a few free frigates to play with (combat frigs from combat career agent, exploration frigate from explo agent, mining ship from the mining guy etc)
---
6. After doing all that then look up  [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main_Page) as their website has A LOT of good information that answers pretty much any question you will have about the game.
---
7. Regardless what you plan to do some essential skills to get are:
---
   1. **CPU Management** \- Increases CPU output in ship so you can fit better modules.
---
   2. **Power Grid Management** \- Increases power grid output in ship so you can fit better modules.
---
   3. **Capacitor Management** \- Increase capacitor capacity so modules can stay active longer.
---
   4. **Capacitor System Operation** \- Increases recharge rate on capacitor so modules can stay active longer.
---
   5. **Hull Upgrades (to level IV)** \- Allows fitting Damage Control II module as well as other good modules.
---
8. Never fly something you can't afford to lose - **this is really EVE Rule #1.** If you just spent all your money on a new shiny ship then there is a hundred ways for that to get blown up, many outside of your control as nowhere is safe in EVE, so make sure you can afford the loss.
---
9. Don't be afraid to lose ships (as long as you can afford to replace them) - ships getting blown up is a key feature in EVE. Think of it like this... if no ships are blown up then noone will need the ore being mined and noone will need to buy things of the market. Ship destruction is what keeps the economy going. Do your part.
---
I hope the above points help.
---
Some quick ways to make money early on, depending what you like.
---
1. Exploration - easy to do, can be done anywhere, low entry costs but can give good rewards (if lucky)
---
2. Mining - can be kinda boring, but you get a free Venture mining ship from the Mining Career agent so very low entry cost and easy, steady income in start.
---
3. Combat missions - a bit more fun, lets you learn how combat works and always good to start working on getting positive standing with NPC corporations to get better rewards and make use of their loyalty point stores.
---
4. Faction Warfare - this is probably much to underused by new players, but can be one of the most rewarding ways to make money. Plus it lets you get into the PvP and such as well.
---
Anyways, good luck out there!

I've been dropping cruisers with carrier, and the reason why we do that is simple : it's efficient and quick, deathclone, hop in, jump.
---
Ofc I'd enjoy a gf with my own cruisers (specially fitted to fight against the roamers for sure) but sometimes you just can't, or it's easier another way around.
---
(But I wouldn't even try vs frigs. Only fax to save stupid peeps)
---
Ah yes. My most fav'd T3 Cruiser.  
---
Looking like a snowmobile with proper subsystem configuring.  
---
Also - It can instantly switch from "Bloodraider" mode (NOS/Neut config) to "Guristas" mode (Msl + Drone config), for example. ;)
---
yep, not with a hawk and not darks, but still possible
---
So no real point in paying that much for it? I know it's a dual analyzer but don't have a fitting issue so not worth it for me atm.
---
Bro.
---
I write it slowly, so maybe you will understand it.
---
Just 'cause you declared it, your statement will not become magically true. That's so simple. Also just 'cause you start personal attacks your statement still not become magically true.

I think the the leadership at the time specifically tried to make it as cancerous as possible

Jesus, it hurts to watch that, when u use a mouse to activate modules. BTW. I have seen you couple times in low sec, u are always annoying as hell, trying to teach everyone around, but truly u hide and run from most fights, lol.

as i wrote on that other reply already, i highly doubt CCP will invest in untangling all those informations to conform to GDPR
---
and also that somebody who wants to have all his peronal data removed from CCP (by the way Email is required to manage an account) wanting to play the game anymore, this is highly unusual i would say and not worth to invest for (and not required by law, only te removal of personal data, any side effects are not defined AFAIK)

I log in my webber alt, just in case , only 5b in the freighter but you never know.

My alt goes to the pig, I enter jita.My alt warps to me, pre load the web, I warp to insta, get webbed, warp off … just at the same time the freighter next to me explode victim of +-30 catalysts.

It was during the 100% loot event. My webber alt looted 100M of guns. The freighter kill did not appear on zkb.

What ICANP does is covered by Concord Spam Protection Act, which is able to be blocked in your mail settings. Alternatively you can just block the whole corporation if that what you so desire. What people dont realize is any type of spam outside of CSPA, is not allowed and is against EULA. What ICANP does is not against anything except morality for spamming.

Yes you have rights. Yes there are laws companies need to hold to. But a mistake can be made by anyone. Waving with "muh rights" when your email isn't being read for whatever reason (it could not have even reached them). Just makes you look like an uneducated American you see in all these YouTube videos, talking about their freedom of speech after threatening a police officer with violence. (No I am not calling all Americans uneducated)
---
You can also just act like a normal human being and send a follow-up email. You could and probably should have done that 7 days after sending your first 1 instead of just waiting until you could threaten a company with the GDPR.

They do away with the whole concept of borders. Now up to 25 ships can appear deep in your territory with no warning and none of the usual fit reqs to run a blockade.

No they shouldn't. Let them decide what they want to share

Dude, you shouted at a deaf guy for not listening!

That sounds..a bit high for dual dreads. Maybe triple dreads? That said, the risk for dread ratting should be higher (and the site profit along with it, still has to be worth and cover losses) right now it’s just a faucet.

Get off that soapbox already.
---
Thanks. I know I take a long time between videos, I appreciate you remaining interested. 
---
What is your opinion on me doing some less scripted narrative type videos and maybe something a bit more like free commentary on single engagements?
---
The reason I ask is that it takes a long time to capture enough recordings to create a full narrative driven video with it's own short story but I could much more frequently release commentary style videos about smaller single recording type events.
---
Things that take upkeep and are reliable in their effects (this ansiblex always goes from A to B, and has access control) are good, RNG 25 ship fleet drops past borders are bad.
---
Underrated comment.

Just No

I support this, they themselves should experience the bs we experience xD.

The original comment is about gotg ("Whenever test doesnt know what to do next they attack GOTG"). The entire post is about gotg.

---
Total cost of the nodes has to be above market value (if seller is looking to profit) and that is not a scam. Nothing about the hypernet is a scam so this strategy isn't going to work. Although I would assume just the act of spamming in npc corp chat is probably punishable, I wouldn't know.

Dev's have always been allowed to play, they just weren't allowed to reveal who they were before which made it hard to participate in some areas of the game.

Haha what are you talking about? How is making money off hypernet suspicious? It's not meant to be charity, the seller takes on a certain level of risk to get a higher than usual profit margin.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Bad odds =/= scam. For something to be a scam, aka fraud, you would have to operate in bad faith which means withholding some vital piece of information. So in your coin example you would have to have trick coins that can never land in said pattern, or just that you intend to run and never pay up if the rare occurrence did happen. Otherwise, it's just a bad investment opportunity. The buyer has all info available to them in game to make a decision.
---
This isn't 3 card monte on the street corner where the dealer is luring you in with small wins then using sleight of hand to guarantee you lose the big bet. That's a scam, they cheated.
---
All I'm getting at is that if you report these people for scamming then nothing will happen because that is not what's going on. Report them for spam (if that's a thing), teach newbros about basic math so they don't gamble when they can't afford it, start a corp for helping newbros to get them away from that spammed/scammer chat, etc. will be better uses of your time and effort.
---
&gt; I think it's a good change because it makes dropping supers on roamers a bit harder. 
---
One of the amusing side effects of this, is that its actually easier to hide bait alts. In the past, it was common to put a cyno on a procurer or something; but that made it pretty easy to identify bait after a few drops.
---
Now, since the cyno needs to be on a different ship, the bait looks like an innocent victim or unrelated kill. It also means that trolling bait requires more coordination between bait and cyno shadows.

at least during moon and dominion sov, defenders could rep structures against incoming damage to stop a stupid fleet of 150 cerberuses or boosh ravens from invalidating literally anything anyone else on the grid is doing

i played during moon sov and dominion sov and they both had pros and cons. fozziesov's only real merit, imho, is the adm system. the actual mechanics of capturing and defending sov are pretty aids

Personally, I would say follow them around and see what ships they are flying. If they are flying ships that are accessible by alpha's then there is some evidence for your report. However 20 omega accounts is not unheard of... it's only like  $250 a month if you use subscription, pretty much on par with a car payment

It's a suppository

A cool ui for first person would be nice, but idk about any sort of buffs or effects while using first person. An eve grid is 3D space, and having the situational awareness is key to surviving just about any engagement. I need to be able to see my opponent, where they are, and what they are doing. I don’t think it’s super feasible in first person mode.

Hundreds of attempts, about half refunded, the rest lost except 1 fully researched bpo.

I've lost about 40 million, but the bpo sells for about 150 million. I think I'm ahead.

I don't like throwing away isk I can't afford to lose, so I set my filter to anything less than a million and once in a while buy a single hypernode on a longshot. Unlikely to win that bpo or ship - but hey, once in a while it happens.
