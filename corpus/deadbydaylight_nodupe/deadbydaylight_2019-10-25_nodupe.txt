Ok guys we get it. We all love Otz.
---
Oh shit how do you unlock these
---
idk, I've been on both sides of it, if they're wiggling i assume they think they can escape still, if they don't i just assume they've either given up or i'm looking for hatch. as a survivor i just give up on death/last person hook because there's no point in fighting it at that point.
---
you need to sale these in poster form I need a framed one for each cover. Incredible please make posters then shut up and take my money!
---
True. Ghostface is fine where he is right now. Getting of a lean stalk mid chase is where it's at.

It was 32 friggin degrees yesterday, I hate hot weather

GODDAMN THIS IS AWESOME

Low-key I've been waiting every day for this issue. Can't wait for the next one.

Killer is underpowered as a whole meaning that nothing a killer can do is truly overpowered. Things can be good, annoying, powerful, ect. But no matter how good whatever they have is, whether its a mori, noed, good addons, decent killer, survivors can end the game in three minutes. That doesn't really give killers enough time to do things. I play survivor and killer and I'm able to say with an non-bias opinion that survivor games are easier than killer games. Moris are really good, but, if a killer can only get 1-2 hooks with 30 second chases before the gens are done, does an ability that works after youve hooked someone matter. Obviously, moris and keys are both bad for the game but keys will always be better as long as killer is worse than survivors.
---
EDIT: also, id like to see the statistics for nurse being used mored than keys. Seeing as there is a one to four ratio of killers and survivors every match i find it hard to believe that nurse is played more than keys are used. Feels like you're spitting bullshit for you're argument to sound stronger, it's making it worse.
---
Not JUST a rapist.
---
Vore
---
Probably just Knock Out with a custom icon. You know, for slugging.
---
You have to sacrifice each of the original four survivors (Dwight, Meg, Claudette and Jake) 25 times.
---
I level her up with BP from the last Blood hunt in about two days to unlock ruin. There might be one during the upcoming event but it hasn't been confirmed. But then I started playing her and she's actually ridiculously fun, it's very interesting trying to find good places to set her traps. So you might honestly just have fun playing her to level her up as you already have her.
---
I can't say for certain but it's most likely Deerstalker.
---
Actually wasn’t Legion, it was Plague that made me leave. Thought she was way more annoying
---
Deerstalker. He just edited the image on the files.
---
You're right. Those were the two that came to mind then thinking of those eggs sacks
---
These are so cute! I need more!
---
Huntress is the one that was just a child when she lost her mother. My guess is that she wouldn't know how to react.
---
DC’ing makes you scum, end of discussion. If your teammate is being camped and a save can’t be made, bang out gens and leave. If you’re being camped and a save can’t be made, struggle as long as you can so your teammates can bang out gens and leave. The best way to fight camping is to punish the playstyle by counterplaying, not by DC’ing and getting yourself banned

Bruh I'm a survivor main. The joke is funny, no one is siding with toxic killers.
---
I have played her but I hate playing so many hex totems
---
use this one:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnA1tNs8klI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnA1tNs8klI)  xD
---
"Alright, I've hooked that guy just now, so I'll check on some gens and- oh he's off the hook. Well then I'll proc the BT- oh he doesn't have it. Right I'll just eat his DS- oh he doesn't have that either. Huh."
---
Lol
---
While it hasn't been long at all since last bloodhunt, they really should attach that to this event at release just as a consolation prize and a token of their apology for it all. I'll be happy with that and can forgive.
---
Still just genuinely confused as to why I'm being personally attacked, for asking what the meme had to do with my comment, or why it was directed at me, but alright.
---
I would love to see this on a Christmas sweater
---
I find it really funny when you are stumping survivors and they get ruin 2 sacrifices into the match. Yeah guys, that's gonna help you a lot.
---
I mean, I literally asked what the joke had to do with my comment, and I'm getting personally attacked, all I've said is "whack" Not sure how I'm the toxic one here?
---
People debate facts all the time. Saying that something being debatable makes it an opinion is just wrong.
---
Well, you know, its pretty popular to hate on America, so honestly, I'm not surprised.
---

---
Just like its popular to call the opposing side you disagree with names.
---
For real tho, maybe she could have an add-on that starts the timer straight away?
---
I mean c'mon, Pig needs some love
---
Lol with this build they might out of their way to spill their hatred lol
---
The type of people that camp would be ecstatic if everyone rage quit and killed themselves. Easy 4ks, lots of salt, plenty of GG EZ to be made.
---
thats the corrupted monk from sekiro
---
&gt;Still just genuinely confused as to why I'm being personally attacked
---
For a) being oblivious to the joke and then b) doubling down
---
Or all five with each being worth a fifth of it and makes you chose between noed and ruin

The key to any pun master is to say all that come to mind because you know they are hilarious and follow up by laughing at you're own brilliant joke
---
If you get the no one escaped bonus, it's a guaranteed pip, at least black pip if a full pip is too much regardless of rank. And if you don't kill everyone, then what you get is still normal, the only thing that changes is a single criteria for a black pip.
---
Imagine if the devs actually saved their progress
---
My inly conclusion is that devs have their computers running 24/7 soo they lost everything
---
#
---
Nah with servers at the moment she can throw it straight into the air and somehow across map trough 3 walls, 2 haybails and a gen, I get hit by a hatchet
---
At Rank 15 it might be a little much but not “toxic”
---
That would be too op. Maybe the third gen including the last, bad all? That’s just stupid
---
There’s something about the “four tantalizing tales...” text that bothers me. The way it’s angled to looks really strange to me in conjuncture with the text on the bottom. I feel like it would look better if it was straight. Everything else is dope as hell.
---
What are you trying to do here lol? Start a movement haha?
---
I’d actually like for BHVR to rework some current killers before adding anything new to the game, legion, pig, wraith and canibal all need to be changed or buffed, legion in particular needs to be reworked bad, no one really likes them how they are but legion mains and I still play them because they look cool as shit. 
---
Seriously BHVR, if you’re listening, *everyone* would like a legion rework, *everyone* would like a pig rework, only *some* of us would like a new killer, I haven’t even finished leveling all my killers let alone the band new gorgon and the fairly-new ghostface
---
I was going to comment: plot twist its haunted grounds, then it turned out it actually was, nice move
---
More unprompted personal attacks lol. Y'all are real friendly people.
---
This is absolutely adorable.
---
Did I say something wrong? I’m confused.
---
Nice
---
*sigh* I did.
---
damn that was pretty stellar, I'm sure that survivor was like wtf
---
I'd say had has some scare potential aswell, more than Freddy in my personal opinion
---
I don’t think that would work for high and low rank, the middle point I could go with is the same point but let’s say if you go over 5% penalize on sacrifice it goes to black pip instead of pip and you don’t get points on that category if you are being penalized while the survivor goes into 2nd stage/sacrifice. That would be nice.
---
Yeah its fine
---
This is awesome
---
At this point I'm sure they have enough money to hire people and fix server problems, I have friends who spend money on half of the cosmetics that come out and I'm sure many people are the same.
---
Campers are cancer, but DC’ing is infinitely worse. Source: The Fucking Rules
---
No its a thing now, survivor can escape before the killer closes the hatch
---
So damage control for the patch not being out this month. Got it.
---
Bugs are amazing, a couple of days ago I got first time hooked by a wraith, somehow my character became unable to interact with, while I started spectating the wraith, also the game didnt end for 10 minutes, even after I dcd
---
As a part time killer player, I can appreciate some of the fun in killer matches, even those where I’m losing and things are more intense. Survivor is definitely a more relaxed gameplay that’s often easier to enjoy, even though it too gets annoying.
---
Yes because it's a business, not a charity. And almost everything in this game that's not cosmetics or licensed are free or can be purchased with the free currency. Remind me what the issue here is.
---
You can't really get the full experience of what the game has to offer if you don't. Dedicated or not.
---
the Purge you spewed upon the walls
---
the loss of pips you didn't have
---
Ask EA they started this shit.
---
The past two days I’ve been stuck with the worst players ever. Worst thing about it is that they’re usually purple and red ranks too. I have no idea what’s happening

Please keep doing these!!!! I wanna see one for The Huntress and David King since they are my two favorite characters.
---
cool outrun
---
Yes, but we also have to pay a fair amount for the base game anyway. I don't know if you remember star wars battlefront 2, but they've been adding tons of free content for years despite not doing well on launch, with the only microtransactions being cosmetics. I think OPs' problem is that there's an entry fee, £60+ of DLC content which can give big advantages (cough, cough, spirit) as well as cosmetics as expensive as most free games AND now a battle pass. It's a bit much, don't you think? I get that behaviour is a smaller dev team, but this is getting kinda ridiculous.
---
Pure poetry.

At around 530 pm today I was rank 9, as of right now... rank 14....

Bruh, grabbing a beer while doing a gem is pro-flexing.

A fellow sadist of culture I see.
---
Survivor propganda trying to make killers believe that they should let the survivors escape! Do not let them fool you!
---
When I see shit like that I honestly just kill them and let the others live.
---
DBD goes on sale almost every holiday for like 10$ lol

---
I don't know, people get pissy at weird shit
---
Oh, yeah, I've just been playing survivor the past two weeks. It's a million times less stressful, even while learning to use dead hard and taking agro. 
---
 I'll go back to playing killer when I want to stop having an easy time, I guess.
---
demogorgon just vibin
---
/s?
---
Do it again.
---
I've never seen someone do that. They do it after hook though
---
Yeah it’s a nerf but they’ll still butcher survivors post patch
---
It's because the free currency is very grindy. I have over 250 hours and I have enough to buy 3 characters. That's it. I was also a player who had previously played at console red ranks for both roles, so I came in already fairly good at the game and so was levelling up faster than most. When a character is as strong as Laurie or spirit and it takes roughly 200 hours to get them both, I feel something's wrong with using this as an excuse for the abundance of microtransactions
---
I’m excited to see how you portray Myers. I hope it’s as visually striking as the first two!
---
Had a guy run only Thrill of The Hunt. The way he defended it we thought it was Devour Hope or something. True big brain plays.
---
Yeah, I do see that but I assume as she was in the wild she would have experienced animal do things? But as for hag she was kidnapped and brutally tortured and then the entity took her.
---
Actually when I think about it she could have knowledge depending on what those people did......
---
Exactly how I feel at the moment. I picked up the game for the first time last year, played for a good few months but dropped it after just getting so frustrated with the messages and dirty tricks mid game. I started playing again recently and was having fun until the messages started, if you can't tell I'm a killer main. 
---
I've found that regardless of what you do you'll get blamed for camping, tunneling and just straight up being toxic despite simply just playing the game. Some guy messaged me today about how he was going to report me for camping, I explained I had only a 2% proximity to hooked survivors throughout the match, in response he then blames me for tunneling him.. I just give up. 
---
All the while I'll just sit and ignore the t-bagging, looping and unnecessary flash lighting I come across nearly every match. Don't get me wrong I play survivor occasionally and I get to an extent why people do some of this stuff if it genuinely helps you escape a killer but cmon. For the time and effort it takes to simply just load a lobby/match I just feel it really isn't worth it.
---
Here is the thing, if you look at this totem placement objectively, it is very hidden. The totem is pushed in all the way with two pile of tires to hide them.
---
The problem here is not the generator right beside it but the fact that these totems have a force spawn tied to LT walls. Wrecker's Yard is the easiest map to remove all 5 totems because it has multiple LT walls and almost every one of them has a totem like this.
---
New friend: "me and Michael are having a staring contest"
---
Cool. I never said anything related to that. It’s objectively a nerf still.
---
I would legit buy this series as framed prints, very cool!

"Ok but what if we make an annoying killer EVEN MORE ANNOYING!"
---
You would have to shoot that from so far away and I still don't think it would hit. But I would love to see it. Tell me if it works out.
---
Yeah, Freddy got a rework and is one of the best killers now, he can use one of 3 add ons to get dream pallets instead of dream snares
---
This is really cool I love this idea let me know if you decided to make more~!
---
Probably fixing the netcode and making the hitboxes realistic.
---
Was it spirit? lmao
---
Totem placements
---
even with the mental state of a 6 year old the huntress still went through puberty, theres probably some primal snoo-snoo desire in there somewhere
---
holy shit roasted
---
I wish the survivors had a second option to get out (and no, not the hatch.) Like a different way to get out other than the generators.  Kinda like how they have different options in the game Friday the 13th to escape Jason.
---
Id change the perk system. I love the way mk11 made the variation system, some moves conflict with one another so you can only pick one.
---
Id start by increasing the perk limit to 5 and then start adding conflicts to multiple perks. I get that survivors only have perks and items but its so easy to play survivor that you can play without perks and be fine. But some builds make it ridiculous to combat as killer and sometimes impossble to play aginst effectively.
---
For killers they would have a select group for their 5th perks that can only be 5th perks. These are the weaker ones that dont really do much but sometimes give you that extra edge. 
---
I just feel like the 4 slot system is outdated
---
That'll probably be just as bad. I'm sure you'll still have to play as killer.
---
Nah I was hag, I wish I was spirit. It wouldn't have been so stressful. lol

Please, god.

its definitely a spirit

Devs -"We can nerf the cuteness too, FYI"
---
You'll either have a great time or it will be terrible. The good usually outweighs the bad for me lol
---
You are aware that you don't have to do dailies right? Just reroll bad ones, and then delete if you don't wanna do it. Simples.
---
It applies perfectly. I understand the term, hence why I used it? Sorry you don't seem to understand the context though. Let me break it down for you. 
---
I am implying that any video game developer who gains the undying support of mostly innocent fans, who then shovel cash out of their pockets and actively defend their money-grubbing design choices is akin to a malicious power brainwashing a prisoner into loving the torture and captivity.
---
Sorry you don't agree, or see the connection, but I do. Downvote if you feel that will make my opinion worth less, I guess? But please don't try to belittle me.
---
USE CHAINSAW
---
🍵
---
Maybe they'll shut the game down due to "unforeseen circumstances" afterwards.
---
whenever killers drop me very far from hatch, it's 100% chance to be hatch closing troll so I troll them back by being afk at the spot they dropped me and browse reddit while those cunt were waiting for me to take the bait.
---
I don’t DC on it, but every time I see an offering for it I really wanna pop open Task Manager.
---
I think the real problem is that if some of these killers decide to be unfair they can make the game basically unplayable. That shouldn’t be possible in a balanced game.
---
You forget that a lot of the subreddit is boosted and genuinely thinks that perks like Sprint Burst, Urban, and Spine Chill are top tier.
---
I mean we’re talking BHVR this small task would take a decade
---
You can add me to the list because i do the same thing haha
---
You wording the spirit thing like that makes me seem like some toxic spirit main lol. I'm not saying you need all of them, but it certainly helps, doesn't it. I'm more concerned with killer tbh. Playing without ruin, pop, discordamce, bbq, monitor, PWYF, STBFL, etc is kinda hard. I get what you're saying with sales, but I don't agree with the idea of discounted prices being a justification. I could understand if they were base prices but they aren't. I'm not against them charging for DLCs tho, because they clearly put a lot of passion into each update. It's when there's both cosmetics and a battle pass on top that kinda annoys me.
---
He's in the same tier as Freddy /s
---
I'm trying to get my main (Ash) leveled up again after prestiging, so I need the bloodpoints. As for deleting them, you can only delete one a day, and I try not to because I'm scared of getting even worse ones, like trapper's (which relies far more on survivors screwing up than the others), or Hillbilly's (if you don't play killer regularly, his ability is damn near impossible to pull off).  
---
Of course, some are insanely easy, like Doctor's. Pig's and Legion's aren't too bad. My last one tonight (I got the nurse and legion ones after making this post) is just chasing as wraith, so I don't even need to use the ability.
---
Who cares. His unrelated comment was funnier than your failed attempt at humour anyway
---
As a survivor main I think this is dumb
---
Freddy was uncalled for though... REALLY uncalled for
---
STBFL is in a fine spot, the perk is meta but it really changes his play style from a killer who puts on pressure by making everyone mend and heal themselves, to an M1 killer who gets a movement speed buff when you hit m2
---
Boop the snoot
---
Guess you can’t rely on a free win this game.
---
Why do you put question marks at the end of everything? Are you one of those people that always talks like they're asking a question?
---
nice i will say besides the toxic survivors/killers the DBD community is really nice
---
until 2 minutes have passed
---
Camping with his power (occasionally)
---
Not really. If the teammates keep sandbagging you or getting instantly killed, you get save points, but they don’t save you. 
---
Had a series of games in a row that were 1 or 2 hook deaths. Usually the second hook is when the killer is right there and no borrowed time. And no, Kindred did not help. 
---
Most of the time it is a safety pip at best.
---
Most games I've had only last a few minutes because we just get snowballed. That and somehow I must've hit every killer going the mori daily.
---
You said you were frustrated? And McCote said to play Civilization if you were frustrated with Dead by Daylight?
---
Glad you enjoy her now. I find her a lot of fun on both sides, actually. Risky for survivors but not necessarily super easy for Plague herself.
---
Yep dailies are now useless. The complete maybe 1 every two weeks. When I finally get one I want to do like complete 3 gens it magically changes to something else. Broken and useless.
---
You can literally run in a straight line from bubba to escape the chainsaw unless he has PWYF maybe what?
---
Does "*You were meant to destroy the sith, not join them!*" fit here?
---
My favorite part of the legion costume is the wraps around the hands, its a minuet detail but I love it for some reason! I can’t wait to see your costume when its finished!
---
Right. So wanting to level makes you feel pressured to play Nurse etc.
---
Ok so waiting for a lobby for 5-10min, to play a killer you don't know, or like, and having a bad experience because of it, is not bloodpoint effiecient.
---
If you deleted it and just played survivor, you probably would've had 2 games, earned BP, and (I can't stress this enough) you have fun.
---
You'd probably still be earning BP for Ash right now if you weren't so salty so as to come to reddit.
---
See the dailies as supplementary, not compulsory.
---
You’d think people would learn from previous Kickstarter games, but god are we hopeful.
---
ah yes 4k quite unlike the quality of this picture
---
I played a game on Meat Factory against Ghostface. Completed a gen then got chased for 3 minutes straight. Finally got downed and hooked to see my three teammates crouching and in lockers on the other side of the map. The three of them combined did one gen all game, and we powered the exit gates. Sigh.
---
What is p3
---
A typical bubba 4k
---
Yeah, it took me a loooong time to understand how to play her, and that’s one of the things that really frustrated me. I definitely do enjoy playing her so much now though.
---
ye i dont know how i would have reacted if i was the dwight
---
Top comment
---
Excellent! Thank you for sharing this, you're a great talent!
---
Well the game was supposed to be based on solo queue but now solo survivors are the weakest thing in the game and basically a free win for any killer. Ridiculous state of the game.
---
Ok
---
I seldom use it, but when I do it's for nothing more than info on killer location. A quick glance then flick away
---
I think thats what it was supposed to be used for anyway
---
As a killer main I now feel bad for solo ques.
---
Remove Decisive and NOED
---
Just  saying, this is dope. The reflection and the fact that his eyes are pitch black, you did an amazing fucking job. Would love to see more from you!
---
You forgot the 10-15 minutes of queue time as killer.
---
I like the alliteration :)
---
Someone popped into my chat and was *very* passionate about that slight cooldown “ruining the entire killer,” while neglecting to note that her ability to ignore entire map structures and game mechanics is still unchanged and perfectly intact. Some people just really hate their unbalanced things being nerfed.
---
To make it feel more unique if this ever happens, the fifth perk can only be a character's personal perk exclusively.
---
Imagine trying to tunnel with this shit. You hit the guy just unhooked and he has borrowed, catch up to him pick him up and get decisive striked, catch him a third time pick him up and get fucking tackled. That would be hilarious.
---
I solo to rank 1, it’s appreciated. The game is truly a different experience solo lol.
---
Suuure but "you guys had toolboxes so it's okay that I tunnel/camped because I didn't want to get gen-rushed" is a lousy excuse for being a jerk.
---
..spine chill is much better than both of those
---
I don’t find swearing attractive so I choose not to. I say Frak because of Battlestar and Gorramit because of Firefly and I’m fine with it.
---
Those houses are actual infinites worse than the infinites in the older maps, at least with those they close off after 3 vaults, with the myers house the survivor can just switch to another infinite window
---
Might be cool if only the bad/super situational perks are restricted to this slot. A lot of fun perks just never get used cuz theyre too narrow.
---
I'll often play for a bit to suss out whether they're super optimal or not.
---
If they're just playing normally, I'll stick around, I still hate the map but it's much less painful
---
If they have balanced and run the infinites or long ass loops I just yet my ass outta there.
---
Two pips is a small price to pay for not playing that map and inflicting suffering upon myself
---
Same, i think the game is just busted right now
---
If I want to get the ''Taking One for the Team'' achievement, do I have to get unsafe unhooks every time?

Agree with him 100%

Btw can we buff spirit? I should be able to see survivors and instadown them after phasing
---
I somehow got matched with a rank 20 who apparently never play a game in his life or watched a god damned video and when the generators where finished he camped one door xd, obviously our goal was to open that door, we had to do it xd
---
The 3 man?
---
Happened to me on PC. The next time a gen got done it updated to 3
---
Or make it so distressing gives 100% deviousness bloodpoints on top of what you make in-game. That and make more perks rely on TR, like Surge; as is, Surge just isn't worth it when there are huge maps that only guarantee you'll regress 1 gen.
---
M8 thats cool. Someone teased my drawing that i posted for r/dyinglight. Keep it up bro
---
Theres not really any OP survivor perks, it would just be for fun really. Killers have tons of rediculously OP perks, I think it’d be cool if they both had an option to add a 5th perk slot. Like I said, instead of an Offering &amp; Item, they can bring another perk. This wouldn’t even be OP at all.

Novaween? Hallomber?

*oh*

I’d agree if you are good at playing stealthily, but if you want to get chased the other perks are better. Spine chill is great, but dead hard can make a chase last another 20 seconds or 2 minutes which makes the perk amazing. Depends on your play style though.
---
I remember a played a game againts a freddy on Ormond (im a main p3 claudette with 2k hours) on rank reset, my useless team got absolutely demolished while he didnt see me the whole game, he started to slug the living crap of a jake and i kept healing him until he was about to die until he got hooked (the whole time he was looking for me with passion), when he was dead i was already on a door waiting for him to close the hatch, when he did it i opened it and escape BY AN INCH and he was so furious he dc'd. good times.
---
i felt this
---
Yeah but the problem with that is pc will get left in the dust our queue times aren’t any better then consoles if crossplay will have happen they can’t ignore what platform for another it’s like ignoring the PS4 community from cross play it wouldn’t be fair
---
My main issue is not the delay, but the fact that the blight cosmetics came out before, and even have a sale on them if you buy with auric cells. If the actual event and new game mechanics have to wait, then the cosmetics should too.
---
I love it!! If you make more, definitely post them
---
I am truly sorry hear you are right
---
I love when that happens
---
A bait of excellent quality!
---
Ur right every bug fix adds 3 more. And hell BHVR used to be owned by overkill who is also known for their glitches
---
Uhh is there something you wanna tell us

Halloween is, but americas the only one with thanksgiving 5 minutes after whining that it's not Halloween season any more when the event is literally going to be on halloween
---
99% of the time solo que. Not meaning this to come off snobby, but I don't understand why so many find it hard.
---
Goddamn killer killed me and didnt play according to my rules!
---
Play drunk or high and you will enjoy the game regardless of the result. Serious and not serious as this works for me.
---
I've been solo que since initial release though, so I def have a lot of practice. But just always be doing something. And you'll get your points and pip.
---
More mechanics to work with like this will be really cool
---
Stop harassing me. My fee fees are hurt.
---
It's a hit or miss. Without balanced landing the map itself is pretty bad, most of the pallets are garbage. You really need balanced landing to be able to keep looping the house, the stagger is crippling otherwise.
---
You are pretty much banking on the map spawning one of those bs fences and have them be more in your favour than the killer's, as that can happen too. It's a pretty unenjoyable map for everyone involved.
---
Ps4?
---
Yeah, but when they ran to places I haven't been before. It was a free escape
---
I'd add to this that as far as sports and other physical activities is concerned, being born in the right body gives you an edge. LeBron James is physically superior to me in most, if not all, sports and that's because he has the genes to be a stud. Add to that his determination to be the best at what he enjoys, or "talent", and it quickly becomes an insurmountable challenge to best him in sports. 
---
However, if we're talking about who can drop the biggest douce then LeBron James will run away scared. I am the king, baby.
---
By fair do you mean not toxic?
---
BHVR: Oh shit you found an easter egg
---
Balanced it all depends on survive with friends survivor perks items add ons as well  killer perks add ons etc of course skill also comes into play
---
Simple ass, guides! To clear out misunderstandings with toxicity. Like is camping,tunnel really part of the game? Their reasoning in why instaheal,bnp,moris exsit. How to play as any side and not just the good for nothing tutorial.
---
If Devs set their stance there would be no reason for the survivors rule book on how to play killer
---
Yes if u are a girl the quality of your drawing are double as good /s
---
Nah but it really doesnt matter and people shouldnt care
---
So that means you can get the currency even after the event is over.
---
I've only been playing shortly before the Plague's release but no, not from what I've seen. From what other people have said, it is possible that they lost progress from losing power at their offices a few days ago.
---
It wasn't directed at you dumbass. He was piggy backing off your comment to make the joke. Jesus just take the L and move on, it's embarrassing at this point
---
Both. I find survivor more fun even though I lose more, also as a killer I'm not really out for blood most of the time, I hook them a few times and let them all go.
---
“He’s not charged, right?”
---
GF mains when a survivor is mad about being camped for the whole game
---
I'll be honest, I don't know how you can hit all perks on 2 characters and 1000 hours without hitting rank 1
---
And while they’re at it can they make his prestige outfit look the same in a trial as it does in the menu screen?
---
So cute 💕
---
Survivor cuz I feel that it’s actually a horror game that way. When you playing Killer you just playing chase.
---
I mean, a Panzersoldat would be cooler.
---
because people H O R N Y
---
I'm scared to go in that subreddit so can someone tell me what it is?
---
Would add an incentive for leaving someone you could save to die so while itd be nice im not so sure itd be a healthy idea
---
The Facebook communities are a bit rude, but other than that - I totally agree 💕
---
Well as long as that’s not your typical game style. I understand doing shitty stuff for rituals. Honestly the only time I play killer is to either rack up bp quick or ritual. I’m just that one guy who absolutely hates the wraith. Anyone I say this to says he’s nerfed but I just have no skill against him.
---
I think its useful for chases while doing gens, mostly. If someone gets hooked and soon after you have spine chill light up you know the guy probably has BBQ and now you have a few extra seconds to run. You wouldnt replace it for an exhaustion perk or anything.
---
It’s more so catered towards killers imo, if there isn’t people wanting to play killer the game completely dies. 
---
Look at all the patch notes over the course of 7 or 8 months. Primarily survivor nerfs while killer gets buffed, fixed, reworked or unchanged.
---
I play average size killers so theres no need
---
Eh, I like Warden better, well more like it was easier for me to do stuff for him
---
I wasn't t downplaying your win, just saying that if you get creative with traps you can work around the strongest loops in the map but it's still hard to win in it as killer.
---
They do not
---
i never play wraith. hes only good if u have best add ons and i dont have any. i play plague or nurse
---
Lol I’m pretty sure hitboxes will be fixed after we get dedicated servers. So it’ll only take another 3 years
---
season 4 hype
---
Hmmm. How laggy were those games?
---
From my experience they do.
---
Lmao 😂
---
I made some stuff up for the Panzersoldat. His whole power revolves around a bunch of things he could do on DE and Origins. Perks were alright, just named them after Easter Egg songs and called it a day. 
---
I also made some perks for the Richtofen that died in Blood of the Dead
---
Dbd porn
---
No mic communication in SWF.
---
Rank resets and being a killer main.  Id only play enough to get around rank 10 before getting thrown back to 15.
---
Getting to rank 8 was the most I ever tried, I wanted to go as high as I could before hitting this 1000 mark. 
---
Turns out, I hit a wall where I just couldn't do enough for the system. There was a lot of 0 pip games and a -1 for every +1.
---
But now that I missed the mark and couldn't hit rank 1, maybe I'll just finish off the hex achievement and just do whatever I feel like from now on.
---
See the thing is that I NEVER play killer. I play wraith and get all 4 survivors every time. Probs only played 6-8 times with him but always got everyone. I just think being invisible for as long as you want is to OP
---
Hold up why is Feng kinda swole
---
Tbh full support for the Xbox one x and PS4 pro 
---
Because I love my xbox one x
---
I just love these!! So stylish and creepy!
---
I was the Ghostface on the right. Also I want this to be an official game mode
---
This is why whenever its egc and the killer camps i have my friends save with BT and I run DS, so I can teabag at the gate to crush their spirit and discourage camping
---
Adam's DC because if they dont get deliverance they get tunneled.
---
Source: tunnel and am tunneled vs and playing as Adam respectively.
---
WHERE IS THIS FROM
---
How does it look different from the screens
---
We’ve come far bois
---
Play the game to memorize the maps and watch survivor youtubers like ussylis and tru3 who play optimally to learn how to run the tiles, although tru3 is more of a killer player
---
Please give this man 5 awards
---
As a Dwight player (when playing with friends) I can say that killers love Dwight
---
Yea ur right the only unfair thing about bubba is when he camps its impossible to save
---
In the menu screen it looks very shiny like fresh blood, but in a trial it looks dull and faded, like its dried up. It’s a very noticeable difference unfortunately
---
My mask just disappeared on me today. rip.
---
PS4 can have cross play for all devs now.
---
whining? No I'm showing off a general bug in the ranking system (for the people who still care cuz it seems not many do) and all I'm getting is shit from people like you who only see that one perk that for some unexplained reason is related? because I'm literally only getting comments about noed.
---
There was a game I plaued where it was me and one other dude left alive with one gen left. I was distracting for a solid 4 minutes until I finally got down. The other dude was just sitting by the hatch the whole time.
---
Get the same feeling when I pull someone out of a locker from Feral Frenzy. They didn't think you could do it, until you did it to em.
---
How would u even do this, discord is a third party application
---
That's very nice, i-wanna-fuck-trapper!
---
There are mainly survivor nerfs because for a long time survivors were the power role in the game. Killers were severely underpowered against all the tools that survivors have had. Many things have needed to be fixed to get the game where it is. Now that it's in a semi balanced state, we'll most likely be seeing balancing on both sides, hence the nurse nerf we are seeing now.
---
and the other half thinks the entire game is just looping the killer over and over again so when they play vs killers like spirit that require stealth play they fly on here to complain 8^)
---
i don’t use ruin bb ❤️
---
i don't have facebook so to me they don't exist
---
more like Laurie since she has Decisive strike
---
Omfg this is so fucking cute!!! I love it!
---
I also like myers a lot :), nice drawing! Hope to see more of your projects soon
---
Funny, because I literally never mentioned the fact that I even give a remote shit that you run NOED, but sure, 'people like you who only see one perk'. People have given you solutions, play the game longer, that's all. And yet, you still complain about a few people mentioning NOED, if they annoy you that much, just ignire them, honest to god.
---
What is this, rank 20 shit?
---
I can confirm
---
Oh I see i could do with both dry and wet blood
---
Anyone else hate the Balanced Landing icon? If anybody landed like that their leg would snap
---
Lolwut
---
Wow the middle schoolers are out in force today with these pathetic excuses for insults like I havnt heard that ad nauseum since I was in my early teens when Xbox live came out.
---
How does it feel to get so angry and pissy about *free content* for a video game? Go outside child, smell the roses, get off the internet and find something better than crying on the internet because your free content is just a *wittle late for the babys*
---
You can still use it on Sheltered Woods.
---
Oh lord she comin
---
Yeah it’s annoying. Best Trapper mask imo, and to have it and then not is dumb
---
Depends on a number of things really
---
Seriously every time I'm doing an action that possibly has a skill check it scares me to take my hand away from the controller for even a split 2nd to scratch my balls
---
People never learn, they still buy Early Access games that will never leave it or buy obvious asset flips like Atlas.
---
That's the gaming industry. I honestly lost all faith in it and I don't see it get any better, especially given the fact kids grow up with this kind of bullshit nowadays.
---
Oh look, more from the "survivor's rulebook on playing killer"
---
i go to scratch my balls and all of the sudden i see a ghostface pop out of the corner and grab me
---
The only reason I even started leveling up jake was for this skin specifically (pretty mad about the event being postponed but whatever they gotta do)
---
You should make it a shirt
---
Ranking system is fucked, that's it.

---
I main survivor, but I also play killer. I didn't have friends when I only played as survivor on PS4, but now on PC I have lots of buddies. :D Just choose a different platform!
---
It just stands out a lot? So a lot of people will notice it? Because it draws a lot of attention? Unless attention is what you wanted?
---
*Valak
---
Hold on what does Freddy like agai- oh NO
---
I'd be down for early November because birthday money if I get any.
---
Its fine for hitboxes to be off because they benefit the killer.
---
What do you mean underrated lol?? The tier lists I see posted here put it at S tier. Every survivor group I play against as a red rank killer uses it.
---
SWF &gt; killer &gt; solo
---
Mind if I get the source image?
---
I always feel bad for the poor chaps but seriously bruh we need to spread out stop following me
---
I agree, what makes demo unfair? He’s B tier at best
---
I get it. They are working hard. A ridiculous amount of bugs is not intentional. They wanted this event to be on time. They are probably nice people too. I understand that.
---
The problem is, they are REALLY bad at their jobs. It’s not like I hate them or something, I just don’t think they are capable of meeting the minimum level of quality.
---
I have mad the big brain play of binding the skill check button to one of the buttons on the side of my mouse. I can use my phone in one hand and hit mediocre skillchecks with the other
---
your visualization of working on a generator is actually the best thing
---
Spine Chill is super good, it's concrete, no failure info. Is the killer near your?  Is he looping around you?  Is he in chase still?  All info that is helpful. 
---
Urban is OK but is a bit too passive sometimes.
---
David and Jake are implied to be good friends with each other. At least judging by artworks, they  hang out with each other.
---
I use the M4 as the skillcheck button, no more headscratching shenanigans for you, entity
---
No, it’s *bestiality*, because it’s the best
---
I’d make 
---
EVERY MAP DARKER
---
Every map is so bright, and takes away any horror that could be had.
---
5 isn't balanced. 4 forces you to make hard decisions.
---
It's truly funny how killers are always like "SuRvIvOr HaNdBoOk" 
---
Yet....
---
Bring toolbox, we tunnel. Use flashlight, we camp. Bring key, we face camp. Loop us, we are tunneling. Scoops Ahoy Steve, we mori. Look like swf, we mori. Break ruin before someones hooked, we dc. Like um, okay. 
---
Opposed to survivors saying, don't camp and tunnel. Lololololol.
---
Literally had it happen to me today. Spirit camped and tunneled and claimed it was because she didn't want to be genrushed. "genrushed" is a poor excuse for not pressuring the map. people only get a chance to work on gens uninterrupted if you don't try to interrupt them.
---
More please OuO
---
"My totems! My *pretty* totems!" -Some witch from hearthstone.

Well in defense of OP the devs could have been less vague and maybe told us that the event was postponed LITERALLY A DAY BEFORE THE EVENT IS SCHEDULED cause that would have been pretty nice
---
lol poor winny died in a recent south park episode. they should change it to where 3 survivors is acceptable
---
But you get looped trough the ENTIRE tier 3
---
oh this is perfect!
---
nevermind your first comment was from commenting on noed not worth my time I thought you were someone else.
---
this is one for the MLG sniper montage.
---
How did you make the commanda icon stay on the weapon like that? and did you find the icon with transparent background or did you have to cut the icon away from its background? (when in editing i mean)
---
I've bought every DLC up to date and am considering quitting once the Battle Pass comes out. I honestly can't believe the greed.  
---
I figured the in-game cosmetics and mandatory purchases for licensed killer would be enough money for them.
---
wat
---
golden clip
---
It was because of unforseen circumstances so they didnt want to elaborate before they knew what was really happening
---
Please do clown or nurse next
---
I'm not that great, but I love this game, only bad players I run into are way lower when I havemt played in awhile.
---
Howie as survivor DLC when BHVR?
---
This used to be a D&amp;D meme, didn't it?
---
Well actually that’s a fair point but still maybe they could have been a little less vague about the unforeseen circumstance (still a bit mad about the postponement sorry)
---
Also if using this build you shouldn't complain about anything the survivors bring against you that game.
---
Absolutely amazing
---
Bad example but point still stands can’t ignore/exclude an entire platform
---
This is why i have all my skill checkes maped to m1+m2
---
Reminds me of super mario sunshine
---
EXACTLY! More people play killer than survivor anymore,  that's why they now have more of a wait time than us. I mean, I play both but way more survivor. 
---
I put in streamers the other day, just for the killer to camp and mori everyone off the hook. He only got like 17k WITH streamers, like why would you wanna do that? Oh yeah, just to fucking ruin the other sides fun. Lol. There is so much toxic in this game it's insane, I feel like a killer actually playing to have fun is rare anymore. 
---
But it doesn't help that survivors like to taunt when they have a better game, or a escape. I was playing a relaxed game as killer, just wanted some bloodpoints because I'm working on leveling up Micheal so I was the Wraith. I can easily get 4ks with him, but tonight I was struggling. Lol. I admit. I chase this Feng around and she is good, so it sucked tonight is my off night. So I leave her, like okay you won that chase. So what does she do? Non stop vaults, t bags and tries to flashlight me lol. So I do the only thing I can do, let them pop the last gen, down a shitty survivor, and let them open the exit before I hook her.. Allow my blood warden to go off and walk over to find the t bagging Feng in the exit. I sure did face camp her, and make sure no one could save her lol. When someone is having a shit game and is getting taunted for it, it causes toxicity on both sides.
---
Just imagine MM doing that sprinkler stab across the map...
---
You mean for PC? They still get average 15,000-30,000 players a day according to steam charts.
---
This is the only sprint perk where a killer can't counter it via play. Either the map allows you to use it well as survivor or it doesn't. I can hold off on swings for DH, force pops of SB, and lithe needs a bit of setup. This this just pays dividends for days. I know in likely in for skilled chases when I see balanced.
---
oh really. remember that hollow blight thing? Man it strange we dont have anything like that this year huh.
---
Same here, minus the language barrier thing.
---
&gt;if you read my posts
---
All of them, not the one about Doc.
---
Ofc you can get to r1 with Doc. You can with anyone. He's still a trashcan and unfun to play as or against (especially on console.)
---
I love these so much. Thank you for your excellent art contributions! :D
---
Yeah but you still exclude them if they excluded your console of choice I assume you would be pretty peeved off
---
It's always Bubba's game don't you forget or I'll remind you for 2 minutes
---
the killer was a spirit. still have no idea how i got hit.
---
There are plenty of abusive add ons. I.e. prayer beads and iri heads.
---
I'd like to see a series of these.  You should consider making more.  It's a cool concept.
---
Have you ever played claudette and see the killer so you hide in a corner that's so overwhelmingly lit up just for the killer to walk past you
---
Last night I decided to play few games after work, haven't played survivor since the weekend (busy practicing killers), 3 games in a row was left to die on 1st hook after risking myself helping others during endgame :)))))). Rank 10 btw
---
I enjoy making DBD fan art in general :) Do you mean my experiences in-game and/or the characters doing "normal" stuff? :)
---
All killers would be 95% and have powers that required skill to use and have counter play
---
Can I just say that I love these and can't wait for the demogorgon one lol
---
Killer sided overall. More fun too.
---
Like this exact concept the whole Halloween Party dress up angle of various survivors hanging out dressed up as killers.  There's so many combinations to  choose from I'd be interested in seeing more for sure.
---
18k*2 from bloody party streamer+9k from bbq

You have to play with friends to know the difference. Personally, I don't like playing swf, I tend to troll without meaning to, and depip because of it. But, playing swf is way more coordinated and less stressful compared to solo queue. Solo q is a gamble, you either go in with extremely good survivors or bad ones. Nothing in between.
---
its fine i can handle it, i just wanna bring attention to it so some people are aware an can make the neccesary steps to do so
---
I would probably say I'm a killer main before survivor, but I play both roles mostly even. Solo queue of course, I usually hold my own, sometimes I feel like I'm doing more than the other 3, and other times everyone dies and I grit my teeth and think "oooh, yep, that MIGHT'VE been my fault..."
---
oh i know. if I see survivors t bagging the killer my desire to help them off a hook goes down. i am always one of the "gate is open but I am going to check on the others" kind of player.  gets me killed 4 out of 5 times but I'm never mad about that because I made that choice.
---
face camping means that i and other survivors can't play the game we're all trying to enjoy and just feels hateful. "BuT i'M kIlLeR" is a shit excuse for being an prick
---
Personally, I think a original killer this time around would be best. We just got 2 licensed killers in a row. I think a new BHVR created one next is probably ideal. However, if it is a liscensed killer, I hope its Jason or chucky. Been wanting them in dbd for years now.
---
You must have played with me a lot
---
The perk is hope, "don't do that, don't give me hope" you'd have to of watched Avengers Endgame, looked up the memes for it, and played a lot of DBD to get it so don't worry
---
You monster
---
don't give me (perk name= Hope)
---
An option to cancel an unhook so fuckfaces cant ruin my round
---
Campers dont care about points, otherwise they wouldn't camp. Camping in general is shit points because you're not doing anything and you're not hooking multiple times, getting chase points, getting hit points, etc.
---
This is correct but people would rather make excuses than find flaws in their own gameplay lol
---
Same. Die more than I escape but I still always pip or double pip and my rank stays under 5 and I don't have to be a toxic jerk to win. always say gg or compliment the killer unless they were toxic. then it's "wish I had brought marshmallows if we were gonna camp"
---
"bUt DeY WeRe CaMpINg rEsCuE"
---
"no, you have rank 1 bbq and chili and they were too far out of your range. did you enjoy all the negative bp?" because I am the kind of passive aggressive that will signal the camping so ppl keep working gens and then killers get salty they got "rushed" because they waited for 2 gens to pop before they leave the hook
---
Exit Gate spawns need to be fixed too.
---
Sacrifices dont work. You have to mori them 25 times to unlock them.
---
Leave it to Feng to have the laziest cosplay.
---
I am in LOVE with these, this is amazing!
---
Gotta watch for spine chill
---
Honestly, the only time I'm ever gonna let a survivor escape is if they boop the snoot.
---
*laughs in Doctor and door patrol*
---
so true
---
I blame this on the "fuck you" points we get now. If I let survivors go nowadays, it's via the exit gates. I want my hatch closed points.
---
Hmm. Maybe a dedicated servers bug? Or even because of the gen grab?
---
You also could just  n o t  b u y  i t
---
I dont ready up becauss I'm too busy getting something to eat that's in the kitchen (usually a banana or raw onion),  going to the bathroom,  or getting water. I'd rather do that before the game starts than during the game. Luckily I have never run into killers who mori players that don't readg up.
---
I don’t even know what you’re talking about. You have to do so goddamn much to pip up in red rank. It’s actually insane that you think it’s that easy.
---
Intentional.
---
I just want my ghostface outfit and I'll be happy
---
by default it is
---
He’s speaking the language of the gods!
---
*Like that's ever gonna happen* I was just saying they need to fix spawn points on alot of things. Kinda fells like the devs don't care.
---
My theory is that Gen grabs are faster so you have more time to drop them before the skillcheck happens. Then when dropping them, they will hit the skillcheck at the end of the animation basically wasting it
---
It's only bad due to the balanced landing buff. If everyone broke their ankles on every fall the map wouldn't be nearly as strong for survivor. Currently its the strongest map for survivors with BL.
---
The difference is barely noticeable so don't do it unless you want the bloody clothes.
---
Part of the reason I'm going for cute, I feel like there's already enough negativity here. I just wanna enjoy the game :')
---
You loose perks and items and offerings
---
But hey you get a cool bloody 
---
Face
---
Shirt
---
Legging
---
Worth it right?.........
---
for me, doesn’t matter how long it’s been since a skill check, the second i go to strategy my balls “dunnnnnn”
---
Once I told my baby teammates (profiles had less than 24 hours playtime) I would tbag to keep the killer on my ass all game. Killer ended up being AFK all game. :(
---
Thanks, I'll try to keep em coming!
---
Well dang.  I dont know if I will then. 
---
I wouldn't care about losing my perks, but losing my items sounds like shit.
---
I mean the only "powers" you can buy are the licensed Killers and none of them are really that good besides Freddy. Michael is pretty shit after Dedicated Servers fucked up his stalk, Bubba has always been a meme and unusable outside the basement, Pig's okay but suffers the same problems every other Killer does, Ghostface just sucks in general, Freddy is great now but suffers the same problems every other Killer does, and Demogorgon's pounce is a joke alongside his portals since they can just be torn up as soon as he leaves.

Never expect a killer to be nice to you because usually people who sit at the exit gates and heals/stay there they are being toxic.
---
You're really fighting an uphill battle here, buddy. Might be time to accept that you're wrong and take a knee.

Yep, she was just crouching. But I'm a scared little kate so I still tried to flee whoops

Playing survivor is literal trash right now. I don’t think I’ve ever played against such unfun killers before. and sound isn’t working on the killer end. Game is janky as fuck
---
He doesn’t risk his life for anyone. He was with the rest of the crew for a long time. In a realm with a bunch of new random ass people where death isn’t an escape you can bet your ass Bill will give no fucks.
---
Now THAT'S a cute killer!
---
dont worry, nobodies thinking about you
---
haha thank you, I'm still a beginner though!
---
u have to expect ruin, billy, spirit and nurse. Ruin is almost required against most teams at red ranks unless u play scummy and slug people constantly then u could do it without ruin. Same goes with the 3 killers listed people use them because they are top tier killers and as I previously stated against high ranked survivors it gives u a chance to win rather than playing someone like the wraith and getting bullied. now granted u can still 4k with the wraith in high ranks but it will just be super stressful.
---
I loooveee iiiiit. How do I buy a print of this 😍?
---
t h i s   i s    n o t    a   f t p    g a m e

ohhhh tell me! Mine was like a month ago already, do you play on pc?
---
You are literally repeating the same comeback in every comment you type. Let it go man you aren’t being ‘personally attacked’ you are calling people whack for making a joke which wasn’t even aimed at you. We get that you didn’t get the joke so there’s no need to have a go at anyone for typing it.
---
Last one is 100% your bad. Just get close enough to exit to crawl out. 
---
The rest happen. It's just the state of this poorly balamced game.
---
I honestly can never leave Xbox because of my Gamerscore. I'd be too sad to leave it behind lol
---
Cool dude, no one's forcing you to buy it lol. It's there for people like me who have sunk literally thousands of hours into the game and done everything there is to do and want something fresh.
---
I will do it eventually..  just not any time soon. Sounds like a nightmare having to get these items back.
---
Why do you keep saying gen rush? You are acting like that’s toxic it’s just them doing the objective the flashlight and teabagging I get I just don’t understand why you being up gen rush like it’s as bad as them
---
The best? Idk. All the exhaustion perks are very strong in different situations. Like I would say dead hard is the best, but its absolutely useless if you're caught wide out in the open.
---
Love these!
---
Nsfw, Definitely getting positive vibes for spirit for the first time
---
add this to the list of cursed comments i've seen
---
Removed for unrelated to dead by daylight
---
Thanks for the heads up! You saying you never got positive vibes beforehand?
---
this game is survivor sided. Once u hit red ranks with killer and survivor u will understand how much harder the killer side has because gens can literally go in 4 minutes. now people will say to this argument "just pressure gens" and this may be true to an extent but on most maps which are large u have little to no chance depending on what killer u are which only 4 killers have mobility the other 12 do not have mobility and will almost always lose on these maps especially if u get group of decent survivors they dont even have to be god tier just decent. (just know that this only applies at the highest level of play. I do feel the games decently balanced in green and above ranks)
---
Good for talking it out instead of berating each other! Most killers aren't necessarily evil, just frustrated from other matches/survivors, I'm glad you got him to apologize!
---
Yeah i really hate those vile creatures, but i would still say rapists are worse.
---
The generator, we fully repaired it but the notif still shows 5gens to complete
---
Well sadly we couldn't find out because its a p3 spirit with prayer beads :/
---
I do!
---
+1
---
haha don't worry. I just call myself mediocre because I'm a beginner and know there's a lot to learn. The community has been overwhelmingly positive and welcoming actually! &lt;3
---
How is "X" considered a hug 🤔
---
Pigs are cool players imo, though they're basically the fair furries of the community
---
Love the art style!!
---
god fucking damnit
---
Maybe at some point when I know I can be consistent, and when I know how that actually works lol
---
I understand the other two is playstyle preference. But what's wrong with Spine Chill?
---
I really like this “EC comic” style
---
A spirit got greedy after she downed me, went after someone else. I crawled all the way to a corner just hoping to be in an area with less hooks, heard the hatch nearby... then also heard the heartbeat. It was in one of those circles of trees and rocks and tall grass. I managed to JUST crawl out of sight as she came around the rock... and slip right on into the hatch just as she came around to see me go in. I clipped it cause I thought it was real dang lucky haha
---
nah, I'm gonna share the cute experiences whether you like it or not!
---
haha thank you! \^\^
---
They all ran out of the gate, I watched them, two were in the clear but the others had traps on.
---
Awesome I love it 😍
---
fair enough!
---
At this point I wouldn't be surprised if the devs actually did that, they do everything they can to fuck over the, supposed to be, powerrole KILLER! Why is OoO a thing? Why are 4 dstrikes allowed? How many fucking pallet and loops can you give them?... Smh
---
I makes you wonder what's going through their head.
---
\&gt;The killer is letting me cleanse their totem
---
\&gt;The killer is Spirit
---
\&gt;Ruin is *not* in play
---
Better finish cleansing this obviously-not-trapped totem!
---
maybe just rework it so that it acts like actual adrenaline. after starting a chase get minor haste for x seconds, sounds of pain grunting is reduced for x seconds after getting hit ect.
---
I did buy a switch just for dbd - was fun for a bit - lost interest because i started at 0, everybody was rank 20 regardless of skill (bug) and you have to pay extra for online play (im from older gaming gens where consoles charging for multiplayer wasnt a thing)
---
it feels like it did playing in 2017 tbh. if youre nostalgic thats a good thing
---
That's why it surprised me so much, I know you guys hate keys. I'd expected for her to at least go for an extra kill, but this was a welcome surprise :')
---
fair enough
---
It’s surprisingly great on switch. I was a PS4 player and got it on the switch just because I have so much down time at work and it’s my favorite game. Now I only play on the switch. My main use is for working out. I put the switch on the treadmill, one joycon in each hand, and it makes time fly by. Graphic downgrade isn’t as bad as you’d think. Definitely worth it for the portability. I had put a lot of hours into my ps4 profile,  but it was worth it to shift over. Hopefully that helps your thinking a bit!
---
what bug?
---
&gt; I put them on and they were flashing as they do when their ticking I suppose cause when they aren’t ticking it’s just solid and not flashing. Either way its BS, if the game says they’ll die with it on then they should, no if, ands or buts. Unless there’s some specific way and yes I watched them race pass the barrier that stops me and I was utter discontent.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; I was also teabagged and blinded too, not that it matter, just toxic.
---
If the trap was put after the last gen got done, they can walk through the exit gates just fine.
---
If the trap was put before, they escaped through hatch.
---
cursed_gen
---
Yeah I guess I just don’t remember it being that way? I rarely go against the pig anymore though and I only play her with splinters or whatever they’re called. I swear though that when she would put the rbt on you after the final gen that it would automatically be activated but maybe I’m just misremembering.
---
You just have to move on from a rough game like that. This game brings out the worst in people sometimes. Everyone trying to let out their rage by trolling. Idk. I don't get but I don't let it get to me. Play a survivor game to cool your head and then get back to killing the fools.
---
Stonetoss is a nazi and there are tons of identical formats to get this same point across
---
&gt; I swear though that when she would put the rbt on you after the final gen that it would automatically be activated but maybe I’m just misremembering.
---
They changed that when EGC was introduced.
---
Don’t know where you live in but not all rapists are pedophiles but all pedophiles are rapists (due to age of consent) in Canada. So yeah, pedophiles are probably worse for more reasons...
---
Prestige 3. It means they leveled to rank 50 thrice
---
Nope. I had a PS4, but now I exclusively play on switch. Graphics to me are not a huge  difference, but I’ve been pretty lucky trying to rank up my switch profile to get to where I was on PS4.
---
Oh ok that makes sense then
---
The RBT’s only activate when a generator is completed while wearing them. If they aren’t they cannot kill you. It’s not BS, it’s fair
---
Imagine being so delusional that you view critiquing an openly racist holocaust denier  as virtue signaling instead of a moral obligation.
---
Jesus fucking Christ I hate this timeline
---
Well well well, if it isn't the invisible cunt player
---
Jk! That's actually quite the achievement mate, good on ya
---
They clearly weren't activated then.
---
I never understood why last survivors never wiggle, why is it? Is it just a last plea for life?
---
Huntress lullaby really screws you over in those kinds of situations tho
---
I think last year was the Summer BBQ/Margarita thing, which we didn’t get this year.
---
Yeah, I figured he thought my terror radius was from me still being by the hook, but that's mitigated by not being an idiot and just looking around and noticing the TR is closer and in a diff direction 😂
---
4m if u bring dead rabbit actually
---
&gt; I wasn't t downplaying your win,
---
I didn't even take it that way. I get what you meant. :)
---
bruh the one on the left looks like a sim with HD graphics
---
dead rabbit is 4m so ur have a 4m terror radius because (m&amp;a = 8, dead rabbit = 4, 16-8-4=4m
---
I’ll have you know that I’ve never teabagged a killer in my entire life.
---
~ signed, a Nea main.
---
I was implying something much more degenerate but that works too.
---
Huntress is very unfair. Sometimes you’ll hit a survivor with a hatchet that clearly missed, and sometimes hatchets go straight through survivors.
---
From the standpoint of describing the weather, I feel that Fahrenheit is superior because you get a more precise idea of how hot or cold it feels to our bodies. For chemistry or any scientific application, Celsius or kelvin all the way.
---
I was on the hatch with the pig and a gen was close to I went and did it for extra points after about 3 mins and he came over prob to try to pull me off so I gen tap the thing got it done teabagged for fun then ran to the hatch and the pig DC lol
---
I do not envy the devs who are gonna be on that stream. I know most of the community is ready to burn them alive and I already can feel the chat logs getting spammed with hate flame and “Unforseen Circumstances” 
---
Godspeed to whoever has to stand in front of that camera.
---
Yeah, I’m a Biochem student planning to go to med school so it’s more practical in my own life to use Celsius.
---
Fool, survivors are not the enemy. The entity is! We must fight the entity together!
---
It’s kind of like having a Christmas event which starts on Boxing Day, you don’t celebrate Christmas really after the 25th like how you don’t celebrate Halloween after the 31st.

He is daddy, just look under ;)

I like to let people go if i felt I had fun and they did too. Or if i feel bad for something unlucky happening to them.

Also happy cake day

STBFL is very underrated on M1 killers
---
it was like that but no one liked it so they changed it to this. I think they should give users an option so those who want to keep playing the game even though one leaves can go ahead and do that so everyone is happy
---
Great scene
---
Yep he is and maybe I’ll look for other things that isn’t too much like shirtless Myers
---
Is that guy fucking autistic??
---
Love his 12 foot lunge
---
Burger King Myers
---
You know that’s his goal in life
---
Predator looking kinda cute 😳
---
What bug? Never heard of this
---
Slug the last 2 
---
People may hate it, but that’s the only 4K guarantee
---
Nice one bro.
---
Hacevyoubtried Nea? That Urnan Evasion is helpful because you move at walking speed in stealth
---
Who says I’m gay?
---
that I am not sure I just know it is available in different places sadly not my location though
---
tackle is actually amazing
---
but it's a dice roll, which can cause the effects of them from game to game to be drastically inconsistent. You could have a whole game with ruin up or get a survivor spawning on it, the hex perks, and ruin even more so, are big gambles that can be very annoying for one side or the other.
---
There was an exploit that allowed people to prestige characters a while ago on console,  
---
Didn't harm the game it was just cosmetics. But bevhr was like nah ban em all 
---
Fun times people did get their shit rest somewhat meh lolol
---
I love this... "Makes a mess" lol
---
Relatable
---
There’s a trick I do if I haven’t seen the killer all game and neither have my teammates, I got up to a door, turn my volume up super high and you can usually hear the nurse breathing.
---
It's supposed to represent arms going across someone's back. O represents kiss hence why love letters have "XOXO" in them. It means hugs and kisses
---
I, can’t argue with that
---
I was playing solo and when I qued up I got an invitation from one of the survivors but didn't think much. Throughout the game, they would alert the killer to my location by vaulting, dropping pallets or simply bringing him to me. The killer was in the same party as them and was helping them get points. Is there a way to get them banned besides reporting them and just waiting?
---
Isn’t deliverance bugged right now? I once had a safe hook, the perk was lit. And I attempted hook 3 times and didn’t get it, next game I attempted and on my second attempt deliverance proccd
---
Playing The Clown without exhaustion bottles on Haddonfield (or any map altogether) is like shooting yourself on foot.
---
Been thinking of running it myself. Seeing how quickly most get back into the chase is almost scary.
---
new legion skin
---
Well, i AM a bit chubs so deal with it
---
It was coldwind and it did have a Kate, but I couldn't tell you in terms of server region. Mine sometimes tells me I'm playing from Australia, though I've never altered the files or anything like that. I think it's just my PC being dumb
---
No, he's clearly talking about the clown
---
I purposefully take off ruin because I get a string of games against babies, but then randomly out of nowhere I get matched with purple ranks multiple times when I am still rank 13 and get annihilated. FML.
---
Stockholm syndrome is when a person starts sympathizing with their kidnapper and has nothing to do with games
---
Report and send a vid of the match
---
Who is the 4th one over?
---
Unfortunately I can't since my clip only recorded 2 minutes which just showed me reporting them.
---
Trying to open a sliding door with a kitchen knife, never thought I’d see that
---
Running spine chill for prayer beads spirit is like running slippery meat for trapper.
---
Then I’d say your SOL buddy
---
Ps4 records 15min tho?
---
If you want someone to play with, feel free to DM me if you want to. I’ve got a couple friends I play with too.
---
I know some people enjoy solo, but I’m not a huge fan.
---
The one for Myers is pretty accurate.
---
I'm so confused. Does anyone now when the Halloween Event will start?
---
Why not beat them to the punch?
---
When it's rock'o'clock.
---
like nuzzling into your foreskin and then making a vommy balloon with it until it pops
---
pretty sure that's so you can't 4 man with purple tombstone
---
Or you can assume that they have it because everyone has BBQ, and stay on the gen until you hear a heartbeat. You don't need spine chill to tell you that the killer is coming unless it's a stealth killer, and even then simple awareness and pre-planning does the same thing without sacrificing a perk slot.
---
I clicked it and immediately started to regret it.
---
thanks so much!
---
Otz is basically as good maybe better OhTofu without the patronizing comments every vid
---
Don't know if you know this, but it might be because the killer has a perk called tinkerer, which drops their terror radius to 0 for like 12 seconds or so when a generator reaches 85% progress. And since you mentioned hillbilly, and it's a hillbilly perk, that seems the most likely. Apart from that, I've never had or heard of this bug.
---
Every dang time.
---
Just let yourself die honestly. I love a good farm every now and again and I respect people who don't want to do that. But seriously don't go out of your way to get them banned, it's already super hard to pair with someone you know so maybe just let them have this one
---
sometimes I’ll go for a scratch just for the thrill of it
---
Most high rank players consider BL to be, depending on map, the best perk in the game. There's a reason streamers like Scottjund and Zubat have a literal list of players who burn Haddonfield offerings with BL so they can mori them on sight. It creates literal infinites on certain maps.
---
What?
---
Now that’s a man of culture.
---
I feel this is one of the easier maps to 3 gen strat on, if you’re that type of killer. I don’t particularly mind it as killer, and as survivor (if you’re playing with anything less than experts for teammates or just going solo) it can become hard to spread the gens out. 
---
I don’t know, it’s not my favorite map, but I don’t think it’s god awful. I’m no expert though.
---
I imagine any software developer has all of their machines on a UPS
---
If you want to rework a survivor sided map why not mention haddonfield?
---
Tf kind of instrument he got?
---
OP WHAT COUNTRY R U IN
---
Triple tbh
---
It's just godawful to play against regardless of survivor perks. So many bullshit fences that take 8 years to catch up on with no counterplay other than just to keep running around it.
---
I had the bug, but I do think he just went against Tinkerer.
---
No I dont
---
what if i did this for you     
---
haha just joking    
---
...unless?
---
I'll play it most of the time if I roll it randomly, but if someone burns an offering I'll either DC and take the double depip, or face camp anyone who abuses the Meyer's building with BL.
---
But you derank from leaving anyway don’t you
---
This isn't call of duty, tomahawks don't bounce
---
I've been really lucky to have met great positive gamers cuz I've heard of horror stories from gaming experiences. Specifically for female gamers but it is getting better slightly.
---
This keeps happening to me literally every match I play it'll start to drop to 5 frames and then freeze before disconnecting me
---
you forgot to shorten the length of events!
---
It's situational, but being together makes it much easier for the killer to disrupt gen progress, and keep tabs on the survivors' locations
---
Apparently as easy as getting a killer and "secretly" farming. I'm running into more of those fuckers than I'm comfortable with mentioning
---
Does seem the key needs an animation. Least then if you have a key, you hide and wait for the killer to leave the hatch before opening it again. Though I imagine this is one of those times people would also say "Should have brought franklins"
---
i actually am trying to hover around rank 8 myself. i’ve heard how hard it is to get into lobbies, games are all the same, killers/survs run the same perks etc. at red ranks. but i think getting to rank one would be a good achievement.
---
Amanda was always a survivor at the start
---
Just started playing in the single digit ranks and the game is completely different. Some games are great with a lot of fun and good laughs, most though are toxic SWF groups. If they lose, it’s because I was lucky and I’m bad. If they win, gg ez game - uninstall noob. 
---
If I didn’t have to queue for ranked games, I wouldn’t. Unfortunately, I don’t have that option.
---
‘Summer Event in december’
---
So, we’re gonna get Frozen DCL?
---
like a survivor and a killer farming together but not making it obvious?
---
Bad manners
---
Hag has really good scare potential. Only killer that makes me jump once in a while.
---
I do think time spent on the game helps to improve you as a player, obviously, but just because you have spent time on the game does not automatically make you great. 
---
Once you understand the mechanics and how the game works, ranking up is not hard. You’ll get better at mind games, know when to stay or hop off gens, what are the best perks to use, etc. But just because you can do all that, doesn’t mean you’re significantly better than a purple rank player or something like that. 
---
I’ve been playing DBD for two years, and it took me two months to hit red ranks, and I have hit red rank every month since then. Yet I’ve admitted many times that I am far from the best player on DBD. I suck as and against Spirit. I’m mediocre playing as Billy, and can’t juke his chainsaw for shit. Ranking up does require some basic skill and time investment, but it isn’t hard to do once you understand how the game works if you’re a moderately decent player.
---
That said, being in a different rank than someone doesn’t mean you know better than them. You can understand how the game works and just suck in pressure situations. It doesn’t make your opinion any less valid. You could say something that is wrong, sure, but I have red rank friends that say stupid shit about the game all the damn time. Even if it should, your rank does not define you as a player. There are great red rank players, and there are potatoes. I’ve matched with green and purple rank survivors that actually did pretty good. 
---
It’s about the player, not the arbitrary number.
---
They've stated they never said this event would have double BP.
---
I was really anticipating you stepping into a trap near the end.
---
Not a furry but I do main amanda and my twitch emote is her lol. Thank you for noticing a very small community of players just having fun!
---
Object of obsession!
---
I remember I did bad once and I got a toxic message from one of them calling me trash and trying to make me mad, but I am no soft person, so instead I started messaging them back acting as if I won and saying gg ez to them, they got so mad at me lol.
---
One random game a year ago i was a nea on the game and heard the terror radius and snuck over to cover and another nea did the same thing at the same time in the same cosmetics, as the heartbeat grew faster and slower as the killer moved i started bopping in beat with it amd she joined so then we ran around in circles together and finished the game.
---
We added on discord and shes one of my best friends now and we talk almost every day.
---
In your defense it does seem _very_ sarcastic lol
---
Oh? Well that's cool I've only prestige demo once and so I wasn't sure, good to know
---
Predator. Looking kinda 13
---
i guess so, i think the whole pressure situation thing might be something holding me back. honestly i do well against certain killers but pretty bad at others. at times i panic and don’t know where to go. i’m ok at juking/escaping and all that but sometimes i panic and over-achieve, getting caught at the window etc. maybe i’m just beating myself up.
---
tbh hearing that you got to red ranks in two months makes me feel like a potato lol.
---
Christmas in July
---
Sorry but what the heck are those black tendrils and how do I get them? They're so pretty
---
Bond, ds, exhaustion perk, Deliverance/kindred
---
I went up against a baby spirit that had Franklin's and Rancor I was the obsession but escaped somehow
---
I just bound the gen button to f, and items to e. Makes it easier to hit skill checks and my mouse hand is free to look around with no other task.
---
Im sure that exists of him too and I wouldnt be surprised in the fucking slighest.
---
David: I bet Nea told you to sandbag me after we’re done.
---
Dwight: no, no, no, I sandbag the bus looper...
---
I’ve tried, I can’t play games on keyboards, I don’t like my hands being cramped after playing. I wish it was that easy
---
That's why you do the claw grip while doing generators. I hold the controller in the middle with a finger on each shoulder
---
Hol’ up
---
I've played about 100 hours as killer and I gotta say sometimes what may appear as camping, is the survivor just not being too aware of their surroundings. I've had games where I'll chase people all the way across the map, then turn around and the same survivor I've downed and hooked just running right out in the open. And I think "so I'm supposed to let that person run around and do generators/heal for a minute + to avoid being accused of tunneling/camping." I usually just say fuck it and slug them and then move on. I'm not going to make the game harder for myself so someone else can feel better about themselves for being bad.
---
Not saying I've never been toxic. If people are being dumb I'll throw it right back. I'll occasionally throw out the "GGEZ thanks for the BP farm" even when all survivors survive. It's fun to see them get super defensive and up in arms. Even though it should be obvious when 4 survivors survive it's a joke, but holy crap the salt it generates.
---
It’s awesome on Demogorgon. You can shred the obsession so you don’t lose stacks.
---
twist:
---
the trapper actually saw you but decide to let you have your fun because he know you are new :)

---
That legion is blessed
---
Just take some time to learn. Like I said, there’s still killers I’m awful against myself. I’m definitely a better looper and mind gamer than I am at juking, I still can’t 360 (I play on Xbox and it seems way easier to do it on PC). Don’t be too harsh on yourself, it can be frustrating but it just takes practice. 
---
Also, I got to red ranks so fast because I spent a lot of time on the game at that point. I was coming back from class and just going straight on DBD, only taking breaks to eat, shower, or go to the gym at my dorm. I really don’t recommend investing as much time into a game as I did lol
---
And you use Fragrant Tuft of Hair so the party never stops
---
I played game like cs and Pubg before so it was kinda second nature, but I can get how it would be uncomfortable.
---
adrenaline, ds, dead hard, and self care
---
4 man swf with toolboxes and prove thyself: am I a joke to you?
---
Yeah my teammates screwed both of us in that situation.
---
Laughs in br portuguese
---
I Got caught by a spirit that Was so bad that she didnt Know how to Mori me with the rancor so she hooked me and I escaped :')
---
Nah, this map is pretty balanced for both sides. If we talk about nerfing really survivor friendly map, we should talk about Haddonfield then. But as I know it will be reworked in future.

His streams are sometimes a bit toxic, but he seems to be a good guy.
---
Incredible stuff. I'd love to see more)))
---
HE IS H E R E!
---
In my experience getting to red ranks is not hard.
---
Before rank reset i got to rank 3 survivor and 4 killer without trying.
---
By that i mean i don't play serious builds, more often than not i run chest builds on my ace, or try to get the headon combo.
---
For killer i often play plague without addons, so blackpips are the norm even in a good game.
---
LoL Ghostface and Demo is not bad, get good please.

---
Does it? I took it at face value
---
Yeh well I do wanna do it
---
I really hate it when survivors follow me after I rescue them from a hook, and the killer picked the perfect timing to come back to hook. Like I get it, you need the heal and don’t want to get tunneled but if we split up it’s a 50/50 chance that they’ll go after me instead of you. Which would you rather have? The killer getting a chance to down one player and then immediately start chasing another survivor. Forcing a third survivor to stop working on a gen to come pick up that survivor. All the while hoping the killer doesn’t just pick you right back up and hook you again. Or would rather split up. Find a safe place to hide. Find a med kit or someone to heal you. Then again I’m still kind of new to the game, so I don’t know if my opinion is “valid” or not.
---
Haha thank you I saw sourdough and was inspired
---
Not me friend, other guy. The one with the blue name (besides yourself)
---
What if they did costumes of classic monsters like Frankenstein, Dracula, werewolves, etc...
---
Interesting kind of post. Gonna go with We're Gonna Live Forever.
---
Pro : Fookin' bloodpoints mate.
---
Con : ...That's it. Seriously tho, give that perk an additional feature. People who cry about that 16 to 4 perk comparasion and that BBQ "needs to be stronger" never understood that Survivors and Killers have different kinds of perks to begin with.
---
Why is the timer that long too? 2:30 isn’t threatening, and it has only ever been depicted as having a 60 second timer.
---
Omg you make me so happy about DBD... if only all the games went like yours.
---
I think that was a doge meme attempt. Unsure.
---
I see your how you would be *thinking*
---
Same :( people adds me but is hard for me to mantain a long casual conversation on English (I use it for meetings at work all the time but that's easier, just a couple of minutes talking and you are done) small talks make me really nervous so I just avoid it. Even though I would love to play SWF.
---
Against a camping bubba just accept that person is gone and do all the gens while he sits there staring at the person on the hook. Easy victory as long as you aren't the unlucky bastard who got caught first. Its a cold thing to do, but the alternative is walking right into what you know is a trap and dying.
---
Nope nope nope. 
---
Sorry I do like the idea but it seems like it could be very strong especially off the bat. 
---
It can also ruin a good survivor with good predictions. 
---
But I wouldn’t say no to a perk where you have to do something and you gain mms increase.
---
Nah, you don’t need a degree in calculus to find the bones. You need a PHD in calcium to find them.
---
Was that a meme though? I was under the impression that she was trying to reveal me. If it was a meme I sincerely apologize. As I do, in fact, like memes.
---
r/oinkers_  Approves!
---
Sell these my dude! I’d buy all of them!
---
Even though I run Sprint burst, poised, distortion and Spine Chill, I try to unhook survivors 80% of the time. Also, if I'm with someone injured when killer comes I try to lure him away :(
---
I think a 60 second timer for you to straight up die unless you can check at least 4 boxes scattered around the map is a little unfair.
---
Maybe if the key boxes were quicker to search the timer could be reduced
---
Oh no abel look behind you, oh God he can't hear us he's busy being the favorite brother
---
Then the sweaties would all play quick play and bring moris, instas, and all meta perks every game to try and dunk on the people who aren’t trying as hard.
---
I don’t get it
---
It's one of the killer sided ones. Just defend your side of the map.
---
I agree the middle can be gross tho
---
When you're not matchmaked with potatoes :
---
Kindred / Open Handed / Bond / Dead Hard, Balanced Landing or Adrenaline.
---
Kindred + Open Handed is absurdely powerful when playing with Survivors that actually give a damn about saving eachother and playing efficiently. Revealing the Killer in a 24 m radius around you aslong as you're hooked shouldn't be underestimated, especially since it also reveals the direction the Killer heads for if they actually don't stay in your facillity.
---
Bond is always useful and with the increased range Open Handed adds to it, it allows you to see Survivors across almost half the map. Their movement dont just give away where the Killer is currently at but also gives you a easy time to cooperate with teammate, heal them or simply get healed yourself.
---
Open Handed makes Kindred absurdely powerful. It's also nice to have for Bond, Survivors who run it aswell (which's quite likely as it is very popular) will definetly be grateful for that.
---
BL and DH are simply the superior exhaustion perks. If you aint that confident in your skills I'd recommend BL as it has a lower knowledge requierement in terms of usage.
---
Adrenaline is for you if you prefer to play safe, consistent and stealthy, evading chases at all costs. Just so there's no misunderstanding here, I'm implying that people who play more cautious tend to make it more likely to the endgame, which's where the perk will trigger in the first place. If it does, it's absurdely good.
---
When you're definetly matchmaked with potatoes :
---
Botany Knowledge / Dead Hard OR Balanced Landing / Adrenaline / Pharmacy (if you can't bring a Med-Kit) / Decisive Strike
---
I might make unusual recommendations all over but hear me out on that one.
---
Dead Hard and Balanced Landing ain't necessary to be explained again.
---
Botany is actually an insanely powerful perk, increasing your healing speed but also grants you 33% additional efficiency. Depending on the Med-Kit itself, this can actually be more than 2 entire heals. While toolboxes are appealing, Med-Kits are the absolute priority in terms of Items when it comes up to solo play. Especially when playing with inexperienced players.
---
Pharmacy allows you to pick up a decent Med-Kit for free at a good speed and without much risk. The good thing about Pharmacy is, that it provides a guaranteed med-kit, a source of self sustain.
---
Self sustain is really important in solo play with inexperienced players, making a Med-Kit + Botany a really good combo. The heals are fast and you can heal atleast 4 to 6 times in total. Plus, Botany also improves your default healing speed, which's also nice to have.
---
If you actually don't need Pharmacy cause you have lots of Med-Kits or just don't face enough Franklin's users, Decisive Strike is your way to go. Potatoes love them easy bloodpoints, making them greed for every unhook they can get. Sadly also to your misfortune most of the time. Decisive Strike helps out with that.
---
When's your birthday, man?
---
&gt;Wringing money
---
&gt;Optional 
---
Pick one
---
i run some pretty crutch perks tbh, but not super common like decisive or balanced landing.. maybe i just need to commit to the game. it’s kinda difficult when rank reset exists and i don’t have much free time sadly.
---
It's not clear. It might be that they'll release the event and then have a Q&amp;A to explain the issues and address some of our concerns, by way of compensation for the delay.
---
🥰
---
hmu when dbd 3 comes out

---
atm i genuinely can’t live without bond.. if i didn’t have it i’d be like rank 20 lol.
---
Same with huntress! If you’re a good shot you never have to lose a stack!
---
I don't remember it ever being this bad. There have been miscommunications in the past, but never a major event delayed like this to my recollection. Been playing since mid-2016 (soon after nurse's release).
---
Survivors act like being hooked is a minute grace period to do whatever they want to.
---
Yes. But thats the toxic series. Isnt it?
---
we're just mad that every other game that has a Halloween event has started theirs already.
---
Excellent timing, I know the rift was supposed to come out sooner but that should be on back burner compared to a Halloween even
---
he needs some MILK
---
Pretty much. Damage control is pretty much why community managers exist, after all.
---
Sure you can use them!
---
She got dat lethal straight right
---
You can feel the love
---
This is adorable and we need more of this wholesomeness
---
Decisive for tunnels, Preferred Exhaustion perk for chases, Iron Will for Spirits (sigh), and Small Game for hexes and NOED hard counter since you know the randoms ain't touching those things.  This build does me right solo queue.  Addresses everything basically.
---
Staying together actually makes gens done slower.
---
There is a 10% reduction penalty in speed for cooperation on generators.
---
With enough experience and game sense, you will know it's best to split up.
---
Noah, get the boat
---
Yea the killer really can't see you , but good clip
---
Following the unhooker is the best move to make, assuming the unhooker is running towards a generator.
---
Hiding, looking for a medkit or someone else just takes too much time.
---
Ruin is great for stalling the game, especially when you are new to a killer or you have low map pressure.
---
Ruin is easily countered by just pure unlucky placement, survivors knowing all the totem spawns and the small game perk
---
Waiting out ds doesnt mean you're not tunneling. I know that sounds like a foreign concept to this sub but it's facts. Slugging out the dude that just got off the hook is getting lame.
---
He never screamed...even when they took his hair...
---
what you just said is actually so true, i just pipped down from a match because my teammates lead the killer to me, refused to let me heal them and just were bad at hook saves. i got farmed and died on the hook. they’re the same rank as me.. i can’t imagine playing like that. i’m not one to talk but i got better than that by rank 19. it just goes to show how influential teammates are in most games, your chances of survival are greatly reduced if you’ve got bad teammates. that’s just something i realized recently, a lot of this game is out of my control. i think realizing that is making me a better player and reading comments like this always helps. idk where i was going with that rant lol
---
Welcome to reddit in a nutshell, just thought it’d be a good meme to create/post since I constantly have to follow survivors rules or I’m “toxic”, might be unoriginal, but it came from a place of passion
---
Nah bro this is my McDonalds I swear.
---
I went through your reddit history - I figured out your Johnnathan, I'm Sharmarko haha
---
What were the chances I would see this? Very trippy
---
Where did you see that? In my games when there’s three of us on one gen it’s popped super quick, and In lower ranks when gen rushing everyone does it together and can pop three in a very short amount of time. I started out the game doing gens separately but it’s been much more effective to work as a team, that’s kind of the point of the game.
---
Nothing says halloween scares like watching a conpany defend themselves from twitch chat.
---
You're amazing!
---
This is the meme 99% of this subreddit has been running with for over a month.
---
I'll never understand how anyone can ask for *insert map here to be reworked when Haddonfield is still a thing lol.  That map needs a rework in the worst way.
---
never actually considered blocking survivors or killers, just exit immediately afterwards
---
While it's really annoying vsing try hard every game as killer, that's how you get better at the game. Just mute chat so the toxic pricks cant tilt you with the ggez and move on. My only complaint is that killer is 1 total rank. I wish it was separate for each killer. I'm a rank 1 myers and doctor. I'm easily a rank 20 nurse and demigorgon. I'm not the type of player that spams 1 killer over and over. I mix it up nearly every game. It's annoying vsing red rank teams with killers I know I'm bad with.
---
Wiki.
---
Also the game tells you. When an action speed is neutral, the progress bar is white. When an action speed is increased, the bar is yellow. When an action speed is decreased, the bar goes red.
---
When you start working on gens together, each new person gets a 10% speed reduction. Trust me I've been playing this game for awhile, I know the mechanics.
---
Some people just take it seriously and some dont. We all use the tools at our disposal at one point or another.
---
Cause Haddonfield is only Survivor sided with Balanced Landing equipped. Many good Survivors prefer Dead Hard tho, simply because it has more outplay potential.
---
Haddonfield consists of LOTS of choke-spots and unsafe pallets. Trapper and Hag are an absolute Nightmare on that map, Billy gets easy chainsaws once he gets you in an unfortunate positioning, Clown can gas the shit out of you almost everywhere without having to worry about too many Line-Of-Sight blockers. Even Wraith is good there since he can approach Survivors and get that hit before they can set up proper loops around the buildings.
---
I dunno, I think the Killers that suffer the most on that map are Huntress and Plague. Huntress can't hit hatchets across the fences most of the time while Plague just can't apply enough pressure when the gens are too splitted.
---
But regardless, Haddonfield definetly ain't Survivor sided. When a Survivor is capable of looping you around a house without any pallets at all, the issue is with you by attempting and loosing mindgames. If you run straight after a Survivor without any attempt to cut them off, you will see more success. The very advantage of the houses is that Survivors can mindgame really well there. When you kill that advantage by not risking any mindgames, there's not that much they can actually do. Even when I must say that it sucks as a 110% Killer. But Hag is still good at that map so...Haddonfield is really just Anti-Huntress I suppose lol.
---
Time to prove you wrong
---
Guys, I have a megastrategy for you: just don't read chat.
---
[that’s cool, but I don’t remember asking](https://youtu.be/SFaqno1cRo8)
---
Oh okay, but overall it is faster? Just each individual person is reduced by 10%? Thank you I just seriously didn’t know.
---
I doesnt need to. There is a hole in the roof of the building. It goes through the roof and hits you.
---
"Bad at fingering"
---
Cmon anyone? Yea? N..no?
---
Credit artists OP...
---
Artist is Stonetoss, normally overly edgy political comics but has some good non political stuff.
---
If it was he failed.
---
You sir are a champion and I will happily follow you to the promise land the entity has made for every killer main!
---
Yoooooo ez infinite
---
Got 4k as clown. Lost a rank because two of them DCed on hook. Typical day.
---
I believe all artists who work hard should be credited. It's so hard to get noticed as an artist of any kind on the internet, so if someone uses your stuff, it's nice to get a shout out.
---
Do the right thing even if you disagree with someone's message
---
For a second i thought you were serious
---
Now do it again :3
---
Well now I get what you mean lmao. *Depressed huntress noise*
---
Every time I see this meme I wonder why more people don't bind their skill check key to their mouse.
---
The Game is two different maps.
---
The top floor has a couple areas that are just stupidly safe (corner staircase pallets, the office, the Pig Vat), but the rest of the pallets are cool, *especially* the ones right next to some of the staircases since the drops play into the loop in an interesting way.
---
The big problem is the bottom floor.
---
There are *maybe* three unsafe pallets in that entire area. Everything else is so safe that you have to be a complete and utter moron to go down.
---
They should really re-do The Game to play more like Hawkins. Those tiles are so damn interesting.
---
See that's the thing! Wanna rage in spirit or nurse ok I guess I get it but clown isnt an easy ass 4k you gotta work for it! I'm sorry bro!
---
I have the Claudette mask and I haven’t used a mori
---
Well if you want some advice from someone with actuall 2000 hours, hear me out :
---
1. The most important thing is, don't get TOO alturistic. Especially SWF's kill themselfes all the time because Survivors just can't stand to leave someone behind. However, the very decision to leave someone behind, can be extremely important. Not just because you might save your own or someone else's ass, but also because the Killer might chase a certain playstyle you want to reward (best example, face camping Leatherface).
---
2. Another thing is that time is EVERYTHING in this game. Never ever attempt to stealth if you're not convinced that it is necessary. The amount of time you waste by attempting to evade a Killer that was actually heading for someone else can be very decisive. It's better to risk being spotted and be time efficient than being too cautious.
---
3. Decision making is important. Similar to the first point, leaving someone to die might be painful, so is tanking a hit for someone who would die on the next down/hook or healing the teammate instead of yourself since you're exposed anyway, but once you realise that these decisions can actually turn out to be good and impactful, you will become much more confident in what you do.
---
4. Red Ranks don't matter shit and should NOT BE SOMETHING TO STRIFE FOR. Honestly. Red Ranks is like sticking your tongue into a beehive. Dedicating to it is always bad idea. The game's are sweaty as hell, everyone plays meta, and the people are even more toxic. Plus, since Red Ranks are rather easy to reach once you dedicate to it, the range of players you meet there is rather huge. You might face someone who has just 100 hours and still walks in order to safe up that Sprint Burst, but you might also face that 2k hours Legacy 3 Nurse that will give you PTSD of the worst kind you could ever imagine. Honestly, if you ain't extremely desperate for honing your skills as a player and focus on the competetive aspects, don't. Just don't.
---
5. Do not hesitate to play off-meta. DbD is one of the games where meta is great, but no must have. Perks like Botany Knowledge, Diversion or even Kindred paired with Open Handed can be extremely impactful when you know how and when to use them. Plus, some people are really spoiled. Selfcare for example hasn't been good since an entire year and there are still lots of people attempting to convince everyone that it's still the hottest shit on the market.
---
So yeah, just some thing I can give you on your way, don't get too frustrated, the whole game relies on humilliating each other. Never forget that. It's only natural for some people to lose their temper when they're being humilliated whilst having no controll at all. Controll is something everyone loves and craves for.
---
They already have a Terminator DLC for their other game (Deathgarden) so maybe they could make some kind of deal
---
I don't think they really confirmed that Freddy is a pedo. Idk about the new one, but Wes Craven tried to make him *just* a child murderer.
---
...They are fooling nobody ok.
---
No mither-  really sucks
---
No mither+  iron will counters StRIdOr fully. No mither on getting unhook is no blood trail and your be wounded anyways so it's actually helpful. Killer can never slug you.
---
When survivors work on a gen together that one gen gets finished faster but if they do two separate gens they get more progress in that time
---
 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Third Seal is actually quite strong against solo survivors. Even SWF that aren't veterans and can't give coordinates properly.
---
Happy cake day
---
Just an fyi, Terminator Resistance is made by separate game developers who got the license from the actually movie studio. I think its called **StudioCanal.** So did Mortal Kombat 11. So i think it's should be DBD's opportunity now. :)
---
I don’t think you can?  
---
Have you gotten a refund for a game before?
---
If you've downloaded the game and played it, sorry bud, you're not eligible for a refund. Policy sucks, but it is what it is.
---
You should totally make stickers of all the killers/ survivors in your art style!
---
That's right. I would hope :)
---
I have watched Avengers, but I get the joke from the memes
---
I like lithe dancing shoes and quick and quiet with. Self heal then maybe a insta heal or tool box. If your playing solo soon as that heart beat is near find a window and get out of there
---
Grinding from 0 will be fun since you are wiser now and you'll make better decisions early on. Also not having everything at your disposal will force you to switch things up and get out if your comfort zone, which will indeed make you a better player, with newfound skills you can use on your main account.
---
I see this as an absolute win.
---
Hey, don't knock it 'till you try it!
---
I was playing killer and a Meg was spam vaulting from across the map to let me know she had found the hatch and insisted on taking it in front of me.  I headed over there, she was teabagging on it (of course), I continued approaching, she continued teabagging, I continued approaching, she continued teabagging...
---
At this point I'm thinking to myself why is she letting me get this close does she want a standoff?  Then she jumped in and I grabbed her right out of there.  Messaged her post game laughing at her and her bm and asked if she knew I could interrupt her.  She didn't give me a solid answer just salt.  It was pretty damn funny.
---
Or for people that keep getting matched against wraith killers who seemed to just always know your exact location and are not fun to play against
---
Best you can hope for is eventually down the road it is fixed, when that happens at least you still own it.
---
Myers is hot of course but not for me:(
---
Having worked in entertainment. Social teams will try their hardest to get information for users to keep things sweet and brand morale up but often times that information sometimes doesn't make it in time and it gets pushed back. The fact they are updating when they can is enough for me.
---
Killers keep acting like SWF is a bad thing but honestly? It doesn't just make Survivor movements and decisions more predictable, but also gives Killers much more bloodpoints. The very first thing that a Killer should learn about SWF, is that they will never ever leave someone behind. Alturism-Self-Overkill. Literally.
---
Wow I totally forgot. Thanks!
---
I'd imagine they will try to drop today for the weekend. They said they'd update by EOP today so it could be... "download that bitches"
---
Or just a date. I got work stuff on halloween and working all day the Saturday next week. Doh
---
Do we even know if we’re getting a winter event?
---
If the guy that got off the hook runs straight up to me, i'm not gonna ignore it, DS or not. If you are the only one in sight after getting unhooked i'm not going to ignore you. That's not "tunneling" that's playing the game. Sometimes you have bad luck. And if you get unhooked when i'm near give me one reason why i should not hit you. Besides your imaginary rulebook.
---
Ok cool but why are you doing the white power sign with your hand?
---
Cock and ball torture. I may not sleep knowing this is a thing.
---
Ive purchased so many addons too, I feel like it should at least work properly. I have it on PC, and it works great. On console its a literal mess.
---
[And then Otzdarva be like](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/spongebob/images/7/75/Broken_Alarm_085.png/revision/latest?cb=20190706131509)
---
I hadn't realised it but when I was playing my housemate came to my room door and I just started shouting "get the fuck away from me."
---
He thought I was talking to him, called me out on it really offended. 
---
Wasn't a lil 20 causing the mischief though.
---
 Just an fyi, Terminator Resistance is made by separate game developers who got the license from the actually movie studio. I think its called **StudioCanal.** So did Mortal Kombat 11. So i think it's should be DBD's opportunity now. :)  u/Mcote_bhvr
---
Recently I took a dude to a hatch and he just yelled at me for being a baby killer and told me to delete game cus I play wrong :/
---
Endless reposts. My god people, stop
---
I'm hoping they felt bad for bullying you post game, but they couldn't have know the game screwed you over like that
---
Can u link your switch and PC accounts together to share progression? If so I've gotta get this for switch.
---
Wow! Awesome!
---
Honestly killer. Killer you just play and get good. Survivor you play and get good but then you also need three other pros and voice comms to have the advantage.
---
* Screenshots highlighting unbalanced matchmaking (use our weekly RAGE WEDNESDAY threads, make sure to censor ALL player names).
---
You *can't* get rid of all the safe pallets.
---
There are just too damn many.
---
Almost every pallet on the bottom floor is safe to the point where the killer *has* to break it.
---
If they don't break it, you can just game the pallet endlessly with no chance of the killer downing you.
---
Forcing a pallet break buys a survivor roughly 18.8 seconds to find another one to use, meaning that they can keep going as long as they can find another pallet within 75 meters.
---
Since it only takes ~3 minutes to complete the gens, you only need to run them to ten pallets before the game's over, and that's just running to pallets and dropping them immediately. That's not taking into account loops, exhaustion perks, or actually *hitting* the survivors.
---
They are a bit messy but the updates get released mostly in time EXCEPT it‘s a big update. The last and only really big update was 2.0 and it was a disaster. Ps4 got the update 1 month later?!
---
That’s just where we’re going to disagree. I do see it as predatory. “Hey, here’s all your favorite movie characters added to the game! $5, please.” “Hey, here’s a bunch of cool cosmetics to use, which you can buy by accumulating this free in-game currency, but if you, you know, have a job that prevents you from playing the game literally every hour of the day, you can just toss us some money to buy them outright.” And of course that system is designed to get you to take the second option by making the grind as long as possible. Then a Battle Pass (preying on your fear of missing out) too, now. Maybe Behaviour isn’t that bad, but accepting such extreme amounts of monetization from devs like them leads to shit like Paradox intentionally releasing incomplete games to get you to pay for the rest of it, and Bethesda thinking they can get away with locking game features that most MMOs give you for free behind a ludicrously expensive membership program. This kind of thing has knock-on effects
---
I kept statistics of my matches for a while and the end of several hundred games I noticed Claudettes showed up as more then 60% of the survivors I played against as a killer, and over 40% of my team mates as survivor when not in a swf.
---
Claudette is nice and all but I'd like to see other survivors represented more.  And I would like a male survivor that has a model similar in size and posture to Nancy or Claudette (that doesnt look like golem/quenten)  just to even things out.  Its a shame 'most' male models hit all three check boxes of being big, bright, and loud.
---
&gt; If I'm actually playing for real though not a single gen gets done so the hatch will never spawn for anyone except the last person anyways.
---
You’re claiming it’s normal for you to put pressure on all seven generators and sacrifice all the survivors before they can complete a SINGLE gen? How do you do it? What rank are you?
---
&gt; Keys are not a problem in any scenario that you create unless you're really just bad at playing killer and tracking.
---
This is the dumbest sentence I’ve ever read. Keys only come into play when the survivors are getting wrecked by the killer.
---
Now we only need cross progress!
---
Woah, didn't know that. Fuck that dude.
---
this is the type of shit id like to frame and hang in my room
---
I usually strive for the Wiki to be useful, but in this case, I'm quite glad it isn't. I prefer playing the old school way (losing line of sight and hiding instead of endless looping). I'd say you should try learning old-school juking skills. It will definitely take longer to get good at since you can't just run circles around obstacles, but it will pay off in the long run, especially against skilled tracking Killers.
---
People shouldn't always try to go for the easiest way.
---
Fuck stonetoss
---
I'm constantly eyeing the ping to give myself  the best chance at games I don't lag in. 
---
It doesn't happen very often, but it still does: The ping would be fine up until 15 seconds before the game starts, when it suddenly starts jumping from green to yellow and red continuously. I'll leave if I see that happening, I'm not about to deal rubber-banding for the next 10 minutes
---
David, easily. Dead Hard is arguably the best exhaustion perk and one of the best perks in the game. WGLF is also nice to have and helps with the grind.
---
Laurie is worth leveling but after David. DS is slightly overrated IMO, and will randomly save your ass, while Dead Hard is always useful. You only need one person on the team to have it (this will generate an obsession, and force the killer to play as if *everyone* has DS). Sometimes I'll just run a key with a wedding ring to emulate the same effect. As long as there is an obsession, the killer will slug the unhook 90% of the time.
---
SWF shouldn't be ranked.
---
I fucking hate that boat. I always get hit through fast vaults on it.
---
Genius
---
They must be related then...interesting.
---
When u said hex ruin is considered toxic that’s when I stopped taking u serious
---
thank you for the advice! i’ll take this into consideration. as someone who runs bond, lithe, and spine chill i’m glad you mentioned the underrated/non meta perks. also reading these replies.. maybe i’ll just keep purple ranks as a goal instead. easier to achieve, less toxicity, more fun?
---
Thats tinkerer my guy
---
Every single hag and huntress player with thrill of the hunt too.
---
Happened in one of my games. I went for the door and I was able to hear the nurse's grunt sounds. Left immediately, nobody does in that game xD
---
Was this me? Seems like something I'd do. Maybe it's just pig players
---
It's what she deserves.
---
Honestly, I can't tell anymore but back when swf would load in together the matches seemed to mostly go the same way. The one complaint I can understand is 4 instaheals (not after this upcoming nerf tho lol), 4 old ds, or sabo squad(doesn't really work) and even then I have only went against the 4 old ds once.
---
U saw Nothing
---
While yes most of these are pretty good, I feel you are being a bit negative towards other survivors.
---
Additionally instead of self care you can bring a medkit
---
Finally, dead hard is currently a bit broken on dedicated servers. So yeah, it's good but that is also why it has been the meta perk for months if not longer.

I think this one is much better than shirtless Myers. Lmao

Either this or when I go for a sip of water.

The facebook communities are the most toxic places I've ever seen

My sister is a manager at McDonald's and has worked there for years. The ice cream machine isn't broken. It's a cleaning process. They can't serve ice cream during the cleaning process. The ice cream becomes scolding hot.

Noob3 doesn't really help his case by naming his videos "making killers DC" or "Toxic Nea". Without watching his videos its kinda natural to assume he's toxic.

For real, survivors complain when killers do shitty things, but act like yall dont complain when you play against a 4 swf with insta meds? or hell just a 4 swf.
---
I'd like to keep these two myself, but if you're serious I can draw another just for you!
---
It takes 2.6 seconds to break a pallet. 
---
That's 2.6 seconds of the survivor running at 4 m/s away from the killer. 
---
That opens a gap of 10.4 meters. 
---
After that you need to account for lunge,  which is a 50% haste for 0.3 seconds. 
---
For a 115 killer that works out to 2.9 meters closed each second, or 0.87 meters closed after the 0.3 second lunge. 
---
That means there are another 9.53 meters that need to be closed by holding m1. For a 115 killer you're closing by 0.6 meters each second.
---
That works out to 15.9 seconds of holding w.
---
Add in the 2.6 seconds of breaking and 0.3 second lunge and that's 18.8 seconds bought per pallet.
---
You can get spirit for free... just by playing. Like i said you dont need to buy the pass. I havent bought one thing from the game other than the game itself. Most other stuff can be acquired through shrine or iridescent shards to buy killers.
---
Currently I'm focusing on getting more consistent with my style, maybe someday!
---
Reaching rank 1 as survivor doesn’t require any brain power, and reaching rank 1 as killer requires some brain power but not much because the game’s ranking system is a joke. Rank is mainly just an indicator of how much you play the game, rather than how good you are. People in high ranks are generally better because they’ve played more, and experience generally makes people better, but there are many people who never actually improve and rank up anyways. If you wanted to reach rank 1, you could do it.
---
So there’s no Halloween event for this game? Wow
---
I'm working on it right now! Damn I already drew the entire mask, devilface would look cool indeed!
---
thanks &lt;3
---
thank you !!
---
I hate keys. You can do your whole game right and suddenly lose.
---
i meme but get joke avengers
---
It's always great when the game works perfectly. One in chase, 3 on gens. No time wasting.
---
I'll think about it! Thanks :) !!
---
thank you so much!
---
I'm thinking about doing more DBD-characters, so maybe in the future I will do clown ! Thanks for the follow :)
---
DS is actually bugged on grabs by the Nurse. You can hit the skill check but you don’t get dropped, so she likely hit it and then you put her down.
---
I'm really hard at hearing.  My headset helps a lot But only really for terror radius I never notice the sound from spine chill or premonition.
---
 I wish it was a visual or something better
---
Exactly... i bought game for £15 and each full dlc is £2 on ps4 like all the time. Dont like to pay money, then save up shards and get the characters you can.
---
thanks dude!

So excited when i get to use my deliverance
---
I have posted it yesterday so you can check that one out too :)
---
I am amazed myself this post blew up so much! thanks :)
---
Whats the point in self care if you have bond...
---
Bond &gt; Alert imo, knowing what your teammates are doing is vital compared to what the killer is doing. I couldn't care if the killer is across the map in chase. I'd rather care about if my other teammate is on the last gen or breaking a totem.
---
Bond, BT, DH, Adrenaline
---
TBH it's hard to decide which one is the better, one thing is sure... I will be not sad when he will pick me up and I can rotate my camera in that certain direction.... \*cough

I can yes, you can message me if you're serious!

thank you ! really means alot :)

God I love that old vine.

I am not acusing them of anything iam just pissed off lol
---
\*shock play\*
---
Okay, what is killer supposed to do to win? Kill survivors, fastest way to do this is to chase already injured survivor (tunnel)
---
That's... Well, with the same logic this perk is good on Billy and Bubba.
---
Why do you think the mid-chapter is weeks away? The mid-chapter PTB started on the 8th of October, meaning it should've been out by the 22nd.
---
At first they wanted to make him a pedo but due to the mass histeria during that time they changed him into a child murderer instead.
---
She just threw it at you like it was a rope dart.
---
let her open the door then mori her (happend to me once) x(
---
That's why I have the action bind on MOUSE5 button.  Save me a headache.
---
Don't listen to them ! keep it up fellow artist &lt;3
---
I will def post others soon, working on a Ghostface drawing right now :) thanks !
---
On top of that, with the direction the devs are going with reworking maps and making many unsafe pallets, survivors need get a stun on the unsafe pallets to make distance. Spirit fury and enduring sucks to go against on Springwood and Hawkins lab.
---
thank you !
---
jebaited
---
Is this sarcastic?
---
lol !
---
It's because of your big butt.
---
i like this game and i find it fun to play. i like the characters, the community etc.
---
however.. there are certain things i don’t like about it, and sometimes when you get a basement camping leatherface w/ stealthy claudettes crouching to save you, it kind of makes you want to say “i hate this game.”
---
Is the downside to that, that you either hit great or miss it, like no in between?
---
I know camping is stupid for both of them, I don't support camping, but I don't have anything again tunneling
---
Yeah, I get that. Although I'd say it's not so much the game that you hate at that point but norso that specific match in my opinion.
---
Im telling you, adding 20 seconds to gens is barely going to affect gen rushing. A coordinated team can still out-rush a good killer. This change will only make survivor gameplay more boring and killers will remain frustrated.
---
We need to instead shorten gen repair times and add new interactive objectives for survivors to complete in order to trigger the exits.
---
STBFL is absolutely my favorite killer perk, its so much stronger than people think it is if you keep it stacked.
---
I don't mind either way tbf. I'll keep playing as per usual cause I enjoy the game. 👍
---
Excellent.
---
I love your comic strips. I must have more, I need the cuteness!
---
Well I think that's a simple matter of human psyche. Dead By Daylight more or less relies in humilliating your opposition. In addition to the fact that the game is asymmetrical anyway, SWF's just like to gang up on a Killer and talk them down. The Killer can take it one way or the other, but the bare fact that it's a literall 4v1 with said humilliation aspects...It's just kind of unpreventable. 
---
Plus, players are nicer to randoms that actually play good. Ofcourse premades won't blame each other and attempt to blame everything on the Killer that went wrong from their perspective. People just appreciate it when randoms ain't incapable potatoes. While, as already mentioned, premades tend to gank up on the Killer instead of fighting each other.
---
It's just the entire package of the game and how we as humans work I suppose.
---
Feels bad man. My choice was between the Game map and the streamers. I choose wrong XD
---
Honestly I wish I could draw this good! Carnt wait to see you're other drawings👍
---
I got there 5 seconds before this person, 5 seconds too long apparently
---
the best way to tunnel is to camp because toty can't risk the survivor getting healed or escaping.
---
(also insert why you booing me I'm right meme to all the people downvoting me)
---
I completely disagree with that
---
Translation: I am entitled to win every game should I choose to want to, killers need to be respectful and leave me alone. Should I feel especially charitable I might not teabag at exit gates, in that case you are welcome.
---
I never run OoO, I personally hate the perk
---
There is a visual. For Spine Chill the perk lights up as it's active, but dark when killer ain't looking your way. Premonition gets a cooldown marker on it when it's activated.
---
This. Is. AMAZING!
---
I love it!!!!!
---
Also can we make noed a non hex and activates for 60 seconds after each gen
---
No vommy no party
---
I think the reason everyone is mad at you is because of how rude you are being about this just take a chill pill and calm down.

Doing that would make the games a shit show like last years. Nobody didnt anything last year but milk the plants. They tied it into the rift so its a progression system and not something people will screw over other survivors for.
---

---
You need to realise that the people who create the cosmetics are not the same as the people who work on fixing the game. These outfits have been in the game for a while now, and all them have a schedule for when they should be released.
---
Issues with the Hallow Blight event have nothing to do with them releasing new costumes, and visa vera.
---
Really entitled view of your issue here pal. Also what is that weird fucked appeal to emotion, trying to make us pity you? How many people you think In your situation not making pathetic sympathy posts on reddit.
---
What I used is called a hyperbole statement, in which case I would obviously exaggerate, thought that was, you know, obvious? And that still doesnt change the point of my statement "These survivors are garbage" Which in this case in completly true, even at rank1 you find survivors that do this, vs rank1 killers, and yes, these survivors are also garbage and belongs at rank 20( [Hyperbole](http://www.literarydevices.com/hyperbole/) incase you missed it)
---
I would take a Wraith all day before almost any other killer. With him the game tends to be entertaining (imo), unless it's a camper/tunneler (but any killer sucks if he camps or tunnels anyway).
---
While I understand that, personally I feel the cosmetics should have been released along side the event not separately, even though they finished the cosmetics earlier what was stopping them holding on to the cosmetics before releasing the event? Nothing but potential profit which in my opinion feels scummy when they put making the most possible profit above the event most of the community was really looking forward to.
---
Whats is the definition of Inmersive player?
---
Mandatory stonetoss is a Nazi
---
A player playing like if he dies in the game, he dies irl too.
---
One game my ruin was so well hidden that survivors couldnt find it. They did however find 1 of the haunted grounds. Instead of powering through ruin like sane survivors, they proceeded to throw themselves at the haunted grounds, even though i got 3 hooks based purely off yoinking them off or downing them when they tried. The fact that i was essentially camping this hence made them adamant it was ruin.
---
2 more hooks later and i give them just enough time to get to it and break it. They had 2 people bodyblocking so the last guy could get it. So i just stood there and watched as he broke it.
---
**HEX HAUNTED GROUNDS**
---
*DC DC DC DC*
---
It was a good time. As you can imagine, the survivors didnt think it was funny.
---
Train, train your skills and go strong
---
Killer gets the quitter bonus (650BP) which is more than the hook BP.
---
Not sure about the badge, but that doesn't sound right either, will have to check that.
---
Except here nobody's making money off of this comic edit. So the Joker comparison is irrelevant. And giving him credit makes him more popular and his ideas more mainstream. Let's not make nazis normal, please.
---
My point isn't a complaint about the event being late it's a complaint that they released the skins without the event, I am complaining because they chose to put the profitable items out while not releasing the event they were supposed to be tied to
---
&gt;What I used is called a hyperbole statement,
---
You are trying to defend yourself talking smack as if you were right in the first place when you clearly aren't.  They are very clearly Rank 1 so they deserve to be there as much as you do.  There is no "Hyperbole" defense here.
---
Ultra-Rare perks. I nut
---
Thats Myers mori my guy
---
This game can be both entertaining and stressful. I don't play to win with this game because I usually just take all the risks in-game, surprisingly managed to make it out alive or getting a 4K without the sweaty killer playstyle.
---
Gorgeous, finally some good fucking content
---
This is beatiful 10/10
---
Killer with franklins and ruin: am I a joke to you?
---
Some survivors (You’ll notice I say SOME) I sag: “If you’re getting gen rushed you’re not applying enough pressure. Stop whining.”
---
Those same survivors being downed shortly after being unhooked: “OMG, stop tunneling me and play fair, you POS!!!”
---
The only problems I have with the game itself is balancing issues with most of the perks. About 80% of both Survivor and Killer perks aren't viable in higher ranks, causing most games to be about finding Ruin, avoiding DS etc.
---
The actual issue I have is how toxic the playerbase can be sometimes.
---
Territorial imperative Bubba is underrated
---
The event was only supposed to be a week long not 70 days wtf are you talking about. The skins were released as Halloween skins, skins we were meant to be able to earn by grinding but instead they say fuck the fan we need a quick buck and release the skins anyway. The reason I am annoyed is because by releasing them early they've completely said fuck it and given up on the fans who are dedicated enough to earn the skins and instead milk their fans for the profit
---
I mean you could just get rid of them
---
That sounds a bit too good. Like a bootleg sprint burst, iron will combo.
---
This is awesome. I hope you do this as a living because you have the skills to pay the bills, as some people say.
---
If the Killer hits the survivor who you unhooked then it will not give you progress on the achv. You need to unhook someone and be sure that you get hit near them in order to gain progress.
---
A good way to avoid the unhooked person from being hit is to run [Borrowed Time](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Borrowed_Time), Bill has this perk on him by default and the achivement is built based around that particular perk. If the Killer is smart they will smack you since the risk of BT is usually a high enough threat to making going for the rescuer easier (with the exception of stealth killers who can bypass BT, such as Myers or Ghostface in certain situations.)
---
TL:DR- technically, yes you have to unhook while the killer is nearby. The killer must hit you, not the person who was saved to get progress on the achiv. Run the perk Borrowed Time to help with this achievement.
---
Yeah, but it was just a thought. Because I've seen videos of people doing messed up shit like cutting off their own limbs without screaming or showing any pain
---
No no surely you didn't admit to fking with the competitive integrity of a game, then complain on reddit when others didn't. Grow up mate
---
I never see that. 3 man SWF farming = dying in 60 seconds with a killer no mercy. Hell I got left on the ground all match before with the killer constantly running past me only to hook me at the last second.
---
I just DC if my teammates are being cunts. No point in bothering.
---
Yooo that's fuckin cool
---
You´re using the meme format wrong. The guy you gave the trapper mask is the unreasonable one in the meme while the other one is trying to reasonably explain common sense. You switched that around.
---
Unless you´re supporting survivors who can´t deal with being killed while it´s actually the only job the killer has.
---
Oh my bad, I was trying to look at memes using this format to try to figure that out, but I guess I still didn't get it in the end
---
&gt;The event was only supposed to be a week long not 70 days wtf are you talking about.

---
You are complaining about the skins being released earlier and mentioned the Halloween event in the same sentence. They aren't tied to each other. The Hallowed Blight event is just generators, hooks and spooky items.
---
The skins were released within time frame of the actual Halloween so BHVR go that right if you think about it. We will be able to grind for them once the rift is introduced. The rift will lasts 70 days before it closes.

[Dead by Daylight | The Archives Reveal

---
Biggest horror game currently out &amp; has no Halloween event. These devs really need to start spending all their millions on some actual game developers.
---
You should let go of the gen when “smoke” is coming out of it, it won’t process but can still generate a skill check when you are working on it at that time.
---
I was wondering that myself, the killers are supposed to accept a deal where they get to torment others for eternity, but the plague was a priest who died hiding the disease she brought upon herslef to save others, it doesn't really fit
---
When the game isn’t going well so I ‘pretend I was friendly wraith all along’ and sit in cloak running around and we all have a good laugh but they can’t see me crying.

Dead hard, balanced landing, borrowed time, decisive, adrenaline, unbreakable, sprint burst, prove thyself, OoO, head on, spine chill, looping in general, keys, flashlights, instaheals, brand new part, toolbox above brown quality, swf, a well coordinated solo team that isn’t swf, haddonfield, cleaning a lit totem, cleansing dull totems so noed doesn’t proc, 99ing gates, running loops until entity blocker, flashlight saves, stun saves, bodyblocking, sabotaging hooks, old decisive, old mettle of man.

Are all things off the top of my head that I’ve seen killers complain about on here. Not saying all of these are fair (namely instaheals, old decisive and MoM) but once you realise that a lot of this sub is a hardcore main of one side with an incredible bias, you’ll start to laugh at these “survivor bad killer gud” and “survivor gud killer bad” posts. You’re all as bad as each other, you all deserve each other.

---
*Skeleton_Doot.mp4*
---
I see your point but the stuff you earn from the Halloween event is specifically to buy the skins released at the same time as the Halloween event the thing I'm annoyed about is why behaviour can't just release the skins and event along side because currently the only way you can get the skins you're supposed to be able to earn is by paying for them and it's not even like they're reasonably priced. It's just really agitating they have released the profit items rather than having them joined to the event they were meant to release on side with
---
They could also have a daily to get chased.
---
i have no involvement with the guy or any 'naziness' he might have. How nazi someone is is also irrelevant to the topic. Its just the concept of an artist being credited for their work.
---
Its a fundemental thing. Rather than picking and choosing who is allowed to receive credit for their work.
---
Pig main, but that is the cringiest sub-reddit I have seen.
---
and they point at you,tbag you and you was a trying to do a daily with a rank 1 trapper
---
That's badass. Do you perhaps have some other art?
---
Don't use a Mori  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
While I do get the reasoning behind not having it, it's a real shame for players that never got to experience it. I'd also love a second objective in the game since it slows it down by being there. I was really looking forward to squishing some of those flowers :/. Themed gens and hooks are not really an "event" or something that changes up the game.
---
Are You seriously going to sit there and say the skin called "servant of the SERUM" is not related to the event which allows you to collect the serum because if so that's pretty impressive

&gt;And that's what someone who's lost an argument looks like

What argument? I linked you the video of the own devs saying how the event works and you continue to talk about the event and serum as if they were related to each other.
---
1000 times yes
---
What you don’t understand is how devoted exactly adiris is to the gods basically she worships the entity for answering her prayer and will do anything it says including ditching her morals and sacrificing everyone
---
It is good on bubba, I use it.

Plague literally thinks the entity is her God, so she's easy for it to manipulate

yeah.. thats what I said.

or just make it when a survivors cleansing a totem gain a 1.5% movement speed per totems left in match so 7.5% if someone cleanses a totem with 5 on map
---
The two sentences seems separate from one another. Like I read this as “We are having a Q&amp;A next week.” Obviously this is gonna be the much needed transparency about the delays and the visual/verbal apology that a tweet/Forum post can’t magnify. 
---
Second, “Team is hard at work getting the mid patch ready ASAP” This only further enhances the “damage control” aspect of the need for the livestream. I feel like the second sentence has to be included because they want to make players sure that they are not ignoring the patch fiasco they’re having. Like could you imagine the devs in the position right now trying to generate any hype for future content in the middle of this?

He does. Look at his twitter. Stop trying to defend a guy that would, in all honesty, have no problem curb-stomping you if you're not a white guy that passes his hateful standards.
---
Mori offerings do not turn around on the offering screen. 
---
Yellow mori's = nonexistent 
---
Green mori's = barely ever used (plus he would have mori'd the Jake immediately or shortly after he got downed.) 
---
Ebony mori's = most likely + the fact that he was playing bubba most likely meant he was planning on camping, tunneling the survivor off the hook and killing them.
---
It would be funny if the reason you're getting kicked out of "EVERY" match is because your NAT type is Strict/Moderate. Then you can go call your ISP or Microsoft and demand a refund for that. I get matches no problem and never get booted out.

I don’t know why but I kinda really like third seal. As survivor and killer. I even get excited when I see it as a survivor cause it’s not the standard meta perk

 You're allowed to do whatever you want, mah boy.. Play whether solo, or SWF with ur friends, use any tools at your disposal,  no matter how unbalanced they are.

The superior subreddit
---
Baby killers never hey treated nicely xD
---
Am I the only one that thinks the spirit looks like she had cancer
---
Not necessarily. Unless each of the two survivors started on separate gens, it's better to just stick to one gen and work on it together. Yes, it's overall slower, but the second survivor would still need to run around and find a different gen, and depending on the map, that could take way longer. In the end, they would have saved more time if they had just stayed together on one generator. 
---
And there are also other factors to take into. If the killer has Ruin, then doing a gen together is a bit a risky since more chances for skill checks, and there's no guarantee everyone knows how to do Greats. If they have Discordance, then it's obviously bad. 
---
Basically, it's not always "together bad, alone good". A good player would need to assess the situation and react accordingly.

I changed my Steam name to "Play Pig" for a few months recently just to encourage getting more games against her. There were several really nice killers who told me post game that they switched to her just because I asked. But, in the pre-game lobby, the amount of disgust I'd get from fellow survivors about it broke my heart. Like, she's not a top tier killer. Would you rather play against another spirit/nurse/billy? I just want to get roared at and hear some squeaks.
---
Comparing the reactions for a delayed event here and then reading the reactions for the delay on the release of TLOU 2 on twitter...
---
Dude, please make a Trapper one, I'd die of happiness.
---
Yes! I finally found rui- OH NO THAT WAS HAUNTED GROUNDS
---
Yep basically
---
*cough cough* spiderman glasses
---
I know right, the recent players tab doesn't even work. They have to manually enter psn into search.
---
Oh bugger off. If they cared enough, they would never put themselves in a situation where they had to massively delay major events and big game updates that had been planned for up to a year or more in advance. This pile of shit gets worse with every update. If they cared enough, the game might actually improve once in a while. But it doesn't. It's a constant broken mess. 
---
I tell you what they do care about though. Booting out cosmetic after cosmetic at £8 a pop for all the toxic mugs in this community, who they know prefer their overpriced silly outfits, prefer the imbalance, and prefer the advantages they get from the bad game design, prefer all of that to any real changes/fixes that would actually improve and fairly balance the game.

Fuck the devs! Fuck the shit community! And fuck all the chickens too!

Please send me a link of your video too, I'd love to see it!
---
What’s the original? Got a link so I can see it?
---
Yeah I'm glad people like you are also sticking around. this is exactly my sentiment.
---
As long as I had fun, it was worth the time invested. Otherwise I'd just stop playing.
---
I'll wait for this!

To be frank this exact image referring to getting the Spirit accidentally has been posted over 15 times with may be the smallest variation of top text over the past 2 months
---
It wastes my time carrying them to the hook and I know that's seconds but those matter also I dont get the credit for pgtw
---
I always say for me it is a love/hate relationship.
---
I love the game but hate some aspects but not in a way that I would quit playing forver.
---
I love the lore aspect and excited its growing.
---
Things I love, the random situations that arise.
---
Each match being different all the variables.
---
Love the excitment and emotions a good chase can have and getting a kill on a skilled survivor, or escaping a good killer pulling off a 360 or a good juke. The flip I hate sometimes the game makes me feel emotions I don't get a little angry or titled but that means take a break.
---
I love how many killers I can choose from and all the perks and addons and make fun or silly or serious builds so much variety. The flip side I hate its such a grind it seems like we are punished for trying to play too many different killers because as we spend on one our others start to rub out of addons and offerings. Also because its a competitive game a lot of people run meta only so seeing variety lacks sometimes.
---
I try and be the change I want and even at high ranks will run less viable killers and builds just because I'm having fun.
---
I hate getting tunneled or camped as well.
---
The big thing I hate though is this is one of the more toxic gaming communities I have participated in but I try not to let it get to me or if it starts to I take a break. This is the first game I've had to turn off my messages for and it sucks but people are like that.
---
I could write a book with all the things I love and hate about this game but the things I love keep me coming back.
---
Just got rank here HG on my Freddy 😂 feels so good with ruin
---
You know, there are male nurses. 
---
Btw, awesome job drawing the iconic myers mask. The detail you put for the sagging cheekbones could be easily overlooked but you drew them so well done!
---
"It ruins the gaming experience." Said the guy camping the first hook when barely 1 gen has been done
---
Yowee Wowee I didn’t think I was going to see a 9 min time on this video. I thought it was just a clip.
---
Boop the snoot, get the hook!
---
This is really adorable though, I love all the art you make!
---
Omg this is amazing you did such a good job on it well done!

You forgot about people having bad matches that aren’t fun and make it obvious that certain aspects of the game should be changed. You do know you are allowed to like something and criticize it at the same time right?

I went against him once as hag, and his wifi was 400 ping. Ik for a fact it wasn't mine ir the other players, becuz we all complained. He was playing hag and was being toxic all game, and trying to abuse his lag in as many ways possible. He didn't even say "gg". I played with him as survivor before, but he just played immersed. Eventually I got tired of his crouching bs and equiped bond and led the killer to him. He's just toxic and bad, but he likes to act like he's good. He's one of the reasons this game doesn't have very many good players they take advice from him, instead of someone like Niva1a, a person who does in depth information videos and guides.

Pfft that punch made me lol

A Cadillac.
---
Loyalist Scum!
---
Bit hard to explain but mostly because I am slowly drifting towards a map.
---
Basically sandbagging is when you block a fellow survivor and cause their down.
---
Example: Throwing a pallet and blocking a fellow survivor behind said pallet with the killer on its tail.
---
Laurie about hit Mike with that Dempsey Roll.
---
See how them shoulders tucked?
---
That man dead and he don't even know it
---
yeah to drop that many pips sounds like a personal problem
---
This.
---
And anyone who says "it doesn't bother me," without being asked, is usually a sign that it does.
---
That's actually really nice of you, but even so if i was stupid enough to directly run into the killer, after being hooked, i wouldnt expect any mercy :)
---
Over 1000 hours on PC and play in red ranks.
---
But yes, you right. Am the babiest of babies. Carry me, friend. I donut know what I’m doing.
---
Please tone it down my Dad is trying to sleep.
---
Oh my God yes
---
Only 1k hours over 3 years. Baby survivor
---
Dweet &lt;3
---
I read unneutralized as unneutered
---
I bought the game like three months ago, dude. Lmao.
---
You’re reaching here.
---
yes you are
---
Been playing since Spirit (~a year) and there’s been one or two times where they delayed it but it still ends up as buggy as the rest, don’t get your hopes up
---
I would personally advise using protection against "the plague".
---
Right, I am saying that with another obsession perk this would start revealing auras immediately, and it wasn't clear if that was intended. Just a nitpick, but the MtG judge in me came out.
---
I have no idea what did you base this tierlist on.
---
Playstyle or power? 
---
If power, I have no idea what is Bubba doing so high, about Spirit, just try do something against her, I had really good survivors beating me as Spirit and I don;t think I'm bad Spirit, they just played better.  
---
If playstyle, it depends on a player, not a killer, but in general I don't find Spirits toxic, in my eperience Clowns and Doctors are the most toxic players, which is understanable cause both killers are crap and frustrating.
---
So you play 12 hours a day for 3 months straight. Course baby
---
Ye I'll hard pass on more boring gameplay of a camping hag.
---
"Hooks and rubber"
---
This looks like the actual artwork they show in the shop goddamn
---
I like how you blured her weapon
---
Literally hundreds of reasons for someone not to ready up. Could be taking a piss.
---
She has counterplay kinda. But it depends on skill of a spirit. If she is playing perfectly and optimally, you cant really counterplay her a much. You can delay the down, tho, because of the cooldown and slow movement speed.
---
Cute face.... well atleast 1/2 of it
---
I’m still waiting for the console optimization patch that was promised by December

of 2018.

You: **texting**

You: I want this to be scary
---
Billy I agree with but spirt is more fair than nurse hahahahahahahahaha I call bull
---
That is an offensive hand sign
---
We can do it scoops Steve!!
---
Different killers. All maxed at 50
---
&gt; I tell you what they do care about though. Booting out cosmetic after cosmetic at £8 a pop for all the toxic mugs in this community, who they know prefer their overpriced silly outfits, prefer the imbalance, and prefer the advantages they get from the bad game design, **prefer all of that to any real changes/fixes that would actually improve and fairly balance the fucking game.**
---
How can people be this stupid? Are you for real? Unless you are purposely saying this to troll and mimic stupid people. 
---
They are literally changing the Nurse, the most controversial and complained character in the game since she came out. So much for "not caring about balance". They are changing instaheals, one of the few broken mechanics left in the game.
---
The worst part (and I know this is mainly if not fully because of my skill) is when I try to deliberately hook everyone twice before killing I only get 1/2 kills because it takes four gens to do so
---
I’ll be eat the mori before I even spawn
---
Not aimed at me? Sorry for being confused that it was a direct response to my comment then? Also I'm really not having a go at anyone lol.
---
Stealth players need to quit the game or i'm gonna pick bond and start pointing them every single time
---
Better on trapper if you can corral them into your traps. Picking up obsession doesn't yoink token.
---
Another reason why i would like to have gestures like in dark souls, so i could wave and say hello to the killer in that situation, before i'm getting downed :D
---
That's just good manners :)
---
&gt; or how to moonwalk as dashing pig.
---
Would that be walking backwards? I'm still learning killers and I haven't bought the Pig yet but I plan on getting her soon.
---
nah you've been given proof which you've said isn't good enough by your standards, your mind was already made up and nothing anyone here could say was going to change it lets be honest.  
---
also you're on the internet, if people aren't providing the proof you so desire google is free my dude.
---
That's awesome as hell.
---
bill
---
Maybe if you were actually chill it would.
---
Yeah, art isn't for you. Don't feel bad.
---
&gt;No reason to make someone suffer because people have to wait. These types of games are not fun for the killer.
---
Don't say that to me. Tell that to the people that spam the devs complaining about not being able to play. 
---
If devs make matchmaking wider reducing queue times but causing "unfair" match ups, people complain.
---
If devs make matchmaking stricter causing long queue times, people complain.
---
This is a joke right? 
---
You are clearly the one ruining the game. Why the camping and all the slugging? They had just 1 gen done.
---
Even if it’s not what the developers intended for, and I don’t see how they couldn’t have intended for it, it’s only good use is camping. Either a hooked person or tricking survivors into thinking you’ve left a gen.
---
You still had some good addons to play with.
---
The idea to give us more to work towards is great. The fact that it’s battle pass for a paid that has a bunch of DLC is what’s disgusting.
---
Been getting trolled like this at level 19, only want the platinum damn it I’m a survivor main
---
I think it's the second one with added immaturity and it applies to a lot of people on this sub unfortunately.
---
Why are you using self care if you have bond?
---
Add a colorblind mode so I can play killer or hit ruin skillchecks
---
&gt;Been getting trolled like this at level 19, only want the platinum damn it I’m a survivor main
---
According to the devs notes, rank 20 to 15 aren't affected by the matchmaking in order to ensure that you can find a game.
---
Nice play, hope you safe my ass one day!
---
Its a "competitve" game and attracts more of the competitive types so you will get a lot more of those who need some sort of stat feedback to get that little chemical reward in their brain.
---
The games only real stats are hours played and rank so they focus on that.
---
If we had number of kills or times escaped it would be that.
---
Then add the fact a lot of competitive types will always not just brag but then have to insult others stats to inflate their self importance/accomplishment.
---
Not all of us come to a competitive game to play competitively.
---
You do you and have fun.
---
Yes I'm for real you cunt. Read it all again.
---
Except I am chill. 
---
Literally no reason for me not to be? It’s a video game, not the end of the damn world.
---
I thought I’m the only one.. ridiculous
---
Babysitter is definitely a lackluster perk. Most of Steve's are tbh but the babysitter is definitely the least useful.
---
Survivors need a big buff in BP. There's too many killers and not enough survivors for all the killers so you get long waits and unfair matches.
---
Probably they found some bugs and had balls to postpone the release. Do people really want to get an unfishined product?
---
You are sir, but reddit is sometimes well... Reddit
---
I loathe the name vommy mommy so much but take my upvote
---
This is one of the saddest things I’ve seen. You proxy camp, then hard camp and slug and BM the survivor while they’re on hook. And you bitch about them disconnecting.
---
Pulls out Prayer Beads Spirit and two ebony moris.
---
If you say so pal
---
Matchmaking itself hasn’t been an issue, I’ve been going against level 9~12 which is just making me wanna pull my hair out to be honest 😂 just a baby killer whining don’t mind me
---
I know but games take so goddamn looong.
---
only until you see it the pig you either see a box first or you dont spawn near one or the pig ambushes you
---
Basically a meme perk. Using it will usually put the killer at a disadvantage.
---
Well all im gonna say is, if you camp I'm gonna bitch. That shit is annoying and Ghostface has a huge advantage against survivors because of the bad servers, and i don't blame them from wanting to get you out of stealth. And yes I'm a survivor main.
---
I do, yes. Lol.
---
I like this, the limit shouldn't be tied to the survivor but to myers. I get it's so he can only t3 so many times for balance. I don't know how many times if played optimal he can t3 now so I'm just gonna say 5 times for arguments sake.
---
So what I want to see happen is make it so he can get those 5 uses of his power from any 1 survivor or from a mix of all 4 but then he can't t3 any more after the 5th use. This way if someone d/c or suicides etc you are not punished.
---
Delay by Daylight
---
Also why do people get Feng's Howling Grounds cosmetic but not huntress' or David's?
---
I mean, yeah you have asshats like that, but you do genuinely get pet who just want to play with friends.
---
I mean, my friends and I are more likely to sandbag each other on purpose and say "get fucked dude" than run OoO.
---
That's how I've been playing most of the time and there are better and worse days. Yesterday I died because this random Claudette bodyblocked the 99% gate's switch until the Plague was in vomit range - obviously she had Corrupt Purge, because someone was cleansing the entire match. The Claudette and the cleansing one escaped. I left the match with a promise to myself not to play the solo queue again... I broke it 30 seconds later.
---
Finally Halloween strikes back against Christmas’s constant pushing. “Fuck your Christmas we do me even Afterwards!”
---
I Literally saw people asking the devs to sell the company, this is a message to those people rather than people that are simply memeing
---
Assumes you can get an unhook if they aren’t feeding themselves to the killer. 
---
Also, pipping gets higher requirements in higher ranks.
---
Why
---
I feel similar to a few people here; if any kind of game-wise voice chat system is implemented, the killers will need to be buffed. 
---
But another idea might be to add a penalty to full SWF groups by reducing the number of pallets in a map, or even allow 3 person SWF groups to play matches with a killer. I simply don’t feel that adding communication between solo survivors is the way to go, seeing as that’s the main reason SWF is toxically OP atm
---
And an absolute loss for those of us who dbd is the only multiplayer game we play
---
Wait I thought the event was "Unforeseen Circumstances". The best event ever.
---
Someone who does literally nothing but crouch around the map. They don't finish gens, they don't unhook, and their chases with the killer last for 5 seconds. The people tend to get carried by SWF groups.
---
Not complaining about being tunnelled. That shit happens. Especially since the exit gates were open, I was just unhooked and the only person injured.
---
Was kind of expecting it. Don’t really care about that. Shit happens.
---
And not that I’m aware of. I was rank 3 when I left for Ireland, not sure what rank I’d be at now though, since rank reset.
---
Scoops brother
---
water
---
I do this if the survivors are doing shit, just to keep the game going. The best games are the ones where the gens are done, 3-4 survivors remain and anything could happen
---
If you're being useless, making you escape is the last thing I want
---
Oh no you didn't
---
I get that, he'd be adorable as hell but kinda hard to spot.
---
Well you can look up the original artist on twitter but I'll keep posting some of these in the meanwhile.
---
Oh my gosh, it is called a bug, it happens in games. I believe everyone experienced this, including me. Just reenter survivor lobby or change your outfit again.
---
Laurie will always be the real babysitter
---
Does anyone else have any good strategies for the Demogirgon? Any good perk builds?
---
Oh man, i know that feeling. You know the haven't been hooked once but they let you die to get the hatch. They don't seem to understand, that we have better chances of survival, if they wait a little before the unhook.
---
Jup and most killers are really surprised and relieved getting a gg wp
---
Check my other video's with her. Like I said, they did this to themselves. I'm a killer, I'm not on their team.
---
I either heal then on hook or take my leave to do a gen if they follow me still. I heal them lol
---
Yea, let's see if they actually show us something new tonight, atleast I think, it's either Tonight or Next Week
---
Well done on saving the other survivor. Surviving yourself was less an accomplishment and more a demonstration of how helpless killers are against some perks during endgame. Still, made for a good clip.
---
is there a problem?  
---
no I'M done here
---
honestly the only way i think you could use it maybe MAYBE aginst borowed time paring it with nurse calling to try to mess with survivors
---
I sometimes try to body block after a survivor is unhooked, but I guess the survivor doesn’t understand I’m trying to help them and they’ll get behind me and go down anyway
---
claudette for self care and dwight im guessing you are a new player you will need there perks
---
that looks really fucking good
---
Yeah, that's why you'd have to wrap some fairy lights around him :D
---
hmm?
---
💕 I hope today was better than yesterday! Super cute! Saving the post!
---
The event is still coming, just later so it's hard to say it's an "absolute" loss
---
My mind immediately jumped to "Arbeit macht frei" when i saw this.
---
Gen rushing is a myth guys
---
Dude this is soo me!😅😅😅
---
That happens when the swf team sucks, but if they are good..they'll escape with like 15k points and you as killer, probably around 13k
---
Getting deliverance and decisive in endgame is an accomplishment in itself. Killer has NOED anyways
---
Oh, so like all bloody and not just bloody shirt? Cool.
---
Although the issue could be anything, I bet there was a problem for one of the consoles.
---
Holy Moly this is stunning !
---
yeah wtf is wrong with people
---
They're just finalizing their Nightmare Before Christmas DLC
---
Ahhh so the killer should just let you leave and go for the uninjured, smart
---
They understand it, they just don't care. The system is pretty easy to figure out.
---
Right now I'm rank 5...maybe just deranked to 6, and I would say 50% of the survivors at this rank don't really deserve it. It's clear to me as games go on that many players just exploit those who are trying to play as a team to get pips.
---
I mean it's not hard to pip or stay neutral. Unhook 2 people and do the equivalent of a gen? That at the very least ensures you don't lose a pip. Unhook 2-3 people and do a couple gens? Probably a pip, and that's really not difficult to pull off. Add in maybe a couple good chases and you guarantee the pip.
---
So what these people do, and it's real scummy, they play super passive until a teammate gets hooked, and then they hook dive them. If they take the hit and get in a chase, that's fine, because that satisfies the requirement of getting in a chase and helps towards their pip, and the game actually sees that unhook as altruistic since you "took the hit for them", when really you were attempting to dick them over.
---
If they get hit instead, the game sees it as you escaping a chase.
---
So maybe after they get hooked, maybe they get away. But after that first dive they've already come very close to meeting requirements to not lose a pip. And if they've already rescued a couple survivors off a hook? They will literally never come get you off a hook, it's only gens and totems from here on out for them.
---
The only time they'll consider it is if they think they still need you to survive and you're close by.
---
I don't run DS, but I'm pretty sure I'm going to start today simply because the amount of survivors that dive literally the second after someone gets hooked.
---
You get the cosmetics yes but lose the perks when resetting
---
Yeah I took a look at them, and it looks like you’ve been playing similarly for roughly a year. 
---
Also, I saw on one of your vids you commented you were a rank 1 killer? I’m calling BS on that.
---
It's glitched? I just figured I hadn't reached 50 yet
---
David cosplaying Cannibal and Feng at the same time.
---
hitting them at the exit with franklin demise make me less sad

Can confirm, am green rank (12 granted) and I have only been here three weeks, am not that good really and know so little that I don't even know what swf means.. Still learning.

Nah, work at a software company and if power goes out our servers will still run in the cloud but only a small portion of the building is on the backup generators.
---
For some reason, my Deliverance doesn't work at all. I tried it in 10 games and self unhook just took me to second stage.
---
Yes. I did safe unhooks and perk was highlighte.
---
No Piggity
---
lol no worries, I'll look when I get off work. Cursed art is always a good time haha
---
Yea that's kinda wack
---
Can you make character portraits for in game use? I'd love to see Survivor and Killer portraits in this style!
---
Its not working for me at all. So many tries and not a single unhook.
---
Two survs DC'd at the start, so as a sign of goodwill I allow them to escape, but the lvl 20 didn't understand and the 16 pops this after I bring him to the hatch. Back to Tbagging Amanda I guess.
---
It happened to me once where demogorgon let me get the hatch, but everyone else wants to watch the world burn
---
If you keep making art styles relates it Dbd, I’ll buy them all
---
Im fairly new to killer rank 20 went to 19. I tjought I was playing fair and alright I didnt camp anyonea just patroling gens. Theae group of survivors kept going back to the same gen over nd over again because it was like 80% done and I wasn't about to let them finish it since they had 2 left. I would go there see a survivor hit him chase for a sec and then hook him up. Would go back to the gen so i can kick it but suddenly another survivor on it. Anyway rinse and repeat 3 timea and none of them left that gen and I eventually hooked all of them except one that got hatch. 
---
At the end of the match I got a ton of shit from all of them claiming camper and tunnler and i saw their ranks were between 10 and 13 while I just got 19.
---
All I did was try to play how its supposed to it wasnt my fault they kept going to the same gen. Now i got 4 comments on my steam about being a noob trash killer?
---
I now get why this survivors are toxic is a meme at thia point.
---
I managed to escape once but that's because I was in front of the exit gate when the killer closed the hatch (he still almost got me as I was escaping)
---
I was. I used Freddy and Legion before they were nerfed. It was easy to gain rank because of constantly stabbing people with frenzy gains uou a lot of points. People couldn't get away from him during that time. And with Freddy, I just slugged and ran thanatrophobia and dying light. So I'd find the obsession and kill them. Making impossible to really do Henson at all without a major struggle. It was easy to get there back then. I'm like around a level 10 now, but I'm a level 7 survivor.
---
Just give every player 1m BP every day until Halloween
---
You have to learn the mind games of what to do at the end as the last person alive. Those who’ve mastered it normally escape.
---
bold of you to assume anyone survives until endgame
---
I don’t care about the events in dbd tbh so I’m easy
---
I mean if you 99 it then pop it as your next to them there's no issue is there?
---
Poor Myers
---
Lol you edited your original post to replace "Stealth" with immersed, and then responded to me as if my question pertained to your edit.
---
Yeah... another simple mind judging people by nothing but something they heard from someone else.
---
The guy who made the meme was grateful about it... rest of you is "protecting" him from becoming better as long as he feels good today 
---
There´s people who want to improve and they are always grateful about non-toxic corrections like mine, wether it´s correcting spelling/grammar or use of memes or just having the wrong info on anything.
---
And now you are here... a hypocritical grammar nazi? What´s better about correcting grammar than correcting use of memes?
---
Apparently you do not correct grammar for the reasons I do, which is helping people to improve. Why is improving someone´s memes not as important as improving someone´s grammar? They both heavilly affect the meaning of what is said.
---
Maybe all of this is too complex for some people or You´re just too young to understand.
---
swapped dead hard for lithe. best decision ever.
---
Monitor and Abuse, Insidious, Iron Grasp, and while I would prefer Ruin, Pop is probably more in character.
---
Even with Noed, there is no way to actually kill the poster except a mori.
---
A killer with 110 percent movespeed.
---
Generally, the ones that have mobility abilities move slower without them.
---
I know who he is, just suprised at the sudden surge of praise posts about him lately when he is been around for a long time.

No. That’s not what I said and I already clarified once that I wasn’t upset about the killers actions. It made the most sense. I was prepared for a loop/chase/attempt get a way.

You’re trying to make it seem like I was a salty survivor for no reason at all, towards the killer.

Yeah, I was on playstation so we didn't get to actually play the event until a week after it came out but i still managed to get the items lol; hope the withered blight isnt as bad

Let me guess u feel bad when u run noed aswel lol not like they can just destroy the totem Wont 
---
be feeling bad then
---
Nancy has moves
---
I feel like DBD is net yet at its full potential but The devs are constantly working to make the game better and we are getting new chapters regularly and new content with each chapter
---
 Generaly speaking, looks like i've just bumped into survivor i just described in the comment before. 
---
 Looks like you have missed the  part when i mention perk "OoO". Most part of my story was about it, and how it affected the balance of the game.  BUT all you noticed is the part with me, camping. I just don't know how to talk to you, guys.
---
 Maybe you don't know what OoO is, and how does it work against stealth killers. Well, then you should go and google it, before replying.
---
It’s fantastic that’s why. Absolutely love this.
---
DLC killer the Sun?
---
New game mode
---
Hey, OP. Can I get the link to your perk icons?
---
Wait so isn't that everyone but Nurse and Huntress?
---
Well don’t know the technical aspect of it but at the moment the amount of hits that happen after pallet drops or window vaults or just hits in general that are way off is insane.  
---
Also the speed after vaulting feels way off. So any loops you could normally do 3 times has been reduced to 2 due to that as well. 
---
Testing if dedicated servers work in live is fine. But test it to see if it can handle all the people and all that. If I wanna test hit boxes and vaulting and what not I’ll join the ptb for that
---
Wrath of the wraith. I love this so much. Is there a way to get high quality images of these to print?
---
Kick the gen and protect it, only chase Survivors if you can hit them within the first few seconds of a chase, then go back to protect the gen.
---
Ill give you an actual lol for that one right there fam
---
That looks awesome dude. Try drawing spirit in pretty sure it’ll look sick
---
not full potential but it tries to be, it can be tough getting the full potential out of things,comparing how the game was 3 years ago i think they've done a lot of good, ya it does take time for them to fix stuff and the game isnt perfect but yet it still has a very active player base with people playing everyday.
---
I'm still working on it. Hes P2 now, but level 25 and that's gonna take a while since I dont have many survivor puddings on anyone.
---
Couldn’t possibly imagine why someone wouldn’t outright say they’re a Nazi after it rightly became unfashionable to be a nazi.
---
It would've costed you $0.00 to not create this.
---
I mean it does need SOME additional function. Even if it's a minor movement speed buff when moving towards someone on the hook.
---
I only play killer, but I watch survivor gameplay too, does that count?
---
Do you think the devs could be doing more or do you think they're already trying their best?
---
Yikes
---
I was mostly just saying that to kinda copy their terminology and point out not all of us (or even most) are happy that it is being delayed
---
"dont lose my time"
---
what
---
He’s one of my favorite killers to play as so I hope he still likes me
---
Thanks, I try to do the same idea with the trapper. I mostly use trapper, and wraith. But after playing the hag she is in my main set now lol.
---
I mean, that is by definition what it is? I didn’t say it was a bad thing. Sometimes it’s the only thing that makes sense.
---
Your assumptions aren’t my problem.
---
I’m calling people who split the game up idiots
---
wait until ps5 release
---
Get a hobby
---
I would never say a luck dependant perk is the best
---
I would buy a Kukri for Legion so fucking fast.
---
Selfcare is pretty useless considering your teammates can heal you as well.
---
This happens EVERY time I go to take a sip of coffee, or if I have an itch. And then when I am 100% focused I don't get skill checks.
---
Its fine, its way better than the old school hatch stand off.
---
It’s actually legal in some places and in some states in the US.
---
Please ask the entity because no one else knows
---
Don't be salty for some negative internet points man :D
---
gotta love clueless survivors
---
*cum
---
Absolutely agree
---
Alternatively, tombstone them with Myers lol
---
The game works perfectly fine for me on my Xbox. Literally the only issue I can think of rn is the occasional frame drop, I have no issues with SWF anymore.
---
Haha köszi! Ritka látni magyar kommentelőket! És nagyon szépen köszönöm :D
---
Thats actually a good perk suggestion amd could be put to testing.
---
Unfortunately.
---
You took what I said out of context, but yeah I have seen quite a few of his comics. He's without a doubt right wing from the comics I have seen. That's not a crime or immoral.
---
even that is not useful. If the killer is actually camping, the hidden marks won't help the unhooked if the killer wants to re-down them.
---
If the killer makes no effort to even come back and is focused on something else, both that effect and the aura reading between said killer and the unhooker is pointless. The benefit of the small aura reading is highly inconsequential in most situations.
---
The perk as a whole has no substantial use over Borrowed Time or We'll Make it for helping others. Not to mention you'll get more use out of Deliverance, and hell even WGLF would be more beneficial for you. This perk is easily the worst unhooking perk in the game.
---
also saying "im not a nazi because i'm not a member of the  National Socialist German Worker’s Party" is the weakest argument in existence lmao
---
Itd be neat if survivors were rewarded with survival points when their teammates disconnect. Or if survivors kept their points, items and offerings when the killer DCs
---
20/10 adorable
---
Downcontentable Load
---
Amazing work!
---
This was posted 4 hours ago. If you're gonna repost, at least wait a little longer...
---
I guess it depends on what killer you are playing. Like if you were Legion you could go ahead and injure them all so they will be too busy mending to do gens and then get one.
---
If doctor you could spam shock the lot of them.
---
If bubba they wouldn't all stand there for sure due to aoe down.
---
If just a plain old killer like trapper or wraith, I'd focus on smacking at least two to let them know you aren't giving chase, then while they're off self healing slowly, focus on downing one after kicking the gen.
---
When you deal with survivors like that, you have to do what I call babysitting...making sure they are all accounted for and too busy with other matters like healing than touching the gens.
---
I agree.
---
Then how am I getting all these 4k's? I play a different way as well. Remember the good old days of insidious LeatherFace? This game is made to play how you feel. There's no rule book on how to kill survivors. Just get the job done.
---
Decisive Punch, you just punch the killer in the face. Stunning them for 0.0005 seconds
---
So how did you know which totem was haunted grounds and which totem was ruin?
---
He already posted here
---
Thats a phat repost cheif
---
surge probably shouldnt have  a cooldown and it should probably take away 15 percent of the generator and have a 50 meter range or it should just apply to the killers terror raduis to go with distressing
---
the only one not being chill here is you tbh 🤣
---
You would stalk too if you came across that many Ahoibois.
---
I get the crux of your point but you wrap it up in so many inaccurate statements. It's not every time you down someone, it's every time you hook someone. **Very** different thing for a variety of reasons.
---
Kicking the generator still takes time.
---
Not being able to Pop already regressing generators is a downside, you present it like a plus.
---
The worse your killer's map pressure is, the worse this perk will be.
---
With that said, I fucking love Pop and run it almost all the time. It's weaker than Ruin though.
---
Same here especially when I have a flashlight and wanna be chased
---
The chase music bug that there was, was when Tinkerer tier 2 was being used, and the chase music and terror radius went away for the rest of the match, but this was fixed a long time ago.
---
I know babysitter needs a lot of work put into it, but increasing the time would definitely be good. Maybe there could be something like a temporary bond with the rescued survivor, and if they take a hit after being hooked, the first hit will apply damage to you instead of the rescued survivor. Still not as good as borrowed time, but would be a major improvement.
---
PS4? Yeah, you'll enjoy DBD a lot more if you set your messages to friends only.
---
Haha nice!
---
Stay fashionable my friend.
---
No. Not really.
---
aww thank you for keeping up, I am doing a lot better! I went to bed early with a headache yesterday, but that also meant I got up early this morning, which actually makes me do something with my day :')
---
Sloppy + Thana is annoying to deal with if Legion can keep pressure on multiple Survivors.
---
STBFL works with Frenzy so you can get multiple tokens.
---
6/10 I love the attention, but haven't even had a public scandal yet
---
Yes
---
Why the fuck is my girl Kate in this disgusting tier?????
---
I'm glad you are doing better! Remember to stay hydrated, it can be a cause for headaches! 💕💕
---
Ah ok thank you have a great day
---
Thank you! I'm planning on making more, though I'm not sure I'll sell stickers. It feels like a big leap to go from hobbyist to actually making some money with it, so I'm a bit intimidated by that lol
---
Poetry my friend
---
Double back lol
---
We did it boys, mind games are no more!
---
Absolutely stunning!
---
Not his sister
---
It specifically happens only in heal skill checks, generators are fine, it’s something weirdly optimized in the game
---
Wack
---
Swamp is the worst map
---
I hate the entire hatch mechanic in general. What a fucking terrible design. Luck based, encourages hatch camping, survivors can circumvent the trial with keys, etc. Just garbage
---
It's not even about this stupid event, the archives and battle pass were coming with it.
---
I rather they go back to having to invite your friend every match, the matchmaking system and exiting back to lobby after a match has been quite broken ever since. But I agree with everything else you said!
---
Hehe. I just had to include that. Ppl get so mad when you double back on ps4 （＾ω＾）
---
Ahoy ladies
---
So make the skill check harder and make it so that even if you hit a good skill check it’s useless, got it counter offer NOED only spawns on totems in sight of survivors and if there are no totems in sight NOED does not activate
---
Most time i've tried to do the 25% pre bulb strat and going it immedietly after the killer goes to check the other one i take one hit then open it and are downed when i go to leave the gate. The times i get to open the gate are 5% and the times in that i escape are probably 1% of that 5%. Maybe i'm just terrible at mindgaming the killer or timing opening with his hearing range but it really feels like if your injured your fucked and if your not injured its a near guaranteed killer win.
---
Which maybe it should be, a killer got a 3k and found the hatch first, maybe that should be a "You had your chance, should of found the hatch first" scenario and its working as intended. I just think that upon last survivor alive, endgame collapse should start with the hatch open with exit gates powered, to allow the killer to make a choice between finding the hatch or guarding the gate. Allows the survivor to actually have a bigger chance in a 1v1 instead of the killer finds the hatch first and wins.
---
She was his sister in the original movies
---
but im not mad though, thats why i put it on shitpost
---
It is the archives the event isn't anything that special, but we get the vials from the rift which we progress through with the archives
---
This perk could actually provide a new form of alultism going out of your way to take blows for others, could make for an imteresting tatic with mettle of man and some other things
---
I think it’s either, that her leg has a little less flesh there on the right hip, or that it’s a bit of an intentional illusion for realism; possibly due to the weapon being partly in the way.
---
Slowing down a killers movement speed does nothing and ds is a punish for people who tunnel NOED is for killers who need to rely on it because they can’t kill anyone otherwise and I have never had a match where every totem was completed before the gates were open
---
How many 😉 will you be sending here
---
1. Walk up to crouched killer
---
2. Hit the button to point (1 on keyboard,  don't know about controllers
---
3. Be extremely happy
---
unless you use actual cheats, there is nothing wrong
---
Boopy!
---
I see, carry on
---
Sadly not. I love DbD so much, (which is why I spent so much of my spare time making those comic posters) but I haven’t played the game for months at this point. Somewhere along the way they’ve lost the spark that made it so thrilling and challenging and unique. But I hope some day they’ll bring it back
---
...no
---
And the killer gets a 60% speed boost as soon as the timer is over
---
Not exactly,  if 3 survivors worked on 3 generated together, it would take a total of 99 second.  If 3 survivors worked on 3 separate, it would take a total of 80 seconds.
---
Niiiiiiiiiiiiice
---
At least he didn’t get an arrow to the knee.
---
Save the best for last
---
Ok, we have Sherlock Holmes, Shrek and u/PonyHit . What kind of fictional character are you, Pony?
---
lol yes it grinds my gears when I'm looping and literally see a teammate or two hiding behind things. like either do a gen, a totem or take the killer for a loop so I can, but don't hide and do nothing.
---
Uh no dude. Matchmaking is based strictly on rank (when it works)
---
r/niceguys 😂
---
Kate.
---
Freddy is the ultimate nice guy
---
Sounds like salt to me.
---
It depends on how you want to play. Spirit and Clown have different playstyles and you should choose the one that most fits you. If you want an easier game,  go Spirit. She has good gen pressure if you play her correctly.
---
Why was no one working on a gen
---
not really but whatever you say
---
Interesting idea! You could use the Unique Wedding Ring add-on with Mettle of Man and Boyfriend to ensure you’re not the obsession and also score some easy protection hits. Would also work well with We’re Gonna Live Forever
---
Imagine Freddy letting the survivors finish gens
---
Salty players, ignore them
---
I don’t know any lol. I think it was all the salt they want to spew.
---
She thiccccccc
---
People tend to forget that Ghostface can’t be revealed while leaning. Or, at least, not easily.
---
So what if the killer also brought party streamers? Would that 500% because if so I would try to get my friends to 4 stack and get are killer main friend to farm
---
Is their like a bloodpoints multiplier attached to this because really see an upside other than the aura seeing and even then you could just use empathy.
---
AHHHHH
---
Make third seal work on jigsaw boxes and suddenly it makes the perk and pig better
---
Kate
---
“If they don’t clen—*thunder*”
---
This is a freakin good painting
---
Such a pointless post... get over it and move on.
---
I still don't really know the point of STBFL if my goal is to kill.
---
“But You Get A Free Frogurt”
---
"Nice camp."
---
"I never camp alone."
---
"I don't get it."
---
They never do. They never do.
---
Plus it goes against his perk of dying light
---
You leave the obsession to last so that you can keep stacks to hit and kill faster, what's hard to understand?
---
True, but you could also use Aftercare, Dark Sense, Object of Obsession or Blood Amber on a key. 
---
It’s just a fun perk to give you some extra information while adding a new layer to the obsession mechanic.
---
Ugh for real. SWF doesn't automatically mean a bad gameeeee
---
All trying to be altruistic. They failed and in such a short time span. If I saw that going down, I'd wait until the killer would pick someone up. I wouldn't rush in right away. But they did, and I made them pay for it.
---
If you would’ve missed th ds I would’ve laughed so hard
---
Laurie! He's just trying to be nice!
---
Feed off them
---
It's the mask you get if you have Deathgarden, it's been in the game since that game was first revealed but for obvious reasons it's still very uncommon to see in dbd.
---
Remember when Jane's with got took when she was moried by Myers? 
---
Laughed my ass of seeing it for the first time.
---
I like to use the downtime to look at porn so at least I’m in the mood before I get fucked brutally by the 4 man swf I get when I finally get a lobby.
---
Because with dying light, I'd I get rid of the obsession fast, then the rest are penalized and they struggle to get gens done because of the penalty. So if you were playing adept with him, they don't run smoothly together if you really think about it.
---
You can use it on legion to cheese the mend
---
I'ma gf main and I remember seeing a blue hair nea with a flashlight and would teabag or flashlight me after she threw pallets. Let's just say I got some hate messages for teabagging her while she was on the hook
---
ya got outplayed XD
---
I encourage everyone to also check out fungoose on YouTube... You should see him explain his games as he plays, it’s unreal! He deserves to be more popular than he currently is, his survivor and killer matches are incredible and super informative.
---
xd
---
Love how the blood’s purple
---
as a ~~furry~~ pig main, this is too freakin cute
---
i love your chibi art style!!!
---
That's actually quite educational for newbie killers. What to do when you go around a shack and overall corners.
---
Wtf is deathgarden and how much is it so I can get the mask. Also I play on ps4 so if deathgarden is pc only i'ma be pissed
---
You need to think about it from their perspective. Imagine creating an event from a content-hungry community. The pressure is so dense you can cut it with a butter knife. You and your team make the wise decision to delay a large content update so you can all make sure that this update is as bug-free as you can make it within a limited amount of time. Then, suddenly, a power outage, something outside of your control, occurs as you’re nearing the end of the bug fixing process, which deletes all of your progress. Instead of understanding the situation and being patient, the community hammers you down and tries to make you feel like a dick because you tried to make your content better but ended up failing because of something that was out of your control. Do you see how shitty that is? Do you understand?
---
That could probably be done, but I'm not sure if that would help much if it's only when cleansing a totem (cuz of how the perk works it would more than likely only apply to hex totems)
---
I just say GG and immediately leave these days. I got called a tunneler because this dipshit would get unhooked, and immediately stand still and try and flashlight me.
---
Well you must boop of the snoot of the killer family pet
---
Her counterplay lies more than in one perk, she lacks the ability to see you, only hear you, so use it to your advantage. Drop pallets during phase to confuse, walk instead of run, direct stratchmarks towards one place and move away from it. Seriously if you look at streamers who play both sides, they've learned how to counter spirit because they learned how to play her. You say a perk should never be a counter play but the same 4 perks should never be a counter play to every killer in the game, mix up your build, dance with me, quick and quiet, deadhard, iron will, all very strong vs her but people want to constantly run, adrenaline, DS, borrowed, ect all the time. It's a learning curve to go against her which will feel a million times better when you do outplay her compared to running around a loop you can see the killer at for 10 minutes. Just for once adapt.
---
Sbeve
---
the fact that that implies the person you are crushing on is married is amazing XD
---
Anti tunnel perk.
---
The salt did taste good lol
---
New perk unbalanced landing, when jumping down, your face meets the ground
---
He looks like Bill from TLOU.
---
Yes. All 5 bps equals +500% bonus BP. Then If you had wglf/bbq and if this happened during a bloodhunt you would be at +700% or 8x the normal BP amount. Then if you farm so everyone gets 32k that's 32 x 8 =256k BP from one game
---
MYC nurse is the worst thing I've gone against. But that was last year because nobody plays nurse on ps4 at rank 8's
---
Wraith hit while cloaked...? I’m confused.
---
You mean First Hassan
---
#DOKODA
---
whatever you say
---
What ever you say
---
Well if generators are fine on pc than you still shouldnt have issues with ruin
---
Welp, I know what I'm doing during the next bh. That's if I can find bloody party streamers and convince my  friends to redownload dbd
---
Yeah, its sad
---
This is reddit.
---
Anyone that doesn't believe in the far left, is automatically a Nazi.
---
Even me, a liberal will be called a Nazi.
---
It's just Reddit my dude.
---
Idk if stonetoss is a Nazi or not, I enjoy some of his comics, and I dislike some of his comics.
---
I don't see any Nazi messages in them, but hey, that makes me a Nazi cuz dog whistles that only the far left hears
---
Deathgarden is on ps4, it's another game made by BHVR that is essentially dbd but games are faster, the killer has a gun, the game is objective worse, and perks do nothing. Also parkour is involved. In all honesty the core gameplay can be fun but there isn't enough variety to hold you beyond maybe an hour or two. In dbd you can get tons of characters and perks but in deathgarden it takes like 2 seconds and they don't actually change much of anything
---
I was more referring to your bad computer comment more than the ruin thing.
---
Such a sad comment
---
Yea, Nancy's are good at least. Demogorgon's look like they CAN be ok after minor number tweaks, otherwise they are pretty bad currently. Steve's are all trash though...
---
I think he was making a joke about how you spelled Immersive with an "n".
---
Imagine a nurse/spirit/billy with 24/7 ruin... That's a big no no
---
No hard feelings dude, I'm glad you understand! \^\^
---
Have you, by chance, heard it in a kinky bondage porn film? And which one?
---
Meg for quick and quiet and adrenaline
---
Are you actually asking for an answer? If you are: Entitlement
---
It's gotta be a bug of some sort.. I'll be playing and DC even though nothing else disconnects (IRC, slack, discord, etc). And at least half of my games involve another player DC'ing.
---
balanced landing ftw
---
Unforeseen circumstances
---
Cant be bothered, cya
---
Eirri is the best! 
---
Myers is like the new gramps lol
---
You have a flare of the gods
---
Vomit on everything. By this I mean pallets, windows, totems and generators. 
---
If someone cleanses, take advantage of that. Suck it up, get that corrupt bile and focus down the survivors. 
---
Hex: Ruin is very helpful to slow down gen progression with Plague. It’s definitely helpful if you end up getting a hold of it.
---
Chibi Pig is best pig
---
Yeah dude, not like you can sit AFK on gens for the first 3.5 minutes of the match and leave against every Killer that's not Nurse.
---
I found it once in a literal corner of the map along the wall. Pretty awful spot.
---
You put that on every comment that calls you out and you have no response lmao
---
You really don't have to buy it. It's all cosmetic shit and there's a free track. Not sure what's too complicated to understand here.
---
he is speaking the language of the gods
---
I just find it to be a very niche perk personally. Not being able to see where someone is hooked is negligible as long as you’re paying attention since the black circle still pops up. You don’t often see survivor aura perks like bond, empathy, OoO or aftercare being run often enough to consider countering them. And since blindness doesn’t really do anything else, it’s best use is for slug builds but I think I’d rather just run knockout since third seal could be (and let’s be honest probably will be) broken.
---
Calls me out, lol i keep telling them that im not salty but they insist that i am. So i give up, cant be bothered to deal with single minded fools
---
oh you're approaching me? instead of running away?
---
Honestly, its not a bad idea, maybe a little too overpowered but if BHVR were to take it i have no doubt they could balance it better
---
Sis, why is my hot fudge sundae always fucking cold then? Make that shit when the cleaning process happens.
---
pitch a fucking tent
---
"Single minded" - You're the only one thats single minded, getting triggered at every person that goes against your opinion. Yet you wonder why people call you salty
---
Has anybody noticed that it feels like clown and nurse's pick up animations feel faster or at least the part where you get them on ur shoulders is faster?
---
Yeah, the main point is the idea, not the numbers, because like that killers will have 100% sure of early pressure and survivors won't be idle doing nothing
---
@Claudette
---
You want to give one of the best killer perks a huge buff?
---
&gt;every 
---
So basically if he hits you once and he has dream snares you're screwed the rest of the chase.
---
Ok, I am going to assume you're joking lol 
---
But just in case somehow you really dont know... there is only 5 players. 4 survivors 1 killer.
---
But what about good ole me, a survivor main? I mean, technically I disagree with OP that not everything here is salt about toxic survivors but I think there are quite a few survivor mains here.
---
9k shards can only get one or the other
---
Its killer sided my dude, Stay on one side and patrol the 3 gens and that's at least a 3k
---
Fellow killer main here, rank 18, 
---
They are cunts
---
Where in my post am i complaining dude
---
This is definitely not the case. Its very split.
---
But they are doing it, if slowly, while constantly pushing out new content.
---
But another redditor answered a similar comment of mine with everyone can have their own opinion, and that's true. Sorry for this little rant-like comment of mine, got a bit fed up with all the complaining comments
---
You have to think about low ranks, this would make games impossible for them.
---
Make that it's 20 base tokens through all levels and great skillchecks won't consume any token, so survivors have to open hand of their progress speed to get rid of it or just "gen rush" to make it faster, any perk should "last through all match", the ones that does last that long aren't that strong.
---
Whats the problem again? Just seems like more bitching over dedicated servers. How original
---
Legion mains rise up
---
Rule34
---
I dont ignore people, but if they come talking shit well ill just say i cant be bothered talking to them. And looks like you're the same type of single minded fool as them, its sad.
---
i am a bell main you can imagine xd
---
Camping the corner with insidious so no one gets points, oh yeah...it's big brain time.
---
You can grind from 0 doing SWF or Solo. What you say is a different discussion.
---
“I dont agree with you so your opinion is wrong”
---
Novaween, definitely.
---
if u r not in a chase and asleep, u can run through them to get rid of them
---
Bruh the two add on which suppress the radius and silence the bell = op
---
Trapper is always daddy.
---
Always.
---
Why do I torture myself and play console dbd :(. These are amazing. What I wouldn't give to have this on my version lol.
---
We better have the whole event have double BP. This delay is bullshit.
---
If you are out in the open, use your saw. If there is a pallet or window nearby, normal hit them. Play with your good is great on him since it allows him to close the distance quicker. Good add ons I run on him are the carburetor tuning guide and beast marks, the grease and tuning guide, and tuning guide with primer bulb. Tuning guide is good on him, in case you were wondering. Also, you do not have to run forward while chainsawing. You can stop to avoid corners and bumps to prevent tantruming. If someone goes in a locker, rev you chainsaw and hit the locker. If they get out they get hit. If not, spam open to catch them, or hit m1 as soon as they get out to grab.
---
Something that does bother me is the entitled survivor mentality, as if killers aren't allowed to have any strong killers, good perks, maps in killers favor, etc. 
---
This game already heavily favors survivor; anyone who plays killer and survivors can see that.
---
At least we can all agree on dev incompetency.
---
Yet here you are again replying to my comment. 
---
So what exactly was the point in telling me you cant be bothered?
---
honestly so true on many levels
---
Im not triggered, but looks like you are since you keep commenting. Againts my opinion? what opinion all theyre doing is telling me im salty when im not and thats the only thing they think. So yeah single minded fools, like you
---
Depending on the placement of the snares, sometimes you can run around them and still make the loop. Or just vault earlier than you normally would, since it’s going to be a slower vault. 
---
If it’s a high walk loop and you see him place a trap, wait til he goes one way and then just take off and leave the loop. You can always spring his trap later when you aren’t being chased.
---
If they can't provide evidence then how do you distinguish fact from opinion?
---
Yep. Stay awake.
---
I thought only Leatherface ate his victims
---
Aww, i'm sorry about that :( 
---
Thanks &lt;3
---
I mean,most of the Claudette's are immersed,thats a fact.But you have even youtubers like Ussylis (aka best DBD player) that plays Claudette,survivors are all the same,is just which one you like most.Every killer has an unique power,but survivor its like whatever.
---
Exactly. Stay awake.
---
I can think of one content creator in general who has stated on multiple occasions that he really doesn't like DBD in its current state, but will keep playing it to make money.
---
Me myself on the other hand... It's like Stockholm Syndrome. There are times I hate this game, but... I just can't help coming back every single day lmao.
---
Spirit 1000%. She’s a top tier killer, arguably the best in the game right now. She’s extremely fun to play too.
---
Oh because you're saying something else apart from, "youre salty". But if you want you can go back to telling me im salty, ill gladly stop responding if you want
---
Mate,he is a nazi.
---
Look at all the replies with evidence.
---
don’t encourage him
---
Oh so my opinion doesnt count, nice
---
Got them
---
Get PGTW now and buy spirit later.
---
not really because they can loop you and if they see you you have nothing really
---
Rank?
---
Ashy Slashy, but it's killers instead of Ash
---
Please say you’re kidding
---
Are you prestiged?
---
Im a rank 9 almost 8
---
The plague must’ve been hot as fuck before the plague
---
I didnt say that. I called you out for that embarrassing comment where you just copied what I said. And no you wont. Your fragile little ego wont allow you to.
---
I don't know I find more Piggies too. Interesting that these killers are resurfacing and I am fine with that, every killer is fun to go against except spirit for right now, until I can properly learn her when against her I should be okay.
---
Nia fa hong gin gia. Oko veh
---
Again absolutely adorable!!! &lt;3
---
That sounds like a back-to-back copy of Deathgarden..
---
I'd say it was a misclick.
---
Please use /s if you were joking.
---
Yes!
---
You can't get extra healing speed past 100%. Botany is near useless.
---
I don’t play mobile but it’s probably in the daily rituals tab
---
I got a Pig mask recently. Couldn't help but boop the snoot repeatedly on the drive home.
---
The only thing that would make him a nazi is if he created those red panel comics.
---
Then what else are they supposed to play, Casual? lol
---
The Frogurt is also cursed...
---
Honestly I really love this art style
---
You realize you can pick them up if you face away from the window
---
Steve, then pair it with Head On and shout “Henderson” every time you stun the killer.
---
Set off snares while you are free to. If the player is good at placing snares mid-chase, using 2 or 3 around loops and knowing how to zone you into them, yes, then you just need to drop the pallet early against them, just like you have to against Clown. If you have enough distance you can sometimes still make one loop by running around the snare(s), however.
---
It cant there are no mods !
---
But nothing beats how cute Amanda is
---
I think it's the "select" button there
---
&gt;A good player would need to assess the situation and react accordingly.
---
Telling that to a new player is as useful as saying saying 'Git gud'. I explained how the mechanics works and how it's geared towards working on individual generators.
---
As a killer, it's easy to pressure a generator that is 80% done. It's hard to pressure two generators that are 40% done. Splitting up is usually the best choice. This is why the offering for killers that splits up the spawns of survivors 'Shroud of seperation' is never used by any competent killer.
---
Didn't expect MMA related memes here.  I was just reading that Nate Diaz pissed hot. I cri
---
Yeah- Ghostface, the broken killer who will get fucked over relentlessly by Spine Chill and might as well disconnect if Object of Obsession is brought in. That Ghostface?
---
I got facecamped in purple ranks by a ghost face after I ran him for two gens (it was the the beginning of the game, those two gens are easy, it wasn’t that long), in endgame chat no one said a thing (I stayed because I’m salty but I don’t usually flame in chat) and he started a rant on genrushers and how he hates them and that’s why he camped. Wut?
---
Edit: typo
---
What you don’t know is that’s his only hex totem and it’s Thrill of the Hunt.
---
Ok, I see. They changed it. It used to be a huge penalty when the obsession died. When was that change made?
---
Since you're too stupid and ignored it allow me to repeat it for you, i said i cant be bothered to comment since all they talked about was that im salty. Now are you gonna keep commenting stupid shit?
---
I wish I’d get more variety in killers. I’m red rank survivor on PS4 and the most common killers I’ve seen this week are Trappers (for some reason) and Spirits.
---
My thing is if a survivor is injured and I’m in a chase I’ll stay on them, if one of their friends shows up it is more advantageous for me to hit their friend and chase them I’ll do it.
---
I'm dying, it's so cute!
---
They should do double bloodpoints to make up for all the bugs, errors, disconnects and losing everything
---
Hahaha
---
Legion's been disowned. I have the feeling you hate Legion too.
---
Fuck dude.. we forgot to put the "/s" now we get downvoted :( big sad.
---
I would totally wait because this style is amazing, keep up the good work!
---
4a) If it’s a Pig, prepare to be let go. 
---
4b) If for some reason it’s a Ghostface, prepare to get the big stab.
---
srry but what is mma?
---
K thx
---
Nope.  None of my survivors/killers are.
---
That's fast
---
Well everyone claims they’re a bad set of killers they are fun to play but bad.
---
._.
---
It’s a generator being completed. Everybody is alerted anyway.
---
They’re not teachables anymore
---
November 4th
---
How can you play on mobile? I can't find it in the playstore
---
Let's agree to disagree :)
---
Calling out you're fragile ego cause you said cya and then keep replying? 
---
Just prove me wrong and stop replying.
---
I mean you wont cause as I mentioned you have the most fragile ego I have come across and it wont allow you to just walk away.
---
You sad little fucker.
---
Prove me wrong.
---
Agreed.
---
Scoopy boi is a great meme, but Kate’s skin is very cool.
---
I think the basement shouldn’t be on boat, it just feels wrong
---
These are amazing
---
Did the Clown still have collision with the vault?
---
Holy shit.
---
I have no idea why that happened but it allowed me to distract Bubba for most of the trial
---
Country girl
---
No, you are just misunderstanding the situation.
---
If it's not for you, then you don't buy it. It's 10 bucks or so, and you don't have to buy it until the end of you are worried about not getting all your cells back, but it's worth it after you get 1 or 2 sets of cosmetics, plus you get a lot of other stuff.
---
Wtf
---
Are you sure?
---
I believe it was early September but I could be wrong.
---
Why is Ghostface unfair?
---
That's the only way he can be scary or stealthy
---
Good if you don't get the unhook though. And can pick up a slugged person faster.
---
Pm me, i ll help you there ;)
---
I mean this is my post, the one that keeps commenting is you, so idk if you're trying to defend your fragile ego
---
I don't see how changing the nurse and a battle pass that AIN'T MANDATORY are scummy practices. You don't deserve a hallowed blight event.
---
Gotta go fast 
---
But seriously I got this glitch like a month and a half ago and felt like a god 
---
I kept running circles around the spirit, while she was just spinning in circles at me 
---
Eventually the glitch stopped and she downed me (as she should because I’m sure what I did was pretty toxic)
---
Thankfully the spirit was friendly and we both had a good laugh about it 
---
Wasn’t trying to be a dick by the way, just wanted to meme and be silly (everyone else was already dead)
---
If you're waiting 5 minutes and someone quits its because they didnt load in, its non-voluntary
---
His tantrum actually has an active hitbox. If you're trying to "Locker-Juke" Hillbilly-style it won't work and usually puts you in a lose-lose situation where you have to choose between jumping out into a maniac flailing a chainsaw around or getting grabbed out of the locker since when this happens and I'm bubba I'm mashing the check locker key like crazy during the tantrum.
---
I did
---
Shhh don t tell them.
---
His tantrum was going on when I jumped in the locker and got hit in the locker.
---
Yea, illoked it up. It was in september. Why the hell did they change it? It helped my last match, but I swore I was using it the old way... lol. That poor obsession I beat down for no reason lmao.
---
I just wanted to point out that Deathgarden didn’t do very well, so they actually scrapped it and rebuilt it from the ground up. I played the new version not long ago and I kind of enjoyed it.
---
I knew that name sounded familiar! I loved her Gramps comics.
---
Jesus christ. All you had to do was not reply and you literally cant. Fuck me man, you're just the most pathetic creature I've come across. 
---
Watch and learn you sad sad little thing.
---
Look how inferior this Jamesface is...he has to look up to the ascended Nea.
---
Dwight would probably be stuck in the closet. *Badumtish*
---
Just press M1 to win
---
When I said not necessarily, I meant the part where you said "overall slower", because it isn't. Not always, anyways, for the reasons I stated above.
---
&gt; I find it's easy to pressure a generator that is 80% done in order to prevent it from popping.
---
Yes, assuming you get to the gen before it pops, which is not always a guarantee unless you have Discordance, Tinkerer, or any other similar gen related perk.
---
Disgusting, in the good way the plague is .....so its amazing !
---
you take memes way too seriously
---
Imagine being able to hit skill checks
---
Dont you worry, i dont give, i only take.... I DEVOUR !
---
Bing
---
So does this "fragile ego" thing work for you normally?
---
That was correct
---
Actually my comments were towards someone else's comments about how we expect killers to play by "our" handbook when they have one just as well.
---
A lot of YouTubers/streamers say they hate the game either as a joke or in a fit of rage. It’s pretty hard to hate the game since, well... it’s just a solid game. Plenty of bugs and balance issues, not to mention all the toxicity those two things cause, but besides that, it’s pretty good.
---
laurie strode is his sister
---
Pants shirt face for survivors iirc
---
Exactly. Unfortunately, I'm seeing some people saying "Delete the archives and leave the nurse's base kit alone." Uh, u/yiranjaguro, you're lucky you're getting an event. How about you shut up?
---
When does it drop?
---
Except that’s not a huntress that’s Michael cat fishing as huntress.
---
Turns out running in your dreams does not count as cardio.
---
What happens when 5 people use party streamers and one of then gets 4 iridescent medals?
---
maybe a Toot toot?
---
*gay bondage*
---
She looks sick! 
---
Good job.
---
Stay awake, and/or avoid taking multiple passes at the same loop, which is a helpful skill to learn anyways
---
Yeah I thought that was apparent
---
For killer sure but for survivor GOD NO as someone with a lot of experience (been playing since 2017) if you don't play with people in an swf you will have an unfun time. This is because good games can suddenly be ruin by just unlucky teammates, like for example I had a game were I ran the killer around for 3 minutes and no gens got done, when I went down I saw that everyone was just hiding all game. Things like this will happen often and will really ruin your experience. Howeveeeer, there are ways to get people to play with you, pick up people who play well in your lobbies, use the campfire meetup threads, use the deadbydaylight lfg, use the discord lfg. There are ways to get people to play with you outside of having freinds. Getting people you have hand chosen to play with you will automatically make this game more consistently fun to play as a survivor. 
---
Short answer: no lol
---
Fuck ♂️ You ♂️
---
Plot twist it’s haunted grounds
---
Fantastic post haha. 
---
Tapp always finishes the job though, let’s be clear about that.
---
I'm pretty sure it just gives devs the ability to add crossplay so we'll have to wait for an update, but I'm not positive
---
The worse part is after the Undetectable buffs to stealth killers it will be even worse!
---
There is no cooldown on the snares, but he can only have a limited amount placed at one time, so once he reaches his max (I think it’s 8) then the oldest traps will disappear.
---
Weapon, body, head for killer
---
Saddly its not there :( and cannot find anywhere :(
---
it looped and i thought the problem was rubberbanding XD
---
I'd still use it
---
Legs, torso, head for survivors
---
Weapon, body, head for killers
---
I get it’s overpowered in brown ranks where skill checks are never hit but in red ranks it wouldn’t really be op
---
Bing bong is precious, we need to protect him.
---
You shouldn’t feel bad for running Ruin. If anything, you should feel confident because you won’t be gen rushed (unless the totem is in a bad spot). I’m certain that, at your rank, you’ve had games less than 10 minutes long. It’s just something we all have to do. If you don’t want to run it, that’s fine, but I and many other fellow killer mains suggest you run it or any other gen-slowing perk like Pop or Corrupt Intervention.
---
Also, how does one get bullied by hex totems?
---
As a person who has worked on games, people need to understand that behind the game are people with lives, families and at the end this is their job and they definitely aren't laughing when they get encounter the bugs and see all the internal deadlines and the pressure from the community.
---
They know they need to fill expectations and be active or their game will loose audience and eventually "die" and some if not many will loose their job.
---
They also know they have to keep their sanity and weight the consequences of their actions. Better a delay than a possible weeks of fatal crashes.
---
I bet they're stressed the heck out about the it and the power outage. They probably even with backup loose things, files got corrupted. Hell maybe the implementation of code that worked great with each programmer now that is together it just crashes. 
---
I'm aware of the frustration of some and the memeing is a way to pass time and have fun. But there's a saying in my country that says "Between joke and joke, the truth shows". I'd like to believe there are only a few who really hold hate for the devs and the others are only annoyed, but sometimes only seeing that kind of posts here it's quite frustrating.
---
I only hope the people in BHVR aren't "crunching" but if they are (that tbh is still a very common thing in the videogame industry) they're getting paid and have days to rest after... I remember when in my previous job they only wanted to paid the extra time with pizza and beer.
---
The amount of conditions required for new perks is just stupid. Why does fixated have the old Urban Evasion condition? Didn't they learn from last time? Why does mindbreaker only work on half the gen? Why does surge have a cooldown? Why does second wind require a FULL heal on top of not working with deliverance?
---
They said they will let us know later today on Twitter
---
Not going to lie, *that* scene with Hawkeye and Black Widow actually got me to cry while watching the movie.
---
A friend of mine was bawling through the entire movie though.
---
That's lame. I thought the last one was. There was a survey on the forums that either they or a user did for "what we're excited for about the event" and extra bloodpoints was one
---
Droop the snoot.
---
Well guys I went to negative karma from one post. Dope（⌒▽⌒）
---
*torso, legs, head
---
So, if someone don't play at 60 fps and have fps issues, fuck that person, right? New players? Fuck them right? No mate, ruin shouldn't be base game, skillchecks are big for a reason: help New players, great skillchecks are small for a reason: reward good players
---
Yes, I'm sure. It's why you don't (or shouldn't at least) use a medkit while healing with we'll make it.
---
It's not so much for survivor to know where they are though I suppose a lot of players might use to instigate a chase away from the hurt survivors.
---
Alert is a much better perk to have for killer detection, tbh. Works even if the killer is stealthed and has infinite range. Helps me dodge new Freddie all the time. (If he is gen hopping to break them I can tell if he is facing my gen for a teleport before the blood starts pumping out of it)
---
I love it how entitled Survivors feel like they ought to escape every round. When Killers shouldn't do their job properly in killing them. Calling them out for camping and such to ensure a kill. Its  like being in  a horror film where there is no gore or scary parts of the movie and the killer just sits there in a corner doing nothing. I mean how boring would that be if the killer did NOT KILL ANYONE? Its a killer's job to kill and a Survivors' job to attempt escape, it doesn't mean their entitled to escape every single match.
---
How much is it? I was thinking of getting it
---
The killer could have completely ignored the guy and put the other dude on a hook.
---
The killer lost because he was bad, not because perks are too powerful.
---
This. All this perk does is make survivors break it immediately if you have one or more running aura perks or simply want the points. Otherwise they just wait for the hook. Knockout is way better for slugging and can be paired with Infectious to ensure no one is near by to see the slugged person.
---
I want to like 3rd Seal, but it seems to just have a bit of shock factor and that's it.
---
its my fetish
---
You're right, that's what I meant, sorry lol
---
&gt;You can't get extra healing speed past 100%
---
This is false info. If you're going by the perk description, you shouldn't assume it means all extra healing speed. We'll make it only prevents **its** healing bonus from exceeding 100%. [We'll make it still stacks with other healing bonuses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjWLd5D5mqE&amp;t=140s)

With those teachables i would go bbq, disco, haunted ground, ruin.
---
Suggest getting pig for surv and myc
---
She probably gives the best hugs.
---
Especially if you're about.... 5'10" or so.
---
Yes, but what makes the pass worth spending real money on it?
---
The cosmetics sprinkled throughout it.
---
I'll give you time to put it all together in a way that makes the most sense to you.
---
Thanks
---
Rank 6 here, lots of bubba's. All very tunnely/campy/annoying.
---
I would assume a horror game would milk horror month for all it's worth instead of waiting for the ass end of it to deliver 3 hours of event time.
---
I love all of them but I feel I feel the biker Kate variation is the best.  The smirk and that outfit just screams "YOU'RE gonna chase me, but I'M gonna make you regret it."
---
See you say you’re not triggered but clearly I’ve got under your skin. If you don’t come across as if we’ve offended you then we might not think you’re salty. But you just help prove our point
---
Ghostface is ridiculously broken by the dedicated servers dude, what are you on about? Stalking at all effectively anymore is nearly impossible because you can't lean for shit.
---
And are you know, human and capable of making mistakes just like the rest of us. I know we would all prefer a delay then a game breaking glitch that might even prevent us playing full stop. It must have bern serious for them to cancel with no notice surely?
---
Whatever you say bud, good for you
---
All right, thanks. I'll just grind today I guess lmao.
---
On steam it’s in early access for $14.99. The deluxe edition was about $37. It’s currently only on pc. You can look for more details [here](https://www.deathgardengame.com/en)
---
No guns are needed for him. He could have something like whenever you are approaching a gen,  you suppress your terror radius. Then, when you are close to a wall near the gen, you can channel your power to bust through certain walls/terrain like a Terminator. I imagine the cool-down and speed of this ability is is buffed while in endo-skeleton mode.
---
you don't outplay anyone by using a key either
---
I never said they werent allowed to play whoever they want
---
I just said its annoying going against leatherface 5 times in a row
---
Can someone link their account? I'm hiding in a locker rn and can't do it now.
---
Ngl she pretty hot
---
No one accused you of saying that. You wanted a reason so I gave you the reason
---
The devs don't deserve any REAL hate but there is always room for legit criticism. Halloween falls around the same time every year, the dates don't change. Having a whole year to slowly plan the event at least in part until your a few months away then really ramp up your work on the update. Most people can be understanding of for example: delayed games that need a little more polish or a major update that needs a few more bugs worked out but a Halloween event that only runs for a week and gets delayed until "TBD" deserves a little negative feedback and criticism.
---
thanks :)
---
LMAO, that's literally the most embarrassing shit ever.
---
Very great! I was just thinking about Alien DLC the other night too!
---
How the fuck is tombstone op it's literally 100% de pip so you know a loss
---
[Here's a very comprehensive Leatherface guide.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXPkDb5n4bU) from /u/int3r4ct which I found pretty helpful. Some things were changed since the video game out (Mainly the chainsaw hit/miss cooldown shortened so your hit cooldown is as short as the miss cooldown) though but it's still up to date. (Although the Chili addons seem to affect cornering a little)
---
Your chainsaw is VERY hard to hit survivors with. IMHO there is no shame in running NOED on him due to his lack of mobility, pressure, and having an instadown so hard to land he might as well be an M1 killer. Go for M1 hits in the middle of loops. I only chainsaw if I'm right up against the survivor's back in the open since unlike Hillbilly you slow down drastically when revving your saw, meaning unless you're at point blank range you're gonna whiff.
---
In terms of addons I recommend the often-hated-on-hillbilly "Instasaw" combo (Tuning Guide + Primer Bulb) for the fastest charge up. Double speed addons (Knife Scratches + The Beast's Marks) make your chainsaw take way too long to charge up, (And remember, you move slower than survivors when revving, so more time revving = more distance the survivor will gain from you) but you can rocket forward pretty fast and it's amusing to "Slingshot" (Slow down a ton revving, then suddenly rush up and hit them) survivors with it. 
---
My Leatherface build I forgot. I think it's BBQ, NOED, Ruin, and Bamboozle, but you could run something like BBQ, NOED/Ruin, Enduring, Spirit Fury.
---
As someone who regularly hit red rank survivor but only does daily for killer, I can say that post-game lobby salt is a LOT worse by those survivors in the double digit ranks. They think they are better than they really are, and have a lot of toxicity as a result.
---
Thanks, I appreciate that comment
---
Thank you for the lovely comment!
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dmzzbf/so_i_encountered_this_interesting_yet_game/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
:(
---
I did something like this the other day. I was on The Game and did ok. The exit gates were powered as I finished up a chase and I just camped the hook. I was able to down 2 survivors with one chainsaw swing because they just had to get the unhook. The third guy revealed himself in this time and I was hot on their tail. They 99’d the gate so they tried to finish opening it but they ate my chainsaw instead.
---
I told my SWF buddy to get moried as I killed myself on hook right when she came up to unhook me lol
---
It was someone with full devour hope and we couldn't find the totem lol
---
So you don’t give a shit about rookies then and want them to quit because they literally cannot stop a killer perk designed to stoppable?
---
- Tru3talent bad
---
:( I just wanna be special too. It's cold and dark in the console verse.
---
I did this as a lvl 7 wraith. I ran no addons and only thrill of the hunt and this one feng kept going for the totem and giving me free hits. I somehow got a 3k that game.
---
She's my main and she is sexy good job awsome
---
You do realize the reason the event was delayed were not solely due to the mentioned reason but because they forgot they had to ship the event with the rift for it to be possible to make progress as such even delayed untill mid chapter patch. It's sad really that you are spreading this miss information.
---
Tldr event delayed because they forgot you get serums from the rift as such the event was postponed so it was actually possible.
---
They posted a statement saying they’re delaying the event, see the pinned post
---
Grinding bloodpoints to unlock BBQ since there was recently a sale on all DLC, maybe?
---
You can... get up th- never mind let him be happy
---
Dude, seriously sounds like you need to play a few games as killer to actually understand what they do. Because we are, in fact, PLAYING A GAME FOR FUN, not because we’re going on some power trip (at least, that’s not why I play it). Sorry if your killer instances have been unpleasant, but to just shoehorn them all into one category is highly unfair.
---
Mixed Martial Arts
---
This isn't a joke... This is just something that happens lmao
---
A little research would help.
---
There is halloween event with the new feature call the achiever.
---
But it is buggy right now so they will delay the event.
---
Oh okay, do you know if any if the skins will be phurchasable with in game earned credits, or where I can fond that
---
I agree lol
---
https://imgur.com/a/eGA4ADB
---
So I encountered this interesting yet game breaking bug. I got stuck like this for the entire game after being healed. I could heal others and others could heal me. The killer could hit me ang get me in the dying state, but he couldn't grab me.
---
He opened the hatch to get the timer started, but even that didn't kill me so I had to DC to end the game. Fun times.
---
Only time I use a Mori is if I have a daily to kill someone. Then it's only a green or yellow.
---
I’ll call you the arc is right. 
---
Window in. Survivor out.
---
Oh shit i meant DISADVANTAGE I'll edit that
---
Discussions and sharing. Questions that cant be answered by anything by google like how to use certain builds and such.  I'm not trying to be mean but a lot of people seem to be asking simple question and then acting a little rude when I answer them or dont give them the answer they want.
---
Perhaps it’s in the rewards tab?
---
No pc
---
WHAT
---
This community sometimes bruh...
---
Damn it I play on ps4. Do you know when it might be on ps4?
---
Your first mistake was choosing legion lol
---
Pig dlc on sale on steam rn.
---
Just run PGTW.
---
If Killers were also included, Wraith would definitely have been in the same tier as Claudette and Tapp.
---
I still have bill at level 1 and still have all of his perks
---
Similar story with me. It eventually stopped and I acted as a final distraction while everyone else escaped
---
Anti-joke
---
is it still gonna last for two weeks or however long it was as going to last?
---
Oh my fucking god this is perfection
---
All dedicated servers really do is prevent lag switching. I can probably count on one hand how many times I’ve come across a blatant lag switcher in the past 3 years I’ve been playing
---
Dedicated servers? Where do we have those?
---
I wouldn't be against it as long as they recolored the right things and I don't think they did this time
---
Amazing my friend.
---
That or they crouch and sit there and wait until you have no time left. Why waste my time why not just leave through the exit gates so we can move on if you're a coward.
---
Awesome art!
---
10 days and yes
---
Unless you've been playing on the PTB there aren't dedicated servers yet.
---
I think that was me lol
---
And throws stalk dungpie xD
---
Go into controls and see which button does it. I dont remember off the top but it happens even if you dont touch it sometimes.
---
Not gonna lie. It’s the worst when a gen pops, and you see the killer’s aura, THEN it clicks that he’s running rancor so you end up both looking at each other and they turn back away knowing that they’re saving you for later.
---
32k x 5
---
I actually think I was the killer in that round, and that was really my thought xD
---
I did this to lol. Took a minute to figure out why lol. Got you killed didnt it?
---
I’m talking about base killer my guy. This would be a base value change and you can use PGTW on top of this, that perk is fun but not everyone wants to run gen slow down perks every match to stand a chance. This is such an insignificant change too it really won’t affect Pop.
---
Or the other side of the coin, where they yank you off while the killer is right there so you go straight back down and on the hook again while they run off.
---
32,000 x5 plus 4 stacks of WGLF or BBQ would be x6 and if its bloodhunt than it’s x7
---
32,000 x7 is 224,000 bloodpoints
---
Yeah, I run "We're Gonna Love Forever" to eat hits if I eff up lol
---
I mean once you know they have them just bait the flashlight saves
---
So cute!!
---
I was playing GF and there was an OoO with a KEY. Needless to say I tunnelled him relentlessly. After he was dead I played the game normally. One escaped.
---
Are you kidding? The majority of maps favor survivors, and the vast majority are neutral at best. Survivors can communicate in swf and killers can't. Killers have no equivalent of something like instaheals. The hatch is total horseshit and is a free escape(hatch close made it better, though). NOED, while I never use, can still be cleansed or avoided by looping. This isn't controversial; it's a very, very common opinion, one that all the best streamers pretty much share. 
---
The fact of the matter is, only a handful of killers are viable at red ranks. That's why people only play a few like Spirit or Nurse or Billy(and these still all have counters) and why I'm so happy they made the last 2(Ghostface and Demo) reasonably strong. And even then, good swf can completely destroy all but the best killers.
---
2 survivors in opening the exit i stay in the exit chase and kill one and i am a camper kid who must go to fortnitr
---
Where’s that guy who told everyone like a year ago that dedicated servers wouldn’t fix anything. I gotta find that post
---
I don't think you know what overpowered means
---
Yeah I did, I ended up trapping a slugging a lot that game cause there were at least two waiting to get the save
---
Big bro wants a hug
---
I think that on top of that maybe the survivor has to be on the damaged generator for 3 seconds to stop it or something and while those 3 seconds are happening it doesn't progress
---

bruh

The nurse is nothing but an annoyance.

They can't call the cooldown changes a fair balance when she already has a massive fucking asthma attack cooldown.

You should see how much karma I lost.XD I need help
---
Cries in totem
---
Now that I think about it... it would be really OP with OOO :/. But thank you!
---
Clown if wanna have fun, spirit if you like to win.
---
Just pick the lightborn when you see 3 flashlights
---
I'm not sure what you're implying? If you struggle with Nurse's current or the reworked CD you're just bad or haven't played her enough.
---
Well, if you only gen rush and escape without any chases or kills, no one gets shit in the way of points, and it also usually means a safety pip for every but the killer. Makes the match basically pointless.
---
Has play been in shrine recently? I dont have Myers yet but I already have a big list of killers I gotta try and level lol. Which is why I'm playing cannibal.
---
Man I thought all these 12 year olds would be in school at this time
---
I don’t man I kinda want it to be louder
---
"Survivor main" thinks it's impossible to apply pressure as a killer when literally every statistic ever released by BHVR showed killers take 4k the majority of matches. Imagine my shock.
---
It was all planned
---
Do you sell prints? I would love to hang this in my house!
---
I play against one of this guys too. So toxic people
---
I thought he realized what I was doing for him because he was standing back and letting me heal, them the dickbose just came in and got me. Ingrate!
---
It's crazy to me that they released that update like that. I mean it was obvious to literally everyone that they completely screwed up matchmaking after a few games.
---
Day 3: Still no SUCCulent plants in sight, I can feel my body getting weaker by the minute.
---
She's just watching you have Koala-ty time with the killer.
---
I actually really like this idea!
---
Those dicks ruin it for everyone. It's the same when I get three dcs and one guy staying in. I close the hatch and let him get gate points and escape.
---
Because I’m not extremely biased and I want the game to be fun for everyone ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
The private parts must be so disgusting and smelly
---
5 blinks isn’t overpowered?  oh ok
---
"Not extremely biased"
---
*proceeds to ignore every single BHVR statistic*
---
Oooh
---
That's bad mmmkay... wraiths are bad mmmmkay
---
*Boop*
---
Tbh i play the survivor with friends or when i'm too tired to play killer.Loving both sides!
---
Let's just say it, Steve's perks are shit.
---
Nah, a better comparison would be if BHVR put dedicated servers behind a $100 pay wall. Bethesda is on a whole different level man.
---
Go ahead and hit me up with that link my guy. I’ve seen them mention statistics in dev streams that say over 50% of survivors die but that’s to be expected when you take into account new players and the fact that in a balanced game at least 1 or 2 survivors should die.
---
Countering noed could easily be equivalent to throwing the game, especially if you’re solo, and the speed boost makes more of a difference than people think. And I’d say instadown addons are equivalent to instaheals, and beyond that, moris are worse. I think they can make killers stronger without making them unfun to fight, I can agree with that.
---

I never thought of that hmmm...

I still would love Samara. Although she’s a kid so it may never happen. 
---
I personally like the American version better it also scared the fuck out of me. It’s the 1 movie to actually scare me in my adulthood so how can I not love it lol.
---
Spine Chill doesn't have to do with where the killer is looking, it lights up when you're a certain distance from the killer or closer
---
Damn. How tall is she?
---
The new F76 update has been delayed to next year, and they’ve introduced a $100 subscription pass in the meantime. BHVR have delayed Withering Blight by a week at most (whatever the memes and whatnot say, we’ll definitely have it in the next week).
---
gotta get gramps added as a killer in dbd
---
THE MIDNIGHT BELL HAS TOLLED
---
I’ve thought about this exact thing before
---
If i just don't have the entity upset with me I call that a win
---
when i say toxic swf mean toxic swf i think xd not all swf
---
It's not that I'm assuming it doesnt stack, it's that the perk description literally says you cannot stack healing bonuses past 100%. I recognize I am wrong though, and just hope they change the description to be more clear.
---
Día de muertos event incoming
---
This really is a fantastic idea. And I have to feel it would also help put an end to 1 player DC'ing so the last person gets hatch.
---
When you know where it is but just enjoy riding on daddys shoulder.

WAZUUUUUUUP

I know it’s just it goes both ways, and I was bored

1 day for an event?
---
Unless you are on an indoor map, you are near guaranteed to spawn in sightline of a box.
---
Some people on this sub think that 1 bps = doubles your bloodpoints, so 2bps = quadruples your bloodpoints, 3bps = 8x, etc 
---
Same applies to bloodhunt events. It doesn’t multiply any of the bonuses. It’s just as if there was an additional BPS in every game
---
 Thanks for my listening to my red talk
---
On a scale of one to ten how said are you?
---
Ngl plague is lookin pretty crisp right now... I’d smash
---
She's easier to play nurse.
---
Super good idea actually, hex Ruin is one of the perks that is in dire need of a rework
---
So, if we use streamers than does it give us bonus? I can has point?
---
Sprint burst isn't that good compared to dead hard and balanced landing
---
I don't need the 4k to feel like I won but survivors def. do as they are quick to point out with GGEZ, trash killer, etc., if I don't 4k.
---
Good!!!
---
You?
---
I've played since 2016 ik all these basic tips but she can hear breathing and footsteps. She can also see grass, corn, and reeds moving.
---
Thank you for having the time to honor my beloved Ruahperson
---
Still, Behaviour is absolutely stuffing this game with multiple free-to-play monetization methods in a game that's not free-to-play. Lesser degree, but still roughly the same practice as 76.
---
Hey man, Jane mains are legit.
---
Wow she looks disgusting. Awesome work man
---
Survival points annoy me so much. You should get points for every gen that is completed while you are alive, every survivor you outlast, and for escaping.
---
PC has been using servers for the Live Branch for the past 2 weeks. And it's made Dead Hard start popping after you get hit a shitload more than P2P ever thought about doing.
---
#HNGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
---
^doot ^doot
---
I'd buy you dbd emotes
---
She is fun to play tbh, she get to mindgame basically everything and zoom around the map. The fact shes so unfun to play against is what stops me playing her.
---
Yup, one of the options is strictly for this kind of language
---
i know but i am a killer main so i find more toxic swfs more than toxic killer
---
Sprint burst allows you to work on generators in unsafe areas without worry.
---
Is it that hard to remember who you had hooked? If you arent camping or tunneling you shouldnt ever deal with DS unless you have absurd amounts of pressure so it doesnt matter anyway
---
I play both sides and find more toxic swfs so I see where you’re coming from
---
Mori isn't exactly common now because it's impossible to pip up with it. Instaheals you see literally every single or second game in red ranks. You can undo several minutes or even a minute of work in 1 second, which is game-changing. 
---
Hatch is busted because it encourages hiding and drags the game out unnecessarily. Hatch could easily be replaced with something where you have the killer chase you for X amount of time. Far more balanced.
---
Yeah, that's what I said. Loop NOED. 
---
You can juke the Nurse if you're familiar with her. But a good Nurse can't really be juked, which is why it is reasonable to say she needed a little Nerf. 
---
Dude, I've been rank 1 forever, and I 3 or 4k the majority of time at red ranks. I'm pretty familiar with the game, and my survivor gameplay has recently improved a lot. I'm quite experienced, which is why(in my opinion) I'm able to look at it from both sides, and recognize that one side has a larger theoretical advantage, especially where maps are concerned. That's the survs. 
---
Lol, TydeTyme sucks,, but tru3, even if you dislike him, is really good at both roles compared to the average DbD player. I've heard Zubat say this too, who is very good and well respected. Noob3 has alluded to this, who is a very good surv but an average or slightly above average killer. 
---
I mean, the core problem is that survivors start with an advantage coming into the match. Most maps favor them. Okay. They have 4 people, and it takes 1 good looper to preoccupy a killer for several minutes. Then you add instaheals(which are more common than any crazy killer add-on like beads or Iri Head), gen rushing, communication in swf, swf itself, and the fact that over half the killers have powers that make them no good versus coordinated teams(Wraith, Legion, Bubba, Trapper, Pig, etc, we all know by now) and survivors, from a standpoint of pros vs cons, have the advantage.
---
I had the exact same experience a few weeks ago. The dude's reasoning for camping hatch was that he got into 2nd stage. Bitch please, go cry me a river. It didn't even matter because he didnt get hooked after that. Nothing was stopping him from doing the last gen.
---
Alert will not work when the killer is stealthed post-update though. Not gonna argue which perk is better.
---
wholesome umanity💖
---
I find her fun :/
---
In a perfect world all the killers would be around Michael or spirits tier. That’s what I’m hoping for one day. It would make the game fun and interesting for everyone.
---
I'm just out here waiting for shirtless legion :(
---
Based on an unfortunately true story. Not really a meme but just sorta venting.
---
Solo queue is fun.
---
thanks for understand and very good name xd
---
1 on 1 a survivor stands no chance against a killer, a survivor can waste a lot of time looping but this is all it does, a killer can zone out a survivor and bloodlust them down with little effort.
---
I hope I don't just speak for myself here, but when you've played characters like Legion, Clown, Pig etc at red ranks, it gets tiring that there are games you will simply lose as soon as you're in the lobby due to what the survivors bring into the trial. This includes voice comms.
---
She's one of two Killers that can deal with all of it. She also happens to be the easier of the those two Killers. So it's a no brainer (for me) to play her as every game I'll have a chance and will not instantly be shit on.
---
I've been R1 with Huntress, Pig, Legion, Billy, Nurse and Spirit (Hit it this reset). So yes I know, it's possible to get there without playing her or Nurse, but there are games that are instantly lost upon the lobby screen, and that's never, ever fair.
---
Since the front page of this subreddit is filled with, interesting memes, I thought I'd use this sticky to address the fact that myself and multiple others have noticed some cosmetic items are missing (specifically Trappers Ornate Mask)
---
She is there cuz of technician.
---
What if Legion was a mask that possessed people instead of just being a group of troubled youth? That way you could choose any survivor you have to be the killer, just add a mask to them.
---
I just watched Scream for the first time a couple of days ago (I’m a little late, I know), but Ghost Face is just a literal rapist
---
Turbulence is a timeless masterpiece
---
Jeff can finally be the real killer of darkness among us
---
But can you teabag with We’ll Make it? 
---
Nyet.
---
Myers isnt anywhere nears spirits level. 
---
Also Spirit is still weaker than nurse imo, but i dont mind playing against nurse as much as you can at least see her and respond accordingly, spirit is just guessing while your healthy and then just die when your injured without iron will.
---
People don’t “leave during the loading screen”. They crash or don’t load in. There’s not even the option to unless you task manager it.
---
This is wholesome but at the same time doing the objective of the killer isn’t toxic
---
People complain about Spirit.What should we do?Make every killer like Spirit.Brilliant idea.
---
So if you do offering killer and it bugs so you play your killer then keep it and you decide to keep it, it falls under exploitation of the game
---
Fallout 76 is direct pay2win at this point. DBD is nowhere near that point- a point could be made for BBQ and Chili, but not only does the shrine exist (and it’s been in at least twice this year), but BBQ isn’t a direct ‘you’ve got this, now you’re at a definite advantage to everyone else’. Yeah, it’s a very good perk, but it’s not a Ruin situation where it’s like ‘yeah, you NEED this’. 
---
Yeah, DBD has the in-game store where you can buy cosmetics. But DBD is nowhere near F76.
---
I think the third perk is not a good perk, it is a endgame perk and with other endgame perks like bloodwarden they are situational yet game changing. That is what I feel endgame perk should be like. And window block in endgame is really useless, it does not do anything in the start and when the gens are powered they just block windows for a most 30 seconds. How about making it change to windows being block until the endgame collapse starts? This forces the player to open the gate and the timer puts them in a disadvantage.
---
Yeah I know it's cancer
---
Weird cause whenever I go in a game and I’m the only one that brings a escape cake or bloodpoint offering every survivor gets a boost
---
Ima buy Cannibal. Not that I intentionally broke the game, but its still worth mentioning.
---
Yes I know Myers is under billy but Myers is still played so people can’t just go screaming nerf all killers. That’s why I said that. 
---
Michael is good by himself but with a good player behind him he excels and that’s why I said michale Tier. He’s right under the top 3. 
---
Yes Spirit is weaker then nurse obviously but no one wants to play against nurse like killers. 
---
Nurse is a killer that tosses the basic rules of dbd out the window. 
---
Again thats why I said in those ranks in general. I know what I’m saying mate.
---
Hmm, weird. Most of my killer games end with ggs and gls whether I 4K, 3K, or get less than a 3K. Sure there's a jerk survivor once in awhile, but its no different than killers who go into games to face camp because they want to collect salty steam comments. Probably the same people tbh.
---
Reminds me of [Labell_xx whe they draw baby huntress](https://twitter.com/Labell_xx/status/1187320733170450433?s=19)
---
OK but sprint burst is still a very good perk.
---
High quality
---
If your worried about DS yeah let them be slugged for a minute, or better yet man up and grab the survivor and down them again.
---
When you loop the killer so hard you start getting docked BP because you are too good at the game
---
I dont play on PC so that explains why I had no clue. So it's not even helping I see.
---
We need dedicated servers on PS4. The development of this game will never cease to amaze me. Damn near 4 years in. Theyve had cosmetics in the game for long enough to be able to have a playable game on consoles.
---
I know your intentions are pure but ive seen this case before
---
My best advice is just buy Cannibal now to avoid any trouble I dont work for BHVR but ive seen people get in trouble
---
Level Head would be absolutely busted at high ranks where survivors are actually consistently hitting great skillchecks. That effect needs to be removed.
---
Because??
---
People complain because 1. They don’t know how to deals with her and mostly her power is what’s the problem. Even making killers around her tier doesn’t mean they will be as good. 
---
You know what I’m just not going to argue with a simpleton like yourself.
---
Now that you mention it lol
---
Fair play
---
I'll be honest this isnt a awful idea. The joker by himself isnt a good idea. But this guy who went and slaughtered entire worlds legitimately would scare me.
---
Thx for letting me know man.
---
I wish those were the types of survivors I ran into. I can almost guarantee my first killer game of the day I'm getting a salty message. It never fails.
---
And you still got em all, well done! Got what they deserved.
---
Totally get it, I'm hoping people take this further and take it upon themselves to play the game fairly knowing there's another person with human emotions on the other end. If we play fair, this game is 100% perfect.
---
No worries your all good ^^
---
😏
---
i trust big dick mexican
---
Then don’t feed into the business model. The only content that affects actual gameplay that you are required to purchase with real money is licensed killers like Freddy/Michael/ghost face/etc. Even then, that’s because they are required by law and agreement to pay the license holders a share of the earnings they make off of licensed DLC.
---
There is literally nothing else in the game that affects in game gameplay that is required to be purchased with real money. Everything apart from the licensed killers that needs to be bought with auric cells is purely cosmetic based. 
---
If Myers or Demogorgon or some licensed killer was the best killer in the game, then you could argue it’s pay to win, but the top two are original killers, and the very best killer comes with the base game.
---
If you think they’re greedy then vote with your wallet, but most people here are dedicated players who are more than happy to have new content in whatever form it may come. Not everyone is gonna buy every skin, but occasionally they do release something that I think is worth my money given how much I play.
---
It's either in the pantry basement or off in the literal corner of the map. I've never seen it spawn ANYWHERE else.
---
Remember when everyone was saying that all perks were good and balanced when stranger things was announced
---
Would love to see him in the game But i doubt that Behavior will get the license.
---
Where is autodidact
---
I’m not great, but playing her helps me track scratch marks better, not just focusing on seeing the survivor themselves.
---
Hatch can often be a free escape for survivors who did nothing all game. Ever heard of the meme about the immersed claudette always waiting for hatch?
---
NoED is bad. It does nothing all game until the very end, where survivors are at their strongest (barring the beginning of the game). BT, DS, and other second chance perks become stupid strong, because the killer won't catch you before you can get to the exits. It doesn't even activate half the time with so many people running Inner Strength. 
---
What streamers? Try literally all the ones who have ever played killer at a high level.
---
A big problem right now is killers always lose their add-ons, while survivors can escape with their items. This makes killers expensive to keep them viable at a high level, while survivors can just open chests, or escape with their current items. Wraith can be viable at rank 1 if you are running his best add-ons and are really good at him, but unless you are constantly feeding points into him, he drops off.
---
Hard agree too. Pebbleboy is a joke
---
£60 for content the content of a 4 year old game yeah, but you’ve omitted the fact that those £60 are worth the 4 years of content that have come out during said time period.
---
It’s not like they stopped updating the game in 2017 but every DLC was made £20

**Legality of bestiality in the United States**
---
Legality of bestiality in the  States looks at the laws prohibiting bestiality in the United States of America. The legality of sex with animals has been steadily decreasing over the past 20 years. As of February 10, 2018, 45 states and 2 territories ban sex with animals, while 5 states and the District of Columbia have decriminalized it (due to repeal of sodomy laws). In 2017, five states (Texas, Kentucky, West Virginia, Vermont and Nevada) introduced legislation to ban bestiality, with Nevada, Vermont, and Texas enacting laws banning it in 2017.

I think this description fits better for baby survivors who get obliterated
---
No clue if you have all dlc or not, but saw chapter and ash are on sale currently, so I nabbed ash alongside leather. 😉
---
For me, I have played every killer, and I seem to do best with her. She is the only killer I can play without any perks or add-ons (I have none, I'm a survivor main) and manage to get a 4K every match. I really like her power.....phase walking is fun.
---
I was speaking on the basis of both perks individually, not together, since they’re basically the same with one having a slight drawback with a fuckton of reward
---
I now want a killer named give up with noed, spirit fury, nurses calling, and Bbq and chilly
---
That's incorrect, "Get notified when the Killer is looking directly in your direction and standing within a range of **36 metres**."
---
Many other killers can lose the game from the loadout screen due to any number of factors. Imagine queuing up as Hag and seeing everyone switch to flashlights at the last second (happened to me last night). I love Ghostface but I had at least one survivor run OoO in 2 of the 3 games I played with him last night. Much of the killer roster lacks the mobility to consistently deal with efficient survivors. Spirit is one of the few limited options average red rank killers (not 5k hr streamers) have against good SWF.
---
Damn I can only imagine what Michael Meyers would look like in your style! Hell even all the killers itd be a wicked display
---
As far as purchasing underpowered or broken content goes, personally I really don’t think it’s too hard to do some research before you buy something. 
---
If $5 really is so much to you that it’s all the change you can spare for the game, then I know I’d be watching vids on every killer to try and figure out which one is the most fun and usable.
---
Personally, 5$ really isn’t that much to me, and I enjoy playing all the killers regardless of how strong they are, so I have no gripes with Ghostface’s buggyness or clowns underpoweredness. Not to say I wouldn’t like to see some of the worse or more buggy killers get some love, but it’s not cuz I feel cheated out of my money
---
I assume the Halloween "event" will last as long as the first Rift (IE 3 months) since it's tied to the Rift which is a little weird but whatever.
---
As for when it's released some of the Fog Whisperers have said that it should take BHVR around a week to fix but since they usually update on Tuesday I expect the event to come out on the 29th.  
---
Meaning that we'd have a **2** day event.
---
It's made a lot of weird lag for me that before only existed with players from another country with 200+ ping. At the lobby screen now the ping shows me at around 40-60 depending, but it feels like a 250+ ping match against a McDonald's WiFi killer - even when I'm the killer now. I've even gone through my network hardware and settings with a network admin I know to verify it's not my fiber connection or PC - everything looks good on my end.
---
Damn never watched any chuckie movies... is he really like that? I believe the devs will put him in the game soon. 
---
A german interviewer asked cote about chucky and cote even talked about how funny it would be to see his camera Perspective would be and how he would jump around a lot. He talked about it like he had seen it before

Glad you saw the movies, which have absolutely NO connection with Danny Johnson 'Jed Olsen' (DBD's Ghost Face). Read his lore on wiki or at least in game (same info).

Awww thats so cute

What if it's a Legion?
---
It tastes good
---
Point at it and laugh.
---
What if it's Nurse?

They are fixing it, more info on the forums.

Never thought id want an escape cake as much as i do now :)
---
You wouldn’t even get close enough to boop.
---
Lol fucking congrats mate! For a second I thought you where idubbz you kind of look like him at least to me lol.
---
I do this sometimes. For instance when someone gets hooked, and there's a regressing generator close to you thats over 80% done, I touch/work it for a few moments if I was close to you when the hooktimer started, if I came hauling ass crossmap and you're about to reach second stage I'll just touch it to stop regression and unhook. Depends on the situation I guess
---
D strike was a bit overpowered before, but now it’s exactly what is needed to deal with dick head tunnelers who can’t get kills any other way

I feel like the Chestburster idea, while interesting, would be a bit OP. Even if it takes 2 minutes to activate, a good endgame/time-wasting playstyle can make any Chestburster survivor unable to survive, as most games tend to last more than 5 minutes. Essentially, if within the first couple minutes your Face-Huggered, your screwed. I would think of doing something like a liquid the survivors take time to drink to prevent the Chestburster from spawning, like an acid or something. It harms them, putting them in the Broken status effect for maybe 1 minute and 30 secs, but prevents the Chestburster from killing them.
---
Now that's a pro gamer move
---
It is understandable. I only ever watched one stream and I think it was the one about freddys rework. The comments were pure cringe.
---
I would question why is this a thing? And why do they not activate. You could also just make it to where meta perks just don’t show up or only green perks do etc. 
---
If they made that change or the game like that I’d ask them that lol.
---
what was the killers rank?
---
Eat the fucking ds ffs
---
i mean I would blame the killer not the survivors for that.
---
I've noticed lag in a lot of my matches too recently but I'm on console with p2p. Everything else seems to work fine but matches as killer and against killer just seem to lag a lot more.
---
Plague was always the hottest thing in the room you god damn heathen rrrriya
---
Doot Doot!
---
Yeah you can still buy non-licensed killers with shards, but the amount of time required to get them is a bit unreasonable. It takes roughly 30 or so hours of play time to get enough shards to buy a Killer then factor in the BP you have to spend to level them up, unlock the perk, then unlock it on the Killers you want.. Remember how absolutely pissed off people got when they heard it took roughly [40 hours to unlock Luke Skywalker in Star Wars Battlefront 2](https://kotaku.com/players-are-trying-to-calculate-how-long-it-takes-to-un-1820373111)? Why shouldn't we be equally pissed off that we're being expected to buy DLC with pay-to-win mechanics or face long, unreasonable times to unlock them for free? Especially when you consider that Behaviour has injected DbD with far more than just one monetization method. I will bet that by the end of 2020, Behaviour will either have already released or announced a loot box system in addition to other free-to-play mechanics.
---
Additionally, it should probably be capped at level 1, meaning if you have it at a higher level it reverts to level 1. Also what about killers? And the permanent thing seems too restrictive, maybe allow it’s change at least once a month or once a season, or just remove that clause entirely.
---
Nice concept but should be match with a Black Mirror Killer too.
---
This is cute, i like it. Good work!
---
Thank god you read the post and got the idea

---
Fair point about Pgtw, although at that point in time it shouldn't be that important.
---
Also you don't waste time, you save time by not having to carry them to the hook and play the hooking animation. Also gives more BP and most likely the same amount of devout points.
---
Depends on usage. If they hold it the entire match it sucks. If they run around normally and have it used when the killer comes at them on a gen, it’s good.
---
DH and BL are far superior for being chased all game.
---
Lol but to answer you in all seriousness small game.
---
Really really easy games.
---
Ok, every player lock one survivor and one killer perk, If a killer go to a match and there's 2 survivors that lock that same perk, the killer lose the fifth perk + one randon.
---
fun is subjective, and I find her fun. winning is nice too.
---
considering only killers can have their own perks at any trial, why the restriction for survivors to be fucked over TWO perks, considering that’s all survivors get to have in order to differentiate themselves and their playstyle other than just being skin swaps..
---
but anyway, hope, small game or resilience.
---
Go to your bindings if ur on pc and change the invert control to a key you don't press. Same with console
---
I’m not sure! The other two are definitely a bit more different than this one and more on the “lewd” side, so I may not lol
---
Absolute horseshit. Protecting gens is one of your only ways to keep the game together in your favor. You just found some shitty buttheads who felt like being rude, that's all :) They were likely just salty 'cause they couldn't get their act together and figure out how to do gens ;) Keep it up, friend!
---
If you're into rotting flesh that is 😉😅
---
Vommy Mommy looking amazing
---
Every time I try to take a sip of water.
---
6 ft, the rest are just 5'11''.
---
I always hit that dumb button when I'm struggling like a maniac
---
Looking for EU PS4 SWF group. Preferably with mics, and red ranks
---
It kinda has to be, since the game is run by a survivor main studio.
---
If you finish an almost complete generator nearby before going for the unhook, the killer won’t suspect anyone went over to save them and won’t bother checking that gen either.
---
I'd take small game, kindred or plunderers, but those would probably be used a lot.
---
So maybe left behind, the amount of times my team just facetanks the killer and i'm the last one left is more than i would like.
---
Not yet! I’m really hoping to get prints ready by the end of the year
---
Thank you :’) and Photoshop is what I use!
---
Ty! yeah, I do  [https://www.deviantart.com/elisyna](https://www.deviantart.com/elisyna)
---
god no, i play on pc
---
nope
---
Technician or alert from Feng they're both good perks and underated imo
---
Funny you should say this, because right before we all got out he disconnected.
---
They didn't achieve victory.  They still lost they just didn't die.  Anytime you force a hatch escape with gens up you won as killer.  It's more like a consolation prize for having a shit team and even then it is still in killers favor since they're faster and can close it permanently.
---
3 guys already said small game, that would be a bad idea indeed
---
Maybe hug the Myers? I'm sure he could use a hug, he gets beat up a lot.
---
You're awfully generous comparing this hack to Van Gogh, besides you can't separe his art from his ideology since he injects it on every comic he makes.
---
I don't know whether to be enraged or excited! I feel both! And it's wonderful! What a great play, excellent job :)
---
I read the webpage they made and the ceo declared that he despised crunch time and would avoid it no matter what. 
---
Im sure that has something to do with events being delayed and that, I think that is the reason why many AAA companies are always giving updates sonce they usually do crunch times.
---
I respect behaviour for not forcing their employees into this kind of things
---
escape cake is for survivors, survivor pudding is for killer, and Bloody Part Streamers is for everyone
---
Have you considered getting a new friend? 
---
Yours seem to have a defect. You might ask for a refund too.
---
This is solo que in a nutshell
---
She is easy, the 2nd best killer in the game, and carries what should be low rank killers to red ranks.
---
Wake Up is indeed a strong perk that would be nice to "just have"
---
You are right about the chinese new year but the 3year was just a bloodpoint event with party starters
---
7/10 not enough side boob -ign
---
Jk looks fking great
---
On ptb it triggered pgtw but didn't trigger overcharge
---
You lucky son of a gun.  I'd kill to face Leatherfaces again.  I almost never see that man anymore.  Love running that man especially if they like attempting their saws at loops.
---
Ah thank you dude hahah
---
Could you imagine being in love with a rando? Gross.
---
I've heard both answers u mentioned. I would probably go with nerfed. Since they said you could stack it with resilience which was way too much. That's the answer I got. 
---
This question lacks awareness. no one really knows.
---
Finally, I'll be able to play against 60fps killers on my 30fps switch.
---
Maybe hope?
---
Holy god this iS INSANE YOU'RE SO GOOD
---
Probably slippery meat
---
My 1 problem with this is that it's a hag teachable perk, and she was the inventor of the hex perks basically. Taking that away is like making a Michael perk non obsession based, ya feel me?
---
Hope is indeed a good choise, and no one said it yet, so it's good to go
---
Clearly it’s infatuation and not love if you just met.
---
The thought has crossed my mind for sure! Unfortunately I think the warranty ran out after 90 days. Haha but in all seriousness they are good people, just outside of dbd. I think for now I'll just stop playing with them and maybe find another activity we can do together, like coloring or macrame.
---
one of the best killer perks easy
---
Would it be an issue though?
---
Some PC players already use controllers and the survivor experience isn't much different from PC to console.
---
The only issue is that red rank console survivors will have to go against good killers that have no limitations.
---
Not really. Despite people bitching about the end game trap changes, end game piggy was always gimmicky at best. The point of the traps isn’t to prevent escapes once the gens are done, they’re meant to slow the game down. End game Piggy wasn’t even that good. Pig has her problems but this sub is a little dramatic acting like she went from god tier to shit tier because of trap changes
---
Ah, that i didn't read from the post.
---
Well that's sad for swf then because it would effectively stop you from playing with your friends if they happened to have the same 5th perk then.
---
Then i choose a perk no one ever uses. Buckle up.
---
Missing how?
---
Maybe make that there's a hex totem, while this hex is active, it Will grant a new token every 45 seconds, so if the hex is destroyed, the perk still works, but it will come to a end later
---
I hadn’t considered using puke to avoid hitting when it came to perks that require not hitting a certain person
---
Lightweight. Nobody uses that. I like to run freely. Even watching my teammates walk annoys me.
---
I really want to play more plague now lol. Good job!
---
Use MoM like a god
---
Thank you so much, you kind soul
---
Newbie here , what does Proc mean?
---
it only triggers surveillance since all other perks say "while kicking a gen and surveillance says regressing gens"
---
Lightweight almost have no impact, but as a fifth perk would be really strong tho
---
Yeah true.  That's why that studio spent the past year nerfing/balancing various survivor mechanics all over the place.  You people making claims like this are clowns.
---
Even if you buy everything at full price, The game is still less then Fallout First and you get a ton more than the membership.
---
Also, while DBD is held together by hope and wishful thinking, at least stuff *works* in it.
---
Nothing in Fallout First works as intended, the scrap box deletes whatever you put in it for God's sake.
---
And buy a ps5 since that optimization patch is never coming
---
Hahahahahahah
---
Mom can we have deliverance?
---
We have deliverance at home.
---
Deliverance at home: Slippery meat
---
Looks so good I would have thought it was official
---
Howdy, I'm a red rank Xbox killer (GT: Unliteracy) on the EST timezone. I'm interested in doing causal KYF matches where we all talk in a party together. I just want to be able to play some killer matches where I kinda hear what the survivors think about the match in real time, and we can discuss perks and strategies along the way.
---
Let me know if that sounds interesting to you! I'd prefer to play against a group of 4 friends who know each other for the sake of simplicity and "scheduling." That said, you can add me if you're interested in casual matches, or if you even just wanna talk about tactics/perks and whatnot.
---
It's probably good against spirits. TbH sometimes it helps me, and sometimes I feel like it works against me with some killers.
---
To be fair he did kill 3 of her friends
---
Pig isn't that bad, honestly.
---
Because it fucks the killer and depending on how many do it the killer will even lose a pip but also some other people just leave because they know the games over for them and there is no concede option so they just DC
---
Yeah I feel like this idea had only the top survivors in mind rather than the average player.  Giving the killer sight of the last survivor that frequently is incredibly OP especially with high mobility killers And what about killers that don’t give a shit about looping like nurse, spirit, huntress, Freddy and doctor? As someone mentioned below if you’re injured you’re at a huge disadvantage. Yeah I feel like he needs to go back to the drawing board on this one.
---
I was playing my shithead Nurse build on console last night (NOED/Insidious/Rancor/BBQ&amp;Chili) and hid in the exit gates until poor Nancy came to open my door. She was also the obsession. Hey but at least I got my daily done for the Nurse mori
---
Because they’re toxic people dc because they get knocked down and are going to get hooked. I had a game where a SWF played a Shroud to all spawn close, then immediately DC’d when someone failed a ruin check. 
---
People ares assholes.
---
i do that when against nurse, do gens beside the hooked survivor, just because the timer you have on hook is still long progress and i didnt hearing nurse blink yet. so to avoid he instantly back blink, i do gens beside him to wait the blink. but the hooked guy just doing kobe so i rush help him. guess what? nurse back
---
It’s to not let the other one get points for the action you get points for putting people on hook if they quit while you carry them to hook you’ve just wasted more time for noting
---
This statement is correct
---
&gt;!but I dont like it!&lt;
---
Ummm I mean that's just your opinion ;)
---
Yeah, lightweight need a small buff, would be nice If it was like: when you scape a chase, for 5 seconds your scratchmarks are missleading (point to randon directions)
---
Lol full game guaranteed Ruin?  Thank god the devs don't balance the game down to your level.
---
Where's the perk to make the rank 20 stop sprinting across the map like they are in a track and field match? &gt;.&gt;
---
This looks great!
---
Hell, I'd respect it. If a survivor is willing and able to run up and deck a monstrous demon from another dimension in what passes for a face, they deserve to leave.
---
Lol. 
---
I heard someone say if perks had a 4th tier level that footsteps would not make noise. Like walking on grass.
---
What do you think your proposal is?  This would be balancing the game around a noob killer.  Your proposal is absurd.  You'd see that if you weren't potato.
---
Good, all snoots deserve to be booped!
---
I wasnt taking them seriously lol, but thanks anyway
---
I don’t even care if I die on pale rose. The only objective is to blast the foghorn gen.
---
They added it back but it feels like it’s not like before
---
True, the fatigue recover running alongside token recovery really doesn't change her all that much.
---
No problem
---
SAME
---
Cause its not what I actually meant? Stealth and immersed are two diffetent things, but if the stealth player is being useful its ok, you people need to think twice before talking, as I should have before writing the wrong thing, it wasn't really meant to "fool" anyone
---
Joe Mama
---
I'll definitely tell you if I ever decide to \^\^
---
Really, comparing BHVR to *Bethesda*? Do you know nothing about either company?
---
No, but during certain times a day it can be. On my break I got paired with a bunch of rank 16-20’s. I ether got safety pip or lost a pip because we got nothing done on each game. The last game the killer only hooked a person twice. Not much to do to pip up since the gens got done so quickly. 
---
Once you get paired with higher people who know how to loop or save, you have more ability to pip up. At lower ranks you are more at the mercy of those around you. Loop the killer for 3 minutes, 1 gen gets done, die on first hook or farmed/tunneled off the hook without borrowed time.
---
This was me playing killer the first time.
---
I always try to solo gens just incase of discordance and stuff like this
---
My bad, it was really stupid to write that. Just forget I ever wrote something
---
That is weird because the only thing that gives everyone a boost are the green offerings of party streamers and the bound envelope.
---
Bamboozle legion is the best legion
---
She was always bad tho
---
Country girls make do

Well said
---
Fuck me I never even seen it and that was  after reading his name 😂
---
I was going to leave all your asses the second I had the cosmetics I wanted from the event and had the achievements I had decided to get this time around.
---
I love this game but I also hate it, I love a lot of you guys but I also hate the guts of a lot of you.
---
This game is a bad romance.
---
wow I didn't know that and I usually use it. It seems like it's always on when the killer's near me.
---
I'm gonna send you a happy birthday every day of November til I get it right.
---
Hey guess what?
---
NOBODY CARES
---
just eat the DS. 60s turn into 5s. easy right?
---
"You don't have to buy it, but it's practically free! Spend your money for free stuff!"
---
I mean, the fact that you can't quite grasp how ironic your overall statement has been so far is hilarious, but okay, shill, lol.
---
Wait, why is my sweet kate into animals?
---
Fuck off toxic cunt.  If you hate the game, the devs, and the community so much then simply fucking bounce man.  Why stick around?  To be toxic and annoying af on the sub?  Absolutely not a soul will miss you I promise that shit.
---
I dont even get nea
---
Gun: You have a pistol/submachine gun/.50 cal sniper rifle. Every time the killer sees you, get one token. Each token is a bullet. Aim the gun like a flashlight; if you shoot the killer, they die and you win.
---
"How's this for unforeseen consequences?!" -Cote
---
It's annoying BUT the BUFF IS COMING! FEAR NOT FELLOW GHOSTIE MAIN!
---
I solo que survivor because none of my friends play the game. Boy oh boy do I get some interesting teams. From the “can’t hit a skill check” to the “run straight into the killer, get downed and dc” kind of teams
---
It happened during my first game on stream today, if you're interested in the vod:  [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/499451612](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/499451612)

She just LOOKS like the kind of person who would be into that stuff.

Don’t be afraid to make even a small bit of money selling stickers now. It can help make it at easier later if you have a couple of bucks. People are trying to throw money at you.

You should be able to just upload your designs and get commission on anything sold (Even shirts or cups) without having to worry about inventory or logistics or shipping. 
---
Look it up and give it a shot if you think it makes sense.
---
These puns are unbearable.
---
Is there a specific appeareance of a animal fucker?
---
Spine chill still will. in fact it will now work against tier 1 myers, so it gets a small buff.
---
Someone who looks like they’d fuck animals.
---
Resilience or hope, small boosts that can help a lot.
---
the idea would be incredibly flawed though, because what about new players? do they just have to pick a teachable? if they can pick any can they pick other teachables that they don't even have access to? what if they later want to use a teachable that they didn't have access to?
---
Permanence like that doesn't belong in a game like this, fun idea, but very flawed
---
For the killer perk: NOED, BBQ or the one that shows when 2 or more survivors are working on a gen, because I hate all 3
---
Some people take the role of survivor as the good guy and killer as the bad guy so they feel entitled. If you play both roles, you understand the game much better and can appreciate the work that goes into playing each role fairly and as intended. Being a good killer is an often thankless and soul eating experience. I bet if they play as killer and really put in effort i.e. no NOED and no camping, hard tunneling, they might appreciate the role more, especially at high ranks.
---
May you specify what characteristics?
---
To me she sounds fun
---
Go invisible to move faster, but suffer leaving your body behind as a warning to survivors and you cannot see the survivors! However, you can follow scratchmarks!
---
*laughs in giving so little of a shit about others that will just wait 60 seconds as their team hides in bushes nearby waiting to flash me which won’t happen because I’m waiting out DS.*
---
Quick little tweaks
---
Name change- significant other, since, you know, girl survivors too :)
---
Now with the tiny exhaustion perk, it's got a shorter timer, so add a small sprint burst, like you go 50% faster for 3 seconds.
---
Pretty much, only time I’ll say it’s late if it comes after Halloween lol.
---
4 clone neas
---
Every game has a 5th Claudette survivor, most people never notice her.
---
Eh, maybe in the future. I really like this concept but I kinda want an original killer this time. Still a great idea nonetheless and I think with a few changes here and there it would be pretty cool.
---
Need to be so loud it downs every survivor. 👍
---
Hmmmmnnmmm weird
---
Wow you did a nice job!
---
I could see it being something they might focus on sometime next year as this year they wanted to do dedicated servers and the Switch.
---
Nurse build NOED/Insidious/Agitation/Blood Warden. Then teleport into an exit gate and just wait.
---
Then the claudette next to you d/c's
---
The tie and shirt look like a very surprised creeper
---
buff of what?
---
Bunny Mom is best mom.
---
I’ll be on the look out!
---
Its because once you play with mics with other people you realize how easy it becomes to play the game.

i think depends on the person in my case if that happend i die very quick but as a killed you can't die and you have to try catch people who play better than you make tbag spam flashlight etc and in the end start trash talking 
---
btw in mostly cases i like when the killer chases me im trash with survivor but it's fun for me running away or trying running away that's why i say depends on the person
---
There is a game In this bug
---
yea, hatch is need when 3 gens done + 1 survivor dead to spawn. or the only last survivor
---
-Beanie hat.
---
-Green tank top.
---
-Goblin-like facial structure.
---
-Swedish.
---
Dude, is it really worth ruining the game for 4 other players?
---
I dont get the pulling cable part?
---
I played 3 games as demogorgon yesterday, where I had hidden portals in the corner of the map.
---
After a hook, I would teleport to the corner, wait for the unhook, then return to normal, albeit very fair play, chasing and pallet breaking.
---
All 3 games ended with me getting 2 hooks, and teabagged at the gate by full 4 man SWF squads at about rank 6.
---
They all berated me to no end.
---
Next, I played as clown, and I just went ham on the squad of 4 solo rank 15s.
---
All of them were mad that I 3 hooked everyone and they got no gens done.
---
This is very offensive
---
Lmao, Nea is Shrek
---
3K already big win for me. 2K i feel already feel win ( even its draw ). 4k? i dont really look it that much when i play as killer. mostly i give last survivor hatch if that survivor its goodplay. post chat? i dont care about that lmao
---
I completely agree with you, they won't play killer so they don't understand the frustrations that come along with it. They only play killer for the dailies and they just farm the whole time. I'm a survivor main but I've put some hours into killer and definitely feel for them when it comes to toxic survivors. That is one of the reasons I don't play killer more, because I get more frustrated as killer than as a survivor. But there's two sides of a coin and survivors aren't all to blame. It's good to at least appreciate when a player plays a good game, on both sides. We're all just people trying to have fun in a video game.
---
I’m just giving facts.
---
If you survive the points should be on par with the killer. 
---
19k points for surviving is appalling.
---
That could be said of most hex perks, but the fact is if a hex perk is not active and at full power right from the beginning of the match, you won't get much use out of it.
---
Devour is the obvious exception but that perk remains hidden until it gets really dangerous and it gives you one of the best effects in the game, but due to totem spawns it's still a gamble to use it.
---
Whilst on my Myers it’s 30k min
---
Imagine fucking 4 other people over in a game because you're a spiteful piece of garbage. You're punishing people whose fault it isn't when you should be directing your frustrations at the devs. Why don't you just uninstall the game and do everyone a favor if you don't enjoy it? Also, incase you're unaware, despite what you may think it is still 1v4, so it stands to reason the person with the more difficult job gains more rewards. That doesn't mean they couldn't simply increase killer rewards while also increasing survivor rewards, but whatever.
---
Alternatively, you could try looking up a guide "How to loop" so you don't die every game and have to DC. In other words, git gud :)
---
Decisive is a fair perk
---
I clicked on the post because all it says is swf so I had to see what it said dumbass
---
I'm not going to DC because I want what pathetic BP I get on surv, but I 100% get this and wish you and anyone else that wants to pull the survivor strike the best of luck.
---
You will no longer be able to see the aura of stealth killers when they’re in their stealth modes. Pig crouch, Ghostface night shroud, etc. So you wont be able to see them with things like object of obsession.
---
If there's 2 gens to go, and the SWF group has been speeding through them like a hot butcher knife through butter, you better believe I'll target the guy on death hook. otherwise, I get a bunch of Neas teabagging at the open gates because they planned for Borrowed Time and Decisive to be active. 
---
Funny how playing by the survivors' "rules" is equal to playing poorly in the end.
---
Wow 20 ducking skill checks how fun it’s almost like eve with ruin staying up for even a minute WOULD DO WAY MORE I’m sorry man but 20 tokens is a joke and the perk would be gone in the first minute of the game there are 4 survivors doing gens the tokens would fly by way to quick and then you’d be back to being a killer with no ruin and no gen slow Ruins good because it’s possible to stay up long and can really slow down the game
---
Bethesda: Sells game and tacks on microtransactions and a subscription service

Behaviour: Sells game and tacks on DLC which heavily impacts gameplay, microtransactions, and a battle pass.
---
Oh that's completely fair! I honestly hadn't thought about that. I did know that I had to make her at least a little bit sultry (perfect word btw), since there are so many horny huntress mains in my audience LOL. But after the reception of this piece, I'm startin to feel I should paint more killers just as they are! :)
---
Lmao I fucking hate that this makes me laugh
---
I'll consider it a win if I get 4 stacks of bbq and just 1 kill. I also don't care what survivors consider as me losing I was just stating my experience.
---
Try not changing the subject. And no, i didn't downvote anything
---
so scared to take m hand away then there is no skill check for 10 seconds and i just think to myself i could've ate y snake perfectly fine no issues so i get the snake and \*skillcheck\*
---
She was always C tier at best, and shes been nerfed 6 times now... so... not just one...   
---
This is coming from someone who red ranked every season maining her, so not just salt, i felt the pain ;-;
---
&gt;Fuck me
---
Be careful with that expression in this context
---
this made me laugh more than I should have.
---
Wait really? Damn that's some good info. What about on the hook? That seems a little less likely.
---
I never got to red ranks, and I’m new with her. But I wish I could’ve have played her before the nerfs
---
You've been making the same point for an hour. If you hate it so much stop playing. The community will do fine without you.
---
Yeah. The piece is great, but I think an action shot of her in your style like this Plague piece would be amazing
---
It’s fun to mindgame as them
---
Someone please downvote/upvote me. I don't want to be at 69 on comments about Freddy Kruger.
---
When ever I see this the killer goes try hard mode then no one even him gets anything.
---
Yea those fence loops are something else. They aren't garunteed to spawn every game luckily.
---
The entity would like to know your location

Nicely done

But..but...it's baby Myers..

Hot take: make gens take longer, but put spark plugs, new belts, coolant bottles, etc. around the map so "doing gens" means moving around to find parts that make doing gens easier.  Survivors have more to do and gen-rushing is solved.
---
Take it further: putting a part in a gen puts a threshold on its progress, and when the killer kicks it, it'll only regress to that threshold instead of all the way down.  So if you want to work on one gen at a time, you can do that, or you can go around the map and put multiple gens at thresholds.  Fixing gens has two separate playstyles instead of "hit the QTE."
---
Won’t matter with region locks as upcoming events will be the same experience based on the simple fact that killers get more XP than survivors.
---
Trust me I don’t run NOED
---
The only time maps matter to me is when I play killer, which is 60% of the time. I personally LOATHE Yamoka's Estate, so horrible with how long it is. I even play Freddy and still hate how tedious it is to patrol gens. Not to mention you cant see shit.
---
Porn too
---
I would love to say she softens up but Halloween 2018 really says otherwise. At least someone is always thinking about Myers so he isn’t forgotten
---
She is so gorgeous
---
Wow it's almost as if I like the game but hate to see how greedy Behaviour has become. Crazy, right?
---
Peppppa... what are you doing in my reddit feed
---
Noticed that, too. Makes it look like her right leg is a good few inches longer than her left.
---
Yea, either side has ways of being unfair to the other. I never bring keys for cheap hatch escapes or mories (except for trophies and dailies) because it can suck so bad to play against that. At the same time you want to have the best chance at success so you can understand the reasoning for most playstyles even with the toxic players expressing their frustration when they think the game is being exploited against them. Playing both sides makes for the most fun and least stress, with the added bonus of insight for counterplay. If you have difficulty with facing any specific killer, the very best way to improve is to play as them for a while. Same goes for countering specific survivor perks.
---
I would shit my pants if some crazy fuck pulled me with his chain while laughing
---
According to her lore, she was.
---
All those swamp files have been in the game since hag
---
I would be totally down to do this in the future! Although it might just have to be for Halloween next year since I have all my artwork planned all the way up until February lol
---
I have played a lot with swfs on coms. but compared to how much I actually play it is negligible. And it is easier but if you need swfs to rank up. Then not meaning this as an insult or to be rude to anyone. But that person needs to solo que and practice at being a team player and a good survivor as solo.
---
But I also never care about escaping. I aim for 25k plus in points. And always go for the hero play at end game. If you get hooked even if there is NOED on board. I am looking for it and or just going straight for the save. And I will sacrifice my escape for yours. 
---
I find it way more fun than worrying so much about escaping.
---
Getting those points btw is very easy in theory. Of course bad matches happen but just always be doing something. Chases, gens, heals, saves, totems and you can hit 20k plus pretty consistently
---
I like to run OoO + Sole Survivor and I’m a solo que main. I don’t run it to be toxic, I make sure to just glance to get position info and keep my distance. Since I’m used to queuing with terrible teammates, if they die it just benefits me in the late game because I can see the killer but they can’t see me.
---
As killer my most hated map is haddonfield, and as survivor probably lerry, i don t mind game and hawkings. I play survivor more.
---
Fair lol
---
Yeah as long as their icon still doesn't show that they were sacrificed you can get stacks.
---
This is really useful as Legion who can get two stacks almost instantly.
---
This is legit me

Known bug, best you can do is contact the devs and reply with what they ask in the reply email so they can compensate you with some bloodpoints
---
ok but the top comments are all complaining about the halloween event being delayed. so partially it is about the "stupid event". anyways like i said, im easy with the delays because i am kinda burnt out on dbd and tbh, i never had any qualms with how dbd was  when i was really invested into it. I get that the rest of you feel burned by BHVR and the delay.... but hey, some things in life just dont work out. You can be outraged or disappointed, that is fine. However, I honestly feel like BHVR seriously try their hardest and do a good job most of the time, and deliver a good deal of what they say they will put out. I reckon BHVR will try their damnedest to make it up to you guys if that is any consolation
---
It's because of Feng Min and The Spirit
---
You couldn’t possibly be more wrong. Its not about whether or not end game pig was good, it was the fact that she had more than one strategy she could use and she could adapt in the middle of the game if her early wasn’t going well. Now all you can do is pray you snowball with her because her traps late game are useless. Also nobody is acting like she went from god tier to shit tier, we’re rightfully pointing out that she went from B tier to why even bother tier. If we just let them randomly nerf already bad killers without saying anything then they’re just gonna keep doing it.
---
My internet connection is fine, I have fiber with 600+ Mb, is just this game... this fkn gameeee

Glad you posted twice with different titles.

---
Downvote and then upvote to upvote 2 times
---
Depends on what progress you are talking about. If it is rank then that resets every 13th of the month. If it is leveling and bloodpoints that got reset, you were probably playing in the PTB as progress does not translate over to live servers.
---
They're really situational perks and you're using two slots to pull something like this off once in a great while. Not exactly game-breaking.
---
Trapper also could've just not ignored the crawler to tunnel another survivor.

---
It is not about delaying the game. It's about a) giving poor information and b) taking so long to tell us. They knew they wouldn't give anything on the 22nd; why did they wait until the day before? And why have we got nothing since?
---
Communication is important. At least a teabag or flashlight click from them would be nice.
---
LMAO i'm happy that i got the reference
---
Love it!
---
This is always so embarrassing to me lol. I feel like such a fool when I'm trying to be the cool generous killer but I end up mindlessly wandering with a survivor on my shoulder.
---
When the wraith buff shows up
---
Lots of cry babies. LOL!
---
Noice
---

We can only hope the devs see this and take it into consideration :)

I hooked a dude the other day and all 3 people were behind a rock waiting to save him... Smacked one, creeped on the other to trigger t3 on Michael Myers. Then just walked up and slapped the guy trying to unhook. The guy that was unhooked hesitated and I slapped him... 3 down right there. The other kept circling so I just went and slapped him. They raged at me for camping........if my only job is to kill 4 people and all 4 of you are right here, where else am I suppose to go?!
---
Or down them and get another 4 hits. Then kill them
---
Extra bloodpoints are part of the event but not as result of the bloodhunt. This year the pustula petals will spawn special gens and hooks that once completed/used will award bonus bloodpoints.
---
Swamp maps are trash imo. Yamaoka is also a yikes, same with ormond and base asylum. I don’t like Rotten fields either
---
It's the fastest way and highest pressure on killer too.
---
Wholesome
---
This game has a huge following in the drag community and I love it
---
Just vibin on the gen tho
---
Demo is more fun to play and I don't feel like trash for playing something unfair
---
The second generation are the siblings who wanted to be just like their older siblings ( *trap based, high mobility &amp; area effects* ) 
---
The third generation women said “fuck it I do what I want” while Bubba decided he could never live up to his brothers legacy so he made his own.
---
Honestly love the idea. I've always wanted a Killer that used chains like this, but I feel like their could be a better name for him than "The Grin." The Joker could honestly work, seeing as we have names like The Ghost Face and shit like that. I think "The Jackal" would be a good name though.
---
Rin??? Is that you???
---
No, no.
---
Killer bad survivor bad. Get it right, give me internet points.
---
dude (or mam) this is absolutely incredible!!  You are very good at your craft!
---
I believe moments like these are more common anymore to make people dc, that and them getting farmed then the killer tunneling them
---
you really dont need the good/best Killers to play

They've been doing some good work on it to be fair. The overhaul was huge but they're suffering a player retention problem right now.
---
The funny thing is, even if you follow this rule, it can force you to tunnel lmao, I was in a game where one guy was dead, everyone else was on death hook except one guy, and I wanted as many hooks as possible, so basically yeah, I "tunneled" him. If I killed one of the other two than it would become a hatch game and they wouldnt save each other.
---
The patch introduces a new event, new quest system, new balance changes, and a small mtx that also has free content and has only been delayed for a week. How is that even remotely comparable to Bethesda who put major features behind a 100$ per year paywall and delayed updates for years? This is not comparable at all.
---
It's a hoodie and it is official from their store 😁 it's such a cool look and I'd mentioned that it was cool a few times which is why the gf thought it'd be a good gift, which I definitely agree 😁

I wanna only play dbd but mk11 hit diffrent

killer literally had noed lmao

I was thinking of the name Boyfriend because of a concept I had with two new survivors who are a couple. The male survivor would have his own perk called Girlfriend, but I haven’t been able to think of a good idea yet. 
---
And I like that idea! Reading peoples comments the perk seems a little underwhelming, so that would add a little something extra to it!
---
Thank you! 😁

Doesnt dying light turn off if the obsession dies

I get you 😅 I've got mk10, would get mk11 if it wasn't so much £££ 😅
---
This is amazing. Thank you
---
In a single post. I think we found pure talent
---
I would be carful about this if it happens again I’d just DC cause if the survivors report it you could end up getting a ban
---
My number one choice would probably be alert but I feel like there is a good chance people would use that one. If I’m trying to pick an underrated one then I actually really love deja vu. Maybe that or tenacity or detectives hunch. This is a pretty cool question OP.
---
This is truth

I only chose him because of his popularity and because he doesn't have any "powers", just a plain ol human

---
Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader were completely different examples because they were major characters packaged ON RELEASE and getting them required the same currency that was tied to progression.   
---
In DbD you use an entirely different currency, that is only indirectly tied to progression, and its for content that is post-release DLC. BPs is not at all a legitimate argument because thats the progression system and the only other alternative is to just scrap progression and give everyone everything which is moronic.  
---
I get that you might be mad about DbD delaying updates or about their development style. But these are not at all fair criticisms to levi at the devs. Saying BHVR is like Bethesda because of the current circumstances is like calling someone a communist because they like social security. It's a dishonest and bad faith comparison.
---
You can but I've heard it can get you banned.
---
You did what you're supposed to do and they're just salty they lost, probably more so when they saw your rank.  As a survivor, sometimes when a strategy isn't working, it's time to re-evaluate the situation and approach it differently, which they clearly didn't.  Some people just don't take failure well so they have to project that frustration onto something else.  Don't let any of that discourage you, keep doing what you're doing.
---
Waaaaah
---
Oh ya ik just giving you a warning in cause it does happen again cause it is a glitch some ppl are abusing and you could be hit in the crossfire. So ya if it happens again I’d just dc right away
---
Do you remember when unlocking cosmetics in games was free? Imagine a time where you could just earn new outfits by playing the game. Crazy, I know, but we used to get that. We used to get the bare minimum for *free*. Hell, we used to get cosmetics in Dead by Daylight for free, or at least a way lower cost. You can still pick up the Bloodstained Sack which is $3 for 4 outfits and they aren't just bland recolors of the normal outfits.
---
That's what most YouTubers do when they aren't interesting themselves.

tfw when baby dwoot is in a locker but killer is huntress
---
Nah what pisses me off more is when I am working on a gen and I am 90% done then a teammate comes and we see a killer coming to us, but we both commit to completing the generator and right as we are 99% the teammate misses a skill check.
---
She would have caught the survivor by now.
---
lmao
---
Indeed, that video won a saxxy.
---
I rather get more points than kills bud
---
It’s likely you just weren’t far enough to actually throw it down I’ve been on both sides of the scenario.
---
Kills give the most points tho. You make literally no sense
---
I’ve missed ds in so many of these situations
---
The real problem is gen grabbing. Almost impossible to gen grab on dedicated servers.
---
It comes down to sheer incompetency across all levels, from the top down period. BhVR should have had battery backups, along with their data being backed up. 
---
It’s called “REDUNDANCY” 
---
But it’s always amateur hour at BhVR, also they have had a nice cash infusion for awhile now, so stop defending them. I’m glad to see the community finally holding their feet to the fire.
---
Edit: also to top it off was the slap across the face bs response we got from BhVR at the last min.
---
What if you were at the Hospital and the Dr. walks in and tells you “Mr. Shittle due to UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES we weren’t able to revive your mother and she died. Dr. Gets up, walks out and closes the door behind him. 
---
That’s exactly how BhVR did it...
---
tbh I'd rather have Daily Rituals being reworked than new content.
---
1. You get killer dailys 80% of the time
---
2. Rerolling actually changes it twice, so you don't get what you think you got until later
---
3. The bloodpoint rewards aren't very consistent, like Wraith getting 20K when most others get 30K for their challenges.
---
This doesn’t make any sense??? The command SHOWS up for me to throw. I THROW. And it doesn’t drop.
---
*Flashbacks to Otz*
---
Exactly what I was thinking of!
---
It's kinda why I miss his streams. A lot of his edits and stuff are kinda the same between videos
---
Gen grabbing isn’t as problematic. You can still kill and down a survivor. Survivors only have pallets to stun a killer besides flashlights and that only if you have one equipped
---
Sad
---
On the same day, same hour!
---
Maybe its a teaser for Japanese otaku survivors
---
Yes that is the whole purpose of having a perk, it affects the killer/survivor in some way lmfaooo. It shouldn’t be to just counter tunnelling (aka a personal play-style)

Oh I'm sorry for being annoyed by the fact that they seemed to have lost progress on the Halloween event while still, funny enough, being able to continue pushing the microtransaction update. Yeah man, my bad for being annoyed by how poorly Behaviour has been treating this game and its community. That's all on me, my fault, yeah, totally not Behaviour treating their fans like shit and this being the outcome. Nah nah, it's all fine. Behaviour can do no wrong. It's totally not on Behaviour for their fans being pissed off about predatory herd mentality microtransactions, pay-to-win DLC, and now a battle pass all while having to buy the game up front. Totally my fault for being annoyed by this stuff, not Behaviour.
---
\*he
---
The issue when running both, DH and Ruin, is that Ruin gives the Survivors an actuall reason to look for totems since the very beginning of the game. Else they'll just attempt to do gens and might consider doing some bones they randomly stumble across.
---
There is a reason why Devour Hope's first boni is that sly. The perk is supposed to be officially confirmed once the one-shot is there, which is the time when Survivors will shit their panties and run for totems.
---
With Ruin in the game however, you'll more or less never ever get 3 stacks or past. Survivors dont know which totem they cleanse, just that there are hexes. So if they pop Ruin or DH first is random.
---
When you want to have success with DH, don't run Ruin, 3rd Seal or Lullaby. Simply because those are the Perks that give themselfes away really fast. Haunted Grounds is a amusing synergy tho. When you want to dedicate entirely you can also go for Thrill Of The Hunt. Wouldn't recommend that when using an immobile Killer tho.
---
Didnt know Otz does porn good to know
---
Not problematic when you sneak up on someone and get a well deserved gen grab but then you get stuck for about 3 seconds then they just run away. Pallets arent broken on 40 ping, if you have 100 obviously yeah. They also have windows. :)
---
This is actually a decent idea
---
Immersed Steve Harrington gameplay.
---
Lol I wonder what Michael’s survivor perks would be
---
When you get hooked in the Basement
---
Killer mess up and let survs do 5 gens and open gate - his mistake
---
Killer mess up and hook surv in front of the gate - his mistake
---
If he hooked him far away from gate he could easly slug him
---
Would be proof that you had actually progressed in the game
---
Why are you acting like a child? you completely disregard everything said to you... then you spam "LOLOLOLOLOL", ye this sounds more like a tantrum than a reasonable complaint.
---
And?
---
with the old system, i reached rank 1 two months after i started playing. 
---
with the new system its difficult to say because a lot of the time i dont play enough games to reach rank 1 within a month. its been 12 days since rank reset. i believe i was at rank 13 and now im at rank 5. i could get rank 1. i usually do if i play enough. but it would take me a while since id have to pip 24 times.
---
but yeah, getting to rank 1 as survivor is relatively easy.
---
ive never reached rank 1 as killer. my highest has been rank 2, and im usually around rank 3-4. i would say getting to red ranks as killer is EXTREMELY easy but it can get difficult in those ranks to reach the top if you're playing a non meta killer
---
amount of in game hours (usually) doesnt matter. as for your rank, you have to understand that these arguments are because if you're low rank, it could be because you're bad. if you're bad, you'll say that things are OP even when they arent. if a large part of the community is low rank and bad and they say a non-OP thing is OP, BHVR might change that thing. do you see how that would be a problem?
---
Yeah. But he has bbq. Why would I waste my time playing other people for less points on average?
---
Even when I play poorly on bubba I earn more points on average lol. So why would I play anyone else.
---
source? spine chill immunity is a myers exclusive thing and not related to the undetectable change he will get
---
You know you can edit comments, right?
---
Nah its annoying your doing well getting points then he dcs
---
You miss out on points and fun because he is upset
---
I disagree its not a good feeling I dont enjoy making people upset
---
First of all, you didn't address any points I brought up. Deflecting and bringing up an unrelated argument isn't really conducive to discussion.
---
The time between the bloodstained sack being released and the headcase was 6 months. And back then the update quality was extremely lacking. We get outfits fairly often now and the update quality has skyrocketed since those days.
---
If you want to have a live service game, you have to fund it. Every live service game has some recurrent transaction that keeps it afloat. Otherwise live service games wouldn't be able to up their quality and cease to exist. 
---
If you perfer having no MTX then play a game that comes all in it's one package. If you play a live service game then MTX's are necessary and thats the sacrifice you make for having consistent and content filled updates.
---
I love The Game as killer. My opinion of Lery's changes depending on which killer I'm playing &amp; since I like to play Billy, Bubba &amp; Demo' I hate it more than I love it (Same with Hawkins). Both the swam maps, Mount Ormond, Haddonfield &amp; Cortus Penn mildly annoy me (especially if I see it as a offering). If I hate to pick one however my most hated map would have to be Yamoka Estate, as both survivor &amp; killer.
---
They're nearly the same thing. Oh boo hoo I added an extra word grow the fuck up

please. please use commas

Isn’t that over the maximum?

Bro I was mashing the shit out of edit but my phone is being a fatass
---
Omg, I didn't even notice! That's hilarious tbh. xD
---
Definitely. Just would've loved to see post game chat. It was the most well organized group of randoms I've ever played with.
---
&gt; Also the hatch mechanic isn't really broken or wrong in my opinion it just makes it hard to get a 4k which it should be
---
Inversely, why should a survivor have a chance to escape that relies on total luck if the team doesn't even manage to get more than two gens done before 3 people are dead?
---
Do you remember when games would be released and have no online mode, no updates, and no events? Pepperidge Farm remembers. By the way there will be free cosmetics and the Rift Pass allows you to earn back all the ($10 worth) of cells you spend on it. Servers and programmers and artists and licenses aren't free. This game has been available for a few bucks and almost all dlc has been available for less than the cost of lunch at one time or another.  There are also iridescent shards that allow you to avoid paying for some things in game with actual cash. Pretty good job so far...
---
Maximum possible blood points is 1,000,000
---
&gt; EDIT: Why is this downvoted? People legit do quit so the last person can have hatch. Downvotes dont change that.

---
OP is talking about the people playing the killer, not the killer's ability.
---
heres what im angry about.
---
the thing that bothers me is that the patch was not ready before it was set to release. chances are that they had finished making everything but they encountered some bugs. and of course, that can happen. **but they should give themselves time to find the bugs.**
---
i think that they should be completely done with the patch at least one week before its set to release. that way they'll have the whole week to test it and find and fix bugs. 
---
if there truly were gamebreaking bugs, they couldve possibly been fixed in time for Tuesday if they had been done with the patch at a reasonable time.
---
aka im annoyed that they procastinate with finishing all of this stuff. events and patches and all that jazz shouldnt be worked on right before its set to release. it should be finished a while before so theres time to fix bugs and adjust things that need adjustment etc. and i think its perfectly fine to be mad at them for not doing that. thats not a human mistake. thats a conscious decision. they decided to take a risk by working on it right before its release.
---
No, they really arent. You very obviously have barely ever played killer so stop being a jackass
---
I was just gonna say I wish this was a sticker!

Peanits on the forums said that Myers gaining undetectable means spine chill will work, but he'll now have 0m TR in Tier 1.

It's odd that the devs have created this game that people are so passionate about that they get outraged with short delays...
---
Ah the ghostface conundrum
---
What the hell? Roast session out of nowhere
---
As a level 1 killer multiple times after breaks. Ruin is absolutely not needed to stand a chance. There are plenty of combinations that are effective.
---
Yeah it's a strong as fuck perk that definitely helps but it's not the only way to win. You don't really know wtf you're talking about. Just bitching to bitch.
---
It IS crazy, actually. The only gameplay-altering DLC that can't be bought entirely through free in-game currency is licensed content. And it's incredibly unfair to call it "pay to win"- not only are there plenty of perks that fill the same roles as Ruin &amp; BBQC in the game for free, but if you can't win without Ruin and BBQC, you probably can't win with them either. (I'm a terrible killer who hasn't unlocked either of those teachables and even I can still get a 4k with some regularity.)
---
Also, was BHVR supposed to watch the meta and then refund everyone once the playerbase collectively chose a preferred playstyle? Or are you mad at them for not being able to see the future when pricing their DLCs?
---
If you want to play a game without a DLC-based business model go play Friday the 13th for a month and then come back and tell us how much better it is.
---
ITT: OP comparing apples to oranges
---
Calm Spirit so I can have easy matches against the Doctor
---
and spirit. and nurse. and hag. and leatherface.
---
Not to mention OP already said they did all of that on purpose to try and distract the killer so the slugged survivor could escape. 
---
Nice going trying to make it seem like OP is an idiot and was playing poorly when they clearly stated otherwise higher up in the comments.
---
Read your whiny, salty bitch post ripping on every aspect of the game.  Why would anybody want you around here.  You obviously don't enjoy the game so why stick around other than to populate its sub with mindless salt?  Go find a game you don't hate.  We don't want to hear you whine here.
---
aw man, well that sucks. Goodbye mirror myers :(
---
Sometimes they do it just to sandbag I'm pretty sure, especially when you're the last two left
---
Give it a small chance to get a purple/red version of those addons and this will be a very fun and interesting perk
---
Wait. 
---
You're telling ME...
---
that you used to earn 1M+ bloodpoints...
---
PER DAY!?
---
&gt; The time between the bloodstained sack being released and the headcase was 6 months. And back then the update quality was extremely lacking. We get outfits fairly often now and the update quality has skyrocketed since those days. 
---
I'd say updates are just as slow as ever. Freddy rework took how long? A whole year or so? And wasn't that *after* they introduced all the microtransaction shit? Also, the outfits we get now are paid, so fuck the "free" players.
---
&gt; If you want to have a live service game, you have to fund it. Every live service game has some recurrent transaction that keeps it afloat. Otherwise live service games wouldn't be able to up their quality and cease to exist. 
---
I'm all for DLC in a live service game, I get they need the money for it. The issue comes in when I am expected to buy DLC, skins, and now a battle pass. Monetizing a game like it's a free-to-play game when it isn't is a completely shitty, anti-consumer behavior.
---
&gt; If you perfer having no MTX then play a game that comes all in it's one package. If you play a live service game then MTX's are necessary and thats the sacrifice you make for having consistent and content filled updates. 
---
Hasn't the justification of DLC for years been to support the game? Is that just not enough for Behaviour anymore? Are they really starving for cash that much despite consistently putting out DLC which sells like hotcakes and having the Canada Media Fund behind them? Are we also really gonna completely throw out the fact that they're still making money off of game sales? This isn't a free-to-play game. If it was, I wouldn't give a fuck because of course they gotta make the money somewhere.
---
Sure, if you're complete trash and make no attempt to survive outside of grabbing your ankles, yeah she's pretty tough.
---
I just had a game like that... tbh I felt bad so I couldn't even bring myself to type GG.
---
on the hooks just vibin'
---
I mean, they’re right to delay until it actually works. No one wants an event where everything crashes and they have to extend anyways. 
---
That said, maybe I’m being cynical, but “not ruling out next week” makes me thing we’re gonna have Halloween in November :(
---
They really are the same thing. If your face camping all you're doing it just standing right in front of them. And camping them is just standing/lurking near the hook. Also I was a rank 7 killer but I haven't played killer since last rank reset because I've been having more fun playing with my friend as survivor
---
To each their own I guess but I actively give away hatches to try and avoid the double pip.  Why be in a race to get up to sweaty key lobby city up near rank 1?  I intentionally try to slow that climb so I can enjoy some more chill games on the way up to that joyless sweat fest lol.  But I guess if you're just uber competitive you might want to get double pips just to do it.  Preference thing I guess.
---
my god. they could at least increase the length of the event, or give us a BP hunt
---
&gt; We do not want to rule out the possibility of having the update ready next week. 
---
im glad they arent ruling it out but the tone makes it sound like it still most likely wont be ready in time for halloween :/
---
A ding ding
---
Bing Bong wants a bong
---
I think that’s exactly what’s happening sadly. I’m glad they were clear with what happened but no dates really is frustrating.
---
Not to mention we had to wait this long just for an update...
---
I swear the moment I go to fix my hair it always activates a skill check
---
Because you're bad at him?
---
I'm terrible with the chainsaw killers, if I'd been grinding bubba it would have taken twice the games it took me with huntress, because I wasn't hitting people, getting hooks etc.

sounds like they have no idea when it will be released and will more than likely be after Halloween
---
Mini Mori
---
I hope they do a full rework for her at some point. She is fun but with all the recent changes she was clearly made for a different game.
---
Forgive me Lord for what I'm about to do
---
That hoodie is fucking fire that’s exactly my style. Looks like an old school slasher poster!
---
Honestly, I think doing your number 2, and then making it so you don't have to have the bar full to start frenzy would make them decent again.  
---
3 would be interesting to see.  I don't think survivors would take kindly to being able to be downed due to frenzy though, since it ignores looping to an extent, but the idea is definitely workable
---
I am, thank you for noticing.
---
Wow great input thanks for the downvote
---
&gt; Do I agree with him? Fuck no
---
"But here I go defending this nazi anyways LOL"
---
That was reworked recently, now dying light gets stronger every time you hook someone who isn’t the obsession, and stops working when the obsession dies
---
Just my $.02, but with no extra time, no extra BP.... come on BHVR.
---
Haven’t you fucked this up enough to warrant something? Extra Double BP costs literally nothing but would go a long way.
---
And no dates on the event doesn’t bode well...
---
I mean, the shoes add a bit, she's not that gigantic. And tall girls are pretty hot imo too
---
I get it that some people have paid full price for the game and every DLC plus some expensive cosmetics and there are some unnerving bugs and other issues still but this studio has been good to the community and constantly iterates on the development and this update actually exemplifies that.
---
Yes, only in the way i described it so they can sell more battlepasses
---
Bong
---
Everytime I play plague I get flamed for playing her lol.  Like you *shouldnt* be near your team for legion, and you ~~usually~~ shouldn't cleanse for Plague, but yknow how solo queue works.  
---
Im curious how theyd balance it.  Would all the hits have to be in the same frenzy or?
---
This really looks like its gonna be weeks before the release of anything new. They really should not have merged the events together, it was pretty foolish given how buggy this game is. One thing at a time
---
i guess that's what happens when you don't put a /s on your comment, huh
---
Same here, can't wait for that shirtless Susie
---
In a few words: they don't know when they will release the event and the patch. No x2 bloodpoints meanwhile. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
They're setting up to put the blame on cert for it coming out in like 2 weeks.
---
Lol does BHVR even work on the weekend?
---
low iq take
---
What did it cost? The quality
---
You realise the currency you need for the event is only on the free track right? And buying the pass does not speed it up
---
What perk allowed you to get a chance to free yourself like that?
---
:)
---
I love how he calls us cuties and cunts.
---
Yeah I was thinking about that being sarcasm lmao. Sorry, my /s detector failed once again
---
Yeah we get the event, just later.
---
You got outplayed Kapp
---
Why would they increase the length of the event? They've said everyone is still going to run the exact same length so what's the difference? 
---
Wouldn't you much rather they delay the update and we have a working build?
---
Great, another week (AT LEAST) of 4 instaheals every single game.
---
Dont care about update, want blood hunt.
---
Aight boys we gotta get that amount of upvotes
---
So that's what immersed Clauds feed of
---
Damnit I just ate, I don’t want to be hungry again.
---
Yeah, I think he'll be on par with Myers jumpscare wise xD
---
Well to get the tokens, you'd have to hit additional people in the same frenzy. And to down someone, you'd have to hit another person with regular frenzy first to activate it, then down another survivor in the same frenzy. That's so you can't just randomly find a survivor and basically instadown him.
---
I said not AS problematic. It’s still problematic. But it’s doesn’t completely fuck over a killers game. A survivor gets fucked over by a pallet that’s supposed to drop then they go down! 
---
Also not everyone plays on computers so yeah. There’s that. 
---
I agree your problem needs fixed but we know these devs take 8 years to do shit bc they just wanna focus on adding stuff people will buy. However if we are gonna prioritize I feel like it’s more game breaking to not have a pallet drop. Your problem with gen grabbing 100% should be fixed too but the devs aren’t gonna do both at the same time.
---
Agree
---
They’re still being frustratingly vague, they never actually said when the update would be out in the first place or that it was coming with the event.
---
She is awful to play against so not suprising.
---
Real gamer hours right here
---
Sigh..
---
If you can't see the correllation, that isn't my issue. There are more ways than one someone can be a prisoner.
---
November.
---
You probably didnt even read what i said about the event. I even tried to make the theory as short as possible do everyone would understand but i will make a Redo just for you
---
The serum was not on the free track in the ptb because it was supposed to work just like last year with its own offering spawning hooks and gens
---
But they changed it to free battlepass track
---
Do you understand now?
---
I see your student debt has caught up with DbD.
---
Wow this is a mess lol. I was willing to give them the benefit of the doubt abt it coming before Halloween but thats down the drain. In retrospect it seems very dumb to tie ur most popular event with the biggest (aka the most messy) update. They shouldve just done something like they did last year for Halloween and have the big update later instead of making them tangled together. I love this game sm but this year was sucky with management esp in the event department. We had no summer event barely a anniversary event and now a Halloween event is gonna happen in November. And not to sound like a greedy baby but they should do a bp event for Halloween or extend the event a week longer or something.
---
I mean it's not really buggy, but it's a long standing meme that Leagues code is absolute spaghetti. Usually it comes from champion interactions being buggy and stuff.
---
Yeh dat map shit
---
f r I c k
---
I really hope they stop those dumb tier lists about random shit, literally the most pointless things ever.
---
I just don’t understand why the event was postponed the day before... the PTB started on the 8th and ofc I don’t know when the issues were caught but they shouldn’t have blindsided people like that
---
I think your tinfoil hat is on too tight my friend. I read the whole thing to begin with.
---
As a Trapper I hate the Game map with a burning passion.  As almost any other killer I hate Haddonfield.
---
You are not "expected" to purchase anything. And are you for real calling optional transactions for cosmetics that don't affect the game in any way anti-consumer?
---
The freddy update was a mid chapter update that came at the same time as all the other mid chapter updates. There was no hiatus between freddy remake and any other update. And how is having optional cosmetics "fuck the free players"? The bloodstained sack and others were also paid remember?
---
Also nowhere did I say they were starving for cash. DbD still gets sales sure but most of their sales come out on releases of franchise DLC which they only get a fraction of the financial reimbursement from. I didn't say anywhere that 100% of all the MTX's they have are necessary, but having some is obviously necessary by your own admission.
---
Also you still haven't addressed any of the points I made about the completely irrational comparisons made to F76.
---
Grrr
---
Will give them points for communicating (in decent detail I might add) as they could've just stayed quiet.
---
Such a shame about the delay but I agree that it is better than crashes and frustration.
---
https://imgur.com/a/WVQzUy0
---
ok
---
E: obligatory humble brag that I also have 1300+ console hours AS WELL but again, ok
---
The devs are being shitty about it. Saw some staff in general telling disappointed people “to be glad we didn’t just leave you in the dark completely. At least we’re telling you why it’s delayed.”
---
Or use shred as demogorgon
---
Shouldn’t Freddy be an uncle?
---
We got 2 big updates(Curtain Call) and they delayed both updates. We will see the update in probably 3 weeks lol
---
The game
---
Launch the game and check your pustula petals if i am wrong about it ;)
---
Dark devotion is pretty good, not better than STBFL though
---
I wouldnt say instaheals are necessarily the most amazing thing to play against either. But I'm not gonna DC if someone pops a needle in my face. This does show a problem that Spirit is now unfortunately gonna probably get giganerfed over. BHVR has a tendency to giganerf killers whenever they're even remotely problematic.
---
My game doesn’t work
---
You know I keep that mf thang on me.
---
[Lifts shirt to reveal Snipping Tool and Microsoft Paint]
---
If it took them from the 8th to the 21st to announce that it was being postponed I wouldn’t bet on it being out by November. Their Q&amp;A is probably gonna be full of very angry people.
---
Yeah.  Not even giving a few days of 2x BP seems pretty weak.
---
I feel like, if I was a horror game director/producer, the one event I wouldn't want to fuck up would be the halloween event. Maybe that's just me though.
---
I don’t think they want to because there was rumors about a bloodhunt
---
d o g
---
A series of unfortunate events
---
And then it changes to “Kill 1 survivor(s) by your hand with the doctor”
---
There would have to be some balancing to make that viable
---
All the media says is "Baby Claudette, Hot Macmillan,  Vigo, Haunted Blight."
---
I just wanna kill for Entity's sake!
---
Stop fucking everything up lol
---
In what ranks do you play her?
---
Be honest...
---
Because definitely not red ranks. Red ranks SWF can deal with her just fine. Lvl 15 randoms surely not, but that's an overall issue of the game, not her fault.
---
I main her, and no, just playing her with a headset is not "gg ez", most people are just too stupid to juke her and prefer to whine and moan like a pussy instead of learning how to play against her.
---
Survivors are nothing but a whiny bunch of cunts and they ruin the game with their constant whining and entitlement, DC for E V E R Y T H I N G now. It has become ridiculously pathetic.
---
I've had it. I've absolutely had it.
---
Fr*cking facts
---
Gets a 4K as killer against red ranks swf - "God ! killer is so stressful compared to survivor !"
---
Gets tunneled and killed in 2 min as survivor - "..."
---
Because people don’t like to swallow their pride and accept failure. They prefer to keep their pride intact by any means, including by being toxic assholes and DCing (disconnecting)
---
Why are STBFL and Pop so low? Also wtf is predator doing in great tier? Its garbage on him
---
I’m just pissed that this means there’ll be an even longer wait for the new cosmetics for Myers and Ghostface.
---
By me (Instagram.com/love.punku) ✨
---
What do you consider “unfair”? Because if you’re talking about playstyle things like camping and tunneling, those aren’t unfair.
---
Wiki shows all versions
---
Kinda looks like a blowup doll.
---
Removed let’s not start a console war
---
Wait so you can’t dash attack down someone?
---
Revealing him still doesn’t work properly
---
I had hopes by Halloween but they have to send it in for certification on console that takes a week or two on PS4 at least. Now i'm hoping by Thanksgiving.
---
I'm defending one's right to free speech, even if their views are disgusting and disagreed on by most people. Stonetoss is "unique" in the sense that he's quite clearly a terrible person, but if we justify the silencing of people when we know that they're awful what's to stop us from silencing people when we "know" that they're awful. (IE when we disagree with them)
---
I'd rather let someone say "Hitler was a good guy" and ignore them than silence someone who says "Hitler made some interesting points."
---
its not stupid. to you it might be. but it makes the shit u say hard and discouraging to read
---
Wow and she's not sucking face with another killer and survivor! Good stuff! In all seriousness this is great.
---
You are on a subreddit dedicated to a game about murder.
---
Pig can dash, trapper can grab out of traps, window grabs, there are a bunch of things you can do
---
I’m on PS4 anyhow, but this guy here on the switch... I’ve had killers and survivors with lag. It’s frustrating all the way around.
---
Looking kinda fresh doe
---
They don't. They themselves have stated that they don't.
---
*insert spamming of reveal music*
---
I wish they put dedicated servers behind a paywall, that way I could just not pay for them and have a better game
---
&gt;Wouldn't you much rather they delay the update and we have a working build?
---
what are you talking about? they can delay the update and increase the length of the event.....
---
we don't know and probably won't know until the day of
---
Gotta look good for Daddy Myers coming up to snatch yo booty huh
---
lol *same*
---
The first is a safety pip, second is one, last is two, anything below it is -1 pip
---
nop. 
---
If everyone is doing a gen in solo then the killer gets the opportunity to interrupt everyone. 
---
If you team up, 2 or 3 of you, to fix a gen, you increase your chance to confirm the full repair. Which put pressure on the killer.
---
At the very end tho, it can be more clever to spread out if one of the survivor is dead.
---
you talked your penalty up from a parking ticket to a death penalty
---
Gotcha + Tinkerer on a map pressure survivor could be a tasty combination
---
What's the risk of having a flashlight?
---
Nah he likes to Save The Best For Last
---
My current Plague build is: Dying Light, Pop Goes the Weasel, Thanatophobia, Surge.
---
This build has fantastic synergy with her. DL+Thana you already know about, but since she downs Survivors the majority of the time with Basic Attacks, Surge activates pretty much as often as it's available (survivors refusing to cleanse at mid-high ranks + 1 shot downs = Survivors unable to get far enough away from the gen they were working on to prevent Surge's activation before going down). That 8% damage to generators Surge dishes out would normally only provide a killer with an additional 9 seconds of delay before the gens completion (3 seconds for the explosion delay + 6 seconds to repair the 8%), but when you pair it with the Thana+DL combo, you raise the repair time to 16 seconds or almost double the time when you've acquired 4 stacks of DL. This gives you more than enough time to hook your recently downed survivor, and punish the gen even further with PGTW should anyone have touched it.
---
With the damage from Surge and Pop are paired with the slowdown of DL and Thana, the survivors ability to complete gens slows to a crawl by mid game. This build is viable at high ranks, and has become my no.1 build for playing her competitively. The only times this build ever has problems is on the largest maps, but you could say that about most killers/builds. That aside, It really makes her a beast for survivors to go up against.
---
Okay? So fuck the killer then?
---
nah
---
Not really. They can move around and 2 perks allow you to recover from dying state. And they can be healed
---
More inconclusive, vague, non-committal language with nothing important told, sigh. I hope the Michael and Laurie cosmetics still come out on the 30th like scheduled.
---
Off topic, But id like a cleave perk for killers.
---
Split pressure is better in every way unless you need to knock down a specific gen really quickly. If the killer interupts 1 person there are 3 working on different gens and if the guy running is any good, it means 3 gens popping soon.
---
yeah, like when Legion had that one add-on that was super bugged and OP or something and BHVR would ban players for using it instead of just disabling it
---
Would be silly to even attempt it your account would receive a permaban when they catch you.
---
Shit happens I get it. I just hope whatever it is something semi special is happening on Halloween
---
Nice! This looks great. I hope you do more :D
---
I'd concur. OoO was single handedly making killers like Wraith and Ghostface useless.
---
I absolutely love running STBFL on him. It’s so satisfying to two tap those blendettes.
---
Wow, what a bunch of self-righteous cunts.
---
I love the art style. Nice to see a refreshing different style now and then :)
---
because all of it is tied together. we cant have the event without the archives &amp; rift because we need the rift to collect currency for the event
---
Not even kidding.
---
Scratch Nose : Skill Check.
---
Pick up pizza. : Skill Check.
---
Maybe I should unplug my kinect. DBD is watching me, presumably.
---
You'll get banned bud
---
Their fixes are probably causing new problems. Stuck in a loop.
---
Should've just done last year's Halloween event and done Archives in November.
---
I think he needs a total rework, although I wouldn't say no to minor buffs in the meantime. Losing his ability for M1 hitting a Survivor is pointlessly punishing. 
---
Really, I'd want to see them actually be, you know, a *legion*. I want the rework to have other AI gang members show up to assist the main Legion member. Have them pick up bodies and bring them to the hook, or M1 recently injured survivors to finish them off. It's such a shame there's 4 Legion members, = to the number of survivors, but they go unused.
---
Real quick calm down. I was referring to just before a command could appear. I can see two  factors causing this:
---
1. Killer is already in lunge or attack and was about to hit you
---
2. At the same time your brain just saw the command and they hit you within the delay from your brain to your hands.
---
In the first quote, the "you" I was referring to was to the devs of the game. If "you" want to make a live service game. "You" have to fund it consistently and recurrently.
---
In the 2nd quote, I was referring to "you" as in the players. If a player plays a live service game having MTX's in it is a sacrifice they make for getting a live service game. You don't have to buy them only that they exist in the game (p2w games are a separate issue.)
---
Next, the battle pass dosen't have major features locked behind it like the annual sub does. And BHVR delayed both the free and paid content together, not just the free content. F76 was also pay to win iirc while arguments for DbD being p2w are extremely weak at best.
---
If I seem like a jerk I apologize. But I am getting pretty well sick and tired of people on the subreddit all of the sudden bashing the devs to hell and highwater simply because they delayed the mid-chapter update presumably due to something out of their control (I've heard rumors of a power outage, but nothing to verify it.) Criticism is one thing but making completely outrageous comparisons to massively pay to win games with predatory MTX's is something else.
---
Yup it was completely stupid to link the event with the archive
---
More like if BHVR put "Super Nurse" behind a yearly $100 paywall and she moved at 150% movement speed and could blink across the map with perfect precision after promising that they wouldn't make Pay to Win DLC, and then tried to justify the existence of "Super Nurse" by saying that "She can still lose so it's not *directly* pay to win!" and "We heard that you wanted more strong Killers! This is what the community asked for!"
---
Bethesda is really going down the shitter currently.
---
Thank you :)
---
I wish they would have given us a blood hunt in the meantime.
---
most of the bhvr employess must be fired
---
Ikr lol
---
Just cuz it's a SWF that cooperates well don't mean it's toxic. I think some people forget that. Not @ you or anything
---
Haha
---
Goddess of DBD!
---
YES! I only tought about this change for the maps, I'm using Detective's Hunch and it becomes so good with a map
---
This is why I usually write "GG I guess?" or "That was a game; I liked the part where video games occurred." when I have a particularly short / weird match. Gets a bit of a laugh out of the Survivors. I hope.
---
most definitely
---
Dude it looks like you're flaming a kid for being annoying in a videogame..... you sure you don't wanna delete this?
---
There is a mobile version?
---
All those cosmetics are in the patch so don't count on it.
---
Nope
---
Optimal
---
Elephant noises
---
I'm fairly positive this breaks subs rules for witchhunting no?
---
They should at least turn that switch on and give us extra blood points until the patch hits, but this is BhVR we are talking about...
---
And not that long following an expansion and a wave of new players. Great first impression so far.
---
Hey, that's what I'm doing! Leader, Open Handed, Detective's Hunch, and Better Together.  
---
You get a *huge* range once you pop 1 gen, and with a map it makes tracking all the totems cake! Can't wait for the DH changes when the update drops, it's gonna be stellar.
---
no cause you can hurt one guy then interrupt the next gen which isn't done neither since only one dude is on it etc... in order to apply a global pressure
---
Nice strawman.
---
Enjoy.
---
BHVR doesn't give a shit. I lost bloodpoint/rank/survivor level progress one night, and I submitted a ticket. I was told I was a liar, and that lying about progress loss can result in a ban. Like... cool.
---
***sad wraith noises***
---
This'll probably delay the releases of Dedicated Servers also
---
Hey BhVR stop putting out BIG UPDATES during Holiday events!!! You guys always Fuck up something...
---
My thoughts exactly.
---
Uh... Dedicated Servers have been in the game for over two weeks.
---
brown balanced landing brown balanced landing
---
battlepassbad
---
epic take by an epic gamer
---
you don't need to kill anyone to pip as a killer. If the game is that easy for you to get a 4k you might as well play with your food to pip anyway.
---
Pipping is the goal of the game since the only think that looks like a win for the killer is the entity appreciation in the scoreboard. Killing survivors is one way to make you win but not an end. It's even optional since you don't need to have 4 iridescent emblems to pip or double pip.
---
This definitely reads like someone who was told "Fuck it, it's friday, throw something up and lock the door on the way out"
---
If there ever was a company that could actually benefit from crunch time/overtime it's BHVR.  I know they pride themselves for not putting in more than the minimum amount of time every week but man it's really starting to show. The problems that keep popping up and piling onto existing ones have long outpaced their current team's pace of fixing things.
---
Detective's Hunch will change and now any gen that pops will activate it, my build Will be Open handed + Detective's Hunch + Kindred + (Bond or Spine chill) and of course a Map
---
All they care about is if you buy their overpriced skins...
---
I guess the obvious solution would be for them to stop screwing up so bad, which... doesn't sound so bad
---
uh, that is totally false, for starters. secondly, totally irrelevant
---
Just hoping I don't get swarmed 👀
---
Don't worry, I'm sure you still get him Dead Hard
---
Except he still howls like that big ass thing.
---
The devs accidentally published their Beta client as the release client on Xbox but they’ve already clarified they’re working on it.
---
Otherwise it’s mildly enjoyable. No real progression system and very unbalanced. You need a full co-operating team with mics, playing different classes or the Neighbor is going to steamroll you.
---
I’d give it a solid 2/10
---
BHVR is kinda lazy. Idk. I love the game and all but shit like this Nurse “nerf” should have happened a long time ago.
---
You just outplayed him with your superior athleticism
---
If you destroy someone because they are over matched saying gg can be kind of disingenuous. Complimenting any good efforts they made would be more productive, such as a good play or even a perk they are smart to be using. Not saying you're wrong to be polite, just that there are other ways to approach it.

You can, if they’re injured. But the game was changed so that effects like Exposed and perks like Save the Best for Last are only apples to m1 attacks, which means that the dash cannot insta down someone who is exposed, same as Demogorgon’s shred, Legion’s Frenzy and both of the chainsaws if you’re using the speed limiter addon.
---
Hi! I'm NA and a very casual player but always play alone so I'd love to team up sometime! I play on PC, and don't mind playing with mic and I can fend myself with English.
---
Wait, where’s the button for Ghostface?
---
Obligatory “DO ALL KILLERS NOW!!” Comment here. 
---
Also this is amazing, I absolutely love your style.
---
The game is not gonna load ngl
---
I’ve been going back to Fortnite since they have a new map and it’s been fun like back when season 1 was out, I also have been playing Granny and Granny 2 on my phone, those have been some fun filled jump scare games.
---
Edit: Fuck BhVR, they have really pissed me off with this bs, since the winter solstice event forward has been nothing but shit from BhVR Interactive who couldn’t code their way out a paper bag
---
Ok, so why not activate a bloodhunt in the meantime!? Zero reason not to this, for all the people looking forward to this time of year in the game.  Way to show how little you care about your community...
---
Nobody:
---
Speds at the pep rally:
---
Love it
---
For Otz to complain, it must’ve been something bad. Maybe something personal.
---
Some games just inevitably produce salt.
---
Can someone explain why they have to release the Halloween event with the mid season update, like why they cant just release them separate? Also, cant they give us a blood hunt right since they fucked up?
---
The big issue is they tried to update the version of Unreal the game operates on and it seems to have fucked a tonne of things up.
---
They didn’t need to update that, they could’ve got the Event and Rift patch out so we could actually play them, then work on updating the version of Unreal they’re on after.
---
However, this is BHVR and they never use common sense or do the thing that’d be right by their consumer so fuck us all, right?
---
Yea i agreed with you with everything till the insta meds... They are one of the worst things in the game in terms of balance, They where OP and now they are still good. at least they did not get MOM'ed
---
He’s mid tier and mediocre. Hat’s his shtick; he’s partially good in every way. A jack of all trades. However, he doesn’t have any outstanding traits because of that. People play certain killers because of their unique stats and abilities, and while the Demogorgon certainly has an interesting ability, he’s just mediocre.
---
As a customer support representative towards customers? Nah, even if they're a small company that shit don't fly anywhere.
---
this con center looks super familiar
---
Yah them ass hats at BhVR have left snarky smart ass comments on my post before in the past so it’s no surprise. But anytime I see any of the devs on stream it looks like the only requirement to work at BhVR Interactive is to have some tatts and piercings!
---
Lol what about placing traps as hag freezes the game for about 2 or 3 seconds
---
I find myers terryfing as he is just really realistic, but I see what you mean
---
It feels good its true
---
P3 Trapper &lt; YOU
---
Not playing tonight since BhVR still can’t figure shit out...
---
Nurse is much higher wdym
---
Otz did say you could also do it with the pig lunge
---
If you are good at micromanaging the exhaustion it can be good. It can waste a lot of time for the killer or just instantly cause them to break off chase. I'm torn right now between it and dead hard.
---
Edited for clarity
---
Dedicated servers have been fantastic on my end: I'm finally able to play Killer. No more subjecting players to infinite loading screens with my slow internet speed. They're not perfect though, hitboxes from vaulting aren't right, and certain Killer powers aren't registering properly, but otherwise they're a great and necessary step for DBD.
---
I genuinely don't get the frustrations. The community complains the devs break more than they fix. They are openly trying to produce a good event and new features. Still a lot of you are just acting like entitled cunts. 
---
Who cares if the event takes place in Halloween or November. I get it loses a bit of luster, but really? Who gives a shit. I rather have a better gameplay experience and an off timed event in terms of theme. But seems like I am in the minority on this.
---
What if they didn't share the same cooldown?
---
china lake op
---
This was posted here very recently, come on OP.
---
We definitely won't get the update in time for halloween
---
Yall needa chill tbh. Hes sayin they couldv left you in the dark but did they? No they released a update on the situation.
---
Why tho writing gg is just good manners
---
Looks like my sisters ex after she dumped him
---
Come and Get Me sounds horrible for the killer side but other than that I like the other perks.
---
You say this, but we used to have a 'Thoughtful Thursday' No memes/shitposts allowed.
---
It was removed because people got so upset at having 1 day out of the week when they couldn't post low effort bullshit.
---
This will be the downfall, 100%
---
Yeah, but like act like an adult.. write to support see if you can sort your issue out, making some weird 'appeal to emotion' post on reddit just makes people laugh at you.
---
I think that whenever you're in a certain area of the killer (very strictly not terror radius) the progress should NOT go down on the hook.  You should not reward terrible gameplay.
---
Wait a second whos taking the picture if both of your hands are in shot
---
I'm guessing part of the code for the mid chapter patch is referenced and used a lot for the Halloween chapter it's basically like a skeleton and without it there it cannot function and they would rather wait then recode some of that code to be standalone. I'm not a developer or coder so who knows.
---
I’d love to see it just out of curiosity. I submitted a support ticket and haven’t heard back yet and I’m kinda nervous lol
---
Jesus what the hell. That’s so inappropriate.
---
I didn't say it wasn't in the game I just said it was still in testing. They stated last month in their status update that they would be doing live testing in October on PC
---
If you don’t mind me asking what does DS stand for?
---
Outplayed
---
I'd like that, even if I believe you, just to see how they treated you
---
Good for a first one
---
Honestly Microsoft can be pretty bad at certifying patches. Like it can take them up to 2 weeks sometimes, so if they haven’t even fixed the issues and sent it off to be certified yet i’m guessing it’ll be the 5th of November at the earliest.
---
I'm a rank 4 survivor on PC, NA, lookin' for a group! I'd like to get semi-serious, but I'm not opposed to memeing around either. Avi on steam and I've got a Discord, just DM me!
---
There is no correlation because you cant compare spending money on a game to being held prisoner. What you're saying is just as ridiculous as saying that killing someone in a game is the same as commiting murder.
---
Inb4 halloween event coming out after halloween
---
Copy-Paste from a discussion with a friend:   
---
"I don't get the people who complain about stuff like that
---
It's not like they decided to all take 2 weeks off and say "fuck you we not gonna do it now"
---
And they sure don't make up stuff to delay the release so they have time and be more lazy about it
---
Shit just happens, and I'm sure they're working to get it out asap"
---
Edit: Complaining and calling them out doesn't make the event come faster. I know it's kinda frustrating to not have it on schedule but what kinda guy do you have to be to call them "shitty; self-righteous cunts" if you don't even know how BHVR handles their project management and work if something goes wrong.
---
Just because the profile picture is a child doesn't mean the actual person who uses the account is a child.
---
Hawt
---
Even if it's not, this is still blatant harrassment, which is never alright.
---
BHVR knows. They're releasing it on December.
---
How did that even work, she was turned
---
It 100% does
---
Somebody get on that mod i swear.
---
Some Claudette came up as I'm spamming A so I don't die and she just t-bagged and pointed to someone over 30 meters away then ran away. The other guy saved my life but wtf was the point of that?
---
Gg is just a polite closing, no? If someone is seriously getting angry over someone saying gg in a non-aggressive or taunting way they seriously need to get over themselves
---
Oh god damn it.
---
Honestly if Identity V's PC version wasn't just an emulator for the mobile one DbD would've shut down already.
---
You need to find yourself a new game, damn buddy. It's just a game..
---
"It's just a game."
---
Edit: further down below you're saying that you're gonna get rid of the game. Good choice, good luck further!
---
Oh I agree. But imo it’s irresponsible considering how many issues like this they’ve had in the past. I have a ton of friends who work in tech and while I’m well aware it’s not always so simple they should be leaving a margin for error. Also they waited until the day before the event to say they were postponing which was just.... sad. 
---
Perspective is important, obviously they didn’t do this on purpose. But it happens too much with BHVR.
---
If you want to win then yes you do but if you want to have fun then no you don't.
---
A lot of things should've happened a long time ago, yet here we are.
---
He can laugh so I assume he can at least hum
---
Agree 100%
---
and that is why you either dont drop the pallet or drop it really early.
---
Cleanse me mommy
---
Yeah I should have but here higher
---
With the Bone clapper in a map with a lot of walls maybe, overwise no
---
When the meme becomes too real
---
11/10
---
bruh i read that as they are trying to be transparent. you have some other type of interpretation?
---
They're probably not balanced but what I'm saying is maybe the time nerf isn't the way to balance it. I dont know. Just food for thought.
---
This was happening to me the other day. I was Nancy and Everytime I pressed R1, it wouldnt let me heal my teammate
---
Seriously, and they have fucking MICHAEL MEYERS in the game. It's like fucking up christmas in a Santa-themed game. Unforgivable.
---
Yeah, thats what I was talking about. It's the first legion cosmetic I actually want.
---
Ikr
---
No collision would cause so many funny bugs tbh xD
---
It might ‘just be a game’
---
But it’s the sheer lack of actual respect for their playerbase. They could’ve released the event and possibly the Rift on time had they not tried piling other things into the update.
---
Don’t be such an apologist, it’s people like you that lay back with their legs spread, ready to receive it that are the primary reason BHVR pulls shit like this and thinks it’s acceptable. Because there will ALWAYS be apologists and shills that excuse their bullshit.
---
“Sorry the updates delayed. Here’s some paid-only cosmetics though because we can manage to create and get those out on schedule” 
---
I’m pissed off. I’ve been playing since console launch and they’re still making the same old mistake time and time again.
---
He just stands there. MENACINGLY
---
I always say gg. It was a good game for me and if they choose to look at it as taunting then that's fine i suppose
---
Maybe they shouldn't have tied it unless they were absolutely sure it would be ready by release date, then.
---
ruin is for pussies
---
***no***
---
DS is just an acronym on this subreddit for Decisive Strike, a perk available from the survivor, Laurie Strode. It is an anti-tunneling perk. If you've recently been rescued from a hook, it will activate for 40/50/60 seconds. If the killer happens to down you and pick you up within that time, a difficult skill check will pop up. If you succeed at hitting it, the killer is forced to drop you and will be stunned for 5 seconds. You will now become the obsession soon after.
---
i feel like nurse in real life would be coming out of the walls and strangling you. not just blinking like she does in the game. nurse in real life would still probably get the most kills.
---
He seems pretty on brand to me
---
Nope, apologetic part of the fanbase will defend them and say we should be glad we're even getting anything, so they'll get away with it as always.
---
*’Hey guys it’s the entit... oh shit, ugh Nea here!’*
---
I never said it wasn't harrassment, just that the person who plays on the account is most likely not a kid.
---
That's true. Thats why myers would be so scary
---
for your last statement, i’m talking about just simple stuff like having preferences. for example, i can say my favorite killer is plague and my favorite exhaustion perk is lithe but.. because of my ranks, i just get told to play as the “good” killers (billy, nurse or someone else) and run balanced landing. i hear “that’s why you’re low rank” etc. but in reality i just don’t play the game that much. i think that’s what it is coming down to.
---
I'm scared
---
Look at all those Thanksgiving Cosmetics
---
You need to calm down.

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dn51pp/another_bug_but_this_time_with_the_rank/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Honestly it wouldn't surprise me if they just threw the whole idea away and never talked it about it again. Then when asked they'd just go "Lol, what? Dedicated servers? We never said that!!"
---
oh god i thought i was the only one, i played with the settings but it didnt matter. i did find out that its kinda related to what skins you use. so far medusa and swamp snake queen body piece seems to be causing it, replace the skins with default/colors of default seems to fix it
---
Yes... perfect....
---
“ clickity clack you’ve stepped in my trap”
---
„Be glad that we even talk to y‘all about OUR fuckups you ungrateful pieces of shit“ or something along those lines.
---
Oh of course not—can’t fuck with the BP economy, after all!
---
In what order?
---
I think event and archives should have more time to compensate on this delay.
---
Look on the bright side. At least the Halloween event and Christmas event will be back to back /s
---
This community can be so shitty at times. He's saying that they could have done that, but they didn't. Y'all need to stop being entitled little shits and at least appreciate that they're fucking trying. 
---
I'm upset about the event being delayed just as much as everyone else, but if they had released it on time and it was broken everyone here would be flipping their shit. Like fuck, theres no pleasing you people. It's honestly ridiculous. If I had to deal with this fucking community every day as my job I'd shoot myself
---
In a nutshell: I hope you like Halloween and Christmas!
---
There was one last year.
---
Yeah, suvs think they're the shit when they escape against a lvl 1 inexperienced killer. But baby survivors? Gotta treat them nice or you're scum.
---
They said they'd pass on the summer event to spend more time working on dedicated servers.
---
I would boop the shit out of the snoot
---
I missed the joke. Nice dead hard
---
Who is at the front? It looks like Wolf from Sekiro.
---
I find it really hurts you more than anything point-wise and winning wise if you are a low rank. when it comes to camping at end game I fully understand it as you are securing the last kill.  I used to play killer a lot before they removed vacuums and etc. but ya that is my stance on it. you cannot honestly get mad at survivors just doing the gens and leaving it is not there job to find you as killer it is your job
---
Could be both
---
so there a  mean way to write gg?
---
That’s ironic
---
DUUUUN
---
It's all fun and games still you get a trap on your head
---
If it was only a month ago that you quit, nothing new has happened other than a slight bug that mildly increased her movement speed while carrying someone. It's just a subreddit meme about how she's gotten like six nerfs in the past
---
I doubt that will happen sadly as it looks like the devs do not seem to really care about the delay inb my opinion anyway
---
No worries. I will simply stick my hands in a weird looking machine and shake them a bit.
---
I can see it now, The Trapper getting confused why everyone is celebrating Halloween while wearing Santa hats.
---
sick jukes and loops? we're in 2016?
---
How it should be used instead of a get out of jail free card.
---
&gt;by a week at most (whatever the memes and whatnot say, we’ll definitely have it in the next week).
---
You have absolutely zero proof of that.
---
True lol
---
That's just means more Halloween overall though
---
[The wiki exists for a reason, my friend. ](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Save_the_Best_for_Last)
---
GHARST FARCE
---
Yo send link
---
That was my initial assumption- my guess was that BHVR would have it out before Halloween.
---
However, within the space of two hours my comment aged really poorly.
---
i play both sides too and you're wrong
---
Well yeah that was my intention.
---
They never said there'd be a summer event. People just assumed it would happen and got triggered when it didnt.
---
Maybe the reason people are constantly annoyed is because BHVR fucks up constantly and doesn't fix most long-standing issues.
---
Other cosmetics have problems with freezing the game when loaded too. Spirit's white robes and Nurse's wedding veil headgears are 2 examples, but this is the first one I've heard of that actually causes issues in-game.
---
Ya know, I want to defend BHVR so badly (I liken them to a puppy with three legs that keeps shitting your bed but they’re so goddamn adorable and loving you can’t stay mad for long), but petty bullshit like this is inexcusable.
---
Can you link me to those comments then?
---
They didn’t do one so instead they could work on dedicated servers, bug fixes, optimisation and the Archives/Rift. Welp... glad they put their time to good use.
---
Oh shoot.
---
For sure. Especially considering they wouldn’t be in the line of work in general if people didn’t buy the cosmetics and DLCs and spend hundreds upon hundreds of hours in game... they should treat the community kinder.
---
Thought I was on r/killlakill for a sec
---
I can't disagree, a Bloodhunt would be nice. But at the end of the day, the devs are human too.
---
Yes, it's a Halloween patch, but BHVR isn't *intentionally* delaying the update. They ran into some serious issues that need to be fixed, shit happens. They're already working overtime to fix and release the patch, but a good chunk of this subreddit is bitching them out anyways like BHVR murdered their entire family or something.
---
This is not the first time Freddy has been roasted.
---
Not even a blood hunt for fucking Halloween
---
Which really means nothing for this year
---
Some killers don’t need ruin
---
i think its a really good change
---
removed for name shaming
---
How many more hours than you does your friend have?
---
This has happened to me about 4 times. It’s weird af but idk why it happens
---
I mean, obsession Freddy is pretty stronk with dying light
---
I’m calling it now, the update is gonna be super buggy anyway
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dn57qx/is_this_a_glitch/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
honestly double BP every other week sounds amazing. The grind is just too much rn
---
I’m just answering OP, there has literally only been the one Summer BBQ event last year.
---
They asked if it was a normal recurring event
---
I’ve been using it and you sure aren’t wrong. The only time I thought to myself “I’m glad I have second wind” was when I was unhooked by an injured person, healed them and by that time second wind healed me, so they didn’t have to heal me... but yeah it’s not too great
---
That it did xD
---
Happens tho.
---
I hate to say it cuz I genuinely love this game, but if DBD didn’t scratch the very specific itch I have, I’d have left long ago simply because of BHVR.
---
Yeah but the nea is a monster meme though
---
It used to suck to be a killer, now it sucks to be a killer *differently*
---
Nope, tier 1 Nancy perks and spine chill.
---
I'm still puzzled by how all those streamers who went to see them were so excited about the direction the game is going and talking it up a storm, when it's probably at the worst for both sides of gameplay it's ever been.
---
You're right. They'll probably get away with this, because everything is sunshine and candies and rainbows and Dead by Daylight is ''the best it's ever been."
---
I was just clarifying a bit further, sorry if it came off as agressive
---
HAHAHHAHAA, they might as well have done the event
---
Maybe it's just the fact that Halloween is not a big celebration where i come from but i'm not really mad about this. Like yeah, it does suck because i was excited about the Archive but we'll get it, just some time later. I personally don't care if the event is on Halloween or New Year's Eve but i can see why some people would be mad since BHVR does fuck up a lot.
---
Wait..what just happened ?
---
Damn
---
69
---
If  ya get it good for you
---
I thought his other perk was the worst (forget how to spell it) the one that helps with struggling on the hook?
---
Yea, he should definitely be able to chainsaw battle leatherface.
---
They treat you nice, depending on the mod you get.
---
I got Errol, fixed my save file and was genuinely nice.
---
They fixed my save game pretty quickly.
---
It's OK, I didn't get it either, and I know they call him Bing Bong Boi....
---
Some killers work pretty well without it. I prefer PGTW on freddy.
---
 (Camaraderie) It has saved my life once or twice when I was giving them a go but I don't like perks that presume failure and I don't like something that is only useful on the second hook.
---
RIP Halloween event which isn’t even coming out on Halloween LOL! Took 2 days off work for this as well and that’s waste of my time completely. Thanks Devs you shit cunts.
---
Well i'm already revealing ghostface while i'm not even seeing him, if he looked like this, you could reveal him from across the map
---
Shouldn't have tied the event to the new patch then. It bit them in the ass but look at every other game, you don't see them pushing out huge patches at the same time as an event.
---
Siege is doing a whole new mode for example. At the end of the day, it's a huge failure and a big PR flop, and a simple flick of a switch for double BP would go a long way with relations.
---
Omg so cute
---
I get it, Steve’s perks aren’t too great I guess. That’s a bit disappointing.
---
Can you atleast tell us if your going to have bloodhunt at the same time with the event? Ive been saving a bunch of my greens...
---
Amazing work!!!
---
they didn't say they were but judging by how popular it was last year you'd it was expected to come out. I don't mind that they skipped it to work on larger projects, but those larger projects were supposed to be the upcoming patch...
---
Oh boy! I hope I get a santa outfit when the Withering Blight event starts!
---
Another reason why DBD should be a T rated game.
---
I do this but it's Lullaby and Ruin.
---
Take a wild fucking guess about what one is popped first?
---
Why do survivors have the uncanny ability of popping the exact totem you didn't want them to break and they leave Ruin for way longer than it should have.
---
The sheer unnecessary anger in this comment is astounding. Looks like you should find another game if something like this pisses you off that much
---
Rude. Focus less on other people’s spelling and more on being a kinder person. Learn to be more mindful about what other people may be dealing with (learning new languages, learning difficulties) etc, your negative comments help nobody and it certainly doesn’t make you look smart or clever, childish.
---
Yeah my bad. Just confused about the downvote.
---
When you get a bunch of downvotes and you gotta post a Thicc Jane Meme to avoid Bankruptcy.
---
Yup... it's sad because I actually enjoy the game beside its faults. But I also can't really support BHVR anymore on principle. Maybe if this game had a competition they would get their shit together.
---
I could be wrong but isnt the cert process for xbox 15 days roughly depending on the size of the update?
---
I'm a baby killer and I she's one of the few killers I feel comfortable playing with. Why do they have to keep nerfing her? She's just a medium-low tier killer.
---
Also sites that sell weed if it ain't legal where you live.
---
It's Jake in his Hallowed Catalyst event outfit.
---
He's the only survivor to get one this year.
---
you dont even need them to win. It mostly depends on how well the survivors can coordinate
---
I just think madness in general needs a rework to actually fuck with the survivors mind. Like hallucinations that moves towards you ect.
---
Thanks for the encouragement, bud!
---
They run pass totems in general ? When ruin is up?
---
Community: Do the devs even test their game? This is a buggy mess LMAO this game is trash bhvr sucks
---
Bhvr: *Delays patch to fix gamebreaking bugs*
---
Community: OH MY GOD JUST GIVE US THE FUCKING EVENT LAZY PIECES OF SHIT
---
This is what I thought before playing this game. I honestly just leave the post game screen instantly as killer to avoid the salt.
---
*yawn* mods should ban legion “cosplays*
---
Bad games suck, but do enough by yourself and you'll rank up eventually. I have terrible games even in red ranks.
---
No. They wouldn’t. It would die if they had a solid competitor.
---
Yes but instead of saves/protection hits/flashlight or pallet saves, you get a stack per each individual survivor hooked the 1st time (25% bonus BP per hook = max 100% bonus BP per game).
---
Right? If someone is such a sore loser that they take someone saying "gg" wrong they really need to take a step back. If the game is bad just because YOU performed poorly then you shouldn't waste your time
---
Today I kept shaking my head no against people who went to cleanse against spirit, the two neas understood, but then there was a jake who cleansed it, ran into her, and killed himself on hook.
---
%100 correct
---
dedicated servers
---
I tend to play killer because of que times and bloodpoints. Started as a survivor, switched and have spent most of my in game hours as killer, all of them besides limited nurse and Michael and no spirit or demo so far. Just lately have been dumping time into survivor. Both are fun for different reasons and experience on one compliments the other in interesting ways.
---
Eta: what really got me addicted to killer has been BBQ and Chili lol. I really feel like We're gonna live forever needs a buff to justify using it beyond bloodpoints farming.
---
Im almost positive she does in fact move grass as she walks 
---
Or am I tripping?
---
It means killers no longer host games because of dedicated servers
---
Had a similar idea, but it would be nice to have obsession perks for survivors
---
The skins are part of the patch
---
“Mehhhh!”
---
If everyone keeps roasting this poor guy he'll actually end up looking like Freddy
---
The Game
---
It was on the test server so they had to mention it in the test server notes. Even if they didn’t it would have been noticed on the test server regardless.
---
Whatever I knew it was a mistake to start shit on this sub, I’m going through too much rn to start an argument
---
Yet y'all wanna be the guys that defend communists? 
---
Stop pretending you give a shit about bad people

Is that photo of you?

Lol, sprint burst, nah.

I’ve never gotten the reroll bug, it’s always the challenge that it says regardless of scrapping one
---
Nice dead 'ard.
---
Pop...

Geeg
---
It's funny how guys like you think entitlement means complaining about a company pulling the same bullshit they've pulled multiple times in the past and still treating it with a condescending attitude
---
Ash in everything else: "what's that there, a hulking deadite that grew like eighty limbs after I cut it in half being controlled by the embodiment of evil? Groovy, I'm gonna kill it."
---
Ash in DBD: "Oh God oh fuck it's a scrawny teenager with a mall ninja knife run"
---
You can also do the monto patented build of Thrill of the Hunt, Devour Hope, Ruin, and Haunted Grounds. Like you said, not as great on a wraith, but give those to a spirit or even long range doctor and devour hope becomes delicious.
---
r/dbdgonewild

Yeah, he is just a very annoying person

The last part is pretty much the truth to 99 percent of the Mods

I believe you just played a match with me on ps4. I was Laurie and you were Ghost Face. If so, thanks dude!
---
Losing it when you die...
---
Y’all got any of that withering blight?
---
I just want my ghostface outfit
---
Oh. Thanks. It looks cool. Wish the event was happening right now.
---
They do absolutely nothing for the game
---
So I'm not sure how common this is, so I'll explain. I got into a match and the killer was running Hex: Ruin. All game I ran around the map making tons of noise, failing skill checks but never ran into the killer once. My other teammates were doing the same thing. At one point we all met up at the totem that we had to destroy in order to remove the hex but as you can see in the video, none of us could reach it. Fast forward to the end of the match, we all survive and are chatting about what had just happened. Turned out the killer was playing Wraith, found his own totem, went invisible and stood in front of it. His in game name was "Practice Ruin :)". Thought it was quite funny and would definitely be laughing, seeing it from his perspective, at all of us crouching, trying to reach the totem. Anyone else had this happen to them before?

Anytime
---
Get fucked
---
Probably but I have just been lucky I have never experienced majorit any of these bugs people report.
---
Doesn't change people are acting like entitled cunts about it.
---
I would run too if they had three arms
---
You know I completely forgot about iron maiden applying the exposed status effect I always thought of it as a huntress only perk for reloading hatchets...
---
Yeah, like every person with a brain
---
It's almost as if its Halloween and people want to enjoy themselves.
---
Actually we already have dedicated servers that's why the game is currently running like it's being hosted by a Bosnian in the 90s.
---
It's Yzma from the Emperor's New Groove.
---
I don’t see why people have a hard time understanding why people DC. They act surprised but the answer is obvious. This game can be incredibly frustrating and if you have a bunch of unlucky and shit games in a row someone will be more inclined to DC. It’s just logical even if it’s cunty.
---
I mean, the bugs are in the game for 3 years so they fixing it now doesnt make them the best devs
---
If you liked Dead by Daylight, I can highly recommend giving Identity V a shot. It's basically the same game, negatives are that it has a Gacha system for most cosmetics, positives are that you play free and can unlock any of the gameplay content for the in-game currency.  
---
 If you've got a strong phone, the mobile version is really solid. If not, they've got a cross-compatible PC port that runs great on my non-gaming laptop.
---
lol im sure if I care yet my guy
---
Because Micheal is just misunderstood
---
GG I guess? Is kind of a dick thing to say lol
---
Welcome you are
---
Was that Dead 'ard?
---
Your job is to entertain the entity, sacrificing is just another aspect of the whole entertainment the entity has set up for itself, as you all have already been sacrificed to it anyways.
---
Now I feel bad.
---
Yeah but now instadowns don’t work with her ambush since it doesn’t count as base attack, which is total bullshit.
---
My only problem is we're probably going to get both. I.E. even though it was delayed, with an "Engine update" coming along, I predict everything will be broken just like the third year anniversary event.
---
Oh yea I see him!
---
Skipped summer event so they could work on dedicated servers and archives/rift BTW. What a trash tier game "studio".
---
ahhh. well, theyre somewhat right. ur definitely allowed to have ur own preferences regardless of ur rank. but when it comes to exhaustion perks in particular, not prefering balanced landing is usually because someone doesnt know why the other exhaustion perks arent so great
---
No, Pig was also at least C tier, but she’s constantly getting nerfed for no reason so....
---
And? 
---
You're an absolute fucking moron.
---
You're the type of moron who believes everyone right from stalins nutsack is a Nazi.
---
I see you're calling everyone an incel and a Nazi, meanwhile you're defending the brutal attacks from the Chinese communist government against the Hong Kong protestors... Such surprise
---
This is wrong, clown should be walking with his thumb up, that is his real weapon
---
This is awsome
---
Honestly I don’t know why they just won’t reactivate last year’s event and give us the flowers lol
---
|n＾ω＾|η
---
Big boat: BWOOOOOOMP!
---
Small Boat: bweeeeeeeeep!
---
I know its power-based, but swap Huntress and Freddy. Huntress is literally a 5 year old and she is more mature than him
---
I love it, you look amazing! Myers is one of my favorite movie slashers!
---
Yeah, I said "maybe" because the other option would be death.
---
Not really. Look at literally any other online game. Everyone has their losing streaks in League, DotA, Smash bros, Fighterz, Auto Chess and etc. Even when players get shit teams they still play, sometimes there's quitters but its never something that happens every three games  (or every game depending on rank). 
---
Quitters are a bad habit, players who quit the moment things aren't going their way, because dbd has no punitive system. It's not "someone who's had shit games in a row", it's someone who doesn't have the patience to actually put in the elbow grease and *play the game properly*
---
I understand that working on programming a game is not easy in the slightest.
---
I understand that it's better not to release buggy and botched updates, even if it implies putting it off. 
---
But I can't understand that such a big update is tied to a yearly event of such relevance to a horror game, being fully aware that if the complex update doesn't work properly, there will be no event on time.
---
I'm sorry devs, but you haven't done a pretty good job so far. Not this time.
---
Everyone needs a hug, especially silent killers that killed multiple people.
---
Its fine. I got downvoted to oblivion earlier for not putting /s on some of my comments before. Now I learned my lesson.
---
When you're feeling salty anything can seem like an attack. There is no way to judge tone in short text messages, so people can read into shit, justifiably or not.
---
She DOES move grass and you can hear her footsteps while phasing, I usually use that info when I have to drop the pallet on her or not.
---
How dare you kill me as the killer!
---
Welp guess ill be playing Red Dead 2 sorry guys!
---
Well now I'm upvoting everything and I'm sorry.
---
I get mad by flashlights easily, even if they aren't being toxic and spam clicking. But I do understand that they are just trying to survive
---
I was just like „I think they have a bush fetish“
---
That’s the spirit
---
It’s funny that you think League punishes people for afking. What a queue timer? That’s nothing lol
---
Identity V: Tons of themed cosmetics, custom games have the Halloween-themed map, free currencies of all types for normal play, bonus event currencies for extra content, free A-Tier cosmetics for an S-Tier Survivor and an A-Tier Hunter, and lots of little flavor with a small story and personality test themed for the event.  
---
Dead by Daylight: We released Stranger Things DLC before updating our engine, or moving to dedicated servers, or implementing our keychains and battlepass. We have been scrambling to fix this since, and have no new information for you. You need to get off our backs, this is a lot of work. In the meantime, you can buy some event cosmetics for $10 each.
---
The game is so unfun when you played for 1000+ hours that all we expect is a event 4 times a year
---
I get that, but I dont think the appropriate response is that we should bar ourselves from saying GG because it's somehow rude? I think we should tell crybabies to stop reading into everything and realize not everything is about them
---
Yeah, I was thinking of that so more "slow" killers could actually use tinkerer in their kits. Though it would make spirit extra broken now that I think about it lmao
---
To be honest, it probably is. I don't really blame them either because IIRC DBD's super early stage (When Claudette was white, Meg was black, Trapper was called Chuckles, etc.) there was like two people working on the game IIRC and they probably didn't expect the game to come so far. 
---
Like IIRC it started as an indie project. The original programmers probably weren't expecting to add tons of more killers, events, dedicated servers, maps, etc. which is a problem when stuff is constantly added onto it and bugs happen.
---
This is the bgs?
---
This reminds me of a card art for a god in Smite.
---
Thank you! I'm glad that you enjoy it!
---
Just let him pretend
---
Any chance you could actually provide a real quote instead of inciting people with your rumor?
---
Dude that looks sick as hell! Tell your GF that she did a damn good job!
---
I would play killier for my achievements
---
Why do you post this twice? The only change you did was cut a little bit of the screenshot
---
Lol poor Myers always being bullied in these panels
---
I only have played Survivor,  but watch my son play Killer most of the time. This helps me play Survivor better....or try to anyway
---
Yeah, I do it as a blanket policy with a similar mindset. Depriving the other side of a GG cause you feel they didn't do well enough seems a bit absurd to me.
---
I made the mistake of doing a degree in Games Development and in our final project updating the engine caused some issues, and other times you'd save the build fine, open it up again and suddenly bugs appeared that weren't there before.  As for the Certification, they've to send it to sony/microsoft/nintendo for their releases as  they want all releases at the same time. Shit happens and bugs appear with no reason as to why (The Wake Up! wasn't even changed in the patch it became bugged).   
---
Love the game when i look past the game-play issues. However I'm not a fan of BHVR's game play choices but what can you do. 
---
People are saying the devs are making comments, chances are they're gonna annoyed by personal messages or back-to-back hateful comments about it. But like people said, BHVR have so many issues so frequently that its just one giant annoyance when its something people were so hyped for and the preview video. :(
---
Least they're postponing it and its not gonna take away from it in the end, plus it gives people the chance to play other Halloween Events in other games instead of forcing themselves to play DBD, it's not your normal Halloween event so can still work? I love Halloween themed stuff so for me personally it'll just extend it after other games stop their events. \\o/   
---
Hopefully next year they'll focus on game-play and fixes as oppose to just more stupid DLC that'll saturate the game even more
---
Whenever I play pretty much
---
More often then survivor
---
Could still be possible if they release it for PC immediately once it's ready to go. I see no need to make PC wait weeks for absolutely zero reason.
---
You and me both lmao I was just legitimately wondering because I haven't used ds since the change and it actually looks like they made the skillcheck larger. I was just comparing it to how brand new part looks or overcharge
---
I guess people around here are just survivor mains, because if they played both sides they would know how it feels like to play against 2 needles and they wouldn't downvote you.
---
This reminds me of Winnie the Pooh a bit.
---
You can go to their official forums and see the dev posts for those answers, and the answers are they're fine. The idea that people had where dedicated servers were going to magically fix the problems that came with p2p has, as expected, been completely wrong, since the majority of the community has no understanding of how servers actually work. 
---
The only thing that's really different is how noticeable some of the lag that you never saw as a 0ms host can be when you play killer, or you load into a further away server as a killer and your game is a bit stuttery. Anything else is basically the way the vast majority of games work with movement and lag comp, which makes it seem like you have a massive hitbox when you simply do not, or that you think the killer isn't in lunge range because it's a clown with a knife, who has the same lunge range as a billy with a much longer weapon. Or it's simply due to people not realizing their own ping to the server, or their own internet being shit. 
---
Before it was your ping to a 0ms host, so it was only calculating the lag to you and the host, but now it's a server calculating the lag to the killer and the survivor to the host that is the server, and this is made worse if you have a killer at say, 130ms ping to the server, while the survivor has 30ms ping - it means the killer is a lot closer to you than you realize and you will get tagged in a way that appears "laggy" simply due to the closeness of the two individuals and how quickly the action of a lunge is. So you could say that dedicated servers are, in a way, worse than peer to peer, for a game like DBD, sometimes.
---
I mean it's the same concept as TF2, where you can get backstabbed by a spy from the front due to the hitboxes of the models being the same as DBD, a large square, and the lag comp basically registering you as being behind the target when you are in front, or back before they updated the tick rate of OW servers and you could get shot behind walls the same as TF2.
---
well okay. You are right. :) I just typed that cause most of the time i play Rank 5-1. I am sorry if that bothers you.
---
lmao expected nothing less.
---
When you napraw
---
r/deadbuddyretard
---
I'm surprised it doesn't exist.
---
The downvote brigades are bad on every subreddit
---
That's why I'm starting to. lol
---
stalking hamburgers
---
Good rule of thumb, always let the losing side to be the first to say GG
---
After all, everyone knows that will drop the ebony mori prices in the player marketplace!
---
Rarely I’m a survivor main that’s hoping to get all my survivors to prestige 3 then I’ll work on getting killers achievements and then prestige 3. Then I’ll basically only play for daily or for the archives.
---
Wow you want to ban something that someone put time and effort into doing just cause some guy posted a legion cosplay that’s garbage ironically.
