Was just leaving the end screen of a game. When I got back to the menu the logo was pulsing at me threateningly and then when it vanished nobody was home :')
---
---
---
I'm so good
---
Spirit allows to some insane mind games, so nice to just stand there and watch as the Survivors don't know what to do!
---
can u people stop saying shit like this without explaining how
---
My duude. I’m sorry but you got it wrong. The notification shows up 20 meters away from YOU, the survivor throwing the rock. The killer gets the notif from anywhere on the map. 
---
Proxy camping and Definitely tunneling. When I’m running away and instead of going for someone else you come after me because I’m a one hit, down... it really frustrates me to no end. What defense do I have? And when I’m not the obsession and you still do it, that just makes me wonder who made you so mad in life. It’s the start of the game and I didn’t even get to do ANYTHING. So I get a little crabby. It happened to me twice, once it was a clown and then it was a trapper.  But a nice game with a Legion after that made it much better. 
---
Wait seriously? Oh damn thank you so much for telling me that, guess this post is useless now
---
Every day we stray further from the Entity's light.
---
Hexy or I think that's his name is a gay ass dick head, thats all ima say
---
You are welcome Nea.
---
Yeah np dude. Might wanna delete the post just sayin...
---
Okay see you I’m gonna delete it lol
---
I suck at Billy but I'm getting a hang of the maneuvering with his chainsaw. He's so faaaaast
---
Maybe if you're bad at nurse
---
Alright have fun!
---
That's fair haha
---
You too
---
If you play a game for a while it's not going to be scary 99% of the time, even if DBD is marketed as horror.
---
it really is tho like no /s
---

---
but I hope people keep sleeping on it otherwise I'll have to fight ppl for my chests
---
Yeah tunneling is very basically having tunnel vision on one person.
---
Because gamers are assholes.
---
alright but can I ask this
---
Can the emergency Medkit let you heal twice or just once
---
It looks like Tom &amp; Jerry
---
Because one would assume that 2 people on a generator would make it take 80 seconds. It still gets done faster, but doing two individual generators takes less than doing two generators together.
---
There are multiple things on both ends that make the game less fun, though typically it is weighted in favor of Killer due to the nature of the game.
---
Nah he commented because it’s a post filling up the subreddit. You can camp whoever you want, you don’t have to tell the whole world.
---
You don't really need to know because tier 3 Spirit Fury only makes you break 2 pallets. That, in combination with brutal strength and enduring is a good Anti-Looping build (+ something like bamboozle).
---
I DC’d cause I went from rank 1 to rank 10 and had a lag switching LF who I 100% know wasn’t a rank 1 before the reset. I’d rather have sweaty then cheaters 
---
“The Destroyer of Reality collection now available”
---
Not even half of Billy’s Chainsaw speed.
---
I’m actually very similar; followed the game since beta, picked it up recently, and enjoy Trapper the most. Make sure to leave 1 trap set in the killer shack, either right underneath the window or in the grass by one of the doors. A lot of times survivors will predict it, but if the trap is armed, they won’t be able to loop at the shack. If they do try to loop there, they’re screwed. It’s really not worth it to put traps underneath hooked survivors, but placing them hidden nearby is worth it sometimes. Predict which way they’ll try to flee to when they get unhooked, and trap it. When they do get off, try to drive them that way.
---
I Love a well rounded discusion, always feels so satisfying 
---
When your the worst Killer in DBD so you try to assert your dominance to *OVERLOAD*.
---
Oink my mans 
---
for survivors. 
---
It looked like he jumped up and clicked his heels together
---
I really don't feel it's enough, since you have to go out of your way and not to the objective while cleansing them.  
---
If it was 600 toward a category (specifically boldness), instead of just extra pocket change, then I'd certainly feel like it'd be more worth it.
---
the only thing i have a problem with is people with YT in their names that dc after getting downed because they can't use this game's footage for "sick spin montages"
---
Exactly hence the name
---
I got 80% of my DBD knowledge from memes
---
I always thought that you need to complete 2 gens to spawn the hatch. Regardless of how many survivors are currently alive - at least that's what I always experience.
---
Hey guys, is there where we meet up to complain about Legion? 
---
Boldness is the category specifically towards being near/chased by the killer. Which by adding them into that category makes it so you would never have to be chased and could double dip every game 
---
It does give 600 to boldness doesn't it?
---
Me, wait your talking about the game... hmmm yup still me
---
Nope. As of right now, it's 600 straight to your pocket.
---
even when everyone lives, there's something to complain about...
---
It’s a cash grab, cosmetics are apparently not raking in enough dough I’m guessing, they just hired 100+ developers awhile back as well.
---
It’s even more insulting that switch is getting announced before console optimization in spring ( switch port will most likely be released beginning summer/end of spring)
---
They have a couple AAA titles to compete against this summer as well and with the announcement of Gunbreaker for FFXIV will have a lot of older people playing FFXIV this summer for those that have been waiting for a eternity for a FF8 port to console or remaster 
---
What does cleansing do(when not a hex)
---
"Killers are underpowered"
---
....
---
Another day another BS killer mains said. Who gives a F about statistics, right? 
---
Ebony Mori is my FAVORITE Offering in the game!!! Earlier i ran the spirit add-ons- purple amulet &amp; purple sword ebony mori= full wipe with 33 generators left. Screw the Entity slow ass judgmental bloodweb eatin ass hole. We’re killers let’s KILL
---
yes I’m a killer main lol
---
had a feng min accuse me of speedhacking when i had to run around a truck 4 times to catch her...
---
Except this game crashes like crazy and that counts as a DC. Real DCs ruin games, but maybe they should fix the game before going around banning people for disconnects 
---
The thing should be a killer
---
Are you talking about shadowbringers the next FFXIV expansion? Cause I'm looking forward to that and I know quite a few more looking forward to it also
---
How the fuck is he a teen? He looks 40.
---
That's true. Idk why they'd put the effort in to port a game when they'd get more players just by having a functioning one lmao
---
Cleansing totems alerts the killer of your location once you're done. Or while you're doing it, if the killer's using Thrill of the Hunt.  
---
I'd argue that it's a bold move to cleanse them. Also, you'd have to be the one to cleanse all of them if you'd wish to get even close to an iridescent medal. It's not an easy medal to get so high, unless you're amazing at sneaking and/or juking.
---
If I had a broken leg and a sprained ankle, when the sprained ankle was healed I would still have a broken leg. Play high rank killer for awhile. I will gladly take solo queue survivor and day of the week.
---
I wasn't talking about kicking a Gen. I was talking about Survivors working on Gens. Obviously you'll go for the one with the most progress and it's the exact same logic behind tunneling. The person that has already been hooked is closer to death than the others.
---
Yeah, keep calling me an asshole and a shitty killer when it's your teammate that got you killed. Do you blame the killer for switching to you when your healthy teammate leads them over to you while you're injured as well? Is that tunneling? Are they supposed to just leave you be to do generators while you're injured because their teammate led them to you just because you say so? Are they shitty for switching to an easier target?
---
You being on a hook means you're not doing generators, and your teammates probably aren't either, looking to come unhook you. I don't owe you anything if one teammate is an asshole and farms you. You're not entitled to a free escape just because you got put in a shitty situation, take the loss and move on. Lost a good item or offering? You'll get more. For all I know, it's the farmer that popped the escape cake. That could be a brown toolbox with no addons. If you die quickly and didn't pop anything good, what's the fuss? 5k for a 3 minute game, or 25k for a 15 minute game? Yeah, a short game and a low score *feels* kind of shitty but you're breaking even, time to bloodpoints, with no real loss because you didn't bring an item and maybe popped a brown offering.
---
I'm not making up my own meaning.  If anything, it is you.  Many people seem to agree with me:

---
&gt;It seems as though you are almost unfamiliar with the entire meaning of the term, as you're only seeing the end result of successful tunneling.  
---
&gt;On the DbD forums and the Steam community both, there are several meanings to the term tunneling. However, the one aspect that is almost always agreed upon is that *tunneling* is when you chase one survivor and one survivor only, no matter the outcome of the chase, whether you kill them or not.  
---
&gt;That being said, if you choose to chase *one* survivor for the duration of the completion of 3 generators, you *did* tunnel that survivor for that amount of time, whether they escaped or not.  
---
&gt;Perhaps you should stop making assumptions about what the entire community at large thinks.

&gt;Our definition of tunneling comes from tunnel vision meaning that in your given circumstance you were indeed tunneled.

---
It does, though. I have had many killers beeline to my location after cleansing a dull totem. It's a good thing they rarely check lockers.
---
I am telling you 100%, it does not notify them.
---
I’ve owned and played on both. It’s exponentially better on the Pro.
---
Unfortunately nobody wrote anything. But I would have loved to hear their scream at the end.
---
Just dc lol
---
Lol
---
The port is scheduled for fall. How didn't you know that?
---
Yeah sure, I even brought y’all cookies
---
I'd say it depends on the situation but it does bug me when people bitch about tunneling when it's nothing more than a long chase.
---
If it doesn't, I find it mighty weird that they often come running straight for it after it's destroyed.
---
You clearly have no idea what you’re talking about.
---
But you have to buy them all to use them
---
Or her &gt;:(
---
Because the Nurse was a great idea.
---
Anything to add more characters that aren't fucking Link or Marth.
---
I understand you Dwight.
---
For the life of me I don't understand why his base movement speed isn't lowered like nurse or huntress. Can easily make ground to you just then chainsaws you in the face. Then goes across the map in 3 seconds to repeat it all over again.
---
Final smash is moonwalking with bloodhound 😂
---
I mean if you keep coming up with different combinations of words to explain how you are being an asshole, sure I guess I'll keep mentioning it.
---
Yes
---
Yes I'm playing on PC, and Playing legion is basically like saying "i'm gonna get an undeserved and free win" because 1-4 people DC as soon as you frenzy strike the first person. That is just so infuriatingly stupid, and entitled douche behavior. It makes me sad that I reached rank 1 because of it, and no one should feel bad about achieving rank 1.  At this point I envy the fact that you play on console.
---
It's still tunneling. If you're dumb enough to stay on one person that's your fault, but dont pretend it's still not a tunnel. 
---
Most likely just Freddy. I can’t think of any others that would need a rework 
---
Freddy first
---
Then legion 
---
its like 10 on ps4
---
Hitting survivors through pallets is easy as fuck, ruin is supposedly to be rng so everyone’s spawned in front of lit totems but they’re a lot more consistently hidden, even on 60 ping killers get hits it doesn’t look like the should have, and no infinite’s means looping is a lot harder. Killer isn’t hard to play at all right now
---
Freddy then legion
---
Right now Freddy is in the works, Legion comes afterwards and then Nurse, Billy and Leatherface.
---
Ngl looked like he wanted to farm. It’s either that or you are low ranked vs a low ranked killer.
---
Honestly think it boils down to people purposely doing stuff to boost a killer/survivor way up to those ranks and ofc itll take more than one group of people to do it but from the amount of survivors I've seen in red ranks from noob3 and tru some of them are truly boosted. Idk how easy itd be to boost a killer but survivor is easy enough honestly..
---
They need to just fix it so terror radius doesn’t go through floors, other than that the map will always suck bc if it’s design 
---
Even Thrill doesnt notify killers if you cleanse a regular totem which isnt attached to another hexperk. You might want to play some killer and see if you get notifications from totems yourself if you are unsure about that.
---
I don't have a problem healing. 
---
Frosty Eyes = NOED

If you have trouble finding p3 Claudette’s you need to go to an eye doctor. 
---
a brave console huntress, love u
---
wow cant believe they made the thing a killer this is so epic
---
He's level 13.  And so I was I.  Well, 9 but for some reason rank reset put me at 12 then after not playing for one day, set me to level 14.  I thought I'd only go down to level 10 after rank reset but I guess not.
---
its hard on both but works for both 
---
You get morid after only one hook
---
Just a tip for clown. When you down a survivor that has decisive, throw a bottle underneath him so that he gets slowed after using it. Combined with enduring, this can be a nasty combo 
---
I think we all agree there’s an inherent issue with Legion, it’s practically a meme so awareness has been raised, GG. That’s why we “entitled douche-bags” DC the instant we see the deep wounds status and I’d argue that mass dc’s are a far more likely to encourage action on the part of the developers than attempting to incite half the player base to adopt a broken killer that’s reviled by both. 
---
Realistically I think Legion will likely remain where he is for the foreseeable future. Were it a simple case of buffing his movement speed or nerfing his add-ons BHVR would have acted already as it took them barely a month to correct the issues that plagued The Spirit. What we need for Legion is a complete rework to the same degree that Freddy needs his and sadly that won’t occur anytime soon given that the studio clearly has other priorities and will no doubt soon have to focus their efforts on adjustments for the next killer. In the meantime all you can do is either persist in adding to the DC’s and frustration or else play another Killer. I recommend Hag. Hag’s bitchin’. 
---
What are the streamers doing specifically that you consider toxic? The examples you gave just seem like things that irritate you when you play. 
---
I trust you reported the user 
---
What perk/hex is this? :v
---
Lol, you totally got me. A meme is the ultimate in internet battles.
---
Like I said, survivors don't seem to go around lying to themselves about their own behavior.
---
Hell yeah I did. Right on the website. No one else should have to put up with this kind of fuckery, killer or survivor.
---
Looks like the raw materials for a locker.
---
You go to rank 10 if you were rank 1
---
Basically, you didn't go far away and you're still close enough to immediately redown the unhooked survivor. Close enough that you really might as well face camp.
---
I don’t heal against anyone unless another survivor heals me so I will gladly accept your wishes 
---
Because all killers should be as good as billy at base, why nerf the perfect level of balance? Buff the rest of the cast up to his level
---
Unless it’s clown
---
Hope my finger taste good
---
1. no its not easy to hit survivors through pallets
---
2. people dont spawn in front of totems a totem isnt a spawn point, there might be one there if ur lucky
---
3. infinites are an exploit, there shouldnt be a way for the killer to never catch u that shouldnt have been there in the first place
---
saying killers because infinites dont exist smh
---
I mean, if you guys let me get to tier 5 on my Devour Hope then I’ve earned the right to Mori you and you deserve to be Mori’d.

* 2 more dc*
---
Billy is swetty leatherface 
---
If you lost more than one survivor in a match where the killer tunneled and camped you're not a very good player, tbh. I can't afford to camp because gens get done, if I hook someone and all the other survivors come within sight of the hook i just have to assume they wanted to watch their friend die because I'm not going to leave if I know you're not working on gens.
---
This might be off topic but I've thought about this before:
---
Why would the reverse bear trap not kill someone escaping through the hatch? I understand the reason mechanically (to make them more fair to survivors) - but "lore" wise wouldn't it still just stay on the survivor's head and just go off in a few seconds anyway, or are the survivors just instantly brought back to the campfire with the trap removed? 
---
Only when its an ebony every 3rd game cuz youre in the red ranks. The rate of random DCs are so high, its like playing against an ivory mori every game anyways. Every now and then isn't so bad, especially cuz i know killers may have the rituals to do. I'd also say the dying light, mori combo is a bit cheap, but i dont face that enough to complain about it.
---
Legion: Disconnects the competition!
---
I’m saying killer is easy because I already hit rank 1 and got a 4K most games. 
---
Pallets are a joke and if you lunge into them the survivor will get hit if they don’t time it perfect, totems are def harder to find, and the point is looping has been nerfed. 
---
Literally everything about survivor has been nerfed and killers have gotten tons of buffs. If youre struggling as killer it’s because of personal skill not the games balance. 
---
Congratulations, both to you and him! Which one of those is your answer, if you don't mind me asking?
---
Their addons do and I just answered with what McLean stated is happening next in terms of reworks.
---
(Insert killer here) for smash!
---
Leatherface is already in Mortal Kombat, why not put him into smash too lmao.
---
If we were being serious though I feel that wraith or trapper would be better for Smash tho
---
It doesn't feel the same without the "ғʀᴏᴍ sᴜᴄᴄᴇss"
---
I play both killer and survivor. Up until recently I would get extremely pissed and have a full on debate with people if they messaged me. Ive since learned to shrug them off and felt like other people might benefit from the strategies I use.
---
That his butthole in the back on bottom left?
---
I’m not salty just saying it’s easier to win 2 chases and bam the dude is ded then it is to hit a really tiny skill check once a game where the killer might catch anyways
---
Tombstone’d by Myers and I couldn’t help but laugh at this animation
---
everything about this picture is so wrong
---
Downed two of them, moried one, then they disconnected :(
---
yeah I’ve noticed. everyone just hyper focuses on the toxicity and they suck the fun out of it for themselves 
---
Umm how did the hatch close, tell me your secrets master???
---
I doubt that as they have the same buttons so there’s no reason they can’t use the joycons. 
---
Despite how excited I am if this is pro controller only then I’m out. 
---
&gt;Huntress
---
I know bro, I wasn’t putting words in your mouth honest, just expressing an opinion,
---
For example, nurse add ons need a rework. Billy’s do not.
---
Leatherface needs add ons reworked
---
But they will probably nerf billy and nurse the only 2 killers viable at rank one. Then they’ll rework them again..... eventually.
---
Without the other there would be no game.
---
It's also a lot easier to win 4 chases as survivor than it is to win 2 as Killer when both players are equally skilled.
---
sorry about the delay, well, most people i see are really toxic, i mean, both ingame and outside, gangbanshing, humiliating people for no reason at all, saying that others are trash, and that they should kill themselves, i dont think these kind of behaviour should be trivialized
---
i prefer dcs to moris lmao. just means you outplayed them harder in my eyes. although i guess it ruined the satisfaction.
---
no, you got it all wrong, or maybe i didnt put enough info, sorry about that.
---

Territorial Imperative - Alerts killer when survivor are in basement 32 metres away

If the hatch opens with a key it’s only open for like 10 or 15 seconds 
---
yeah you fucking GOON
---
Every gaming community is toxic 
---
no, wrong
---
Hmm, I did not know that thx
---
yea but compared to other games dbd is pretty bad.
---
Ahhh I see now, I thought that was bloodhound
---
especially on console 
---
When someone open hatch with the key it stays open only for short period of time. 
---
I was so naïve...
---
Brand New Part is pretty shit now though
---
That's...not true.
---
its called padded traps
---
Now I understand where you are coming from. You are DEFENDING the right to DC when playing against Legion...Where'as I'm trying to get more Killers to play Legion in order to force all of those DC'ers to DEAL with them instead or get banned. The problem is that your option only shows BHVR that people aren't playing the new killer, but not why, where'as mine shows BHVR that no one wants to play against them and why. Refusing to play 1 killer because they are toxic to the community doesn't compare in anyway to the impact as choosing to play them despite the toxicity. I know it will be a hell of a lesson to the game, and the devs, but its a lesson that must be learned and in the only way that inspires action!  
---
Am I wrong to think the best way to fix an issue is to make the issue apparent to those who matter by hurting the consumers to the point that they badger the devs? Yeah its a douche thing to do, but what matters more? The devs do something to fix it, or the newest character gets punished for poor design?
---
You’re joking right? 
---
First of all, sorry for not putting too much information on the post, etc, the toxic behaviour i mean is not even the t bags or the silly things ingame, but more the gang bashing, and some horrible stuff you see at the post game chat, i know the community is not perfect, but someone calling others trash,bashing, and telling them to kill themselves OVER a video game match is something that should not be trivialized, i say this because as much as we are "good" and the others "suck" we never know what other people are going trough their lives at that moment in life.
---
No matter what you as killer you will get messages.  You 4K they call you trash.  They all survive they call you trash.  Just block them and move on.
---
Should have dribbled the obsession, the hook was close :c 
---
I play console and tried and failed tho get good at huntress, I'm happy for you though
---
So is R6 and DayZ, I mean I agree with you the whole dbd community is toxic. Especially on reddit and the steam boards 
---
Yea, I was told to eat sh*t quite a few times when I play as killer. Although I never got a killer salt message sent to me yet.
---
Why tho ;_;
---
Definitely not. I play lots of other games without toxic communities.
---
Usually they aren't pvp games.
---
no, i was not clear at the first post, and sorry about that, i made an  addendum
---
Fucking dweeb
---
Shocked chicken legs made it that high
---
Also thank you for posting the comments, love em all
---
Not even close to no.1 cause of the amount of effort compared to spirit, the frame drops that come with nurse make her mid tier at best
---
Yeah no I can still think of toxic communities that arent pvp 
---
"More FE characters? You got it." - Sakurai coming up with the next DLC.

Me and my gf play survivor I'm rank 10 shes 6 its been a while. We're constantly running into toxic people. A killer, survivor combo who messages me i suck. Anyone who wants the points for cleansing a empty totem. 
---
I actually get what you’re saying and agree with you. I think some people in this thread just didn’t understand at first and didn’t want to back down over something so silly. But yea, chasing is NOT the same as tunnelling, at all.
---
If it happens on regular platforms, imagine this game being on the Switch 😂😂
---
Pretty sure the lightburn was removed entirely, and he gets blinded instead though it takes less to blind him.
---
Awards more BP for trapping people and doesn't injure the trapped survivor 
---
I like the meta, harder characters should becrewarded for their skill. 
---
Feels bad man. 
---
Honestly this kind of shit has happened to every game since the Lunar event, I can't even play it anymore. Just upgraded my internet to be sure I'm not the problem, my ping has improved but I still pop into different places once per match. Those dedicated servers can't get here fast enough. 
---
Guess I've had a little better luck than you, are you on PS4? Maybe it's the platform.
---
Hope you get a GG soon! Makes me happy when I receive one.
---
It's going to be awful. A peer to peer*4 game on the switch? Switches have to be right up next to the router if on wifi(pls just get a cable) and judging by smash bros online, it's not exactly rare for people to not be doing this.
---
Yeah im on ps4 lol. I meet a lot of toxic people in most games i play 
---
Darn :/
---
Platform: Xbox One
---
Type of Bug: In Game
---
Description: Killers radius disappears when Tinkerer activates until the survivor is hit.
---
Steps to Reproduce: Unintended game advantage/Exploit. 
---
Expected Result: Killer comes over once the generator hits 85%, but their terror radius gives them away on approach, allowing the survivor to escape.
---
Actual Result: Generator hits 85%. The Killer (In 3 instances a Hillbilly and in one instance a Hag) runs over and comes out from behind the wall of a generator, surprising me with absolutely no terror radius, even during a chase until I am hit by them.
---
Reproduction Rate: I have had this happen 4 times now, and several people I play with have also stated that they have experienced this as being a problem last week.
---
I had a killer give me a backwards comment once. I was doing gens with this Kate as we were trying to get outta there as quick as possible; and then when he ended up killing me and Kate with NOED, he said “so Jake and Kate. how did not helping your teammates go?” and I just don’t understand what he meant by that considering gens are a huge help to the team. I guess everyone has to be an altruistic survivor or they’re a garbage teammate?????? I dunno man, I try not to let those comments ruin the game for me
---
The other day a killer said he hoped my male family members raped me and that I spent the rest of my life alone in a basement, so I really cherish the kind messages, lol. 
---
Dedicated servers are comming in summer, before the games release on switch. Plus I'm pretty sure mk8 and splatoon 2 are peer to peer and they're fine
---
This probably runs better than the actual game
---
I agree, but that hitbox is 100% working as the Developers intended. 
---
Same, but rarely it gets on my nerves. Although I would never approach or message a survivor out of toxicity.
---
I got camped by a rank 17 Myers and I tried to tell him not to camp and he said “u sound like a looser who lives in his moms basment”

Yes and have player names and recording to help prove it 
---
Still didn't hit me.
---
Ugh the doctor is the worst one to farm with when he just wants to keep shocking you. 
---
The way he misses and hits that lift around 15 seconds in had my c ry in g
---
That's an honest mistake and should be an exception to the rule.
---
Was this on console? You can report them to PSN if it’s PS4
---
Even though I understand that rank is generally more about time commitment than pure skill, but it took me almost an entire month of playing super hard (sit straight up, grit teeth, keep track of every loop potential). I got the Rank 1 killer on the last day before reset.
---
Following month, just dicking around as survivor and I hit Rank 1 in less than a week without really trying.
---
😂😂😂

Didn't make a mistake, didn't say otherwise. ltr

I’m so bad with my killers. I take BBQ, Ruin, Nurse and random 4th perk and call it a day.

Your right I'm not playing something that requires more effort and makes me nauseous because of the rapid frame drops

Thanks for the criticism:)
---
Wrong subreddit, but this still hits hard.
---
Might as well too, r/lostredditors
---
Important detail: were you injured before the trap caught you? 
---
Is it just me, or do the range add-ons pop up twice as frequently in the bloodweb as any other Freddy add-on?  I have so many green, yellow, and brown range add-ons I literally cannot use them faster than I accumulate them.
---
Anti skill check is F-C, but range is S?
---
Iv always thought the other way around. Make skill check RNG as bad as possible (still pure RNG anyway) to give better odds of lasting sleep and thus information, game stalling, and general annoyance. This alone is useful (if RNG allows it) as you can sleep someone and just fuck off to find someone else. If they fail a skill check, that's time lost. If they get woke up, you should see that and know where multiple people are. It should be a win win for Freddy.
---
Combine it with slower action speed or Class Photo and you have odds of making a game last AGES! Giving Freddy maybe enough time to go work.
---
Giving Freddy added range just feels like a worthless attachment. Outside of sniping someone in corn, you almost never need the added range from countless walls or objects blocking line of sight making more range a wasted slot.
---
You can usually tell the difference between MMs and DH. I think they're talking about the former. DH is an entirely different situation from MMs.
---
I wanted to include a convo I had with a r1nurse who brutally murdered us at r8. 
---
In the game we finished two gens before two of us got their third hook, then with just me and a Claudette vs this Nurse I tried to loop her and failed, during the loop I was going crazy because she was teleporting everywhere, she was a three blink nurse,I knew I was done at that point so I just crouched near a pallet and hoped she'd thought I ran but she found me because I was injured, I dropped the pallet stunning her but not without being downed first, I shook on the ground and she shook back at me, she then left found Claudette hooked her then went back to me using BBQ and Chillie hooked me and that was that. 
---
No one Disconnected which made the round more fun. I wrote the nurse "GG, pro nurse" she replied "Thank you"
---
Anna will always be top tier in my heart.
---

So weird, mine is slightly different.
---
The best add-ons for are the pill bottle, and the purple block.
---
They panic when they don’t know where you are. 
---
I also stack blocks to reduce dream transition.
---
To bad she has the mind of a 7 year old 😭😭
---
I know what the people want. ;)
---
hm, hopefully. its also really hard to believe the switch specs can compete with the current consoles, while even they are memed for performing mediocre at best (for dbd)
---
Misery Business by Paramore

Prayer beads spirit or any spirit junpscare in general 
---
Where did this perk come from though? I don’t remember it from the video 
---
I say this in the nicest way possible.  Please breathe through your nose.
---
Yeah the dedicated servers were an official announcement so that's good. And hopefully they follow up on the optimization update. Dbd could easily run on consoles at atleast a stable 30fps with actual optimization
---
goon.

What about the big lawsuit on who really owns Jason was that settled?
---
I'm terrible with any non stealth killer, Pig and Michael are the only ones I can play well, Huntress I try but she's so difficult for me.
---
My perks are usually built around that characters lore so Michael is strong and mysterious, and Pig is fast and tricky. 
---
with pig I use Unrelenting, BBQ and Chillie (for the points) Thrill of the hunt to make them think I'm using  NOED(I don't use NOED) and beast of prey for mind games.
---
With Michael I use; spies from the shadows, his perks(excluding Dying light) and Iron Grip
---
DS is the same but nothing ever happens 
---
I checked for my name in your screenshot because I had a match with a Huntress who camped on that hill next to basement last night.
---
Name doesn't check out.
---
Didnt thought you sound rude, hope I didnt either.
---
Billy and LF addons both needs rework in sense of tuning guide beeing atleast very rare since it does 5 addons of power in one. They both also get two ultra rare addons like the other killers already have.
---
I wouldnt say "viable at rank one" when the ranking system is just so easy that immersive players crouching all game and killers only facecamping their hooks can get to rank one without much of a problem. That makes every killer viable without beeing one of the top ones. I main billy since the early days where Nurse wasnt even out and like other players that invested a huge time in DbD have no problems staying at rank 1 with any killer.
---
Also, addon changes wont change the base power of a killer insanely, kinda like Wraith decloak/cloak have been shortened and reduced numbers on his addons in exchange for it. Just small adjustments that have to be made. And dont forget that killers like Nurse, Billy and Huntress are viable against good survivor at rank 1 without any addons.
---
McLean, they guy working on the upcoming killer and also on Freddys rework. Thats the one :)
---
Yeah, unfortunately underrated
---
Ba dum tish!
---
Wraith is #1 in my heart 
---
He made the unwinnable pendulum trap purely for revenge too.
---
I use to dribble but I'm tired of it so I do what monte does and just hope they miss which a lot of people do
---
This is why I use whispers makes it easier to find the last  survivor 
---
(Laughs in Nurse)
---
I'm garbage with Huntress and my addons were trash too. Everyone DCed after running in straight lines and getting downed with hatchets.
---
Thank God someone got the joke!
---
In the patch from the future where Freddy is top tier.
---
There's a special edition, but it came out when Doctor/Feng were a new thing.
---
The real reason he stays in the locker.
---
WOW
---
Can I just say how fucking proud of you for using ï instead if i 
---
I mean, you can't just instantly assume they were super triggered? Maybe they're good sports?
---
&gt; Expected Result: Killer comes over once the generator hits 85%, but their terror radius gives them away on approach 
---
wait, you expect them to have a terror radius when tinkerer activates? you DO know what tinkerer does right? have you read the description? 
---
Use botany knowledge with selfcare
---
I wasn’t trying to be rude. Idk how I’m supposed to get my tone out through text. It was genuinely a question. Shouldn’t make assumptions goof
---
yeah... its soooo funny for the 1000th time! a stupid bug can never get old!
---
This.  Even if you don't like farming, do you have enough fucking empathy to understand that people are trying to get some BP so they can get that one perk they've always wanted?
---
Yeah, I'm really sick of the game freezing. I get to play 2 out of 5 matches if I am lucky. Playing this game less and less every week. 
---
Sometimes killers tunnel one survivor the whole match and lose because of it. If you have progress on a gen that's all the way across the map and there's one right next to you, you should focus on the one next to you before working your way back to the other. As a killer, you have 4 survivors to stop. Focusing on one at a time is not nearly as effective as spreading out your attacks to multiple targets. 
---
Very proud of myself too! :D
---
Are you playing on Xbox or PS4? On Xbox, in the settings, you can make it to where only friends can message you. I don't know about PS4, but I'm sure they have something similar. 
---
actually i forgot they had that for xbox. bless your heart 
---
Not with the amount of times it has happened
---
That's true. I'm just wondering if people even like that aspect of it.
---
I mean that is nothing compared to in game
---
Nah, I’ve played as and against the buffed wraith and you can still light-burn him, but it just takes longer to do so. 
---
Isn't this game rated M for Mature? Pretty sure that means no miners....
---
ERRRRRRRRRRrRRrrrrr

I’m talking about the sub and the game as a whole. It’s the most toxic

Yooooo! Time to watch this!
---
That's where the fun begins
---
Yeah, the pig I talked to above was very friendly about me telling them about pig and distressing so that was a good convo.
---
Yes, and btw. Had a game today (rank 8 pc) with a lf that was hitting pallets and doing all the "farming motions" then proceeded to down us as a group and kill us...I got a safety pip, but still, it was a shitbag move. 
---
If they can’t even fix the console ports, what makes them think they can do a switch? Besides money.
---
I swear everytime i use bps as killer the game gets stuck on loading screen. 
---
The game's coming *after* dedicated servers... 
---
That’s not holding a game hostage. It’s a hatch stand off. You’re in the right if you did camp the hatch and they are in the right to hide and sneak doing a gen. 
---
Switch port is just gonna be the console ports post optimization patch
---
that killer is THICC
---
Neglecting? What the actual shite are you talking about?
---
Just had 3 matches in a row where the game lasted an additional 5 minutes as I went around the entire map looking for a Survivor just to find the hatch and see the twat teabagging on it. Dude what the fuck do you have to gain by wasting everyone's time so you can push the crouch button? Is your self-esteem really so low that you have to do a butt dance because you found an RNG object spawn that awards you with 2000 more bloodpoints?
---
Just so you know holding the game hostage is bannable.
---
Who is this witch you speak of 
---
I play Claudette only because i got lucky and have prem 3, empathy 3, self care 3 and lightweight/saboteur/small game 3. At level 44. My Kate doesnt so i end up going back to to Claudette. But i hate flashlights with a passion as i usually play killer. 
---
I got called either a good cunt gay cunt or gift certificate by some toxic laurie. All they said was gc after I said gg even though I was insulted. I like to think I'm a pretty good gift certificate too tbh.
---
I don’t see it as unoptimized on PC, I have a 750 ti with an 15-4460 and I get full 60fps on low settings. PS4 version also runs fine and never really drops below 30
---
I try to never do that no matter how tilted i get. I feel really bad when i go after the last survivor i hooked. Which is why i use make your choice sometimes.
---
Theyve been promising console optimization since sometime last year, and have yet to deliver on it. I doubt this will move the timetable up any. Also, its apparent that BHVR cares more about PC than they do console. 
---
Well survivor is fine. Even goes up to 60 in the tutorial and when near the edge of the map, weird that they would have the framerate unlocked
---
Tbh we need a character with a sword, havent seen one yet.
---
I love every single thing about this
---
I'm going to stream right now
---
To extend on what u/heyitswalmart said: there is a special edition(/ Digital Delux edition on Steam) and it comes with the soundtrack, an artbook, and some Payday 2 masks. ~~You also can't upgrade to the Special Edition which is really obnoxious for Payday 2 players, since you basically have to buy the Special Edition if you want the PD2 masks.~~
---
On Steam specifically there are also three "movie bundles" for the game that give you the game and a DLC for 20% off. I don't know if they are available for PS4 but the Halloween bundle comes with the Halloween DLC while the Saw big bundle comes with the SAW DLC and the first Saw movie. There's also the Jigsaw big bundle that supposedly comes with Jigsaw (the 2018 movie) along with DBD and SAW DLC, but the package doesn't have the movie when I checked on Steam. Also I'd generally not advise buying movies on Steam as my personal experience with Steam's movie player is that it's... poor.
---
I'm really confused why there isn't a Leatherface bundle or Nightmare on Elm Street bundle in a similar vein to the Halloween bundle, but "something something copyright" I guess. Managing the rights to these things is always a challenge which is probably why we don't have a "Dead by Daylight Complete Bundle" on Steam to buy the game + all its DLC at a reduced price. Several games on Steam like Killing Floor 1 and GTA have bundles you can buy that contain all the DLC: I really wish Dead by Daylight at least had a bundle of all the original unliscensed DLCs.
---
"Make people wake up instantly" Cat Block is C tier but "move at normal speed when you sleep someone" is S tier?

---
We had a billy who lag switched. And it was really bad. He then admitted to it on the end game chat. I reported him with the screenshots of his messages and the people told me inneed video proof. So he got away with it 
---
no
---
Makes sense for the tutorial because there's a lot less going on. I still have framerate drops at random intervals as survivor, just not as often as killer. I don't have a pro but games like God of War 4, Horizon Zero Dawn, And Red Dead run flawlessly so I know its an optimization issue. 
---
Just had a very nice hag when all but 2 of us dc’d.
---
That blink tho
---
oh please, I insist! Don't you know it's *rude* to refuse a *gift?* :)
---
I hate keys and instaheals much more than Moris. not because I'm killer main but solely because the full rewarding thing on survivor side is due to fail while killer basically still has to earn the kill, still has to catch and hook someone and then catch again. I do, however, dislike Mori as offering and only use it for daily(60k not gonna earn themselves). and I do think pink Mori ruins the game.
---
so anyhow, instaheals, pink Mori and keys should be removed imo. 
---
I know but still it's not them who did it it's the jerk who already DC'd, they're hurting their team more than you anyway
---
This guy as the killer and a coal mine map would be stellar
---
on the right hand side of the subreddit you can edit your flair
---
It would’ve hit your hand, with the way ping works. You moved at the last second but the server would’ve registered you as still there
---
I thought you were talking about the band American Football lmao
---
That’s a band? Wow I’m ootl
---
They aren’t super popular or anything, no worries :)
---
They are pretty good though! 
---
What is the actual quote?
---
"how about people who say they are not religious but are spiritual" 
---
Feels like busy work most of the time... No rewards other than bragging rights
---
I thought it was the survivors lying down like they committed group suicide or something
---
And still it will run like shit
---
It’s stupid that if PC players want *true Fullscreen, 1080p HD Graphics and Resolution* that we have to risk getting banned.
---
I edited my games file to play Fullscreen on my monitors native resolution (1920x1080) and **holy shit** the game looks WAAAAAAAAAAAY different. All the Textures and Models are HD, my frame rate doesn’t drop, and it makes finding hidden Claudette’s easier. 
---
**The risk, however,** is being automatically pinged by AntiCheat for modified files. Some people have told me “as long as you don’t edit major files, you won’t be banned!” While others have simply turned off V-Sync and had their entire account deleted/banned.
---
All I’m trying to do is make *your* game look nice. Why the hell we don’t have more Graphics/Video Options in 2019 baffles me. And they’re releasing the Game on Switch, while it barely runs on PS/Xbox.
---
I’ve taken a hiatus on the Game until these things are addressed and fixed. Also the toxicity. I don’t like playing Killer and being told to *kill myself* just because I brought a Mori/NOED. There’s trash talking, and then there’s *encouraging suicide and death threats.* We need a reliable Report System badly.

I had a disgusted look during the direct when it showed gameplay, it looks like something that would come out on xbox 360, Astral chains has beautiful graphics for a switch game. Behavior should at least update the engine at least.

Had someone glitch out of the map once and refuse to leave because I was "camping" 
---
If I see you sprinting through an open area towards a hooked survivor you had better believe I'm gonna intercept you and put you on a hook too 
---
Long story short, screw that guy 
---
Sorry for the late reply. Do you want to play now? Or is it too late?
---
Whaaaat I'd love to hook/cheese his ass. Go 9ers!

Ah I see you're using my wife. Nice choice

There’s no downvotes on this post

When people said there was a Roblox DBD Clone, I just figured they meant inspired by, not an actual clone.

Huh, TIL
---
The amount of time it robs away from the surviving team is DRASTIC.

"Instead of giving the survivor their 5k escape + 2k hatch bonus points, I'll just waste my own time and give them 5k escape points + 2.5k points for opening a gate and completing a gen"
---
I don't use the word "morid" for DH. That is "killing". To me, moris is a term specific to only the offering.
---
The sad thing is, you're not wrong 
---
I think I see whats going on here.

You're BIG SPIN pissed him off so much he slammed his knees against the bottom of his desk in frustration, jiggling his Ethernet cable in the process.

A perfectly acceptable response to getting spun by a Nea
---
I’m PS4 to. I’m a killer main and Iv got a lot of rage messages. And it’s one of my favorite things about it lol. How I am, it’s impossible to upset me let alone piss me off with texts. I have a smile on my face the whole time plus nobody has a mind that’s fucked up more than mine. I had a guys say “I got you ip address, im a super Chinese hacker. I make your toaster cold you my puss bitch” I was cry-laughing I was like oh ok space man do it lol 
---
We don't do that over here. (I do like your art :D)
---
While using the medkit on yourself or someone else, press the secondary action key (mine is spacebar). So basically, M2 for medkit then press space bar while pressing M2 to instaheal
---
They are unless they have calm spirit. But you can still know because it will give you points for intoxication 
---
The fact that you prioritize trap add-ons over crouch add-ons baffles me. Pig is sooooo much more powerful with crouch add-ons if you can mindgame, basically shutting down pallet loops.
---
I guess they recently reworked her crouch, so maybe things her different. But man, I recall Pig being at her scariest when they knew how to mindgame with combat straps. Everything else was pretty easy to beat.
---
I mean an updated one then even with the crossover characters. The one you’re talking about is only on PC
---
&gt; When a survivor is being camped and instead of doing gens the whole team crouches behind something trying to get the save until the person dies
---
I don't understand sometimes. I don't camp because it's fairly boring, and it means 32 gens are going to get done in 10 seconds. If you're going to try to save the hooked person, don't let me see you on my way back from the hook. If all three are going at once in a close group as I'm 1 second off hooking them, I can feel comfortable knowing that no gens are getting done, and one person is going to die. It's not a difficult concept.
---
Oh and an extra tip to make sure it works for you; remember, every time a survivor drops from your hand(by ds, wiggling or flashlights) the survivor falls to your left. So make sure that the clouds are to your left so that they get intoxicated 
---
object of obsession, no mither, self care and diversion
---
The Suggestion tag makes this
---
NOT A FAN lol what’s his power? It allows him to run a lil faster and hit survivors possibly multiple times ohh so they can down them real quick? Welll no it just adds to his frenzy damage gage which depleted over time. Oh so they just bleed out and go down? Well not exactly they can do a mend action to try to reset there gage. Oh but there’s a timer right and it they don’t complete the mend by the time it drains they go down wellll not exactly they can still mend when it’s drained until they miss a skill check. NO THANKS ima pick ANY of the others hit them twice and down them. 
---
S Q U A D E T T E
---
Dude they are almost the fucking same, except one gets their ass kicked by a piece of wood.
---
Yea, but believe it or not, I did actually play the main game! Quite a bit more than the tutorial actually! Surprising, I know!
---
Depending on the game stage and how altruistic the survivors are being, the mori could really be the difference between a kill or potentially getting decisive striked, flashlight stunned, or body blocked on the way to the hook. Some maps are especially bad for hook placement, so it is sometimes more likely than it sounds.
---
I modified most of my graphics files and I’m fine
---
I appreciate it :D!! (Legion deserves the best)
---
I'm guessing they're just not supposed to scream from intoxication for whatever reason because I've had games with people not using Calm spirit and I've used that trick and they just never ever scream when DS into my clouds.
---
Lithe, Dance With Me, Quick &amp; Quiet, and Lightweight
---
Some people declare being banned permanently for doing the same thing. I haven’t been “caught”, but I also haven’t played in maybe a month.
---
For PS4 use the Medkit and hit L1 at the same time
---
I’ve been playing on ps4 and Xbox one since it released on consoles and just picked it up on pc. After playing for a day I am never going back to consoles again as long as it’s 30fps. PC is so much better on ultra @60fps isn’t not even close for me. 
---
This is were every totem is placed on the map. Had it yesterday. And every totem was with a gen. So I did a gen and the totem afterwards three times. I almost felt bad for the killer xD
---
Balanced landing, sprint burst, dead hard and lithe
---
Nea will always be the real killer. 
---
Were* underpowered. They aren't unbearable to play anymore while also not being ezville (unless it's Legion). There is quite a bit of hitbox BS but I'll take this over the sabo meta I knew and when you would lose without brutal strength
---
I wouldn't count on these devs meeting that timeline at all
---
In order to get it you have to hide in a locker 100 times in a single game 
---
It really depends on the situation. If you got to do a few things, had a decent chase, then hooked, do a bit more, chase, mori... Okay. When you are found before even touching a gen thanks to an opportunistic chainsaw hit or just dumb luck from the killer, then when pulled off the killer instantly runs back and mori's you... That's so intensely frustrating, especially if you brought in decent items and offerings.  It's all a spectrum. I can really respect a mori sometimes, and find it utter bullshit others. Killer side, I can feel like a cunt using it, or feel it SOOOO satisfying. 
---
Ok real talk, a map like this that was made of floating islands taken from other maps and maybe connected by bridges or something would be so cool.
---
Link the video you muppet
---
That jack-o-lantern is whispering to me. 
---
They should be insta mori’d :P
---
I will say that Apex fixes a ton of problems I had with Fortnite;
---
- Gliders aren't a thing so it's a hot drop; no waiting for 10 seconds as you float down as an easy target. The closest thing you get is a respawn terminal, but even then the person sniping you out of the air has to have good aim in order to do it.
---
- If I die but my buddies are playing, they have 1:30 to grab my "cell phone". If they grab it and run to a respawn terminal, they can get me back in the game (albiet without loot if the fight went south and they had to run).
---
- There's some hyper mobility in the game, but it's only down hill.  This means that high ground is even more important than usual and the only way you can disengage is by actually having the high ground advantage.
---
- No building, so I don't have to contend with sniping someone from a city away only to have them shit out a wall and make Sniping pointless.
---
- Character abilities compliment the gunplay and if you're good with the guns you're set. Alternatively, if you're bad at gunplay, a well placed shield/healbot/smoke can drastically change the fight for your team.
---
My friends and I have never really gotten into the BR genre; I play for challenges in Fortnite, my brother loves PuBG, a friend of mine plays religiously, and the others just kind of only play whenever we force them to, but we've been playing more Apex than we have DBD recently.

NEW KILLER CONFIRMED: Dwight is the recipient of the T-Virus.
---
I have twice that amount of hours and I have yet to get Pebble D:

Better yet, it should just insta mori all teammates and dc the DS user from the game. Why do they deserve any points anyway
---
Yes, Nintendo. My favourite console.
---
That's me.
---
But the opposite.

I main Freddy. I suck with other killers.

I.... WHAT? lol no clue WTF ur talking about lol thought it might be some kinda pop culture so I googled it and NOTHING, GOGGLE has no clue what your talking about lol

Man I love this, mind if I use it as a wallpaper on my mobile?

I saved up 1 million bloodpoints to get iron will on Meg. Well guess what partner, 1 million bps later, no iron will on Meg. Not on anyonyone but Jake. Ty bloodweb for dark sense and deja vu and calm spirits.

Well... that’s the internet for you

What I like to do is just create the party by pushing the little PS button, and in the menu on the left that pops up going to Dead By Daylight and then currently playing with and it will show the names of who you’re in the game with (unless they are showing as offline) select send a message and the name and it will create the group. Then from my phone app I just go to that group to type the message fast. Sounds like a lot of steps but it’s really not once you know what you’re clicking.

It’s surprisingly worked on skilled Nurses, but not as frequently. It’s a structural disadvantage for the Killer.
---
Wario clown
---
~heavy breathing~
---
Aww, I love statistics though :(
---
That one in particular was actually easily the best and most extensive one published in a while even if it was personal, I haven't seen the official ones from the devs in years. And these were rank-independent and had Nurse's percentage below Wraith's (I think Trapper actually was highest there, but that was the trap under hooks exploit's merit...), while the 1000 games were actually in a high-rank range.
---
I'd wish you happy cake day, but this post is a huge yikes.
---
Yea sure encourage hatch stand-offs, fuck
---
Damn thats some good manga
---
Scarred Hand powerplays
---
I mean, what if that's the way they enjoy themselves?  It's all about you?
---
Killers who unjustly camp are the pits, but you need to check your entitlement for a hot second. They're not there to make sure you have a wonderful experience. 
---
While I agree with the sentiment that they suck balls, let's just leave it as a stern "Fuck you campers". 
---
Just helping my fellow survivors.
---
11 hooks and not 12.
---
The videos literally say things like "insert killer here" but I'm super toxic. 
---
Thanks
---
I feel this is kind of redundant. Agitation + Iron Grasp is the best at getting to the basement, and Devour Hope/Make Your Choice already discourage camping. Maybe something along these lines:
---
*Your fervent care and modification of the hooks found in the Basement has aroused the Entity's intrest. The Basement hook's aura is revealed to you at the start of the game. Survivors cannot see the auras of Survivors hooked in the basement, and unhooking a survivor from the basement takes 50%/75%/100% longer. Survivors unhooked from the basement are inflicted with Mangled for 15/25/35 seconds. When there is a Survivor on a Basement Hook, you move 1%/2%/3% faster.*
---
This would reinforce the Basement's functions as a hard place to unhook from. This would work well with camping, but the main focus is to make it near impossible for survivors to unhook while in a chase. Mangled works towards keeping the survivors in the Basement for as long as possible, and the movement speed boost is just to spread the effect beyond the basement.
---
Yeah, playing DBD on the go would be so awesome. Currently I only have the game on PS4 but I'm so addicted I wish I could take it everywhere. Even if lesser quality or whatever, as long as it's as playable as possible, I'd be thrilled.
---
&gt;I play on console btw if that’s of any consequene
---
Yes, I'm on PS4 and setting to the 100 makes juking, 360s and following the Killer during a chase much easier. It takes some time getting used to mouse sensitvity 100 but there is only advantage after you do.
---
Same here. Yesterday was pretty good (for me) the day before I got facecamped and tunneled. Also quite some dcs. 
---
Just got a 4k with him with no perks or add ons... 
---
Just gotta know how to play with him.
---
You've just gotten REALLY good Freddy's,  just cause he's the worst doesn't mean you can't play him well
---
The dbd clone on roblox is called “flee the facility” (source, younger siblings) it’s... interesting 
---
[removed]
---
Same problem with Ark, Hell in the game's files in ark the game is still called "shootergame.exe"
---
I agree with your last sentence but you included things that shouldn't be. Namely trapper add ons and keys.
---
I got to be honest I have heard some creative insults but shark n***** is a new one.
---
I'm under NDA not to talk about what I've *actually* played but I got to test [Spellbreak](http://playspellbreak.com) and it was a very interesting first experience. The game is great but it's a little too complicated for me honestly and I think a simpler Battle Royale might be more up to my speed.
---
I can’t get out of the potato league soon enough. 😩
---
Those people go so far down to hell they come back to life on the other side of the planet. They then get shot to death by a firing squad for being a zombie and are sent straight down to hell again.
---
The only downside for me is starting fresh. I have multiple prestiged characters, all perks unlocked, awesome cosmetics, but hey I guess I can maintain both lol. 
---
I'm enjoying Surveillance quite a bit on Huntress for similar reasons.
---
 Push and hold PS button &gt; from the Quick menu select Currently playing with and add them into a message group &gt; refresh the PS messages app and that's it.
---
It means you're probably doing like 20 yard circles around the hook while you're waiting for them to die lol.  
---
Happy to play a game that runs like crap...nothing like setting a low bar to motivate the developers to fix shit. I don't even play this game on PS4 anymore as I feel like a time traveler with the skipped frames. Either that or I have narcolepsy. 
---
I've noticed this too honestly, but also sometimes it's as smooth as butter, but mostly they're rather jerky instead of that smooth sweep that it should be. No idea what causes it unfortunately. 
---
Yes that's an argument against frequenting double bloodpoints.
---
just gotta get bad survivors tbh
---
The move-speed ones literally do nothing lol
---
Pea size brain
---
I sent a nice message to a killer for the first time (first time I've ever messaged a stranger on PS4) but the person was really dismissive/rude in response. So, I was bummed out and thinking I'd never message anyone again.
---
Later that night I was playing killer and an incredibly kind survivor messaged me. We had a nice conversation after that, totally brightened my mood.
---
It was the second time I received a nice message as a killer.
---
My only hatemail so far was when I was playing survivor and a fellow survivor raged when I didn't save him as he was being camped.
---
Random hate/weirdos don't bother me. 
---
But someone being mean when I reach out to them nicely is...uhhh a lot worse. I probably won't message  anyone again anytime soon.
---
Well it all depends on the playstyle. Gotta play a little bit more dirty and pull everyone in the dream world as much as possible. I avoid tunneling or camping as a preference. But if tunneling is implied it wouldnt matter how good the team is.
---
Never got under 3 kills with Freddy so far.
---
It's negligible but it does have an effect I think
---
That's why I stopped playing DBD so much. Because with the gen rush meta and the double bps it really limits your creativity as killer. Some people don't even bother to heal anymore
---
There is no bp economy. Players don't trade it, it doesn't go to some global bp deposit...what a lazy argument. They could try at least. 
---
No rewards no, but before they implement rewards they should make it harder to pip. It’s honestly way too easy

When he spends all that time finally stalking up to the t3 and you just jump into a locker when he's on you lol.  Feels bad Myers...
---
That and really it just helps folks out who are newer to the game or don't grind it out super hard.  
---
McLean said on stream that after Freddy, Nurse would get at least an add-on overhaul.
---
It's almost as if they want people to grind more and waste time...
---
Hag traps always get me cuz it's loud af when they get triggered
---
The other cool combo is the head from Hallowed Blight with the new torso
---
It's easy... But not a freebie either... As survivor you'll get those toxic teams
---
You can just stand still and let him keep shocking you until he gets all points in deviousness categoey
---
Dead by Roblox
---
Proxy Camping is where you hook a survivor and remain somewhere on the map. If you do that survivors will shit their diapers so hard.
---
&gt;Was it a P3 Myers in Thompson's House map ? Because I played against a lagswitching Myers too yesterday. He was camping his ruin totem by the way hahaha
---
Am I? For telling that guy that he made a mistake? 
---
It’s shitty games as survivor (teammates don’t know how to repair gens). It’s easy af games as killer
---
I think people just like to complain. He may be the weakest killer, but he is still very effective and deadly in capable hands.
---
Personally, I hate playing against him.
---
That’s what I like (and sometimes dislike) about ps4: no aftergame abuse. 
---
He has a face not even his mother loved
---
Wraithluigi
---
like 8
---
Dear god, that's wrong.
---
Unfortunately it's also fucking genius.
---
I dont understand why it's policy to protect sperg bogtrotters like that racist piece of shit. Does reddit support racism?
---
This infuriates me
---
That isn't holding the game hostage. I won't argue, you can't convince me otherwise, have a good one. 
---
Mori = Fun times.
---
I reported them - I don’t know if it will get anything done, but I did it anyway. It actually really scared me, it was very specific. 
---
Why 😂
---
It's freebie. It's nearly impossible to depip
---
I respect your list, but why do people care so much for the block addons? Why put in the resources to make Freddy an m1 killer and ignore the stalling part of his kit? I can see it being somewhat ok for the end game, sleeping people quickly to slow down the exit gates but that is still a difficult task by itself.
---
Sure this is true....if you are a bad player. Just because overcharge can wake someone up doesn't mean it's trash (it's not godly either, just a fun utility perk), just find a cocky player that knows you are using it, kick a gen and have them blow it up while they teabag. Do that twice and the game just got prolonged.
---
Actually I started playing because of the memes.
---
&gt;Killer is weak and needs noed
---
&gt;Noed is trash
---
I'll have both thanks
---
Maybe you can solve my curiosity on this matter. What makes you value blocks, the addons that turn Freddy into an m1 killer with no other power (until the end game approaches atleast), and not for example classroom photo, which gives aura reading and the ability to multi sleep with ease (it's also broken during the end game if you have any end game perks).
---
Got it! I just didn’t know you could get pulled up like that while you’re in the jumping animation. My friend was pissed lol I’ll tell him to get hit next time before jumping in.
---
"Don't you guys have Nintendoes?" - guy at the conference
---
That locker is spot on.
---
Finally some new Dwight cosmetics.
---
I have only been playing for two months, so I can't say I'm a veteran, but if you want to hear my opinion here it goes:
---
First of all, the thing I like the most about DbD is that both sides, survivors and killers, are not exactly enemies but rivals. That means that you don't want to humilliate the other side (in league of legends, for example, you want the other laner to go 0/20), you want a good match, and you get a good match when both sides do their job.
---
Now, these are my unspoken rules, and I'll try to follow them no matter what.
---
As survivor:
---
-Loop the killer as much as you want: use every pallet and every infinite you can find, but don't teabag. Seriously, there's no need to spam that button when mr rank 20 billy doesn't even know how to chainsaw.
---
-If you're the last survivor in the game, don't wait the killer at the exit gates to teabag him. You should only wait for him if you are going to allow him to hit/down you so he can get the points.
---
-don't use DS. Yeah, it's a useful perk and no one is going to ban you if you use that shit. Why shouldn't you then? Because you've player as a killer and you know how infuriating it is. Again, you don't need to be a jerk.
---
As a killer:
---
-Don't use NOED. Same mantra as the decisive strike. Don't be a jerk, please.
---
-Don't tunnel. You want to hook every guy in the match three times, but you don't want to hook the rank 20 dwight 3 times in a row. Hook him 2 if you need to, but slug him for the third and let someone recover him. Also, if someone comes to get the hit, allow him; chase the latter and allow the former to get healed.
---
-Don't facecamp. If you just hooked your first survivor of the game just go find another one. If someone unhooks past 5 seconds go for the unhooker, the other poor guy is being farmed, it's not his fault.
---
Now, there are exceptions to the rule, aren't there? Of course they're:
---
-The exit gates are opened and all four survivos are alive. One of them gets caught. You're not a charity org: you're free to tunnel and facecamp and everything you can think of. But don't use NOED. Don't do that, please.
---
-Teabagging survivors. Ok, that p3 claudette tried to loop you, failed miserably and even dared to spam control while you were blinded by her obnoxious flashlight. Feel free to facecamp her if you need, or just play mr Bubba, throw her in the basemant and wait insidiously.
---
-DS users: I wouldn't facecamp them but I'd say tunneling them is pretty decent. After all, they're bringing ds to the game, so they don't deserve the full respect other survivors might get.
---
Ok, guys, excuse for my grammar as I'm not a native english speaker. Now, feel free to comment what changes would you do to my unspoken rules, i'd love to see what the community thinks about that.
---
They confirmed that there will be no crossplay, unfortunately.
---
"I guess I'll be in the locker for the next minute if anyone needs me."
---
Thanks I hate it

---
If you think that 10% regression is negligible for  few seconds of interaction, then you clearly haven't played enough to learn the value of time in DBD, also just sit back and relax maybe? You don't need to have the best working perks to lead you to the top of the killer chain, people even still use Thana for crying out loud. Also if you have 3 people working on a gen then they are fucking up since that is poor time management, they will probably die in the end game.
---
Yes 
---
Xbox  ni[B][B]as
---
"Lmao report bb killer ez wallhacks ez ban lmao aduuud i have over 300 iq and nobody is better than me in this game so you hacking"
---
Did i mention that hacking is not yet a thing on consoles?
---
Trapper: traps exit gates 
---
gg
---
i had fun anyway so my time wasnt completely wasted 
---
My friend rage quit because he was tunnelling a no mother
---
No it isnt. Lag swiching makes you freeze for a high amount of time. That right there is bad connection with the host. If you had green ping, probably his internet is unstable.
---
My friend dc’d because he was getting tunnelled by the killer 
---
That is a very informative video, it's funny that Freddy has to put so much effort regardless of addons used to perform well, but that is why he is fun for me.
---
Yeah I don’t blame him tbh 
---
It only happened at that point. The whole game was fine 
---
I get this message: 
---
Couldn’t start the game
---
We’re sorry, we had a problem starting your game
---
Error code: 30005(CreativeService failed (1072))
---
Please help!!
---
Literally me.
---
I am that duck!
---
I had alot of claims of lagswitching on my account, when in reality it was just my unstable internet that caused lag on people.
---
Every asymmetrical game that launches is the exact same story. People hype it too much, “Finally DbD has competition” “DbD is dead when this arrives”.
---
Game generally flops on arrival or does well in its first week then dies down due to atrocious balance (broken OP Jason in F13) (Killers being ridiculously easy to bully and unfun to play in Last Year) or because they’re just downright boring and crappy (drawer searching simulator).
---
The game then dies faster than a victim in a Halloween movie as a few ‘fans’ (read bling fanboy in the case of F13) vouch it’s still a much better game and is doing ridiculously well with less than 1000 concurrent players and no Twitch streams existing. 
---
Freddy could kill me with those pecs, mein gut.
---
Lag switching isnt that simple you know? You have to disconnect your internet cable, that makes the whole movement freeze for the survivors, and after 5-10 seconds it goes back to normal with what the killer did while the survivors were frozen. 
---
It could also have been your internet... so there is alot of possible things here, either way... you shouldn't assume that's lagswitching.
---
Don’t know why you got downvoted, game performs alright on PC but on console it’s such a mess that all it takes is a Survivor you’re chasing to wiggle from side to side to knock the framerate entirely out of whack. 
---
I love it when Survivors and Killers do shit like that. Like yes Karen, we get it. You hate yourself.
---
That being said, shouldn't it be bannable if they did that for 5 Minutes? Like that is legit taking the Game Hostage.
---
There is an actual dbd clone called "bloodmoon aura" by a guy named CJ4 *on roblox*
---
I’ve never experienced bad internet where I’m from, my game froze for a second at the pallet then it froze at the hatch, if he was further away, I probably would have still been in that animation
---
Tbf it’s not much better for console 
---
Thats not keeping the game hostage, because you still can find him and end the game, even if its hard. Holding the game hostage is making the game impossible to end. Ex: A survivor uses an exploit to get ou of the reach of the killer, so the kiler can't possibly get the survivor. Also, did you expect him just to show up to you and lose the game? If i were him i would hide and try to do gens aswell.
---
SONIC ADVENTURE DX
---
The bill didn’t do gens he crouched around the map for 20 minutes doing totems and fuck looting chests. Didn’t touch a single gen
---
I already got it when i used a swamp map offering and a killer dc'ed.
---
It looks so much better on Xbox and PS4 than it does Switch though. Everything looks ugly as hell and too bright on the Switch version 
---
This is why I said it's a gimmick build or for a 3 gen strat. You are suppose to be removing pallets, landing hooks, or just being an annoying fuck all throughout the game and have that pay off later. Not a great build but it's a build none the less.
---
Better to try something new than to be stuck in the old. If I wanted to play pure meta I would, I did that and it got old. Fast. Much more fun to mix things up in my opinion and just toss everything at the wall to see what sticks.
---
People call Hangman's Trick bad. But it works well on Trapper or Hag to setup a minefield that you can reuse endlessly. No more need to constantly travel the map everywhere when you always have a hook in your chosen spots. Really works with Trapper and the Iridescent Stone. 
---
To be fair, and I'm not saying this is the case for all because I'm sure some do it out of spite, but I have noticed that multiple BPS often means toxic swf.
---
If you don't play for a while after reset you'll often see it there. Some noob3 looking toxic nea with purple flashlight and decisive tbagging at every pallet. Last second lobby switching. Either all 4 or toxic or one tries to bait you while the rest go hard on the gen rush. I gusss they want to make sure they have the gates open before they start messing about. You also get them exploting the ranking system.
---
I think they want to bully new killers and get as many points as possible.
---
If killers take multiple bps to mean that then I'm not surprised they disconnect.
---
I usually play toxic back. You should see the salt post game.
---
Why does that perk sound nice to me
---
It wasn’t their choice, the 2010 remake is the only Freddy that they can get and they tried to get the OG Freddy but were told no. In the devs words “that’s who Freddy is now”
---
I thought you were playing for fun, my bad. 
---
agreed, how the tuck is that holding the game hostage? You can find him and hit him to make him leave. Holding the game hostage would be the killer blocking basement stairs, the survivors can do nothing to move the killer and they are stuck down there forever. Just because a survivor waited for you and teabagged you on the hatch does not mean he’s taking the game hostage, it means he’s either a loser or some dude who wanted to rub it in your face. But what am I talking about, what do I know, proceed to downvote me
---
I try my heardest to not be toxic. I play mostly killer, and I enjoy map control in the sense that if there's a hook near 3 gens I can patrol, I rarely leave the area. It's just a strategy that has some good results, especially because chasing is definitely my weak point.
---
So this person adds me on steam just to tell me to go f myself and start playing the game properly. I promptly wrote her a long message explaining why her hook saves didn't go well, and that if her team were pressuring the map better, the camp would have never happened. She had a few more things to say, I answered to the best of my abilities.
---
I know I'm not a good player yet, but come on. Why be toxic like that? Whenever it happens, I either ignore the chat altogether or try to explain my actions. Call me naive, but I think that's the way to make the community better, slowly but surely.
---
You can’t win, because you can’t come up with a comeback that is worth anything
---
I'm ready. 
---
When you realize the person you're about to tombstone is your obsession
---
to be fair camping wouldnt work nearly as well if all survivors werent all trying to fk each other for points. The amount of times that people are being chased then go and unhook someone right in front of you. I mean going vs 3 survivors instead of 4 is a massive advantage and all those unsafe unhooks are playing straight into that.
---
I always like seeing "the following player has added you to a group" after a game lol
---
Ideal location for the exposed hex thingy dingy. I dont get whats the problem here...
---
I guess If I think about that, yeah that makes sense. Still annoying as hell to be so open like that. :/
---
Red Robin 
---
They're using Unreal Engine 4, which is a pretty good engine, they just aren't using it correctly.
---
Ya bad it smells 
---
The 🅱️
---
I’ve played it.
---
It doesn’t
---
You were playing with a bunch of scared queers 😂😂😂 &lt;3
---
Whats the point of this? I main wraith and really don't see how it could be any help even if camping.
---
Ok yeah. You are High Horsing Dead by Daylight now. Do me a favour and just fuck off now.
---
You don't like an opposite opinion of yours nice :D
---
For me, the most entertaining thing about this game is trying to beat a killer in a chase. Believe it or not I don't play survivor to hold M1 on a generator, hold M1 to heal, or hold M1 to break a totem.
---
Legion takes all the fun out of chases with his ability in the same way that a Nurse can. The only difference of course is that to do that with Nurse you need to spend a ton of time perfecting your blinks while with Legion you just need to buy the DLC.
---
Huntress for me, I just love yeeting those hatchets. Plus her humming is 💯
---
You’ll never know
---
Dwight was actually the thing all along
---
i'm the obsession in that game, i found the key in the basement :p but yeah we couldnt stop laughing when the claudette got the hatch shut on her. no salt from that game :)
---
IT'S NOT A PHASE MOM! I'LL ALWAYS WANT TO DRESS LIKE A PICASSO PAINTING
---
Oof so you're talking about dead by daylight also being toxic af and other points that somewhat irrelevant.
---
The game night be toxic but that's up to players playing it and if you're going to be rude and flame (which is toxic, if you didn't know) that's why people like you shouldn't be involved in videogames or the communities that come under it.
---
Game is way better than what's been out, has a good balance in the Legends. My only gripe is being forced into a 3 man squad on a game that requires information from or on your other players. I'd play a lot more if it were solo or duos.
---
I wouldn't say the horror genre was dead per se but the horror, objective, teamwork and multiplayer based genre was. Dbd did a great job at creating a community for that genre and made people more aware that that kind of game can be fun, specially horror. 
---
Imagine if a straight guy posted pictures of women in bikini and put faces of girl characters in the game, insta banned.
---
So what the fuck is this? And why do I need to see this in my feed?
---
Precisely Monto is what I don't want. What I'm looking for is normal Myers gameplay since I'm not gonna be using a Tombstone every game. I'll check those out see if they have what I'm looking for. Thanks.
---
Yeah I wasn't really counting the indie story based games like amnesia, outlast or even layers of fear which I guess is what most people would consider horror gamws
---
Welcome to reality.
---
One company does something cool so people buy their product.
---
Second company does something better and more enjoyable so people ditch their old shit that barley works and use the new big thing.
---
Haha, imagine dbd on 3/4g. We already get hit through windows, you'll be getting hit from the other side of the map. 
---
Survivors DC more then Killer, change my mind.
---
Switch is the only Console I own so yeah playing dbd in bed or on the toilet seems pretty damn cool. I play on PC normally and really have no issues with the game.
---
That is a great point, i won a 4k with that 1 gen nearly completed, 1 gen left to go before exits. 3 survivors left, they all gang banged that 1 gen repeatedly. I could cover 2 gens. I obviously couldnt leave the nearly completed one laone too long as i had a guy trying to bait me away. One of them started one of the gen at the other end of the map. That concerned me but for some reason he let it go and started doing the whole bait killer away while we 2 man this gen. That pretty much screwed them over. If 1 person stayed on the far away gen, THAT gen would have been the last one and i could only protect one of the 2
---
Oh okay.. I was gonna say “yeah you’re not meant to have self care.”. like you can use it anyway hahaha
---
They can't even fix the game on the platforms they have now. Wasting more time, resources, bug fixing, and QOL patches to port it over to the switch. 
---
This will be a disaster. And most likely the matchmaking changes/improvements will be indefinitely pushed back a few times because of this. 
---
i mean its a team game for survivors, and very few people can actually play as a team in ANY game. Thats what explains people unhooking in front of the killer, they get points AND they probably wont get hooked because its more valuable to rehook the other guy. Selfishness at its best. The whole tunneling thing is more of a survivor problem than a killer problem
---
Bloodhound tho
---
Dont even camp close, camp away so you can 3 hook the guy!
---
You have literally no idea what you're talking about. Nintendo doesnt participate in the console race for one, and people don't buy it because they want a bunch of games. They buy it because they know the games will be fun, unlike the myriad games that get released for PC/XBONE/PS4 that have little content and are a major disappointment.
---
Yes because listing a bunch of things Jason can do doesn't change that he got completely bullied by a group of counselors working together - ie, doing what they're meant to do. As a solo person yes, you are very vulnerable to Jason because he can instakill you, but with a single other person near you he can't use his grab at all which makes him considerably less threatening.
---
Why would they buff Jason if he was already OP? Not that the buff was a /good/ one, but clearly there was a consensus among the community that there was an imbalance there. 
---
Play for fun/meme. And your rank will eventually drop to the more casual players. Rank is more indicative of time played not skill, since red rank people play often you're more likely to run into common meta builds, better loopers with better pallet economy etc. 
---
You just used it though
---
hah got em
---
TrueTalent has a lot of videos where he just plays ordinary killer games without over the top add ons. Typically for Myers the best lower rarity add ons are ones that make your Evil Within tier up faster, and good perks are ones to help you in chases at loops, such as Enduring, Spirit Fury, or Bamboozle.
---
Ooooh, Expose Him!!!

U and I think alike my friend. When I started playing the game I played as a survivor and leveled Meg to level 35 before attempted playing as the killer.  When killers hook me and stayed close by keeping the other survivors from unhooking me i thought ‘yea that’s smart using me as bait. When a killer focused on me I thought it was supposed to be like that way. I never got the slightest bit upset. One night I do something that makes me fall in love with the game. I play as a killer. That’s all I play now, if I get a survivor Ritual i try to discard them hoping for a killer ritual. I’m not a killer main. I am a fucking killer! Like when I started playing survivor read the hell to win tutorial which tells me that in order for the killer to win they must sacrifice survivors by hooking them. So I chance the first survivor I see until I down &amp; hook them. The I patrol the hook area attacking any other survivors or try to time it right and just grab 1 while there unhooking there friend and when the hooked survivor is freed he’s my number 1 target. 3 hooks = sacrifice. It wasn’t Long at all when I got my first of many rage message. FUCKING FACE CAMPER..... WTF is this really happening. I was like wait wait wait let me break this down. This is a game that involves 4 survivors &amp; 1 killer in a match. Survivors need to fix generators to open the exit gate to win. And the killer has to sacrifice survivors to The entity by hooking via 2 different ways. Once hooked they have a timer or hooking them 3 times. That’s exactly how the game is played. So why is Deputy Dip Shit puffin up his chest at me for DOING MY JOB. I’m a killer it’s in my job description to be a evil sum bitch. I don’t stay right on the hook anymore because I get a lot more blood points going after the other survivors I always get 3 every game at least, 2 is very rare I also get 4 a lot but because of the trap door that I hate and wish they would get rid of it. Every time there’s only 2 survivors left and there’s more that 1 generator and I hook 1 of them they just let them die while they stand on top of the thing. And the whole killers are supposed to give the last survivor the trap door...????? WHAT LOL who’s giving these assholes the power to make these rules. I get messages all the time and it’s one of my favorite things about it lol I love fucking with people, there’s nothing they can say that will bother me 1 bit, &amp; my mind is WAY more fucked up than their minds lol. My friends say I’m the most vicious troll they’ve ever seen &amp; there right I’m cruel merciless basterd! But I NEVER EVER start shit. I’m a metal head and hate rap but this quote explains my trolling perfectly “ Don’t Start No Shit Won’t Be No Shit-some stupid guy Jesus sorry for the novel sized reply but I needed a good rant to start the day
---
Yep I know some bullshit is gonna ensue when I see that lol!
---
When i play swf with my friend, i cant get into a lobby, it just says disconnected from host, and when i host the swf lobby he gets stuck, wtf is wrong with this game,  its been like this 2 days and i really wanna play swf
---
I got called a toxic runner from a clown because I looped a double window set up and he kept mindgaming himself it was beautiful
---
if you use a battery and a low amp on a flashlight, then it’s better to have the battery equipped first. that way the flashlight + battery get increased instead of just the flashlight getting increased and the regular battery being added
---
I made my profile private for this reason!  Now I know someone is salty when they have to send me a friend request to insult me! 
---
I don't know... If we're being really shallow here, he has the best body. We don't actually know what he looks like under the mask but the man is a unit. That's probably why he won and where the meme comes from in the first place.
---
I'll check his Myers videos out, thanks for the suggestion. Yeah, that's what I thought. I've never seen anyone use the aura or obsession ones. I always want to do the Enduring+Spirit Fury combo, but my build right now is Ruin, BBQ (just for the BP, don't have much time to play and the grind is painful) and the M&amp;A+Nurses Calling combo. I'd drop Ruin for either Enduring but the combo would be incomplete.
---
He usually runs enduring, spirit fury, bamboozle and hex ruin on Myers.  Lately he has been running discordance  on all the killers though.  I wanna say he dropped bamboozle for discordance.  Once I saw him run unrelenting instead of bamboozle. 
---
It’s good because being able to slightly counter pallets and windows makes his chase game really good with his insta down primed and ready. 
---
I really like using monitor and Abuse and dead rabbit.  Makes you harder to hear coming in tier 2 for when your not in tier 3 evil. 
---
LOL
---
I’m a killer main, but nice try. The old he’s a swf main. I’m not a survivor main. I never tunnel, and I regularly 3k I’d 4k if i slugged but I really don’t care that much. Month only tunnels because they fucking unhook right by him most the time. He doesn’t need to, he more than likely does it for the video and I’ve also seem him completely ignore the person off hook in plenty of videos.
---
Again, if you NEED to tunnel, youve fucked up. But atleast we all know that you’re a shit tunneller too. I bet you hook “patrol” too. Hey? 
---
....ok
---
So the Ancestor's manor from Darkest Dungeon?
---
But why? Fix current issues with hitboxes, lagswitching etc. The game itself is absolutely amazing, overglorified hide and seek that is really fun, but nothing ruins the fun for me as glitches in the game that are way more important to fix than converting game onto other platforms
---
Me and my bf actually watched the 1978 Halloween movie this weekend because of the game. Had tons of fun &lt;3
---
When I started to play she was my favorite to play against (I like playing her as well). The lullaby is so sad and creepy, I actually felt inside a horror movie.
---
P3 is like when your prestige your character 3 times to the make. 
---
Put a hot copper wire on his blood sample and see what happens.
---
Nope survivors don't do that either so whatever
---
&gt;’ve never experienced bad internet where I’m from, my game froze for a second at the pallet then it froze at the hatch, if he was further away, I probably would have still been in that animation
---
Well good luck anyway, i still think it isn't lag switching, but if you want to report i can't stop you. I just hope that guy doasn't end getting banned if he did nothing wrong.
---
It also wouldn't be hard to find his IP and other  things tho..
---
Exactly the same right here! 
---
The simplicity of DBD plus the fact that it is still hard to master is what makes the game good.
---
Well now I just feel stupid and idk but he was terrible at the game that's for sure
---
Very easy, you lack the skill to take someone in two hits so you need to go for the easy target because you are not a good killer. Proably shit and checking gens because it’s hook tunnel rinse and repeat then cry about gen rushing. Tunnellers are trash. And please don’t think I’m a survivor main like the person who replied. I’m a killer main. If you need to tunnel you are bad but most killers act like killer is so so hard when it’s never been easier as of now.
---
Still my point stands, it isn't keeping the game hostage. Because you could have found him in 2 minutes and ended the game there. If i follow your logic if a killer with 5 gens remaining refused to kill the last guy, it would be considered keeping the game hostage.
---
This. This is a quality shitpost.
---
i feel the same lol. luckily i never had a moonwalking legion so far. i'd rather face legion than hag or trapper. personal preference i guess
---
A couple weeks ago, a couple of coworkers and I were discussing the same thing; we all used to play a ton of Roblox as kids.
---
We all ended up downloading it after work and played tons of classic games together. It was a great nostalgia trip and was lots of fun.
---
That wasn't very country roads of you
---
I’m grossed out looking at the Spirits dirty butt crack and she also looks like a 13 yr old girl so nothing is even remotely attractive about that to me. 
---
lol its hella easy to pip as survivor wtf i reach rank 1 within a few days after rank reset most of the time
---
Why the hate on slugging and tryhards though I consider myself a try hard but being a try hard doesn't make you toxic it's how you go about trying to win also slugging if anything is a viable and non toxic strategy because if you play smart as survivors you can loop the killer around as you pick up your down teammates and just don't stay so packed together a lot of times I use slugging not because I want to it only works in certain situations but I use it because I go up against a group that won't leave each other sides so instead of picking the people up it's quicker to just down all of them and then start hooking them. It's pretty simple if I start slugging just go do gens wait for me to start hooking don't stick around and get slugged next
---
It must've been a very sad person. The salt would be funny if it they weren't so pathetic.
---
He was an asshole because he didn't want to farm?  Or was it the way he said it? 
---
I saw his Spirit with Discordance and Surveillance and it was insane. I don't think it would justify a perk slot in Myers though, since mobility is not his thing.
---
Once I get the grind down to a comfortable spot I'll drop BBQ for one of those perks. I would happily drop  Ruin but the last two weeks I just face Voicecom SWF, most of them Premade and a big chunk with the x3 Toolbox/Flashlight save + x2 Prove Thyself builds.
---
If I didn't give a shit I'd run Enduring, Spirit Fury, M&amp;A and Nurses Calling with Dead Rabbit and an addon that increases stalk speed.

Don't you mean post optimization pass?

Awareness or luck? 
---
Good job though. 
---
I mean the char which can teleport herself when survivors run into her traps. It's "die Hexe" on german and "Hexe" means witch.
---
did you dc as well? honestly would not blame you 
---
So I 3k'ed the team and the last one ran to the hatch and I caught up to them and I had not used my tombstone at all yet. They thought they was gonna sit there...so I leveled up Evil Within that was almost to III and then I grabbed their neck and killed them. LOL, they totally didnt expect it. It was hilarious!
---
Even the buff is invisible
---
would like if you didnt teabag
---
Luck for OP and a lack of awareness for the survivor. 
---
sad
---
Yeah, Switch specs aren’t GREAT.  It’s definitely not a console you’d get if you want 4K displays and amazing graphics.  However I think it would do fine if ported properly.  I’ve never struggled with lag on wi-fi, and any p2p games I’ve played in switch manage to run well.  I just see graphics just needing to be potato in some aspects.
---
I don't see how this is really possible if you have 600 hours. I'm at 500 hours and have a p3 survivor with every single perk in the game unlocked, two p0 survivors with every single perk unlocked, and one p1 killer with every single perk unlocked.
---
I also have every killer and survivor at level 40+. I play only survivor, and I'm not really amazing or anything so it's not like I'm getting 30k points a game. 
---
Like is this hyperbole?
---
I think just lack of awareness on her part, haha. I was expecting to vault the window and keep chasing. I didn't even know that grab animation was possible until that!
---
Definite lack of awareness from the Claudette for sure. 
---
I don't know how to post video on here but I had this exact same thing happen to me. 5 gens we're done, 3 people hooked and dead, then suddenly I'm lagging all over the place. Then this happened
---

The low preset is literally missing lighting and shadows you braindead moron. It's what a "low end" config/mod would look like. Take your comment and shove it up your ass. The game looks horrible, runs horrible and feels horrible to play. Take your outdated 750 ti and shove it up your ass too.
---
Both? I mean the game is grind fest already (even more for new players) if you get a chance to farm just take it
---
Its nice how much thought you have put into it but some of those perks are crazy op. Especially the survivor ones
---
On what platform? I would have to check again see if they did anything but I'm pretty sure they wouldn't remove it from the store intentionally. 
---
OoooooooOooooo
---
D A R N
---
Sound makes it better imo
---
It's true, White Noise 2 has a lot of potential and the matches are more interesting for everyone because there's less toxicity, since you all talk in the lobby beforehand &amp; pick who plays what beforehand, and players don't have to leave the game when they die.
---
Definitely not a bad build.   I think surveillance is super good on stealth killers.  Spirit needs the prayer beads for it to be really good.  I’ve used it on Pig with her ambush to great affect. 
---
I mean it’s horrible doing gens and having to snap out of it because they want to keep shocking. 
---
Good job! I still don't understand the blinks at all. 
---
Is that a wraith?
---
Not bad wee video but the thumbnail is kinda inaccurate to be fair.
---
Like they don't post pin up fanarts or screens of asses of women characters from DBD. Did you just come to this sub or what?
---
literally just happend to me
---
Only catch is it has to be automatic detection otherwise people would flood it with fake reports anytime someone doesn't play to their made up rules
---
*at all times. 
---
It was worth it for the laugh but guess i'm going to hell now
---
HER MORI GAVE ME THE FUCKING CHILLS THE FIRST TIME I USED IT IT'S PERFECT
---
You dropped another one
---
Wow, okay but what do you think when you actually get a message saying good game?
---
I know, bond is better right?! XD
---
For each prestige you get bloody cosmetic. Weapon Head and Body.
---
Eh, I wouldn't let a couple jerkos stop me from messaging people, sure it's ridiculous how someone would be rude to you for being nice you them but I'm sure there is just as many friendly players as rude players, it's just the friendly players don't speak as much as the rude players.
---
It kind of depends on what normal is.  Those who play don't light and tunnel...I don't mind.  But if BPS have been played, and you find out after that the obs played one of them?  That's pretty shitty.
---
When you noed and the survivors removel all dulls then it DOES slow down the game quite a lot.
---
There are limited perks in the game and dark sense 3, calm spirit, and deja Vu will go away, BUT YOU HAVE TO PICK ONE EACH TIME.  I try to aim for the perk that is highest tier (1-3) so that it will disappear from my BW.  Honestly I have 300 hours (though part of this was the double BP Christmas event) and there are two ace perks I haven't unlocked on the survivor side: that's all.  That being said, I don't have all teachables unlocked on every character, just on my main.
---
I'd get it if I could link my PC and Switch progress or something, I don't feel like buying and grinding everything again.
---
If they don't, you slowed the game by 0, and are granted with 1 free chase and one hook.
---
Others can simply leave.
---
As Richard said mate. Its annoying and a pain in the ass, but its not holding the game hostage. If you waited long enough he would have HAD to do a gen, as birds would start going after him. If that situation bothers you so much, run whispers. Holding the game hostage is forcing a situation where one side cannot do anything and MUST DC to end the match, such as standing at the basement stairs and bodyblocking survivors but not hitting them. 
---
If i had money i would give you platinum and gold. Amazing post, your commentary is also amazing 
---
Jesus Christ. The amount of posts that say this exact same thing is mind boggling. I like how you people just read the “remove legion” parts of people’s posts and don’t even bother reading WHY they say to remove legion from the game. Honestly? I’m not even going to explain it to you. Nobody wants to type an entire fucking essay as to why this killer is bad for the game. I guarantee you if you just look around the sub and READ you will find out why people hate legion. You obviously have no idea why people despise legion, as you don’t even address moonwalking or frank’s mixtape. Watch damnnohtml’s videos, one of them explains exactly why legion is unhealthy for the game. 
---
I believe that "cellphone" is called a banner
---
What does leatherface has to do with this meme?
---
Hag, Peppa Pig and Legion!
---
They get drained because people get bored of them or they arent very good. Not just because dbd exsists
---
Freddy is really good for mid to low rank survivors who dont have the experience with him. High rank survivors will jus run and loop his ass for days
---
But it's still a dick move.
---
My fun &gt; other people's fun. Legion isn't fucking fun. HAddonfield's not fun. Don't blame people who DC blame the devs for making cancer game mechanics
---
If he’s touching your ass with the chainsaw and he’s nearly done charging it you can’t juke it if the billy is competent. Your best hope is to run around a tree or something and hope he sucks.  
---
Glad someone understands. You don't know the killer has NOED, you have no way of knowing. Its possible that those totems your cleansing is literally just a waste of time, as maybe they don't have NOED, and going around and getting 5 totems that, unless running Small game, can be REALLY hard to find on some maps, is just meaning that you're not working on Gens. Its a silly "counter" to a perk that effects the game by just existing. NOED may be in play, thus you have to do this super time consuming thing EVERY GAME to avoid being effected by this bullshit perk. Yes, seems fair. Tis silly.
---
Well, look at his name. 
---
It wasn't me
---
Exactly, and I also do it because I want to be able to use Random Perk Wheels. Sure when entertainers do it is por entertainment and fun purposes, but doing that forces you to get out of your comfort zone and you end up knowing more about the killers and about the perks first hand. I find it's a very interesting way of improving. You may find good combos that work for you, who knows.
---
Nice, good luck!
---
I think he is referring to a nearby survivor tapping it to stop the regression. 
---
So I played a game yesterday. Three people had flashlights, I pulled out my nurse. Finally, game loads and I find the meg. She just clicks her flashlight at me, and wants to die. Then I notice there's only two players. We fuck around, and I let them escape.
---
Next game, 3 people connect. One of them was the equivalent of a sack of potatoes, and I just didn't have the patience to wait out another generator simulator without gameplay. Seriously, back to back games with DC's is just unfun for everyone, killer included
---
Love doing this. It's like a slap in the face
---
Thanks!
---
"douchebag sluggers"  
---
Sheesh, sorry for trying to play smart to get a 4k, forgot i must follow the made up rules again...
---
To me, they just look mildly annoyed.
---
'Seriously Jim? You had to light yourself on fire again?'
---
David looking at Claudette
---
I love the art style!
---
You’re probably the same killer that cries about decisive strike, flashlights, gen rushing etc. Killers gotta do whatever they can to win but not survivors, survivors must go to the basement at the start of the game to be killed
---
who hurt you?
---
When you bring any late game perks but never get to use them since you killed everyone early
---
Hmm layers of fear?
---
Lmao , let's say it was not voluntary
---
You could do that SCP that is essentially a weeping angel
---
Dbd is not having a negative impact of the gaming company. First off, it's like battle royale. If people make games that are similar to eachother but have some differences to it with the overall goal being similar (kind of like every battle royale ever), Dbd did it right. It is the example of what a good game in this newish category should be, so people compare it because it is better in this category.
---
Also white noise online isnt like dbd. It's more like slender but multiplayer and you should know that if you actually played it, white noise 2 is like dbd (and that game is mostly dead. It's a good game dont get me wrong, but unless it snowballs now, games will remain somewhat difficult to find that hurts the experience).
---
This type of game gets repetitive, any game gets repetitive, but the fact that it's somewhat repetitive is why people like it. People like it's formula, how the game plays out, etc.
---
This game is actually kind of the opposite of rushed. While it may have glitches , balances and changes have been made to make the experience more balanced, and many believe this is the most balanced the game has ever been. People give the devs a lot of crap but you can tell they are trying with this game, the gameplay is mostly solid. There are changes that are going to be made in the future, too. The devs plan to support this game for a long time, and judging by the way things are going now, dbd will most likely remain to be the best experience in this category of 1vX type of games. If it was rushed and money was their only goal, they could definitely milk it. But it's arguably has gotten more consumer friendly with time, you can buy unlicensed dlc without real money with 2.0, the skin store wasn't added as a cash grab, it was added because lots of people requested it.
---
Also listing out objectives of the game does not show how the objectives actually play out. While more objectives sound nice, it's not always better. Take Friday for example. As far as I'm aware, that game never beat dead by daylight in player count ever, and it's kind of a corpse at this very moment. Deceit is a good game, it's quite different when compared to dbd, and it's even free to play. Now I don't know why it doesn't have as many players as dbd, but dbd can't be as bad as you're claiming it is if it beats a free to play game of the same general type. Last year's main problem is that it isnt on the steam store (yet) and that there is nothing to work for. I don't think last year will beat dbd in terms of average players and sales, but it is the best current contender. Never played Daemonical, can't say anything about it. White noise online is basically slender online, not comparable. And I think white noise 2 suffered hard from not making a mark. I didn't even know there was a white noise 2 for the longest time. 
---
Dbd actually promotes team play, there's a whole category where you won't earn points in if you don't help your teammates. You lose out on the possibility 8000 points for not helping teammates. I think some things hurt team play like the hatch mechanic, but your average game promotes team play.
---
Also wasn't your whole argument about how dbd doesnt have many objectives, and then you literally just said more doesnt mean better? Numbers dont lie. If people find a better game then dbd in this category of games, they'll play that instead. It has a bigger player base because it's generally considered better. People speak with their wallets. Also dbd has toxicity because it has became so large, you don't see that with most other games of this type because they're too small. And it isnt as toxic as people say it is, there are other games that have a way worse community.
---
If dbd didn't exist, the other games may have a bit larger player bases, but many people wouldn't have even been introduced into the 1vx category until Friday came out (which still probably wouldn't have lasted long). It's called competition, and it's actually very healthy.
---
I like Wraith. I always go towards the stealth characters or classes in games. Maybe I've just learned to deal with it, or that I was only a Rank 13 killer last season
---
Still happens to me with pigtail meg,sometimes.
---
I'm pretty sure the only way taking the Game Hostage would be bannable would be if you block someone from moving for like 20+ minutes which only a killer can do. 
---
Teabagging at a gate or hatch while annoying isn't taking the game hostage since you can just chase them out.
---
Bro I would get downvoted into oblivion for saying this, thank you for saying what needs to be said
---
The Bee-Bombs could also make the survivor slower. I'd actually spend all of my shards on this.
---
you handled that really well! frankly, the only way to counter toxicity, is to respond in a non-toxic way. this makes it so the situation isn’t escalated and there’ll be less fights between players.
---
They cant make proper matchmaking and you think we will ever get cross platform? 
---
Missed a really obvious one aswell
---
Read the post again, I said keeping your progress (characters, BPs, perks)
---
If you're talking about wraith, I didnt forget. It's already been done
---
no I mean like let them max out their deviousness and after that you can snap out of it and work on gens
---
I had that glitch happen to me but with all my skins disappearing I just went off for a few hours and it fixed itself. It happened right after I bought some auric cells so I think that somehow caused it 
---
You're getting points as long as they're in the area of it. It doesn't matter what tier survivors have
---
Tunneling is kind of toxic. It's good for the killer because it progresses his objective, but it sucks the fun out for the survivor, because freshly getting off of just sitting on a hook then immediately being chased and put back on that hook where you won't be able to do anything again isnt fun. It's not healthy for both sides, it's generally toxic. A killer who is good doesnt need to tunnel. Also stumbling across a survivor who got off the hook on accident because they can't hide well isnt tunneling. Tunneling is more going out of your way to get someone, if you're ignoring survivors getting in your way by body blocking you just to go for the injured who just got off the hook survivor, you're tunneling, and you're probably making them have a shitty experience. This doesn't really count when the exit gates are powered, much like camping is justified when they're powered too because it's your only objective.
---
Bangalore is life, so nah bro
---
Hes not OP, just broken. I think where we are today, people think those are the same. 
---
Ah, okay. I thought five minutes would be enough but I suppose you're right. It's still annoying though I really wish the Game could just have some sort of time out for that otl
---
Is someone that desperate for attention that they found an randomly spawning object first and has to shove it in the killers' face?Just fucking jump in and let the killer join a different match already
---
Any killer would be stunned just looking at her. She was told to survive, and that's what she's going to do.
---
Super satisfying when you know they think they are hot shit running circles around you. Then POW! 
---
Like the effort. Funny aswell, UP!
---
If her ability didn't literally paint me a trail to your location I would agree with you. And literally everyone has a better ult than her, unless you're on a coordinated swat team.

Likewise pal

I dont get people. I was killer just now and whenever i hooked someone their teammates would run in and save them literally a second later. I got yelled at for camping in the post game lobby. What am i supposed to do? Ignore the 2 people directly next to me?

Mini Legion!

I agree. I kinda liked the ideas the some BR games were doing, but never liked them as a whole. But Apex actually feels more fluid. My biggest thing i hated about BR games was the long stints of running around non-stop. Apex fixes that by making Running Fun.

Sometimes it's hard when a furious SWF group starts flaming the hell out of you in post game chat, but that's why I only stay for too long in the chat if people are being friendly. I don't respond flaming in chat. If someone adds me in order to be toxic then I just assume their problem is worse and try to help a bit.
---
They can
---
Not

r/dontdeadopeninside it took me like 30sek to find the start of this xD and the direction. But to my defences I woke up 2min ago!

Can someone explain?

"Hwat's this? A 4 man swf constantly hiding in lockers and holding the game hostage? My briefcase full of *bees* ought to put a stop to that!"

CHeck your e-mail, as I do believe the NDA got lifted.
---
I believe that the community nickname for banners is Cellphone.
---
Did him dirty 
---
ye, its not. Thats why there isnt anything bad about it. 
---
If everyone would do that, there would be way more People complaining, so there are alot of People who dont do it
---
I bet your cool s looks better than this tbh LOL
---
There's a character/legend in the game called Bloodhound. The perk in DBD is called bloodhound.
---
Cross platform is a wet dream right now.
---
But connecting players is a very good goal.
---
This could be a start, but I hate the Epic Games Account System.
---
I've never had an issue with that on PS4 Pro or Xbox One X. Are you playing on base hardware? 
---
Thank you! :D
---
We need more high quality DbD meme edits.
---
I will blame people who state “if it’s not exactly how I think it should be, I’ll be as inconsiderate as I want regardless of how it effects others.” That’s a selfish &amp; immature way to behave. Quitting from a game because it’s not the type of map you want to play is juvenile &amp; conceited. 
---
What? Looping is an intended game mechanic, otherwise they would’ve removed looping long ago. Nobody cares about legion’s placement on the tier list, what DOES matter is that he is agreed to be the most braindead and least fun killer to play as/against. The fact that you call “looping” a toxic exploit is a clear sign of a killer that has no idea what he’s doing. “So the problems are an add on and an exploit” YES. Yes. The exploit itself is not fixable without changes to the base chase mechanics themselves, or a complete rework of legion himself. The fact that he can do that goes to show that he was a failed concept. Here’s what legion counters: literally everything, while being stupendously bad at it. He counters hiding and he counters chasing (but as you mentioned, he can’t down people quickly if he doesn’t use the exploit or add on). Two main playstyles of the game, while being inefficient at it. You’re essentially playing against time, not the killer himself. A legion getting 4 frenzy hits is faster than him getting a frenzy hit and then downing with his abysmal movement speed, assuming the survivor actually knows how to loop. This makes it so that when playing against legion, you’re waiting for him to get 4 frenzy hits that you absolutely cannot avoid if the legion uses frenzy at the appropriate time. The whole appeal of DBD, outwitting each other, is completely gone because of legion’s ability. At least with m1 killers you can engage in a regular chase and can engage in mindgames. God, I didn’t want to have to type this all out. 
---
New game mode: 5 killers and one survivor with powers like Neo
---
Oh lol it has a community nickname now? Didn't know about it.
---
Huntress on console isn't that bad. But it's very annoying to flicker your shot when they are doging your hatchet 
---
Invisible Bear Traps?!
---
Was that a one off or were all the traps that round like that?
---
Yeah it’s truly amazing 
---
That's the strategy, be valuable to the team by hard countering Remember Me.
---
This needs more upvotes.
---
The only way to escape this is to Grab a vaulting Survivor, so you're totally at their mercy (unless they get overconfident and vault while injured).
---
That said, all 3 times it's happened to me I was Huntress, so I don't know if chainsaw-using Killers could free themselves.
---
Toxic attitude gives the rest of us a bad name.
---
Can you do it with a "GGez", please? 
---
I love this! You even remembered the scar on her mouth. You are very talented :)
---
All killers are lonely 😭
---
I had a heart attack at green ranks when I started playing
---
You can game bloodwebs.  If you don't want to learn how, just try and pick brown items...
---
Good for you.
---
Very cool, please make more!
---
Some background...
---
Throughout the whole round I had the feeling that his Myers was camping. Confirmed when he hooked a player who was running kindred.
---
Think I might run Kindred myself cause since the reset I'm down at rank 16-13  (can't remember which).
---
That was better.
---
It's hip to fuck bees
---
I’m more of a “Toxic Trapper” myself 
---
My God, where do all these quality memes come from from talented people drawing their own stuff? I love this. I love all pieces of original art.
---
It's missing the DC icon next to "The Legion".
---
Yay let's be toxic. 
---
Hillbilly.
---
It would except nobody would play it lol
---
I guess I was being a bit dramatic— Queue times were only 1-3 minutes hahaha.. TOO LONG!
---
And thank you, I appreciate it :-)
---
am i the only one thats NEVER  seen the grabing animation work correctly from the front and grab them by the neck before ?like i didnt know it can work
---
I am 30 years old, and personally know at least a dozen guys my age that own switches, but not ps4's or xbox ones, including myself. In fact, the only people I know that own ps4 or xbox are the 13 year old boys I teach.
---
Ps4 and xbox offer ZERO exclusive games I would ever want. My PC can handle the rest of the nonexclusive stuff that is any interesting.
---
The only games I would want that my PC cant do are Nintendo exclusives. Plus, there are quite a few quality eshop titles that are made by 3rd parties or indies. I have about 20 games on my Switch, and only 5 of them are made by Nintendo and physical.
---
The only game I can possibly think of that I would have any interest in owning on another console is The Last of Us. That is it.
---
When in doubt, correct someones grammar. You still havent hit me back with any facts so anything you say is disregarded as rubbish. Go do something useful and productive. Like hanging your self.
---
I get chased in that outfit a lot hahaha
---
I have never had to wait an hour in a lobby...
---
Yea! Though I’d really like to see a funky legion in game some time. It’d freak me out a lot less
---
I'll do more as soon as I will get my new graphic tablet
---
I agree.
---
Keys are the Survivor equivalent of a Mori since they give you your objective for free after you did part of the work.
---
As for Trapper's URs they're fine by themselves, but together on maps like the Game or Swamp you can completely block off huge sections of the map while having enough traps to permanently deny certain loops.
---
If you don't put them on the same level as this other stuff that's fine, but they are both hugely unfair advantages that are 'balanced' by rarity.
---
Probably didn't even notice she was there
---
i dont get it
---
1000 $ should be enough to get you a good gaming rig. Feel free to PM if you need any help; I would be more than happy to help you. 
---
I thought his name was Reuben
---
As someone who’s favorite zombies map is Revelations, I love you.
---
Yeah definitely and especially at the lower ranks when playing against new players who don't what they are doing yet. 
---
All of it little person porn. 
---
- All platforms
---
When repairing a gen that is against the wall the audio gets muffled when your spin the camera around. 
---
If they want to make it realistic, they would actually run a random direction while screaming and slapping at themselves.
---
I saw that shit happen. Sorry Doug.
---
thats interesting, i was a kid when i played sadx so i never really knew if there was any differences outside of being a port and the chao garden changes 
---
what a goon
---
Use NOED, I think most people would rather play against that than some toxic PoS.
---
There’s a game somewhere in this bug smarty pants
---
I like Kindred.
---
What I don't like is when you run Kindred, and all 3 of your solo buddies run toward you anyway. Thanks guys, but 2 of you can stay on your gens.
---
no I honestly dont care when I play as surv lol.
---
Do you play on PS4?
---
I wish I could kobe survivors on to the hook like I’m shooting a 3
---
PC 
---
Using DS isn't toxic. Making someone crawl to a hatch for 20 seconds just to pick them up last second and hook them while spam hitting them on the hook and nodding is definitely toxic. 
---
wow, I didnt know that. I wish half the video wasnt about insults though. 
---
I wish I had a pc everyone plays on it 
---
.
---
Wtf was that pallet throw
---
Dreamcast has transparency sorting far ahead of its time. When porting to GC, they had to redesign almost everything transparent. :)
---
My wifi is garbage but I get by. I am not playing killer until I get better ping. 
---
Great pic and joke. Only thing I'd say is you oversold it on the salt lol. I kinda liked the salt joke being on the side of the box only. Do with this info what you will
---
Tbh hiding behind gens and immediately restarting them is my favorite thing to do in this game

This game brings out the mental illnesses in people... Like seriously, this is the attitude of someone who likes to hurt small animals.
---
a lot of people here are something else
---
Rainbow Six Siege

Who hurt you?
---
Spirit, at low ranks she's just a steamroller, at high the mind game potential is limitless
---
Ah yes, The Legion Legion is growing in numbers

Drew Gooden? Cody Ko?

Somehow i kept my rank lvl 3 with the season reset, game crashed when my friend invited me to a game and my rank went back to lvl 3

Hehe I was elated after being abused and teabagged at the hatch so many times

Kaid from Rainbow Six Siege
---
fuck off
---
I see. You’re one of those braindead people who think the only people who should play Nintendo games are children and to be a real tough man you can only play gritty violent games all the time. It’s not like Nintendo is the only reason that Bayonetta games are still being developed or their “baby” games are critically acclaimed.

It's not offensive, it's just toxic behavior. You know, the entire purpose of the complaints against you. The fact that it is your intention to piss them off means that you can empathize with the person being pissed off, so obviously it makes you angry too... people aren't offended by you, you're just a pathetic type of person that nobody likes to play games with. 
---
They added a bunch of better places. We're getting there. It's much better then previously.
---
Exactly. That’s why I love this game
---
I just want people to give Bubba some love
---
I don't know what the hell this format is but i love it
---
yikes
---
I like how we've come so far that killers even playing the game at all are tryhards.
---
OchiDo's legacy everybody.
---
Memory &gt; memory or meme 
---
That’s why I play killer. Because I have no friends and like to ruin the gaming experience of others 
---
For sure! Really it eliminates a ton of questions. Is the killer camping? Is someone going for the save? Who is closest? Are others actively in a chase? It's incredibly valuable.
---
I should see my psychiatrist to consult my toxic mental illness 
---
Imagine worrying about flashlights in 2019. 
---
Yeah but that also means the survivor has to work on it in the open.
---
i dont feel like it would fit in the game.
---
I mean that’s sorta sad in my opinion. 
---
Awesome! What kind of doll did you use as a base? The hands look Monster High to me.
---
I had Nvidia Share off and couldn’t record it but then thought maybe one was streaming. I looked at the Steam profiles after the game was over and saw one of them was a streamer so I went to see if they was streaming so I could watch the VOD.
---
Same game released constantly though. And the latest Zelda was an over-rated bore.
---
As a killer, the only thing that will make me tunnel you with a flashlight is if you click it obnoxiously.
---
Blinded me in a chase and escaped? I respect that, it's part of playing to win.
---
Saved your friend? I respect that, it's part of playing to win.
---
Clicked your flashlight and teabagged me after you threw down a pallet? Welcome to hell, petty cranked to 11. Everyone else is invisible to me from this moment on.
---
Weird flex but ok
---
I used a Monster High Lagoona Blue doll 
---
（＾ω＾）
---
Depends on the person using the flashlight. Are they tbagging and clicking at every pallet? If not I usually don't care because at least they aren't doing gens they are just following you around or getting off a gen when you down someone
---
Doing gens and you?
---
*laughs in Survelliance*
---
It’s also important to mention that you have to click M1 and not hold it, or else you’ll just lunge anyways.
---
You mad OP? You realize that maybe there is a fair amount of people who enjoy the game and that’s a good enough reason why it has stuck around? 
---
Sure, a lot of threads on this sub don’t put off that vibe, but if people didn’t enjoy this game this would be a dead game and subreddit. Nothing is stopping you, or anyone else from playing another game. And DBD is certainly not holding a monopoly on the asymmetric 4v1 survivor game. 
---
Waluigi Spirit
---
Franklins demise :)
---
This is it, this is the peak of this sub. 
---
It’s the clicking they find toxic. 
---
Ive never found a survivor who doesnt use it correctly
---
aaaaaand? It's still a better version of Mirage's ultimate and her portal has SOME uses. Just being small is such a huge advantage by itself, as well as her passive always letting you know if anyone saw you EVER.
---
Game currently has wicked ballance problem just with character size and people have been picking up on it. You may have a good ultimate, but if you are so bulky that hip-fire no barrel R-99 knocks you with purple shield in seconds...nobody cares, in the end it's still firefight that decides games. I concede, all characters are playable, there are no Freddy vs Nurse kind of situation, but speaking of nurse...look at lifeline:
---
-Has passive that allows to pick teammates up.
---
-Has passive that shields you from one side, allowing to pick them up in the open more or less.
---
-Has passive that grants her almost golden backpack, allowing to use all healing items much faster AND STACKS with golden backpack.
---
-Has active that allows you to easily win early game fire\fist fights and allows for great item economy.
---
-Has ultimate that guarantees your squad purple loot or better, and since all ults have such low CD she is the one who gets all accellerants.
---
-Has smallest model in the game, with insanely small head and almost no shoulders, biggest part of her model are legs which have damage reduction on hit.
---
And compare it to Caustic :
---
-His passive allows his ability to be less detrimental to his team and does not work on edges of gas most of the time.
---
-His traps can be jumped over to be ignored and instantly destroyed by enemy who knows where to shoot, AND they hinder teammates all the same as enemies.
---
-His ultimate is most inconsistent thing, that diseappears half the time and other half it can get stuck on something and be useless because it affects FLAT PLANE, anything above or below is left untouched.
---
-Has head the size of lifeline's body and can't use cover half as efficiently as most other characters because he sticks out insanely.
---
As a Wraith main I would love to tell you its not like this but lets be honest 
---
if you bring a flashligh the Wrait his a joke :D
---
Y U M
---
What is the fucken gender of that lil shit?
---
I’ve been playing for a year and a half and can get it to work. So I never bring them in and use to drop it when I found them in chests
---
Personally I don’t find it toxic, but it is really obnoxious when a survivor with a flashlight blinds you every single time you break a pallet. I’d rather deal with that than a ton of other stuff in the game though so I just get on with it. 
---
This gave me a good giggle 
---
The huntress doesn't have RNG unless you lag.
---
Yeah I mean thats how I think its intented. After pallet breaks and pickups because thats animation locked.  Not toxic for me and a shitty reason to facecamp
---
I just find it stupid how u can get facecamped for using it how its intended
---
This smell.....
---
This smelly smell....
---
This smelly smell that smells....
---
This smelly smell that smells of SALT 
---
By cute do you mean creepy AF? Cuz if so, then yes. It is the cutest thing..
---
The trap here is obviously nea, lol
---
I agree 
---
Newsline : Mori is an offering. Which is an item, that is in the game. Also it's toxic because often used by cocky people who think they are hotshit because they stop at every pallet to blind you and then try to teabag.
---
It's not so much a glitch as it is bad luck. A skill check popping up the second you leave.
---
...It happens to me *every fucking time.*
---
Hahaha maybe a little bit! 😂
---
Gen tapping is ridiculously slow and if survivors are doing that you should be happy. It's not a bullshit tactic in the slightest. You sound brand new since it's clear you have no ide la what you're talking about.
---
Yes u have to report in game ad/or you can send a support ticket and use the report a player category. 
---
all i can see when i look at Jason is H20Delirious
---
I know what you mean but ill be far away from the gen then it will do the gen animation and fuck up the skill check 
---
I did the thumbs down for working w / killer. I'll try the support ticket as well. Where do i find that?
---
Im a killer and when i see that, i hatch grab then drop in hole. If im letting you escape i want some points. 
---
Wraith
---
I guess hex ruin, NOED, spies, and nurses 
---
Children like you are the reason us killer mains get shat on so much tbh
---
Pls I need the original photo! Can u give it to me?
---
No its really not lol
---
&gt;dumb
---
&gt;myer
---
&gt;fast guy
---
&gt;shirtless
---
&gt;bug
---
haha, just wait until you try to practice Nurse on console and then get squadette'd with flashlights
---
Lol yeah most swf use it for bait tactics which isnt toxic uts smart
---
Look at it this way, you got an injured survivor and a non injured right? Both in front of you. So you down the injured guy and hook him again the other dude is gonna go off and do a gen because he’s like well fuck this killer he’s just gonna tunnel so I’m out. But if you down the injured guy and then chase the other guy, that’s three people not on a gen ( the other being the guy who’s gonna have to come pick up the other dude) now by the time you’ve downed the other dude someone then has to come get him off the hook etc. Just tunnelling may seem the best pressure but it really isn’t, why take one of a gen when you can potentially take three off?
---
Monitor&amp; Abuse? Not sure if you need it since you have Prayer Beads.And honestly Tinkerer isn't that good
---
Yes! This is what I thought when first playing Apex XD
---
Die in a fucking fire
---
You justifying liking a woman who probably can’t even count to ten just shows how low your standards are.
---
This build let’s you sneak up on unexpected Survivors and yank them off the Hexes
---
Spirit build Hex Protecta!
---
Perks: 
---
Thrill of the Hunt Tier 3
---
Hex Ruin Tier 3
---
Devour Hope Tier 3
---
Whispers Tier 3
---
Perk build explanation:
---
Thrill of the Hunt- You obviously need this to know if any Survivors are working on your hexes. With the added slowdown of cleansing you will have enough time to yank them off of the hex if you use Yamakoa’s Haunting wisely.
---
Ruin: Ruin is a must have on all killers it slows the game down JUST A BIT.
---
Devour Hope: With this hex you don’t need to bring a Mori just get your 3 tokens for an insta-down and 5 tokens for a Mori!
---
Whispers: This is helpful for knowing if survivors are nearby so you can get a jump on them if they are working on a Gen or Hex!
---
Add-Ons:
---
Mother-Daughter Ring
---
Prayer Beads Braclet
---
Add-On build explanation-
---
Without these two adds on it makes it really difficult to get to the hex at a fast rate and to get an unexpected jump on a Survivor so these two are a must.
---
Offerings:
---
Black Ward or Putrid Oak
---
See you in the fog!
---
It's a 3-part series
---
It's not toxic, but multiple pallet blinds during a chase stresses me out a lot. I always feel like I need to lean on a hook for a while and take a break after experiencing that. Mental health is important, you know.
---
Lol I love how the answers so far are just exploit and moonwalk till they drop or throw on Frank's.  The scrubs are out in full effect today.  Take their advice if you want to know how to crutch your way to some "well earned" victories.  Dude just play high pressure on the gens, run discordance, keep them injured, mending.  If you get into a good position where you could down them shortly afterward use your power to get close after tagging them and take the stun of it wearing off and get your regular hit to down them.  If you get them at a pallet or loop just use your ability to get a free hit there's not much if any counterplay to that.
---
Yesss I thought nobody was gonna side with me on this lol I swear there’s so many more strictly survivor mains around who think they own everything. Killers should be able to play however they want... especially when it is 1v4 after all lol don’t see why I can’t have a little fun doing killer like shenanigans to end the game
---
True. Might as well get some extra points
---
That's why I said *almost* . I'm referring to add ons that increase the beam's visual brightness like the Tir Optic or the Intense Halogen.
---
Another defective 
---
The only thing toxic about flashlights is when they are being used by survivors to bm and taunt by clicking endlessly.  If you pull that shit you kind of deserve a camp, it's annoying.  If you use them as intended, flashlight saves and pallet or window blinds you're all good.
---
I love this! White men are so sexy. We don't need any killers of color pls. Keep this game right!
---
Yea she DCed so her friend could get hatch and says it’s not 4K lol
---
Spirit is reallly goood and is okay with FPS, Nurse is good but hard and shit with FPS (maybe use her after the optimisation in Spring), Clown is okay and easy, all the other killers (doc, huntress, trapper, wraith) I would stay away from the movie killers, except freddy and pig, bc I know quite a few people DC when they are against leatherface and michael.
---
Idk The only reason my 750 ti can run at 1080p60fps is because I turned down all the settings files. Done so for at least a year now and I’m fine. Generators look like minecraft for me lol
---
I remember reading somewhere that he was non-binary
---
That’s intended. Generator sounds are muffled through walls
---
I'd say you should use surveillance instead of M&amp;A so that way you can 3 gen them pretty hard. 
---
That feels like you just had bad luck. 
---
You could play anyone and have that happen. 
---
Survivors that disconnect at the thought of a Mori are children, and you being a slime bag for seeing a flashlight makes you one too.
---
When you reply to a comment with 15 downvotes and get 10 downvotes for agreeing with them.
---
&gt;Why would you say something so controversial yet so wrong?
---
On topic: wrote this as a reply to someone else but a Survivor stealthing around the map and making it impossible for the Killer to find and kill you *is* holding the game hostage. It's more traditionally done with Killer because it's far easier to trap someone as Killer, but making it impossible for the other team to leave is consider game hostage taking regardless of what team you're on.
---
Waiting on the hatch is borderline hostage taking (you're still wasting the other player's time by forcing them to find the hatch) but regardless it's still trashy and adds nothing to the game.
---
I seriously wish the hatch had a timer. Would make teabaggers stop wasting their time and actually give Killers a reason to do hatch standoffs.
---
That wasn’t an issue before the update. I use my camera like a madman when repairing and never noticed it before. 
---
It was introduced with the new update
---
I have a Switch and it's an inferior console compared to PC and my PS4 Pro. No Ethernet jack, hardly any DBD players PING is going to skyrocket since its WIFI connectivity is slightly lesser than a PS4 Pro. Unless they start to bring Killer bots then they'll have another problem.
---
I keep seeing people here complain about leather faces, so he was already off the table. I wasn’t sure about Michael since he’s such a big meme on this sub. 
---
I’ve been trying pig, and I’m still deciding on if I want spirit or clown next. I just don’t know how good clowns ability is.
---
someone uses map beacon to mark a location
---
me: holy shit guys the mystery box is over there
---
Its not just the gen noises that are muffled 
---
What else is?
---
Everything but music 
---
It can moonwalk into your dreams
---
So you sandbagged leatherface
---
DAAAAAMN! lol
---
I've played him a lot after picking him up. Finding survivors is really easy since they won't go full immersion at the slightest sound of a heartbeat, and those are also usually easy targets, making it easy to snowball out of control. All around, he's fun, if a little gimmicky. Doesn't stop people from playing him like a dick though, which is where the stigma comes from
---
Probably has Decisive anyways.
---
Thats quite sad considering the game is 18+. Some parents really dont monitor their children
---
When she opens exit gates, the Russian National Anthem plays.
---
what makes you think that?
---
I actually stuck a piece of tape on my monitor when I played huntress
---
Locker hitboxes are the true killer.
---
They don’t blind any faster than the base flashlight, meaning if you want to call something an almost instablind, you are saying ALL flashlight are almost instablinds. 
---
Yikes
---
lmao and this is why I always have unbreakable + tenacity
---
Facecamping and NOED
---
Well, depending on the flashlight and add ons my vision turns red faster or slower. I always look up as soon as I hear the click with max sensitivity (given I've not spotted the survivor) and sometimes it starts blinding but doesn't get the blind, and other times It blinds me even when I looked up, and I do the same move everytime, so that's not on me.
---
If it's not speed what does beam's visual brightness do?
---
You're a couple years too late, lol.
---
That one Freddy @me when I called him out for using NoED, only for me to be called salty for losing because my first down and hook was my last despite saving my team and doing gems all game
---
lolwut 
---
"NOED is fine because it's part of the game. DS on the other hand..."
---
Well the survivors were vaulting over pallets and kept healing themselves, so that didn't quite work...
---
Just that one, and it wasn't invisible, it was inside that pile of dirt for some reason.
---
https://support.deadbydaylight.com/
---
You'd have to upload the video proof somewhere and put a link to the video it in the ticket. I reported a similar case this way.
---
Nice suggestion, will try.

It's more commonly the other way around in my experience. 
---
Just last night I got matched with a 12 year old. He was very polite and enthusiastic,  and actually pretty good,  (he jumped in my chat whoopsie forgot to set it to private) but I kept wondering if his parents knew he was up at midnight playing this game 
---
Awesome thank you

Legion, Legion, Legion, Legion, Legion, Legion, Legion, Legion, Legion, Legion, Legion, Legion, Legion, Legion, Legion, Legion, Legion, Legion, Legion, Legion, Legion, Legion, Legion, Legion, Legion, Legion, Legion, Legion, Legion, Legion, Legion, Legion, Legion, Legion, Legion, Legion, Legion, Legion, Legion, Legion, Legion, Legion, Legion, Legion, Legion, Legion, Legion, Legion, Legion.

I declare this top tier. Have some gold.

Greed. So, I don't think so.

About damn time.

What does that mean? He's neither? Both?
---
3 Hands lol
---
Do The Bee next!
---
The gas is great for blocking a survivor from running to a good nearby loop. And yes, he THICC
---
I'd say this is also applicable to a 4K when there are already 3 gens done before your first hook. Happens on Lery's a lot in my experience. 
---
Always a fun perk combo lol
---
I always try to use Crows to my advantage without Spies but they just seem useless lol. Except for the Pale Rose crows, those are pretty helpful.

NO WAIT DONT THAT'S FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE

DISGUSTANG

don't let this post distract you from the fact that Susie's mask clips out of Joey's hoodie
---
Oh no T - posing legion oh god oh fuck
---
I actually did a build once that was all about seeing the killer. The perks were Kindred, Dark Sense, Sole Survivor, and Object of Obsession. 
---
The whole idea is that you can monitor the Killer's position and gen jockey at full speed. If you end up the last one alive, you can always see them but not vice versa. Sole and Object are essentially a two way mirror that favors you more. If it's really what you're going for, throw on Left Behind as well. 
---
I honestly just assume anyone that flames in endgame chat is someone's 10 year old sibling playing the game, makes it easier to avoid feeling salty
---
surprisingly unusual activation of muscles but fine
---
The thing is, let's not forget STBFL and Dying Light--the ultimate way by which the Obsession screws the team. 
---
op enhanced it imo. gave it his own touch. stop beeing a douche
---
If you get a skill check far away from the gen, it might be Overcharge then
---
I literally didn’t see it!
---
Nurse is hell but if you have good aim in something like call of duty or rainbow it will carry over
---
I wonder if his order isn't just right if he portions for it to be fixed or says the same thing he says about the game.
---
Believe me, I know. I found this sub less than two weeks ago, made a post about a game where 3/4 players disconnected, and instead of commenting on that everyone attacked me because they saw I was playing legion.
---
I honestly had no idea he was considered so problematic.
---
Claudette and Flashlight Blinds.
---
Dwight and Lockers. 
---
Meg and Exhaustion Perks. 
---
Bill and injured or No Mither gen jockeying.
---
Adam and Deliverance. 
---
Monto and Hex: Ruin or the Hatch. 
---
Obsession and Toxicity if the Killer doesn't have an Obsession perk.

I would unironically play a bee man rip off of  "The Fly"
---
Yeaaaa I’m on mobile LMAO

Who tf is the bee

I actually did this last night. Was hooked in the basement and the Claudette I'd spent most of the game working with was in a chase.  We were the last two left so I decided to quit struggling just to see if she'd have a chance and sure enough, post game lobby "That was the luckiest hatch I've ever seen" from the Killer. Felt better than surviving myself tbh
---
When they kill 1/4 and shit talk about the one kill that they got, usually because they camped or ran noed lol
---
[Template for other people that get Dead 'Arded](https://i.imgur.com/5MD7GQc.png)

I’ve been using nurses new outfit on PS4 and either her hair or blindfold keep showing up during game. Obscuring the view. It’s real quick but it throws off chases because you see something moving. Is this intended?
---
The shy ones only look naive, friend. 
---
Legion is the worst Killer in this game. 
---
Chainsaws are better than stabbing people in the chest 42 times before they fall down.
---
that's dope af my dude. people understimate the feeling of total altruism . i legit let myself stay in the trial to take people that are beeing face camped out with brorowed time. not all heroes wear capes!

Awesome! Does the video suffice?

Hate that. Slugged 3 with one on the hook with no gens done at rank 5 because they *all* tried to bum-rush the hooked dude when I had just turned away and they all ended up dead, but in the lobby they called me a camper lol I guess I was supposed to just let them unhook, heal right in front of me, and get back into the game before I pursued any of them; fuck me, right?
---
Super cute!!
---
Playing legion and being horrible at the game 
---
Haha saw this person yesterday also xD and sang the same song in discord 
---
Glad you think so! 
---
All I’ve seen the past few weeks is this sub discussing crutch perks, and now we’re moving onto taking the game hostage, so yeah, you are right
---
I get that. I just got annoyed when I saw OP responding to the original compliment in this thread without saying a word about the source. 
---
As an artist myself the most irritating thing is not being properly credited for your work.
---
This is just wrong lol
---
Hey I did the same thing with The Spirit just recently as well! Except it was completely on accident. I slashed at the window hoping to hit them as they were passing by but they had the balls to jump through just as this Claudette did. 
---
Anyone who says “GG EZ” in a pvp game is a dick.

What kind of clock do you own?
---
Freaky in bed. The popular ones are freaky in general-- no bueno
---
Gotta agree with ya here.
---
The Shape is hands down but favorite killer to play with, to play against, and just from a design standpoint. 
---
Downvoting this is petty it’s a simple opinion, grow some thicker skin, killers have messaged me and friends saying they facecamped because we all brought flashlights.
---
You want equal footing for killers? Works both ways, stay off this sub if you’re going to downvote people just for discussing. 
---
I’m left handed so I started from the left skkfkck
---
Just run back into the trigger zone, it should work, from my experience.
---
I think when you get a killer that camps just to camp, for no real reason than they want to camp, a tea bag or two is fine.
---
M &amp; A is amazing on her in general. True the prayer beads nullify the effect somewhat but you can still get surprisingly close to survivors before they notice you and the expanded terror radius in a chase giver her the option of switching targets without people noticing 
---
and many people complain about DS/BT/ADREN/FLASHLIGHT/SB/BL/LITHE etc etc etc etc (I don't want to list every single survivor perk) and still play killer. So yeah, the thesis is wrong.
---
Iv gotten 5bp for an entire match. Teammember had started on a gen nearby I heard killer coming got in the locker. He checked around that gen got me out of locker then facecamped till I doed. 5bp for locker boldness

Sorry to tell you this but insta blinds don't exist anymore, it was taken out when flashlights were nerfed the 2nd (? 3rd?) time. All flashlights, no matter what addons, no matter what quality, blind in the exact same amount of time which I think is 1.25 seconds but I can't quite remember exactly.

Yes, for the Love of God YES!

"You should of cleansed" should stop doing totems. It's bad for his health
---
Why?
---
Some of us are just used to a MUCH higher sensitivity, I'm a Call of Duty player and I play at 15 sensitivity out of 20, and a 13 out of 15. Dead by Daylight is so slow, most games offer an enormous range.
---
You are telling me looping ISN'T an exploit? God, if it was an intended mechanic they wouldn't have added bloodlust in the first place. The whole mending process takes like 10 seconds unless he has an addon. How many times have you actually experienced a legion chasing you with frenzy for like 10 minutes so he can get 4-5 hits on you and secure a down? Most legion players will either chase someone else or lose interest by that time. You said multiple times that he is inefficent at his job which goes to show even more how much of a weak killer he is. So your problem is that he is annoying? The clown can slow you down and prevent you from using exhaust perks, the doctor can shock you and stop you form using plalets and windows, hillbilly can insta down you, the nurse can teleport though fucking walls and your problem is a killer who needs to chase for way too long to get a down. Also, your idea of fun of fucking with the killer while others make gens is definitelly not fun from the killers prespective who chases you for so long only for you to use dead hard, sprint burst, balanced landing and DS to prolonge the chase even more. Suck it up and play against him or play another game if you so much hate holding your mouse button for 10 seconds. And before you say &lt;&lt;X killers take skill while legion doesn't&gt;&gt; then try playing a match as legion and try to get a merciless. Most clutch survivor perks don't need skill either yet you use them.
---
Adorable
---
Hag with mint rag/ shackles or granma heart running with surveillance/make your choice you will end the game before the 1st gen is popped.
---
Mint rag is being handed out like insane if you don’t prestige hag and constantly re level the bloodweb. Insanely broken/OP 
---
Where is totem exactly? I can’t seem to find it? 🤔🤔🤔
---
Funny post but I'm still shocked they're actually doing this, and this was my reaction before I even watched the trailer! The trailer is just laughable because the game looks like soup and the frames go down to the teens when showcasing the killer perspective. Who thought it would be a good idea to release a trailer with choppy gameplay? 
---
WHAT ARE THEY THINKING?! The mad men...
---
Then if you paid for DBD multiple times I believe you're God damn entitled to them. 
---
They're not a valid strategy. 
---
Don't defend camping.
---
Don't defend tunnelling.
---
You're garbage if you camp and tunnel.
---
Git gud at the game and don't try to rationalize your bad gameplay.

It's also called genderqueer. It's used for everything that's not 100% masculine or 100% feminine, so it's a broad spectrum.
---
HE was non binary?
---
Mission failed, we'll get them next time
---
He's mentally ill lmao
---
Just as a note, please remind him to not waste time waiting for that hit. If it doesn't come after a few seconds, ask him to either go do gens or jump in or just something. A big failure state with this game right now is that both killer and survivor will just stand and stare at each other for hours in the hopes that the other will give up first, wasting everyone's time. If the killer won't break it, it's best for the survivor to.
---
Blood.
---
If the planets align and somehow it does run at 30fps 720handheld/1080docked I'll def pick it up but signs aren't good.
---
So they gave you a compliment, and you proceed to insult their intelligence? What a world.
---
Oh my apologies, I did not realize that one could profit off of playing video games when they only have 7 subscribers on youtube, a total of 387 views combined and 12 followers on twitch. You must be a millionaire with those numbers.
---
So he/she/they/it/attackhelicopter is pretty much pyro from tf2
---
I get that ... but he didn't say that. I also play other 60fps games besides DBD, including COD, Battlefield and Fortnite etc... However on the enhanced consoles, the killer camera sensitivity is not an issue even @30fps … nor is the framerate. There are 4 consoles this game is on and he failed to name one of them. 
---
Bloodlust was created to deal with infinites, not looping in general so that point is moot. Also, anyone with a brain knows nurse is broken, except at least she actually takes some semblance of skill to play. Legion accomplishes nothing and is a completely braindead character, as well as doesn’t provide a fun experience for other either side. Hillbilly’s instadown works in the context of the game, and so do your other examples besides nurse. Nurse and legion both completely disregard the game’s chase mechanics. You are probably a killer that has no idea how to mindgame loops or run tiles hence why you think chases aren’t fun. To put it bluntly you still aren’t good enough at the game if you honestly don’t understand why legion is an issue for the game. Doctor’s shock is not even CLOSE to legion’s ability, sure it counters hiding but it has almost no use during chases since the whole shock stopping loops thing doesn’t work against any average survivor, hence why the killer is low mid tier. Enough with excusing broken shit with “survivors are fucking OP with their DS and exhaustion perks omg”. Don’t accuse me of being a survivor main either, I’m a killer main. DS is unfair and the devs are trying to fix it, and exhaustion perks are, for the most part, balanced (dead hard is not even that good since you can bait it, and the distance gained from it is a 5th of the distance any other exhaustion perk. Only reason streamers use it is because it’s the most fun exhaustion perk). And don’t you dare bring up perks being a crutch, because perks are designed to supplement your playstyle, of course they’re going to help you.  If you want to talk about crutches talk about Bloodlust. Requires absolutely no thought and rewards bad play. Bloodlust was just a bandaid fix for infinites, the devs didnt fix some of the god windows for whatever reason. Same for entity blocking windows. All the killers you mentioned have COUNTERPLAY whilst legion does NOT. 
---
“It didn’t technically matter he didn’t get his 4K” lmao stfu he would’ve if that person didn’t disconnect lmaoo

You underestimate my power.

I agree, as I paid full price for both games on both consoles and all DLC, but I'm not holding my breathe. I'll just wait for a steam sale to pick up the DLC later.

Well, this is cool and I'm sure this is unintentional, but it's also kinda cute, like it's part of a comic and the next one has Huntress carrying a bunny.
---
I’d say it falls into the samecategory as “Benji”.
---
Hey maybe i ran into you at one point haha!
---
You're brave.
---
Facecamping and tunneling means the killer doesn't trust in himself and thinks he won't be able to get hooks
---
sure, but my point is that the Doctor wasnt even looking :D
---
Maybe your skin is angering them?
---
If you're doing bees the killer 100% should be candy man
---
not always, sometimes the have another reason like just hating a specific survivor
---
Who do you main?
---
Dwight
---
Default Dwight.
---
I am sorry, but size of mesh/hitbox should not interfere in any way with collision detection. If it does, there is some other problem there that needs fixing.
---
I understand more complex hitboxes might have negative effect on performance of the game. I am no programmer and in no way claim to understand how it should work and how it works, but I have seen enough games in my life to know that tons of other games on this particular engine have better hitboxes than this.
---
But again - I understand this is first major game of this caliber from this studio, I understand there will be deficiencies and bugs - but the studio should in first place focus on polishing the game they already have released instead of porting broken game to other devices, that will probably not even run reasonably well.
---
Its about money, I know, releasing it on Switch will inevitably make more money than fixing game that is probably beyond the apex. But this is the problem of gaming industry in general, and these greedy decisions are what is killing the gaming industry in first place
---
An exploit makes him unfair to play with. That's why.

REMOVE the exploit and he'll be weak AF.

I hooked someone in the basement as trapper. Put a trap down was leaving the basement house when suddenly someone gets trapped because the survivor was camping my hook. Went back down grabbed em hooked em. Reset the trap. Walking away same exact thing happened. Went back down picked em up hooked em. Then I did wait because I assumed the other was coming. Those 3 died. And the other was waiting patiently by the hatch for me so they could T bag at me and then escape. And I didn't even get one blip for setting good traps. It's not my fault they were idiots and went one after the other into the same trap. It shouldn't be better for me to let them go so I can build up more points. Especially since a major part of my points comes from hooking and sacrificing people. 
---
it used to look alot better before the spirit update when they changed the grab animations
---
If you're playing Xbox, there's a way to change your settings to where you cant recieve messages from anybody except from people on your Friends list. I'm sure PS4 has sometime similar if you have that.

It's more of the "fun" she'll have with me

No.
---
Get some teleport action in there

Which is even cringier and typical of a manchild, you let the other 3 survivors gen rush because you got mad at a player. That's very sad.

Yeah DBD has it's fair share.

Your not the first one to tell me that....also got a 4 man with a mori at the end with the legion XD
---
Give it time. 
---
Even if I had been camping I shouldn't be punished for there altruism. If they want to save there firend so badly that they will die for it then let them. Otherwise if a camper is just camping one kill at a time they will likley only kill 1-2 people anyways.
---
I want a chef of some sort.. deformed like the doctor... heavyset like the clown but now as bad... meat clever or some other cooking instrument for a weapon. I don't know what his power and perks would be or anything but just chef themed.

I'm a simple man (wait actually I'm not but whatever), I see self-made, original art, I upvote.

I played Wraith a match or two back when I just got the game....

Then I met Amanda, and Rin, and Sally.
---
Now, Rin is my main, Amanda is my 2nd and Sally is my 3rd.

Myers. The best way to end a stand off as killer.
---
With facts and logic epic style
---
True but I shouldn't not be rewarded for doing my job. There altruism is there problem and shouldn't affect my score. 
---
Fookin ded ard
---
But if they are in comms they can coordinate one person to lead the killer and the other to grab the survivor while another is getting gens.

Sounds great.

This comes off as the typical teenage response to entertainment that isn't designed as edgy, violent or sexual.
---
True adults that have matured understand that there isn't a line in the sand for entertainment that you walk past when growing up. 
---
One of my favorite quotes is by C.S. Lewis:
---
“Critics who treat 'adult' as a term of approval, instead of as a merely descriptive term, cannot be adult themselves. To be concerned about being grown up, to admire the grown up because it is grown up, to blush at the suspicion of being childish; these things are the marks of childhood and adolescence."
---
Being embarrassed of, or avoiding, something deemed "not mature" because you think a grown up wouldn't play it is the very definition of immaturity and insecurity. In fact, often, many games marketed as "M" for mature come across as much more juvenile to me than your average "Mario" style game, because many M rated games are targeted directly to pre-teens and teens, that think that kind of stuff is a stamp of approval for being looked as grown up, when that is not the case at all.
---
In what case would the survivor "deserve" it? 
---
I mean hey...who doesn't Love a tall man.
---
You should have just picked him up and hooked him as soon as you got to him. No need to be toxic for him using something that’s in the game. If you didn’t want to get DSed you should have dribbled then. 
---
If you’re consistently being found at the beginning just work on a dull totem or not work on a gen for a second until the killer is thrown off, the killer is banking on finding a survivor working a gen at the start.
---
If the killer doesn’t find anyone on gens it throws them off their mind game and you’re already 1-UP’d them the downside is longer match time due to lack of working on objectives but it’s not much of a trade off if you’re already getting picked off at the start of the match.
---
Try teaming up with some good altruistic friends and stay near them if they are the designated looper and make sure they grab the killer attention.
---
If you haven’t noticed a lot of killer mains are choosing to see loopers/altruistic teammates as “toxic” or constant flashlights/bodyblocking turns for hook,  CAPITALIZE ON THEIR EMOTIONS!!!! 
---
If you can get your designated looper to emotionally stunt the killers mind games you’re already ahead because you’re affecting the killers emotions which can= sloppy swing/360’s 
---
Is not about reputation, is just about atraction
---
Haha thanks. I need to practice more again. Im a tad rusty!
---
That's a rather weird response considering the Entity itself is a being from another dimension of nondescript physique (apart from the claws).  You'd think they'd love to show more Lovecraftian kind of killers.
---
Always upvote original art, especially since I've never before thought about Survivor Huntress.
---
Like the power but mori could be more...
---
How about slams them flat on their back slices from neck to groin reaches on his sack tosses some herbs and spices on them and they start to sizzle. Mmm well done survivor.
---
Yeah he is easily spotted, never had such bad streaks him so far though.
---
My thoughts exactly.
---
There isn't much fetish art but there are lots of people who sexualize this game. Shirtless David, Concepts of naked Dwights, Trapper/Myers Daddy, Thicc Kate/Huntress/Clown.
---
I've seen them all.
---
Holly shit this gave me PTSD from when I saw Coraline as a kid that movie is super messed up, but yeah looks cool
---
You're playing against terrible Legions that probably know nothing about the game then. But what can you expect from Legion players.
---
You draw way better with a mouse than I could ever draw with the most advanced artistic devices.
---
Added literally 2 tires on top of each other in hopes a survivor wouldn't see it.
---
I personally did not like the latest Zelda game very much, only a little. So yeah, it was overblown to me. But it is definitely not the same game as previous Zelda titles. Not in the slightest. They changed most of the core aspects of the Zelda franchise.
---
I also usually don't like Mario games much. But Odyssey was a ton of fun. The new Smash Bros game is the best the series has put out yet. Mario Kart 8 is wonderful. These are all fun games that were crafted with great care.
---
I really disliked the direction Nintendo went in for the Wii and Wii U, but the Switch has been nothing short of amazing, and its booming success is reflective of that.

Always double back, you'll catch the one unhooking and possibly the one unhooked 
---
No, but the prayer beads do.
---
Now that i think about it you're right, the entity is a beeing from the depths of hell that can pull anyone anywhere to it's own world
---
Yeah, if you're working on gens first, you're a target. I like to find a totem, search a chest, or find some pallets for later looping first. If you do start a gen, count to five, head to a safe distance, and wait for a heart beat. Chances are they'll be there soon, and if they aren't, it's typically a killer with traps, myers, or they've found another survivor(s). Just work on circling your camera while walking/crouching and paying attention to your surroundings and your teammates statuses. 
---
oh i understand then. but still, i used to play like this like 11 months ago when i got the game lol, the ranking system wants you to go out and have a lot of chases though and playing the basement game isn't gonna get you pips
---
Kindred + as many people running openhanded as possible is fantastic
---
Imagine what I thought haha
---
You do. 600. Boldness.
---
I dont understand your downvotes. You're not wrong. 
---
Can't mind off the top of my head but what's the difference between Openhanded and Bond?
---
“They had us for 98% of the game, not gonna lie.” 
---
Fixed it.
---
The wraith being the one interviewed sold it for me. Hahaha 
---
I've seen sexual stuff before but I mean like the proper fetish stuff. Like foot fetish and bdsm.. haven't seen any of that
---
Fair enough 
---
Examples?
---
I've never heard Spirit's stun sound, I thought it was Wario noises edited in at first.
---
Oh no
---
There was a post yesterday where a billy teloported right behind a kid and downed him
---
Please read the edit, which I added about an hour ago.
---
So there's literally nothing a survivor can do to hold a game hostage?
---
Is there?
---
Bond let's you see other survivors auras within something like 36 meters but openhanded increases the range of other aura reading perks (like tier three kindred) by 8 meters
---
That wasnt the issue I had. To clarify I am a pretty good killer. I often tag and bag all 4 I'm probably going red this season. But in this particular match I had hooked someone in the basement. Then set a trap. Then as I was leaving someone snuck in right behind me but got trapped. So I turned around and hooked them too. Then I reset the trap. Then the exact same thing happened and I hooked the third of these ducklings. Now I did wait to see if the 4th would come but I was not about to walk away from 3 in the basement. So they all died and the 4th one was waiting at the hatch for me so they could T bag and them escape. I had no control over how that went accept to literally let them unhook eachother in the Hope's I could get them all again. So after that I didnt even get a blip for doing a damn good job. It's not like they lose anything because I get a blip necessarily. There is now direct exchange. So I dont really understand why it works this way. I should at least get 1 blip just for killing 3 of 4.
---
Yes, obviously? If the killer is keeping them from doing gens and keeping them from dying, then it's holding the game hostage if the survivor is trying. Less obvious than corner trapping or something, but still just as bad.
---
It honestly depends on how you do it. If you did bridges from 1 island to another, the map flow would suffer a bit. The Black Ops 3 Revelations map used thrusters that boosted you from 1 island to another. The map flow is actually surprisingly good too.

Yeah solo queue is absolutely brutal. My recommendation is to take a few seconds to scout the map before working a gen. I usually move towards the center of the map to work one of those gens, and make sure to always be in position to hide easily if the killer comes by. Then I get to work.
---
The killer will typically start a circuit of the map. Your goal is to wait for them to pass the gen you want to work and move on. Then you start working immediately, because they have classified it as having no survivors around.
---
If someone gets hit or put to sleep, sprint to a gen and get to work immediately.
---
Not off the top of my head but if you look ye shall find  :)
---
not toxic, just annoying I guess
---
You may not have looked deep enough. I suggest boorus or chans. 
---
“Ohhh nooo... please don’t give him false hope then kill him right before he can escape”. I do WHAT I WANT
---
I’m not sure you writing all that was worth it but ok bud
---
Coincidentally, I'm also a ruthless DM :3
---
That's exactly why. You can't play the game while it's installing 
---
That's where you're wrong, kiddo.
---
Obsession claws (ie Decisive Strike user) + Disconnect symbol
---
Even though it said ready to launch? 
---
Don't worry I don't want my poor susie ruined for me! 
---
Pig and NOED
---
It’s just a style choice. Why question it? 
---
Yeah y'all should run that more.
---
Yes the game requires an internet connection to play. A game while installing cannot access the internet 
---
Yeet
---
Disappointing but understandable. Hopefully I’ll be able to play soon 
---
Survivors are pure beings that cannot do wrong remember that ;)
---
Yeah what % is the installation? 
---
It doesn’t take 20 minutes to loot all chests and totems lmfao
---
from a [Rock Paper Shotgun interview](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/02/04/apex-legends-preview-titanfall-battle-royale/)
---
Frechette confirms that yes, Bloodhound is non-binary, or at least non-specified, in terms of gender.
---
50% 
---
Susie is a QT.
---
Lol yeah just be patient. You'll be able to play soon
---
I noticed a survivors do that once, but the window and locker were so far away that  had to be spamming spacebar before they even reached the window to do this. Were you by chance doing the same?
---
There is no such thing as map rotation. You simply are having some bad luck.
---
In the distance, two gens can be heard popping seconds after each other, followed by Meg’s echoing voice “*gg ez*” as she jumps into the hatch the spawned on top of her
---
Couldn’t find it 😕
---
r/subsithoughtifellfor
---
Yeah figured. I meant the rng of maps anyway as one would assume. 
---
Because what kind of style makes you put on a collar
---
She needs lessons from Umbra.
---
Downvoted for telling the truth
---
Just edit the word...
---
Yea my steam was kinda showing me it for 10$ and when I refreshed it was 20, that's why I posted.. No idea Wtf was that
---
The thing is, in this situation you are only at an advantage if you play the battle of attrition, just drop chases after you hit someone and go back to protecting gens until you have most of them injured and hope they get impatient and fuck up. If you commit to a chase, even with pallets broken,one of these gens can easily pop before you finish.....at least that is what should happen when i DISTRACT THE FREAKING KILLER FOR SO LONG STUPID IMMERSED CLAUDS.
---
I like that 👌🏻
---
Not really, they can do 1 of two things. Screw up her hit boxes or make it hit scan, which by making it hit scan huntress would be the most broken character in the game. 
---
My two favorite games! What is this, a crossover episode?
---
I've seen peoples with cosmetics where the killers is kinda burning on some part or something... Do we obtain those ones with prestige too ?
---
His Final Smash just makes him slowly increasing everyone's damage to 100% and they can't do a fuckin' thing about it
---
As a Wraith main this is me 90% of games with noed. Minus the ggez.
---
Yes you do.
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
Legacy skins are no longer obtainable, they're from people who grinded out prestige back in 2016 (apparently it was a shitshow back then to prestige) so they're exclusive to older players
---
No I don't! She's too innocent
---
Wanted to use a crosshair badly but after few months of getting recked and irritated I learned the hitboxes and it pays off. Huntress really is the most satisfying killer or anything really this game has to offer. Second is probably hitting those great skill checks or dead Harding just out of the killer's reach to your escape ;)
---
Over the Limit - "The adrenaline coursing through you body feels you with unexpected power. While in a chase or when being rescued from the hook charge power for this perk. When full: Taking damage that would put you into the dying state triggers a special 10 second bleedout that slowly goes down, when the time runs out or you get hit again during the bleedout you will go into the dying state (this bleedout overrides other perks). This effect cannot be used again until you are hooked. "
---
Just worked with an idea that popped in my head a few days ago, it needs tweaks but it sounds like a fun gimmick.
---
Ah... I see. Ok so now it's bloody oufits instead of burning ones then ?
---
Yeah kinda
---
Openhanded just modifies other aura perks so if you run openhanded AND bond it will give you 44 meter bond rather than 36 meter; Openhanded does nothing on its own
---
She **killed someone.** Coaxed into it or not, a pure, innocent teenager will not make that ruler as a weapon. Just go.
---
How did you know she already has art? At the very least she has the better art style over there......i mean what?
---
\*Incoming virgin downvotes just because it's legion 
---
yeah lol. For me its more of "when it rains, it pours". ill have a few great games, then a game where im just the worst player in teh world and i do all the wrong things lol. These are taken from my stream the other day where i was playing billy for the first time. Hes pretty fun, my new favorite i think
---
She doesn't even use a real knife!
---
What changes were made on the ptb? 
---
fuck... I thought that thing was dead
---
I mean I guess.... a poll said she's the (second) cutest killer (pig was 1st) so she's gonna have some art 
---
&gt;don't know if chainsaw-using Killers could free themselves.
---
Yea, I got stuck once as Hillbilly, you can still break it with the chainsaw. Also I saw a video of a Leatherface doing it too.
---
Could just be that bloodhound is one of the better legends too, especially when combined with bangalore
---
The killer could damage or block the hatch iirc
---
That’s maestro from r6
---
The thing all those games have in common: their fanbase saying "this game is going to kill dead by daylight!!"
---
Now seriously: all these games are pretty much the same thing as DBD. "Do these objectives and escape from the murderer". I've played Deceit and honestly I didn't have fun. I played Last Year and after a couple rounds it was just a matter of "learn the right place to block entrances" and "if you walk in front of this you'll die instantly". I didn't get Friday the 13th because I would only buy that if it costed 1 dollar (that game looks like a PS2 game but PS2 games were p cool).
---
Most people rank 10&gt; will wait for someone else to get attacked before doing anything useful with their time. My advice is to join them because everyone else is doing it. 
---
I personally don't and just get found on the first gen every time. I use Lithe + Dance With Me to get away from a chase with relative ease instead of trying to loop for a long time.
---
Other options include using the shroud offering to spawn far away and at least decrease your chance of being first.
---
Or run urban evasion and hide from the killer. Usually they fuck off pretty quick if they don't see you directly in the first 10 seconds. Thick mists are also helpful here.
---
Other than that you can just accept your fate and die repeatedly and be ok with that because it's just a game.
---
Yeah, you seem to be able to edit the videos just fine, the cuts are not bad at all, but the constant music has to go and maybe look to add some sound effects here and there, you don't have to do so of course, you can just leave the commentary in and it will be solid.
---
Traps.
---
Where
---
This meme is over used and old!
---
Just imagine 4 David’s jumping one legion and pounding them 
---
Oh look classic toxic SWF
---
Obviously their life isnt ruined you dumbass lol, it's just pathetic toxic behavoir.
---
Lmao. That poor Meg baby survivor
---
Yah and lots of virus’s I know allot of people who downloaded this and it fucked up their pc’s 
---
On PS4 it seems like people are disconnecting wayyyyy more frequently. It started getting bad, in my experience, during this past event. I'd say in 2/3 games someone disconnects as soon as they get downed. 
---
there are a couple idea i had a while back before spirit dropped, they could be tweaked better but anyhow here they are :
---
 Killer Perk:   Stockholm Syndrome
---
  Description: "Even with a clear escape route sometimes your victims  choose to stay in your realm, once an exit gate has been opened all  remaining survivors suffer from the exposed effect for 30/45/60 seconds,  also once an exit gate has been opened for 50/40/30 seconds the entity  randomly blocks one of the 2 escapes permanently." 
---
 If it was a hex then the exposed effect would be permanent but since my  idea isn't a hex I've given the exposed effect a time limit to balance  it.
---
  And here is my survivor perk idea:
---
  Survivor perk:   Don't Look Back 
---
 "The thought of Escaping your captor awakens a primal urge to survive  inside you, you wiggle 10/15/20% faster and gain 130% speed boost upon  successfully wiggling free, causes exhaustion for  60/50/40 seconds. 
---
 I believe this perk wouldn't be too op and is something that makes  sense, as it is most successful wiggle escapes lead to being downed  again shortly after so this perk would give the survivor a little more  of a chance to put more distance between themselves and the killer also  killers could still combat this with enduring and now adays with mad grit.  
---
Do you not use an antivirus? Do you click on every suspicious link you see? A virus should only really be a danger if you're, you know, a kid.
---
Legion:  (getting choked out on his knees by David 1)  “ACH!  UNCLE,  UNCLE!!!”
---
David 2:  “Please, call us ‘Daddy’.”  (high fives David 3 while David 4 starts unzipping pants)
---
Legion:  “**OH N-**”
---
I mean, maybe you really should. If you actually want to be rude and piss others off when they're trying to have fun and play a game, then maybe there's something wrong with you. Even more so if you take a game so seriously that you need to be nasty in response to other players playing the game.
---
Look here troll been around long enough and know better and that game was trash when it came out and fucked up allot of computers, I’ve heard it’s been cleaned up since then. 
---
Time to buy legion and hope for 4 David’s on my team 😳😏😏
---
i thought those were cows hanging up there not pigs...? i think the game devs should create some unique mori options for each killer and put them in the store for us to buy and equip when playing a mori, like a mori for the trapper where he throws you down and forces your face into one of his traps, the animation could show the survivor struggling to push back against the trapper forcing them down and finally they just get slammed head first into the trap and it closes with blood going everywhere....i got so many ideas this is just one of my favorites and it fits the killer :)
---
Too bad the trapper is a beta noed bitchboy
---
?
---
:)
---
I mean...they really didn’t HAVE to. They could’ve just defended themselves instead of all hanging up on the guy and take turns stabbing them. I think it chose them solely because they were still young. Easy to mold and manipulate. Sort of like Huntress was. 
---
It's funny literally have 0.25 kills each. I guess the entity chooses the ones who have lost everything or have nothing to lose? Maybe the Entity senses despair (and these teens were in despair if you ask me, I mean, they thought it was all fun&amp;games until the actual murder), and since they had some dark tendencies already, they were summoned. Idk. 
---
I love this shit lmao
---
Hi I gave you all the awards just in case anyone is confused, it’s been long enough that this issue has been happening since launch and should’ve been hotfixed eons ago, issues with servers or not 2 years of this shit is TO MUCH and it works BOTH WAYS!!! killer brings in survivor pudding and survivors DC denying the 3x hooks 
---
What ? Sorry i dont understand 
---
Killer² 
---
"Oh no he's hot"
---
In Haddonfield if you put the trap on the roof by the window vault, it goes invisible too. 
---
Even saw it on Puppers’ youtube a few days ago
---
Classic trash survivors, need 15 crutches to actually make it out and still t-bag killer like they aren’t awful at the game and toxic lol
---
Alright. I put in the command, "winver" here is what popped up: 
---
You had me until that teabag garbage.  
---
I love last minute saves like that, even as the killer you gotta respect a Hail Mary.  But miss me with that toxic shit. 
---
You must be pretty damn good and play all day if that’s the case, you may as well not even have 3 other teammates then and just go 1v1 the killer 
---
Nurse is good Bc she counters Pallets and windows. Its not bc she has few counters (she does have few counters) its bc she counters what the meta is based off of. Spirit cant break pallets and cant vault while and spirit mode. Yes she is a good killer, But you can mind game her if you are good
---
Spirit's drawback is her phase sound, basically nullifies her power supossing the survivors are not deaf.
---
THAT SAID, Prayer Beads with Discordance, Surveillance and Nurses Calling makes her the best killer in the game with basically no counter to it.
---
BUT that means she's dependant on a purple add on, which Nurse isn't, so that's why I'm ok with Nurse being S Tier and Spirit being A Tier. She's better than Billy though.
---
Urban Evasion + Iron Will
---
Spirit makes the game a big brain competition 
---
Welcome! to dead by daylight brother 
---
Yikes - a five-way disconnect.
---
I can change that
---
No, you have a bad connection. That's called lag. Game runs great for me as long as that bar is green in the lobby.
---
Don't hurt my susie 
---
This is just a shitty cropped Ver of someones art they posted on this sub
---
heavy panting ensues
---
yeah you could probably safety pip or even pip in a 1v1. do like half a gen before a killer finds you, then get chased for 8k boldness aslong as it’s not an op killer. don’t have to be good, just need to know what you’re doing.
---
HAHAHAHAHHAAHAHAH, you underestimate me, how do you know she is not already hurt?
---
Because susie is cute and she didn't want to go alone 
---
They can’t without dedicated servers 
---
What have you done to her!
---
"Well...this is my life now"
---
Her and nea brother, oh and the huntress. I have lots of stuff that no one else has seen before, my personal collection 
---
Survivor: *dead hards into a wall*
---
Eat all the pallets.. nom nom!! Just bluntly chase a survivor the boring way until you catch them 
---
What did you do to susie! She's top cute and innocent!
---
She is a q t though
---
Top cute is nea mate, But Yes i commission lots of things 
---
The devs said that for chapter 11 it’s gonna be the oldest killer yet and many people speculated a mummy
---
There is a counter: When you are in a chase with her, look at her. If she stops it probably means she is phasing to reach at you faster. However, she can only see your scratch marks. Don't run, walk in another direction and she will probably lose time trying to find you again. 
---
And if you have a bucket full of black jelly beans and add two white jelly beans, that doesn't mean your bucket is diverse. It's more diverse than before, but not diverse. 
---
I never said I owned it. I just forgot I had it saved on my phone 
---
Spirit is definitely a PvE killer, and her add-ons are overtuned, but when compared to Nurse I don't think she needs nerfs to her power itself, but her add-ons (especially Prayer Beads, Wakazashi/Tsuba and Yakyoke need changes)
---
Nea and susie have the same animation when selecting the character we'll call it a draw..
---
But what did you draw?
---
