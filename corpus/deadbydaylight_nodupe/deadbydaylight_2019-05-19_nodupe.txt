I was watching my friend play killer and I believe all our of the survivors got away because he's still learning. At the end they gave him tips about perks and how to prioritize better as killer. Was very wholesome.
---
---
---
Exactly
---
I played Hag today for the first time in forever and holy shit I lost so many people in the corn lol.
---
Those guys suck
---
Clown: Bamboozle, Ruin, BBQ, and Enduring
---
Because BBQ gives you blood points and even if it isn't too good on killers without mobility, at least you have that bonus. PGTW is too situational on any killer which isn't Nurse, Billy or Spirit.
---
You say NOED isn’t that bad, but at the same time how annoying some survivor perks can be. Thats just biased
---
Those add-ons that give you extra blinks are nice aswell
---
LMAO yeah, imagine!  
---

---
***Blood Rush***: *proc'd from holding your arms up for so long that they fall asleep, forcing you have to put them down for a sec so the blood can rush back.*
---
Joke aside, I do think saw refills should be a thing, especially if Billy's zoom-zooming around with minimal downside. He's is pretty well balanced but is OP in terms of map pressure, especially with Ruin/BBQ. That would give his map pressure a teeny tiny nerf but nothing really to him specifically. 
---
Bubba can keep his arms in the air in front of a hook... until the saw runs out of juice and he has to go get a refill. 
---
My fav killers to play as and against are ones that have to use their power fairly strategically but I know they want a variety of killer play styles so I'd be surprised if our crazy suggestions became a reality.
---
To all the killers out there: it's not supposed to be an equal or fair match. The survivors are supposed to rise to the challenge presented to them by the killer and survive the wrath of the entity. It's not always gonna be a 4K. This is a horror game, not Pokémon.
---
I'm not sure, maybe around 45 hours with Pig. I just like ehr even though I know she's not the best. Maybe I'll try Billy since apparently he's good.
---
Gone through like 50 bloodwebs on Bubba and Myers, still can't find my enduring and spirit fury.
---
"There's room for only one camper 'round here."
---
Check out - https://www.twitch.tv/psychoscorpionz - He's a Pig Main &amp; I've learnt a lot from watching him
---
Depends on the map and killer really. Then of course comms flips the entire thing in the survivor’s favor. What I will say though is that if a killer and four survivors of equal skill go into a match, the killer will always get a 4K or 3K and hatch escape if the killer decides to use some powerful add ins.
---
"This basement ain't big enough for the two of us."
---
Pretty sure that’s all ranks 😂
---
Decisive isn’t annoying...
---
Just don’t tunnel
---
No you misunderstand. I have no problem with any perks in the game. I only said "annoying" because I see those perks being complained about on this subreddit as well.
---
I thought was pokemon so I've been telling my Pokemon to complete the gens so I can get out. Wait, am I playing the game wrong?
---
You'll still hear moaning with Stridor granted it's tier 3 Stridor
---
My bones
---
Was he camping for the whole match? Because otherwise it makes some sense that he’d camp when the exit gates are open, dude just wants to secure a kill.
---
&gt; Its BM and commonly known as such by anybody who
---
And this is the problem. Someone playing the game can't really be bad manners. Acting elitist about it? Sure, absolutely bad manners; however, just its simple use isn't bad manners. It's in the game, therefore it's fair to use, so calling it scummy or douchey doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Criticizing it for being horrendously imbalanced, no issue, but labeling people things because they're using what's available to them in the game? Cmon... That's just being childish.
---
"How dare you guys play with friends in this game you trashcan piles of shit"
---
Might as well be
---
"How dare you use NOED or Ruin or play Nurse you trashcan pile of shit"
---
The game is there to be played. Criticize its elements, but your anger shouldn't be with those who use them, rather with those who created them. It's not the player's responsibility that 4 man SWF is ridiculously strong, though it *would* be the player's responsibility for acting arrogant *because* they're in a 4 man SWF.
---
Gotta aim your outrage at the right target, friend.
---
&gt; It's like being cut off in traffic. Sure, they didnt necessarily break a law
---
Actually, that's not true. At least in my municipality, we have an offense known as "failure to yield the right of way". It's a pretty common offense when we write someone a ticket in a traffic accident.
---
Console or pc?
---
You kidding? If I thought dc-ing would result in even half a depip, I'd dc every other game. Fuck high ranks, their long ass queue times, and the next to no variety in killers.
---
PC
---
This was such an idiotic change. Getting a 4K with adept perks isn't easy. And Survivors don't have to get a double pip either for some dumb reason. I don't understand these devs.
---
As someone who doesn't play a ton, I really hate rank reset. I'm around rank 8 usually but get reset down to 12 or 13. My potato teammates DC or suicide on first hook in like 80% of my games at this rank. It's hard to rank back up when most of your games are a 3v1. Factor in the killers going tryhard as hell with moris to pick on the lower ranks and it is horrible. Solo survivor in this game is way too hard these days, makes me want to join up with a group and go SWF since that seems to be how they're balancing nowadays...
---
He was chasing players longer than he should've (so he only got 2 hooks all game) and so he facecamped because he was bad
---
I personally don't find it annoying, but I see it being complained about on here and in-game. Also I've had it activate on me and I wasn't intentionally tunneling. I can't keep track of every survivor and how many times I picked them up; as a killer, I kill who I see. If I see you twice, then that's just bad luck for both of us I guess.
---
The whole game, he was facecamping? Or just at the end?
---
Feelsbadman. What a joke
---
You didn’t answer the question
---
Damn i have been playing a lot lately (ps4) and so many disconnects it’s getting really annoying. And finding games takes so much time
---
Maybe try playing killer?  
---
I've been playing survivor less and less lately, because of similar reasons.
---
Bp doesn't affect how good a perk is. We're gonna live forever gives you bp
---
I said why he facecamped so it is an answer
---
People like you who give honest feedback and ideas give me hope
---
OW did bring it back with a few changes that I think could be beneficial. Now it allows you to block up to 3(?) people for a handful of days; once that time is up, they are unblocked and added back to the queue.
---
I don't think it's something that should be in dbd right now but may be useful once dedicated servers take over.
---
Unfortunately can't get dead hard in my bloodweb :(
---
It's not just console. I'm a pc player and have had a very similar experience on this exact map, in this building too. Saw it also happen in another post, same map same building. Not sure if that was pc or console though
---
No, but a 30 seconds timer where you are forced to find a gen and lose your momentum it does make a perk bad.
---
100% agree, it’s nearly impossible on lower ranks
---
We do what we gotta do
---
In Canada 2 minutes feels like 2 seconds, they got mixed up eh
---
Considering that the exit gates were open, what else should he have done? It's not like he had any other objectives to patrol.
---
I used to use PGTW on clown and it was great for protecting gens. But like you said, very situational.

I like stuff like that, makes the community just that much better.
---
They should crank up the amount of hits it takes to activate to 4 or 5 and have their aura automatically be shown for a determined amount of time once activated. I don't know if also including exhaustion for the length of their aura shown would be too OP or not.
---
He’s saying that because the legion engaged in long term chases without any reward, he face camped the people were hooked as punishment.
---
The Merkins are so great.
---
That's when I attack the rescuer
---
Only killer I got leveled up is the spirit and can confirm this is true 😎
---
impressive XD
---
These kind of things always gets me idk why, i end up watching it like 15 times and laughing.
---
Happy cake day good man
---
i wouldve gone for the window
---
One time i was trying to get adept Ace. Matchmaking was taking long as hell, so i left to go do something. By the time i came back i was in a game with 3 crows on my head and one person on the hook. Both gates were open. By the time i started moving, my teammates rescued him and were able to escape. I literally did nothing and still got the achievement, but i guess that’s the kind of luck you get when you play Ace.
---
My awareness definitely plummets when playing Bubba
---
I think having NoED is much better than rancor. I just don’t understand people who run Haunted Ground, NoED and like Ruin all at once. that’s a very big waste of perk slots.
---
they dont love us that much
---
yknow u right
---
Some killers (me included) get paranoid about 4 stacks and just don't want to deal with that being a possibility and may lobby dodge if it seems suspiscious. I try to avoid doing it though, as it is unfair.
---
but fuck you
---
Love the corn, hate the Plague.
---
Very fake.
---
Happy to report my next game after this post was a 4 man escape against a nurse (albeit, not the best nurse) with ruin!
---
Its not.
---
😂😂😂
---
People usually dodge because of bad ping, or even bugged lobbies(if that is still a thing).  
---
Some people use programs to "block" others and dodge them on purpose, however.
---
Good to hear you bounce back! I always have rough days with this game, and taking a breather is never a bad thing! Try your best to have fun, not just win the match!
---
Personally, I have fun win 4-man SWF groups.
---
The killer maybe is dodging because you or a fellow survivor has bad ping. I do it all the time because the guy with 180 ping will refuse to leave.
---
Sone are fun but most are toxic. It gets annoying if you don't want to tryhard
---
from a survivor main, no. camping is just sitting there at the hook and doing nothing else.
---
Imagine seeing a Bubba take someone to the basement, seeing him leave the basement, going down there to save him and seeing ANOTHER BUBBA already there with insideous
---
Next Huntress skin best be Muriel
---
Follow up question, when they're healing with nurses on can you see the aura still while phasing as The Spirit?
---
Thank you :)
---
We need one for survivors too
---
Is this a preview of DBD for Nintendo Switch ?
---
I got my Adept Freddy the day they changed the rank system and boy let me tell you I was hollering happy that I still got enough points in Gatekeeper.
---
So that's why my Pokemon wouldn't battle
---
Rotten fields is the worst
---
It was his fault for why he facecamped.
---
You tie it off with "GG EZ" but no, seriously, yeah, hard to be nice around here.
---
This map maybe is the most survivor favored in the game because of all of the safe pallets, it's like the opposite of shelter woods
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
I play fully solo. Also if the killer thought the other 3 were SWF and didn’t want to play why not leave asap instead of letting the lobby fill and letting everyone ready up. We all saw the results of the survey which showed 3/4 man SWF are few and far between anyway.
---
I second this notion
---
Id settle for a survivor and killer each everyday
---
It would be way to situational to even run
---
As a bad killer I try not to facecamp unless it's a 4 man (I looked at the profiles and most were public  and they were all on one person's friends list) who got the gens done really fast
---
I’m on PS4 and my ping was fine for all of them. If it was another survivors ping that was the issue why wait to leave and not just cancel the lobby straight away. An hour of my time gone trying to play just one game is not ok.
---
Wait times stuck too
---
Oh damn!! I love that perk!! I use to run a lot of balanced landing.. but I'd take off boil over and trade that in for something useful
---
"GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY BASEMENT!" Plague then throws up on them so that they DC upon getting DS'd.
---
Props to you for playing solo. Tbh i try to not cue dodge but i can understand why some people do
---
So, basically any conceivable game with 2 Leatherface's?
---
The effect is just as powerful, you just need to do something to get it. Honestly taking hits isn’t that hard and is often something you should be doing for your team regardless
---
One is an insta down which causes me to be on the hook?
---
If you're going to post raging about a camp there better still be gens up in that bottom left corner.  No one is going to take you seriously for complaining about an end game camp dude.  He has no other objectives to patrol at that point.  It sucks but the situation is understood and begrudgingly accepted by like 98% of the survivor player base myself included.
---
Maybe try applying more map pressure for gens? Sometimes just smacking people and walking away to end gen progression is more important than hooking someone. I wouldn’t go the face camp route just because people want to play swf (unless they’re BMing and overall toxic dickheads).
---
All I'm saying is yall get the benefit of seeing what survivors are bringing just not how good or bad the item is.
---
True. I didn’t think about the potential lag
---
Come on really just a casual glitch around the map?
---
That’s why you add frequency as well, leaving more chances to slip up and make a mistake. Even the best don’t hit ruin every time.
---
No if he gets mad I just do this https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bh9j1e/a_killer_was_camping_hatch_so_i_decided_to/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
Lol you literally watched him set it.
---
Play swf then no worries. Make friends
---
I dont care about the fun of the survs
---
No, he forgot the part where it just throws him on a fucking hook for 10 hours.
---
Agreed, I went against this Wraith two nights ago and two people DC'd... whatever. NBD.
---
I'm last alive and he slugs me, hits EVERY gen then closes the hatch. He comes back to pick me up and takes me to the gate. He lets me wiggle, so I can 99% the door. Then he slugs me again so I can die to the entity.  Just standing there shaking his head over me. This is awful but I DC'd . I didn't want to stay slugged for 3 more minutes.
---
Got a GGEZ post game. I asked him why waste my time and got a reply of "fuck you c-nt". Then he left. 
---
I don't BM or play like an asshole so it's just... disheartening that someone would go so far out of their way to waste time in a TWO PERSON FIVE GEN GAME.
---
But frequency doesn't even matter, since they'll hit most if not all of them. I think there needs to be a better change.
---
Gotta love big corn on console.
---
XD
---
Give me shit campers say for 500 please Alex
---
He camped because he was chasing everyone too long. Hell, he got a 2k because one of the other 2 who stayed didnt get the unhook on me. The other guy trying to get points by blinding killer got out
---
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC97Ksfd9TJGEumZ6PvsN5gQ Here you go!
---
Oh really? i had no idea what the chainsaw does 🤣🤣
---
Corn is just evil.
---
More like not bareback 0/10
---
Maury = Mori
---
Just gonna quote the other guy and say, "You didn't answer the question."
---
Nah we good
---
How high?
---
yes and no I knew if she grabbed me I could hit her with it but I wasn't %100 she would grab me
---
Not at all.  Working through Ruin should be no problem once you've practiced your skill checks.  It is only "OP" against either very new or very bad survivors.
---
No, you can't see auras while phase walking.
---
I'm going to put this template to good use
---
i usually only play for an hour, 2 tops.
---
Played  as Killer couple days ago...got Corn Maps THREE times in a row....map rotation is broken as fuck.  Unless you play against potatos, yer gonna have a headache of a time.  Several maps are just unfun as Killer.  Hate the super dark maps with P3 players (esp Luldettes) that become super immersed and my eyes strain to find anyone when they play whack-a-mole with hiding and popping up.
---
They have made the survivor achievements so much easier, and the killer achievements nearly impossible. I remember when getting adept on survivors you couldn’t jump through the hatch. Same with the ones where you cleanse a certain generator on a special map; you had to exit through the gates and at least tap the gen to receive the achievement. Now everyone on the team gets it even if they didn’t touch said generator, lol.
---
But it still gives you a great deal of information and even free downs.
---
I'm just saying man regardless of the situation leading up to that hook, it doesn't matter much.  Once the gens are all done killers can't realistically be expected to leave the hook.  It makes no sense on their end logically and our only argument against an end game camp would be entitlement.  Now if he pulls that shit with gens up that's a very different story.
---
Really? I'm getting plenty of views 😆
---
Turns out it was the ghostface is from scary movie lol🤣
---
Basically running bond by looking through a #palletfilter
---
Then you dont need to advertize your shit
---
I try not to facecamp even when I get genrushed by a 4man unless I've had a bunch of shit teammates or 0 kill games
---
Actually some surprises in that list, notably 4 over both 3 and 1, as well as 2 over New Nightmare.
---
For me it's:
---
Dream Warriors 
---
Original 
---
Dream Master 
---
FvJ
---
New Nightmare
---
Dream Child
---
Freddy's Revenge
---
Remake 
---
Freddy's Dead 
---
If we're being honest, it surprises me I don't have Dream Child in the bottom 3 of the series, now that I think about it. But the last two are the only ones I genuinely dislike. I can at least tolerate every other movie.
---
I did answer it
---
Left
---
Right
---
Uh son! Uh son!
---
Snatch and run all!
---
I can understand dodging in some scenarios which I have in the past and still do. 
---
Like if I fancy playing Wraith or Hag and 2 or more survivors have a flashlight. 
---
Or if i’m doing a build with no Ruin and 3 or more have toolboxes because RIP the gens. 
---
I even stay as killer if one player has bad ping because if the other 3 are fine I figure i’d rather play the match anyway and make do with them lagging over leaving and waiting 10 more minutes. 
---
At the minute i’m playing maybe 9 out of 10 games as killer but when I try to have a survivor match I maybe get dodged 3-4 times before I get a game. And with nearly 10 minute waits it just becomes a waste of time.
---
Stop comparing a chainsaw to DH it's just dumb
---
Yeah I've noticed that too. Probably get fixed next update if the post gets popular enough.
---
I feel you. Overall if I’m just getting outplayed and can’t really get any momentum going, end game I’ll just soft proxy people to bait survivors for hits. Maybe snag a kill or two. Killing everyone isn’t ever really my main goal, just want those sweet bp
---
Just think its dumb I gotta take hits to activate a hit. It's like killers having a perk that only activates if they get ds 2 times...
---
lol no
---
Tbh as ive said i get both sides. But it is more common on a survivors end. Plus you get killers thatll just  cue dodge for no apparent reason.
---
You must be a genius!

He couldve gotten a 3k if he tried to down the other player trying to  get points but he continued camping so he got less kills. If you do bad you shouldn't facecamp  because it's your fault if you dont hook everyone at least once
---
It's a bug and one of the Dev's provided more insight to some of the reasons why it happens in the Dev Update post from the other day
---
Dev reply here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bpdb9o/developer\_update\_may\_2019/ensacjl/](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bpdb9o/developer_update_may_2019/ensacjl/)
---
I can’t fucking track survivors with my eyes because it runs at like 25 FPS
---
I have every killer and survivor and I still to this day get splinters for Freddy and Myers but go off.
---
that jacket is tight, nah mean?? i could talk about Scary Movie 1&amp;2 forever
---
Oh god trust me, this was just a random 3 man that invited me and we were all fucking dying. The killer was laggy as hell.
---
After doing some research online, I think you're right. Tried everything I could, but the problem persists.  This problem doesn't seem to have a solution other than waiting for dedicated servers. Well... I guess I have to quit killer-DBD until then. :/
---
What a bro.  a claudette wouldnt even bother with you
---
I'm sorry man but you are coming across as sounding extremely entitled with that last statement.  Again come endgame all bets are off.  Only a meme of a survivor complains about an open exit gate end game camp.
---
Imo the extremely strong effect makes this (possible) new perquisite fair, since it’ll still be worth running but not in every build now, because MoM isn’t in a survivor perk tier of it’s own
---
It’s good for everyone when survivors aren’t just running the same perks because those perks are so much better than other options
---
OI. Not all of us are brain dead idiots!
---
Even as a survivor it pisses me off
---
between lobby dodging and disconnects ive just decide to give the game a break
---
The disconnects that is
---
the exit gates are literally powered lmao. You got hooked, should’ve been better at looping. Can’t be mad at a LOW TIER KILLER (Legion) for camping u at ENDGAME. git gud ?
---
Wrong, Hag doesn’t have 14 traps
---
/s
---
Pretty funny overall but only brain dead Hags waste all of their traps on one hook XD.
---
yeah pretty much
---
The facial expression of dwight kills me 😂😂😂 like "what in the fck?? O.o"
---
Soft proxy camping is fine if you didn't get any kills but  facecamping isn't 99% of the time
---
Switch lookin' great
---
Good thing I don’t face camp lol
---
Hold down the PlayStation button on your remote-go over to dead by daylight-go to currently playing with, then you can see every player including the killer while still in the match. Otherwise just look at their names after the end of the match.
---
Recently met players doesn't work for DBD for some reason and the last player it says I met was in call of duty 3 about three years ago
---
Why should he get it for free if the devs had nothing to do with him ever? That makes no sense.
---
What killer do you tend to play most? Because I figure the answers will be different for each
---
Oh gosh I had a type I meant shouldn’t lol don’t know why it said “should”
---
Yeah just because your friend is the license holder of the mask and tells you you'll make the announcement doesn't mean he should get it for free while every other Ghostface Fan like me has to pay for it.
---
I think this is a bug, I saw this same thing happen to a streamer.
---
Nah, you still have to buy PS plus for everyone of those accounts to play DBD :/
---
So, ultra rare?
---
I'm far from rank 20 but seriously, fuck that corn.
---
l
---
I’d love to still see one every once In a while though, they always make me chuckle!
---
Myers
---
His 2nd one was for ban evasion and he almost certainly cracked/hacked his exclusive cosmetics back.
---
Then thats theironly power, looping is easy
---
Hard to tell a good survivor can loop a killer for a bit. A top tier survivor would get crushed instantly by two mediocre killers. If they hunted together, killers could pick apart survivors at will. Might not be fun? Or I’m totally wrong and new strategy would develop!?
---
What would you consider BM? I shook my head yes to a killer the other day over a pallet (he was tunneling super hard so I just kinda gave up) and he messaged me at end game saying I was being toxic.
---
pig also has traps to waste your time
---
But u can see her
---
Thank you, this meme was funny the first 3 times it was reposted
---
We can let them fuck
---
Ghost is gonna cost money
---
If I already have lvl 1 or lvl 2 perk, then I take it to get it to lvl 3.
---
If you paid attention I said Im not the one to come up with it. I'm not going to sit here and bicker with you. It was just an opinion and you're getting on my case about it.
---
Thanks!
---
Oh boy you are gonna love ghostface because he can do that and one shot
---
Nope, select an account with ps plus as primary for that Ps4 and you are good to go!
---
Survivors killing themselves on first hook drops to zero
---
Tbagging and flashlight clicking at every pallet with 4 annoying to vs perks assuming killer isn't camping or tunnelnig
---
I mean I feel bad for him because he didn't get to announce it but I don't like him begging for compensation. I do think he deserves compensation though.
---
Why?
---
There should be more.
---
it worked hahaha, post bait only a krueger connoisseur will be enraged by. he only gets mained by die hard elm street fans, literally no one else plays him
---
It's almost as if totems shouldn't activate until it affects someone
---
I mean, communication in general is cheating.
---
Seeing as it can be destroyed in the first 60 seconds of a match, and often is, that's gonna be a no from me dog.
---
No I'll hide nearby and unhook them when it's save to do so - that way we both get away safe. If I bodyblock then I'd go down and they'd get free. What's the point?
---
He doesn't deserve it though he literally posts can I get some free auric cells or something. He seems like child because he didn't get to leak the killer first
---
uhh... uhh.... naked Myers! hahahahahaha am i right? upvotes to the right

It would be cool if everyone got to pick a “best player” at the end of the game, regardless of role.  So you could thank a good killer, or a good survivor or whoever you felt did a good job that round
---
I saw the original post a few days earlier. So happy people are using it :)
---
But if I slug them, they'll complain about slugging.

Easily exploited. If you die (not a requirement), disconnect your internet. You will see everything.

I've been jumped scared by survivors as a killer due to corn.
---
And? Let them complain lol. Last I checked the role wasn't survivor happy maker it was KILLER. Kill them however you see fit. In most matches I will knock someone down and just leave them anyways. A survivor on the ground can be very good bait and also works to stop generator progression.

but if you body block nobody gets a hook, far better for your team in the long run, not even a debate-able topic.

I played against a Legion who DCd when we broke her NOED.

How many hours do you have?
---
Don't always go for the swing after a blink! Make sure you're close to the survivors first. I've seen many a nurse whiff a blink attack
---
Communication isn't cheating.
---
;,333 senpaaaai OwO’
---
Ok, anything else I should know?
---
Feelsbad when I cleanse 3 or 4 totems when I play survivor and the randoms cleanse none. Don’t understand how survivors issuing second chance perks is toxic, but noed isn’t. I understand why both sides use second chance perks tho ( play killer and survivor equally)
---
You're right. Honestly I feel like your best bet as a killer is to hide the post-game chat box because after all, you're the enemy - usually nothing good comes up in the chat.
---
So you’re telling me if they add that as a cosmetic you won’t buy that?
---
Your flair is literally “legion the best”
---
I don’t think I need to take anything you say seriously.
---
Then you clearly don't play Survivior.

---
I play both equally. What do you mean by that?
---
It was mostly a joke since so many toxic people wait just to tbag when the killer gets there. They would find another way to BM no matter what they did.
---
In the face of The Entity you told them NO and won. If you bested The Entity, you're too powerful for me. Have your escape.
---
The Discord may well be (shocker) to allow people to talk to each other. It does not mean that third-party communication is being allowed/accepted into the game. If that were so, there would be voice chat in-game. So far, there is not, and the devs have said they will not put it in.
---
Is that killer within IV?

this is now my fourth time having gotten nea to level 50, still nothing.
---
As survivor if someone is being chased I do up the last gen and go open the gate normally. If no one's being chased and I know everyone's looking to complete the last gen, I leave last gen at 99% and run to an exit gate. This way once End Game starts, I can already start opening the gate. As killer, if it's last survivor, don't close hatch until survivor turns up at the hatch, once you spot the survivor, then close it and you'll know exactly where the survivor is. Most killers close hatch immediately upon finding it and survivors can immediately start opening an exit gate.
---

All players now have a Disconnection rate/percentage next to their names.  Higher disconnection rates will pair with high disconnection killers.  Resets after season end.

However, the discord is supported by bhvr, and they have final say over what is allowed and not allowed
---
My bloodweb gives me good perks, but I dodge those for No Mither
---
Its real fam wtf. I dont have balance so i couldnt maintain the squat so my ankles inverted and i fell over
---
Funny thing is I'd be dying laughing if any killer did this to me as long as Myers has his trap beat and other killers have a heartbeat trap beat.
---
"Im ga- *feral frenzy runs out* aAAAGHghhGhhhhHhgnnnnn"
---
Hey, I get salty players on Steam too!
---
Too true, when you try and study how streamers are so good at juking and you see them jump through windows when the killer is right behind them and the killer hits the window, im just like "I would have gotten hit right there."
---
Yup xD
---
And that refutes what about my comment, exactly? They can't exactly stop people from joining up and making parties.
---
Depends if it’s pale rose or not. That pantry is aids with the right setup but pale rose is really not too bad. Both are ugly as hell to look at though.
---
They had us in the first half not gonna lie
---
hmm let's give you deja vu instead of quick and quiet haha I hate my bloodwebs
---
3 killers and two survivors... seems like the devs did a pretty good job so far
---
Ok so he doesn't deserve to make the announcement that he was told he could make because he says "can a man get some free auric cells lol" and some weird tweets?
---
I guess the Trapper can fill in temporarily, although he always busts out the death metal vocals during karaoke night.
---
Man I would love New Nightmare Freddy so much. Only thing I would want more is Super Freddy.
---
They never separate those stats by rank, buddy.
---
That was rank 20 SWF and rank 1 SWF combined.
---
I mean, if you take that as gospel, then fine, but it just means you will be wrong as fuck when the real stats come out.
---
Holy fuck, I'm crazy, for knowing what those stat sheets were showing, vs what you want to see.
---
The killers stats at rank 1 show they have a really low kill rate at ranks 1-5.
---
You didn't compare 5he stats to eachother, or Nah?
---
Its just how it is. Only people who don't care about winning enjoy this game, no matter what happens. Sadly, when win conditions are present, people want to win, and try their hardest to, fairness or fun be damned. That's why so many people will run the good shit and nothing else, because they can't win, and have fun, without it. Making it fun (or at least not a waste of time) to lose would fix this, but sadly, we probably won't get that. So each side will hate each other and complain, because they can't both have fun.
---
Whenever I get annoyed with survivors being dumb I play killer until survivors start getting smart again and switch back. Get people on rank 10-12 STILL attempting escape on first hook like dumbasses.
---
i guess survivors who are rank 5 and up are not good
---
Cowshed and Thompsons can be way, way worse. Abattoir is a little smaller which probably helps a little bit.
---
yeah just fuck corn in general, both sides.
---
&gt; They never separate those stats by rank, buddy.
---
Because it doesn't matter.
---
&gt; I mean, if you take that as gospel, then fine, but it just means you will be wrong as fuck when the real stats come out.
---
Lmao it's factually correct and there's literally nothing to argue here.
---
&gt; The killers stats at rank 1 show they have a really low kill rate at ranks 1-5.
---
No shit, the game isn't balanced around the top tier.

&gt; You didn't compare 5he stats to eachother, or Nah?

Learn stats better.

###YEAAAAAAAAAAHHHH
---
As a pastel bob Nea main, I get it
---
If the kyf display is what you noticed first I have some serious questions for you
---
True true. 9/10 games survivors run the same builds and vice versa to killers. Maybe we should all just let go of our grievances about perks and just try to have fun😭
---
Yup, nobody will feel obligated to go on a gen they didn't start if they will be one shot.
---
I'm pretty sure that I'm aware how to have fun in this game after this long, but thanks. :)
---
Okay, but both of those examples were from the beginning of the life of the game. Over time ideas change. They may not have wanted people to use voice communications towards the beginning of the life of the game, but it's obvious now that they do not mind considering some of the developers use discord to play with other survivors
---
Haha, I just enjoyed my sandwich. I would have gotten dizzy from the constant camera reorientation otherwise.
---
Yo let my boy Larry alone
---
Upvote for New Nightmare Freddy
---
We need a killer with a weed whacker.
---
[deleted]
---
It didn't seem like it was purpose, i've faced this killer multiple times and this is the first time it had happened. Not defending this person, if they are lag switching. Felt some lag near the end of the game and then this happened probably just a desync from the host. The killer did let me live after all.
---
made by someone...  zombiehuggerr i think it is.
---
So instead of just downing the survivors, you chase them all match hoping they’ll farm with you? Then take the time to post this on Reddit?
---
https://youtu.be/AVCEWxOkc0s?t=332
---
The dev stream with that quote was within the last several months. Their thought process is still very much the same.
---
I've never had those problems on Xbox with corn. For me it's always red forest and swamp maps that my frame rate drops
---
Her terror radius is reduced but her hum is normal
---
Man this shit never gets old lmao
---
As someone who plays leatherface, I don’t really feel like he needs a buff
---
Especially when his primary weakness is getting looped, buffing him like this is kinda uncalled for
---
A-A-Are they face camping each other ?
---
The new killer is the 4:3 aspect ratio
---
*Sees player level*
---
Nice.
---
Would be perfect if there is a loop version.
---
There is techally only two with no TR, Myers and Freddy have one though small.
---
Wraith you can see and hear uncloak.
---
Pig makes noise and can be seen
---
For Myers it's kinda all he has.
---
And Freddy.. Well just loop him.
---
I do it most of the time if I can.
---
If we go for kills, a clean stab is way better than impaling, if you know where to hit
---
But if it’s for fun then impaling is godlike
---
(Sidenote: I’d love a killer who throw spears on survivors and impales them on the ground, from which they have to remove themselves)
---
Not using u/ZombieHuggerr 's template 0/10.
---
Reminds me of that one toy from Toys Story.
---
That your tag?
---
Also like someone else said, they would have to make it 2 different killers in order for these strays like nurses spamming their blink
---
That's as high as it can get. Idk what happened, but I legitimately had a lobby with a ping of about 10 seconds. Not even joking. It took 10 seconds to update the chat and the character I had selected (character selections are sent to the host before being sent back to your client and showing the character change). The ping was still shown at 1100 though.
---
Wow, first time seeing a killer spawn next to his Hex totem.
---
^^I'm ^^sorry ^^for ^^the ^^lame ^^joke.
---
Use the LFG subreddit.

LFG stands for Looking For Group

If they dont want to farm, just smack them

Thanks man!💯

Thanks
---
I find this is more of a "rank reset" issue than an Endgame issue. It was around long before EGC lol.
---
I would love it if we got the whole crew, but I feel like due to the Friday the 13th game it’s not going to happen.
---
It's from a convention type thing for Bitconnect which is a type of Cryptocurrency
---
I will point out that on console there is built in system party chat so in that respect it’s definitely not cheating
---
Finally. I do wonder why the real thing hasn't been datamined yet though like the old one
---
I use pizza dwight with watermelon pants
---
Pretty sure it existed literally just to counter hatch camping killers. Which is not even existent these days with EGC lol. What a perk!

This doesn't work all the time but it helps sometimes, you can try and see if it helps, once your only option is exit gates, go to one and power it up to a point just before the first light comes on and go hide nearby until killer has come to check and moved off, and start powering it up as soon as they move off. The other option would be to power it up till one light is on as bait and stealthily move off to the other gate. This doesn't guarantee you'll win, but you could try. It's better than just YOLO opening the gate and getting downed by a NOED nurse.
---
From my experience everyone will just stop everything and rush the hooked guy. I get you want belevolance  and WGLF stacks but let's get the gens done too. 😅
---
You can wait up to a minute before the person enters second phase. Ya don't have to save them 0.00001 seconds after they get hooked.
---
Traps don’t tick while in chases, she only gets a set amount of traps, they have long timers if you die to a trap it’s on you unless the killer has top tier perks
---
Sometimes Claudette farts and I get 2 fps. Honestly though, it seems like so many little things trigger frame rate drops. So far I've seen it happen when:
---
\-A surv 360's
---
\-A surv has long flowing hair or accessories that move
---
\-I swing at a survivor
---
\-I lunge at a survivor
---
\-A nearby totem breaks
---
\-I'm using a skin that has moving parts or is otherwise complex (like the hallowed blight skins)
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
None of them are all the time, but all are some of the time. It's weird.
---
Zooming on the picture in mobile is wack since the description takes over half the screen so I can’t see the faces
---
Just saying
---
Good for you, gratz!
---
What? He was way better than Billy when the game first started, because he was the only one who could stop infinites.
---
They had no idea what I was attempting to do, and expressed such post match so I had to explain it.
---
Most killers can't be countered when they face camp, which is exactly why you should just do generators instead. If you try to use BT against any facecamping killer, you run the risk of getting pulled off so it's generally not worth it. This is a separate, bigger problem of it's own that involves all killers.
---
As someone else mentioned, limiting the time they can rev their chainsaw won't do much. They'll definitely see a survivor that's going for the hook and it won't take them long to rev their chainsaw down them. This is exactly why limiting the rev time won't really change the problem
---
She can call in a hooked chain at a diagonal angle downwards, if aimed correctly, it can damage a survivor and break on contact
---
It can be used indoors and can be used to block off area’s, mostly doorways and windows as it has collision
---
Add ons will determine the speed of its spawn and the range
---
I like them, but I feel like the killer perk is kinda encouraging facecamping
---

---
I love Clive Barker and the Hellraiser movies too but I just didn’t see pinhead chasing multiple people down with bloodthirsty intent. Even in the first Hellraiser it’s the female cenobite chasing Kirsty with a blade and not pinhead.
---
This is my first concept so any criticism would be appreciated even rude criticism
---
If you're on console, best advice is DON'T.
---
Respect 100
---
you dropped the best pallet in the game with borrowed time on and he wasn't even chasing you yet, lets talk about you pallet stratagem instead...
---
I wqnt my bloody valentine so much as a DLC it hurts me it doesnt exist.
---
I play her and personally she is really fun and not op or bad at all it's just she is balanced there is nothing really broken about her to even talk about her or play her.
---
What I learned from this reddit is that 100% of the games you do bad in as killer is due to the survivors being a coordinated SWF, and never because you were just bad or that the survivors can actually be good solo.
---
Exactly what I said.
---
its pretty important as a sharpshooter as well, yet most gun games have enemies that stand out pretty well, its almost like its not real life
---
Same. I remember watching it as a 7 year old and oh boy I loved it still don't know how Chucky scared me back then either. I think my concept really works on him as it brings out the fast and tracking from him in the movies from my memory he was a pretty good tracker and killer.
---
Try playing through SWF even if you're solo. Fixes it for me usually.
---
This meme is kind of a reference to what was posted earlier on this sub that had a summary of one sentence for each killer which is probably why it was posted
---
I’m on pc don’t worry
---
It would and it can have a mining setting and the killer just walking around asking people to be his valentine.
---
Usually if you let them do Gen's in front of you they'll get the idea, after you are close enough you can pick them off Gen, and juggle them so they understand that you're just trying to farm
---
Yikes. I'm gonna take a bet and say it's either a David or Nea maybe a Feng Min.
---
Even better is that most of he time Mandy told grim what to do and he listened
---
Pink-shirt Ace ftw.
---
I for some reason even crouching along the outer walls or behind a tall enough hay bail to even stand behind but somehow I'm still being blinked to and hit even though I'm sure I didn't show myself to her
---
Probably my favorite dlc since huntress.
---
That’s what I think too, no one ever talks about how she’s god like or how she’s shit tier. Very neutral killer.
---
You could always camp around the edges and wait until the nurse gets someone. Also when a nurse is in fatigue it's the perfect time to hide because their field of view is tinier.
---
You pretty lucky twice a ruin spawned in the very corner of the map on swamp. I now check the edges of the map before anywhere else for totems now.
---
For me it's less about going into a match going "ok, I'm going to 3 gen this match" and more about how it plays out. Generally I'll do it if there's ~5 gens left and 2 are way further away from the other 3, I'll just tactically avoid patrolling over there so they find them easier to do, and the last gen becomes a 3 gen.
---
It's something you should be trying for every match to a degree, as if the last 3 gens are spread out (excluding with a high mobility killer) and there's multiple survivors, it's going to be nearly impossible to hold them all.
---
Camp ception
---
Best strat is to wait until either everybody is sick, or there is only one fountain left, as when all of them are corrupted they all purify
---
Yeah I rarely see the clown too. I got the DLC for him and I enjoy him but I’m such a bad killer unless I’m playing the doctor lol.
---
What a disgusting build
---
why is there an /s??
---
I'd rather not waste about a generators time of work just for someone else to get downed
---
This is what Tier 3 should be
---
The things people say about you reflects more about the person they are, rather person you are.
---
Well this game has pretty faithfully recreated most of the licensed killers, maybe they see Jason as being better off here instead of that bug fest
---
This. And people (and by people I specifically mean the toxics on this sub) will argue "If you can't handle someone crouching a few times/clicking flashlights/insults over post game then don't play!" Me enjoying myself silently isn't bothering anyone else, but if I were teabagging and telling killers to uninstall, I'm bothering someone. "It's just a game" isn't an excuse to let assholes just...be assholes. 
---
Toxic = Tunnel. Fucking expect it.
---
And that's not including if the nurse is running hex ruin
---
Hmm mm no no no!
---
Sometimes people just post on your steam channel. So if you post any picture they’ll just hunt you down and talk smack. Happened to me a few times so I just made my steam account private.
---
Um, no. On one of the first livestreams the devs said they didn't want to add voice chat because people already had things like TeamSpeak and Discord.
---
Going against four survivors with that build is such a struggle.
---
Even though I know it won’t happen... if shorty was the survivor for ghostface’s DLC I would pay a gross amount of money for it lmao
---
She isnt bad just not fun
---
Stealth doesn't work too well against Nurse because she doesn't need any perks for stalling and looping. She can use four detection perks.  
---
It works fine against below average Nurses though.
---
It's a shame too, I quite enjoy playing against them. Rather than camping Bubba's every-other game. 😔
---
Freddy when he finally gets his rework. (And hopefully it’s actually better)
---
She is like clown very balanced in very way. Every other killer seems to have something bad or good about them while those two are very balanced and have some op adds but nothing game breaking. Weird that a fat 80 year old clown with asthma and drug addiction and an ancient priestess that has the Plague are the most balanced while a deformed hillbilly with a chainsaw and tiny woman that hated her job and teenagers are the most unbalanced(good and bad)
---
The Lawsuit is the only thing preventing this, once it's over, we can finally have Jason in this game.
---
I agree man people need to play both sides  equally and not support players that play that way.
---
I mean the hag smacked him at the top of the stairs when he was still crouching why wouldn’t he run?
---
I think people just don't know how to play clown. All the clowns I've faced never used their bottles plus Plague has only been out for 2 months so it could rise. I think people are so used to huntress and her projectile so when they use clown or plague they feel off and just don't use them.
---
Took me a second to realize the edit! Good job !
---
It should piss the survivors off more than anyone else, so it should be even as a killer it pisses me off
---
I feel like a dad now 😩
---
They should just make left behind keep its current numbers (maybe slightly higher) but for the exit gate
---
Yeah, I guess I could brighten it up a bit, but the idea is Freddy's face.
---
This is what I am talking about!
---
Knew it. Idk why but Claudettes haven't been toxic lately for me. Man I love Neas. Most try to mimic old Noob3 and fail or they are extremely good and nice.
---
Yeah I always have trouble hitting her purge idk I see videos of monto getting hit from ridiculous angles but I cant hit them at all especially two in one hit I also find her ability to be boring because it just gives the broken status effect or they can cleanse and you can get corrupt purge to hurt them I like killers with more mind games
---
Captain Obvious
---
Yes, but it's still a change based on SWF showing that they are in fact thinking of SWF when making changes.
---
I love playing clown and he is extremely strong in a chase, it’s just that any time wasted against him hurts a lot. Certain buildings can make it very annoying for him.
---
Then you get hooked and camped or not saved by your teammates that do nothing the entire match.
---
As a nurse main, I can only really tell you a few things. 
---
Like someone else said here, you dont always need to swing after a blink. You also have a slightly worse lingering since you're just a slow killer. 
---
Be weary of people trying to figure you out. At low ranks people dont know how to use tires or double-backing to their advantages, but at any kind of green/purple/red ranks it's important to learn a survivors tendencies before they learn yours. If they always run in a straight line, blink in a straight line. If they like to do some 360s or locker jukes etc, make sure you adjust to it. 
---
At first you should just run add-ons that decrease the cooldown of the blink and charge up add-ons, don't bother with any 3/4/5 blink stuff. 
---
And of course, practice.
---
I bet Kermit would lead him to the entire team.
---
Not really necessary if you know totems spawns.
---

I got into a game last night to mess around and get my daily with billy and I hardly ever play him, so I went wizzing around with my chainsaw making circles and it was the red forest map with the house. I needed 3 chainsaw now downs, well these guys just kept running right out in front of me as I’m wizzing around and finally after the 5th time I was like screw it im gonna start hooking them for extra points, well after it was all said and done I got a 4k with 4 gens left. I wasn’t even trying and didn’t mean for them to die but 2 didn’t struggle on 2nd hook and the 3rd guy didn’t get rescued while struggling and the last one was just messing around or something and stepped into my lane as I was coming by. I was gonna let them all live but it didn’t go that way. Easiest 4k I have ever gotten lol
---
I see her every now and then. It's getting to a point where the only time I do see her is in the hands of top notch players since it's easy to skirt around the sickness part.
---
this is old...  also obvious lag switch.
---
You don't make damaged sounds but you do make normal breaths so it is pointless.
---
What's yer offer?
---
“I play solo survivor, randoms are good eno-“
---
Yup because that asshole who just DC fucked you and the rest of your team on a possible win!
---
Englund looks way too grumpy, he should be grinning deviously.
---
I don’t think it was ever datamined. I believe it was taken from the online manual, where they have it on the perks section.
---
Ahh, I misread it, thought it said "give me **the** Iridescent Head," not just "give me Iridescent Head." Just realized this, thought I'd better give an update
---
I think it needs a buff if it wants to see actual play in games
---
\*moans in gay\*

Wanna play? I’m US add me localxjoker
---
Survivors get away all the time without looping. You have to run away and hide in a crafty place while sneaking around. Does nobody consider stealth?
---
If all a survivor can do is loop, then the game needs to be changed around completely because killers don't want to run in circles all day, especially in 1st person mode.
---
It has one of gaming’s best narrators.
---
It’s fun seeing people complain about toxic postgame chat on this subreddit, you go back into their history, and see “if you suck at killer i will tbag u, loop, and make you dc”
---
(not directed at you)
---
You got hit with an invisible pallet
---
I'm a Killer main. Who tf complains about "gen rushing"? That's literally the objective.
---
You misspelled Lampkin Lane
---
there should be a mandatory option for people who finished the trial (alive or dead) to vote on best survivor, the survivor with this achievement gets 10k bloodpoints
---
Most certainly. It's just like, "what, is this middle school?"
---
Your comment now has 69 upvotes. You're welcome.
---
Bless your heart.
---
I just hate the swamp, don't care which one it is i hate both of them as a killer and survivor
---
BLOODY GENIUS!
---
"congratulations,you played your self."
---
r/unpopularopinion
---
0:23 That Kazotsky kick is on point tho
---
Yeah I can't fathom why BHVR thought just upping the numbers would fix it. EGC literally neutered the perk lol
---
Add a totem counter to it and it would be much more viable.
---
How many people really know EVERY spawn on EVERY map though?
---
I personally always seem to run it lately. Between NOED and Ruin, it's a keeper
---
Never knew I needed this animation besides Tpose
---
Noed Myers. 🙃
---
No shirtless Myers for Christ sake he doesn't have emotions he is like a killer robot only made to kill
---
I doubt my friend would lose to a meta team of SWF with Freddy at this point.
---
He shows what killers are REALLY capable of
---
Nice perk, but some kind of a buff to it like a totem counter would make it pretty viable.
---
Or have it where you can replace one, but just straight up remove others you don't want
---
Non-brown/P3 Claudette master race
---
The entity must me a kinky bitch
---
This. So much this. People say survivor dcing on first down is bad.. I'd rather play a one sided game a few times an hour rather than no games an hour.
---
I like it. I run into a lot of killers running hex ruin and noed so it comes in handy. Especially because I can't find totems for shit.
---
you've seen noed Myers
---
but imagine a NOED Nea
---
I’ve been running it. Fairly good perk that’s fun to use as well, and if yer against a Trapper or Hag it works great to know if there’s a trap or not.
---
I don't mind tea bagging honestly. It's been in games since the dawn of online gaming, but for some reason the dead by daylight community take it so personally, its comical.
---
To be honest, I don’t know if something will ever be done about it, in terms of online games DBD doesn’t have that big of a player base so I don’t know if BHVR is at liberty to pain or discipline people for talking shit and playing like an asshole. 
---
I honestly wish something could be done about it, and hopefully I’m wrong! But I play on both Console and PC and I know BHVR does nothing to console players because of this exact reason.
---
and then everyone points at you and tbags
---
Link and shadow link bouta through down
---
Due to how survivors load in, most of them load in at the roughly same time swf or not. Swf sometimes load 5 seconds apart, solo randos load in at the same time. Dodging because a bunch of people join at once will almost never dodge you 4 man because you're just dodging most lobbies.
---
If they all have the same name sure. But even if they're all pizza dwight's you cant assume it's a 4 person. I once went solo with 3 other solo (confirmed after) aces and we all took the same outfit that we all happened to have as a meme to be cute and funny together. Killer rampaged with salt about swf.
---
They messed up their gens, it is not your fault by any means.
---
And also you aren't camping. As a survivor main, I would totally realize that my team and I fucked the gen repairing order.
---
Perfect ^_^
---
Gen rushing isn't a thing. Signed a sweaty ass nurse main.
---
I always get adept in my first try or two and I'm lucky as hell. I recommend taking keys or hatch scumming. It's not nice but it's easier from purely the "escape as x" viewpoint!
---
Yes let’s force them to miss out on half the game because they’re unable to get a better connection, genius! You can stop your crying when dedicated servers come out.
---
This is badass.
---
It could be. That's the problem with p2p matchmaking. I wouldn't feel bad about it though.
---
Someone had ds.
---
Haha thank you!
---
I keep seeing people claim its a cycle, its really not. People are drawn to the meta perks because they want to win, not because someone of the opposing side did something to them.
---
Or Cadiomegaly
---
It's jarring when you play with her how much shorter she is. It's great in the corn, I find it easier to find survivors in the corn with her.
---
What are you talking about, we have everyone in that video?
---
We got Michael, Trapper, Freddy, Leatherface, and now we're getting Ghostface.
---
The gang is totally all here.
---
Fair enough.
---
I either play killer and everyone DCs, or I play survivor and me and/or my friends DC. Honestly, DBD is currently unplayable. :/
---
As someone with a little over 1000 hours in the game, always love seeing someone enjoying it. You should be super proud of your achievement
---
I love the idea, but what would ever lead to bayo wanting to be a killer?
---
Not worth the effort lmao
---
wow Nea looks like the peeps from Roller Coaster Tycoon 3..
---
NOED and Rancor are not meta at all for good reason in higher ranks. You don't want survivors to get to end game in the first place so you use tracking and stalling perks to secure more kills. It's why Ruin, Nurses, Whispers, BBQ, Enduring, and Sloppy Butcher are all prominently found up top.
---
From what I understand, he also used this privledge to gain more followers by msging the deets privately. I could be wrong about the latter part, but he did try and use it for followers. Dude more or less deserved to get the spotlight stolen. Nothing more than that though. I have no idea whether the threats are real or not but no one deserves that shit.
---
Maybe a pact with the Entity? I actually didn’t think about that, but i’d still love to see her in the game
---
The lawsuit is actually over. Although I can understand why they would totally still be hands off.
---
This is mostly it, I was invited to a survivor party on PS4 when I solo qued and they talked about playing Killer as being a traitor when I brought up I was leveling Freddy for the rework and they lived to be toxic as possible and were constantly calling the killer trash.
---
I left shortly after that game. Didn’t want to play with those types of players.
---
Well, all Witches make pacts with demons for power, and odds are when they die their souls get sent to those demons. Maybe the Entity snatched away Bayonetta before Madame Butterfly could
---
Nah the developers have totally abandoned that game. It's dead.
---
Im gonna rope myself if they add jason and make him trash
---
The definition of holding the game hostage, according to BHVR, is that there's no way for the game to end. Trapping all the survivors in the basement permanently, would be holding the game hostage, whereas trapping a survivor in the basement for 2 minutes 30 until their RBT pops, is not holding the game hostage. Even trapping someone in the basement for the entire game until their teammates finish every gen and they get killed by the collapse, is not holding the game hostage. (of course no basement trapping is possible anymore, but you get the idea.)
---
That is not to say that those aren't dick moves. BHVR would rather people don't do the above (which is why it's not possible anymore), but none of them (except the first) are holding the game hostage, because no one is making it impossible for the game to end. 
---
What you list isn't holding the game hostage, it's just wasting time, which is lame but still entirely different.
---
Wrong, if they actually had a proper system in place other than just giving the killers more, they could make a good system around some hooks being perma sabotaged
---
Noed end game dabs with survivor salt. My favorite.
---
Hilarious. So you report people based on your own arbitrary grading system. You do realise the world does not revolve around you, and devs have already made it quite clear what is and isn't bannable? And nothing you listed is bannable. Keep crying.
---
Yeah, unfortunately, maaaaybe it will get fixed when/if they get their servers up.
---
Summer 2019 is the official window at the moment. They started testing the servers recently so I'd guess somewhere around the end of June or near the next mid-chapter patch
---
This is awful. I genuinely hope this is satire or a shitpost or something.
---
Can't tell if it sounds spookier in-game or on a bass. Either way, good job! Sounds cool :)
---
Best part is they will ban someone who accidentally glitched out the map before this guy
---
Happened to me yesterday, too. Had 1 gen left and the killer DCs, we lost all our points. There should be a system in place where you can still get points if this happens.
---
Poor Clem..
---
It's actually survivor oriented by design of the game. Most people who play are survivor players, like 1-2 of every 10 players is a sole killer main. There are so many more people who play survivor. You want proof, post any comment, ANY comment from the killer's point of view and you will be bombarded with dislikes.
---
So the game is catering to the larger player base. That's just how it is, because 1 person losing is a lot better than 4.

About time we have more office memes
---
Wraith I just find so fun to play. Especially  silent bell wraith with suppressed stain and TR
---
holding game hostage is when a game cannot end
---
I hope to god that’s satire
---
So let me get this straight he was ok with it only after you told him you don't play killer?
---
Fuck yeah
---
No for real, that was wasn't coming to a consensus, that was we're both on the same side
---
Gotta have silence when I'm playing killer, generally with headphones. Survivor I normally have s music playlist going.
---
I usually as survivor have music playing in the background at like 30-40% behind the game audio at like 60%
---
Hopefully Freddy will be reworked well, like Legion was.  
---
And thank fucking christ something is being done about MoM
---
Who is Bayonetta?
---
I watched a shirtless David disconnect as the nurse rounded on him, just noped out because he was hit. I was pissed because this dude hadn't really done much the whole game and to quit when it's just 2 survivors 1 gen left was so stupid. I got the last gen done and the nurse just kinda walked me out.
---
It's even worse on consoles because frame rate is just absolute shit
---
I either watch Netflix if I’m trying to just chill, or listen to soft music.
---
Yeah takes a few days and then you get compensated with a fuck ton of bloodpoints.
---
Read the eula and see for yourself. https://store.steampowered.com/eula/381210_eula_0
---
Okay but BHVR never had anything to do with him haha
---
Well every single pig brought noed before the nerf so
---
are you absolutely sure about that?
---
Yes.. haha the only person who promised he could make an announce was RJ because he told the kid a year ago that he could when it happened.
---
I really like using when I’m playing solo. If I’m with friends I don’t see the purpose of it since we can call out totem count. I think it’s underrated yet not always worth the perk slot.
---
I used to pick dark clothes right up until I earned that fly-ass new years dress
---
Why don’t you collect it? It gives you more chance of getting the perks you want AND it depletes the bloodweb faster by collecting the perk first
---
I cannot stand background noise in the background. I have no idea how people blast music!! I have to be aware of my surroundings in the game.  I get how people can listen playing survivor 
---
BUT HOW ON KILLER?  I guess because I play Spirit I’m meant to always be listening but still HOW
---
Clown:
---
Ruin
---
BBQ
---
Enduring
---
Spirit fury
---
Spirit:
---
Nurse's calling
---
Sloppy butcher
---
(you can also replace one of them for whispers
---
He even said he would leak information if enough people followed him.. like he’s just a scummy person.
---
This is gold
---
so you're saying 100% there was no off the contract agreement on this guy to announce something and now after fucking up since there's no legal trace bhvr acts like any other company?
---
Except good grades still hit you
---
A proud father.
---
Thank you both
---
I’m telling you 100% that this random kid has no contract, no interaction, and nothing to do with anything other than making friends with RJ Torbert on Twitter.
---
i give you 100% he wouldn't. 
---
he just wanted attention. that's as clear as anything. he was trying to hype up the community and get some internet points for it. it's sad that society came to this point but don't pretend it's something abnormal these days.
---
Happy cake day
---
ok Dwight
---
Don’t even have to be a low rank, corn is the worst obstacle in this game. It’s so easy to take advantage of how it fucks with LOS and POV.
---
Pretty much everytime I hit deadhard.
---
He mentions that people sent him death threats and harassed him terribly online... for what? What happened so badly with Ghostface that caused people to send HIM death threats? Everything he posts seems like attention and sympathy seeking to me. It all just doesn’t sit right with me.
---
I do and really want to take on the challenge of maining her, I find her mechanics wicked fun playing as or against her. But she is decent mid-late game and fairly weak at early pressure, which doesn't really compliment how I normally play as killer.
---
So it's been difficult and I've lost a lot, been shit-talked for it, felt like I'm back on day 1 of learning killer sometimes. And her emblem plus bloodpoint gains are woeful, so even in games where I play as well as it seems I can and 3-4K, I earn far less than I feel I worked for.
---
ah, then i believe and apologize and remove my comment. because i thought from contexts below they were friends and RJ promised the announcement and bhvr fucked up(cause they often do).
---
Disagree. Killer is in a weak state right now. Everyone just gen rushes faster than I can deal with, if I want any kills I have to run NOED.
---
Killers can run 4 unfun perks, survivors can run 16. This doesn’t start with killer.
---
A very simple band aid update that would make him a decent killer imo is if they just remove the fact that he gets slowed when he charges his chainsaw. Very simple and effective
---
Cool, endless no mither against a 115 killer.
---
Totems don’t take long and if you’re good enough you find the time and the totems. NOED is counterablw.
---
I'm the same as you and is why i was so surprised to hear that others could play with music and such, even as survivor stuff like the huntress lullaby/freddies rhyme is pretty quiet but so useful to hear
---
This gave me so much anxiety.
---
Throw in Unbreakable on a random 2 survivors and it’s a loss no matter what you do :(
---
I don’t think this is true. Noed is very strong with the endgame collapse and can be a reward for killing 3 players and finding the hatch first. However, most of the time, it rewards bad gameplay and allows you to get kills that you didn’t earn, and doesn’t incentivize you to get better. I try to play without noed in most of my games and it can be extremely frustrating. But it allows me to get marginally better at closing off loops and keeping pressure on survivors across the board. Don’t treat it as a foregone conclusion and let yourself realize that loss is the best teacher.
---
Any brain dead LF can facecamp. Why should noed change that
---
I play moatly survivor, and some killer. I bought headphones a few months after I started playing this game so I could hear things better. I never have any other background noise or music, but sometimes I'll talk to a friend while I play.
---
It just encourages it. He thinks, "Well i got noed so even if I miss my chainsaw or they got borrowed time nobody will save them because of noed so ill just camp."
---
There is going to be salt no matter what in a game like dbd. Both sides are riddled with entitled killer/survivor mains who think they deserve everything without the effort. Or there are the serial DCs. Just ignore the end game chat or block people who go out of their way to harass you.
---
Jango Theft
---
I appreciate this advice, but kindly save it for someone who doesn’t know how to play killer. I have 1,000+ hours in the game. I don’t run NOED because I want to. I’d love to run another perk, but nothing else will guarantee me a kill. An overwhelming majority of killers lack map control, added to the fact that half these maps are enormous and riddled with hiding spots. 
---
At this point all I can do is run an endgame build and rely on my killer mechanics. Survivors have all seemingly caught onto the fact that the faster you focus gens, the faster you get out. They can finish 2 gens before you make it across the map to find someone, and half the roster can do nothing about it.
---
I agree that it discourages learning and getting better. However, since the EGC allows hatch to spawn no matter what, I don’t really have a problem with a killer perk to reward bad gameplay because the survivors don’t even spend a perk slot for theirs
---
My god, what a specimen.
---
Why? I always find myself running into closed windows, I don’t run this perk, but it doesn’t seem like a hinderance.
---
This i can agree on. Give them another objective, but a optional one. They can get a few more bp or a few shards, sounds good to me.
---
I wanted to make it so perks don't activate if the killer is to close for 2 long
---
Don’t lose pips from DCing anymore I thought?
---
Never have background music. I'm not the best killer,but I rather hear than see them. Also as a survivor it's muvh easier to determine which way the killer comes from or goes to.
---
Way more fun than the iri king imo
---
You really put a watermark on this low quality ass meme? Lol
---
[removed]
---
Did anyone know who/what you where from ?
---
Honestly it's too necessary for a lot of killers. Unless You're a killer god, which most people aren't even those at the highest ranks, the weakes of killers need it. While yes, killers like Nurse, Billy, Spirit, Huntress don't really need it, and Bubba &amp; Myers have their own insta down mechanic, for everyone else, they suck. They're bad killers, wraith, legion, pig, etc. You play one of these and not go up against potatoes, you're gonna lose. No ed will give you that extra edge to actually make that killer capable at the very least, like playing Ruin.
---
Tldr
---
Low tier killers get "gen rushed" because they can't spread damage and apply pressure fast enough, so they use Noed as a way to balance it out.
---
June/July most likely June.
---
I have the Saw theme playing when I play Pig. Halloween theme for Myers and other than that silence.
---
Never going to happen.
---
Why the downvotes?
---
I like the TF2 font
---
Could we make it 5 per min in red ranks because that Queue time is to long
---
We have no way of knowing
---
The Shape's power is The Evil Within. He can stalk Survivors. The first chime is Tier Ii, the second is Tier III, where he can immediately down Survivors. Worse if he has a Tombstone piece equipped, meaning he can immediately kill you and eject you from the match.
---
I figured it out. If he manually leaves match, we still get our points. But if he ALT-F4s then no points or items are given back.
---
I'll be stabbed for Wendy.
---
Noed doesnt balance it though. Noed gives killers the power to end chases immediately, the ultimate camping ability, and makes some more powerful then they should be. I've seen too many times where my fate was decided by one fucking perk. One. One should not be enough to guarantee a kill. One should not make up for your mistakes. One should not save you because people are better then you. It doesn't matter what killer it is, they are KILLERS, they are meant to get you. But it should be a challenge. Just because the game is about over doesn't mean you should get an ability that is  usually locked by charge ups before that moment.
---
So quick question, if 3 survivors have a RBT on and you somehow trapped them in a room, and the 4th can still do a gen. Is that holding the game hostage or not? I mean I won't do it, but I wanna know how far you can push it according to the devs.
---

---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/a7hlid/trapper_issues_with_new_update/
---
bitch, please, tell me more of Trapper bugs, okay?
---
Personally my ranking goes:
---
Dream Warriors, New Nightmare, Original, Freddy's Revenge, Freddy's Dead, remake, Dream Master, Dream Child.
---
And the only ones I actually actively dislike are the last two, mostly because their stories make absolutely no sense on any level. And I'm the kind of person who wasn't too boggled by Freddy's Dead's Looney Toons shit. I'll give them that they had some of the best single sequences in the series though, like the cockroach and repeating in Dream Master or the comic world in Dream Child (sans Super Freddy).
---
I started playing him before I even touched the movies, funnily enough.
---
That's pushing it, but I believe it wouldn't technically count. Though I don't exactly know how it's considered when an end is possible but not ensured, like when the end will happen but only if a gen is completed. My example before about trapping people before the collapse even starts was also really pushing it, but it's more likely to happen if 3 people can still do gens than 1 person.
---
That said, I wouldn't be surprised if fringe cases like this were still punishable even if they aren't technically holding hostage.
---
It says "at least"
---
I was thinking about this too, but have the option to unhook them only on 1st hook, just like Deliverance.
---
Sometimes, you feel like you made a mistake and want to free that survivor.
---
Another example is when survivors fuck with you at hook, like going in the animation repeatedly until you go in 2nd phase and can't suicide because of that. That's when I would like to free the survivor and kill the others.
---
The best way to enjoy playing Trapper imo is to just place random traps in tall grass for no reason. I usually get at least two people trapped that way because they run around the map and only pay attention around the normal trapping spots.
---
But I also don't really try that hard.
---
Kinda sad, it was a pretty fun game. dbd is better but I still enjoyed f13
---
I think this is pushing it the hardest
---
You know what? I don't want to argue about this anymore. I got real world shit to deal with right now, don't know why I'm arguing over something in a game with some random stranger when it won't matter even tomorrow. 
---
Goodnight.
---
Played a game as Piggy and had one survivor teabag me with her trap on, refusing to remove it till it was active, and she farmed her team 5 times, so I hooked her, only to  see it was a fresh hook on the wrong person, \*Saw theme stats\*, and she didn;t save and just left.
---
It is supposed to be 2 and 2, the original poster is only right about one thing
---
Wait wait wait
---
We're you actually raging while writing all this XD

I thought you were a calm collected person trying to be objective about this, not some snowflake idiot.
---
Where is Nea?

Please leave me alone.
---
Comrade RyGuy giving his life for the betterment of the union.
---
The people HATE tekashi 69
---
Why... Why the Russian one?
---
I do that but unironically, often called "big brain" trapper, i trap loops but not the choke of the loops like the pallet or window, but instead a chokepoint on the loops usually around the outer edges, so lets say obstacle with pallet at point A and the other furthest point of that obstacle with no pallet is B, place it at B, they wont expect a trap there and wont be disarmed/activated when you dont want it to. 
---
Run this with Play with your Food and you can chase your obsession into a trap then turn your back on them, get your token and then hit spacebar to grab them from the trap which doesnt take a token, go to all this effort and you can sometimes be a C class killer :DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
---
Not a troll lol just calling you on some dumb bullshit, thats a dumb thing to say my dude. Dont be so dumb.
---
Why not the Russian one, comrade?

After all, *WE* sure do enjoy memes about ourselves, don’t *WE*?

“I really hope this reaches BVHR but I’m not going to post on official forums or bother linking it in my Reddit post, BVHR PLEASE READ”
---
Again, people don’t truly understand how long it takes to find totems and how big of a difference it makes, especially since you’re never sure if a killer has noed until someone gets instadowned
---
Killer is in the strongest state they have been in literally the entire history of DbD. I say this as a killer main, if you think killer is weaker than "before" you're just wrong
---
Totems usually spawn by generator spawns, if they don’t they’re in open dead spots. I’ll give it to you, some maps have shit spots, but rank 1, even up to 6, survivors will find them.
---
hope it reaches, by reaching out to other people who will also be vocal* might post on forum eventually but im lazy rn, not really the point of the post though is it
---
also, having max 4 loud noises in game which also is not guaranteed cause not everyone dcs and with that noise having easier game?.. how's that gamebreaking?
---
Nobody said killer is weaker. Survivors literally just get stronger by adaptation. I don’t see how killer being in it’s strongest state changes the fact that survivor is still stronger???
---
Can we also straight-up delete Cow Tree from the game files? It has no reason to exists and means every Coldwind map besides Rotten Fields has at least 3 God-loops.
---
No thats not true. You coul only drop a survivor 3 times, after picking him up he would then break free, so you could only dribble them for a very short distance.
---
Don't know why you think thats invalid, even if you have no say about your teammates perks they are still there and make a killers job harder. So if survivor perks were on par with killer perks it would be unbalanced.
---
Yes, finishing a gen or when the killer breaks something is situational (or sparse). Picking someone on the ground means at least someone is downed and another one is locked in place healing him, so two out of 4 survivors are out of the main objective while the perk works. Kindred needs you to be on the hook to work, is that not punishing enough to you?
---
Yes, the killer has more aura reading abilities, and ones that help him more than survivors, thats what i meant when i said killer need stronger perks.
---
20% extra healing speed is useless to you? Tell that to the people that like to use botany for the extra 33%. If you ran an altruistic build you could get above 50% healing speed and if you bring a medkit you'd probably be the MVP against every M1 killer.
---
"killer is in a weak state right now" - you right before you just told me killer is in its strongest state ever
---
It doesn't really matter at which point in the game the LF is camping at. Your response should always be the same and that's to do the objective. If it's early and mid game, do the generators. You can pop the majority before the first person dies, unless that person is dumb and kills themself. If it's the late game, either find the totem or just leave. Not everybody needs to make it out.
---
They aren’t mutually exclusive. In comparison to different builds, yes this game is the most killer friendly it’s ever been. That, however, doesn’t change the fact that the game is still survivor sided.
---
I think the survivors a pre-made. How does Jane a talk show Moderator or shit end up with a old ancient Priest? Like it makes no sense. Jane just fell asleep and woke up in the entitys realm. Like less creativity isnt even possible.
---
I agree with this; yeah killers are in their strongest state, but survivors are still stronger
---
It probably always will be. It has been for the entire history of the game thus far. No offense, but if that's your chief complaint about the game, you're beating a dead horse. Good killer players are able to do fine on almost any killer in the game.
---
As survivor it's pretty okay to play with music or background noise since perks like Spine Chill just light up and you know what to do, and the rest is just not missing skill checks, but as killer it might be difficult since killers need to listen out for gens and injured people and all that.
---
I just got her yesterday and I kinda regret it beacuse I suck. Any tips I don't really know where to place my traps.
---
You’re right. Legion was just rushed game design that made him pretty bad to play (against). Now he’s still kinda meh in that regard since he’s just a regular M1 killer after he frenzies. I like Plague though.
---
And yeah, I would have loved to see a cabin in the forest map from Evil Dead. Imagine if BHVR perfectly captured the interior of the cabin for us to play in. It seems like wasted potential as you said.
---
When a tombstone Myers gets to tier 3
---
Eh, works both ways. You can have it a s a crutch or have it as a "win more perk" with strong killers, i mean nobody can stop you, wo why not run it on Billy or Nurse.

I can't believe you got downvoted while the original post gets over 1000 upvotes lol. This sub is really dogshit sometimes

It would be too similar perks, bad game design.

exactly. jeffs story and character lines up pretty well with legion. kate and clown are both performers, and clown happens to be a fast bastard with the hots for girls like kate. adam and spirit, i guess they're both in japan, idk. but jane and plague, just felt abysmal. i appreciate the emphasis on wanting to make the gameplay better for plague, but still. its unfinished seams really show
---
Don't go into matches expecting 4 gens to get repaired, as you want to defend as many as possible.
---
That being said, it's always a good idea to find a good 3-gen cluster and push Survivors elsewhere.
---
Afaik, this was a joke.
---
I'm a survivor main and I agree. It would be so easy for me to give in and be toxic to all killers because of the times I get tunneled, camped or slugged, but that wouldn't help anything. Instead of getting mad and tbagging or trash-talking I just move on and hope to have a more fun match. 
---
If I notice they do that to be annoying and incite reactions from people though, well, there's MLGA for that.

---
Balance issues aside if you can avoid hook hugging then that's the best gameplay for all. However yes some games m1 killers just can't do much unfortunately, but it's rather sad when nurses/billies tryhard camp and slug when it's easy to 4k with those.
---
"Devs are killer sided" Alrighty then!
---
14 seconds of your time isn't a hindrance if it prevents NOED. You also get BP for doing them. Only one survivor needs to do two totems. The surface area of 4 survivors covers more of the map than any one killer. Four sets of eyes to scout out totems and cleanse them for all of 14 seconds.
---
The whole threat of NOED forces people to stop working on gens (for A WHOLE 14 SECONDS, OH NO) and work on totems. The only other distraction in the game are chests and maybe sabotaging hooks (if you really want to go out of your way to waste time). There are only 6 minutes and 40 seconds of generator time. It's very possible to have sub 12 minute games as a survivor unless you're running with potatoes. 
---
People on this subreddit are either playing rank 20 or the appearance of NOED is completely overblown. Figure out what perks the killer is running and count to four. If you can count to four, you don't need to do totems, congrats! But finding out that a killer has NOED isn't gameruining, just annoying. If people would stop throwing themselves at the killer while exposed, NOED wouldn't be as useful. You don't need to count to four when it concerns the number of survivors that actually get to escape. If you are, that's on you and not a perk that should have never procced to begin with.
---
It's not about being sensitive. I barely play killer and even I know that's an asshole thing to do.
---
But okay, lmao
---
Do you know how unlucky you have to be to get this situation anyways. This only work on a specific map IF the basement spawns in MB, in which case. Don’t go down near MB
---
&gt; Feelsbad when I cleanse 3 or 4 totems when I play survivor and the randoms cleanse none. 
---
Shouldn't you be blaming your randoms and not the killer running the perk? You know the perk is counterable, that's why you're doing totems. It's a 1v4 game. You're part of a team. And when your team fails you, that's really not the killer's doing.
---
Killers can’t body block the basement stairs now, they removed it in the most recent patch. 
---
This is the only time you can be blocked down there and it’s due to the small entrance and not the stairs themselves.
---
*says in samination’s trapper voice*

I leveled up Claud to 50 because of at that time my mates told me that she's the noob friendly character as ya know "self care" but then... Then something happend
---
I found my love, my one and only FENG
---
Andddddd I just play her with her bright blue shirts and also because alert is one of the best  killer tracking perks I've seen in game.
---
Alert, lithe, adrenaline and quick and quiet is so good.
---
DS and MoM shouldn't increase a chase by 4 minutes. That's what looping does. If you got looped for 4 minutes by the last survivor, that's because you don't know how to counter loop. 
---
I suggest finding the hatch before, and trying to bait the survivor you're chasing close to or near the hatch. If you're sucessful, you can hook them and easily get to hatch before they die (hatch opens) and kick it shut. Most people who camp hatch are insanely clsoe to it, so if you shut it, there's a really good chance you're going to see them run. If not, they're at a door, and with end-game goodluck getting anyone of the doors open by yourself.
---
Granted this is if they don't have key. Focus on key mains first without tunneling, or run something like franklins.
---
Do you ever feel like sometimes people really don't get the killer idea? Cuz I do
---
The killer is body blocking here. He's stalling the game with no way out for the other players besides a dc.
---
Ah my bad thought he couldn't get down there and was dropping someone off his shoulder.
---
Guys, he’s referencing Dead Meat. Why the downvotes?
---
5/10 to much water, not enough shirtless myers !
---
Waiting for EGC to kill survivors is not holding the game hostage..
---
I'm playing 98% solo and I've so often been called SWF cancer sh*t, it's not even funny.
---
Not gonna lie, that colonel would be dope.
---
Could have a survivor in a chicken suit.
---
Also that wendy is hot.
---
But MEg has a Runner Butt and the leggins man ! THE LEGGINGS !
---
I like any idea to remove the extra grind. As a newer player with less than hours of game time, it feels very tedious to RNG grind perks for new killers. In a game I already paid for. Normally in a paid game, with paid DLCs, the grind shouldn't be as hardcore as something free to play dont ya think.
---
Thank
---
It depends on your playstyle. Also, an immersed playstyle isn't worse than an aggressive one. People just misuse an immersed playstyle and end up wasting a lot of time.
---
In the Soviet Union were not only Russian. Although it does not matter here, but still.
---
It is meant to be used to avoid the killer when they get close. Just because people misuse it doesn't make it "placebo-garbage". I don't run it too often but it is a pretty good perk.
---
&gt;I think this is unneccessary because survivors have very few perks which are actually good perks. These are adrenaline, borrowed time, self care, dead hard, sprint burst, unbreakable and mettle of man.
---
Also Ironwill, Spine Chill, Balanced Landing, Decisive Strike, Lithe, Urban Evasion, Bond, Lightweight, and Deliverance.
---
&gt;Killers have alot of good perks and some of them are too good in my opinion.
---
Killers are generally more reliant on good perks and add-ons. 
---
&gt;Mettle of Man can be compared to Spirits Fury. Mettle of Man needs to be charged up just like spirit fury and their effect is kinda similar. mettle of man is one time use but spirits fury is unlimited use. 
---
I mean, at least Spirit Fury has some counterplay. Once you know the killer has it, drop pallets early or avoid them altogether. As far as I'm aware, Mettle of Man lacks counterplay.
---
&gt;My point is that survivors perks are 70% trash and useless perks and when survivor get one perk which is actually good then DbD devs are going to nerf this instantly. Its so ridicolous that killer mains are crying when survivors have also good perks just like killers do. Probably gonna quit the game if they nerf mettle of man. These devs are too killer sided and want to destroy survivors experience by nerfing all good perks and so on.
---
The devs are trying to balance the game. Try playing against a four-man SWF running Adrenaline, Dead Hard, Decisive Strike, and Mettle of Man. It's incredibly difficult to secure kills.
---
Removed for salty after game chat

What if there was a toggle on Pharmacy where you could choose which green item you want to receive?
---
I used to alternate multiple Hag pun names until I settled on this one, now I just run the Cult of the Hag in my off time and create mud traps in my backyard.

Unless you don't care about getting too many kills, sometimes I set multiple traps just for the jump scare and let them all escape.
---
&gt; after being in a lobby with 3 others wearing the exact same outfit, I said fuck it, i use brighter clothes on her
---

---
Urban Evasion and Lightweight are shit perks lol
---
Out of curiosity, exactly how much killer do you play? Especially low mobility killers like Wraith, Pig, Freddy, Trapper, etc who already have problems downing survivors quickly? The problem with MoM is that it has no counterplay and it punishes the lower tier killers more than the higher tier ones, just making the Nurse, Hillbilly, Spirit, etc, even more prevalent than they already were.
---
Because people are dumb and dont get the reference. Upvoting to help
---
There is. It's just not like the spirit or the legion, but there is a cooldown. You just want every killer you don't like facing to get nerfed.
---
I hope you're serious
---
Except it wouldn't. People face camp successfully with wraith. It doesn't. Matter.
---
I use Botany with it. 2 guaranteeded heals with some charges still left to wake up against Freddy a couple of times.
---
*DC noise*
---
Or u can play killer
---
Knees weak arms are heavy
---
I sometimes throw that on either with only pharmacy or also with ace, but some people would probably consider that a waste of perk slots.
---
Why do we even need post-game chat?
---
Being a "killer main" doesn't make any difference. Compared to other killers, Bubba is F tier. And the F is for face camping.
---
I think it’s this map and the Thompson house map, they both have tiny door ways at the top of the stairs.
---
Yeah i was thinking the same thing
---
This is awesome. Also Dwight looks hot, I could see him as Dewey.
---
As a priestess, the plague had followers
---
As a host of her own show, Jane has fans
---
That's what they have in common
---
No it isn't. Bubba will down you both. The unhook animation and recovery is too long. I don't what kind of blind ass Leatherbillies you've played against but this isn't typical.
---
That’s an Identity V mindset right there
---
Jane is too THICC, she can't even hide for 2 seconds.
---
The ever elusive sensible argument. Thank you for not being an idiot.
---
I get bad luck with Ace. I got an Abdominal Dressing alone once so it screwed me out of two heals and 4 games in a row I got the same addon that slightly decreases skill check difficulty. I would've been content with bandages honestly as I could've healed 3 times. I did get a Gel Dressing and Gauze Roll once, which is awesome for 5 heals for yourself and teammates.
---
It's suppose to be a 2 kills and 2 escapes in a balanced match. But of course there are 4 kills or 4 escapes matches, it's impossible to not be.
---
If you play like an asshole I’ll call you on it.
---
Hope Ofc
---
Larrys
---
Yes, a couple of times. It was down to luck that it either spawned near me or I saw it before the last person died though.
---
her and clown dosen't get the love they deserve
---
I’m about on that edge too. I generally don’t enjoy killer. The only killer I ever do enjoy is Freddy because I got decent with him. Now my main perk (Remember Me) isn’t as useful, and he’s getting reworked. Between the same assshole strategies from the same 5  (character wise not player) killers, bug everywhere, bad luck (I’m a ducking magnet for it), and complete garbage or asshole teammates....it’s just really hard to have any kind of fun anymore. Endgame has also seemed to just make it 1000x worse. I genuinely love this game (or did I guess) and I’d hate to have to quit because it’s really all I play right now...but it’s just getting to the point where I never enjoy myself.
---
The thing is, survivor perks need to be balanced by the thought that there could be 4 of them in one match vs a killers 1 perk. Having the killers perks be slightly overpowered in a game like DBD is basically necessary as you have 4 opponents which nearly always have 3 doing something productive while you chase one. If the killers and survivors perks are balanced on the same level then, the game is a cake walk for survivors and torture for killers.
---
It takes time to learn this but, guy who died was right. It was your fault, all 3 of you. 
---
If you plan on helping out someone who is still in the trial being chased or camped, **NEVER** heal by the exit gates or sit by the exit gates because its safe and you can "bait" the killer while not in actual risk of getting caught. The killer will just come and push you out. 
---
You got hit while trying to save? Run somewhere safe **inside the map** to heal, like an area with pallets remaining or a window structure. 
---
So many times I performed saves against a campy killer by not running towards the exit gates and twice that amount of time, I was the one hooked only watching my teammates being "pushed out".
---
Does people actually think the "nea = killer" jokes are funny? No offense to you op but this "joke" is just really annoying and was never really creative
---
Fuck you.
---
Wat?! The hatch is suppose 2 be survivor sided, closing the hatch is killer sided.  If killer finds it ur dead, all the killer has 2 do is patrol 2 exit gates that he always knows where they r n gets a notification when ur almost done!! Plus on some maps there so close the killer can sit in 1 spot and watch both gates!! N I wouldn't call it a fighting chance more like a slim chance.  Im not salty about it I even said I like closing the hatch I just want it made more fair.  Open an exit gate, give them 2 me at 50%, or even increase opening speed a little.
---
You’ve really outdone yourself this time, OP
---
wraith and pig  are some of the lowest tier killers, literally just using your mouse to look around is effective enough to counter their no terror radius
---
My aim was to heal the dude so we could both work together for save because it was billy, if I got chainsawed during the unhooking animation it'd be helping no one. At least with another healthy survivor, chainsaw does take a while so even if he gets one of us, the other one can unhook and easily dodge another chainsaw, or take a hit without going down. End game has started, we have one who bailed when I got hit and the other dude's some clauds that was MIA the whole game. The only logical move I could make was to bail, because to the killer, I'm the easy target if he wanted a 2nd kill, the other clauds was still MIA and not unhooking. True we could've picked a better spot to heal but even so, with end game already counting down on us, doubt we could've made it out any better, it's just a matter of who dies in the end.
---
But they nerfed her so you can hear glass breaking if she's phasing
---
Jane and Plague both act as a source of inspiration for their followers.
---
You also missed that Rin also wanted to become a teacher, like Adam was.
---
C'mon man, you're making the lore seem worse than it is.
---
With edit
---
I shouldn't be saying this because I'm a spirit main but the best thing you can do is just run the fuck away and try to mind game when you know she's phasing. Don't try to go back over the pallet and definitely don't try walking around an unsafe loop. If it's a shitty loop for you then I can just see which way you go and smack your face. If it's a good loop then you can get some distance and force me to either break the pallet or phase at you which gives you a second to disappear.
---
if i got all categories almost maxed out, i did something in all of them
---
It doesn't exist a best perk build, there are a lot of perk builds which can work wonderful. 
---
This is one : Decisive Strike, Unbreakable, Deliverance, Dead Hard
---
Or another one : Adrenaline, Hope, Balance Landing, Decisive Strike.

I would make it longer but there’s not much mor I can do unless I can hear the entire song and transpose the rest.
---
Really smooth animations. BHVR has done a great job with these. 
---
Can't say the same about opening an exit gate as a killer.
---
The type of people who camp usually don’t care about bloodpoints or winning. They either do it out of ignorance or to annoy you, either way making it more difficult to camp won’t stop them doing it
---
Severely crippling camping will only affect the people who stay near the hook after the gates are open, and those who are facing survivors who bum rush the hook
---
Camping sucks, it really does, but imo it’s more of a people problem than a game mechanic problem
---
Why
---
I saw his vid and panda’s. Really badass outfit.
---
she's so boring, mediocre perks, mediocre power, not enjoyable at all
---
He prob tried to squeeze past it.
---
She is a crazy killer, that's right. But she still takes practice, good tracking and good prediction. Good survivors can confuse you by manipulate scratch marks or by using Iron Will, which is a strong perk against Spirit. But she can out playing even the best survivors, you need just an understanding on her power and on how survivors react against you. She really isn't to easy to play, especially against good survivors, but you will see that against good survivors, she's better than Billy. 
---
The best perks on her are tracking perks ( BBQ, A Nurse's Calling, Surveillance, Discordance, Deerstalker, Rancor ), stall perks ( Ruin, Pop Goes The Weasel, Sloppy Butcher ) or instant down perks ( Make Your Choice, Haunted Ground, Devour Hope, even NOED ).
---
As add-ons, I recommend charge time + speed add-ons or double charge time, you don't need more than brown or yellow add-ons on her, but you can always use green, purple or red add-ons if you really want to try hard on her.
---
You don't even know how his power is going to work yet.

Totally makes sense that crouching INCREASES your hitbox :D

This is some whiteknighting at it's best.

Lol, I'm a new player and CI is my ghetto ruin because I haven't leveled up hag yet
---
Not intending for something and calling it "cheating" are two very different things.
---
She just seems... so powerful
---
In hindsight I would've changed it to 'IM ONLY HAVING FUN IF YOURE NOT GOT IT?'
---
Just healing yourself increases your hit box, crouching not.
---
I think people don't play clown because 1. He is not challenging to play or brokenly good and 2. His design is pretty damn creepy so it might drive people away. 3. Nothing is really note worthy for him he is just a fat clown that's fingers unlike a deformed hillbilly with a chainsaw a Doctor with those eye thingies and a tall guy with a bell made from his boss

Hah, thank you! The VVitch is seriously one of the best modern horror films I've ever seen. Black Phil just added to the, "what the fuuuck?" creep factor.

---
I believe it was ardethas Because of a tournament he was practicing for that's happening today
---
That's awesome thanks Bro! Could you do a killers perspective maybe?
---
That removes tension for Survivors and satisfaction for Killers.
---
Honestly, the reason why I don't face-camp isn't to be fair. It's just not smart to sit in one place for long compared to pressuring the map all-around.
---
Though this is toxic as, it actually made me laugh haha
---
From the videos i watched, i truly don’t understand how they are able to know which way survivors will go in a jungle gym especially when they can’t even see scratch marks, it’s like magic to me but i’m excited to learn. Also can you see auras while phasing?
---
Not true at all in my opinion.
---
First of all, unless you play full SWF, everyone at some point is going to waste some amount of time trying to save the survivor. Even good survivors will, because they have to find out their teammate is 100% being camped before they give up on them. There is also slowdown perks that will further allow the killer to get at least 2 kills.
---
Secondly, 3 people cannot rush 5 gens in 1 hook unless the survivor who got camped put on a good chase to start.
---
Also, the fact that the new ranking system more often then not caused campers to depip or black pip means they stay low rank, and get rewarded more often because they play worse survivors.
---
Lastly, Killers still get a respectable amount of BP just for camping despite the BP punishments, which many people don't even realize. 
---
It just annoys me that the devs actually haven't taken any real drastic measures to making camping worse, or find a way to remove it at all. Nobody enjoys camping at all besides the campers themselves, but the devs have failed to address this for 3 years.
---
I don't have music for the fact you can miss important sounds if you do.
---
Instead of unhooking them,if you want them to live maybe you shouldn't hook them in the first place.
---
yes fu dbd devs. ya'll suck. I get camped every day
---
Bubba, lol
---
Bugs will get fixed and they are looking to fix legions animation to not look as slow.
---
Damn, I wish this blew up more, I want more people to see Rab Witch!!
---
*legion comes in*
---
*smooth criminal plays*
---
It's just prediction and practice, after a while, you will understand how survivors react and try to juke, so you will be able to predict and get them. 
---
No, auras don't work when you are phasing, but you can use auras to pin point survivors locations and phasing at them. But, you can see the locations from Rancor while are you phasing ( because Rancor don't show auras, it shows locations ), and that's why Rancor is so good on her. And charge time + speed add-ons help you against good survivors, because they have less time to juke you if you have these add-ons. Mother Daughter Ring + Bloody Hair Brooch is OP in the hands on a good Spirit.
---
As a killer, it can get rather annoying to get looped over and over. I know that's the point.
---
Suviviors that DC are just bitches

Yes, I will in fact main Ghostface, how did you know that??

You're just minding your business, doing skills checks on a gen and suddenly there is a *tap tap tap*, the sound of someone running, but it is much faster than any human could run. Around the corner, in the distance, you see her turn a corner towards you. It's Rab Witch season

Clown is a low-mid tier killer with a very basic power, nobody plays him because they get gen rushed with him very easy, personally I take the nerfed Pig over Clowny Boy. And that's says something.

Are you living under a rock or you frequent this sub without actually playing the game?

Myers and Freddy can have a really low terror radius

---
I haven't played the game in a long while. Maybe tone the unnecessary aggression down.
---
I didn't say they are the same thing, i said that the way i end up using clown (played as him a few times with my friend's account) i get the same effrct as doctor
---
Too broad of a question. 
---
Some people consider a win as only killing all four, despite pipping. 
---
Others consider winning as killing a certain annoying survivor, even if they do nothing else all game. 
---
Winning is weird in this game and needs context. I can kill all four players and not pip. I can only kill 1 and pip. 
---
A winner implies that there is a loser, but everybody can pip in a game. Most people think they won if they pipped.
---
Its the end game collapse. When the hatch is closed or the gates are opened, survivors have to gtfo or else they die. this video explains it better:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqGzYaiiMlY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqGzYaiiMlY)
---
When I play killer DCs don’t usually annoy me at all :0 I always just find it funny that this person was so distraught about whatever I did that they couldn’t bear to play the remainder of a 20 - 30 minute game.
---
Then you are playing him wrong they have two different playstyles IMO and one is actually good in chases.
---
Endgame Collapse is a new feature in DBD, where the killer can now close the hatch, starting a two minute timer which slows down when a survivor is dying or hooked. The timer can also be triggered by opening one of the exit gates.
---
When the timer expires, all survivors in the match will be killed, counting towards sacrifices for the killer.
---
Thanks for your answer. I'm new to DBD and I'm only R16 as a killer and forgot all about the pip system. Really never paid attention to it. This reminds me I should probably educate myself on that lol.
---
In the time is takes for a survivor to be fully sacrificed in one hooking, you can get 3 full generators done.  
---
If the survivor put up a good chase then you've got your 5 gens done no problem.
---
A killer wont get a respectable amount of BP for this scenario either, as they aren't getting points for chases, gen protection, etc.
---
Caring about the killer getting pips in this situation is just petty, and stupid.  
---
If they killer wanted to de-pip they'd just de-pip.  
---
In the end it doesn't matter what the Devs do, bad behaviour will still exist, you can't ban people for camping, and trying to get rid of it via gameplay/reward changes will just hurt normal play.  
---
I can also tell you, I've camped a lot, and I've never enjoyed it.  
---
I camp when the survivor has been a total prick and deserves to lose hard and it's the only way to deal with such survivors who are toxic.  
---
Put them on the hook, limit their ability to get bloodpoints for themselves, punish them for their actions such as teabagging etc.  
---
It's not enjoyable, but I'll gladly take a hit to my killer score to make sure a toxic survivor leaves with nothing.
---
Mate calm down. He was asking a question ffs. You could've actually answered it instead of being a Dick.
---
One hit downs on a m1 killer arent very good. Thats why myers even in t3 isnt all that dangerous, because you still get looped
---
where's the nerf for that? oh wait devs suck killer dick and will probably buff it lol my bad
---
Oh, man, really? Lucky. My whole experience was downright horrendous.
---
In my opinion I count a win as killer as 2-3 kills or if everyone had fun idk about survivor as I only played them for about 10 hours.
---
id say the same but you already disconnected
---
Billy stomps vs most players that don't know how to loop.
---
Spirit, Hag, Huntress are all better vs good players.
---
I really hope we gonna get the exit gate animations for killers in the next update.
---
Hex: no one escapes head
---
Does DbD have slabs? No. Did it have lanterns that killers &amp; survivors alike would kill for? Yes
---
Clown is just boring. There is very little you can do with him, so not a lot of people play him.
---
You throw the bottle at one end of the loop and go to the other, they get slowed by the gas so they need to throw the pallet faster.
---
That's all of Clown's gameplay.
---
I just base it on points for myself.
---
As survivor any BP over 20K means I most probably had a good game so I don’t care if I die so long as I don’t de-pip.
---
As killer any BP over 25K means I did well and got lots of hooks in even if they all escape. Again i’m happy with that outcome so long as I don’t de-pip. But I normally aim for 2 dead at the end anyway.
---
Imo some form of kindred should just be a passive all survivors get, to make saves against campers easier. 
---
And I will agree campers get way too many bloodpoints for what they do, but nerfing that won’t stop them. Most campers don’t care about winning or points, unless they’re ignorant in that camping isn’t optimal play (Unless gates are open)
---
The main issue I find is that survivors CAN get at least three gens done in the time it takes the hooked person to die, but of course they have to know the person’s being camped. Some form of kindred should just be a passive effect, as I said, so there’s more opportunity for counterplay
---
Three gens is more than enough punishment for camping - the pressure of having more survivors than gens cannot be overestimated
---
Why you did that ? Coldwind even were nerfed last patch.
---
Once again, spirit is best
---
None of them isn't good in chases to be fair.
---
Billy always had that map control and ohko tho, and that's what's always made him top tier
---
Oh really ? I couldn't tell with me dying 70% of my matches lol.
---
Seriously though, I'm not a competitive person at all and I really don't care about surviving or not. But I paid for the game (well, PAYING for it since I play on ps4) and I'd like to be able to play at least a little bit and earn a decent amount of bloodpoints. That's why I hate campers so much. I don't care about dying, but if you're preventing me from playing and wasting my time, go fuck yourself.
---
On a side note, I've never considered dbd a horror game. I know it's supposed to be, but compared to other horror games I've played, it's never been scary for me. You can't expect us to "fear" the killer when they're just another human being. However, I agree with the respect part. Every player should respect each other, respect goes both ways.
---
Trump memes are S tier
---
As survivor, either escaping (obviously) or a fun game.
---
As long as I am enjoying myself I don't care if I die. I often demand that the killer hooks/kills me if I had a fun game with a respectable killer.
---
Some killers require different builds.
---
For Trapper, Wraith, Doctor, Pig, Plague, Legion, Myers, Leatherface &amp; Freddy the current meta build is BBQ, Ruin, Enduring and Spirit fury.
---
Myers can also be run pretty well with BBQ, Ruin, Monitor &amp; Abuse and either Whispers or Enduring. It lets you take advantage of his small terror radius.
---
Clown can either go BBQ, Ruin, Enduring and spirit fury, or BBQ, Ruin, Brutal strength and Whispers. The 2nd build lets you kick pallets faster since vs him survivors will often throw the pallet early.
---
Spirit's meta build is BBQ, Ruin, Nurse's calling and Sloppy buther, or you can replaye sloppy and nurse's for whispers and make your choice.
---
Hag's build is pretty flexible, she doesn't really need to use BBQ as she's more focused on securing one area of the map, but everyone wants points so you usually run bbq. Other than that you can use Ruin, Make your choice, haunted grounds, monitor and abuse, sloppy butcher.
---
Billy is the only 115% ms killer that doesn't need Ruin, as his power allows him to have a lot of map pressure. With him you go BBQ, Enduring and spirit fury. The 4th perk is up to you, I like using Whispers, brutal strength, monior and abuse.
---
Huntress goes BBQ, Ruin, Whispers and Nurse's calling. I like taking enduring instead of nurse's coz the survivor never expects it.
---
Nurse has the most perk flexibility due to her power. BBQ and Whispers are really good. A lot of nurses take Shadowborn to track people during blinks more easily. Nurse is the main user of Infectious fright, as her main weakness is stealth. It's really easy to snowball with Infectious fright on her.
---
For survivor there is a lot of options. I'd recommend making sure to have 1 exhaustion perk in your build no matter what. If you think your teammates are competent and you will get to 5 gens, take Adrenaline.
---
I heavily recommend Borrowed time as tunneling is rampant.
---
Hold on imma mindgame ironworks window real quick
---
Somebody once posted a mock-up someone made that was Legion skins for all the original survivors.  I wish we could have gotten that, as like the entity had gotten to their minds and some versions of themselves got warped in to killers.
---
Happy cake day!
---
Wraith isent that op. But if youd like id recommend using the perk "Spine Chill" and it will notify you when the killer is facing your direction. Which means if its a wraith coming to get you, youll be notified if the killer is coming and you can already be prepared for him or any other no heartbeat killers.
---
They can only window vault 3 times. It can be mind gamed and beaten fine.
---
He is considered one of the weakest killers. He is not fast, he is 115% killer when unclocked but after unclocking he has a 1 second sprint. So if you see the glimmer while he walks or you hear the footsteps, then run near a window. Spine Chill helps.
---
Spine Chill and premonition are both good. Spine chill is better because it has no cooldown unlike premonition. 
---
Wraith is still loopable, he does do very well against beginner survivors and falls behind against a good chaser survivors. 
---
I remember when the game came out I would complain Wraith is OP because I couldn't see him and he always had a jump on me. He since got buffed and I think Wraith was well overdue with the update.
---
Shirtless Kate is what we really need
---
**For Survivors**:
---
Win: Didn't have to leave someone to die to get out (unless the killer is facecamping or has instant-downs).
---
Alternatively: Did leave someone to die, but unhooked at least one person who also escaped.
---
Doesn't count survivors dying in general, if there are survivors dead before the gates are powered then it's still a win.
---
Additionally: Leaving a survivor to die because of Blood Warden is a win; you do have to account for Killer perks like BW as much as you would NOED.
---
Lose: Open the hatch with a key prior to gates being powered (though the killer closing the hatch powers the gates, so feel free to reopen it without it being a loss).
---
Lose: Leave multiple people behind. Most of the time you can unhook one of two people hooked and get out if you opened the gate first.
---
Lose: Have to crawl out (gate or hatch). Doesn't count if the killer's hit knocked you into escaping.
---
Lose: Lowest score out of the survivors without getting farmed or facecamped/tunneled.
---
Lose: If you died.
---
**For Killers**:
---
Win: Survivor uses a key to escape through hatch prior to gates being powered.
---
Win: Last survivor uses hatch to escape.
---
Win: 8 hooks, 2 kills, a pip.
---
Win: Really anything more than two kills, up to four.
---
Sort-of-win: The teabagger got rehooked in 40 seconds despite BT+DS.
---
Lose: Staying near a hooked survivor without being in a chase (facecamping).
---
Lose: Depipping.
---
Lose: Stepping in your own fucking trap while carrying a survivor like a total potato, unless the trap auras are not working (they often don't, so take this with a grain of salt).
---
Lose: Not slugging vs. sabo groups.
---
Lose: **Not getting all four stacks of BBQ.** (This is the worst one, even if you don't kill anybody, get those stacks).
---
Low terror radius is liyteky Micheals entire power pretty much. He doesn't get much else from it until 3
---
Why didnt they keep clowns old hatch close where he bends down and does it
---
u/titletoimagebot
---
It’s been 179 days come back ;(((
---
How does it give tracking?
---
When a survivor thinks you are farming but you actually have tombstone
---
No, not bannable. Just annoying to go through.
---
Suviviors vomit when they are broken so you can listen for it. Also if you infect objects and they get infected
---
I think I remember he was rank 17 or 18. This was a few days after rank reset
---
the wiki is up to date you genius and even if it wouldnt be, have you tried thinking about a reason they should Change that? No? well stop writing stupid things
---
Oh I see. Still think she's underpowered. I feel like they could've done something to make her a bit better
---
-rep killed me before anyone else.
---
-rep tunneled me (last person to die)
---
-rep tryhard killer
---
-rep killed me even though my SWF DC'd
---
-rep toxic killer kept finding me after hooking someone
---
-rep somehow always knew where I was healing
---
-rep saw me in a bush even though I was Claudette
---
-rep hit me even though I used Dead Hard
---
-rep lag switcher (literally everyone else in the lobby has 40 to 60 ping but they had 300)
---
-rep hacker always landed their blinks as Nurse
---
Anyone else have anything else that you'd expect? I don't actually have all those but I do have some similar ones lol
---
Damn. I play Doctor sometimes. Is that really why?
---
I hate that the sandbagging Claudette is me
---
If you’re healing your hitbox goes slightly up so the hatch can just go above your head and it’ll still hit you. Learned that from ScottJund
---
idk, i never disconnect cos it pisses me off when my teammates do it, but i really find doctor unenjoyable to play against
---
OH FUCK RUNNING HURTS
---
\&gt; A survivor being "toxic" doesn't even make sense. Tbagging, flashlighting and gesturing  
---
Doing all those things then auto-dcing the second you're downed is toxic and shitty. It ruins the game for everyone. DCing whenever things don't go your way is toxic and shitty. It ruins the game for everybody. You wanna complain about a player getting tunneled, something that largely happens because of bad luck/play/teammates on the survivors behalf then completely ignore survivors dcing for shit as stupid as "you got downed ten seconds into the match" "Killer choose character you don't like" "You tebagged at every pallet and now you're all embarrassed you got caught" like it doesn't fuck the game for everyone?
---
I main killer and I don't care about the quitter bonus. It sucks to play against a team crippled three minutes in over a fucking crybaby. Tunneling can be countered, rage quitting babies can't.
---
You clearly have no idea how to play her or use her power correctly. Her power has utility built in with aoe ranged downs and insta downs. It doesn't take that long to apply broken if you can aim correctly since it builds up on its own too.
---
I get that. His power just let's you find survivors and slows the game
---
Can confirm this. I was wearing the head in a KYF with my boyfriend, who had no add-ons. About 30% of the time, it'd trigger but on a significant delay (like I could spin in circles around it and it'd trigger about 5 seconds late,) and the other 70%, it wouldn't trigger at all.
---
I mean... All my stuff is shot but you can never know :/
---
Just use M&amp;A
---
Oh yeah, definitely check along the walls in Swamp. Hatch spawns there a lot too.
---
yeah that’s fair. thinking about it, on paper his power is good at what it does and is balanced, but i just struggle to find enjoyment in games against a doctor. maybe as i get better at the game i’ll enjoy it a bit more idk
---
This needs to be Tier 3 walking animation... I'm! Comin! For! Dat! Booty!
---
I personally like devour hope, but ruin is good since gens go so quickly
---
Fucking *died* at hyper bubba
---
Why exactly?
---
Guess that Im really unlucky than after P3'ing Legion and Huntress and never getting a single Splinter.
---
"You coul only drop a survivor 3 times"  
---
Do you actually do ANY research before you reply to me? Try taking a look at [this video](https://youtu.be/PR1qg715QoU?t=55) where the survivor was dropped and picked up 5 TIMES! The drop animation was prioritized over the DS animation, and the wiggle bar doesn't exist until DS is out of play. This wasn't altered until DS was reworked to be an anti-tunnel perk.   
---
"Don't know why you think thats invalid"  
---
How hard is it for you to understand that WGLF doesn't do ANYTHING to improve your chances at winning the game? This honestly baffles me as to how you don't understand that. 'Asymmetric game' doesn't mean "Since the killer is more powerful, it's balanced". Survivor perks are supposed to assist you in WINNING the game, not giving you points and doing absolutely nothing else for you. A 4 second aura reading ability on players who are much SLOWER than the killer, that activates ONLY during unhooks, isn't going to completely cripple a killer's game.   
---
"Tell that to the people that like to use botany for the extra 33%."  
---
Tell that to the people who use "We'll Make It" and get 100% extra healing speed on others for 90 seconds for unhooking someone. You're trying to recreate weak, useless perks that already exist in the game instead of giving WGLF an actual *useful* function.
---
They all pretty much stomp it with a couple that slap it. Spirit has the most unique one, I wish they gave the same treatment to everyone else as hers has more character.
---
Definitely normal.
---
They weren't swinging or anything? If they were you could have farmed the altruism.
---
Don’t you mean how a bad killer plays coldwind?
---
I do it with all games.
---
Nah. You can report him but nothing would probably come of it.
---
I literally watched a video that he uploaded last week of him playing killers like Leatherface and Doctor in red ranks. Please don't perpetuate the idea that it's impossible to play other killers at red rank than Hillbilly or Nurse. This game has gotten much closer to balanced lately and if you can't see that, you're probably a biased salty killer main
---
&gt;In the time is takes for a survivor to be fully sacrificed in one hooking, you can get 3 full generators done.
---
If you're able to quickly locate gens and bypass perks like ruin, then maybe. But you'll be met with noed for gen rushing, when we all know the killer does NOT deserve 2 kills. 
---
&gt;A killer wont get a respectable amount of BP for this scenario either, as they aren't getting points for chases, gen protection, etc.
---
The survivors won't get a respectable amount of bp either. They'll get more than the killer if they manage to escape, but they won't have many points in the boldness and alturism category, which happen due to the killer's actions (except for cleansing totems, and sitting in the basement for boldness, but thats wasted gen time). The killer will be getting more bp then those they can sacrifice. In a sense, camping punishes the survivors bloodpoint wise too.
---
&gt;In the end it doesn't matter what the Devs do, bad behaviour will still exist, you can't ban people for camping, and trying to get rid of it via gameplay/reward changes will just hurt normal play. 
---
They've implemented an anti camp mechanic in a ptb a while ago I believe, but it was abused. They can easily implement something like an anti camp mechanic again. Hook progression slows if the killer is within x meters of the hook for 20 seconds, hook progression stops if the killer is in x meters for 30 seconds uninterrupted. However, this does not occur if: there are other survivors within x meters of the hooked survivor, or the exit gates are powered. Buff insidious, buff leatherface, and that solves the camping problem by specifically punishing those who camp while not hurting those who don't camp/patrol the hook looking for other survivors they think are near.
---
&gt;Put them on the hook, limit their ability to get bloodpoints for themselves, punish them
---
That's kinda the issue though? Yeah you wanna punish toxicity, but isn't there a better way to go about it? Camping allows for a killer to do all these things to someone even if they're innocent, it'll be a cycle of toxicity. Survivor gets camped, survivor becomes more toxic, killer gets bullied, killer becomes toxic and camps, repeat. It just isn't a good cycle.
---
I consider it tunneling when you are already in a chase with someone but leave when someone gets unhooked to go after that person
---
I think she's easily better then huntress and clown. Not healing vs any killer is just dumb, M1 or not.
---
Wait since when you can close it as killer.. so no more hatch stand off?
---
Monitor &amp; Abuse is very helpful on Legion.
---
I do that and I'll insult the killer in a weird way. Like I went against a LF with Franklin's and I yelled they're not allowed to come to my birthday party.
---
&gt;.&gt; ...dinkleburg!
---
Sounds a bit rude to me... also, when would one use a god pallet?
---
The thing I don't get about this meme is you're going to get hit through that pallet anyway.
---
Thx :)
---
LUL much better, but Id say even better would be "IM HAVING FUN, WHY SHOULD I GIVE A FUCK BOUT YOU?" Because man old legion was fun to play, despite the obvious hatred from the survivor side
---

Does anyone know if this is going to be changed because I've tried doing it recently and just found out about this change XD 
---
I wish I started the game before this change but I just started the game like 3 days ago.
---
Like when you wake up at 3am and drink some cold ass water
---
nope. the new update introduced the end game collapse. when the hatch is closed or the gates are open, survivors gotta gtfo or die. heres the video about it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqGzYaiiMlY
---
Well, there's a reason people say she's the third best killer, after Nurse and Billy. If you are any good at mind games you win every chase. The only issue is the blasting chase music drowning out every other aspect of the audio
---
Thank you!
---
I think it's this weird thing called a joke.
---
People's definitions will vary on what constitutes tunneling, but basically if you only chase one person all game, or specifically try to run one person into the ground to eliminate them, that is tunneling. Sometimes it's justified, sometimes it's not, and usually it's not a strong strategy.
---
A good example would be this: hitting the unhooked person because their teammate unhooked them in front of you is logical, because they're injured and now on another hook stage. Tunneling, technically, but the logical play. Hearing an unhook while you're engaged with another player and leaving chase with that player to go chase the unhooked person again is definitely the bad and non-optimal type of tunneling. Or if the Killer just refuses to smack anyone else and will ignore/walk around other players to get to their tunnel target. 100% chance of them doing this if they run Dying Light.
---
Just having a long chase with someone isn't tunneling, per se, but if you refuse to give up a chase on someone you can't catch that kind of qualifies too, in the sense that tunneling is short for tunnel vision so you're overly committed to one target.
---
This works if the basement is in the Thompson's house too I believe
---
This is just 90% of survivors
---
That's usually what I have trouble with -- I get tunnel vision (pun partially intended) and focus on the chase, not realizing the player is trying to pull me away from the gens.
---
i’d rather face a legion than a doctor, especially since the update
---
It's the only one that didn't look aids lmao
---
DC
---
Yeah, basically
---
I'm more focused on the crow appearing despite the fact youre moving
---
I was thinking more like this guy, a pip a day.
---
My pick would be Micheal because he is almost involnerable(or how you write it). Just watch film theory about him.
---
I know what people really need /s
---
She is great, but if you are a beginner, it’s very hard to play with her.
---
why do you dc from haddonfield?
---
Wraith maybe sinse he could be invinsible and pop out of nowere
---
I feel that. I try to go in imagining that I'm a cold, calculating Killer with no emotions, which is an ironically healthy mindset while playing this game. It all comes down to mind games, so if you can be in more control of yourself than the Survivors, you're already ahead of them. Which sounds a lot easier than it is in the moment.
---
True, but I’m talking game logic.
---
The number of times a killer carries me to hatch and gives me it is low.
---
The number of times a killer will bring me near hatch, drop me, close it and shake their head and then hook me is high.
---
The number of times a killer takes my lack of wiggling as an opportunity to spin around in circles and basement hook me while BMing is even higher. Why wouldn't I wiggle and just get it over with? For the one in maybe 40 times I am actually given hatch, it isn't worth the other 39. I just want to get on to my next one.
---
Nurse goes WWE on the hatch goddamn
---
I had 3K first time playing her so...
---
If Freddy was smart he would sleep one or two of the strongest.
---
This would slow down their action speed, helping the other killers to take them out. 
---
Freddy then sleeps the new strongest killers and repeats the process until only one is left. 
---
Freddy now has a one on one fight with weaker killer who is worn out from going through a death match with all the other killers. Freddy has been relaxing in the corner so he should win no problem.
---
All Freddy has to worry about is avoiding the killers that he sleeps which should be easy as they will be busy with the rest of the killers.
---
But we don’t know if *any* of the killers can be killed by game logic, it’s not something the game ever tells us
---
Why are you running DH and BL in the same build?
---
Answer: Hex ruin is NOT op
---
Why: Hex ruin can not only he disabled, but can also be bypassed by hitting great skill checks. If the survivors know how to land great skill checks consistently, it only serves to stop extra progression from those skill checks.
---
The Hag just slaps it.
---
"Bad hatch! Close."
---
- OK grandma... ;-;
---
I'd call tunneling a behavior when killer focuses on a specific survivor until they are sacrificed. Basically a tunnel vision
---
I'll be the 12 year old in this situation *inhales* 
---
r/woooosh
---
Hmm, I couldn't say for sure, we'd need a side by side comparison of the action to be certain.
---
a wallpaper of that, will be awesome
---
\&gt;be you  
---
\&gt;create a meme, intended to be shared among hundreds, possibly thousands of people with the idea that they might relate to it and/or laugh at it  
---
\&gt;worry about people stealing said meme  
---
???
---
Huntress would win hands down. She seems to have the strongest weapon and to be the strongest killer overall ( she's the only killer who can throw axes at a infinite range, you need some muscle for that ).

We can close the hatch now??? Fuckin A! When did they add this in???
---
Ruin, Surveillance, Enduring, Spirit Fury with John's Medical File and Video Tape as add-ons.
---
Mb, later.
---
Yesterday I tunnelled the shit out of a david who teabagged after he dropped a pallet on me. No regrets. 
---
He later sent me a few angry DM's stating that I'm toxic and that there's nothing wrong with tea bagging.
---
No, I don’t believe so. Close inspection reveals that the title is still the same. Therefore, one could only assume that you are using sarcasm as a way to protest the sudden influx of dank memes that are flooding this particular subreddit.
---
MoM is getting nerfed. And you can easily activate MoM against Billy if you know how to loop.
---
I dont talk aloud really but I do in my head like I usually say what I’m doing so pull the pallet, vault the window, and I’m dead or on killer I’ll talk about if the lunge is gonna hit
---
For my Piggy build I equip 1.fat 2.spectacles 3.asthma (its a Lord of the Flies reference)

Rework the pink addons and items to be strong, but only usable if you haven't dc'ed in your last 20 games.
---
Why not
---
I can’t find any holes in your logic.
---
That is also true, unfortunately.
---
The freddy rework should add water fountains so you can do this
---
Just make it 4 stacks or how WGLF works when you do safe unhooks you get a token, ect but if it’s just straight protections hits to get it working it will be a dead worthless perk like Ash’s other two perks and I want my money back then
---
Playing bubba is like swimming through maple syrup inside an inflatable ball. Playing against him you wonder if everyone else has hacked his files. He never hits trees walls or any objects, always has extra speed and never is using any of those add ons.
---
XD I went against this Clown who would facecamp nonstop, and because I usually run Borrowed Time, he didn't like me and started focusing on me. When I hit him with a pallet, he just stood there for a minute afterward instead of moving around it or trying to break it so out loud, to myself, I said, "Everybody saw that! Everybody's laughing at you!" Didn't teabag or gesture or anything, just stood there in-game.
---
So if you were against a Myers doctor, legion, wraith, you will nevee bother to heal vs them too?
---
You can't always relay on getting to a loop in the first place, especially when they might have enduring, bamboozle, and so on.
---
When they do cleanse she does have map control. No matter how good you are not healing is just stupid. It's why insta downs are so powerful in the first place.
---
I’ve seen people with 3000 hours....crazy
---
Exactly and dbd isnt supposed to he a horror movie if it was freddy would be able to go stretch armstrong on the survivors and pig would actually take them to a trap room and leather face would put them on meat hooks... I mean would eat them
---
Yeah I had a friends dad have like 3600 hours in a different game and when csgo was a big game pros would have 8000 but the most I have in any game is 1000 and in dbd I have 600 cause I take breaks from games when new ones come out then come back to the ones I like
---
The spirits is super nice
---
But they put in perks like insidious which encourage  people to camp. The devs r stupid
---
The map suffers from rng really hard, sometimes there are walls and hedges that stretch for miles, there are fence loops that require bloodlust 3 to get a hit on ( [example](https://youtu.be/bQZ1m1KaM50?t=277) ).
---
The building on that map are awful for a lot of killers, if you are on one side of a house that can't be entered and huntress is on the other side of it, you can run her around for a good minute before she even gets in your line of sight.
---
Myers' house on that map is the last remaining infinite in the game if the survivor has balanced landing, you drop chase when you vault from the downstairs window, so you can literally keep that loop going forever if the survivor is good.
---
Nurse can't blink through a lot of stuff on that map. It's filled with dead zones she can't breach.
---
Alright I see to my understanding survivors ten to be near the furthest gens so I think what I will try and do is herd survivors closer to the 3 gens and and ceck back in between to see if any are being worked on and if they are il search find someone and try and down them. 
---
Survailence should give me a hand, thanks for the insight dude.👍🏼
---
No slugging isn’t bannable
---
the clowns belly when he is closing the hatch lmao
---
Yeah I’ve had a situation where I was hooked and I’m fine if you dont get me if the killer will kill you but he sat on a gen and did it when the hag set one trap under me and was chasing someone else
---
I’m surprised clown didn’t fall over and start wheezing
---
That sounds actually fun for altruistic guys like me
---
That’s true but I feel like if he could get close enough by dodging she’d be fucked
---
n00b question, I'm just a casual player. Is this a new feature or have the killers always been able to close the hatch?
---
Idk why but the way michael turns and looks at Feng kills me
---
I think Mettle of Man woulda been fine if you just raised the hits needed to activate to four (at least you would need to be healed first and all that), but changing it to protective hits sounds interesting.
---
I wasn’t blaming the killer for my teammates stupidity.
---
what did the deleted comment say. **I want to know now**
---
I ironically slapped my knee to this, but I slapped it too hard and now it hurts :(
---
It’s in flares
---
they taste like souls
---
he's taunting you... is that bad???
---
new feature. added with the end game collapse
---
If you buy a dlc for perks i have to say you wasted a lot of money anyways.
---
Can we get Chuck E  from Chuck E Cheeses or little caeser?
---
It's stupid, and that's why everyone memes it so hard.
---
It's the perfect comedic juxtaposition, a horror game featuring Micheal Myers, the incarnation of evil itself chasing his victims while purposely shirtless.
---
It is
---
Do the michael theme
---
Kinda wish there was more diversity in it. It would be nice if legion crouched down and stabbed it to close it or if huntress raised her axe and crashed it down to close it.
---
You see, your issue is that you automatically assume that when a group of survivors wants to cleanse all the totems, they instantly teleport to and start cleansing, and even then it’d be 28 seconds instead of 14. Then you don’t even think about the searching time for all the totems, which even if you know the spawns, it’ll still take at least 2-3 minutes if you’re doing it yourself. In 3 minutes, assuming you’re uninterrupted, you can do 2 gens by yourself. You also never consider the fact that if you’re alone or maybe with one other person, you’re entirely unable to know whether or not your team cleansed any totems unless you see them do it or you find broken bits or totem somewhere, but even then you have to spend that time searching because you can never be sure. Keep in mind that all this bullshit and time wasting is because the killer fucking *POTENTIALLY* has noed. The fact that this perk can do all of this even if it’s *not even in the fucking match* is absolutely insane. You can count perks all you want but if you miss one or if one isn’t revealed by the end, it doesn’t matter.
---
Its shitty memes tho
---
I miss the good ols original memes instead of a text over a picture
---
They are all skins at the end of the day, their perks is what makes them and BhVR is taking the only good perk that came with Ash and nerfing it. Do you see people using Flip Flop or Buckle Up? No you don’t because they are straight trash perks especially on PS4.
---
implying a good Nurse has problems with MoM. oh no the 5 second chase became a 7 second chase.
---
I have been called. Any Pig related stuff you should ask me. Fun Pig builds: Anything that increases the amount of times you get stunned, so I say ruin,Monitor and Abuse, Brutal and Enduring.
---
Wait, wait, wait.
---
You really need a double pip for the adept achievements and a 4k? I'm confsued. I'm pretty sure that wasn't the case when i got my adept legion (maybe a week after he got out). \*thinking\* But it would explain why i can't get this damn achievement with plague.
---
I do think that most survivors usually initiate the toxicity. However, I've had a *lot* of games where I tbag at pallets simply because I'm being obviously tunnelled or because the killer nodded at me last time I was downed and then the killer declares in the end game chat that they tunnelled me because I BMd first, which is an obvious lie.
---
My feelings man
---
I get that there are many reasons for dcs. This is not meant as a solution to all of them. I think bans and such are a more widespread solution. 
---
I do however get plenty of DCs to deny me points. Often on the last hook and then I get hatemail staying this is the reason. 
---
This suggestion is more about making the effects of dcs less impactful regarding points, and to reduce one motivation of dcs.
---
Definitely not a fix for all of them. The benefit to survivors is more the reduced disconnects with a little bit of points as a better then nothing bonus.
---
I'm gonna level with you, I just realllllyyyyy like shocking people. I have way more fun playing the doctor when I get to just shock the shit out of people and make them hallucinate. To the point where if i get a kill or two and four hooks I'll usually just spend the rest of the game electrocuting the last two survivors because it's funny to me.
---
BZZZZTTT \*scream\* HeEhEeHeEhEeHeEhEe
---
Except rounding exists
---
Doo tired of all this shitty "memes"
---
it's the meta build, monto just took it and renamed it
---
Yes but what I'm saying is the dcing survivor obviously doesn't care about rank or bp or they wouldn't dc so how would this discourage them. Also curious at what rank you get these dc's and hate
---
its wanker not blanka
---
Not op easily countered by a great skill check or finding totem
---
Instead of trying to close dead by daylight on task manager try finding the easyanticheat and force close that.
---
It's not a nerf, it's a bug. It doesn't appear too often. When I see someone like Tru3 playing Spirit, that glass breaking sound appear just 2 times per match. And he phasing a lot with her. Plus, the glass breaking sound has a small range, survivors need to be pretty close to you if they want to hear it. Most of the time, that bug is too inconsistent to affect you in any way.
---
New Susie outfit?
---
A random person  - who is not the DS user, I think - becomes obsession. DS can become the obsession if there are 2 DS users though.
---
can you do one from killer perspective too?
---
Yeah! She might drown tho
---
That would be awesome I didn’t even think about these characters lol
---
I never bothered findng the hatches but now I know where they are, thanks. Seriously
---
This. For all we know, that 99% could be 98,8%, and that 1% could be 0,85%.
---
Hatches spawn randomly
---
My boi Demi would like a word with you
---
The devs haven't said anything about it and it's been months and it's still going on and when I would main spirit it would always happen
---
Try this from an elevated command prompt:
---
    wmic process where name="DeadByDaylight.exe" call terminate
---
&gt;New feature: survivors can drink fountains when facing Freddy to wake up early
---
&gt;New feature: survivors with full bladders need to visit an outhouse before working on a generator
---
Because if they DC you still didn't technically earn the hook
---
:^) always spell check your memes
---
Searched in the process tab and in the detail tab of the task manager but there's no EAC process anywhere
---
Nice username though
---
Wraith literally could not care less about the hatch
---
That's what will happen when moderators don't filter out the low quality stuff. I really wish they'd prohibit lazy memes, such as macros.  
---
Sometimes I wonder if they even enforce rule #2. I report any post that breaks it, but I don't get the feeling that they do a whole lot about said posts.  
---
And to anyone reading this who likes lazy memes, sure, I might just be a grumpy brown nose, but is it so wrong to not encourage mediocrity?
---
If don't wiggle as the last survivor I'm almost always still hooked.
---
sucks to your ass-mar!
---
Sabo sucks now tho. Might as well just bring a tool box and run a useful perk lol
---
I mean...it most certainly killed her.
---
Oh leatherface.
---
My thoughts exactly. Nurse uses her power, Spirit her sword, Hag atleast slaps it.  
---
I know it is probably not easy to do but why can't Clown use his gas bottle, the Plague her shit, Doctor his electricity.  Trapper could make a huge ass trap on it. Stuff like that would be a lot cooler.
---
I’ll casually scold other players for silly mess ups when playing Killer. And when I’m getting my ankles broken it usually switches between 
---
“goddamn this Meg/Nea/Feng, COME BACK HERE SO I CAN SMACK/STAB YOU A LITTLE”
---
To 
---
“No Meg, that pallet is not going to save you because HITBOOOX. No Kate, you can’t make that window.”
---
To
---
“Wait what....where did they go? ....uhhh hello?”
---
And usually as survivor it’s just “FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK. NO DONT DO IT, GO AWAY LEAVE ME ALONE FUCK.”
---
holy shit gameplay is so choppy i can't watch it without getting a headache
---
It’s useless space on my bloodwebs. I love trying to avoid offerings to let me play as Freddy when I could just....play Freddy.
---
Seriously ? I heard "blanka" when I watched Samination animations, Jesus 😂.
---
Doubt.
---
It was the ACTIVE build for the Killer team, and they have a MONTH until he comes out. He ain't changing a great deal.
---
They don't drink, they wash.
---
* “So long as nobody in your head is answering back, it should be fine.”*
---
they dont appear buddy. just stop it
---
Of course there are :) I was survivor main before, started playing killer to improve my survival knowledge. Ended up playing killer better than surviving. Still I play killer for points and for sport, not for kills, so DC means I'm playing seriously until everybody were hooked twice, and farm after that
---
it makes me think they're angrily closing one of those trash cans with the foot lid thing
---
actually look at legion, they kick it under an angle with heel as they need to put more force into one spot (physics shit, area of pressure is less so it hits harder) which proves legion can be presumed as weak killer
---
You’re totally right, I’m just being dramatic, I guess I’m just blind or something.
---
Pepehands
---
Ah! That makes sense and is very nice. Definitely beats the toxic people who troll the end game chat
---
Sorry if it's a stupid question, but what does 'being immersive' mean?
---
I love how I lose out on a barbecue stack just because these idiots can't let themselves get hooked once.
---
Yeah totally!
---
if they drop you near hatch to close and bm you have nearly guaranteed chance of wiggling off when they pick you up again...
---
I play both sides equally and both have super toxic parts to them, it’s not one or the either, it’s both. The toxic people will be toxic to the other side and it’s a constant cycle of toxicity. It’s what happens when you carve 2 distinct roles in a game. 
---
Point is, revenge toxicity doesn’t solve anything, it just makes a cycle of toxicity.
---
Yeah I always advice people to trap that way. Trapper's worst enemy is his predictability
---
If we go by lore, Freddy or Myers.
---
Gameplay wise it would be hard to say, I think it more depends on how they use their powers, and if all legion members can be their at once too.
---
Though I think Myers would win once her gets tier 3
---
You get the perks even if you don't own the dlc so you just bought the skins.
---
I mean can you blame them? Gens get done at ridiculous speeds, MoM is broken as shit, and looping is irritating and very time consuming. Nurse deals with all of that. It’s not like those people *want* to play nurse, they have to.
---
Reeee
---
Squatting and doing nothing, usually accompanied by hearing the heartbeat for a brief second.
---
That was dope
---
Ah, that makes sense.
---
did the corn just not spawn?
---
Games being brought back and being completely redesigned. It’s coming out later this year and I’m hyped, but yeah the game is dead as shit.
---
idk i just pulled the images off google.
---
\*Pops Bundled Jizo Statue
---
I try to do this all the time. Some survivors don't quite get the hint while others do. To be fair most cases  people realize I am dragging there ass to the hatch. Others think I was "being toxic" and holding the game hostage. Pre-disabling messages I had quite a few people lose there shit at me thinking I was mocking them by ignoring every hook and stopping completely on a hatch. Then backing away from the hatch. Then doing less than nothing to stop them. 
---
It boggles the mind.
---
Farm is good for billy ?
---
Yes but not for every other killer. Note, i didnt play as the Billy during these games.
---
Spirit's one seems so cool, she just stabs the hatch down and doesn't even get the sword because it just disappears back into her hand. Also nice how the Nurse just SLAMS that thing down. Pretty nice animations.
---
Pukey shows more leg? 
---
*SIGN ME UP TO DIE.*
---
Getting no bloodpoints at all *and* screwing your team over!
---
Hey, I appreciate the response. Long or short, it's always cool to have chill conversation.
---
Let me preface: I'm a player who believes that the only "wrong" way to play is to do something the system doesn't normally permit, like Legion moonwalking and the Trapper/Agitation bug. I don't think that it's the place of the developers to ban or otherwise prevent people from displaying poor sportsmanship. The developers are making a game experience, not moderating the emotional responses of competitors. 
---
That said, I used the word "sportsmanship" on purpose. While we may throw the word "meta" around for our builds and our playstyles, I feel there's a separate meta among some players who feel that generating emotional responses is a part of gameplay. Whipping up survivors or killers, dropping an "EZ" on someone after  giving them flashlight cancer, even responses in this sub meant to make people angry or salty. These are things that some players prioritize over objectives or survival, and it's reasonable to want something done about that. Folks are wrong to involve the devs, though. The question becomes, is this something our community supports or tolerates?
---
The answer appears to be "Yes", for all intents and purposes. Tolerates, at least. So we're inevitably going to see discussion around it. And in those discussions, answers like "I only have fun when others don't have fun." are inevitable. Folks are playing the meta of making each other angry. I ain't gotta love that particular minigame, but I work hard to not play it.
---
Lol yeah I do at times.  My go to lines are as follows.
---
"What were you thinking dude?"
---
"OH COME ON!"
---
"Bro in what universe did you think that would work on me?"
---
"Get the fuck outta here, how is that a hit?"
---
"I disagree"
---
this is cannot be real
---
I love it
---
*miss waaaaaaah*
---
Doctor isn't even a good killer though.  Super easy to beat typically. 
---
He's just a problem for rank 18's that can't repair gens and hit skill checks without it being a doctor.
---
Feed Myers more free evil baby survivor, thanks for the free BP + Salt.
---
Impact font memes yay
---
yeah as i said in another comment, he’s a balanced killer. but i really don’t enjoy playing against him at all.
---
Some people have over 6k hours lol
---
That was the first surv's fault for going for the basement save alone. You needed to bring more people for the initial save, at least 2, with the right perks (BT, DS, DH, etc..). Basement saves against a camper with insta-down are not supposed to be easy. I have no idea when the first guy thought he was going to accomplish by going down there by himself.
---
I think it’s actually because the licensing issues f13 is having. Original writer wants rights or something along those lines and it needs to be settled in a lengthy court battle.
---
What a wholesome post
---
when it's a Nurse you don't disconnect at least until she down you once.
---
If you dc because of maps you're too big of a pussy to play killer.  Switch to survivor if you're going to play like a little bitch.
---
How so? I got my down/grab, and if I want to carry them to a hook I have well earned to do it.
---
(rank 1 killer and survivor 750+ hours) the biggest tips I can give to survivor is honestly just play flexible. Everytime I see survivors try to stick to one role ( only gens, only going for saves, only trying to get chased) but it severely hinders progress. And always know how much distance you have between you and the killer looping is mostly just knowing what's safe and what's not which comes from experience. Now for killer. It is ok to switch targets 👏👏if your chasing a survivor and already got a hit on them and you see someone on a gen switch targets it greatly increases your map pressure when you've got multiple people stopped and injured and then can continue on hurt people. As killer or survivor you also have to know when to mind game and when to not. Don't do either 100% of the time. ( A good example is don't always try to double back a pallet. Or as survivor if I'm running head on and I've stunned the killer sometimes I'll stop getting in lockers cause they will check them even if I'm not in it because they think I'm trying to use my perk.) And for my final general tip. Use perks with your playstyle don't use things just because they are meta. Use perks that you'll be in situations to use. Or alternatively adjust in the situation to USE your perks. Hopefully this was a little helpful. Glhf in the fog!
---
I escape roughly half the time in EGC. Working as intended.
---
You say that as if BBQ doesn't exist
---
? what do you mean, the title is What Happened to this sub? then i ask in the post did it recently change from deadbydaylight to deadbydaylightmemesonly? sure i could have made a much longer drawn out post about why the memes are overrunning this channel but i wanted to get to the point and find out if i am only one of a few that actually wanna see less Memes and more discussion about the game itself.
---
Its really different than DbD. Your knowledge here is definelty going to help but many things wont work or apply there
---
Best advice I can give on both sides- **learn what a safe, semi-safe, and unsafe pallet is**
---
Ohtofu made a great video on YouTube about pallet safety [here](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=VPr_bQdVkj0) that really changed my view of the game. I could easily categorize pallet loops as good or bad (depending on my role) and I played a lot better afterwards.
---
Just buy it so u can't get it after u get tier 3 of it makes getting other perks easier cause ur taking the other perks out of the pool
---
Ormond fuckin' sucks for both sides. i can't even see where i hooked the survivors or where my teammates were hooked
---
She is my #2 I feel like Spirit is #1
---
It’s ok we all end up back by the campfire 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
They just slam the exit gate lever with their weapon
---
i don’t mind ormond on survivor because of how strong the main building is ESPECIALLY with balanced landing
---
the loops are pretty bad too
---
i just feel like dcing when i get it as killer; it’s a massive map and i’m just not used to the different tiles
---
BBQ and Chili  gives points to the killet for literally just doing their objective, and unless somebody DCs they are almost guaranteed to get their 4 tokens, and it has another use to it other than just bloodpoints. WGLF is just a dead perk that relies on having teammates to farm
---
It's a shame they all have basically a basic stomp animation, a little more variety would've been nice but I can see how that would run out of ideas very quickly
---
Exactly. Altruism is the only thing with good payout, which encourages everyone to swarm the hook and fight over who gets the rescue since there is a finite number of unhooks that can be made per trial. If there was any alternative way to earn decent BPs, killers wouldn't have to complain about hook-divers and farmers because people wouldn't be desperate for WGLF stacks.
---
ironically i’ve stopped maining claudette since I made my account.  Jane came out and...
---
[Well this.](https://youtu.be/iBErCltsLrM)
---
Are perks in Identity V restricted to specific characters or you can learn them and equip on anybody like in DbD?
---
Unfortunately we all probably do.
---
Thought the thirst was referring to the puke
---
You did nothing wrong. This is what I wish other survivors would do when I’m being camped. Instead you get people who just run in and farm you with no BT, accomplishing nothing except speeding up your death, or people who crouch around waiting for the killer to leave for several minutes while no gens get done. Doing the gens and punishing the killer for camping is the best you can hope for.
---
Almost a month ago. It's called the end game collapse, you should look it up, because closing he hatch is not the only thing that changed.
---
Killers can no longer hatch grab survivors, hatch always spawns when only 1 survivor alive, no matter how many generators got done. Closing the hatch will block the generators and power the exit gates, it will also start the end game collapse. Opening an exit gate will also trigger the end game collapse. When the end game collapse activates, you have 2 minutes to gtfo or die. You do get extra time when a survivor is dying or hooked
---
The first time I closed the hatch as spirit I audibly said "oh shit!". Yet another reason shes my favorite killer to play.
---
Idk man spirit is pretty good with the right add ons
---
It's "tunneling" whenever the need an excuse as to why they keep fucking up and getting caught.
---
Looping isn't toxic, it's just boring, and when you are looped for 2-3 minutes I'll probably camp as all the gens will be fixed by then.
---
Context: Played a Doctor match kept finding this one Feng who was my Obsession. Would zap her into Tier 3 and then leave her alone because I had Save the Best for Last.
---
There were two Survivors left (other two suicided instantly :/) - the Obsession and the one with No Mither. No Mither Survivor was actually playing really Stealthy (I only ever got them into Tier 1) and I kept finding the Obsession thanks to Doctor clones. Eventually downed the Obs and hooked them to which they suicided on the hook and No Mither Survivor got the hatch.
---
Obsession then calls me "sweaty" because I *chased her too much.* Again I would literally just zap her into Tier 3 and then leave her alone.
---
No Mither told Obession to stop being a crybaby because I did well and the rest of the team was trash. Really cool high ranked Nea telling Entitled Survivors what's up.
---
“I used to be so useful..”
---
Dance, Bubba. Dance like there’s no one watching.
---
Can someone explain the game mechanics with the bar at the top? I haven't played in a long time, so I'm not up to date with all this new fingfangled stuff
---
what is this picture from?
---
Oh
---
Yeah this is definitely not a reused animation for her.
---
Depends. The persona tree has unlockable stuff with a level system that applies to everyone. Once you get max level on it you got it forever. Now each character works in different ways and has different bonuses as well as unique items they can’t drop
---
Fun perks &gt; meta perks
---
In the end, it’s a game. Having fun is better than just gettin’ the job done. Two perks for fun, two perks for success is how I usually roll. I’d drop self-care in most instances because you can bring/find a medkit easily enough or get a teammate to heal you. But I digress- this is about what you *could* have done.
---
I think you did the only smart thing, honestly. Everyone would have died due to over-altruism. The other survivors just got mad that they didn’t play the best. Not much can be done about a camping killer- that’s why it’s talked down on so much. Ignore those that do nothing but blame others.
---
Curious about the animations, glad for the spinning Leatherface. You made my day, sir
---
May as well have a drink while you're there though right?
---
Really smooth? There's three unique ones and then everyone else shares the same one. I just watched a video of everyone stomping the ground and making a hatch flip over on itself that looks physically impossible.
---
No one can resist Michael's gaze...*no one*.
---
Pretty sure the hatch close animations are closely related to the pallet break animations. With this I mean that the killers use the same method of closing the hatch as they do when breaking pallets.
---
This is how it is as an experienced survivor going against a new killer, you square tf up because you're confident but you're also insanely afraid.
---

Man it's been two months since this image was reposted. That has to be a new record or something.
---
Some sweet other survivors sweat and blood, right? haha
---
People are save hungry in general anymore only way to pip is to do a little of everything
---
&gt;Your suggestion would make for a good perk in itself.
---
No. Survs get jack shit for BP anyways, the least they could do is make WGLF at least as easy to stack as BBQ.
---
https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/657/039/7fa.jpg
---
Please step on my head, Huntress
---
In the last dev stream they mentioned reworking the system to reward different play styles e.g. Gen jockey. Hopefully this means higher BP payouts as well.
---
Taunt to get bodied
---
Well not from the pool bit but from the fountain tap bit.
---
Imagine using the "imagine" insult setup unironically.
---
my bad for not catching it, but if the lore wasn't very apparent about it the first few times reading it, and most people also agree, then i think that says something.
---
Most people don't agree, hence the downvotes. Just because you don't catch something doesn't make it poorly written.
---
&gt;Really smooth? There's three unique ones and then everyone else shares the same one.
---
Well, the problem here is variety. It doesn't change the fact that the existing animations are smooth. 
---
&gt;I just watched a video of everyone stomping the ground and making a hatch flip over on itself that looks physically impossible.
---
It doesn't make any sense to use real logic in DBD to complain about targeted issues you dislike. 
---
Unless you believe it is "physically possible" to run faster than a car holding a chainsaw revved in front of you.
---
"Physically possible" to have a giant meat hook through your chest and not die immediately.
---
I wish I had a post game chat since everyone DC's before the game is over.
---
Oh look, more post-game salt. I sure love this kind of post.
---
My usual build is STBFL/Ruin, Brutal/Spirit Fury, Enduring and BBQ. I think Distressing is pretty dogshit unless you run it with Unnerving, and unless you play to 3-gen (so unless you're a subhuman) I wouldn't run it. 
---
Also dont run Thana like that other guy is telling. Just dont. It's worthless. 
---
T. 1k hour Doc main.
---
Did you ever see a meme that isn’t exaclty that ?
---
That’ll be interesting on bass, or should I do it on my electric guitar?
---
Yeah that's the point
---
Yeah the dab was unnecessary too. Like the killer wasn't going after him and already had someone. Plus he escaped right after opening the gate instead of making sure his team was good to get out too.
---
Was about to say this. Prob just some tournament’s rules
---
I wish patches wouldn't keep breaking stuff... it's so fucking saddening...
---
You mean 351 more to go, right ?
---
I would say pleased.
---
I got 3 ebony mories and 3 bps on hg while leveling her up for ruin.  I don’t play hag.  I’ve never gotten a bps on any other character (killer or survivor) and not a single other ebony mori.  RNG is real lmao

The god claudette cant kite the killer around bc she already DC'ed

I got 3 ebony mories and 3 bps on hag while leveling her up for ruin.  I don’t play hag.  I’ve never gotten a bps on any other character (killer or survivor) and not a single other ebony mori.  RNG is real lmao
---
On PS4, I find 6-10 rank range being the most entertaining and diverse in terms of killers, but quite frustrating and disappointing when it comes to your teammates. 
---
So, best option is to try and never rely on others.
---
Shoulda brought self care
---
No
---
Reading these comments...
---
Mettle of Man is useless against a good nurse. That chase is only going to make it be 10 seconds longer. And you can’t heal or your aura will be revealed to the nurse, increasing how fucked you are already.
---
Gen snatcher spirit is good, but in my experience, you get used to prayer beads fast into the game, especially since everyone will want gems done and cleanse the Ruin. 
---
Billy is top tier and a counter to Mettle of Man, and sure, he can break pallets. But y’all forget, who’s able to phase through ~~pallets~~ absolutely pretty much fucking anything?
---
And before you say anything about any killer being better than nurse, including infinite mend legion, I hope you face a five blink nurse. Not saying a mori because you’re dying in first hook. Might add to this if more people in the comments mention different killer setups.
---
It'd be nice if they buffed pharmacy, make it have a % chance to give purple medkits or bonus add ons.
---
I’ve posted a video on my insta where the hatch literally spawned in the corner of the map on the swamp lol
---
You know what’s really unfair!!??!? Losing my offering when the game doesn’t LOAD!
---
Hahaha the plague just taps it with her toe
---
SAME I was all for vommy mommy till I read the comments 😭😭😭
---
Myers with the awkward ending like “did you get that?”
---
No I mean the fact that it's really stressful not bad
---
I got the ‘where did they go’ achievement with a group of randoms. The hatch was near the exit gate we opened and one of the survivors had a key so we all jumped in.
---
I love Haddonfield. It’s a shame so many cowards DC the second we load into it.
---
Ballerina Bubba
---
Plague closes it with her toes! So elegant :D
---
Dont play him without perk that slows gens like ruin or corrupt intervention, you need time to set up.
---
Dont trap on pallets but rather on loops in grass if possible.
---
Trapper is really add-on dependant any bag is almost always a good choice.
---
Enduring and Spirit furry helps to down people since you cant trap everything and without traps you are M1 killer.
---
Survivors must piss accurately into toilets to deplete their bladder meter, however, missing a skill check makes you piss all over the floor and toilet seat alerting the killer to your position and slowing down piss progress for other survivors
---
Oh I see. I’ve never tried to use my body for collision WHILE they juke me, it has always been a lucky moment to get collision. I usually just stop phasing and turn my view really quick to find him again. Thanks for rancor but I don’t think I’m gonna use it, I’m tryna build my devour build with haunted grounds, bbq and Enduring but I’m willing to swap it a bit everytime
---
The fact that you're 1 emblem away from the next pip thing makes it hurt even more
---
The sheriff guy (I forgot his name it has been a while) would make a good survivor though, but what would the Demogorgon do as a killer? Still funny picturing it putting people on hooks.
---
&gt; Dont trap on pallets but rather on loops in grass if possible.
---
This depends on the rank tbh.
---
At lower ranks, 20 to 10, survivors don't know how to loop so trapping pallets CORRECTLY is the best strat.
---
So am I
---
It's because he doesn't part his arms, he's still holding the chainsaw with both arms so the body movement looks restricted.
---
Gotta leave them on the ground and find the other one
---
so you admit to being rank 20 and yet you make a montage of you running shack for less then a min?
---
I didn’t get that far into thinking lol
---
RNG-esus is a fickle mistress, but buying a shitty perk is still better than buying no perk because the latter is a waste of of a bloodweb.
---
Oh, I thought it was because he span in a circle.
---
They actually made something that does this for the old reddit view. View this site on "[old.reddit.com](https://old.reddit.com)" and look on the right hand side for the "memeless mode" button. Maybe someone else is aware of a better way to filter out the shitpost flair?
---
I fear the bottom of his pants would rip open eventually.
---
Face a ping is when you stand directly in front of the hook until the survivor dies
---
Haha. Look at the video and you will see my rank. And yes sorry my lord you are the looping pro, I will pray for you.
---
Oh. Thanks for the info. If iw ould have knew it....i would habe made 4/4 with freddy and not 3/4.
---
But cool update.
---
This is how I feel when I get Auto Haven four times in a row.
---
Body-blocking while a valid and altruistic strategy is annoying as hell. So Mori-ing the person doing it, is hella satisfying
---
Oh yeah, get him banned because there was a random desync and he even let him out. 🙄
---
So what this breaks down to is scenarios involving mechanics and scenarios involving emotions. I wrote my response largely because I felt the original post was talking about it being called toxic to play to the mechanics as intended, as such my overall responses. However I do have some stuff to say on the emotion side which I cut out.
---
I honestly do agree with you to a point that intentionally trying to harass people is an assholish thing to do. Picking fights on reddit/post game chat/messaging is just uncalled for and stupid. You're also right in that it's neither the dev responsibility or job to fix, nor is it really in their power to do.
---
However at the same time there is an issue with people being over/under sensitive. I like to play cheeky in real life. My friends and co-workers I do this with also like to play cheeky. Little joke and light ribbing can make things fun. In game if I see someone tbag me at the pallet I'll givem a little head shake or slap at the hook. Not out of revenge, but because I take it as a sign you don't mind playing cheeky to. It's funny to hook that last survivor over the hatch, but it's hype as shit when they pull off that 4% unhook/deliverance and Kobe into the hatch. I feel a lot of problems would go away if people just took these things with better humor, but I understand that some people can't which as I said I only play this way if they play first.
---
Don't get me wrong though insensitivity is a problem to. I've seen people on this subreddit defend racial/homophobic slurs as venting. Hateful venting in chat shouldn't be tolerated. There are ways to vent that don't involve sounding like a 12 year old neo-nazi throwing a temper tantrum. The argument "it's just words" always come up and the argument becomes a collective waste of time. 
---
Which leads to my conclusion on the emotional side of the toxic argument. Both of these extremes empower each other, using the other sides extremes to validate their extremes. Someone getting way to upset over tbaging is used as a false equivalency to people getting understandably upset over hate speech and threats. Someone defending shouting hate speech and threats is used as a false equivalency to defending tbaging. Then the whole thing trickles down and more reasonable people adopt an unreasonable position. I don't think there is a solution here either. I mean people do this all the time when talking about real social issues that actually matter. *What chance does a fucking video game have.*
---
^(And now I have pretty much said the whole wall of text.)
---
It's mostly angry grunts with the occasional screech.
---
Yeah but you dont really need strat vs rank 20 players they just walk into you.
---
You can try instant down Spirit build : Devour Hope, Haunted Ground, Make Your Choice and NOED. This build is very funny to use and makes survivors very salty 😂.
---
I run Calm Spirit every game so I don’t care if I get a Doctor.
---
yea, you are a p3 claud using the most boring build in the game at rank 20 and not even doing good with it, even with DH you still run shack and safe pallet loops like a dumbass
---
Idk why but I haven’t seen a comment on the Plagues hatch animation, it looks like she dips her toes into the hatch and it closes. Very princess-like just a thought 😂 very different from the stomp animation. (Maybe because if she stomps her leg would break 😂😂😭)
---
Looks like a normal game with someone in the basement against hag
---
Everyone else:.....  
---
Nurse: *DAB*
---
Should’ve made Micheal’s a simple stomp without the arms bending.this one makes him look less strong,same issue with the stun noise.just make him silent and strong like the movies
---
Well its better than waiting for a game half an hour
---
I mean farm or haddonfield?
---
The problem is more your team. It looks like the killer saw someone or scratch marks and knows someone is close so they most likely stayed close
---
Shrek 5
---
I think I remember what a safe vs unsafe pallet is.  Isn't it a pallet you have to break once it is down or you will never be able to catch the survivor?  Basically you can't do that thing where you stand in the middle and try to mind game them?
---
Is semi-safe the same as saying safe in only one direction?  By that I mean when I used to play killer I would intentionally chase them around pallets in the direction that made the pallet "least safe" for the survivor.  Or is semi-safe something to do with bloodlust?
---
I want an edit with that Shania Twain song where it goes “*badaaa dadada DADA* ...lets go girls” and then Plauge slams the hatch with dat leg
---
It’s like the only thing survivors can do that’s not considered toxic to communicate with the killer lol. 
---
Sign of respect IMO. I literally feel so bad killing survivors that do this. It reminds me of my dog dropping her bone in front of me. Go back to teabagging me plz.
---
I always just assume my teammates have "got it" when it comes to saves.  When is the appropriate time to actually peel off an objective and go for the save if I am one of those people less inclined to do so?
---
Bring ruin so you it can buy you some time so you can trap various areas 
---
Other than that I got nothin
---
It's actually beneficial to protect all of them. Make them waste as much time trying to get the totems as possible, then if they finally do get one hope that it is haunted grounds
---
Yea the dedicated servers are supposed to fix this.
---
Try it on bass
---
Burger King Myers op, plz nerf
---
They’ve already said they won’t address DCs until they get their dedicated servers. Until then, we have to put up with the douchebaggery.
---
&gt; Killer meta hasn’t really changed at all.
---
There is one Plague perk people say is good but I'm not so sure.  Apparently it blocks gens at the beginning of the game.  Is that overhyped or actually really good?
---
&gt; When looping a pallet, don’t just keep running around it in circles unless it’s a small loop. Instead, double back/moonwalk where necessary (not repeatedly though)
---
I just attack through and break the pallet after it goes down with most killers.  Is that a bad idea?
---
Did they disconnect?
---
**Hatch closing tier list**
---
S: Nurse, Spirit
---
A: Hag, Plauge
---
B: Huntress, Pig
---
C: The rest
---
Michael should of just stared at the hatch an it closes
---
What does SFW
---
Place traps in weird areas and in grass so people will walk into. Don't focus on setting up all the traps at the start just pick a few up place em at loops then get some kills.
---
The Spirit and Nurse are my favorites

---
I don’t have any friends to play with 🥺
---
I can tell you who would die first. Fucking Clown. He’d be out of breath by the time he even arrived at the fight.
---
I don't play Trapper, but I can tell you what I've seen as a survivor in some of the best Trappers I encountered.
---
1. Place traps in low visibility areas, bushes, tall grass, on the other side of the windows, around the shacks, adjust it to each map
---
2. Use Ruin and maybe NOED if beginner
---
3. Secure your Ruin with a trap so you can always be aware if someone is messing around it
---
4. If you want to trap around a hooked survivor, make it invisible, not just laying down there in front of it
---
The Spirit’s is the best, no question!
---
I change your mind
---
nah the game is
---
The point was, the game is over. Killer would be most likely sitting in front of your hook considering he had nowhere else to go. He would smack you again and re-hook.
---
But, since they changed emblems I believe they can revisit that. Say the survivor unhooks himself being the last one still in the trial. By hitting him again and rehooking, it will be beneficial for killers because it will be more events towards Chaser and Devout. It can be the difference between getting silver or gold, gold or iridescent.
---
These are all wrong for me *except* for the Nurse one.
---
All I got to say is Haddonfield.
---
Its true i got 69 hour bann just 420 hours ago
---
How about you do any research at all?
---
Patch 1.8.0 (26 Oct. 2017): 
---
* Increased wiggle penalty for dropping a survivor from 25% to 33%. The initial intent was to cause killers to drop survivors after dropping them 4 times in a row. Due to recovery rates killers had 5 drops before the survivor was freed. This change should cause survivors to be freed after being dropped 3 times in a row when dropped in quick succession
---
So before this patch, you would drop after your fourth drop, after this patch until recently you would break free after your third drop. like i said.
---
i understand that that WGLF does not have an effect at the match, what i don't understand is why this is such an unbelievable problem to you. 
---
As i've said before, if they want to add some ingame effect to WGLF, i'm fine with that, but if they buff it too much it will just create more problems.
---
So, now you start saying Botany is a weak and useless perk? I'm done arguing with you about balance or perk strenghts as i don't think you know what you are talking about.
---
You can call them a bad killer but they are actually being courteous doing that.
---
I think your on to something...
---
The *'possibly once being unhooked that survivor cannot be hooked on the same hook'* is the only bit I'd have a problem with, but a speed boost after being unhooked would be good same as you have when you get hit by the killer.
---
Slight tweaking to the wiggle system would be good too!
---
Format doesn't work. Why is Myers dating another killer? Why is another killer upset that Myers is checking out Léry's? This plot is fucked, go back to screenwriting 101.
---
Even the spirits animation for closing hatch is op XD
---
That's not how this meme works but it still makes sense. Take my upvote
---
I love Lery's as Billy. Don't at me.
---
I wish I had that mindset. Sadly I’m an empathetic killer, and will always give the last person I find hatch unless they were an asshole.
---
98'7% + 1% = 99'7%
---
Other killers are upset because its a shit map for them. And who says Myers cant date anyone? Why cant he stalk some o that lerys booty
---
Shelter fucking woods.
---
I mean, if I stroll all the way around the map checking 4 or 5 gens and no one saves by the time I swing back by I'd call that patrolling.
---
Personally winning is pipping lol
---
It would be nuts though if you run mettle of man with deliverance and get hooked next to the exit gate
---
Its has been some time since I've seen a casual Tier 2 meme
---
I agree with the wiggle bar, it’s pretty useless unless you’re in a SWF group. It definitely needs an adjustment.
---
yes because not running it significantly reduces your chances of winning. Even if you run a different stalling perk instead, none of them take as little effort as ruin does. Obviously it has high roll and low rolls but yeah overall, it'd be crazy to not run it if given the opportunity.
---
I do this too to allow me to plan out what I'm doing easier.
---
Senpai h-hold me OwO mmmmmmm
---
So, as a Survivor, you'd prefer the killer:
---
1. Hook a victim
---
2. Run to the other side of the map
---
3. Close their eyes, plug their ears, count to 30 and let their prey escape?
---
50% thats way too much mayne 10%-15%
---
Mmmm i love the noise the hooking makes it sounds so.... jelly like mm
---
I realize they want the animation to just be a general thing that'd work regardless of where it was triggered, but GOD I wish someone just kicked the damn thing shut.
---
haha, I didn't realise these were semitransparent. How lucky.
---
To get a BBQ stack you need to interact with other player (and win that interaction). To get this "gen" stack you need to sit in front of gen alone. Do you think it's the same difficulty?
---
Did you not see the jiggles on clown when he closed that hatch, that's at least better than "everyone else"
---
&gt;they dont want to play against same meta billy or nurse everytime but give other killers not even a chance
---
This. Exactly this. Plus, they don't want to face the same meta killers with the same meta perks every round, but continue to run the same meta perk loadout every round themselves.
---
Lol, exactly how is the hatch not a crutch? It rewards you for hiding in a corner for the entire game.
---
If you got a gen done all by yourself that means you were alone for (let's use baseline number) 80 seconds. Killer wasn't chasing you. So how can you say it's not a safe activity?
---
Also, just think what kind of gameplay would this "get BP bonus for a repaired gen" perk promote. Does the term "gen rush" sounds familiar?
---
It's less about the kind of threads I hate, and more so that this kind of post is *[literally against the rules of this subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/wiki/rules#wiki_8._oversaturated_content)*.
---
nObOdY eVeR cLeAnSeS iT uNtIL iT’s ToO LaTe
---
The difference between those objectives is that killer need to win against other player.
---
Yeah I know that, I just find it funny whenever a game does this.
---
Omg I just realized my phone autocorrected Shrek to Shriek 🤣
---
It will be the biggest missed opportunity of the CENTURY.
---
I mean it's a pretty decent map if you're running Amanda's letter Piggy or all-seeing Wraith. 
---
Both are nowhere near as powerful as Michael but they do a pretty good job.
---
I think Steve would be a perfect survivor.
---
I would really only say that is tunneling if your going after the unhooked surv. Breaking chase to go to an unhook is fine.
---
(Map based) put traps on the outside ends of windows
---
*Meanwhile the Survivor is using every single crutch meta perk*
---
I main Amanda and play with bbq/nurse/ruin/and the plague perk that blocks the gens dunno what it's called and add-ons most of the time tampered timer and jigsaws sketch (the one that sets 1 more box on the map. I play in german so I just translated what it's called)
---
Sometimes I switch the gen lock perk with whatever just for fun.
---
Bro patrolling refers to staying in proximity of the hook and making sure that no survivor in your LOS goes for the save, it’s not always bad if you know for a fact that a survivor is close, but most of the times it’s camping.
---
It’s very hard to have a debate on this sub without getting downvoted to oblivion but Idc anymore, I like discussing shit.
---
*exactly*
---
whenever i played legion its always coldwind or father cambells
---
Billy cause one shot ability and his ability has little recharge.
---
...so far
---
They have a low terror radius due to their power, wait until you see Ghostface’s power
---
I like using the purple ones on myself during chases and using the full heals on other survivors.
---
WGLF just needs to be expanded to include more events. Things like picking up/healing other survivors and maybe even completing gens too.
---
Last patch
---
You can drop survivors. I know I just found out myself
---
Ormond. While the middle part of Suffocation Pit is really frustrating, ALL of Ormond is just one big "fuck you!"
---
Also, you can at least see auras and scratch marks on Suffocation Pit.
---
This is adorable.
---
I believe you still can, but I'm not sure.
---
I got a Insta medkit for him dont worry
---
True, but for every game where that happens, there would be a significantly higher number of games where the last survivor is on firsthook but either is not running the right perks or has already used them and the killer and survivor would have to wait out the timer till second stage.
---
People seems to think Billy is better than Spirit because he has an instadown and solely because of that, which just hurts my brain.
---
M supposed to be studying for semestral exams.
---
This subreddit changes moods depending on the time of day and noon cycle. It's why I keep this acct as a mostly DbD only posting acct.
---
When did the terminology for patrolling change? That's not at all what patrolling referred to when I started playing this game back at launch. Patrolling was the exact opposite of camping, hard patrolling being used to refer to when a killer stayed around within TR and soft patrolling being used to refer when a killer was leaving but coming back to check the hook frequently and spending plenty of time handling cleanup duties with pallets and gen stomps.
---
I wouldn't personally dodge 180 but I would if they were 20-30 higher. I get it though lol.
---
getting coldwind as legion is a literal nightmare
---
This. Survivors get a bs amount of BP in general... So I always run WGLF every game eventhough I wont pursue 4 stacks hardcore. And most of the time ill couple it with BT. So at the very least I got 1 dead perk, often 2, all for the sake of a somewhat more acceptable amount of BP -.- acceptable amount, not even good and far from great. Compares to killer BP generation its ridiculous.
---
Ahhh he said it. He said it
---
Did you have to make a comment about this... it wasn't that deep
---
Do we really want to have a conversation about crutches when Killers cried about pallets, the hatch and DS (literally the only defensive move Survivors had - that not all Survivors even used).  
---
You think Michael Myers Leatherface of Freddy whined when Survivors fought back or tried to escape?  They asserted their dominance and came back twice as hard.  Be a better Killer.  Stop crying and started dominating.
---
KYF with non-killer host has always been bugged out.
---
It's the same against a killer with 10 ping though
---
The hardest decisions require the strongest wills.
---
Maybe if we post this every SINGLE day MULTIPLE times BHVR will be FORCED to add it...
---
Then don't be mean and down survivors. Only get brutality and Chase lol
---
Happy to be of use, internet stranger.
---
I love how Hag just slaps the hatch shut.
---
I hear you but being camped is part of a lot of multiplayer games. There's counters to it. Utilize the counters, but ultimately, it's part of the game. And dbd is unequivocally a horror game. Killers are supposed to be feared, particularly in the genre of horror lol.
---
There were two other survivors right fucking there. Camping was justified. I will camp if I know someone's around waiting to unhook, though I'll also try to find them or draw them out.
---
The only other situation where I camp is when a survivor teabags. Then I'll facecamp them and nod the entire time.
---
Certainly doesn't help that what few BP we get for doing gens right now is glitched too, so if you forget to pull off before it pops, you're boned even more until we get another patch. &gt;.&gt;
---
Given it's the MAIN objective of survivors, yeah, you'd think it would have the same, if not more, BP gains than altruism, but apparently not.
---
sandbagging isn't very brown cow stunning...
---
Avoiding the killer who is actively looking for for survivors, kicking gens, pressured skill checks is hard to do at times. Not getting caught is often a skill.
---
There is no such thing as gen rush.
---
Can the survivor open the hatch again (like an exit gate) or is it out of play?
---
i didnt understand why people wanted it
---
but now i do bhvr pls shirtless myers
---
Oooooooh, I thought you were refering to the hatch closing animation.
---
Yeah, he spun in the circle during the tantrum after colliding with a wall!
---
So instead of potentially getting more than 1 kill, you’ll just throw away your entire match? Interesting. The funny part is the other 2 survivors weren’t running around me &amp; were hiding in the corn. So I’m 99% sure that the killer didn’t know they were there. But hey to each your own, just know this, you can’t beat toxicity with toxicity.
---
to be fair it's several pieces of wood
---
Ah yes, the cosmetic we deserve
---
Kool-Aid
---
Found the programmer
---
Big agree. BL is worthless there, and I hate it cuz almost all my mains have it equipped.
---
Well I mean you are being pretty toxic right now... but hey you can’t beat toxicity with toxicity
---
Just close the chat and its all avoided. Or you can say gg and leave, that's what I usually do.
---
Glad to see someone appreciating Plague's legs.

Can she go through stuff ? I didnt think so...wanker.( but seriously no one can top her ability to ignore their defenses while alsi applying insane map pressure.)
---
"OH MY GOD, BRENDA, WE'RE BOTH GONNA DIE!"
---
Rancor is just another badly designed perk that fucks you over for no reason. Let's be real, it was added as another bandaid perk against DS, but now it's just a fuck you to whoever is the obsession.
---
it says wanker in the captions too
---
I’m a spirit main, and billy is better
---
1.  He can fly across the map within 10-15 seconds, faster than any other killer except nurse
---
2.  He can instadown, ending a chase instantly.
---
3.  While spirits ability is very good, it is still limited to you have to track, and against stealth perks her ability is very limited.
---
Spirits mind game ability is really fun, and she’s top tier.  But her lack of movement around the map compare to billy without god tier add ons puts her below billy, along with she has one of the lowest skill floors among killers.  Spirit is better than billy on small maps like haddonfield, the game, and the hospital, but overall billy is better
---
WGLF should be a perk for one. By that I mean it should actively do something, I always suggested that it should give the unhooker a BT effect, like literally just a 5 second endurance, this could make for a safer 2 stacks off of 1 unhook and make the killer torn on going for either person equally as difficult especially if this is combined with BT itself. Especially with the Deep Wound changes, it would add more risk for camping killers and more incentives for clutch saves yet also reward the unhooker plenty for doing so. On a side note, I would also make protection hits more consistent.
---
All scoring categories need at least 1 perk tied to bonuses as well. Killers are fine in this regard except for sacrifice, but that's another topic. Even though it isn't exactly for objective survivors at least have Prove Thyself for that.
---
Make No One Left Behind give bonus altruism points throughout the whole match. Nerf the amount from 50/75/100% to say like 10/15/20% to reflect it being active all game. Also probably a QoL buff to gradually increase altruistic actions as the end of the game draws nearer like say 5% per gen complete up to 25% for the end game to also just make the perk good.
---
Simple No Mither change is give bonus points to survival, I don't think it's too much to ask to get a guaranteed 8k in the category if you're running no mither and escape, and also just get a boost in bp for survival scoring events against the respective killers it applies to.
---
Give Object of Obsession bonus points to boldness, you're purposefully attracting the killer so should be rewarded with such.
---
I think giving survivors an option for each category of points to boost it is a start, as well as giving more scoring events to reward coordinated teamwork and swift gameplay. Reward all living survivors objective points if a gen is complete before the killer hits/downs somebody. So that both the gen jockeys and runners are rewarded through gens. Reward martyrs extra altruism if they get hooked in place of the unhooked shortly after. Reward some survival points if you're the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th to die. etc.
---
Playing efficiently as survivors, especially together should regularly reward 20k+ not the 13k it usually does now.
---

Then capture it from the killer's POV. The fact of the matter is that it has nothing to do the hitbox on the survivor. If anything, I suspect the killer's camera is actually a short distance in front of the killer's model so that when they hit you on their screen it looks like they hit just behind you and whiffed. For that they just need to move the camera or change the swing animations.

Shirtless David main here. He basically glows in the dark.

I see this as an absolute win!
---
My favorite Power Move is to just stand *directly* in front of the Locker I KNOW has a Survivor in it, and just stare at it
---
Mine too &lt;3 Nea as well
---
yeah the reason I like the nerf is because it was just too unfair. I honestly prefer the old ds to current MoM
---
I know it’s not, but I had to say it lol
---
Doctor and Legion, as you said in your post. But if you do not have teachable BBQ you can farm for points with LF but goodluck catching ppl.
---
You mean all the old ones??
---
The Nurse is clearly doing the [bend and snap. ](https://giphy.com/gifs/reese-witherspoon-legally-blonde-ZcCzS4fJ9G4Y8)
---
True
---
Ormond is miserable as survivor or killer.
---
Just do what every other teen does and buy it behind their backs
---
You paid for the game. You chase whoever you want, whenever you want, it's the point of the game. Their goal is to not get spotted by the killer. Don't let them convince you that their mistake is somehow your fault.
---
I used to think they were speaking french when i was little
---
I would but you don't understand these people will fricken slaughter me if they find out.  But thanks
---
I actually thought for the first time „wait, is she wearing high heels?” But nah
---
As a killer, why should I be annoyed because you just lowered the survivors chances of actually surviving?
---
I mean yeah I don't get the points but the ones who suffer from DCing teammates are 90% survivors.
---
[I thought this was someone begging to get a copy of the game, i didn't realise it was real.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n5E7feJHw0)
---
I feel like they should make this change to Wake up! Since wake up already gives that slight bonus and isn’t a good perk. If they changed left behind to what you proposed then there’s absolutely no point in wake up!
---
I’ve been getting better stuff.
---
Looks like a pretty happy ending to me
---
Oh my. Borrowed time...borrowed time is really up on your list, huh?

The best killer for farming is the one you perform the best. 
---
On PC the easiest killer for farming is definitely Nurse because with each hit, you gain bloodpoints in 3 all categories: Hunting, Deviousness and Brutality. On top of that, you have total control over the length of the match. Game is going to quick? Play around a little with survivors. Already reached max points in one or two categories? Just dominate them and end the match. 
---
Doctor is the easier to farm **Deviousness points** but he is easily loopable so, getting points in Brutality can take a while and if you are playing against half decent survivors, your gens will get done fairly quick. Doctor games tend to drag out a lot and you are never in total control of the match. By having a very lengthy match, you will end up playing several minutes at capped bloodpoints in Deviousness and maybe Brutality without having a final word on how long the match will last. 
---
On top of that, people ALWAYS suggest Distressing on Doctor as a farming build. Why? He already earns Deviousness points easily by default, do you want to reach 8k with two shocks? 
---
In conclusion, the bloodpoint gain per hour is higher with the killer you play the best.
---

You know i recently saw a post full of people saying that they thought that the shitless Myers meme was fun at first but is bad now but just look at him he is beautiful.
---
Yup. I don't get to Endgame often, for some reason I always get one or two disconnects despite playing fairly. So no camping or tunneling (especially not the survs with traps, they are free to search for their key)  so the remaining surv are mostly busy with the traps or being chased or whatever so my game end in 3 or 2 gens left to be done and everyone dead. So I made that build for me. Fits the most
---
And then the survivor slowly climbs out of the locker to the right and you just turn around and snag him up, and then he DCs....
---
We need this.
---
Never play D&amp;D or they might think you are a satanist or something
---
This literally doesn't happen anymore since the new Update.
---
Good man, Be careful tho I think they have nurses 😰
---
I see bs hits as killer all the time. Don't act like you don't. I don't have any saved currently, but it's not too hard to find them. Also yea it's not the hitboxes, it's how and when the game starts registering hits.
---
Left Behind was always useless to be honest.
---
I think you mean you succeeded.
---
ruin is a default thing at red ranks, noed is not even used and can simply be counterd as getting all dull totems. Ending a chase on someone because they can loop you on infinite is stupid. their shoulden't be infinites. even if u leave that person theirs 3 other people working on gens, even if u find one on a other section of the map its just gonna be the same thing pallet to pallet. every red rank survivor is skilled and knows how to loop. infinites, jungle gyms, ect. Killer is underpowerd
---
Lmao, that LF
---
Why thank you
---
Balanced landing
---
Who is that?
---
With proper advertising and better gameplay, I think DG could surpass DBD. Unlikely that it’ll happen, but it could.
---
I was about to say I hope it was something that happened to a plague on Lery’s when all 4 survivors crouched walked into the basement and stood at all four hooks
---
In my experience survivors complain about NOED, Franklin's Demise, Spirit Fury and BBQ.
---
Does he even play the game at all?
---
I dont see it as a meta perk. Its a great perk when the killer camps. But i dont agree with it being up on that list. Those perks are the perks that killers complain about the most. Borrowed time is never complained about anymore. I never see it anymore compared to mom or adren or bl.
---
Dont worry I'll just bully the killer with balanced
---
Prove Thyself gives more Bloodpoints for cooperative actions and speeds up generator progression. 
---
Get on a gen with someone else and you'll start raking in BP.
---
&gt; Ending a chase on someone because they can loop you on infinite is stupid. their shoulden't be infinites
---
Infinities don't exist anymore... 
---
Seems to me that you just need to git gud. 
---
&gt;even if u find one on a other section of the map its just gonna be the same thing pallet to pallet
---
Learn how to force them towards an area that has been cleared out of pallets already.
---
Nurse would win, bruh.
---
or seeing two insidious leatherfaces in the basement
---
Yeah ive never heard anyone complain about enduring with spirit fury. Ruin isnt really complained about just annoying when your team cant hit skill checks. And the people who heal within tr and complain about nurses are stupid
---
This format is wrong
---
Bro chill, I wasn't trying to do you like that. I apologize.
---
Monitor and Abuse isn't good on Spirit, except if you run Prayer Beads.
---
I would pay double for this that I paid for the original skin.
---
i was in high ranks and i intentionally deranked myself to rank 14. it’s no fun in high ranks
---
Is he really proud of and demanding a reward for ruining the killer reveal for BHVR? I am not complaining, I am grateful for all the leaks but this is not something you can be proud of.
---
Nice job my dude love ur content
---
MoM is quite strong. If it really annoys you, you can try leatherface it hillbilly. The two of them kinda counter it.
---
Life threatened?
---
A Nurse's Calling, Deerstalker, Hex : The Third Seal, Hex : Haunted Ground.
---
Latency works both ways, fam.
---
Nah
---
the legal battle should be settled soon. it’s about to hit 3 years
---
BHVR with proper advertising and better gameplay on a game they basically butchered in the first place because of a lack of good advertising and good gameplay? I don't think it'll happen tbh. However if the game is better than it was, I'll give it a shot still.
---
As someone who genuinely runs an Urban Evasion, Stakeout, Diversion, and Technician build, this meme hits me right in the soul.
---
*Laughs in Thompson House*
---
Appreciated, friend.
---
Bing bong
---
I'll throw in a couple:
---
* You can "steer" survivors by revving your chainsaw for a second. They will take the nearest turn around an object.
---
* You can keep some more experienced survivors from dropping the pallet on you during loops by revving a little bit as you approach it. They will keep looping instead thinking that you've slowed yourself down too much to hit them (and they don't want to waste a pallet on an instant chainsaw break), but if you timed it right you'll sometimes be able to.
---
* Don't chase for too long if you can help it, go see if you can down people by surprise off of gens. It's a good idea to spin around the map every now and then to look for the gen jockeys.
---
* This one is obvious, but get a good idea of how far you can steer and what kind of tiles you can steer through so you can cover more distance without stopping.
---
* Learn when NOT to chainsaw during chase, if you chainsaw you'd better be pretty sure it's going to land or you'll waste a lot of time, even with maximum cooldown.
---
I'm sure there is much more to add but I don't have a lot of time right now. He's a fun boi tho, and you'll be able to play him up to fairly high ranks (not that I advise playing with those people lol).
---
I really dont like the kick ones, just unoriginal and lazy. How hard is it to make an animation where someone grabs the hatch and closes it? The only really good one was Nurse and Spirit, because they actually did something new. Hag was alright too but she just uses her normal breaking thing.
---
It's most likely a bug I've had spine chill appear on every blood web for 15 times in a row.   With barely any perks on that char, I could of won the lottery 30x over with that luck.
---
"Meta" doesn't mean people complain about it. It means everyone is using it. Which they are.
---
you basically always want to have hex: ruin because it slows everything down in the first 1-2 minutes of the match, giving you plenty of time to set up. enduring, brutal strength, and spirit fury are all good on trapper. i truly hate saying this but NOED is actually very good on trapper
---
Probably a bug, mine didn't disappear til I got rank 3 , and this was like 15 times in a row. It appeared.
---
Shirtless Myers bout to reach tier two clothing 😍

It's def not just survivors, I have been told I'm bad by killers bc I run hope instead of adrenaline

*Is a sweaty Doctor...* &gt;___&gt;;
---
y e s
---
I see you are p2 now but my point still stands, thats a boring build to be using at rank 15. You are not even using dead hard correctly and judging by you're gameplay, you rely on it to much.
---
Read my other responses. I didnt actually play Billy and believe me, there were corn... ALOT OF CORN. I just pulled this image off the web
---
for the same bloody reason you are repairing generators in a realm created by a supernatural being called the entity, don't try to reason with it, as far as you may know the entity cursed those pallets with the blood of a thousand goats, anything is possible.
---
Imagine this...
---
Dead By Daylight 2:
---
Now they finally have Leatherface in the game, there's no need for 2 chainsaw killers. So they give that chainsaw role solely to Leatherface and he can only down one person at a time and that speed dash ability goes to Pennywise. And obviously normal Clown won't be in DBD 2.
---
I've liked every single one of these. Fantastic work!
---
Best comment yet😂😂
---
No one gives a shit that you get red rank, it literally takes nothing but playtime. 
---
Yes, if you're not playing Nurse or Billy/Spirit with the best  add-ons (and get a good map) you're fucked if the survivors are actually really good and try to win. 
---
But I'd say only 10% of your losses at most are because of imbalance, most of the time you could've won. 
---
Conclusion: Get good.
---
These were all great. Good luck with your animations, you are really good at this stuff. Congrats on 100 days.
---
Coldwind farm is actually a pretty good map for Hillbilly because it is very wide open allowing him to make full use of his chainsaw to move around very fast
---
corn still sucks tho
---
Billy and Nurse.
---
Reasoning: If you spend 10 min a Doctor game for 60k BP, you're still getting points slower than a 5 min Nurse/Billy game for 40k. 
---
\+ Nurse and Billy get sacrifice points more consistently, Doctor only gets deviousness a lot, but his other categories are average or even below average.
---
We did not know the Wraith could close the hatch while cloaked. 10/10 would teabag again &lt;3
---
Wdym? I love being able to render bbq useless with no distortion needed
---
I love suffocation pit as killer
---
don't even start on how repairing generators is based on wiggling your hands inside it's orifices, i honestly think you should do some other stuff like find gas, and then pour it in, and then the skillchecks would be you pulling the generator cord trying to start it, with a similar mechanic to starting generators in the last of us, where there is a slider going up and down and you have to hit it just in the right spot, and then it will bounce up the progress bar.
---
Should have left when ya had the chance
---
Pallets are also heavy as fuck
---
My perks for spirit are Ruin, Whispers, BBQ and Infectious Fright.
---
Ruin to slow down the game a bit, Whispers to dont waste time to look for survivors where are none. 
---
BBQ for starting another chase as fast as possible after hooking a person, so you dont waste your precious time.
---
Infectious fright so you can slug someone and chase another one, so someone else has to come pick the guy up on the ground another one is in the chase and there is max 1 guy working on a gen. People may complain but slugging is a valid tactic and needed in high ranks versus good survivors. If you just down and hook and so on, you gonna lose.
---
I like the addons they increase the phase duration and speed but also the faster activation time is really nice.
---
A lot of people recommend stridor on spirit but I think its a waste of the perk slot, when you are using headphones you can hear the survivors anyway.
---
In case you cant hear them(they not injured/Iron Will) watch the ground you can see the gras/corn etc moving. Also sometimes it helps just to stand still for couple seconds and pretend to start to phase often the survivors stop running and try to hide -  now you know where they are trying to hide and you can phase there and get an easy hit.
---
Lol I didn’t die, in fact we all escaped.
---
Overcharge, surveillance, thrill of the hunt and huntress' lullaby
---
Starts off a bit slow, but when it works they wont get more than 2 gens done
---
I'm rank 14 right now so it may not work at higher ranks
---
Clown needs the Borat. You know the one. Make it happen.
---
Thank you this really helps
---
lol it’s surprising
---
Ugh. Dabbing is so 2018.
---
I fucking love MST3K
---
My friends was trying to be toxic is all. It ended up being a hilarious moment for us.
---
You're going to get it eventually, so just buy it now. I gotta deal with Shadowborn popping up in the web when there's still a dozen more perks that I'd rather get than that.
---
Hey 2018 is so last year
---
Doesn’t mean anything more than likely, they usually don’t. BHVR always uses country names for their chapters.
---
He could definitely see him, it was a Wraith.
---
I agree. At least let me Mori them. [I actually made a thread about an idea](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bpiqxj/can_dcd_survivor_bodies_stick_around_so_we_can/?st=jvvep8je&amp;sh=090b4c55) I had where a DC'd survivor goes into Dying State and has their aura revealed so the killer can choose to Mori or hook them at their preference.
---
What a dumbass shit like that makes me chuckle at the Idiocracy
---
Thanks, I was skeptical with it and I was wondering wether to change it to 5/10/15%
---
Can confirm. If YOU'RE the guy who crashed your offering isn't refunded which feels like salt in the wound.
---
Clown just bores me
---
Damn this one's my favorite lol.
---
That's the most common achievement on The Internet, 98.9% of all users have it.

True. I guess what I’m missing is why? Why are people mad at him?
---
Yep, as someone who plays Spirit a lot I wish they would remove this addon or make it at least an ultra rare one.
---
You sure cause u see that a lot from my teammates when I play survivor when we are at the exits and they do that when the killer is somewhere else
---
Im neutral on it..it could be cool i guess but it could also be really bad.
---
I aim for the middle game myself, my endgame is not to bad. I need to improve on the early game personally!
---
You will get them, we believe in you!
---
AFAIK purple thicc mist offering is the max. Running 4 or 5 of them doesn't make it any thicker.
---
&gt;it’s an opinion he’s presenting as a fact
---

---
Last time you saw someone use PWYF not doing a meme build with more than 100h?
---
I personally **never** saw PWYF being used at rank 1 in 800+h at mostly red ranks
---
But hey man, that's just my opinion, I could be wrong, maybe I saw it once or twice and I can't remember
---
Pips.
---
Depip = loss, black pip = draw, +1 = win, +2 = Much win.
---
That is the official declaration of "winning" in DBD, as stated by the developers. 
---
The community has their own personal views of winning. Some think escaping/4K is winning, others think that getting X amount of BP at the end is winning.
---
I usually just give a "lol @ noed" at the end. I can't help it. That perk annoys me, I'm not mad at it, I just heavily dislike seeing it, even more so than Ruin. But if it works for the killers and it's worth a perk slot for them, then I'm not going to give them outrageous amounts of shit for it.
---
It'll fall off later on, but hey; Play how you like. If you're having fun then habe fun!
---
Bubba's looked a little... different.
---
Because it's The Internet and Someone is always mad at Anyone and that applies to Everyone.
---
Oh no, my point was that even 5 percent is totally game changing. Gaining a 15 percent speed per gen would make it so that killer is almost twice as fast as survivors, and winning games would be difficult. However, this has a nice idea and would be balanced if it was something more like 1-2 percent
---
Something tells me you didn’t double pip
---
Clown isn't a flashy Killer. His power is mediocre. People just find him boring.
---
You need to have a special connection with Clown in order to enjoy playing him. I would know because I mained Clown since he came out.
---
Why even bother to reply if you’re not going to answer my question? Being a smart ass isn’t cute. Have a nice day.
---
Oh I see, yes I think that works best
---
"Whatever, we'll just go create our own gang, we'll call it.... Legion"
---
Survive With Friends
---
Really? Well thats disappointing.
---
Please retract my earlier statement...
---
Yep I just got Freddy and oh boy I'm enjoying him I can't wait for the rework so he's actually good. He could have amazing cosmetics also so yeah I'm a Freddy main now.
---
Oh shit, the Spirit has a cool one. Was half expecting her to just use the normal slash she does on pallets.
---
Swamp, I can't see fuck-all and for the love of God how the fuck get through those ship/house/Hell hole mazes...
---
Depends on whether or not there are small wooden boards in the fighting area.  If there’s one wooden pallet that’s a game end for at least a few of them, because as we all know, pallets are stronger than any killer
---
Id give you a silver but im broke
---
1:40. Have you ever heard of a perk called 'Nurse's Calling'?, it could be a range of other perks that sold you out, for instance dark sense, bbq and chilli, whispers, or spies from the shadow and a whole bunch of other perks.
---
Why does everyone call him Frozone when he introduced himself, like, 20 minutes into the movie?
---
I mean it’d explain why she’s so tall...
---
Or maybe it's Jason in a new medium for more people to enjoy. they still have Jason, we get him too
---
Well if you’re new you will be matched with newer players as well. Things you will want to learn how to do well is loop/counter-loop depending on if survivor or killer. Another thing to look out for is this community is very toxic, so have thick skin if you want to play.
---
Doctor for sure is the top.  I haven't seen anyone mention him but you clean up with Freddy too.  I probably average 28K or more with him in my games.
---
Killer is a team of 1 survivors are a team of four
---

---
true

I mean, it was all in good fun. It was the highlight of our night lol.

That happened to me, preventing adept doc
---
I was playing spirit for a daily, and 2 people ex’s after one person got hit. Me and the other two farmed, and I let them out. I got nothing but compliments from them.
---
Franklin’s Demise gg
---
Playing any other killer is just begging to get bullied by survivors. I love playing peppa pig but she’s just not viable against 4 smart survivors.
---
And what do they usually say afterwards?

Not anymore. It only unlocks the ability to sabo at 50% the normal speed. Look it up

yooo lol THIS GABE IS THE GOAT
---
Would definitely recommend. The game matches you with players close to your level. There is a separate level/ranking for Survivor and Killer, 20 being the start and 1 being the top level/rank. 
---
It’s a fun game. I would suggest to try to not let toxic in game chat ruin the game for you. People can cry and complain a lot, and some times you might have someone coming at you for no reason. Ignore the trolls and enjoy the game! :)
---
I know that. I was saying if it did that then it would be better
---
For survivor, Swamp, Lery's and Spirits map.  For Killer Haddonfield, Ormond, Spirits Map.
---
My mans just lost 200 karma 😂
---
When there’s two gens left, there has to be 2 survivors I believe before the hatch becomes visible.
---
lMy parents know I can handle it but they don't want me to see a dead body as an average thing. Thanks for the support man, best wishes
---
Oh yea no doubt it’s useless now for sure. We need some reworked perks
---
Am I that new ? I require explanation
---
It does not *spawn* until either 3 people die or the special spawn conditions are met, which you should read. It does not even *exist* prior to that.
---
miss luigi
---
There are 4 survivors and 1 killer. The killer has to work more then the survivor. However, both survivor and killers can get 32k.
---
I Love the Nurse's perspective when you close the hatch. She uses the force to close it.
---
Spirit though...oh man, that's a unique one, especially when he sword stays there.
---
So i'm not the only one that does that!
---
You know what's funny? I've had it happen to play leatherface or other weaker killers on high ranks, no ruin or anything, just chase, down, hook, move on to the next dude and maybe in the end most or all escape cuz sometimes I don't care about kills, just thrill of the chase. 
---
But get this - survivors would then call me fuckin bad for playing those weak killers at high ranks. I'll just play how I see fit to have fun so whatever, but imagine how many other killers might take that as an invitation to tryhard.
---
Happened to me twice last night, once when I wasn't the one failing to load and once when I was. New update isn't perfect by a long shot my man.
---
That makes absolutely no sense. Both have the work the same amount. The idea is that it’s balanced. Why should I spend the same amount of time in a game and make considerably less? It’s not like survivors sit in a corner and do nothing. As someone who plays 50/50, killer is not any more work than a survivor.
---
I'm a leathercamp main when I play killer. You are 100% wrong about everything you said. Also, the reason pips matter is because the worse survivors you face, the more successful camping is.
---
there's a vague matchmaking system and while it's not perfect it means you won't be matched with top tiers right away.
---
And, honestly the learning curve isn't that huge. the game is more balanced around thinking under pressure than aiming specifically or anything like that. so it's very easy to pick up.
---
I mean they could’ve holded out the game for 30 minutes so what do you prefer
---
It's pure luck if they can find it honestly. And if you find it first and close it, they're fucked no matter what so.
---
Lol no
---
The killer is the host. Lag benefits the killer 90% of the time.
---
I sincerely hope this is a joke.
---
1v1 are now, as it should be, killer sided. Whoever finds the hatch first gets to use it one way or the other, that's fair, isn't it? 
---
If you feel like you're going to die without that 4k, just slug.
---
3 gens will lead to a 3 kill game if the survivors play optimally, which most of the time they will because most survivors aren't SWF.
---
Best feeling in the world is when a survivor is working on a gen and sneakily jumps out a window to avoid you but gets trapped instead.
---
Survivors are breaking up tasks between 4 of them but killer has to do all the work on their team. Seems pretty obvious to me
---
Oh yeah, and make sure you're not leaving scratch marks leading strait to the locker you're hiding in, DWIGHT.
---
Honestly?
---
I was you 3 weeks ago. I love horror. I've been eyeing this game for a long time. I decided to finally pick it up. It was so much fun for a few days. Then... the nature of the DbD community started showing itself - for some reason this game brings out the worst in people. Sore losers, sore winners, trolls, death threats, and be prepared to put your Steam/PS4/Xbox profile to private because you 100% *will* get death threats sent to you personally. If you set your account to private, they will still send you friend requests which you can ignore, but they'll try to find other ways to track you down and harass you (that is not everybody - probably like 5% of the community). But it's safe to say that this game is divided by half polite people and half absolutely toxic disgusting humans.
---
Should you get this game?
---
If you have thick skin then sure. If not, I'd suggest you try to force yourself to play extremely casually and not take it seriously at all because once you buy into the extremely competitive nature of this game, the toxic people of the community will destroy your sanity.

If they (the group) did a Gen, I wouldn't care...but literally they swarmed my Totem and Hooks and nothing got done.  I didnt even camp...and it's still freely available for them to find?  That's what upsets me
---
I dont exactly have this problem per say. Though i always seem to stay up like an extra hour on the weekends cuz of youtube
---
Ghostface is realizing in June
---
I do play them both 50/50 and you must realize it’s 4v1. The game is always in the survivors favor. The only way the survivors lose is if they make a mistake(unless it’s a god nurse). The way survivors always win is gen rush. The killer is left by himself trying to hunt down 4 people.
---
*slow claps* 
---
Yea, it is a joke to get rewarded for doing nothing in a match.
---
And when i play, (Not even trying to hit them with a chainsaw once): "That's it! I'm gettin' me mallet!"
---
True, but this one I can't answer for you for deranking is just as difficult to ranking up, if not moreso.
---
That is simply not true. It was never an S tier perk but it definitely had its own niche. Now it is not best tier perk nor does it have it's own niche. It needs a buff.
---
This. Slug is your friend.
---
Sabotaging is so useless these days...
---
honestly the pretty leatherface would be cool
---
I like Joey giving a piggyback ride to susie, Its real cute
---
I wish we would get more item cosmetics. Something we could just equip and always use like character skins. Untapped market imo.
---
3 Blink + range Nurse : Am I a joke to you ?
---
They’re sooooo adorable!
---
*frantically looks around to make sure he’s not stalking you*
---
Man, the Spirit's is cool af. Not that I'm not super grateful to have hatch closing now, but I wish all the killers' animations had as much character as the Spirit's and Nurse's...
---
So killers complain about hatch standoffs, get EGC (which greatly levels the field of whoever finds it first basically wins) and you’re still mad? Let’s be real here, it’s because you didn’t get a 4K.
---
It's 2019, it's now a pretty even split between that and having sex with your dad.
---
Cue frantically looking around to make sure he’s not stalking you
---
These are awesome. Good work!
---
What a crybaby bitch
---
That's an awesome looking costume, where'd you get the mask if I may ask. Or did you make it yourself?

/r/confusedboner
---
So why bother wasting any time playing as a survivor? Why spend 30 minutes a game working to stay alive only to get shafted on points? 
---
I will never understand this poor me killer mentality. They’re literally designed to do all tasks at once, while survivors are designed to work as a team to survive. If one survivor puts the team on his back then why should he not get rewarded for it? People act like the killer is some poor alone sob but that’s literally the point and design of the character, and doing what the character is supposed to do, IE, chase, down, and hook survivors, is no harder than doing what a survivor is supposed to do, IE gens, and avoiding killers. 
---
Survivors do not pool points, they don’t survive individually, but they still spend considerable time doing objectives and playing the game just like the killer. 
---
It isn’t some chore to play as a killer and do “more tasks per individual” which I would argue makes no sense, as they probably have less tasks to actually accomplish. They are literally designed to be faster, more capable, and have more abilities. I have had far more successful games as a killer than I have ever had in a group as survivor, so I can’t see how people can argue this unless they have never played survivor before.
---
You need to try this : 
---
Ruin + Surveillance + Discordance + Monitor and Abuse + Prayer Beads + Mother Daughter Ring.
---
Am I the only one who thinks instahealing is so satisfying? It's the same feeling of hitting 5 Ruin skills checks in a row.
---
Not my work tho :D thank Feary and Happy Clown. I only combined them
---
Followed by the realization that Myers was stalking you
---
Agreed, I think itll be better once we get dedicated servers
---
Not sure why it's true, failing a healing skillcheck is an easy way to get out of the dream state.
---
Have you ever wanted your flashlight to look prettier as you buttdance in front of a pallet using the flashlight on the killer. Now you can! This genius invention can be yours TODAY! for only 59.99 auric cells. (This commercial cannot and will not be held responsible for any customers getting tunnel and/or facecamped as a result of our product)
---
This sounds nice, wish there was a feature or something
---
Okay but you're only complaining, because you didn't get 4k, since nobody else, but the killer benefits from survivors doing nothing and basically handing themselves over to you. 
---
You have several options: Slug, find the hatch first and close it or find the survivor before they find the hatch.
---
I don't think that 4k is the only way to "win" as a killer, but hey, everyone has their own definiton of that.
---
waaaaahhh
---
Ok
---
I call it baiting. My guilty pleasure is I hide and I'm like "Ok just mutilate her white ass and leave !"
---
69 levels into Myers (one prestige). I have yet to see Monitor and Abuse. It’s cold here … so very cold 🥶.
---
Yes, because a longer animation is totally not gonna get old when playing killer
---
I always cleanse totems when I'm playing survivor because the BP is pretty good. 600BP for 14 seconds.
---
I don't run NOED, but if I did, I wouldn't even care if it didn't trigger. The point is that survivors were doing something aside from gens while I chased people around.
---
I mean... every killer has the basic same design philosophy if you look at it that way...
---
Legion has an ability that lets then excel in situations where the survivors are grouped 
---
Plague excells at keeping survivors off of objectives
---
I literally do not see your comparison between the two
---
Not to sound cheesy, but I am legitimately looking forward to what you do next. I will be watching for your animations!~

---
Jesus this mentality is so fucked. Assuming one or two players is killed, the survivors will absolutely do as much as a killer. There’s a reason why it’s 1v4, because if it was 1v1 the survivor would never win. The whole point of 1v4 is because you need 4 people in order to actually complete all the tasks require with a chance to survive. 
---
What do killers do that’s so difficult? Hold W and press mouse 1? It’s not hard to find a survivor, there’s certainly no more instinct involved in being a killer than there is a survivor, certainly the same for anticipation, and absolutely skill. If you’re going to sit there and try to say that being a killer requires more skill I’m going to laugh right out of this chat. Both absolutely require skill, and depending on what kind of killer you are and what strategies you use getting a 4K game can be downright easy. 
---
Killers don’t need to cleanse anything, they’re already more powerful than a survivor and faster, and any time a survivor spends cleansing anything is a win for the killer. They don’t need those perks, because the can’t even get hurt. I don’t get the argument at all here. Eat a sandwich and play? Jesus go play as survivor before trying to have an argument about something you know nothing about.
---
I'll still be here in spirit, dear one. &lt;3
---
But that's literally their only objective
---
Exhaustion still kills this perk idea. 
---
Don’t know why people think it should be nerfed AND exhaustion be added to t.
---
You need to double pip as killer now and as survivor hatch does not count you have to escape through the exit gate. Maybe thats the problem?
---
LOL I did not see the Blackwatch crew coming at all in this.
---
Very nicely done!
---
I did escape through the exit gate
---
Gotcha, I was confused since you added exhaustion times
---
I love it as well. I especially love the sound of a screeching Claudette getting hooked the 2nd time.
---
Listen I've been trying to get that 100 traps achievement for weeks and desperate times call for desperate measures
---
Simon Rex used to be a porn star. He was pretty good.
---
God that mask was fucking beautiful. My second favorite of the franchise besides the first, obviously.
---
God I never want to do Retribution Legendary again
---
:)
---
Adrenaline makes you exhausted and it's a one time use perk.
---
You can't be grabbed anymore
---
Yes
---
By far the coolest one in my opinion
---
Leatherface animation looks pretty weird. Too much 360s.
---
It would ignore Exhaustion, like Adrenaline, I forgot to add that to the perk.
---
You could maybe theoretically survive for a little bit with a meat hook through you if it didn't hit any viral organs and maybe like pierced a bone or maybe strong muscle as to hold you so your body's weight wouldn't pull so much on the meat hook and cause further immediate damage. I mean Phineas Gage survived for many years after  a rather big rod pierced his head (although his personality was said to have changed) so it definitely wouldn't be the weirdest thing that has happened. No excuse for Hillbilly running at that speed with a chainsaw though except "entity" .
---
Sometimes its bugged on survivor side. had to escape with quentin 3 times to get the achievment.
---
Agree, Legendary is way too hard. Glad I could play all heroes.
---
Out of all my myer games I’ve never ran into that, not even once. To many scaredy cats
---
You are awesome
---
Better than Super Spencer.
---
Haha true he may not he the BEST, but he definately is quite a bit of fun:)
---
 no, but in fact in that dev-build there wasn't only ghostface, there were many new features including "charms", it was v3.0.0
---
we can already burn Offerings for free
---
No. What happens back in the day is the survivor hides for however long he wants
---
It seems that we agree the killer is doing the work of 4 people, but you don’t like how the points are awarded for survivors. Which is fair.
---
I think the devs are reworking the emblem system so that survivors can earn more points when they are stuck doing 1 thing all game like being chased. That would be nice
---
you could help it but u decide not to, mate\^\^
---
I actually wanted to ask about this. I tend to just spin in circles waiting for them to wiggle free in hopes they know I'm not trying to hook them. So if I drop them and pick then up again it helps them wiggle faster and has a point reward?
---
I know a lot of people may not see it but what about a man pig? Maybe we could be like John Kramer as the pig that probs will never happen but I think it would be cool
---
If you've ever played L4D, I just picture Vile Purge working like Boomer Bile, and Corrupt Purge working like Spitter Acid. Whatever she's spitting with Corrupt Purge is a highly corrosive substance.
---
By “just dies” you mean crouching around the map for 30 minutes?  Got it.
---
In End Game Collapse every killer is the stongest if they finds the last survivor before they open a gate, not just Freddy. No hate, bro, I just don't understand your video here.
---
Nope, dies, as in the entity murders him
---
Old memes actually changed the picture with proper edits
---
Nowadays is just a title
---
After 30 minutes right, cause that’s how 90% of my games went when there was one survivor left and 4-5 gens
---
It only blocks if you hook once exit gates are open sorry mate.
---
If someone's on the hook before then it doesn't count
---
I love this!
---
No u have to hook after the gate/s opens
---
I'm not going to lie I won't become a James main almost instantly
---
Nice. I saw Huntress x Pig stuff on Instagram before, so I thought they could be cute couple.
---
No, I escaped through the exit gate and I got no achievements
---
I almost never escape as the last survivor with EGC.  I feel it is HEAVILY weighted for the killer, since they have the kind of movement speed and the doors are usually not far away.  It's impossible to get the dang gates to open without a killer just chillin. 
---
Idk, maybe the killer shouldnt get to hear the hatch?  Or maybe it be quieter?
---
so annoying that the hatch isnt an easy escape anymore and that the Killer now actually benefits from finding the hatch first!!!! Absolutely unfair!
---
Why is having the opportunity to strategize such a bad thing? Why are there so many requests to remove what little end-game strategy Survivors can have? 
---
&gt;it gives survivors too much control, too much of an advantage
---
How? As a killer, you can go whack a gate and open it instantly at any time you like.
---
MmMmmMMMmmMmm  yesssss it’s a sound I just... can’t r-resist *blushes*
---
"Regurgitation &amp; desperation. Enjoy your *cure* MWAHAHAHAHAHA!"
---
Laurie not toxic? I wish I could live in your world
---
It has to be AFTER the gates open. Hook someone after the gate are open.
---
Youre wasting your time. I agree with you 100% but this comminity is autistic and says shit like oh its 1v4 thats why, which is a non sequitor. It really is amazing how mother fucking dense people can be. You want the real answer? Because they do. Because there is no good answer. Because “killers more stressful so they need more points” its all bullshit.
---
I love the way he squats mmMmmMmm
---
Just avoid doing 360 and toxic montages
---
Other then that have fun and good luck!
---
I had a pig dc cause she hit me and her noed didn't go off cause we got all the totems. Lol
---
It kinda says that in a confusing way I just wasnt sure cause I couldve swore I remember hooking someone and then the exit gates opened after and it still worked
---
Mine never went that long, 10-15 tops but it's whatever now.  I'll just have to deal with it as this will probably stay.  But I fundamentally dislike it
---
true because he has that OP 7 Second delay before he can Hit anyone with a basic Hit at Basic movement Speed. So awesome
---
Why use self care if you're bringing in a medkit?
---
I literally can't. The laws of the universe won't let me. Don't talk about shit you don't know.
---
Level 50 Survivors with insta-heals - “Haha, you’re shit”
---
Level 11 Freddy trying to get dailies - ”Uh huh”
---
What? The hatch shouldn't spawn until 2 gens are done/1 Survivor remains.
---
&gt;	people don’t realize how easy it is
---
Look man you don’t get to just say untrue things and act like you’re sharing knowledge
---
Makes zero sense. The problem is that killer mains tend to never play survivors, and have no clue what is required. I can honestly say that being a killer is no different than a survivor, in fact it’s easier because they have the biggest advantage of all, they don’t have to rely on others to win. Survivors for the most part only as good as their worst player.
---
Ups heal speed, and I have an abundance of them but no other perks I was super feeling like using
---
how about a small Regression after 30-60 seconds
---
He was camping but it was the correct play in that situation.
---
Trust me it is not as bad as having to deal with an immersed Survivor who wanted to punish you for some arbitrary reason because you broke one of their personal Survivor rules.
---
Unlike endgame collapse it doesn't last 4 minutes it lasts until they're damn well ready to leave.
---
I once had a Nea stay in the game after the exit gates already been open for almost 2 hours because she was annoyed that I double trapped her as Amanda and tunneled her other friend.
---
Obviously Speedo Quintin is the best skin
---
Yeah dbd has got enough of that
---
You're *right!* Why WOULDN'T I want to waist my time while the killer picks his nose waiting on the bleedout timer? I should be more considerate to all those Killers out there who are just looking to have a good time, and *definitely* aren't trying to be toxic
---
I’m gonna start doing this more often. Thank you. I forgot that you can close the chat lol
---
Mask is from Trick or Treat Studios. I have it myself, and it's awesome.
---
A year ago the guy who has the rights to Ghostface or something like that (not sure) told this dude he could reveal that Ghostface would be released in DBD whenever it happened
---
He was supposed to do it on may 28th,but BHVR did an oopsie and leaked a dev build after the last PTB ended, confirming Ghostface to all of us
---
Because the tweet announcing the announcement was made on april 1st lots of salty people went to his twitter to harass him because it could just be an april fools joke
---
I respect what your parents are trying to do
---
But you can allways have a taste of dbd if you really want to
---
Do you got any friends that own the game?
---
What they need to do is simply remove the limits and put in a blanket point max. There’s no reason to punish killers and survivors for doing something they have to do. If I have no choice but to knock out 4 gems why should I not get the points for that?
---
Did you pip at all? I got the achievement for ash the other night. I got to use each perk once during the match and I got a +1 pip and unlocked it. On xbox.
---
I feel like they should make some changes to the game when it comes to the final survivor:
---
- Gates should not spawn close to each other.
---
- Gates no longer show progress 
---
- Closing the hatch should NOT cancel the animation of the survivor and pull them back out.
---
- If the last survivor gets caught the bleed out timer should be reduced significantly in order to prevent unnecessarily long wait times. 
---
Changes to the killer side:
---
Kills by the entity during the collapse should either not give any points to the killer at all or give less points than a normal sacrifice. 
---
This will avoid scenarios where the killer refuses to do anything and make sure the killer hooks the survivor instead, ending the game as quickly as possible. If a killer is carrying a survivor when the timer ends, the survivor will not be dropped automatically so that the killer has time to bring the survivor to a hook. Dropping them or breaking free will kill them instantly.
---
Well, others people complain about protection hits being buggy, because they don't get them even when they should. And for 3 protection hits you need to waste so much time, that the extra hit isn't worth it.
---
because EVERY Player and their mother will wait 2 minutes just to piss YOU off.
---
Life is hard
---
Dabbing or blinded by P3 Claudette squad.

True. But sometimes I really just want to understand why they do it. But it never really works in my favor I guess.
---
But this already exists?

Has it been confirmed that ghostface is just a paragraph?
---
The people in the DG community are hyped as hell, as am I, so I’m curious as to what they do.
---
Hmmmmmm
---
They apparently fixed the PS4 bug of false overheats! That made me happy, because I usually had to turn off my PS4, let it rest for a while, then turn it on, go straight into the game, mash X like a madman and hope the console wouldn't say it overheated and crash my game. Now I can just decide to play something before DBD, and that makes me happy.
---
And why would only the red ranks have a 5th perk and not everyone else?
---
when it's day 100 and you can't wait for these shit unfunny templates that no one uses to fuck off
---
10-15 minutes is around 1 game so if you’d like to have 1 kill or play another game that’s just dumb.  You have to find the hatch first and you pretty much win
---
Honestly I rather this happened and then have them spend a good 2 hours not doing anything because they're too afraid to touch gens
---
don't come back
---
It depends on the font. If it's too small my eyes hurt
---
Interesting.
---
I guess if I'm playing a killer that can get hard looped I'll ignore them if I acknowledge they are better than me and actually have loops nearby, but I usually end up just trying to down that player and "tunneling" them as I would rather have non-jerk survivors be higher ranks and I don't feel guilty tunneling what I consider to be toxic survivors. If all you care about is "winning" then yeah it is best to leave them alone or try to catch them later especially since these tend to be cocky players and can still be caught off guard.
---
why not both? :)
---
NANI?!
---
The screams followed by the juice fills me with life

Haha youre shit then, u can kick the hatch dumbass
---

At least you're true to your name. I personally get the protection hit scoring even all the time. It's like safe unhooks, it doesn't show up right away.
---
Yeeees... with the Ratchet sounds when you *clearly* don't have a ratchet.
---
Also: I like your ideas.  Find gas, find a *key* to open the gas cap, finding cords, oil for lube on the EXPOSED pistons... *then* the fidgeting while your molesting your strange &amp; external piston gennie would not seem so, queer.
---
THIS
---
Nooooo
---
Most of the time I running no one escapes death I never run ruin (or any other hex) along with it I want to actually get to endgame
---
Worst case scenario I might run haunted ground but that's about it
---
Then the noobs have no fun, though, because the killers are ten times better then them, its like an intentional rank reset. You most likely encourage them to only use good perks to counter yours so even then theirs no variety.
---
If you use double spacing and size 12.5 font you might be able to make it fill a page

Sole Survivor likes to toy with Scratched Myers.
---
Ah, fuk. Dont i feel like a twat. Went looking for it and couldnt find it. That's hella buried. Now i get to leave my post here in shame.
---
A Fog Whisperer said there will be no survivor, and they only have the mask license.  The so called leaked Map Offering is an old unused fake out for a killer called The Teacher.
---
This week I was playing Killer, and when all the gates were powered, I found the last survivor trying to open it and smacked him, leaving him Injured. He just stood there, gestured at the gate and I let him have it, just smacking him one last time before he escaped for those bloodpoints.
---
He sent me a message on PSN later on saying gg and thanking me, and it was a nice change from all the toxic shit we go through. All the toxicity of the players actually get to me, so it is nice to find someone willing to just be a sport.
---
-crie-
---
💋 luv you too boo
---
I love how after the close it they just instantly turn to Feng 😂
---
That's camping, he doesn't have any reason to be there, even if he saw scratches literally no one was running around leaving more, so he just stayed because he could
---
Me and Dwight would've been satisfied with some uncommon med kits, right? *And he springs this serious gourmet shit on us!*
---
Stake out is a meta perk in my eyes
---
what makes you think i’m 10 times better than them lol. i deranked intentionally because i’m trash at high ranks. i don’t even know how i got there in the first place. plus rank 14 isn’t really noobs
---
All good! If you haven’t used the Help &amp; Tutorials section before, it’s easy to forget it’s there. :)
---
Yep. Those loops are way too long. Balanced Landing makes the map basically unplayable. I completely understand if a Killer wants to DC on this map.
---
The only thing this taught me is i still want huntress to step pn me
---
when it’s your 30th account in an attempt to dodge a ban
---
Oh god no...
---
This game isn't even stable on pc and console plus it's already a huge grind fest, with a mobile adaption in the pipes it bet it will even get worse.
---
Honestly who asked for this?
---
Usually higher rank equals more skill, but I can understand if its not. 
---
I swear I can get to rank 10 just by playing good as killer.
---
i love dead meat!
---
even how much i love Laurie, most of the players who play her are unbelievable toxic lmao
---
It could definitely use a facelift imo. And some more details. Like how exhausted doesnt recover while sprinting
---
Nothing is wrong with being empathetic in my opinion. If a survivor DCs while at low ranks I'll sometimes just get survivors dead on hook and let them go since you can still easily pip up (as long as you hold gens for a bit). If you do this make sure you still damage them every time you get in a chase (for challenge/excitement and chaser emblem) but you can just drop them and leave them to get healed or let them escape your grasp (neither of which hurt your blood points or emblems). You can also still feel like you won if you down them all after they get dead on hook.
---
Don't, come back\*
---
FTFY
---
This is amazing
---
I was hoping they would actually pull the lever down,  it was really disappointing
---
As somebody who is pretty bad but sometimes gets this treatment, thank you.
---
Late
---
Aw damn. Well, was pretty fun while these posts were around, can't wait to see what else you make in the future!
---
LOL.  I saw a video of someone seeing Dwight enter a locker, then placing a trap directly in front.  I did that, and it was STUPENDOUS seeing him 5 minutes later (Kawing Crows &amp; all) step out &amp; trap himself.
---
I let him live in the end.
---
Same here. I love the H20 mask as well, mainly because it showed his eyes. I found it unsettling.
---
A ding ding ding
---
S-st-stop you’re making me all.. hot n bothered ;3
---
yeah, imma need that dlc money back then. we should try to get it, and if a lot of people does it steam maybe oblige it.
---
I had one perk as Billy yesterday, got 3K tho. The one survivor says “Shit Billy is shit” and I was like... well yea it’s my third game with him. He then went on a tangent about many things and called me “classless”
---
No fuck them for calling you a tryhard, run that small game. That's literally what most of us killers want you to do. If you're spending 60 seconds clearing the maps of totems, thats fucking one less gen that pops before we catch the first fuckface. Whatever salty killer gave you shit for that fuck em, he got more time to suck, and you dodged NOED thats a fair exchange.
---
yes i agree, i play killer mostly because getting bp as survivor is such a grind
---
Yes you can keep leveling up the bloodweb for perks, items and offerings
---
Didn't the person who was supposed to announce it said there will be a map and probably a survive?
---
Sorry I'm on mobile so can't find the source right now.

Are you saying that leather daddy isn't pretty already?

The only ones of your list that I was aware of before I started playing dbd are Jason and the Thing, and Jason's not possible at the moment. (Also Imhotep, but I wouldn't consider him to be a horror character in the same way that the others are.)

Got a download link on this post :)

Never has for me. I'm not saying it takes 10 seconds like safe u hooks, but it's usually 2 seconds after I'm hit tell show up.
---
From what I've seen in recent Kill Counts, either he plays DbD or is familiar with the mechanics.
---
Here you go!  
---
Here's the perks, sorry for the wait!  
---
"OMEGALUL" "BABY KILLER" "LUL" neckbeard language has been spoken
---
if you get the perk and get it to tier 3 it will stop showing up😂
---
Rank reset brings out all the SWF groups
---
Everytime you drop them and pick them back up again a quarter of the wiggle meter is added onto the amount the survivor has already wiggled for. If adding a quarter of the meter upon dropping a survivor would fill the meter the survivor will instead break free of your grasp. The survivor then recieves a bp bonus, not the killer.
---
I want a tear mask purely because they would cry hearing about the nerf.
---
Is there even really a community when the game has 0 players online?
---
I'm all for more bloodpoints for survivor, but you're probably going about this in the most dumbass way possible.
---
By the way, there's not a god damn thing in the post you responded to that wasn't 100% true. If you're having trouble recognizing that, maybe you should try learning what the fuck you're talking about.
---
Because to play killer requires you to level up every killer and beyond. For survivor, you just need to invest all your points into one survivor and your done. 
---
That’s a huge difference. I just sunk over 7 mil BPs into my Trapper just to make him playable.
---
&gt; It really is amazing how mother fucking dense people can be.
---
And posts like this prove it.
---
Oh I know about that, I was asking if they lessened the condition for the achievement from last year, because I got it when it first came out.
---
As for Uprising, yeah no you're fucked, that event was built around those 4 heroes in the state they were at the time, so the Mercy/Torb rework kind of put a big wrench in the works.
---
makes me glad I slaved for it when it came out #humblebrag
---
If you check the DG twitter and subreddit, there are quite a few people excited for the revamp. Every comment on DG’s twitter posts are nothing but love and support. Basically the complete opposite of DBD’s community.
---
Looking at you Jane 👀👀
---
👍🏼
---
Pretty sure he just knew that you had a bunch more pallets and windows in the temple and just deiced to find somebody else to chase.
---
Amazing art! &gt;!Please do porn!&lt;
---
The New Nightmare Freddy would be sweet.
---
I can understand why you'd want that but it really wouldn't help.
---
Especially if you're the last person on hook you're just going to have the killer just stand there until you eventually die to avoid you jumping off.
---
Even If by some miracle you got hooked by Hatch the killer could very easily just close it. it's not like before where if you jumped off when being close enough to the Hatch you safe
---
I do, my best buddy does and that's what really got me into it. But my parents know he has it so I'm afraid there going to talk to his parents
---
This happens a lot on ps4, but once one person leaves it seems like two immediately join.
---
Thats me and NOED. I get NOED like 12x in a row and am finally forced to buy it.
---
If he wasn't so obnoxious about using his "i've got *suuuper* secret info" deal to whore out likes and follows on Twitter I might have a little bit more sympathy.
---
As it stands, it's just disappointment. He'll live.
---
Thats my Doc and Unnerving. It's very sad lol.
---
Any of the corn maps are bs as killer. Damn corn eye gets me everytime, and it sure comes up a lot considering its random draw from 27 maps.
---
You did it dude, always believed  in you. Good work.

This reminds me when I was younger and wanted to play tf2 at my friends house and my parents talked with theirs

What this got me was losing my computer priveleges

Soo good luck hopefully this doesnt happen to you

Pig w/ Amanda's Letter: Am I a joke to you?

By this point I find it more cliche and overused than anything else. There's no better way to scream "i get all my jokes from reddit comments".

Possible
---
What pc do you play on where it isn't stable?
---
Guess crouching, running and throwing stuff is a supernatural ability now
---
This are my new favorite. Thank you for tagging me in the other post
---
RIP bro, thanks anyway have a nice one
---
Staying in range of your traps isn't camping. And if a hag has someone in a basement with a ton of traps, the survivor hooked down there is kinda screwed regardless. That's just playing your killer effectively.
---
Let me guess, doing a daily?
---
Oh god the entitlement
---
Oof I actually got this meme from Instagram
---
paulie esther is such a good, pure, and kind human being
---
No! God! No god please no. No! No! Noooo!
---
^^^
---
&gt; How would one play hag effectively without camping?
---
Your opponent was a dipshit who had more rage than brains. Don't let your competition tell you how you play the game.
---
“Chase me more! Ya come over here cunt, ya chase me, oooh dead hard get FUCKED”
---
postgame: ggwp
---
Honestly at this point noed is a waste of a perk slot. Every time I use it it almost always gets cleansed.
---
Thanks! I assumed the bp reward was for the survivor. I just was worried people thought i was trying to be an asshole when I was trying to show condolences for having three people dc...
---
All gens were done at this point.
---
I think I'm gonna add to this that since OP said they looked around the map, they only downed one person, and all their totems were destroyed, that I'm assuming this is late game where there's only 3-4 gens currently present on the map (aka 1-2 gens left to finish), therefore, not hard to quickly check up on them without straying too far. 
---
Wanting to secure a kill late game is fine, but if it's at the start of the match, go look for people instead.
---
Something that's helped me play him is put traps near hooks before you hook a survivor, then after you hook somebody place one near them in the opposite direction. Once their freed they'll likely run towards your first trap. I've gotten a fair amount of people this way.
---
For real tho do you have where this was said? Not that I doubt it as much as I want to
---
Messege to my killers: We're shouldn't get A 4K every single game.
---
This was after gates opened, one did find a flashlight.
---
And then there’s the Hag who slaps that bitch shut.
---
the original release date for persona 5 was winter 2014, its kinda become a joke in the persona community.
---
The image is from some hacking forum where they asked to remove the corn from the game files.
---
ah. I never saw that coming
---
Well...in my mind it doesnt make much sense to release a full chapter with the Freddy rework so close...but thats just me.
---
honestly i'm not trying to be a dick but when i first joined this sub reddit in 2017 compared to now it honestly feels like the sub has been invaded by 12 year olds or something....i just don't recognize it anymore, sadly you are right about noone giving a shit anymore about the lore and actual mature discussion. People who actually make the points you just made and that i agree with usually get downvoted into oblivion.
---
You know you can just find the hatch and close it right?
---
yea i gotta agree that no matter how much i can't stand the majority of memes we have now there use to be some actual originality and work put into the mememing on this sub
---
Dull Machete would be pretty OP.  Here’s a rework maybe?
---
Dull Machete:
---
Your death is so lame it is encouraging to other survivors.  If you die all survivors gain a confidence boost and repair, heal, cleanse, vault, and open gates 5/ 10 / 15% faster than normal.
---
Another version of it:
---
Golden Chainsaw:
---
You are destined to have an amazingly cool death.  When the gates are powered the killer can *kill you by their own hand* however you can be hooked an additional 0.5 (Struggle state with half the normal struggle state bonus)/ 1/2 times.
---
I'unno. Simplicity, I assume.  
---
I mean, who knows how many decimals there could be to the percentage values?
---
I consider 3-4k to be a win for a killer, 2 a tie, 1-0 win for survivers. But in this shit ranking system you can kill 4 and still not get a pip
---
Link? From what I know the original rights owner appealed the court decision just last month.
---
anytime someone tries to actually have mature discussion about anything on this sub or say anything that rubs the negative ones the wrong way they end up downvoted into oblivion, i am starting to understand why shitty memes can get hundreds or over a thousand likes where as someone trying to start up an actual discussion about the lore of the game or discuss design and gameplay mechanics will get dozens or more downvotes
---
Killer objective is to hook and kill survivors. Don't let anyone ever tell you how to play this game (including BHVR with their pip system). Play the best game you can, and if that involves "camping" or "tunneling" (both artificial terms invented by survivors to give them something other than their own mistakes to blame), so be it.
---
As killer, I go for targets of opportunity. If you unhook your teammate in front of me, IDGAF, if they're close enough for me to hit, I'm putting them back down on the ground. That isn't me tunneling - that's you unsafely unhooking.
---
If I have a strategic advantage by maintaining a close distance to a hooked victim without sacrificing in other areas (letting gens go uncontested), that isn't camping. That's you screwing up and getting downed in a bad place strategically, and me capitalizing on it.
---
Play to your strengths, and ignore any other invalid criticisms.
---
Funny, you think those things have a time limit.
---
gshh—shhh. shshhshhshhh. dont ask questions. just keep scrolling.
---
i will try that out thanks.
---
I agree. If they secured their only kill that's pretty much camping and it's just punishing  one person because of lack of ability on the killers part. Hag isnt hard even with 0 perks you can 4k.
---
Delet dis
---
And then survirvers mains cry about noed...
---
Sadly, that's just how Hag is, excels at camping and defending stuff, sucks at chases. There will always be games where you get steamrolled, either due to survivors being better or you get a shitty map like Torment Creek or Wretched Shop. Best advice is just play how you want, whether it's deemed toxic or not, just have fun.
---
G R A N D M A.    L A U R I E.
---
&gt;Use Billy with speed limiter and charge speed addons
---
&gt;Only perk used is NOED, only attack used is chainsaw
---
&gt;Only 2-down, 2-hook everyone well before the exit gates are powered.  
---
&gt;Kate furiously teabags at exit, cusses me out in endgame chat for using "crutch perks".
---
wat
---
Thank you!!
---
Wait, Nea was a delinquent, Legion are Delinquents...
---
Gang Fight!
---
We found the bastion user!
---
So this is how it ends, is it? Really, with all the .5 memes, there's been way more than 100.
---
It’s a pretty upsetting topic, I wanna make sure no one’s upset about no Survivor or Map too much.  We all should be rightfully upset, I put my piece of proof on this thread somewhere.
---
;(
---
I love that last one
---
That's pretty smart, props to you on that.  But I'm saving up for a new gaming PC and both will take too much time. I am allowed outside but thank you for the advice
---
I never really commented on your work, for obvious reasons, but I can happily say you're the example of what memes should be. Effort, hard work and putting your own spin on things rather than just relying on a Spongebob screencap with Impact font plastered on top pooped out in 30 seconds to the effect of "Killers/Survivors r bad, amirite guiz?!"
---
Pretty sure nurse and hag are the same
---
I'm still gonna get it because Ghostface is my baby in terms of slashers. But we cant blame em that's two expensive licenses one for a mask another for movie. We know they tried.
---
There isnt a solid logic. They can criticize something you do then you can logically explain it and instead of understanding they usually double down on being dumb.
---
Wait, since when can the hatch be closed?
---
Uh. So. Are you saying you *want* a hatch standoff? Cause that’s how you get hatch standoffs. Those are even more annoying.
---
When your chasing a surv and you realize they are going to sandbag someone.

Make it puff loudly and recite scripture.
---
Thief: the Metal Age was scary.
---
tbh a bedazzled flashlight would look great
---
Obviously if you were good you wouldn’t even need perks /s
---
The hatch still doesn’t open by itself until there is only one survivor left. If the killer closes it, a Key will still open it again.
---
You could say the blood web.... bled out?
---
15 percent faster vault speed to everyone is ridiculous.
---
My favorite is how almost everyone complains about NOED and calls it toxic, meanwhile every group of survivors has 4x Adrenaline...
---
tbf yeah it kind of is if you suicide on hook, maybe remove vault speed
---
Ok thats good to know then, I wish they would have shown that better because their videos did not show anything about it.
---
I once had a survivor message to tell me to stop hiding in lockers.  The lockers were to counter BBQ &amp; Chili.. WHICH THEY HAD.  Asshole.
---
I once escaped twice with Quentin. Once with the hatch and once without. Hours later I was playing Jake and the achievement popped midgame 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Dance with me, quick and quiet, and lithe combo works  for good jukes
---
*pulls out uno reverse card*
---
Doctor, nurse, and spirit look coolest dont @ me
---
From what we understand, Freddys rework is going to be a complete redesgin of his power from the ground up, not just a mechiances change. 
---
I know they both are being worked on, but its likely a licnesling thing. 
---
Like for Bill, its up to Vavle.
---
Hag 2
---
Fucking love scary movie
---
MCote is a really good dev who was even kind to OchiDO, one of the people who fuels the community’s dislike of the devs, after OchiDO donated bits to try and get unbanned on MCote’s Stream.  He deserves more credit than he gets.
---
I find using kindred has increased my chances of surviving quite a lot
---
Playing with a new character is tough, yes. 
---
This is why I save up BP ahead of time to powerlevel a new killer or survivor. If that’s not possible, honestly, save yourself the frustration and continue playing with your main until you’ve gotten enough BP to level the new character.
---
The devs said they still want the dream world to play a factor in Freddy’s Power.
---
That leads to utter silence and shame on their part.
---
No doubt I hate how much these devs get bashed. These people care about their game have since launch. They are trying their damn hardest to make their game successful and fun. So we need to cut them some slack. MCote seems like such a great guy
---
Honestly I’d rather my teammates hide in lockers rather than hide behind a rock
