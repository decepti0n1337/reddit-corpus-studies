It could be cross platform. We don’t know yet. 
---
Fortnite is. Or at least the save data is. Not sure as I don’t play it. 
---

---
There is no reason it could not be with deactivated servers (other than advantages of platforms: mouse&gt;controller&gt;touchscreen).
---
---
---
He def needs some kind of quality of life buff. It wouldn't even make him randomly OP to not traverse long distances to pick up and then pick spots to set Traps. Sure they immobilize Survivors, but they aren't guaranteed and you have to travel to get them depending when and if a Survivor gets trapped.  
---
Where as Hag starts with 10 Traps, teleports to them and has add-ons to drastically change their duration and effects, plus her's are infinite &amp; faster to set...Trapper with the right build and circumstance can dominate a game but those require rarer add-ons, right map and the pieces to fall into place perfectly.
---
I agree with everything except 2, 3, 9 and 4
---
I don't even used balanced and I dont think it's OP, I've gone against it it's just a slightly nerfed exhaustion perk with the benefit of no fall repercussion.
---
Clown and Plague are still semi ranged killers weaker on console.
---
Do we know thats how it works though?
---
*implies everyone playing the game is a casual and is bad at the game*
---
*gets mad at being called out for being bitter*
---
Yup, sounds about right
---
Mother fucker :(
---
i just fade away
---
Chad Dwights
---
Hes not a Real rank one dbd gamer like boolValues guys
---
They do don't they? If I remember correctly, a survivor will always get gold unbroken if they escape not matter how many time they were downed, and get iridescent if they didn't go down at all.
---
Bow chicka bow wow
---
sometimes Myers just needs someone to listen to him :(
---
Bruh. There are literal infimites using balanced landings. Coal tower, Haddonfield, etc..
---
I've had people DC when I played as Michael and Tier 3'd a Jane thru a window, had 3 DCS in 3 separate games as Trapper and 1 DC in my game as Doctor...people are just petty as fuck lmao
---
OR
---
You go for the save you take 1st hit, unhook, take 2nd hit and take his place while he gets away for the safe unhook. Boom Protection + Unhook 2 stacks package deal xD
---
You do one more and have 1 left to spare for... playing :P
---
What if it's like The Spirit &amp; once it recharges you can enter the "real" world for a limited duration of time?
---
Amanda Testborn of the House Young, First of Her Name, Queen of the Karlssons, the Urbanevasions, and the First Crouch Walkers, the rightful Queen of the Twelve Realms and Protector of the Jigsaw Boxes, Lady Paramount of Adorable Squeaks, Queen of the Nerve Gas House, Queen of Jumpscares, Khaleesi of the Great Unexpected Tiger Roars, the First Survivor, Escapee of Reverse Bear Traps, and Mother of Cruel Death Traps; long may she reign!
---
I dont think its shorter...but even so it would have been smarter to either hit someone else or drop him on the ground
---
I’ll stick to using Borrowed time and taking hits while he’s carrying someone occasionally lol
---
I didn't downvote you.
---
Freddy is powerful in the right hands. And as Freddy main maybe I shouldn’t be giving pointers on how to beat him But here goes.
---
1. Split up.
---
If you gather with other survivors Freddy can sleep multiple of you at once. The more people that are a sleep the more Freddy can catch people off guard for easy hits. 
---
2. Know your surroundings. 
---
You want to be able to reach an obstacle in less then 7seconds. Favour vault locations over pallets. With Freddy’s invisibility he can often confuse you into using a pallet at the wrong time or from the wrong side. So try to save pallets for when your already asleep and he’s chasing you. 
---
3. Run early.
---
Unless you are almost done a gen, run when you here the lullaby. Don’t wait till he is putting you to sleep. When you wait Freddy will usually get a quick first hit.
---
4. Run far. 
---
Don’t stick around the area where he put you to sleep. Do your best to run to the furthest border of the map. If he chases keep running. This is a bad situation for Freddy as it wastes his time. If he seemingly gives up start trying to wake up but remain aware. Avoid running toward gens unless you know no one is around them. Freddy will take the opportunity to sleep them and now he can track two survivors and pick the one that’s easiest to catch.
---
5. Never believe you are safe. 
---
Freddy is strongest when he is bouncing between different targets. You might thing you lost him but he can track you as long as you are outside his terror radius. A good Freddy is keeping tabs on everyone he has asleep and will know where you are and what you are doing. Even when you seem sure that he’s chasing someone else and you have time to wake up keep in mind he might be on his way to your location to catch you unaware. 
---
6. Seek high ground.
---
When waking up try to do so from a position in which you have good visibility and get keep an eye on the directions of approach. Hills usually provide this the best.
---
7. Keep moving.
---
After waking up, being saved/saving off the hook, or causing a noise notification, move away from this location as soon as possible. Especially in the case of being awoken by an ally or being saved/saving off the hook. Freddy will likely be headed for you as in these situations he knows there will be at least two survivors he can sleep.
---
8. Beware his reach.
---
Freddy’s reach is incredible. He can often hit you through a pallet or vault location easier then most of not all killers. Be aware of this and vault or throw a little early. If he is close fake a vault or throw to make him swing at the wrong location and buy yourself some more room.
---
9. Love the crows.
---
Freddy is invisible but crows will still react to him. This can tip you off to the direction he is approaching.
---
A survivor can still not pip and escape
---
Nah, would bring us back to horrible killer kiub
---
whats his bottom perk?
---
When you loop the killer through 5 gens.
---
Haddonfield isn't that bad, I main killer I never DC lmao
---
Yeah dying on the hook makes sense to me. You still get the points and the game still ends for you. Whereas a DC is just pointless late game which im referring to, cause in a lot of my games thats what it was. Someone would quit near or at the end of the game, they survived the longest, did the most things and probably got more points than me as a killer. Yet still just quit.
---
Only bad if half the survivors are hooked and you want to save them
---
Best to stop posting threads like this, too. It probably just contributes to the noise.
---
*Four.
---
I was taught to do this when the killer is away from me and it’s safe to come
---
good.
---
I'm glad someone else noticed this.
---
All hail queen amanda of the house young!
---
If you've got half a brain and know how to loop and the killer doesn't deliberately tunnel you down or camp, it's not hard to reach end game as survivor, I'd say I do 80% of the time, especially at high ranks where my teammates aren't all shit. Hell, even if the killer is tunneling and camping, if you've got good pallet/gen placement, the killer isn't going to kill you all, flat out. And that's the thing, see, adrenaline procs regardless of if you're injured or not, if you're hooked, it doesn't matter if you've got two team mates dead, or if no one's been hooked the entire match, if you did four gens or no gens, you still get the rewards of adrenaline. And how exactly is that deserved? Two kills, chasing a survivor, they're injured, other survivor completes the last gen
---
But NOED isn't deserved, it rewards the killer for doing badly, since it only activates if they haven't killed anyone the entire match. 
---
Right? No, they both are "win more" perks that activate regardless of how the individual player did. Well. Unless the four survivors divide the minute of cleansing all the totems among themselves, then the killer wasted a perk. Besides that your argument is flawed, and hinges entirely on the assumption that the killer did poorly while using ruin in one specific given scenario. 
---
Also, "If 4 survivors are hurt towards the end of the game, that means you can't catch anyone/down them". What? I'm actually curious to know how many hours you've been playing killer, because that's nonsense. I've been in more than a few games where everyone was on last/second hook by the time we got to the last gen, two guys suicide rush the hook and get the guy off as the last gen pops, healing all three and giving them enough distance to make it to the exit door/pallets. In those games, it's not because the killer was bad or anything, it's because we were experienced players and had good pallet/gen spawns.
---
Horror doesn’t mean scary, but this game is definitely scary to many people nevertheless. It’s undoubtedly a horror game.
---
Thanks for the contribution.
---
Plague
---
I always thought that she should move at 105% with 1 blink one a short cooldown and maybe a very short fatigue. She keeps her strong anti looping but loses the crazy map pressure she can put out?
---
lol i noticed this also, i like was Fuck they got me
---
[removed]
---
Pop Goes the Weasel.
---
Hmm...but I don't really want to run a new build just on the off chance I go against Freddy - is stealthing against him even possible?  Should I try different perks?
---
No. Cuz you didn't win right.
---
Maybe you should check your computer's connection to steam or your connection to DBD? Idk what to do for that problem.
---
That may be pop goes the weasel
---
"Stun them all."
---
are you on the Always Sunny street?
---
My list was in no way meant to be taken in any order of competitiveness. It was merely a game I could call out that others would definitely know about. I personally don't like BR's at all because of the RNG of drops.
---
I've always countered BL loops easily your gonna need to clarify I've seen survs use "infinites" and I always catch them quick.
---
Wait, what? I just went against an Ace today that DC'd on his second down named "I Miss 72hrs". Who was this three day old man?
---
The downside isn't even bad imo, it's only a few seconds and you are pretty slow when uncloaking anyway
---
Especially not Pig or Wraith given their sweeping M1 hitbox. Not as much Range but it's significantly wider
---
No lol I have been playing Minecraft more than DBD now since Minecraft is a timeless classic and DBD is buggy grind hungry mess.
---
Get good, it just takes time, rank 14’s aren’t even that great. They know how to loop but that’s about it. Exposing yourself to difficult situations makes you better, you just need to control your salt.
---
(Please forgive the terrible quality, I used Snapchat and it destroys the quality lmao)
---
I mean it does make sense if you notice it's a SWF that joins. If it's that time of day where all the casual people are asleep and all that's left is play till 4 am toxic SWFs than you bet ur ass I'm pulling out my iridescent items
---
Maybe I'm in the minority but getting shit on makes me a kinder player in general. Cause I know what it's like and I'm not about to subject some random person to it who had nothing to do with my last game.  That's a shit mentality.  Now, if they BM?  It's on and they're dead.  I don't care how toxic I have to play.
---
Yes that's what I mean. The gatekeeper emblem should work like that.
---
It's absolutely terrible. In fact, the win/loss metric needs to be completely decoupled from ranking. You can win and still play poorly, and you can lose but still do well with what you had. People shouldn't be required to do specific things that have nothing to do with the objective just to avoid being told they lost, despite finishing all their goals.
---
I've never seen 'I play both sides' be anything other than code for *"I mostly play ____, but I'm going to pretend I don't so that you think what I'm about to say is even-handed"*. Virtually everyone has more empathy for one side's issues than the other.
---
*cautiously unzips*
---
He also should not have to worry about stepping in his own traps
---
Yep, ridiculous.
---
Even worse when it's a megtard trying to open the gate. You're getting chased, but the meg only has to see the killer to get scared and run away. Whereas if she stayed on the fucking switch, it would be open and all would escape.
---
Normally it's fine but most of the time randoms open it as someone goes down or already is down and i usually try to 99 the door so i have enough time to try and save
---
Chicka wow wow!
---
Fair enough.  Rest of the point stands true though skill ceiling is insanely low in this game. You have to be genuinely not trying to win to be below rank 15
---
I want bloodpoints shhhhh. Also though it is kinda clutch as fuck bro
---
cream chalk pouch gang for life
---
Well just sold the hard copy for double what it was worth so. Yeah.
---
so true
---
Stay in denial man but ask any veteran and they will state the same. DBD is not an e-sport. Never will be simply because it is not meant to be taken competitively. Why? Because, again, the game literally doesn't have a big enough gap between the skill floor and ceiling. You can keep thinking you're a hot shot killer and that's fine if it makes you feel better. I'm just saying not to waste hundreds and thousands of hours into this game thinking you're actually going to get any better. You won't because of the skill ceiling that will prevent that.
---
&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, last message since I am getting the impression you're a high schooler based on your replies. They pretty much dumb down to "U mad bRo!?" You know, the typical high schooler rebuttals that aren't worth any adults time.

*That's* a concussion...
---
Oh look, another "this game isn't instantly easy, I'm deleting it" post.
---
Well he does it in the films all the time why not.
---
Don't give up. You will get better. Check out videos on youtube about how to run tiles, how to run shack and work on how to mind game others.
---
The game seems like a point and click but there's a respectable learning curve. 
---
Just don't give up - you can do it!
---
Hi, Nobody!

That’s a shame. Shoulda gave it more of a chance, especially with friends.

This looks like a good spot to find some ingredients
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
Do it yourself.
---
In keeping with their 'spread the punishment' philosophy of their last two killers, I'd bet on his power getting stronger the more survivors are tagged/attacked with it.
---
Lmao it takes more effort to hold the chainsaw then actually play the game half the time
---
🦀🦀🦀🦀 survivors are powerless to ruin 🦀🦀🦀🦀
---
Starts chanting "Fight!"
---
the main issue with that is they have to get official outfits from the movies/shows like with ash and i don't think they're allowed anything not in the movies/shows
---
EGC can be in progress. The gates just have to be powered.
---
People are way overreacting to what you're saying. You're being pretty humble considering what they're saying.
---
I have not received an invitation either. If they've already been sent out I guess tough luck to us then.
---
That still doesn't really answer the question. Yes, bad players tend to use noed, but that's not relevant. It's also not relevant that you would probably kill the last guy after you've killed the first three regardless, that was just a hypothetical situation I was using to illustrate my point that noed helps you regardless of how well you played, just because it also helps poor killers doesn't mean it rewards you for doing poorly, in the most literal sense, it rewards you for not having all of your totems cleansed. Just imagine I said two survivors left standing. There's also an argument to be made against killers who use the spirit fury/enduring combo, since it basically gives you a free hit every third pallet so long as you're not using a potato as a mouse.
---
...Okay, that's legitimately bothersome lol
---
Not really a shame. At least now I can buy some pizza and beer.
---
yea if you get a 4k from slugging, face camping , noed, thats a no from me.
---
Awesome, glad you got it from the shrine! If you do decide to get Hag, I recommend looking up a Hag guide by Space Coconut on YouTube and also just play around with how it works in matches. Good luck!
---
Cool story. Did your mom teach you that one.
---
As the killer my job is to kill you, I’m not throwing a fucking birthday party where all the kiddies have a good time, I hate the tern tunnelling, some times you have to do it.
---
Report the killer on Steam, report them in post-game lobby, and file a support ticket to report them on the official website. That's every way you can report them. Tunneling isn't a bannable offense, but racism is.
---
why the fuck run those perks together tho?
---
Exactly. It’s unfortunate but now I know haha.
---
Just once, I'd love to see a team of survivors run around and 99% each gen instead of popping the one they're on, out of concern that the killer is getting rushed out of the match and they're not having fun. The double standard is weird. There's no difference in how you were rushed out of a match, kills or gens, if it lasted five minutes anyway.
---
Probably gonna put survivors in the dream state and make them be exposed, devs get their dicks wet to the exposed status lol
---
I sold the game already. Too late for that but thanks anytmway
---
I'm a Leatherface main, I am only hostile about Insidious Camping because I know that is what people do. P3 Claudette is also often stereotyped as the toxic people
---
You can’t pickup survs that are awake. 
---
I was playing last week and I had 3 games where someon1 missed a check on a slug and ran off left them there and I couldn’t pick them up
---
They announced a full year more or killers, Ghostface being the first of that next month.
---
So they're still doing 3 more chapters.
---
After that, I would be ok if it was over.  It had a good run but yeah it can't last forever
---
Lemme guess, he didn’t know how Freddy works?
---
I love everything this represents lol
---
On high ranks yes
---
When you can have matches where the killer chases you the entire match and you escape, it should not punish you because you did not get gens. In a match where you kill the survivors so fast they get no gens done and you finish the game in 5 chases and 5 hooks you should not get punished because you didn't stall out.
---
The whole concept is flawed and frankly it kinda just homogenizes survivor perks even more, since you cant run a dedicated Gen jockey,altruism or chaser build. It means everyone is sorta just gonna run your exhaustion perk for chases, your Self care and so on, you can make a dedicated build anymore because regardless of anything you still gotta fix a few gens, unhook a few people, get chases a few times.
---
I haven't done this because of a shitty previous match, but I have been pissed at 'real life' things and played with an Ebony Mori to take my anger out on some game characters.

---
This guy gets it.
---
Nah, my mom taught me not to be a little bitch if something is difficult. You'll get there some day.
---
Exactly. It's also illogical for survivor players to expect to benefit from each other's productivity and clutch plays, but refuse to accept consequences for their bad ones. Tunneling/kill rushing is mostly a survivor behavior problem if the killer isn't camping, specifically with bad rescues.
---
Cause getting every perk tier 3 on a single survivor or killer dosen't take needlessly long, sure. I don't want extra bloodpoints, i want bloodwebs to be less luck based. My p3 Nea still dosent hace dead hard tier one, it's bs that i have to spend thousands of bloodpoints just so HOPEFULLY, i can get something I want.
---
I never get the nonsense of people complaining a 0K turning into a 4K with NOED. At most the killer can reasonably get a 2K at most unless the survivors legit play stupid. If someone goes down to NOED and the other 3 survivors are at an open exit gate then you're always free to leave instead of complaining the killer gets an undeserved 4K when you give to them by being suicidal and not cleansing totems.
---
3 reasons: 1 - They're waiting for the killer to come so they can accumulate more points. 2 - They want to make sure everyone escapes safely. 3 - They just want to taunt the killer.
---
Yeah with the healing nerfs and Sloppy becoming meta it's more efficient to power through the gens and get the insta heal.
---
Well she did raise a winy little bitch tho...
---
It had nothing to do with anything. Killers try to stop you from cleansing. Sneaky killers are sneaky. Are you going to tell us water is wet or grass is green next?
---
Im just stating facts.
---
I play Leatherface. Roast me
---
Sold it 15 minutes after making this post for "double" what it's worth?
---
Enjoy that silver platter.
---
The same subreddit that believes that there's no such thing as 'gen-rushing' because it's literally the survivor's only objective will shame killers for rushing their only objective.
---
Right, because this is *my* post... 😐. Take care little fella.
---
More like some turbo virgin who plays to much dead by daylight but sure
---
I’ll take “Things That Never Happened” for $500, Alex.
---
Hooo boy look at these edgelords using such naughty words.
---
Sounds like this guy is keen on getting banned for DC'ing a bunch.
---
Ok, what you said makes sense, but what if a rank 20 killer gets 5 gens done and 0 hooks, and ends up getting a 4K because they played bad. Maybe I’m wording it incorrectly, idk. 
---
And for the totem thing, there’s no totem counter, so again. It will reward bad killers for doing their job poorly, or should I say, punishes the first survivor to get hit after doing all the gens and all subsequent survivors if the totem gets a damn good spawn, yea that’s it. If you as a killer cannot defend and kill before all the gens pop, you did poorly, if you get a reward for not defending gens, that’s a reward. If you het NOED for failing to guard generators, you are getting rewarded for playing bad. And thats ok, because swf exists and some killers and survivors have rough games. But it’s still a speed boost and 1 hit for failing to do the objective.
---
So to be simple. NOED CAN and WILL reward bad killers that can defend the gens, and it will HELP decent killers who have a few more kills to get when The generators are done, yes?
---
But that’s the thing. It’s still only tells you it activates when the gates are powered, so if it’s a persistent killer, and your teammates haven’t opened a door near you, and the killer has NOED, you are guaranteed to die, unless your teammates find the now lit totem and cleanse.
---
You too. Baby.
---
So why are you complaining if the Survivors aren't healing? If they're all injured it's in the Killers favor.
---
It happened.
---
If this happened it would just reward more killers who play scummy.
---
And I don't deny that. But I would like to see them fix the things they are already charging us for before moving on to new things. Think the idea behind operation health in R6.
---
they are attempting to 360, in which the force the killer to miss their hit while disorienting them
---
It didn’t.
---
Hit it right on the head. Like holy accuracy
---
I still haven't faced the plague yet. Guess I should be happy about that. Facecampers suck the most
---
You clearly don't know this community xD
---
You do know this thread is about Adrenaline, right?
---
Very true, but R6 is still plagued with bugs. Most of the issues in DBD rn are because of hitboxes, ping and raking system. Personally I don’t experience many bugs or graphical glitches.
---
Lmfao at least I can tell the difference between wanting some competition in my games instead of the opposing force rolling over and wanting a game to be an esport.
---
But I guess distinctions like those are below your galaxy brain
---
Remember that this is the 2010 Freddy, not OG Freddy. 
---
Also, having to wait for the survivors to fall asleep would never fly in DBD. The survivors would literally never fall asleep on their own during a match, they'd just do all the gens and then get out.
---
I mean facing a Freddy with remember me or someone with dying light you’d literally get tunneled off the bat and they would know instantly so, bad idea.
---
It did buddy
---
Can't wait for Ghostface in the BTAS style. I really like these Because they  have effort put into it.
---
Freddy shouldn't be visible period until the survivor is completely asleep.
---
every lunge for every killer has the same hitbox and lungespeed/distance. except for t3 myers and i think post blink nurse
---
It's not possible if the Freddy knows what he's doing. And if you don't want to run counters, is it really viable to complain about him? Yeah, I'd try different perks.
---
I belive gen rushing exists, but in in the terms that you think. To me Gen rushing is when the killer fails to get pressure and control on survivors fast enough to stop them from getting done too fast.
---
Lmaoo
---
I know that myself, and a number of other people online have been completely unable to play full matches due to a game breaking bug that simply causes you to disconnect regardless of internet connection. Its ruining the game for me personally and its frustrating to see them focus on battle-passes and cosmetics while many people are unable to play the game they paid for.
---
2, 7 i couldn't agree more
---
I wonder this as well it seems to only work on inexperienced killers so why try at high ranks?
---
Do u play on console?
---
HEY CINDY!
---
Survivors camping at exit means they've already won; unless some shenanigans happen.
---
Killers camping survivors on hook is a bit of a dick move because it then becomes super difficult to extract the hooked player safely and all but means the game is over for that player. Not really fun is it?
---
Ufufufu - cries in Doctor
---
OH, okay I never put that together. Thank you!!
---
It's photoshopped this is what he actually looks like
---
https://i.imgur.com/13QK1Bk.jpg
---
no, im saying that getting a double pip once at a low rank doesnt mean anything
---
I hang around to see if anyone gets downed or hooked and needs helped. I leave immediately if the Killer comes to the exit gate.
---

PC, it started around 2.6
---
I wanna get &gt;!married-i-mean-!&lt;moried by a shirtless myers.
---
I didn't play much of the game, but my impression of raincoat was that while brutal in terms of catching/securing his victims, he was mehodical in execution and disposal. Maybe something centered around that aspect of the character?
---
Power could be focused on the rain, meaning the killer has the ability to alter landscape or create small areas where they're buffed/able to control more easily?
---
another potential could be a tracking/awareness power, something cerebral where he loses tracking through traditional DBD means but the power can compensate/boost other means.
---
Some killers I really don't mind, but I just dealt with NOED Nurse lol.
---
Thats actually a really cool idea!

so was i

6 totems I thought?
---
Yet you stated healing is mandatory.
---
Nurse isnt as good on console. On pc shes unstoppable. Literally. The pros literally never miss a blink.
---
I'm not complaining, I'm asking for advice.  Also, it's not that I "don't want to run counters" but rather I don't want to make a Freddy-specific build considering I don't see him that often.
---

Right? Why expect random to be coordinated? And If you're playing with randoms, then you're their random.
---
Remind me in issues at tunneling is something that is thrown around way too frequently.
---
Let's Begin
---
If run right into the killer right after being unhooked and you get down that is not tunneling.
---
If for some reason you decide to stay around the hook after being on hooked when the person who saved you runs so you're the only person that the killer sees you can't really call tunneling.
---
This is just for people who go up against Amanda stop running like headless chickens when you have a reverse bear trap on it does not grant you immunity from being chased. If I'm not doing anything at the moment and I see you running around her a reverse bear trap I'm going to go after you.
---
So then we're not on a different thread then. Also you failed to answer my question about you complaining that Survivors are refusing to heal. How's that an issue?
---
5/7/9 with 60 sec cooldown is more reasonable. But an interesting perk idea nonetheless.

Good to know thanks

Play a better game where this isnt a thing maybe?

Happy cake day!
---
to me playing as a survivor it's the most fun if a killer is doing their absolute best to kill me, not be "the friendly XD let u go :)" killer
---
everyone has a different idea of fun, but it's silly to expect people to try less hard to win and pretend it's "ignoring the other side's fun" to play your best
---
I’m on mobile so bear with me, also I’m not being shouty, I’d genuinely like to go over a lot of what you said...
---
“&gt;” It is though. The ranking system is bad because it doesn't reward you for doing things that indicate skill. 
---
Ok for the record I also think the ranking system is shot, but this just doesn’t make sense.  I understand the objective in a “lore” sense is to survive and kill, but it’s not the objective of this game as displayed by the ranking system.  If surviving was the objective, survivors would get pips for just surviving and they don’t.  The ranking system is quite clear in what you need to do in order to rank up, and surviving is but a fraction of it, this isn’t really something that’s debatable.  To pip as both killer and survivor you need to have a pretty damn good round, filled with doing plenty of things that require skill.  On the survivor side knowing how to make a chase last is skillful, as a killer being able to mindgame efficiently is skillful.
---
“&gt;” The killer getting a 4k indicates he is vastly better than the survivor side, and displayed skill. The survivor escaping may have displayed skill, but may not have, so it probably shouldn't be weighed as heavily.
---
Again, I feel like you didn’t understand the point of my original comment, I was being sarcastic.  I think giving survivors a pip just for surviving would be stupid, the reason I think that’s stupid is because it’s the equivalent of a killer putting down 4 brain dead survivors.  You think survivors who did shit all game shouldn’t be rewarded?  So do I.  But you think killers who beat miserable opponents should receive the absolute maximum amount of xp?  That just doesn’t line up with me.  A 4K does not automatically mean the killer was skillful, it is however an indication that the survivors were definitely less skilled than the killer.
---
“&gt;” You cannot treat things as equivalent in an asymetric game, that is the point of it being asymmetric. You surviving as a survivor is not a 1:1 inverse of the killer getting a 4 kill, and the rank system should not treat it as such.
---
I would like to state this again, because you seem to think I was saying the opposite of what I was saying in my original comment, maybe it’s a testament to my sarcasm, but I wasn’t being serious.  I’m more than aware 1 person surviving is not the same as a 4 kill, kinda weird that you thought that’s what I was saying to be honest. 
---
“&gt;” You do in literally every other game that uses a ranking system.
---
This is hyperbole, and not true
---
“&gt;” Ranking systems are not a method of rewarding players for doing wacky things to style on their opponents.
---
We can both agree that the ranking system is broken, let’s get that clear.  But you can get points in all categories without doing anything whacky.  Forcefully revealing yourself to a killer in order to lead them on a chase can be a skillful tactic, it’s far from whacky.  And as a killer with the right build and gameplay you can get all iris and double pip without doing anything whacky.  I watch a lot of highly skilled DBD players and the whacky stuff is but a small part of the game, and even the players who pull them off will tell you themselves that shit 9/10 times doesn’t go their way.  Yes this ranking system will reward players for doing whacky stuff, but it’s possible to get those same exact points through other methods.
---
“&gt;” DBD's does, because it depends so heavily on interaction that everyone could play a perfect game (Killer gets a 4k, efficiently wins chases after a normal chase length, but doesn't stop the gates opening due to time. Survivors can't get hook rescues, but everyone does their gen share and has a decently long chase) and no one pips.
---
 
---
This is your description of “everyone playing a perfect game?”   A perfect game would be everything you said PLUS 3 hooks per survivor with all the saves, and would result in pips for everyone, provided the survivors distributed the gen work and saves/heals evenly.  Why is your definition of a “perfect game” have all the survivors getting 1 hooked and no one saving anyone else?  That’s extremely strange to me.  Sounds like you described what should be a perfect game for a Killer, but not “everyone.”
---
“&gt;” The current system (...) is still not really good at identifying how well you did because its full of perverse incentives that reward you rank for doing very unhelpful, unproductive things purely for the sake of earning rank. A good ranking system does not include elements of 'shooting the moon' and should be unobtrusive, this is basic game design. If players are sabotaging their own play to game your rank system, your rank system is bad.
---
This is more hyperbole if you ask me.  As a survivor you need to do objectives, do saves, run from the killer, and survive.  The ranking system is bad, but I was totally unaware that doing what you’re supposed to do is “perverse and unproductive”.  I think the fact that survivors HAVE to interact with the killer or they get punished is a little weird and could use some tweaking, and resembles a little bit of what you’re getting at, but you’re acting like you need to do things completely unrelated to the core gameplay in order to rank up and that is just blatantly untrue.  I rank up just fine playing the game how it’s supposed to be played, I’m not “gaming” anything. 
---
“&gt;” How does hiding 3 feet away from the killer from behind for 15 seconds constantly and then running away any time they pick someone up and carry them to hook display skill? It doesn't, but weirdly it is way more efficient points wise than unhooking. Repairing a full gen gives you almost nothing towards lightbringer, but unhooking, bodyblocking, and the person going down nearly instantly after the farm window is gone is a full rank. It is bonkers what emblems reward, because they don't actually reward good play at all. They reward the survivors doing stupid shit just to get emblem points.
---
As a survivor if you can consistently stay behind the killer the whole round and run away every time he downs someone else without dying themself, (you know that thing that we all see every survivor do in every game we play... more sarcasm), I’ve got bad news for you dude, that is 1 of 2 things:  a great survivor, or a terrible killer.  If that survivor is doing this and not getting downed by the killer, how the hell are you gonna say that doesn’t display skill?  A survivor can run up to a killer sniff his ass and run away without getting downed and you think that doesn’t display skill?  I’m not even debating you on what should and shouldn’t yield points bc we actually agree there, as I’ve said the ranking system is def broken.  But this odd fake scenario you have here, it’s something that is not happening most of the time, and if it is happening there is without a doubt skill on the survivor’s side.  No idea how you wouldn’t think that.  It’s possible to get all iris as a survivor without doing any “stupid shit”, I’ve never felt forced to do anything stupid and I’ve gotten plenty of double pips just from how a round naturally played out. 
---
“&gt;” And, to be clear, I think it IS worse for the survivors, as they are forced to preform killer interactions to farm points. The killer controls tempo and wants interactions anyway, so their weird incentive stuff at least is stuff that often happens naturally and it is more the emblem system just falls apart vs high rank survivors, but good survivors get punished super hard by emblems at all ranks.
---
This section I think I completely agree with.  Ranks 1-4 are clearly a nightmare for killers going up against optimized survivors and for survivors now the problem is even getting there in the first place.  I had been to rank 1 several times before the change and admittedly I haven’t made it back since.  It was clearly too easy to rank prior and I’m in support of making ranking up more meaningful, so I also agree that this system is the best system we’ve gotten yet, which gives me hope that it can be fixed. 
---
tl;dr - thanks for discussing DBD with me

wh- what the fu-
---
I only do it for the bp it isnt fun to play this way
---
Wat.
---
While I do understand your points and can kinda agree I think you need to consider the fact that healing is not something that survivors should be expected to do anymore as we are currently in a meta where healing without running a build designed to do so is utter garbage. SB is meta on a large majority of killers and self care just isn’t viable anymore (largely due to SB being meta), this makes it so the only time healing is worthwhile is when another survivor is healing you which often is a waste of time because of how quickly either side can gain momentum in the current state of the game. Even 16 seconds can be enough time to detriment your team on a level far too severe to waste.

*Gets instadowned by Billy*
---
Honestly, I think you're just making all that up. There's no way you could know if all or most killers face camp because of some perceived slight.
---
Honestly I question whether or not it’s possible for people to not show some amount of bias towards one side, it’s simply our nature.
---
*killers with endgame builds intensify*
---
You’re working for the entity if that’s your escape plan
---
It has nothing to do with 'I'm friendly, join me in skipping through the fields of BP :D'.
---
It has everything to do with recognizing when you dominate so hard in a one-sided match that you should reel back the difficulty on your opponents, and offer yourself up a challenge through other fun means, such as:
---
- Recognize when you're tunneling and break off from that person.
---
- Occasionally avoid returning to the person being unhooked, or ignore a saviour going for the unhook, and instead run around the map kicking gens so they can recover a bit while you regain full map awareness.
---
- Game's been going on a while but your gen defense has been super on point? Perhaps stop kicking gens for a little bit - allow them to keep some of that progress in that manner only
---
- take the opportunity to try other tricky tactics or maneuvers involving your killer powers or unique perk selection.
---
There's plenty of ways to have more fun in this game that don't involve complete annihilation and angering your opponent(s) and you'll eventually find fun playstyles and perk/addon combos in doing that too.  Additionally, if you play like this regularly: it makes it all the more great when you come up against a crew that teabags, pops generators in your face, shows no fear, or is otherwise really ready for a challenge.
---
Hey that's awesome.
---
I'm a new game designer and want to learn more!
---
Where is my StalkyFace boi? :(
---
I agree you can mindgame her, but against the best of the best nurse players this just works once. Because then instead of predicting stuff, they just blink into a close range from which the next blink doesn't have to be a long prediction, just a short one to catch up and hit you. I also agree that tweaking some of the other stuff would be nice. But after all, I'm more about buffing other killers rather than just nerfing good ones. BHVR could even do something like they do in most games, just randomly buff stuff and nerf other so the meta is shaken a bit. Killers and perks (surv and Killer's) of course.

If you ever want to completely destroy somebody's build bring Diversion. I'm telling ya I chucked it at a Killers head before and they forgot which role they were playing so they helped us repair all the gens.

OOF. At least you probably had a quick and easy match. I had the most unbearable match with a freddy that had NOED and ruin on the spirits map, made me want to jump off a building.
---
JFC it's a real sub
---
How...is that even possible? I had a match as Wraith where I just fucked around, didn’t bother with gens or hitting survivors, and I still got about 1k bp.
---
Nurse should be higher, her voice when she enters fatigue is so cute and eerily still human
---
That's like saying "you can't tell me that all pedophiles like children". Obviously the comparison isn't as severe, killers who face camp aren't on Par with child molesters. But if it's for some tactical advantage, ur either rank 20 or really angry at someone if ur face camping them. We all know camping isn't a viable strategy bc you can't apply pressure to other gens if ur busy camping a hook. You only ever camp someone if you really want THAT person to die. Especially if ur playing a killer who isn't good at camping (Freddy, Any killer that can't mask their TR) and you only ever want THAT person to die of they did something to make you want their head on a platter more than others.
---
I would love that.  That's what you should be doing with Freddy right now lol

As a Nurse, Freddy, and Spirit player (in that order), I can confirm; porn is very suspect.

Wait wasnt there a part about this in his movies?
---
My point is that you can't say his power is gonna be worse from 1 screenshot. You might be fine with how he works now, but a large amount of people don't enjoy it. Survivors too, it's boring af to sit around waiting for a skillcheck. It's also not fun watching a gem get popped in your face because you have to wait 7 seconds to literally touch a survivor. You can play Freddy and get kills and do well, but his ability right now is pretty lame. So how about you wait and see what's actually different before getting bent out of shape. The last few reworks and tweaks have been pretty good (legion, PTB spirit, and piggy) so have a little faith

How is spirit s tier? She sounds like a mix between waluigi and a villager from minecraft when she gets stunned

That's a seriously flawed analogy. You're basically saying all killers who face camp do it out of spite (a personal opinion) by virtue of them face camping, and compare that to pedophiles, who are attracted to children by virtue of being pedophiles (a fact).
---
You can't pretend an opinion is the same as a fact. 
---
1. Tunneling isn't a viable strategy, but it's a strategy. 
---
2. If the killer wants someone to die first, that doesn't necessarily mean that the killer believes the survivor did something to spite them.

---
They can ban for threats, extremely derogatory comments... basically what these "people" said to you got him super heated!
---
I haven’t read the rest of this thread because I can not be fucked but I personally do agree that escaping as the survivor should be minimum one pip, I think for either side 1 pip should be getting the job done (escaping/killing) and two pips should be for doing it well (doing gens, saving, running the killer/getting a 4K, ending the game quickly, ending chases fast etc)
---
What a douche u ruin people's experience for a game that u don't even intend playing very long

I don't think the invites have even been sent out yet. Otherwise we'd have seen posts about it. And nobody else has said anything in this or other threads like this. I'd still remain hopeful.

Yeah thats a factor as well, but I personally think the insta heal is worse.
---
&gt;If the killer wants someone to die first, that doesn't necessarily mean that the killer believes the survivor did something to spite them.
---
It's not if they want someone to die first. Its if they don't care what happens to the other 3, they want THAT Survivior to die. They don't care about the other 3 and they don't care if you die first, they want THAT Survivior to die no matter what, to the point that they're willing to ignore other Surviviors in order to do it. 
---
&gt;Tunneling isn't a viable strategy, but it's a strategy
---
I agree, but why tunnel if it isn't viable?
---
&gt;You're basically saying all killers who face camp do it out of spite (a personal opinion) by virtue of them face camping, and compare that to pedophiles, who are attracted to children by virtue of being pedophiles (a fact).
---
Killers who face camp don't do it bc it's a viable strategy. It's nothing more than just a way to tell someone "you didn't play the game the way I wanted you to, so now you'll pay for it". You're equivocating by not addressing what I'm saying. What else is face camping supposed to do? It won't secure you any kills outside of the one on the hook. And it won't stop the other 3 from doing Gens. 
---
And I compared them to pedophiles bc their actions are fucked up and they chose to do it. They could have (in the killers case) not taken out their frustration on people who just wanted to play the game and dared to not play it the way he wanted them to. Just like a pedophile can get psychological help for their problem. And I said that this comparison was extreme bc I knew you'd get hung up on this. I'm not saying killer mains are just as bad as Pedos so chill the hell out.
---
me, trying to 360
---
Maybe we should wait and see the actual reveal instead of trying to make assumptions based on ONE frame.
---
This is literally me when my teammate's trying to get their RBT off lol!
---
Please stop, get better internet or quit the game.  It’s literally no fun for survivors to just lag and rubber-band and have literally 0 chance to survive like that
---
Maybe people are complaining because, unlike you and many other people, we don't enjoy grinding and it is NOT our reason for playing games. We play games because derive enjoyment out of **playing** the game, not from grinding out mandatory shit to have at chance at altering our experience.
---
Literally survivor shroud offerings are worthless because usually all survivors just spawn right next to each other anyway lol
---
I'd have thought it'd be obvious by now. Adrenaline heals survivors, completely negating the task of healing (instantly, might I add). Not to mention that it gives a free sprint boost *and* free wake up versus Freddy.

You don't know shit so stop even trying to assume how he is going to be.

---
IMO they were also worthless before. The best strategy is to have all 4 survivors on different gens to pressure the killer. Working on the same gen decrease overall gen speed, not to mention if the killer has ruin, working on the same gen slows things done much more given how many people can't hit greats.
---
Seeing that power bar fills me with dread that this is not going to be good.  I'm glad to see the Dream World icon and, well, world, but there's no guarantee that it'll keep any of it's current stall or tracking potential.  Indeed, with the other shot that shows Freddy in the waking world, he may very well also be losing his Transition Mindgames.
---
I wish they revealed his gameplay today, though I'm sure it'd just have confirmed my worst fears I'd at least be able to start learning another killer without my thoughts drifting back onto the Nightmare.
---
If survivors only work on generators and none of the other categories they get punished too.
---
Its a casual game that people want to try hard at
---
They need to put a cap of how low your internet can be before you can play as a killer. This is common sense the fact that they let you farm survivors shows how little they care about fairness
---
Now I'm gonna hear this part of the song every time I see NOED pop up on my screen.
---
Then I am gonna dance my ass out of the trial just like that.

You don’t have to it gives you the name on the game screen with the obsession marking

Please no. We’re gonna farm forever already encourages unsafe rescues buffing it would make surviving with randoms even worse
---
Toxic meta
---
Word. Honestly shrouds of binding should be killer offerings and shrouds of separation should be survivor offerings
---
Play with your food. Not let them win
---
Agreed. I feel it's ridiculous that Trapper not only needs to set up his traps but just wander around trying to find them. And if he can only carry one at a time? Oooph, even worse. Just give him all his traps already and change the old addons to just add on top of his current number, or, I dunno, make the traps bigger or something.
---
Totally agree lol
---
never seen any game “put a cap on how low your internet can be” and even then it would create so much drama.  Please just give up killer
---
0 blink nurse but she becomes a 120% killer.
---
Uhhh you don't get stacks for unsafe rescues anymore.

I have no idea, me and my friends didn’t see him once, we just heard his chainsaw one time.
---
Did not end well for King’s Landing though :/
---
Tbh I was being sarcastic to demonstrate how I don’t agree that every 4 kill should be a double pip, but I will say that the ranking systems is absolutely fucked for both killer and survivor as it currently stands.  I think if escaping was an automatic pip then they would just have to make the depips even harsher.  Imagine the disparity in skill level amongst rank 1 survivors if all it took was getting out of an exit gate to pip.
---
Yikes that’s the worst, I’ve had games similar with Freddy on that map, two games in a row.
---
I am well aware of the rework. It still encourages unsafe hook rescues in the sense that they will unhook you when the killer is proximity camping and can easily come back to the hook to tunnel after the save
---
I give you 100% that there is no possibility of you getting banned for MLGA. If you are doubtful, contact EAC and you will get the same answer.
---
If someone is just honestly bad and they're gonna be dead on hook. Just slug em and preoccupy one of their teammates with helping him.
---
The more teammates that need help the less generators get done.
---
His responses scream troll
---
I see the clown being into those tipsyen/drugged videos. All the rest I agree with 100%
---
They just need to make it so that if people such as yourself have shitty internet then you shouldn’t be allowed to play killer
---
It's hard to tell due to this low quality screenshot but in the actual video there's the distinguishing shape of one of GF's wavy cloth things
---
WAAAAH
---
then the Meghead trying to "save" you from the killer picking you up, gets hit, instantly drops the pallet, then Sprint Bursts away.
---
i do care about others, i'm just not going to handicap myself because someone's having a bad game?
---
it's not lacking imagination to not "XD UWU fwiendly killer" when they're bad, we're at the same rank for a reason lol. I just don't enjoy being the "XD UWU fwiendly killer :3" - i'll do it of course if some loser DCs because the game isn't fun whether I go hard or not in a 3v1, so I'd rather make people happy if none of us are going to have fun anyway.
---
It's not about me. I already play that way. I'm reasonable. I also play survivor though. When I do no one plays that way. Every killer just rushes the kills if they can. It's the nature of the game for both sides.
---
They also banned it from a tournament.
---
They should make the gates slowly relapse, not quick enough where you can't juggle a killer back and forth between them but slow enough where you can't hit 99%ish and run off. 
---
After not being touched for a few seconds have it decay slowly.
---
The entity lives in fear of the Chalk Pouch Gang

That's a decent argument. But, I will say because of the rng elements in the game, you can have matches where 4-5 gens spawn very close together, making patrolling very easy, or you could have every gen spawn incredibly far away from each other, making it near impossible to defend gens and down survivors quick enough to keep pressure. which is basically why a lot of high level players main spirit nurse and billy, they might get 4ks with every killer, but those killers are the ones that can consistently deal map pressure. i digress. Obviously there are bad killers in this game, I'm not trying to argue that "oh it's always the maps fault" 
---
From the perspective that the killer's role is to protect gens first and kill second, barring rng bullshit the argument definitely makes sense, but if you're looking at it from the other angle, then the killer is rewarded for the survivors having a chance to escape the trial.
---
Then they can miss out on easy points lol
---
I dunno, they're already adding a killer with an instadown. I think would could be alright is a normal hit that you cant see coming till he's already lunging.
---
I've noticed this as well.
---
Spirit looks happy. Nice. Very rare.
---
We all know why. 😏
---
Wow a tier list where plague is actually on
---
Nice.
---
Easy for someone to mistake confidence for "god complex" and legitimate opinions for whining, especially when you have a clear bias against them.
---
I think YOURE cringe
---
I play like you aswell, I dont try hard just play for fun, 4 stack on my BBQ and chilli and im happy
---
Thank you 😘
---
F
---
They miss out and I get pummelled lol.
---
Truly, B-team’s finest work
---
I mean, I haven't been innocent of complaining. But with a game that us literally impossible to be balanced, they are having a 3 year anniversary. They deserve to celebrate. They worked their asses off to keep this game relevant.
---
I still think we should get a hide and seek mode lmao. Fuck doing gens. Just put a timer on the match and let people run and hide. After time’s up gates are opened/powered. I’m sure there’s more to it they can come up with, but just something fast, simple and fun. 
---
Somehow they could probably come up with a capture the flag style mode too. Like how we had to carry the lanterns around but instead give us bases to take them too. 2 teams, all survivors or even killers(once again whatever works best for them). 
---
Just some other short, fun game modes for when people get tired of the same old.
---
How do u get to rank 20 fast? Like DC or just play shitty till you get there?
---
I'm not telling you to go 'uwu friend here'.  You seem REALLY stuck on making that a point when that assertion hasn't been made at all, anywhere.  Lose that idea from your head.
---
I give people who've put up a good fight, the chance to give up when they've had enough ass whooping and that typically only happens after I've beat the tar out of all of them in a round.  If they don't take it, I hook and kill.  I'd say 4 out of 5 players don't give up at all.  The ones that do, I let them polish off the last gen or get the gate so that I can have a challenge on the last ones doing the mad dash for a win.
---
Getting creative with ways to creating challenges for yourself in places where there isn't much, is how I'm measuring your imagination. 
---
Also about the "same rank for a reason lol" -- are we playing the same game? because I'm seeing rank 5 killers vs rank 11 and 14 survivors on the regular.
---
Fucking top tier meme my guy. Top tier meme about my low-mid tier boi. IDC what most lists say, Bubby is best boy
---
Or everyone could just mind their own business and stop trying to regulate things........
---
Xbox
---
They are going to leave if they want. You arent the killers daddy. Only Myers is daddy
---
What in the actual f is this thread
---
"Some random asshole was being shitty to me so now I get to be shitty to some other random person." is like a running theme in the comments in this sub.
---
And that, kids, is how the wheel of toxic behavior spins on and on and on.
---
Ash being in the game and being so unique got a lot of new players to come to DBD, so I'm not complaining
---
Doc is obviously S tier, here
---
Because he's Ash.
---
Whenever two of my teammates inevitably disco on Gideon's, and it's me and one other person stuck trying to complete four gens, I immediately start duckwalking everywhere I go and staring stupidly up at the killer. Luckily I usually play as Dwight, which tends to inspire pity...
---
Not really, giving the middle finger is what 11 year olds do. An adult doing it gives me douche chills.
---
I don’t mind him being in the game. I just despise his out of place voicelines in the menu
---
I see so many people complaining about 'adding more grind' but I just don't see how that's an appropriate view. This isn't adding more grind' to anyone that hasn't 100% already completed everything to grind for in the game, what this would do is add more reward for the grind that's already there, which to me sounds like a win-win.
---
Items in the free portion of the pass - win for players that aren't buying it
---
Items the paid portion of the pass - win for people that enjoyed the game and will be playing it anyway
---
The semi legitimate attempt at an argument against it is that it's paid content in a game that already needs to be bought.. but people taking that argument now that haven't been complaining about the store for months now are just jumping on a bandwagon then.
---
A common argument is 'theyre so greedy' but what's not greedy is making all of their original content chapters earnable entirely through in-game currency and always free maps. But they never seem to get props for that, just bashed for how much they're money grubbing and milking players
---
I didn't when I first started playing Pig, I thought BBQ and Whispers was basically like the OP combo. So I totally understand others not knowing. And if you don't know and you stick around because of it you've unknowingly wasted so much time, which killers don't exactly have that luxury.
---
With the omega blink you don't need more than three
---
I don’t play Killer often, so I’m always at rank 20.
---
I do like how killers complain about Surviviors DCing when they go down, but then DCing when Surviviors get the gens done
---
dont you love it? :)
---
These are all really good! I can’t wait for the next set
---
Makes me feel good
---
Rippppppppppp
---
And yep, this was me taking Insidious Leatherface after another SWF bully squad. I get it, I play during prime time because I’m now an overnight worker. But fuck you if you think I’m gonna just sit back and deal with your four man flashlight clicking teabagging trash squad. I’ll insidious camp with instant saw and ebony mori all of you then laugh and say “ez” postgame while you all cry.
---
Thank you!!
---
That would hardly make a difference. In fact that could actually help the killer because the noise notification can distract them mid chase. If I don't hear anything loud and obnoxious I won't give a damn.
---
All of them can work with bad aim , clown doesn't need to precisely hit a target since the gas cloud, plagues power is making Survivors sick which can be done by a lot more than vomiting ON a survivor + it can be tracked because it isn't a one shot but more like a trail .
---
On the other hand Nurse is literally slower than a survivor which makes it impossible to catch . 
---
Let's be honest most games don't try hard to fit with console because it's limiting thier control + I'm sure most DbD players are on PC
---
Of *course* one of them had a Brand New Part!
---
You’re wrong
---
Controller: I am going to kermit suicide!
---
what fucked up reality do you live in where cringe means i think im better than someone
---
Ooof. Short joke. That's a *low blow*
---
michael isnt s
---
post sucks
---
This, but also, if someone gets knocked down while you're opening the door, stop the door at 99% until the person is hooked at least. Easy Blood Warden counter, but no randoms know to do it.
---
This guy probably can’t see his shadow when the pig is behind him
---
I mean, someone with the name true talent is not expected to NOT have an ego lol.
---
Your comment intrigues me. Lol care to elaborate for an old stoner? lol
---
To Me The Spirit is the BEST killer in the game I hardly ever lose a match. I started keeping a record of the matches Iv played with the Spirit and for the past 12 rounds only 6 survivors survived 3- waited until the 3rd survivor was put on a hook so they could Insta-hatch. I gave 2 the hatch because they showed skills. Last 1 actually made it out the exit gate. So out of 48 survivors 6 survived, leaving 42 that died by either sacrifice, Mori, DC, &amp; 2 were endgame impailed. The last endgame kill was AWESOME killed them right in front of the exit barrier. The build that I use, I havnt seen or heard of anyone playing her the way I do.
---
The vast majority of paid cosmetics just make you stand out even more
---
This payback circle jerk is probably a lot of why the DBD community is what it is.
---
No one cares
---
love the new engine, graphics much better
---
This reality dummy
---
Thats one of my favorite screams. Idk why.
---
*tombstone Myers intensifies
---
Just like survivors DC for every single little thing. First to be found? DC. First to go down? DC. First to get hooked? DC.
---
This was so painful
---
I will personally Kickstart a refund campaign for this guy.
---
Twist. The old lady at the atm is being held hostage by the other lady's booty. Crime comes in many forms.
---
Also one time I downed someone right when they missed a self heal skill check and they weren't in dream but still downed
---
Makes sense, that's a good way of playing it. Many new people dont understand the fundamental of the game
---
ok
---
gens done = lose. being downed for the first time ≠ lose but = means you denied a bbq stack. that is a crime in my book.
---
...I made a shitty pun. That's all. &lt;3
---
Anyway, to treat this a little more seriously, I think Spirit is objectively a great Killer. Her power is very strong and is actually helpful in the chase, and Monitor &amp; Abuse makes her demonic. I'm also very fond of her design aesthetic because I'm pretty big on Feudal Japanese Culture. 
---
That said, I personally can't play her simply due to not only my lack of skill with her power but also the fact that my hearing is far from excellent. Imagine not really being able to hear Survivors and having to use scratch marks and Predator to find them.
---
Yeah same
---
I feel like the circle with your fingers is more of what an 11 year old would do
---
How is it not the exact same thing? Gloating either way
---
Pretty good job so far
---
I only nod when I catch someone in a trap with trapper but then I walk away and let them free themselves, the good after cancels out the jerk during though, right?
---
Yikes 100
---
Really feel like the Clown would be higher on the list
---
I’m a Susie, and I’m offended
---
Thats not going to make BBQ OP. Taking up two perks for the combo seems worth to me. There are plenty of really good perks that would probably be much better than using both those slots. Just adding in Iron Maiden doesnt make BBQ game breaking or you would see a lot more of it.
---
I love this community.
---
Or tunnely
---
Turbo virign..... Ah God
---
Now I can have an instablind and an instaheal, god bless
---
Pig should be in a special top tier for those squeaks :)
---
Ayy good job! Continuing to play as and learn her will definitely be worth it in the long run lol. Good nurses on PS4 are hard to come by, so it'd be nice to see another one. :)
---
Nah, just a Halloween flashlight.
---
Hahaha I feel you
---
But then it happens to be haunted grounds
---
But that's the wraith mori!
---
You know sticking to your guns about something that was never said, isn't agreement or disagreement.  It's neurosis.
---
Why? I Can't COMPREHEND WHAT GOES ON IN THEIR MIND?
---
WHY DC? YOU'RE SCREWING UP YOUR WHOLE TEAM!
---
DONT DO IT YOU STUPID MISERABLE FUCK
---
I am sorry I am just facing a lot of teammates dcing
---
heaven &amp; hell
---
It was right there OP....
---
There are two changes that I can think of for Trapper and I'd take either  
---
A.) He starts with more traps (at LEAST 3 to start)
---
B.) All the traps on the map start as activated, so while he still does have to go around to get them, they can also benefit him early on if survivors aren't careful
---
But trap-daddy needs SOMETHING
---
I had this exact thing happen to me awhile ago. Everyone DCed not 5 minutes in, I just stayed around to see what the pig did. She let me finish some gens and get hatch. Got to like it when the killer is a better teammate than your actual teammates.
---
I’m confused, what was transphobic about this.
---
his little stun sound cracks me up! poor doctor
---
PIG MAINS RISE UP! 🐷
---
Which fits him more so thats probably why the change happened
---
Lol. No.
---
I'm still hella worried about the rework honestly, Freddy is the only killer I can get 4ks on so effectively that I had to create an image to respond to the overwhelming amount of salty hatemail. Please BHVR, don't massacre my boy
---
earlier today i ran into a freddy doing the same cheap ass thing of leaving someone down so that the hatch wont spawn 
---
with end game collapse that cheap tactic should have died but then again i ran that freddy around for like 5 minutes so it makes sense he wasnt good enough to reliably get to the hatch first
---
basically at this point the only maps I play are either coldwind or Macmillan estate sorry but playing each of those in 9 games gets boring
---
everybody gangster till terror radius disappears in the basement
---
Feng main, can confirm.
---
That cross map chainsaw was satisfying af. Poor Kate though
---
..and there are doctors that can help with that.
---
I have always thought it is the coolest sound in the game.
---
Way to describe Johnny Cage
---
Loading into a game with a good nurse might as well just involve all the survivors spawning on the basement hooks with the endgame timer active
---
I always do this if the poor bastards teammates DC
---
Oh yeah its not like I religiously follow the political climate in America or anything you right
---
guilty
---
Ouch, sorry to hear that. Hopefully you can release some stress by killing survivors! Have fun
---
You can know their location
---
And they would have to do an action to hang up
---
So in a chase if you called them they would either need to run around with a ringing phone or spend time to hang it up
---
Maybey he vould also stalk idk
---
But phone calls would be cool
---
Scummy how? I'm just curious if by that you mean making strong builds as that has been my experience around this sub. People dont seem to think you should try to win.
---
I use shadowborn because you have a bigger FOV  making you able to see more and maybe corn movement you could also play Doctor to find people or if you feel like big shock cocc doc isn't your style you could maybe try Freddy with his dream tracking. Those are all the tips I have you could use nurses calling or deerstalker also but don't.
---
HAIL YOUR QUEEN, AMANDA!
---
GlenOck would be proud of you and the neas in that game
---
tfw you equip ruin but it turns into no one left behind
---
She's slowly becoming my new main, with Claudette I'll get tunneled and camped no matter how good of a teammate I am or how fairly I play. Yet with Feng I'll have killers give up chases w/ me for reasons unknown. I think it might have to do with my newfound love for Alert, it helps me keep track of the killer when I have to throw down pallets.
---
Don't forget Judith's tombstone you can make 4 gens 0 hooks and then Evil 3 and 2 companions dead :V
---
I don’t really play Killer (and when I do I try not to actually sacrifice anyone), so I tend to stay around the higher ranks.
---
yes, you're so caring of others you accuse people of being mentally ill for disagreeing with you, lol
---
I've been hit and picked up from across the map before
---
I dislike battlepasses and it has nothing to do with fortnite. I dont want it because the current cosmetics are fine as they are. Battlepasses is a greedy addition to any game as it forces players to grind non stop or else they miss out on the exclusive cosmetics that will go pretty quickly.
---
I have no doubt if they add it I'll buy it. Now with an arcade style oriented game I'll practically be locked into playing it so I have to grind up the cells to get the next seasons pass. It isnt a free game, itll be just greedy adding it. 
---
Also dont forget it isnt like it's free cosmetics vs no cosmetics at all. They're not going to start making twice as much cosmetics, we will start getting lesser quality or less in general free cosmetics to glamorise the battle pass cosmetics. If they were to add season exclusive cosmetics, I'd much rather them add it as a season reward, something that no one really has a problem with
---
The best thing u can do is unninstal dx12 and install dx11 or u can change ur windows, probably that happened if u dont have the paid version of windows
---
Let us also not forget, they are likely still paying towards that 16 million, from buying the publishing rights from starbreeze.
---
Judging by the build he was probably messing around
---
Piggy should be tier on her own
---
Because essentially people think "It's a waste of a slot", like they *have* to run meta perks every single round or they won't be able to fuction.
---
It’s almost impossible because they hide their name, but sometimes i can suspect based on cosmetics.
---
“I don’t think it’s OP, but let’s nerf it anyway!”
---
Had a few selfish perk idea that wouldn't encourage dickery.
---
Essentially they would be self buffs to your actions speed healing speed increasing durability of items.
---
However If you support your teammates in any way like healing or unhooking the perks are disabled for the rest of the match.
---
Imo, it's because it's useless to someone who can consistantly get great skill checks even with a few failures you'd probably be be better off with another perk. 
---
The other reason is that the perk is completely useless against killers with small or irregular terror radious' and right now that's a little under half meaning it's only an effective counter half of the time. You'd be better off running small game which it is a counter all of the time.
---
The point you responded to was a reasoning behind why "4K 'no matter what' isn't the objective of the game." 
---
Yet it was immediately twisted to "I read this as.."  No.  It's exactly as I said it.  I didn't imply shit to read into.  You can play the game how you want, I agree.  Viva Freedom.
---
How you want to play it as you've described it, is exactly why 4K isn't an unconditional win.  Enough players play like this with the game in the state it's in now, and it won't survive or grow.
---
The mental illness bit.. well, that's something *I'm* reading into.  See how enjoyable this conversation twisting is?  Anyway, that's enough on that. You're ignored from here on.
---
Agreed
---
Was really hoping that they'd create unique closing animations but oh well
---
Blackface leatherface. I'm not even overexaggerating this a little, I have rarely ever versed any blackface leatherface that dont just stand in front of the hook and rev their chainsaw. The ones who dont do this also always brings a mori and NOED. 
---
No exceptions
---
Just because you don't think something isn't OP doesn't mean some balance changes can't be made...
---
k
---
Where’s Plague?
---
It's not that unheard of depending on what time in the day you play. I play during day time when most people are at work, and I am often paired with the same killers from the day before.
---
Okay, but no
---
She isn't there yet in the tier list website but she's also with the rest of the killers
---
Well they did pretty damn cool job on the Spirit animation so im happy.
---
I used it all the time when I started, it was great because I would play with my friends (and we we're all new to the game saw was the first dlc I got) so we had no idea where totems were so I would power through gens with stake out while my friends tried to find totems/get chased by the killer
---
That's how you know they're super grown up. Only grown up's use such serious big people words.
---
:D
---
I was kind of hoping they'd do something special for every killer, maybe let them use their powers in a unique way but yeah spirit is really nice
---
Gotta love Devour Hope 😁
---
I really like this idea. It feels like how Silent Hill flicks on and off. Much spooky.
---
I didn’t cut anything out. I took a one clip from a four hour stream where I’m being talked about the entire time. He did say something that bad, what he said was incredibly transphobic. If he would’ve called me the N-Word we wouldn’t be having this conversation. What happened that rustled his jimmies this bad was a game we had at the beginning of rank reset where he says I tunneled him. Which I didn’t. He then invited me to a party and began screaming and cursing me out and calling me a cunt. So I said “whatever pussy” and I left the party. Since then, him and his twitch viewers and a couple friends he plays with have been slandering my name. He talks about having people banned from Xbox and said he would pay people to ban me. All because he died in a video game. I’m a brutally honest person even when I’m in the wrong I’ll admit it and move on.
---
And no, I haven’t encountered this much hatred in a fucking video game.
---
They got Bruce Campbell to do voice lines, they’re gonna use them.
---
No , after the game it shows me with my item in my hand, then it says item lost on the next page. Xbox btw.
---
Just try a good hillbilly or nurse with ruin+BBQ+insta-chainsaw/more blinks. You can miss the 4 kills only if the last survivor is lucky and find the hatch. Sometimes survivors have no chance to win, and sometimes killers have no chance to win too it just depends on the game.
---
“nearly five balanced landings” 
---
what??
---
Damn you did it pretty quick I still got that take 150 hits bullshit from Bill which is even harder with the borrowed time rework :/
---
Your contribution to Blood Warden is deeply hated.
---
Oh shit, I thought Balanced Landing had a 20 second cooldown for some reason, I'm really stupid. I don't run it so I forgot. I'll edit the post, deepest apologies.
---
Final swing
---
The Legion changes are live with Patch 2.7.0, which you can read about [here](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/61785/patch-notes-2-7-0-mid-chapter).
---
I like the changes a lot, both from a Killer and a Survivor viewpoint! It’s just a bit different. 115% movement speed is really nice, but you’ll have to keep in mind that one missed swing will also remove you from Feeal Frenzy. He’s still good at applying pressure, then focusing on the last Survivor he hit in Frenzy. I’d recommend just reading the changes for yourself (or watching a video with new Legion!) to see if it’s your kinda thing. If you didn’t like old Legion, you probably won’t like new Legion, either. Things aren’t *that* different, and the thought behind his power is still the same.
---
Legion is good in the actual game now, yes.
---
What? What survivor? I haven’t seen any new cosmetics for my survivors and I thought it was the tie leatherface has
---
Bad Manners or Bad Mouth.
---
watch the 3 year anniversary DBD video on Youtube. It shows less than a second of Freddy and people are assuming stuff and losing their mind
---
It's not YouTube, I still see it as I scroll through the subreddit. There's already enough reposts so I'm just saying it would make sense to cut down on the stupidest type of posts. 
---
People are literally just posting lists with no purpose. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/brz0mn/killer_tier_list_but_its_based_on_absolutely/?utm_source=reddit
---
Dwight's got the Black and Blue cosmetic
---
I just played Mint Rag Hag + NOED. Nobody survived and I felt like an asshole.
---
I swear I never had an issue looping old Legion so long as they didn't moonwalk.
---
*Entity Displeased*
---
Streetwise plus that perk and an insta heal with toolbox
---
Sounds like cancer
---
Please. Pedophilia is also a psychological/medical condition. A very bad and flawed example to use.
---
I don’t know about you but I find it sort of hard to hit survivors with a hatchet at ranks 10-1. Survivors in those ranks usually look behind them and dodge hatchets. So I think it’s sort of fair, probably going to have a lot of people disagreeing but whatever
---
A pillow and another human being are vastly different.
---
Probably one of those basement campers
---
To be honest, I think it is too gimicky. Way too much to code in while this stalk is simple yet fun.
---
he was joke before the patch
---
he is joke after ther patch
---
another typical bhvr garbage dlc
---
I still think it could stand to be nerfed to 60 seconds, or maybe 30 if we're being harsh. 90 seconds is just too long a reward for hitting one hatchet, even if it can be tough at times, because it basically says "Dead Hard, love it, now let's throw it in the trash can, it sucks, useless." And while we're at it I wish they'd rework Iri Heads into something else instead of just making Huntress a better Plague.
---
You got brown chaser tho
---
Yeah it’s ridiculous when people say that. If a NOED managed to turn a 0k into a 4K then it wasn’t the perk being OP that allowed that to happen, it was the survs playing like fucking morons
---
Oh. You're on Xbox. It might be a console related bug then. Pretty stupid and frustrating bug if I must say. Hope they can fix it.
---
Don't use different perks except maybe one just to help you do better at looping/running. Hiding will only work at lower ranks or if you just get lucky, looping however is something you can always do, no luck needed.
---
I watch Monto a lot and he has some videos on old legion. I thought he was a pretty appealing character back then, aside from the obvious downsides of his abilities. You just need to know how to work around them I guess. Thanks
---
Np! Check out Monto's video from today if you wanna! He plays some post-2.7.0 Legion in it, so you can compare.

You might be talking about something else but do you mean the fan that was banned from overwatch tournaments for doing it in the background of their casters? I believe they went back on that decision.

There was a post about it on their subreddit. It wasn't the biggest deal but it was annoying and didn't need to be changed since not many people would make that connection without looking insane.
---
Ya know, for as much flack as we give BHVR, it really is awesome they made it this far and care as much as they do with what little they had.   
---
Glad to be a fan and supporter
---
Well I played a lot at high levels and I think a nurse main with a strong build can stop whatever the fac he wants to stop xD
---
;(
---
I mean it fits the model if you think about it. For events you can either grind for the skin or pay for them (at least now you can pay for them). A battlepass is a similar concept except not seasonal but instead limited. So make it a better deal to buy the battle pass and grind for the skins but hey if you don't want to do the grind or don't have the time then they will be available in the shop after the pass is gone or something.
---
this post is so wholesome
---
Even if you were camping, although it pisses people off, it is a viable tactic and exploiting a weakness, same with tunneling and anything else like that
---
Marth was able to demonstrate how an effective SWF team can dominate killers. Most of his friends from Depip squad stopped playing though as far as I remember but not many people are at their level of survivor gameplay/coordination. If everyone played like that then it would be a lot worse.
---
What if how well you see him is based on proximity
---
Is it? I just wanted to tell people about all the references that Freddy has in his add ons and the tid bits people didn't know.
---
I suppose that makes sense, but then they shouldn’t be so out of place. Or they should add some line from
---
Other characters
---
YEEEEEEEEE
---
haw
---
If I get tunneled off the hook the way I see it it's my teams fault for not waiting long enough to save or if I'm being camped it's again their fault for not taking a hit for me. Had a game earlier where wraith brought a mori and I had dying light, he camped me on the hook and my teammates came to unhook me, but when the wraith started uncloaking they all ran away like a bunch of pussies on full health so I was instantly downed again and mori'd
---
If you pop all 5 gens as fast as possible and leave you also don't pip. 
---
If you kill y'all 4 survivors immediately and nothing else you don't pip. Both get equally screwed lol.
---
If i recall it was something along the lines of the character needs to be recognizable at their core and they can't stray too far from the designs of the characters. That may sound not limiting but when you realize a character like freddy is recognizable for his hat, sweater, and glove you realize there really isn't much you can do.
---
They will never do this. 
---
Survivors would avoid every decent killer and bully shitcans. 
---
Move on.
---
&gt; Yah, so what is the risk for the killer?
---
The risk is that survivors literally get to remove his perk.
---
Exactly what I think when I cleanse a HG. I’d rather it pop off on you as opposed to when I’m getting chased hahaha
---
Exactly! And I've Google and googled and never been able to find many people acknowledging the issue. It's so annoying. I have a great pc that reccomends I play the game on ultra yet I have to play on low at 0% resolution to get the least laggy skillchecks
---
Oh really? Thought that one was actually easier now too; that one and the 100 hex totems take a lot of patience hahahah
---
The thing is that you say hes said all these things but you decide to use a clip that isnt even very bad. The fact you used this clip and not the one of him "screaming at you and witch hunting you" doesn't help your case.
---
Either fits him but only one was the original symbol for "If you see me make this sign below the waist you get hit" which is literally what he does after you zoom out of seeing his hand. I feel like with the ok sign the reference is harder to miss and some people that just see him flipping the bird won't get it.
---
well it made me smile a lot, so im gonna say yes :)
---
I mean tbh that’s the point of meta perks. It’s fun to run a plunderer build or healing one, but so many perks are so shitty that whats the point of using one of them over adrenaline or balanced landing?
---
Nah because now borrowed time doesn't give the saivor another hit, that's one less hit you can take
---
Well I'm glad it did something to make people happy
---
Small game is useless if there are no hex, plus it doesn’t even tell you how many totems are left. On top of that it has a super small range. Wasted perk if you ask me.
---
We're gonna live forever, borrowed time, prove thyself, and bond. No exhaustion perk but you can find people on gens and you'll get extra points for helping with prove thyself. The other 2 perks are for when you can get an unhook WGLF is basically the survivor equivalent of BBQ.
---
Also, yes you did cut things out as you shown the clip of him yelling at you right after you said something at him to provoke him. That's literally the definition of cutting things out, I'm sure he didn't witchhunt you, scream at you and complain about you for 2 hours straight just because he thought you played toxic.
---
Just going off of entirely selfish means getting an instant 4K doesn't make you good or challenging just because you ran Knockout and Nurse's Calling on Nurse, it just makes you an asshole, and the game reflects that very well. 
---
If you want to actually progress it isn't about getting all those sick 4Ks but getting max points, and getting max points requires you to play less dickish. Whether or not you see that as pity is irrelevant.
---
I mean he’s rank 11 not really a noob.
---
Update: I and another person walked into it, it does NOT deal any damage. It DID however make one Huntress very salty so she just murdered us instead of enjoying the meme.
---
A invisible wraith camping a survivor with insta-uncloak addons, a nurse with 5 blinks, a huntress with iridescent head and a ebony mori just to name a few.  
---
I do think the killer emblem's need an adjustment(Especially lightbringer maybe give the killer a automatic silver or gold if the killer manages  to close the the hatch or get a 3/4 K before the gates get powered )  but OP's suggestion will swing the favor a bit too much on the killers side and encourage certain play styles more.    
---
And in general certain killer/survivors builds are just plain annoying if not outright bullshit.  This does not include maps where either the killer or the survivor has a clear advantage over the other, like the game or haddonfield.
---
It's amazing how they accidentally describe themselves when they get angry.
---
I love the internet!
---
It's just bad luck.
---
It’s completely rng. So just bad luck, I’m afraid.
---
No. You just need one iridescent insta heal to bring them back to full health. Using two is just waste of them.
---
In that case Sloppy Butcher, Whispers/Bitter Murmur,   A Nurse's Calling and Deerstalker is a solid build on her. You should get Ruin from Hag, Barbecue and Chili from Cannibal and Discordance and Iron Maiden from Legion.
---
He's also a pedophile.
---
Doc with distressing and BBQ. Any killer with BBQ really you should be getting around 50k per match before a points offering.
---
What does spirit do?
---
Ive 99% the door multiple occasions with a teammate going down only for a survivor to run behind me and open it.... last time it happened, killer had blood warden and noed....
---
I said it before but knockout nurse's calling nurse is a pure slug build you can't really beat largely due to the knockout side with calling being used to make sure no one gets healed. 
---
It rewards no points and the survivors do flat out nothing all game and it's debatably the easiest way to play nurse and is a really easy way to get a 4k. It's scummy by design, and you can double pip as Killer with one to two kills tops: 4ks aren't the goal and the game gives you plenty of ways of seeing that.
---
I don't have legion or cannibal, and I kinda don't wanna spend money, so I will probably go to shrine of secrets and pray for those things, and I don't have Nurse as a teachable
---
Camping is for people that just want a kill more than points. Campers end a game with around 15k points, killers that don't camp end the game with around 25k before bbq or offerings.
---
Again, removing the perk is not free though. Where does the survivor wasted time goes into the equation? To remove the perk the survivor has to cleanse the totems, which is not free, it takes time away from helping someone out of a hook, doing gens, etc. 
---
It's counter is effectively positive to killers. It is just a fact, it sinks survivors time in something that will hugely benefit the killer if they don't. So it is time investment to not get the killer to do dumb stuff.
---
Daaaamn lol
---
Clown porn best porn
---
Shrouds are still useful to see if you have some pissant reflex DCers in game.  Burn a shroud of separation and see if you get dumped back to lobby a few seconds later.
---
She holds her katana with both of her hands and plants it into the hatch, closing it. Pretty cool shit
---
Starting the mindgames before the game even starts, I like it.
---
Except that's totally the point and the game let's you know that. Your goal is to max out those points right?  Then do what gives you points. 
---
Or 4k every game and get none. That's not punishment, that's the risk reward system in play.
---
Don't chase, don't break gens, don't do any extra things as killer, get a 4k slug double pip
---
Omegalol. 
---
Summed up in your own language so you can see how dumb it is.
---
What else would you be called?  You've posted this dumb question several times so spell it out.
---
Cr1tikal is that you?
---
No offense but I’m cringing
---
Yep but I mean that isn't really a fun fact thats more of a depressing fact.
---
I've had a lot of fun swapping out ruin for lullaby, middle-higher ranks will see that it's just lullaby and try to ignore it so you have time to get tokens and then they realize that they can't work through it and have to start looking for it halfway through the match.
---
He is a streamer. He was definitely the biggest DBD legend. I don't know if he is father of 360s, but he is also know as 360 legend. 3 years ago it was possible to do chest and hook jukes. When you was running around chest and you pressed M1, you was teleported to to chest. Same for hook. So it was possible avoid killers attacks by this way. He has unique games style and community loved him. I think he has video on his YouTube channel. In this video he talks about reasons why he left DBD.
---
Yes!!
---
Sex during the trial gives the killer an instant mori. We've all seen slashers, we know how this ends!
---
I really dont understand why everyone is so upset about this. We dont even have all the details yet anyway. If it ends up costing actual money and you dont want to pay for it, dont buy it?
---
I mean i dont try and get chased a lot and to tell the truth if youre stealthy enough i wont even know she had those addons.
---
What happend when the killer tried to pick up dwight? What stunned the killer?
---
Is that like a personal attack?
---
Haven't seen the Darn meme in awhile, bet it's gonna be spammed when the Freddy rework is shown. That's if its bad of course
---
Get leatherface for bbq to farm points, and find a killer you can play without add-ons. 
---
Anytime I need points I just play nurse with bbq so I'm getting a lot of points and I'm not using any points buying add-ons to play the nurse.
---
The last part of this is very unclear. It sounds like you gave them the exit, but your last part says you’ll take the free sacrifice points. Which is it? 
---
Regardless, I’d recommend you not play like that and just close the hatch if you find it first. Don’t be a loser.
---
Only it's the entity doing the mori-ing
---
Disagreed. The game isn't punishing you for not killing, it is punishing you for killing too quickly. Matches shouldn't last less than 3 minutes. It is not a rewarding experience for both sides. People used to just stock up on ebony moris for this reason.
---
I would say so, but I'm shit with characters like her.
---
Depends if you use any killer enough you can master them. It may just take longer.
---
BBQ just was on Shrine, so you will probably need to wait a long time for ger it again. You can save shards and buy Legion, you can buy every non licensed killers with shards ( so every killer except Myers, Freddy, Pig and Cannibal ).
---
Remove noed and try
---
That fact isnt fun.
---
I do, what I’m saying is don’t stand there like a fucking idiot
---
Yeah I was indifferent on whether to get it or wait, especially since I was super new, and I didn't want to be toxic
---
99% of my games are survivor, so I never play killer.  My killer demoted to rank 19 and i felt bad crushing complete newbies just cause I know how to play killer from playing survivor, so i usually two hook everyone and then once i catch em again i just slug and let their team pick em up, so the game goes on.  I usually let everyone love, everyone gets points, and newbies with 2 perks arent discouraged from the game
---
I've tried her a couple of times and I just can't get used to it. She is Definitely not hard if you play her for like a day or two.
---
Lol Maybe if you didn’t throw your nudes around Reddit, you wouldn’t get dumped.
---
Never get to use it
---
Doctor needs to shock it closed.
---
Marth88 did a few experiments with his depip squad at rank 1 where he did 100 games with his swf group to show how op survivors can be. He did it a few times sometimes with perks, without perks, and not leaving anyone behind (since when he showed the devs results they said well they just left people behind and didn't try to save them so they did a run where if they could save a person off hook they had to do it.) 
---
Anyways the videos are all on his youtube by number and killer and gimmick. They also keep track of the amount of pips the killers got by the end (since it was the old system for pipping where you can tell if the killer pipped or not).
---
Since I made the claim here are some links if you want to see what I am talking about: 
---
[Game 16 vs Nurse No Perks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yv4I8cCD8wE)
---
[Game 27 vs Nurse No Perks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7lttxSAlNQ)
---
[Game 52 vs Nurse No Perks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2-oPUpiUF8)
---
There were some others but I think that is enough and you can find more nurse games and other killers on his channel. I know the videos are old but survivor gameplay has not changed significantly so everything they showed they can do to these killers stands and shows how overpowered survivors can be if they know what they are doing.
---
What a twist
---
No, you can get silver if you escape and are crawling out.
---
Weird because that's exactly what I said and had in mind, but sadly he just kicks it, like the rest of the killers do
---
I can see the response now. 
---
“Dude, end game wasn’t even active. The perk was useless all game.”
---
I had a killer use the shroud of separation. No survivors brought in offerings.   We all spawned in a diagonal shaped corner of the map.  Great job game.
---
Its been quite awhile since I've encountered a killer like this, on the other hand though.... that's all I'm  saying.
---
Yep very unfun. However another fun fact tho is that Freddy is getting a rework that most likely is going to make him mid tier
---
Death stomp.
---
Waiting for the email had me more stressed than actual job applications looool
---
I'm a freddy main, so I'm kind of afraid they'll make his kit less fun.
---
However, his current kit does a really bad job of representing the movies, hopefully his rework will fix that.
---
Im just gonna kill all of you survivors. And killers im be at the hatch enjoy your 3k.
---
All exhaustion add ons need looking at tbh.  Clowns is the only one that tilts me cause its super easy to apply.
---
Sounds like you need to look into “fair use and parody “.
---
I use bbq, surveillance, ruin, and haunted grounds. Imo if you need enduring/spirit fury on pig you're not doing it right. Also make you choice is a pretty mediocre perk on a walking killer. Surveillance is really good if you can't find someone that was on a gen just kick it, then when it lights up you know they're working on it and you can use your crouch to go back and get a free hit or even a grab.
---
I could see this being added
---
I just got Freddy and oh boy I love him mainly why I did this fun fact already got him P1 hoping to get him to P2 by next week. I feel he'll be less difficult to 4k with but more harder to master and more challenging. I feel pretty excited for the rework.
---
Adrenaline doesn't heal you every match but it's hardly a waste of the perk slot innit? Not only does this bad boy detects totems it also detects traps! Even cleansing the dull one gives you 600 (SIX HUNDRED) BP, which is no small change. I can't fathom how someone can not see how amazing this perk is...
---
Its random bro it just happens to be devour.
---
Scrolled down to try and find Plague. I absolutely agree with your placement for her on this list
---
Don't use the lunge, it's way quicker to just stand back up, and there's also no warning noise when you stand up, unlike the dash. Only use dash to mind game at pallets
---
I swear, Ruin either lasts for 10 seconds or 10 minutes. Far less often does it end up being found and cleansed midgame. The RNG is just a little aggravating as both survivor and killer.
---
i think if you kill all 4 people it means either you are good or the build you brought to the map is good, at least relative to your opponents, actually
---
that being said I don't go for super tryhard meta builds because that's not very interesting, but I'm not going to mechanically dumb myself down out of pity and nor should anyone else.
---
Listen here, the reason why it's hard to find games as survivor on console, is because no one plays killer on console. Stop harassing the devs, it's not the matchmaking system that causes this.
---
How would you been toxic by get it Barbecue and Chili from Shrine ?
---
Oh wait top right, I tought for some reason top left.
---
Behind the mask was a great movie, it is a parody homage, kinda like scream but very different at the same time.
---
ACTUALLY, Depending on the killer, I WANT TO get tunneled so I can help the others escape. Like Huntress. But If its a Trapper or Spirit I won't last long. Also like bullying Nurses, coming from someone that mainly plays surv But also plays Nurse btw
---
Could it be any worse than what he is, now?
---
I had to fight to not laugh out loud as I saw this while in a bus. Well done!
---
People DC against tombstone myers because they think he's OP. I dont really care, but certain people do OP.
---
Drop pallets on him, let him chase you, let him smack gens you are working on, let him hit you if you have self-care, etc.
---
While I upvote you because I don't think you deserved the down vote I still agree it's a bad idea. I love trapper to, he's my second choice after bing bong, but I can see how exploitable that would be.
---
&gt; Again, I feel like you didn’t understand the point of my original comment, I was being sarcastic. I think giving survivors a pip just for surviving would be stupid, the reason I think that’s stupid is because it’s the equivalent of a killer putting down 4 brain dead survivors
---
I understood your original comment. I am saying, with 100% certainty, that you are wrong in this. Ranking systems may, for example, reduce the amount you rank up if you defeat people way lower rank than you, but I cannot think of a good modern game that actively *de-ranks you* for not winning by *enough* vs bad players.
---
The purpose of a rank system is to rise people in rank when they preform better than expected, and lower them likewise. The actual content of a game traditionally does not matter, and should not be tracked except in extreme circumstances, because the ranking system is not tracking moment to moment play but the overall level of preformance.
---
DBD *is* such an exception, because while there are two sides, there are 5 'teams' as it were with goals that aren't accomplished necessarily together. So in DBD's case tracking individual performance makes sense.
---
But if I go into counterstrike, and am matched against air breathers who can't play a damn, and go 15-0 with the best weapons because we won all the rounds and got all the money, and they only had pistols? *I.* *Sill.* *Rank.* *Up.*
---
Rank systems *should not say* 'that was too easy.' That creates perverse incentives where players are now *de-rank* by playing extremely well, which means now your rank system does not accurately measure player skill, and is bad. So, yes, if you demolish 4 potatos, you should rank up, because while it didn't challenge you to beat those potatoes, it *indicated you and they are both ranked improperly.* It is the job of the rank system to thus move them down and you up, and to continue to watch you to see if it was a fluke or not. Yes, in that game it *didn't* say a lot to beat them, but as a whole, over many games, it will say a lot if you smash every team you come across by a *lot.*
---
&gt;A perfect game would be everything you said PLUS 3 hooks per survivor with all the saves,
---
No, that is sloppy as shit play. The Rank system says that is good play, but I know of no sane person who would say all the survivors getting hooked multiple times is 'clean' play. It objectively isn't, getting hooked is one of the worst things that can happen to you and is *the* metric to determine sub-optimal play. The fact the rank system rewards survivors getting hooked and trading spots on it is *god damn loony toons.*
---
The rank system should reward you *not* getting hooked, and helping other survivors *not* get hooked, because that is good play.
---
Likewise, killer side, the idea the killer is 'showing a lack of skill' by not allowing the survivor to be unhooked is *actively dumb.*
---
Imagine if you had to, in star craft, try to win with as few units as possible, and if you made too many you wouldn't rank up no matter what. An enforced "Shooting the moon" (AKA: Winning every possible point) is actually laughable. Just as not getting hooked indicates good survivor play, not letting survivors constantly get free hook saves indicates good killer play.
---
"Good play" does *not* mean making things arbitrarily harder for yourself to impress an automated system. That is bad game design because now you are introducing good and fun interactions and strategies into your game and telling players not to use them, that the fun things to do like snagging survivors who tried to go for a cheeky hook rescue are *bad.*
---
Mark Rosewater put it best when he said "The fun thing to do in your game should also be how you win." Well being forced to watch people unhook so you can get your optimal emblems *isn't fun.* It also is you *artificially* playing worse.
---
You are conflating being able to win with a self handicap as a measure of ultimate skill. That may be the case, there is a reason why you can go it solo in Yuker or try to knife in CS. But these systems are not enforced by the rank system because rank systems exist to gauge *normal* play. No one actually tries to play DBD my maximizing hook rotations on both sides, so the rank system *should not be evaluating you on that.*
---
If you want to encourage people to do things like patrol rather than camp (Which is a fine goal) the rank system is not your game design tool to do that. You do it by looking at other systems and why camping is so insanely attractive to the point that you, as in DBD's designers, admit you can't enforce a no-camping rule without breaking the game. In DBD's case it is because the risk-reward of not defending the hook when you suspect a rescue is coming is not so much not in your favor as much as the consequences for being wrong are so insanely huge it ends the game. You want the 'lore' of the killer trying to hunt other people to work? You don't enforce it via the rank system, you do things like make survivors getting unhooked way less negative for a killer's chance to *win the match.*
---
&gt;As a survivor if you can consistently stay behind the killer the whole round and run away every time he downs someone else without dying themself, (you know that thing that we all see every survivor do in every game we play... more sarcasm), I’ve got bad news for you dude, that is 1 of 2 things: a great survivor, or a terrible killer.
---
This is actually so easy that it became a meta strategy at high ranks when emblems came out. The killer is unable to realistically chase you or punish you without giving up a hook event which obviously is insane and against their own interests, so what a lot of people did was literally run around the killer as they were going to hook, because the killer *can't stop you.* This is its own problem (survivor aggression is comically easy whenever the killer is trying to accomplish anything other than specifically chasing you) but it cannot be denied this is not a hard thing to do. It is, again, way more efficient a way to get emblem points than actually unhooking.
---
I literally still do it as a rank 1 survivor. Its... not at all hard. Same reason why you should be very comfortable bodyblocking when the killer is carrying someone: There are essentially no consequences the killer can apply in this scenario. Hence, its a non-skilled interaction that doesn't advance your team's or your own ability to 'win' and thus it is silly it is literally one of the most rewarded things you can do. 'Hiding' within 5 meters of the killer as they hook for 15 seconds is literally just a free emblem, not including the points you get from 'hiding' as you leave or even just wait for the killer to move on.
---
&gt;It was clearly too easy to rank prior and I’m in support of making ranking up more meaningful
---
I agree. And to be clear I more advocate for the categories to be rebalanced, not changed. 
---
Perhaps, for example, making the categories interact more so as to reward efficient play. Ex: Repairing 2 gens and dying shouldn't be a pip up, nor should repairing 2 gens, unhooking and healing someone once, and then dying, but repairing 2 gens and escaping *should* be worth a pip. The issue is that the way emblems work make rewarding someone for pulling all their own weight via gens and then living doesn't work because all the categories are equivalent and self contained in final scoring. If, for example, surviving *multiplied* points in other categories in addition to being its own, you can effectively prevent people from just freeloading and not doing much of anything besides hiding, without punishing people for doing gens, the thing they are meant to be doing.
---
As for killers not 'tenderizing the meat' as the Devs used to call it, it really does just come down to the hook being a really shitty reward for winning a chase, because its all or nothing: Either you run the game off that hook due to hook divebombers swarming the hook like flies or you are in reality expected to just hunt down everyone 3 times to get *any* benefit from the hook besides very temporarily taking 1 person off a gen and letting 3 go nuts. All they really need to do to get killers to value new chases more than defending a hook and securing kills is make it so that hooking intrinsically gives you some front loaded tempo advantage (Like slowing your repair speed by 50% and then 75% for first and second hook, which also as a bonus helps make focusing one survivor less common, which is a fair interaction but an unpleasant one that many people find undesirable despite being fair mechanically due to its psychological effects) and suddenly hooking as much as possible as fast as possible becomes really attractive compared to trying to maximize the permanent damage of each hook window via camping.
---
Yeah, indeed it would, altough they would most likely use Sissorsman.
---
By the way according to certain stuff on the net, Saidou/Maxwell was made by the same guy who made Pyramid head, that is why they share some similarities.
---
I don’t call them pistons I call them “Bouncy Things”
---
Ruin and NOED are ok, but Dying Light and Unrelenting are trash.
---
That’s actually my YouTube profile picture.  (Meaning a resident evil and DBD crossover. It was drawn for me)
---
[it’s pretty cool. ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXJShQShYKncd3CLbQo96FQ)
---
Thank you!
---
I’ve been eying Ash, Huntress and Nurse, so hopefully I’ll get more done.
---
Well then its new way of doing this shit prob
---
I actually had a Nea do this for me tonight and I was so happy lol
---
Ash having personality is fine.  I liked Kate's ptb scream and that got changed, yall better not get his voice lines taken away.
---
i will refund
---
I mean... Would you agree if the killer was a camper and the last 1 or 2 survivor's DC?
---
I think is spawns in the random temple wall tiles that spawn around the front of the temple.. im not sure have to double check
---
I just love when i see a myers go tier 3
---
I always check his hand because if its open he has a tombstone add on, if he doesnt his hand is closed, if you look at it and notice it its terrifying
---
Nope but I feel people will be unsatisfied with the changes and drop him. He'll be better just less people will play him I think.
---
These just seem like bad attempts at 360s.
---
When you have nothing else to do, why not try it?
---
Ummm..Thanks OP.
---
Seems more like a fruitless attempt
---
1 generator = 100% 
---
There are 4 pistons
---
100% / 4 = 25% progress for each piston
---
Holy fuck he’s right
---
Constant homoerotic overtones. I can't even tell if people are being serious or not.
---
Played a game earlier where I didn't get gen completion sounds, but it's only happened the once.
---
Agreed, the exhaustion add ons were balanced before exhaustion was changed to not go down while sprinting, maybe make so you got hit with it but the exhaustion effect still goes down while running idk
---
I mean, when I do it, I often fail.
---
But when there's no pallett, no vault near by, and nothing else you might as well try. Maybe you'll get lucky and buy yourself/team a few more seconds.
---
I have only two tiers: best girls huntress and spirit.
---
Then all the other bitches.
---
But I play every killer almost equally tbh
---
I say he was fucking around.
---
I gotta say, plague and spirit are the hottest killers
---
The flashlight.
---
id honestly say make it last like 20-30 secs depending on the add on (minus pigs bc helmets) the add ons are there to stop the survivors from using their exhaustion perks during the chase, and a survivor is going to be running for like 95% of the chase
---
&gt; Again, removing the perk is not free though. Where does the survivor wasted time goes into the equation? To remove the perk the survivor has to cleanse the totems, which is not free, it takes time away from helping someone out of a hook, doing gens, etc.
---
Thus that becomes the 'risk' part for survivors. You have a counter for the perk, removing it is the reward, by not doing so you're risking the effects of it.
---
Whats unusable?
---
But killers have the ability to dodge good survivors, and bully baby survivors, it’s BS. Also as a player who plays killer more than survivor i am totally for this.
---
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be
---
The only thing that makes this even better is you know the hooked claud is gonna stay hooked because of the dude called 'I let Clauds Die'
---
Pretty much but hes kinda right tho noed is a dick move kinda
---
Huntress has already a common add-on which apply exhaustion for 30 seconds.
---
1:20 - Since when the hell has a gen ever been able to spawn in there? I've literally never seen that, not even in footage from after launch and all. Did that used to be a thing?
---
So ruin fine, noed because your new is fine, i recomend getting thrill of the hunt and devour you can run a great hex build but make a point of trapping each one.
---
Many people would disagree with you. It helps for sure but is far from necessary, seeing as how people routinely go for entire matches without it since it gets broken really fast.
---
I've got 2k hours and honestly this game's balance doesn't change whatsoever. The devs don't know the meaning of the word.
---
The game WAS a grind and like most of their events was heavily sided towards survivors.
---
Well, either that or your partner has medical conditions that prevent sex from happening because it would cause them pain. 
---
Also, I do realise you're likely excluding this and only talking about relationships with medically healthy people. 
---
Its just being in this kind of relationship over the last two years has resulted in certain people acting like my wife "trapped" me and treat me like I'm being all heroic because I don't want to cause my wife pain and I don't cheat. It's also not great the frequency her female coworkers seem to go out of their way to make her feel like shit about it.
---
I'm not some hero and she isn't "lucky I don't leave or cheat".... For fucks sakes it's like they think the only reason I'm with her is pussy. How the fuck is that anything but an insult to both of us. 
---
... 
---
I just feel really frustrated at how a lot of women treat my wife because of it and have no real vent... Sorry. I just really needed to say it to someone other than my cat. A dying thread on reddit and a captive audience of one I suppose is better...
---
I'm going to bed...
---
Sorry... Thanks for listening...

It's not even mechanically dumbing yourself down, it's playing the game.  And that's the issue is that you are trying to state that it isn't when playing meta is absolutely going for points. Being intellectually honest would show that to you because every single piece of reward is tied to that.  
---
If you want to rank up don't go for only 4Ks without doing other stuff, if you don't care than go for 4Ks and possibly derank.
---
That’s the point of the power.
---
You will still be looped to oblivion.
---
I can't make a decision on the rework until I get some details, but I'm hopeful.  It would be cool to swap between both but not feasible, then they'd need to add a "pre rework legion" button. A rework should be definitive
---
I enjoyed the concept of HB because it was everything we've wanted in the game, optional objectives for survivors that slow the game down and the chance to get badass looking cosmetics.
---
But then they went and made it so survivor sided that no one played killer making que times long and borderline impossible to get event currency as killer.
---
I love the new legion personally and I hope they only receive add-on buffs.
---
Dwight first stunned the Doctor with Decisive Strike, then the Doctor got stunned by a flashlight and lastly the Doctor got stunned by Head On.
---
/ELI5, please!
---
Okay..?
---
Yeah glad I could share some nice tidbits about Freddy I guess
---
Yep.
---
Its nice facts to know.
---
Holy shit, I was running away from the billy and I ran past a pallet to loop him and then a Claudette appears out of nowhere and drops it
---
Teabagging is good for pissing killers off and giving them tunnel vision.
---
Facecamping is good for throwing the game.
---
Just saying.
---
Personally, even if I wanted to buy it the pass would be a waste as I can't play enough (I can only do a few games a week). It's really unfortunate that I might not be able to aquire certain cosmetics if they don't make them available in the store. I'm not upset at all I just hope they implement it in a thoughtful way
---
"I'm your friend, it's okay, shhh, shhh, it's all right, it's all right..."
---
*silence*
---
"Bitch!!"
---
*stabbity stabbity*
---
They shouldn’t have DC’d.
---
But please take off NOED. Please.
---
Grinding is a good concept and fun BUT when you have RNG based grinding like DBD it becomes stale and boring. When i play a jrpg i love grinding because i can research what i'm going for and i know that i'm going to eventually get what i want.
---
When i grind in DBD it's a crapshoot. I could get to lvl 50 and then spend 10m plus bp and not get the item i want.
---
BHVR would fuck it up and let killers trade powers like back in 2016, please no chainsaw myers. It would be cool though, but ultimately unfair since no other killer can just ignore his rework if the player doesn't like them.
---
Yep I only know them because I watched the remake so damn much that more then half the scenes are burned into my mind plus I like comparing each killers and how much space they take up in the lobby.
---
Nice, instead of arguing the point OP has made you insult them. IF your content is like this i can see why people are starting to turn.
---
Everything's usable lol. If you mean addons, they have to be equipped with the right items.
---
They could do the New Nightmare one, and make different gloves
---
“If you don’t want to get bullied go outside”
---
Yep best move when hatch is available is guess which exit gate killer will think you're at after closing hatch, and go to the other one and wait. Start opening once hatch is closed and hope for the best.
---
*” Eat Cum Faggot”*
---
My 30 year old schizophrenic cousin on disability who’s never been laid does some pretty hard drugs and that’s one of his signature insults.
---
The build deletes itself
---
I assume he means retired event offerings. Though he could also be asking to resell items/offerings/addons you don't want. I would like that feature, sell off these things I don't want for half price
---
Retired event offerings aren't usable, I assume that's what this guy is talking about
---
I mean i dont notice i kind look at addons and just say "eh ....that works.:
---
I don't really care for ranks either way, I just play the game to have fun w/ it and ranks aren't part of that, killing everyone is the fun for me
---
or as a survivor, living &amp; saving/healing my buddies
---
Even then, when you hook the last one that close to the hatch, shut it down real quick for BP on closing the hatch and getting an EGC sacrifice
---
I can't get used to the relation between the time you hold M2 and the blink distance so I just gave up learning her.
---
That's just the cancelling animation, you can't down them with that. Don't try to snipe them, get right on their ass and hold it at 99 percent while you make sure they won't dodge, when you can't possibly miss then let it get to 100 and it'll down them. holding at 99 is called feathering and charging up when right on them is called back-revving (for obvious reasons)
---
Here’s some pointers that I hope will help you!
---
*Do not respect pallets, it wastes your time in a chase and gives them an extra loop, when using m1 killers like Michael and doctor you want to get rid of those pallets efficiently as possible.
---
*keep tabs on which gens are being worked on, make sure you pressure the gens inbetween downing/hooking.
---
*unless you are 3-gen-ing at the end, don’t focus on kicking gens, focus on finding the survivor who was working on said gen, it’s better to kick a close by gen near a hook after you hook em, if at all.
---
*know when to break off a chase, don’t just tunnel down a single survivor if you can’t catch them, you’ll just throw the game.
---
*lastly, look for opportunities to snowball the game, by downing / hooking multiple survivors. the only way to win is to keep survivors off the gen, and if two are hooked and one is being chased, nobody can work on a gen.
---
Happy hunting!!
---
No, but that would actually make the perk pretty cool and a bit more useful. If Thrill of the hunt is the last totem left on the field it will lose all of its effects and instead take on the effects of the last totem to be cleansed.
---
Basically if you were to run ruin and thrill, but ruin got cleansed then the thrill totem would turn into a ruin totem.
---
Freddy main? Glad to meet another cultured individual. Anyway, you don't notice until you realize that you have 500 brown medkits because you don't use them when you have 300 yellow ones. Which you don't use because of the 400 green ones you got when you used to run pharmacy. But you don't run those either because you have 20 some odd purple one's from past item hunts. suddenly you'd realize that you're sitting on millions of wasted bloodpoints that could help you p3 the last few characters even if you only count one kind of item.
---
BBQ just came up in my bloodweb but I’m thinking of maybe using spirit fury because it’s in the shrine
---
This has been around since I was playing and I first played the game in Beta on steam. 
---
I remember some guy politely explaining that people won’t rescue you on the hook if you struggle because they think the killer is face camping.
---
“Im helping!!!”
---
u/ZombieHuggerr you know what to do, friendo.
---
So will most killers, legion is given a free one shot at all times OR The ability to constantly stall the game, Landing that first hit is guaranteed if you’re a good legion. This is not a useless power, it helps quite a bit.
---
Well, we at the least have the Freddy rework
---
No, just doesn't have enough sensitivity to live up to her PC potential. Why spend days of playing perfecting a tough ability only to end up being on the same tier as huntress or billy? at that point just play billy, way simpler.
---
On paper it sounds like a nice counter but in practice it's not reliable. You will not build up enough tokens to counter all of the skill checks you will get. And if you can hit great skill checks, which to me honestly feels easier with ruin, then it's just a waste of a perk because it will actually do nothing for you.
---
*reeeees from a nearby bush*
---
Lol
---
Good because Adept achievements, terrible because being rank 1 is boring asf
---
What region you in? I find most chill games at night time in EU.
---
Shes semi-difficult to play. I use her cause console survivors bully her so I surprise em
---
This man has studied this.
---
This is what i imagen when people say that Freddy is a worse base killer.
---
Don't forget to share some puppL in the chat
---
It stops survivors for 15 secs yea that’s a useful power alright 😒.
---
And that's fine, but don't talk about getting a 4K at all then if you don't give a fuck about BP or rank.  If it's fun for you, do it, but this discussion is largely not about what is "Fun" it is about what you should be rewarded for and 4Ks instantly are not one of those things.
---
[It has already been done, good sir.](https://i.imgur.com/vQ5iV8W.png)
---
As a survivor whenever I see someone get hooked in the basement by a bubba I can't help but fucking laugh. Always have dark sense so I just see his aura standing there, **insidiously**.
---
 Then my team, even if they to have dark sense, still go down there to try and save them, he gets a 3k and I get fucked
---
We don’t deserve such a service, Godspeed
---
Seems reasonable
---
Funny thing is i dont notice. I just load in and say medkit charge addon, speed addon. Tool kit charge addon and socket swivel. Key standard addons. I dont use flaahlights so i have a ton of those.
---
Oh my god the poor doc, all of these stuns were directly applied to the 4head
---
Shes fun to play if you know how to use her. Thats all. And I like her. Shes unique
---
In the higher ranks where people see the same players often survivors could look at the person they are going against sad say, "Oh this guy usually plays doctor. I'll run calm spirit, or oh look this is usually a hag player, timer for urban evasion."
---
Well, I mean... the goal of the killers is to make the survivors suffer. And sacrifice to harvest their hope, yes... but there is significantly less hope in the survivors if they are all wiped out by one killer.
---
It’s not his fault. 
---
It’s how he plays.
---
Yeah, wouldn't it be nice to sell them back at half price? With each bloodweb I'm spending roughly 40,000 to get stuff I don't even want. If I could sell them back for 20,000 that would cut the grind almost in half
---
&gt;!Anyone else think that the whole "Oh crap, he wasn't a paedo after all... wait... yes, he was." aspect was one of the best parts of the Nightmare on Elm Street remake, and added something that was missing from the originals?!&lt;
---
i don't see why they shouldn't be though, considering the goal of the game is to kill people before they can escape
---
the faster they die, the less gens get done, the better you chased, right? shouldn't that mean more points?
---
again, it doesn't really matter to me, but the logic doesn't follow.
---
I've given her a couple tries, never got more than a 2k. As a survivor though, nurses are disgustingly easy to outmaneuver. I've only gone up against one that could manage her flicks, and sure enough she got a 4k real quick. But most either get 1 kill if theyre lucky or just ragequit.
---
Meh i dont really care. The grind is what makes it the grind you gotta do it. I will say if that becomes a thing i still wont care.
---
yep! the worst. her power is boring and no one is slower. i cycle thru every killer from beginning to end except her. i skip her
---
I live in the US (about an hour away from Chicago, just kinda in the middle) and generally speaking if it's a school night (doesn't apply anymore) the toxicity gets worse as more school aged peeps log off and you start to get the "I have no life and play this till 4 AM every day" basement dwellers
---
However early nighttime is usually just a mix of good and bad. Same with anytime on weekends really
---
I mean tweaking Nurse, not other killers :)
---
Take my fucking upvote and leave.
---
Wraith makes the BEST sound when getting stunned.
---
i mean.. i guess?
---
I would I don't agree with what people say but I beleive you should be allowed to freedom of speech. As long as you are not threatening anyone. But I understand that everyone is entitled,to there own opinion.
---
I think we can safely assume this guy wasn't playing. :)
---
Is quite hard to score that low as killer. I think I've only managed 0 points on Wraith... where I found a particularly good hiding spot and just waited to see how long it'd take them to do the gens. Was not long... then I had four pissed-off survivors spending 35mins looking for me.
---
With all the other killers, someone manages to give you a couple of points somehow.
---
I think you were downvoted mostly because of the "fuck off" thing and then it kinda snowballed, but who knows man. You can be downvoted in one post and upvoted in another for the same things. I personally didn't downvoted you
---
There's a ranking system, and there's matchmaking. Two different things.
---
I thought you stayed in the dream world until you got hooked? Reguradless of that he can pull awake people out of lockers so it's safe to say he can interact with survivors in the dying state yet I dont think he can pull you off a gen.
---
It is shown from the survivors point if view
---
I wouldn’t get either. If I can get the teachable by leveling then I wouldn’t buy it in the shrine, but that’s just me.
---
Tbh I think she has 105% on PS4 because it's not that really hard for her to catch up to someone just by gliding
---
They’ve been watching too much no0b3 obvi XD (jokes on me cause I try this every darn time I play.)
---
I got spirit furry enduring isn’t in ?
---
I hope after dedicated servera they would be able to implement 2v8. Infinity V already has that
---
Hes breathing down your neck. It's better than face camping.
---
Toddler body?
---
I mean those points kinda say that end game wasnt active
---
Btw they were addressing their spaghetti code thing in the last dev diary. So I'm kinda optimistic about that
---
I'm the same way, being sorta flip flopping on my opinion. If it does end up just being rework only, I hope the rework has some elements of old Freddy still present, at least.
---
Pair this with bloodwarden and you’ve got a build perfect for letting the endgame collapse get rid of all remaining survivors
---
And this is why: PC master race
---
You do if you are really good with one killer. The first week I had the game I was a rank 12 killer. I still have lvl one killers I dont know how to play.
---
Pig=upvote
---
But that's already tedious. Youve gotta mess around at the start of the season just to get the rank up in order to play some competitive games
---
What problem is this solving?
---
Literally the worst thing you can do as a survivor in this game.  So instead of doing gens and actually be a team player you spam the unhook and BM your teammates?   Someone literally posted a video on here with his teammates doing this and everyone was at a loss for words. 
---
You are so rude for that.
---
/r/theydidthemath
---
This flair needs to be labeled “Shitpost” because this (and lowkey you) is fucked up.
---
Still pissed that he isn’t a killer.
---
I am.
---
Queen Amanda=upvote
---
I don’t agree with the OP’s meme and no one brought up anything about killers or double pipping either. I’m unsure why you’ve attempted to ridicule me about some stance you think I’ve taken but I’m just gonna go ahead and let you feel like a dumbass on that one.
---
That's a super rare add on to have them set themselves. They often end up in not great spots too but you dont want to mess with them because they are already setting.
---
I'm pretty sure you have to get a 4k and double pip but I could be wrong
---
I don't feel like a dumbass at all, just pointing out how dumb your statement was, because it is stupid lol.
---
Uhm. I don' what Amanda porn you watched but mine was worse than Plag.
---
Noed is hard counter to adrenaline. If everyone is hurt, some could use dead hard. If everyone is healthy? You get a surprise attack on someone and nobody with dead hard gets to use it.
---
It's a quick and convenient breakfast alternative!
---
Yeah, that's his point. Killers get pissed when they depip for doing well, and survivors get pissed when they depip for doing well. Then both sides mock the other for being upset. But if you think about it, it's not great game design to punish players for doing what they're supposed to. Hence, no one should be punished for winning the game too fast.
---
But the problem is that if I don't camp, I barely do one kill. They do generators and exit so I have to at least secure 1 kill, sometimes second.
---
Now Spirit gets a free hit because you looked below her waist. 
---
Not saying I would look at her under the waist but hey, a hits a hit.
---
Hmm I’ll have to look into it. In all honesty I didn’t think it was something they could solve and there would always be these game breaking bugs occurring after the big updates, but they could address them faster and have a patch out faster. Coz atm it takes quite a bit and normally their go to response is banning those who play the game and may or may not abuse something that BHVR have full control over
---
That doesn't stop a cat from jumping on your keyboard. :)
---
No point in playing then wouldn’t even get the first generator.😂😂
---
[deleted]
---
He didn't say iridescent though. Isn't there a purple one that heals one health state?
---
Well you have a good evening then. You got me, I guess.
---
yep from billy
---
You're still not considering travel time for a 'safe' self care versus a 'safe' heal. Self care is slightly more efficient there too.
---
You need a double pip and mercilous killer.
---
BBQ and especially Spirit Fury are trash on Hag in terms on game play. BBQ can be at least useful for the blood points bonus, but you should avoid Spirit Fury on her.
---
Oh lol sorry I thought you meant the shrine
---
Spirit Fury from the Shrine and Enduring from Billy.
---
Try her in red ranks without noed lol or even without ruin too which is what most pc nurses do
---
Come on, you know it's [Vol 2, Ch 12, Pg 7]
---
I would expect his weapon to be the fucking pencil
---
Yeah,  it was decently publicised, but I think it's fair if the average player is not aware.
---
What is the origin to the darn thing? Is it specific to DbD?
---
They said he's gonna be more lore friendly now.
---
If that means that people will turn their back to him and be like "You don't exist" to make him disapear, I'm gonna leave the game omg.
---
This is fucking incredible
---
Man blood warden is super OP now. In all honesty, I don't mind. It took them forever to nerf DS so now killers can have the OP perk for a bit
---
That still kinda sounds like Wraith with less control, so there probably willbe a lot more to it.
---
We should be able to sell things for blood points tbh
---
There's a tabletop roleplaying game that emulates slasher movies... And one gamemaster made exactly that - a scenario where the group of hitmans face John Wick as an unstoppable killing machine. Was fun to listen to their podcast.
---
Sounds like you're talking about NOED, which eliminates 4 health states. I'm guessing you're not upset about that perk though...
---
I think the problem with patching stuff faster is how console handles patches, as there are always some kind of certification process. iOS have the same too, so we rarely hotfix things in the game I'm working on
---
Lana Del *Rey
---
You sound like a cool sex haver
---
Ok, it looks like I'm old and my memory failed me. It's not an actual John Wick: "when the gang of 16 villains lands on the island, they will soon learn what it means to cross JACK SHADE, a mullet wearing hero who is more badass than any other man alive"
---
http://actualplay.roleplayingpublicradio.com/2015/03/genre/action/slasher-flick-synthtopia/
---
This... Does put a smile on my face
---
Honestly, I think battle pass is a natural thing nowadays in games-as-service
---
Thank you! But I feel like that's a bit too short? I think 10 or 15 seconds would be fine tbh! Like how Iron Maiden gives exposed for 15 seconds. And although it does require getting out of lockers, it also gives position notification and has no cool down. I think because stunning is so much more common, 15 seconds would be completely fine (5/10/15 for leveling) as long as it did have the cool down. I also completely agree with 60 seconds, but some killer mains may want it to go down based on level like how exhaustion does with sprinting perks.
---
Doesn’t console always get patches later tho? Like I’m talking from PC perspective coz console is fucked they don’t get anything for ages and I can’t say anything more on that coz I don’t play it
---
Well played, sir!
---
NOED would help yeah, but it wouldn't be doing as much since the survivors would be injured without Adren. And no, I think NOED is stupid as well and should be removed as well as Adrenaline.
---
Lol good job though you should look behind in a chase, you could've very easily prevented that near miss chainsaw at the exit gate simply by looking where the killer is.
---
Oooh
---
Just thought I'd share [this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/570520767159336960/573405967799156736/dbdrequest.png) piece I made for a friend based on this scene.
---
I hope not. Besides not being interested in that mode (it would be chaos with the current map sizes) it would also split the playerbase, making matchmaking that much harder.
---
IIRC both the syringe and the septic both deplete the med kit, so using one would delet the other
---
I mean.. they are kids.
---
Except no one is punished, the issue is that the goal isn't explained.  The "Goal" is to rank up, right?  Therefore the point is to draw out the game as long as possible as killer by getting kills, Ruin, etc, and as survivor it's to get out as fast as possible without dying.
---
Nobody is punished for doing good, they just get less rewards for speeding through.
---
Is freddy good?
---
There were several leaks of new killers, a new survivor and both a Freddy and Legion rework with the implementation of the end game collapse. They also tried dedicated servers on the PTB.
---
Leaks
---
- Ghostface is the next killer and seems to have the ability to stalk survivors and crouch. Kind of like an amalgamation of Pig and Myers. A true stealth based killer.
---
- Leaks suggesting new cosmetics for licensed killers as the pig is getting her own new cosmetics based off the other SAW films.
---
Freddy Rework
---
- Finally the Devs have finished the Freddy rework or near enough finished and are likely going to reveal it at the end of this month. 
---
Legion Rework
---
- Legion has been changed to be less annoying and more of a normal killer.
---
- He is now a 115% movement speed killer with Frenzy that last longer. Frenzy can no longer down people as deep wound got buffed significantly and frenzy stun and charge got longer. Mixed reaction to change but personal opinion is that it was a good change.
---
New Survivor
---
- Ash Williams was added as a standalone survivor similar to the Leatherface DLC. His perk Mettle Of Man is getting nerfed due to being very strong against M1 killers. Mixed reactions about the nerf.
---
End Game Collapse
---
- When a exit gate is powered, a timer starts of 3 minutes to force survivors out the match without holding it hostage. Killers can now close the hatch but the hatch will spawn open whenever there is only one survivor. 
---
- Pigs RBT got nerfed for the ECG and Remember me got nerfed. Left Behind numbers got buffed but its even more useless than before
---
Dedicated Servers
---
- PTB tried it out and it was horrible. Having 2 ping checks I.E the survivor and killer kind of doubled the lag. Huntress hatchets could double register a hit meaning one hatchet could down a survivor without add-ons due to lag. Devs working on fixing it.
---
Other announcements
---
- Potential battle pass going to be added into the game. Many people against it
---
- Devs did a survey on popular and unpopular perks plus invited people to participate in monitored matches where all players play with no perks. Devs likely trying to balance the game a bit more and try to see why popular perks are used.
---
I actually found that very unsettling, and not in a fun way.  All i could think about was some Hollywood producer trying to get the audience to sympathize with a toddler fucker
---
Agreed! I've looked at some other feedback and left an edit with a different version of the perk. I'd love to hear your thoughts about One Last Scare 2.0 &lt;3 Hahaha
---
Do a little basement camping of your own if this happens, but don't be a dick about it.
---
Hook a survivor there and entertain them
---
"It'S JuST A GaME"
---
This are neat, but I don't see the BTAS influence
---
Well done
---
 And what killers were added? What do they do? The last one i remember was pig.
---
They already have a add on for that. It basically activates every trap in five minutes. I mean if you put them all where you want them that doesnt solve the original problem of it being time consuming. If they just open when you spawn in at random spots that's not as useful as it could be either. It is better than nothing though. I personally just think if you go from healthy into the dying state whenever you hit a trap that it would make him a top tier killer like Billy.
---
/r/amitheasshole
---
Those Freddy’s perks are big YIKES. Rank 11 btw
---
What the hell was that Adam doing
---
be careful slaty killer mains will downvote you if you say something about the nurse the most unbalanced killer in the game :)
---
unpopular opinion: DS was never OP. Although i am saying this as someone who never used it because i play killer more than i play survivor
---
Kinda like when you accidentally step on a squirrel
---
Noed Bubba is legit bc good survivor never takes the saw hit. Useless power
---
that's why I get 4k in every match I don't even play killer only her I was at rank 10-5.
---
bless you, my good man.
---
These are really solid ideas and I didnt realize how much I wanted this until after this post.
---
You would too if that was your supper :(
---
Seriously though, why do leatherface players camp so much? I've been playing him a lot lately to unlock his perks and because he's fun but I haven't camped and he's still good.
---
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
I was showering and I always think about Pig buffs in the shower. I was like "I GOT IT" and came here. Gonna get dressed now.
---
&gt;there's more to do as a survivor than just escape, so no, it shouldn't be a double pip.
---
Except that's the same for killer, yet we are going to reward them for doing A goal?  The point is that there is more than just killing as killer
---
On that re bit, I specified Nurse because she gets the least chase points in the game because she is constantly breaking LOS and is only in a chase for a handful of seconds, so she should get the exact same reward pinned out for every other killer for getting a 4K which is far easier on her than any other killer in the game.
---
And I'll say again, getting a 4K is trivially easy at most ranks if you run a set of perks for a very certain killer as I've lined out, yet we all know that is not enough to pip for a very clear cut reason.
---
The new rule set just makes so much sense... I cannot believe it's not an existing addon actually.
---
Yeah that was a first for me too
---
I've played for close to 400 hours now and never have met a basement bubba.
---
And they are still in the right.  Quick 4Ks are the worst experience in the game because there is flat out nothing you can do against it.
---
His power is really good for camping, since he can quickly down anyone who tries to go for a rescue.
---
System.out.println(alphabet[1]);
---
Already went there after talking with you. I think there is a chance the devs may see this and consider the change. If my post would lead to Amanda being buffed than I feel like I completed my life goal.
---
I had to take my fucking headset off my head whenever PTB Kate got hooked
---
Considering Ghostface's skin they probably can add whatever they want as long as the rights owners find it acceptable
---
Yeah for sure !
---
Except flashlight Neas. They have a cuckolding fetish and are massive dommes.
---
I run those perks bc there just better OOO! i mean without fail you cant even think about searching a chest without already getting face camped before a single gen is popped
---
Just retired offerings in general. For example the Moon Bouquet addons are retired too.
---
Yeah. They’re just going to abandon the character they spent time and money getting the license to, as well as just ditching the model, animations, sounds and mechanics for that killer, as well as the designs for all his other outfits. Of course they would, it’s only logical, right?
---
If you thought that was hard to tell...
---
Be me : plays as trapper
---
Gets rekt by toxic swf 
---
Plays as nurse  on console
---
Plays as nurse on console
---
i hate when this happens, i think survivors are at there strongest when they all load in at dif locations on the map, if someone can get chased without interrupting a gen thats already 3 gens popped within the time it takes to do 1 gen
---
Played Prayer bead spirit w/ mother daughter ring. Totally annihilating the team. Most knew what they were doing but this Feng.. I don’t know what it was but I could see she was just straight up not having a good time.   I knew right there if all goes south (which I knew it would) she would get hatch.  
---
Find her as the last survivor. You know she sees me. She runs straight in LOS to a corner of the map lmfao. I follow. I continue to follow. Take the hatch!!! I’m thinking.  She is running for her life. Not looping just running.  Normally survivors stop and look at killers like “what do you want from me??” And put a little faith into what’s happening. Nope, not my child feng. 
---
She’s hasn’t stopped once. We even pass the hatch. The whole time I’m thinking “I bet they think they’re breaking my ankles and are a god right now”.   If there was a bloodlust 20 I had it. 
---
Finally decided to just down her and take her to hatch and the audacity to read that I got juked!! Legit tears.
---
It was almost a really interesting way to separate the new cannon from the old and add a new dimension to the character.
---
And then they faked us out and revealed that he really was just a pedo. It would have made new Freddy a unique and interesting take on the character. He would have been a wronged man who had become the monster he was accused of being, as an act of vengeance. Instead it just made new Freddy and the new cannon much grosser. And not in a cool horror way, just in an "I don't want anything to do with this" way.
---
Its tradition, plague cannot be in tier lists. /s
---
Noed and Ruin.
---
A monkey can win this game with noed and ruin (no offense, those perks are just incredibly boring as they make the game so goddamn easy)
---
I like to run these perks and give my teammates gifts.
---
Protection hits are bugged so i wouldn't count on those for stacks, i use BT with WGLF + take a hit to guarantee a stack because most of my teammates are bots.
---
8. It goes faster the more people on it
---
9. No
---
I was really hoping i'd get in :/ I would love some vanilla gameplay, i like going in without perks in regular matches...
---
:(
---
Kinda wish at least one of them grabbed the lid of the hatch and shut it like that, maybe special animations for specific killers like the pig closing it in a “game over” sort of fashion
---
The Trapper sound when he gets stunned is iconic, how dare you :(
---
But the little icon on bar shows the slow icon so im confused
---
Noed Nurse wouldn't be hard on any platform lol.
---
Unless you're the Nurse.
---
I will always upvote Drake and Josh
---
Very twisty
---
A nea did this earlier today I was playing legion on haddonfield but for the love of the entity I could not find hatch so I hooked her and then I see that it was in front of one the house not in the street but the houses yard I felt so bad I really wanted her to get out :(
---
Why insult yourself like that?
---
Nothing happens, you don't unlock any other costume parts I'm afraid 😐
---
Turbo virgin part got me.
---
Yup..it’s embarrassing
---
That’s why I hate playing with pig, I can bring myself to stun her. But then she gives me a sick new gaming headset :D
---
You get an achievement for p3 lvl 50. You can't lose teachable perks, once purchased through the bloodweb it's yours forever.
---
cant u reset or presige at level 50 prestige 3?, i havent gotten there so i dont know
---
What is hags? Literally never play that gremlin
---
ok thxs,
---
thanks a lot for the help man, I really needed it
---
Literally no one said it was an esport. Don't understand how someone saying they don't want to have to mess around in steamroll matches so they can go on to more competitive matches became this meltdown.
---
The Adam must have been so impressed and grateful, love it when you end up with randoms who play like this! Bravo!
---
Bottom tier doesn‘t mean he cannot do well.
---
It doesn‘t even have to mean a character is bad. It just means it is the worst compared to the others.
---
Once you reach P3 level 50 that’s it. You just keep levelling up the bloodweb. You can’t reset or prestige again.
---
Exactly. I couldn’t be arsed to respond to that guy but you did it for me so thanks.
---
*I assure you killer master no gens are bein repaired here*
---
As Nurse you don't get chase points because you are literally teleporting into people too fast to get them, would you like to claim otherwise?  But again, if you face camp you can also get a 2K bare minimum, probably 4K as people kill themselves on hook, so by OP's logic you should also get a pip.
---
The whole point is that the argument that you are "Doing things" by just getting an instant 4K just isn't true.  Similarly you shouldn't get shit for just leaving, doing bare minimum shouldn't get you dick.
---
1. You go down, it doesnt work when BT is active.
---
2. You get the save unhook when the guy on hook is not going down the next 10 seconds after the unhook, the chances that he survives 10 secs are way higher when he has BT apllied.
---
3. dunno
---
4. dunno
---
5. dunno
---
6. YOu are not affected by the doctors shock or static field when you are in a locker, so you cant scream while you in there
---
7. Yes
---
8. Each person on a gen slows the repairspeed by 10%. So 1 Person= 100%, 2 Persons =180%, 3 Persons = 240%, 4 Persons = 280%
---
9. No, but you can Dead Hard over it.
---
10. No
---
11. Dunno
---
Thanks im still curious about grabbing coz most survivors dont want to let go if they are in above 90% like totems.
---
Isnt that kind of stuff,why they want to make servers? Yeah they will try to fix that.  My Internet also spikes sometimes,because of various reasons. Thats why you should never go into a lobby with a ping higher than 120. Also check his ping in lobby,if it spikes sometimes just leave.
---
Why does remind me of Ugandan Knuckles?
---
How about random screams? Hallucinations would appear but i dont know about the screams.
---
Who cares? Battle pass means that f2p players will get free stuff through the free pass and the players that want to pay will give bhvr money so they can keep developing their game. I honestly see no downsides
---
Actually attempting to Kobe off the hook but ending the animation before truly attempting is a sign you're ready to be unhooked and want someone to repeat the same animation (you want someone to pull you off the hook).
---
Flapping your arms (spam clicking as rapidly as possible) is a warning.
---
Honestly you arent obligated to not screw your team over. You cant make exceptions for a dc. You say if you want to give someone the hatch or you are being taken advantage of you should dc. Those are the reasons why I would dc. If I have a purple item and I been sitting on my first hook for long enough that I will die I'll dc. If I get camped or hard tunneled I would too. A simple fix? Stop camping and stop me from losing my item when I die so I dont lose something rare on a one hook match.
---
On [official forums](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/64457/vanilla-gameplay-experiment-e-mails/p2), Peanits confirmed Emails have been sent.
---
Not Queen then gave more details about this Vanilla experiment :
---
That must be bloodlust or you're not taking corners properly, she's definitely 95%.
---
Over a video game it's closer to the same level as long as you're not raging at them or anything like that.
---
...she's balanced.
---
No, only means that someone is near
---
I think you should accept toxic chat sometimes. DBD is sometimes very unfun to play. 
---
Of course when somebody taunts you, do everything what you want, he deserve it.
---
I am survivor main, but i don't respond to negative messages. When is somebody angry i try talk to him a calm him down.
---
I play both at high rank, no salt from me just love to troll those who feel the need to tell me to hang myself after every game haha
---
&gt; breaking gens is related to slowing the progress of gens, which is done  best by preventing people from even touching gens in the first place 
---
Which can be done via multiple perks and without ever having to get a down. But again, you are going off of the assumption that only kills matter which is counter intuitive.  The fastest way I've 4Ked is being a piece of shit and camping hooks as most survivors will kill themselves on it at the thought alone.
---
&gt; using your power is part of tracking and killing people
---
That's not directly true, some powers just exist to end chases, others exist to lock off certain areas, and one's like Freddy's doesn't do shit.
---
&gt; i don't think blocking totems or chests give any pip points, but plz correct me if i'm wrong
---
If you are running a hex perk you don't lose anything when you lose say Ruin, but it's still more efficient to keep Ruin alive as long as physically possible.
---
&gt; pallets are part of chasing and killing people 
---
But if it's faster to kill you won't bother breaking anything because you are literally going to spend most of the game finding and killing people, which goes back to the first problem where you already said that you only value kills.  Following that "Only value kills" logic, you aren't aiming to get them to drop pallets for extra BP on break, or even stopping to kill gens as it is faster to get a 4K where all you do is hunt survivors.
---
And yes, they are different things.  Specifically going over to a gen and breaking it is a distinct action that is separate from going over and hitting the guy in a bush.  Going to a far gen to make sure it doesn't go off is a different action than going to the place where you know they are.  If you only value kills, it is faster to not even bother blocking gens and go only for hooks, and if you are going only for hooks you will baby the hooks you do have because they are extra, free kills when you just down the same guy who keeps getting saved.
---
Related =\\= The same.
---
Because half the time you'll spawn next to Ruin, and the other half Ruin spawns in the open, and the third half (is that three halves?) it spawns in predictable locations that you can memorize.
---
Only one out of every few hundred games is Ruin truly hidden.
---
lol in oce? Dedicated servers? Boy you are dreaming we are the forgotten region no chance. And if your ping spikes get better internet, i havent had a spike in 2 years, not one......In lobby the killers ping is always a solid 60 if it spikes even once i am out because of this bullshit fucking reason, yet even whrn im in the lobby for the full minute and it doesnt spike they will always guaranteed every game go up to at least 120 and its only ever at super vital moments. Feelsgood.
---
Exactly. It was a crutch perk, and I understand the nerf, but it was never OP
---
That's so nice of you!
---
Good job man, perfect games are few and far between!
---
doctor s tier doctor s tier doctor s tier doctor s tier doctor s ti
---
Why would they work for free? You realise that ppl have to model those etc. they don’t just spawn
---
Kill them with fire
---
Well to be fair what would the others do besides a stomp?
---
Killers that 4k often in a good ranking system should rank up quickly (meaning by two pips) so they are put against survivors of equal skill that have a chance of escaping vs them. I’m pretty sure that’s the way it used to be. I don’t know why they bothered making ranking up harder for both roles. All it accomplished was creating longer que times, people still are bitching all the same.
---
How does Head On even work? He was nowhere near the locker..
---
Once u get p3 lvl 50 you cant do anything else. You keep your teachables on other characters, but when u reach p3 lvl 50 you just level up for perks. Nothing else
---
Ash is a hero though
---
Follow da queen
---
Yea but nothing in this game is a skilltest lol. You have dcs all over the place, people who cant run a loop at r4 because they just play 12 hours a day, killers who can brain afk all game and then win with noed/BW. It is all over the place. How the fuck can anybody think they won a 'skilltest' because they got a 4k?!
---
That’s when you know it’s time to farm BS
---
I think you mean you fucbhkglgobjvkbl hklllllllllllllllllll
---
Damn cat!
---
Pizza time
---
*slowly backs up*
---
I don't, unless there it's something I can dispute.
---
I run M&amp;A, A Nurses Calling, Save The Best For Last and either Ruin, Sloppy Butcher or Discordance. Works so well on her.
---
This is America, actually.
---
Nothing. You just recycle your web repeatedly.
---
It absolutely does. 
---
Just so happens in your video the hatch spawned far away from the doors, the survivor must have been waiting near a door already, the doors were far apart and you checked the wrong door first.
---
One time me and my friends were singing the turtle persian song and we both unhooked ourselves still died though.
---
You have to get a Merciless now. Regardless if you 4k or not.
---
No comments about the noed? amazing
---
I don’t care what u/SpikeyBiscuit says about you, I’ll always love you Hag.
---
thats me
---
I've tried doing it right in front of a killer as they're standing in front of the locker, but it doesn't work. Needs practice to use, I guess?
---
for me they didn't even realize so they started buttdancing
---
That’s true, on console I’d put nurse in f lmao
---
Don’t see why the rule matters. If someone gets caught they’ll change their name. I guess there’s the case that someone is posing as someone else, but we have Steam name history for that. At least if we could show names here something might happen, the in game report feature is so bad.
---
Pig is S tier or this is fake.
---
too cute to bang
---
Spirit higher
---
Fine :(
---
Because ruin is usually gone within a minute and greats aren't that hard to land.
---
I mean I am not into corpses
---
Dude, you'd fuck the plague
---
You seen her leather outfit? She is the master in the bedroom not us.
---
The Game is a great survivor map though.
---
Oink not S
---
*Confused oink*
---
the side boob is very intriguing
---
Please, my cat is no amateur, we hit those!!!
---
I just have a rule that I won't basement save against a bubba unless I ABSOLUTELY KNOW they're not near the basement 
---
Still always ends badly though
---
OMG xD
---
But he is saying the right thing, why can't anyone see that? :/
---
Freddy is a pedo, he should be No. too
---
Susie looks like an art hoe and an underaged one too
---
Honestly, if you had of aimed directly at him and the slim chance you hit him with the bottle would have cancelled him opening the door, but yeah EGC is in a weird place
---
She slaps it with her hand
---
Elm Street 2 is low key one of the best. Top half for sure.
---
I have 800 + hours in the game and I've never heard of this "Policy" to thank people for healing.
---
I'm not making excuses, from your description of the "bug" it does sound like a packet loss.
---
Sound improved with 2.7.0, but I have been forced to turn my headset volume up a notch.
---
We have no idea what the power even is right now, I wasn't refering to this speculation, I'm refering to him actually having a power that he has to use with some thought to get good results.
---
I do this aswell,i play killer normally but my rep goes down, so i just jump on 76 and start handing out free stuff lol
---
That’s nothing, you’re just toxic and looking for excuses 😒
---
Well that escalated quickly
---
Rules Set No. 2 is cool. It reminds me of multiple times where I'd complete a generator with a trap on my head when we're crunch time because too many people are going down with not enough gens being done. 
---
It's also fun playing ***ON THE EDGE***
---
Should've thought of it before not thanking for heal. I advocate for manners, by force if necessary.
---
It ain’t THAT deep but okay
---
Shittiest Add-On in the game. But yes I think that's normal
---
Imagine starting a video game and loading into a match just to sit back and do nothing xd
---
Literally everybody does it but I mean, if you don’t I’m not gonna go sandbag you but I am gonna be disappointed 😂😂
---
It is reddit what would you expect
---
My Xbox username is SlightlyXotic in case any DbD officials are around
---
I NEED THIS
---
The only tier list everyone agrees
---
offerings from events\\ moonlight offerings
---
:HyperThonk:
---
event items \\ old offerings
---
Have you tried restarting the game?  
---
It happened to me a little bit ago and restarting worked for me
---
I would just reach out to them through their website. They have helped me in the past with loss of blood points. I logged off after playing for 4 hours and next time I logged on the 4 hours worth of leveling up and everything was just gone. They helped me out greatly.
---
I appreciate that you chose me boi for that
---
Yeah I have, twice.
---
Carefully, he's a hero.
---
A tier list lists characters in an objective order. Nurse is objectively better than other kills.
---
Double pip is merciless. Ruthless is single, brutal is safety and displeased is depip.
---
same T^T
---
Alright il try that
---
DCing on purpose is cancer. 
---
Being it survivor or killer.
---
Calm down
---
The one where he doesn’t kill anyone in their dreams?
---
How does it feel to be wrong
---
Try sending a support ticket then
---
Billy and Spirit are pretty tied in the A tier.
---
I only thank people if they go out of their way to help me with ordinary stuff people dont usually help with. Like blocking a killer when he tunnels me. 
---
I havent seen anyone in a long time at my ranks spam crouching to thank me for heals.
---
The only weak point of the movie is the third act at the party. The rest of it is cool and cemented Freddy as the talkative slasher that would become iconic.
---
5 blink nurse is toxic now? Are we just not supposed to use good addons ever?
---
but survivors don't lose much when killer dcs when all gens done.
---
no ed? whats that lol, take small game.
---
Eh I still do that because it’s harmless and why not? Nothin wrong with a lil thank you xD
---
Sex with ten year old: 
---
Hex: Devour Hope
---
As long as I can hear the terror radius, I'll keep flapping my arms.
---
If this is a list based on speed, it's completely wrong.
---
The real tier list based on list is :
---
1 Nurse ( blink speed )
---
2 Billy ( chainsaw sprint speed )
---
3 Spirit ( phasing speed ) 
---
4 Pig ( Ambush speed )
---
5 Wraith ( cloaked speed )
---
6 Legion ( Frenzy speed )
---
7 Trapper/Wraith/Hillbilly/Shape/Doctor/Cannibal/Nightmare/Pig/Clown/Legion/Plague ( normal speed )
---
8 Hag/Huntress/Spirit ( normal speed )/Doctor ( Treatment Mode speed )/Plague ( holding Purge speed ) 
---
9 Shape ( Evil Within 1 speed )
---
10 Nurse ( normal speed )
---
11 Pig ( crouch speed ).
---
And dailies are always cool. 1 daily per day is certainly not enough if you ask me
---
Did you play when the halloween DLC first came out? DS was definitely way overboard then, especially stacked on top of all the other broken survivor shit at the time.
---
WE need this.
---
I play on pc with a controller lol
---
How creative of them
---
Sniper Elite: Huntress Edition
---
He’s a power bottom.
---
Still potato rank though
---
lol I know, made me chuckle
---
sounds about right XD
---
And BL is good with any exhaustion perk because it has a very useful passive bonus
---
Nah it's you all  that make reddit what it is sometimes.
---
Wraith 2 windstorm addons 3 stacks of Play with your food and NOED is faster than Legion, hell even without addons he's probably faster
---
With the nothing was lost copypasta
---
"Excuse me, R U D E!!!"
---
Same when you start the game with someone and they don't return the Hello-Tbag, but run away :(
---
From my perspective I don’t think I was being rude or dickish. Any new player to any game can admit they were a baby.  We talked even more after this post, it was full of laughs. 
---
The fact that they said “juked yo ass” you can see they were messing around.   No need to make something small into something full of pure hatred.
---
Clown to C and Hag to B.
---
Hag can not be compared to the absolute slam dunk that Nurse does with the hatch.
---
Do you remember how long a reply took
---
you just stop winning. Let like the last 2 escape even if you can hit them. You'll have a lot of fun while your rank slowly creeps closer to 20, where there are worse players, and you can get away with killing without any useful perks. There are a ton of killer perks which offer huge bp bonuses; Beast of prey, thrill of the hunt, distressing, etc. Hooking all of the survivors as much as possible is important too. You get points for kills sure, but you get huge bonuses based on the number of hooks
---
Any instadowns on Nurse are rad
---
You would have been tremendously higher in points, so their argument is pretty invalid.
---
Maybe half a say if that I think.
---
Making DbD F2P when all it has is that lazy off-the-shelf EAC implementation would be positively terrible. And if you just meant "F2P domain" in the sense that DbD would start doing things F2P games do... well, those are things F2P games do for a reason. Buying the game with all its characters (for which many of the supposed Battle Pass cosmetics will be) costs more than an AAA title. Without going into how indeed "greedy" it would be for them to then also request additional money to participate in the game's seasonal activities, just imagine how off-putting this prospect is to anyone potentially interested in picking the game up: there are now the hurdles of the initial base game purchase price, then of the numerous DLCs, then the Battle Pass, and then the grind for perks and items/add-ons that has only gotten more and more extreme. Not to mention that there is the cosmetic store and a potential "Bloodmarket" which could also see more real money microtransactions.
---
I am not opposed to the idea of a "Battle Pass" in itself - it all comes down to how they design them, and after all, it might just be that instead of releasing a Chapter every 3 months, they will release a pass, at a similar price point, and it will include the Chapter content as well as those optional cosmetics acquired through pass missions or whatever. But, having never myself really played a game that had a Battle Pass happen, I am mostly hearing negative things, such as Fortnite's pass system preying on young players similar to how loot systems do, or Apex Legends' pass having turned so many players sour or off of the game that the developers publicy apologized for the pass design, even?
---
Nurse and Legion also have "Fatigue speed"  
---
Huntress has wind-up speed  
---
Bubba and Billy have a different revving speed than their usual 115%  
---
Bubba's "Chainsaw Sprint" has a top speed higher than Wraith's cloaked speed.
---
Shitpost at its finest.
---
This sub is a goldmine for memes lately and i am loving it lmao
---
That's literally the definition of what a dogwhistle is, you take something innocuous and start using it as a symbol within your movement and when people who are against you call it out you can just go "wow look, this crazy person is overreacting at something silly" and it makes people opposing you look insane to people who aren't in the know. Whether or not the OK symbol thing started as a joke, a bunch of actual white supremacists started picking it up unironically and turned it into a dogwhistle. Obviously not every person using the OK symbol is a white supremacist but acting like it's insanity to call it out for what it is when someone uses it intentionally in that way is playing directly into the trap of a dogwhistle.
---
I wish Billy and LF slapped the hatch with their hammers.
---
dwight isnt supposed to be a teen bb
---
The things I would do to Hag oooooweeee 
---
Kidding. Give me Spirit or leave me as a Virgin.
---
And then calling the killer trash tunneler to advert the fault
---
Bubba's top chainsaw speed with both add-ons and 3 stacks of PWYF and NOED is probably faster than Wraith with double windstorm.  
---
Just assume we're going add-on-less and perkless.  
---
Cloaked Wraith is faster than frenzied Legion, however.
---
Wraith is faster than Legion with 1% without add-ons ;-).
---
Killers know what causes DC's but they still do it anyway. They even had to change the ranking system cause new Survivors was stuck at rank 18-20 getting smurfed and camped by killers. I don't think i ever got a DC in almost 3 years of playing Killer.
---
They could make him flicker like spirit. What makes you think if they are possibly changing one thing everything else will stay the same
---
You're right. If someone tbags to greet me or thank me I always tbag back though :)

Worst than vanity mirror? Surely not...

What are these charms that people are talking about?

How dare you put the shrill scream of the legion so low
---
Why is Frank B-tier?
---
What’s the enduring change
---
And no offense but especially Russian players. I don't understand why they are so consistently toxic.
---
I started using the Snipping Tool to take screenshots of what they say, and man they are toxic whether they win or lose.
---
Literally this. I go cry in a corner when that happens.
---
using what have you created such? PS? if so where did you find all the icons

*Circle of killers form around them whilst chanting*
---
Oh no...

Who wants to tell him
---
One of the greatest
---
They probably dc`d because the clown abused the exploit
---
*sad crouch*
---
I'm worried about the "fuc" in the start
---
Devs nerf every good survivor perk to the ground but dont want to touch killer perks. Shaking my head my head.
---
No
---
To be fair, they COULD be thinking your tea bag is a declaration of war and they’re going to be sand bagged. 
---
I thought this for the longest time until I realized the difference between friendly and aggressive tea bags.
---
HAHAHAHA yo guys I was tripping balls on some good weed a couple of days ago playing DbD. And while in the killer lobby waiting for victims I was watching youtube, and suddenly I hear "Groovy.." And I just paused the video and tried to rewind and everything and I was just like "Did I seriously just hear that??"
---
I wish this list was true. On tumblr everyone wants legion to do blood play and knife play and kill them and whatever. Wraith everyone assumes has an invisi-dick or tree dick, and trapper... well okay he’s pretty vanilla. 
---
God I hate that this will be in my comment history.
---
Sometimes I like to just say “ggwp, have a nice day/night! :)” because it catches them off guard when they expect me to say something nasty to them in return.
---
One time I was playing vs.  Trapper, the gens all got done and someone cleansed noed while he was chasing me. Then suddenly I lagged just enough for him to be able to hit me twice. I had 0 lags before that.
---
Enduring + Spirit Fury and Ruin exist so there is no room for iron maiden. If that combo wasn't so good, there would be more iron maiden. Especially if Head On ever becomes good.
---
You are the change we need in this game c:
---
One of my favorite perks :D
---
It had been a while since the last, but I recently faced an insidious leatherface.
---
I'm sorry they want to play the game?
---
Yeah if you know what you're doing then it's range&gt; more blinks.
---
Idk why you got downvoted lol
---
Not to be an asshole, but a 120ms, and even 177 ping is EASILY manageable, you're just looking for reason to bitch at this point
---
lf should be c\\d
---
It is also incredibly buggy.
---
Vanity Mirror is something you bring with perks and other add ons, and map offerings to back it up and it can destroy teams.
---
A random movement speed slow that grants you a short buff, that may never go off during a chase and just cripple your movement around the map that isn't improved by other add ons very well isn't something you can build well for.
---
Really? I never heard of that interpretation!
---
Would explain the communication issues though, haha
---
lol no its not? Literally anything passed 120 and i start to teleport around all over the place. 120 is barely managable, you still get wacked from further than you should and loops have to be done 1 less time due to it but the max that i can do is 120 anything above and i start teleporting.
---
Can you heal an asleep downed survivor? I though you automatically wake them up first since the actions are on the same buttons
---
While it is on behaviors shoulders to put systems in place to discourage this stuff, ultimately you are copping out to avoid gameplay mechanics you don't like or to combat team mates whom you aren't happy with. 
---
Obviously you are fine with that, but DCing because a match doesn't meet your standards in some way is super low class.
---
gimme this killer profile ill blacklist him
---
I am on PC too, but play almost exclusively with a controller for comfort. 
---
Playing the clown and plague is not impossible, but is highly more difficult due to the finicky sensitivity of an analog stick. Even playing nurse with a controller is not impossible.
---
Add that to the fact that it takes about 1 second to turn 360 if you use the max sensitivity, and it is very easy to miss a hit.  You cannot flick and quickly turn after a throw or vomit or blink. That means your mobility is affected after using your power. It is not just about using the power itself. 
---
Even wiggling is worse. When I use a mouse, I can quickly adjust and use the wiggling of the survivor to carry them to the hook faster. On controller, you cannot adjust fast enough and it actually is a detriment. 
---
That is fully on BHVR’s settings, which they recently said they would adjust. 
---
Going back to the original point, there are recent characters and even core mechanics that controllers are fully worse on. BHVR has no issue with that.
---
Then that's a problem on your end. 120 to even 200 sometimes isn't ever an issue for me. Only start teleporting when I'm above 250 🤷
---
in the current conversation where a person brought up killers bitching of dc survivors? yes, of course it matters. if it wasn't for that bitch of a comment i wouldn't express my opinion at all cause i don't care when killers dc when all gens are done but i do care when i don't get my fuckin stack cause pussy got outplayed and rage quitted fucking up their whole team and making me farm with others cause i don't enjoy 3v1 games. and i do think that it is much worse to dc as survivor meaning you deny fun/points/stacks for 4 people who are now either have to dc to quickly move on to another game or fukin suffer. when killer dcs with current condition of all gens being done he denies a small amount of points and everyone is able to just move on to another game. however, when killers dc mid-game denying and even taking away pips, that is shitty and these killers are trash worse than survivors.
---
If you gonna go down anyways why not as well try.
---
Survivors will run towards me to try to avoid shock therapy, so I just switch to punishment mode and hit them lol.
---
This made me laugh out loud in the middle of my exam and almost got me caught, thanks op.
---
I didn't say they should give me everything, i want to earn everything. But the way the game is now it's nearly impossible to do that. I don't want to spend months grinding just so i can gamble what perks the bloodweb gives me. My level 40 nurse still dosen't have bbq tier one. My hag is level 30 and dosent have a single good perk besides her teachables. I'm mad that it's luck based that my effort means anything.
---
Just takes practice :). A good killer can murder anyone with no powers or perks. Just practice your loops and know your map. The long post on this is perfect. Just keep practicing and you’ll become that survivor killers love to hate in no time.
---
No problem. Which exam?
---
I lost! &gt;:(
---
I literally got scared the first time I heard him, I thought devs implemented voice chat
---
I think you underestimate DbD's survivors.
---
These are people who ~~laugh~~ crouch in the face of the demon spirit of a child killer; bully a man who literally wears the faces of his victims;  bounce palettes off the head of a relentless killing machine; shine flashlights in the eyes of actual ghosts; and deliberately hang around longer than needed in the environment created specifically for their demise.
---
Wick would be seeking professional counselling by the time the first gen popped.
---
2 was the first sequel they didn't really care about rules yet. I never said Dream Warriors was bad, but I personally prefer Dream master (it's not a better movie just more memorable) add in the original and these 4 are the better half of the NOES movies since the rest are trash.
---
I've never bothered with DbD porn, I don't think I want to either
---
You sound like one too many Surviviors DCd on you. 
---
Lemme guess you ran the infinite mending Legion?
---
Letting the killer sacrifice your teammate only badly affects you
---
I think good killers avoid tunneling unless you’re in a position where you have to thin the herd. I really try not to but if it’s a full swf and ruin is gone in the first 10 seconds (70% of games) and 2 gens have been rushed down. Imma tunnel someone a little, and if fucking I see 1-2 survivors chasing me trying to make me stop tunneling. Imma tunnel that person the entire game because I know that’s 3 people not doing a gen. It’s just situational. I just think it’s shit to do when you have ruin and 5 gens left. You get more points and pips if the game lasts longer. Let people think they might escape so you can close the hatch in their face and get that 4K in a merciless victory.
---
I thought this said Madam and I was very confused
---
&gt;survivor main salty
---
Guys should I tell him I main Nurse?
---
Not if I escape while or right after he/she does that.
---
Yesterday i made a billy dc because his ruin got destroyed while he was chasing me around the ironworks loop (great idea). Like billy has the best pressure, some people need to start learning how to apply their own pressure
---
I just ignore them. Not worth my time
---
Clever
---
if someone is being chased while you are opening the door. You should wait to see how it he chase end to not fuck up your teamates.
---
If you open the door and leave, they are stuck in there if the killer gets a hook.
---
But clearly, it almost never happen 'cause Killer very rarely use BW anyway.
---
Fog horn would like to have a word with you
---
Nice
---
her* 
---
and Nurse opinions don't matter lol
---
If people would stop falling for it, Bubbas would stop doing it lol. 
---
I don’t even main Bubba, but it’s still funny to watch cocky survivors go for the unhook and get 4k’d.
---
Oh okay
---
But teabagging is for taunting someone. Why would I try to taunt you if you heal me?
---
No shit sherlock this exact thing has been posted for 18 hours straight ever since the video first came out. You are not even close to being the first one to notice.
---
It used to spawn there. It was removed to keep the upstairs Gen and that downstairs Gen from causing unbalanced gameplay advantage for the Killer. The Killer could get some insane Gen trifecta because of it.
---
I mainly blame the awful FOV they put, it’s like I’m playing as a cyclops who has had their eye sprayed by deodorant.
---
I would say bring shadowborn to help you see more than 2cm in front of you
---
I take advantage of this. I play default skin Spirit with Devour Hope. I ended up catching the survivors off guard and soon as that exposed status hit one of them beelined straight for my totem to fail lol.
---
Killers are learning how to get over with 360s
---
Tbagging is multipurpose. It depends on the context what it means.
---
He didn’t have a problem with it and I didn’t have a problem with it. That isn’t why it Happened
---
A quick death can be mercy. I would say brutal killer, not merciless.
---
excuse me? many survivors dc on my ruinless/noedless Pig, on my no fukin perks or add-ons Freddy, on my equally perkless Bubba, on my Rin with nothing too op, on my Trapper with brown add-ons. and in my survivor games these little shits dc with no fukin reason. 
---
and there's no infinite mending Legion anymore. and if i were to abuse the bug, i'd be banned.
---
You’re trying so hard to make yourself sound smart lmao. 
---
So .23 seconds into the match, when you dont know who the killer is and you hear no terror radius, you’re keeping an eye out for a cloaked wraith? I highly doubt it guy.
---
Wireless controllers lol
---
Auto correct
---
Lmao ur very salty rn
---
You don’t have to be an asshole about it. I bet there are people who have already posted it. Does that mean I don’t have the right to post it? Yes. Some people have shit to do in the real world and can’t post things a second after they happen.  Get a grip of yourself.
---
I teabag a piggy when they come say hello
---
That’s fine
---
It was darker and different. It isn’t a good NOES movie but it’s a decent horror
---
The guy that just got hit isn’t in the dream world
---
No, it's really not. Not even close.
---
Because hitting greats is piss easy
---
I'd have to guess but I think they're uglier because of they got burned (or are on a clown) compared to the smoother ones.
---
I just dont know what did she expect, by just staying there carrying you.
---
what way are we specifically talking about here? cause i was speaking generally. it's really unhealthy to have any sort of emotions/feelings towards me cause i'm a bitter and bitchy female. anyone who dislikes me gets rash, anyone who likes me gets trash. better to just ignore like a noisy dog.
---
Pretty sure the clown would have porn of him cutting of fingers and trying to see how many he can fit up hes bum.
---
And probobly some CLOWN XXX DEAD HORSE stuff aswell. so Idk if eybrow raising fits hes tier, should be vanilla.
---
I guess but Billy is deformed and Hag is made of mud.
---
If they do BattlePass, or really get anymore greedy than they already are, I'll stop playing. It's a fun game, but there are other games that are fun, as well.
---
Naaaa that's definitely a nea style. I was actually about to be making a picture of nea wearing em lmao
---
I'm glad Amanda gets to be in the most innocent category she can :)
---
we're truly blessed
---
ds and bt should be S imo
---
ty \^\_\^
---
and a noed on Huntress
---
thanks \^\_\^
---
I like how survivors dc when I blink in front of them with nurse or down them with whatever killer because they tried a stupid play.
---
See, I can also point fingers.
---
Have you seen a no mother sabo squad their horrible constantly destroying hooks and getting themselves off the ground.
---
r/Not-E0S- posted this some time ago
---
Remember those 2 weeks between the Chapter 12 release, and the Ash DLC release?
---
That wonderful time when there wasn't a go-to meta that 90% of Survivors run?
---
I miss it.
---
might as well talk about that NOED
---
Noed vs 3moms, ds, adrenaline. I dont think so
---
Then y ou re doing it wrong.
---
She’s lovely at P3
---
:3
---
i didn't say they shouldn't run any of good perks. i solely said that MoM and Adrenaline are perks that remove momentum and have no actual counter but mori off the hook.
---
Because being a Russian citizen is some difficult, emotionally taxing shit.
---
You gotta be younger then 18 to tea bag in any video game.
---
This is your most toxic game? Well, boy howdy, I need to show you some Friday the 13th!
---
I've seen quite a number of games where grown adults are telling 8 year olds to kill themselves, they're gonna rape their parents, everyone hates them...it's insane.
---
Yeah I’m too old to be tea bag in any video game. Sorry your ego is that small
---
Oh cool!!! Thanks dude!
---
I'm loving the love for OOO
---
Art
---
I should reply back and put that on their steam page lol
---
why should I? You only did it for the points anyway
---
True, I do have a tiny ego. Glad you noticed.
---
Dude, 10 dollars for a texture is highway robbery...especially when you can buy a new killer and survivor for 8.
---
At most, the purple skins should be 5 bucks a pop and they should be some inspirational, unbelievable must have stuff.
---
What I was THINKING is that he is useless until you develop the strategy of seeing the survivors to a point where they cannot see you. The distance can always be changed, small statistics like that are always subject to change.
---
0 altruism perks!
---
Mad Maximilian
---
This is why I dodge lobbies with P3 Claudettes whether I'm killer or survivor
---
You just know they're going to start shit to get themselves killed, then they screw over the entire game
---
how about you realize that you're a waste of life and you should give up
---
Wouldn't that mean the survivors could build completely around the killer. Especially if they main a specific killer, as I do.
---
No he meant that when a trap is on the floor you first have to pick it up and then you can arm it. It takes quite a bit of time to do. What we want is so that instead of picking it up you can just arm it on the spot.
---
I am hopeful that the pass will just be an alternative way of getting the skins and stuff that's been added to the store.
---
Are you talking about the perk or about giving free saves to survivors? I can't tell
---
BTAS?
---
Aren’t you a ray of sunshine? At least I spread my ideas instead of telling people to kill their self
---
Neither if you actually read the comment without being stupid.
---
I wish he didn't have a leather outfit, it should be a black cloth material...

What if they're new? ;)

picasso
---
I don't see Discord icon. Did you drop S+ tier?
---
Hapy cake day
---
well I now know why a lot of scrubs find him hard to play
---
Oh good point. Hmm
---
Does this happen right before the killer hooks you ? Because that's the way it works, once the killer starts the hooking animation, DS won't save you anymore, it's a waste to pop it.
---
Yet there's no Monto/No0b3... soz
---
You still got the 4k man congrats!
---
You can’t refund dlcs, right? Especially not ones like the ones in this game
---
It's Susie. Frank is S
---
Sorry. it was sarcasm, i can see where you missed it though
---
I think you're ignoring just how annoying having to walk everywhere with sprint burst is. A lot of the player based doesn't want to be immersed all game. I personally find stealth gameplay sooo boring and unnecessary
---
Balanced Landing is so good because it has maps(a lot of them) where it just makes any building with two floors or more pretty much an infinite.  
---
It's also good because it allows for really good combinations of loops that include a hill in between them.  
---
If I had to give a list of all the exhaustion perks I'd say that SB and BL are pretty much at the same position(the best), DH would be close after them(as long as you can use it well), then Lithe and lastly, Head On.  
---
Balanced Landing is that good because, on certain maps, it just makes you either untouchable or not worth chasing after.
---
f-first game? with 3 blinks? console? There is a god among us
---
Finally someone who understands
---
One good save is worth 1000 hello teabags.
---
The one dude w/ the hard R wow. It’s just a game
---
You don't *have* to walk everywhere with Sprint Burst.  
---
As annoying SB can be, it's still at the top of exhaustion perks because it lets you go from a completely unsafe area to a pallet, a window or any kind of building; it can save your life, especially against killers like Huntress or Billy.
---
But if you end up running somewhere you're risking not having it for the next chase. I'd rather not use a perk that gets wasted by using a basic game mechanic
---
How is anyone supposed to know the context in a game with no verbal communication?
---
Same.
---
It is a borderline OP perk on maps like Haddonfield or The Game with lots of drop downs, but otherwise I do think it's weak. Most maps dont have a lot of drops like you said, so it is very limited. 
---
Sprint Burst is the worst exhaustion perk in my opinion because it either has to be wasted every time you run to another gen, or you have to walk everywhere which is a monstrous waste of time.
---
Lithe has always been my favorite because windows already give you good distance from the killer so Lithe just amplifies that, it's also the only perk that you often use out of line of sight of the killer so it's the only exhaustion perk that can have the killer lose you. It also coupled really well with other perks like Dance With Me, Quick and Quiet, or Poised, whereas the other exhaustion perks have no synergy.
---
Dead Hard can be good, but often times a good killer will just predict or account for a possible Dead Hard which completely nullifies it. As a killer Dead Hards often get a survivor killed as opposed to giving them distance because they try to get greedy on loops thinking they will trick me with Dead Hard, but honestly it's too predictable.
---
Doubt they care about it now tbh. They’re just busy with other stuff nowadays.
---
With only a 40 second cool-down, you aren't really risking yourself by running. Of course, just constantly running around is a waste of the perk, but in the hands of a good player it is a **very** good perk.
---
Noed ~~Myers~~ is cheese lol
---
FTFY
---
This is all true. That being said, I feel like this emblem *is* inconsistent with the lore, unlike the issue that OP has with 4ks. A lot of survivors (myself included) are guilty of looking at the game after a certain period of time, realizing that at most one gen has been done, and recognizing that means this round is a lost cause. That's the exact opposite mindset of what the entity wants.
---
Happy Friday everybody. See you all on DbD tonight. Stay groovy!
---
100% my boosted ass. 😂
---
Yes, I know because I would always complain about being obsession without any obsession perks and my friend told me that it was cuz he was bringing decisive
---
If it's done after someone heals you, unhooks you or releases you from a trap, it's  a thank you. If you first meet, it's a hello. If he sandbags you ,it's  an f u.
---
All maps have a landing that can activate balanced landing, all of them, the basement stair case can activate it, and balanced landing is always useful as even if you’re exhausted it lowers the recoil of the landing, it’s awesome, it’s a great perk and one of my favorites, don’t underestimate it
---
No because you get face camping killers and your random solo teammates are all waiting to hook save and end up on the hook themselves. Seen many games where they got picked off 1 by 1 after I was facecamped from the start.
---
I can't say that I have my finger on the pulse of neo-nazi's like you do, but do you have some proof?
---
Exactly. It's sheer disappointment in the world, himself, everything.  
---
It's the perfect sound to make when someone slams a pallet into you (that doesn't even affect your health in the slighest and you keep running afterwards anyway)
---
I think the only points he got was from the one chainsaw sprint we heard. We think he might have gotten glitched and stuck somewhere but who knows.
---
I don't know why he has to pick up traps. The entity should just spawn a trap in his hand on a cooldown timer, like every other killer with a cooldown ability.
---
*watermarking dbd memes*
---
Many maps have a place where using Balanced Landing makes you effectively unchaseable. Unlike any of the other exhaustion perks, BL gives you an almost guaranteed escape if you always run to that structure and use it correctly. The killer has to give up on the chase immediately, or they are wasting time. No other exhaustion perk can do that. 
---
That said, I use DH instead, because I don't like humping infinites. People say that BL opens up loops, but it really just forces you to always run to the same ones on any given map, if you want to get use out of it. Predictability can be a bad thing, and it's definitely a boring thing.
---
This whole teabag communication feels like Entity's trials are some sort of 5-9 job and you have to observe an etiquette or be reported to eldritch PR
---
There’s enough watermarks to go around
---
Have fun if the killer finds you right after you use it while running around
---
Averaging 1 DC a game lately. I kind of expect it at this point.
---
im telling you to give up, not kill yourself, but if thats what you want to do then im all for it
---
Welppppp. TIL! I've been doing the thank you tbag but had no idea about the hello tbag. :( I'm so sorry, previous teammates, I'm a nice girl, really!
---
No better feeling than an early chase where the survivor thinks they're looping the shit out of you but you're just entertaining them to get rid of a ton of pallets.
---
You have to work on the way you structure sentences.
---
Small gun joe
---
That's a bit much now innit? Drink some chamomile tea and let's get back to trial grounds chill shall we?
---
It's the only exhaustion perk with 2 properties.
---
As such it can even be used with other exhaustion perks if used correctly. Plus you don't have to walk around like when using Sprint Burst so it's not as annoying.
---
I prolly drank too much coffee yesterday
---
Rank 11's be like:
---
Noed = baby killer. All you crutch perkers come at me. ( killer main btw )
---
She really sounded like a horror victim, New Kate sounds flat imo
---
John Carpenter’s The Thing DLC confirmed.
---
I knew what kind of video this was going to be, and after seeing him ignore the downed Adam to go for the guy that just got smacked off the hook made me excited.
---
It all was foreshadowed ^from previous seasons....
---
&gt;atleast try to fix it asap
---
I want whatever you are smoking.  Only things that get fixed asap are items that affect their bottom line.  Playerbase finds a way to legit way to speed up the grind for event tokens/cosmetics, hot fixed within hours.  Freddy "rework" -  YEARS.
---
not being able to defend gens is something you should get punished for, yes.
---
Lol what a baby. Not your fault he is bad.
---
I have been experiencing this a lot on PS4 at rank 8. I keep running into the same 4 man SWF group in lobbies, which is fine, but I'm sure they are as sick of me as I am of them 😂
---
I don't think it's really about doing as they've done to you, more like if you get completely destroyed in a game you feel the need to prove that you can still do it so you take the most optimal path to victory there is - tryhard Nurse build with ebony mori
---
If you just wait for the game to be finished, you're going to need to get a lot of bloodpoints from that point on.  
---
Instead, you can just spend your BP now, get everyone to P3-50 and go through them 9 bloodwebs at a time, and not get all perks on everyone from scratch.
---
I would prefer to not rank at all thank you very much. Also I think you just got owned and don't admit it. Thanks bye.
---
Sheesh, dude, give him a break lol.
---
A bit of bad question. But what exactly is Gen rushing?
---
My understanding is that it's when the survivors work on the gen all at once or something?
---
Same! I really hope the anniversary event is enjoyable for everyone, I love this game and it's nice to know the devs do too.
---
Franklin's is the only toxic perk in the game. (You can't) CMV.
---
Like the other person said, there's still a chance that they'll find you during that 40 seconds. And a lot of people who play this game like to run a lot. I just don't think it's a top tier exhaustion perk. I see how it's good, but I think balanced landing and dead hard are better (when it works/is used properly)
---
dead hard is way better than balanced landing, everyone knows that
---
Best post on this subreddit
---
It’s because doctor chases last longer than most killers and if your a good survivor they’ll typically get sick of you very quick and want to get you out the way. I’ve ran into more camping doctors than I care to admit
---
"Gen-rushing" exists because survivors don't have another objective to do.  
---
The only reason people complain about it is because they think everyone who completes the gens while they put out no pressure is a "gen-rusher". True gen-rushing is when you don't save your teammates of the hook, don't heal and focus only on finishing generators and getting out even though you have other options that might be more beneficial for your team.
---
It seems like he just played very badly. Not your fault.
---
Your title is correct, it’s just survivors doing the objectives and you failing to stop them.
---
Bro the match lasted 7 minutes and I had gen regressing for a comfortable 6 of those 7 minutes. There is not a lot I can do to chase the survivors if I have to stop every 20 seconds to smack a gen only to have one there team mates come along after me and touch it to stop it from regressing. 
---
Like, I not complaining that they did that, it's there job, but how am I meant to counter that?
---
its something killers say when they dont defend gens and 3 gens pop at once while they're in a 5 minute long chase
---
Yup, the only person not on the same page as everyone else here is owning me you gut it dude
---
https://i.imgur.com/Ydq7YdB.jpg
---
What?? I see this all the time, including at rank 1. Unless the killer is coming, it's pretty common.
---
I feel like there is a story behind this comment
---
Just get the new perks that come out for the survivor/killer that you play most and enjoy.
---
There is not a lot I can do to chase the survivors if I have to stop every 20 seconds to smack a gen only to have one there team mates come along after me and touch it to stop it from regressing. 
---
Like, I not complaining that they did that, it's their job, but how am I meant to counter that?
---
It depends really, some people don't know the difference between rushing gens and normal time for gens to be completd. I consider gen rush when swf comes with all tryhard perks and items to complete the gens as fast as possible normally taking the fun out of the games.... Like, some people play to have fun, and some play to dominate killers and take the fun out of them.
---
What? Since when do people only heal the unhooked for points?
---
just got my first boy that teabgged and nodded his head! quite rare!
---
Rarely do I see a killer run hamgman's trick
---
Getting hit through a pallet while getting a stun is what’s more annoying in this video.
---
Balanced Landing is a very powerful perk on a lot of maps : Haddonfield, Springwood, Red Forest, Ormond, Ironworks of Mysery, Coal Tower, because it makes literal infinites on these maps. 
---
The only map where Balance Landing sucks is Shelter Woods, because there is no hill on that map, the only thing you can use to activate BL besides basement stairs ( let's be honest, nobody wants to activate BL by falling into the basement ) is a tree, but good luck finding that tree on that huge map.
---
I liked the part where you said all you can do is gens and then got NOEDed.
---
Wow... you are so cool with your original comebacks and put downs. P***ks like you are the reason themis games player base is declining
---
Well then you are lost (community)
---
But there is an i in Disconnect.
---
Those are the type of killers who are obsessed with the feeling of getting rank 1. They slug and end the game with 1 or even zero gens getting done. They’re pretty much guaranteed a pip, while even if you 4K, and all the gens get done, you’re gonna black pip.
---
*amused oink*
---
Why block names?
---
kill them, force them to do something that isn't doing generators, i very rarely kick gens because im spending time killing survivors, its just your own fault for being poor at time management and probably bad at the game, too.
---
The only tier list I wanted to see.
---
So gen rushing isnt toxic. In my opinion( just me, my opinion) i dont consider it a thing, i just use the term as they are finishing quickly. But thats why you dont judge people for bringing noed if the game is ending too fast for them. I understand gen rushing in a sense gets the game done fast and you can leave.
---
Thats more or less it, and it's what survivors are meant to do. The complaint I making is that, there really isn't a lot a killer can do to stop them. The killer can't chase all 4 survivors at the same time (unless they play like pure fools) and if they brake away from chases to apply gen pressure, the survivors can easily stop gen regression while Killers have to take work to apply the regression. So there is no real counter for stop the survivours from completing their objective super fast, unless the ruin totem last some fair proportion of the match. 
---
It's not the survivours fault either, they are just doing their job, but the devs should at least make the scoring fair.
---
Honestly I dont play killer(because I'm awful at it)  but it sounds like from your other comments that you should have stopped trying to regress gens as much as you were saying you did and spend more time downing survivors.
---
Though I didnt see the game this is referencing obviously and I'm only going off your comments. So I have very little to go off so take this with a grain of salt.
---
Devs said they have plans for years. It'd be a long wait.
---
&gt;There is not a lot I can do to chase the survivors if I have to stop every 20 seconds to smack a gen only to have one there team mates come along after me and touch it to stop it from regressing.
---
You shouldn't do this... explains why you got destroyed.
---
If a gen is at 99% and you kick it, it will take 180s for it to regress completely. Dropping a chase to kick a gen is never worth it. 
---
So yes, gen rushing isn't a thing and clearly you just need to learn how to play.
---
the play base is increasing, you're just shit at the game
---
It's never too late to become a communicative survivor :)
---
Ruined
---
High quality content
---
You are owning yourself? That's a little odd..
---
Dig that hole
---
Godammit.  But at the same time YAY.
---
4% or deliverance?
---
I try to play pretty much everyone.
---
Not to be mean
---
But this comment thread is completely fucked. 
---
Also Freddy should be on a big fat fucking NO
---
I did tell the killer to bring Ruin. It helps me when I play killer so it might help him too, it slows the survivors down a little and he could get a couple of hooks. He told me a totem is easy to cleanse and it would be useless. At that point, I just didn’t respond.
---
Not chasing the other survivor, camping gens, use surveillance and/or overcharge
---
Survivors when I play Killer be like...
---
Lol, reminds me of that Terraria meme "why do I hear Boss music".
---
i personally  dont like this statue it looks really bad to me
---
Dude... it's literally the survivors' objective to complete gens. Why would they not want to do it in an efficient way? Do you want people to purposely go easy on you so you can have your fun? That's not how any of this works
---
Bing
---
I mean he isnt wrong, but i main freddy almost every game i play is long. Doctor is long because its annoying. Its almost funny killers with good map pressure or abilites that slow down the game are hated the most.
---
Groovy
---
Sooo..... to kill them I have to chase them right? And While I chase one of them, the other 3 are working on gens. So at this stage, I have to commit to the chase to get that first kill early, or let them burn through pallets and break that first chase off earlier to reapply gen pressure. 
---
All the while the other 3 survivors could be working on different gens, a d I have to spend 3 seconds smacking just one (which can be undone but just touching the gen) and I have to find an other survivor to chase. 
---
This isn't sustainable, cause while I have being doing all that 2 gens have popped and I all I have is a few broken pallets and a regressing gen (if I am lucky) 
---
I understand it's the survivors job to do the gens, but Killers need a bit more counter play here or unless they are fully at the mercy of an organised survivor team.
---
Never said that, I just said that using them to vent on people who didn't do anything to you is pretty unfair to them.
---
Those add ons and offerings being op and awful to play against is not player's fault, it's a balance issue.
---
It’s a sprint burst that you can use on your command without being obliged to walk everywhere, you just have to find a certain high that is present in every map, except shelter woods I think. Besides, even when you’re exhausted, the landing stun is still reduced
---
Yep, that's right, that's me, baby!

My main question is

Why the fuck does he have overcharge on

Squat?

All of the Weirds are mentally stunted.

Use the bone clapper and just spend the match sharing your glorious bing bong songs with the survivors.
---
Yeah, writing shit at 10 pm is not the best idea
---
It doesn’t matter how much generators get done I had 4 generators get done and got iridescent in all categories, the match was long just kick gens a lot
---
You two have a got a bit of a bond going!
---
I never play him so that makes sense as to why I have not seen it
---
BING!
---
Maybe
---
I think this has someting to do with the nurse and her fatique state.
---
Best list ever
---
ONLY 5 Survivors have DC’d for you? I kinda envy you tbh. I envy you tbh. I’ve been playing since 2016 and I’ve probably had 100 survivors/killers DC which is really frustrating.
---
:)) &lt;3
---
Really didn’t use the 3 blinks much, would really do the initial one and then maybe a small second, but it being my first I just wanted to have whatever I could as add ons
---
So you're the survivor in the meme
---
Happens randomly to me. I'll fire the game up and I'm down two pips.
---
I'm fine with her sounding like a horror victim but damn not when it blows my ears up
---
With pleasure. So.. its not a perk, then what is it?
---
I can’t play here without noed but I’m trying to learn blinking is kinda tough
---
Really didn’t use the third blink, I just threw it on because I thought I’d be that bad but didn’t really use, did the initial blink then maybe a second one to get the juke moves, fun stuff
---
Imagine having a controller that runs on batteries. This post was made by the PS4 Gang.
---
What is this crouching? I’ve never seen it
---
It's what children do with their food before eating it rather than just eating it numb nuts
---
Carrying your metal lunch pail...
---
Crouch?
---
don’t worry I still upvoted
---
The funniest is part is where they randomly toss them while you 10 feet away from the chase. Easy 4k after that.
---
You are correct, my mistake
---
The only problem I have with that is the range. Small game doesn’t even help that much, and you will still not know how many totems are present. If you search for dull totems the entire game you will most likely lose against any good killers.
---
When I play killer I slow it down by constantly getting people on hooks. Ruin is active. I done someone, put them on a hook and by the time people go for the save I’ve got another person down. That’s how most of my games usually go. 
---
Survivors usually get 3-4 gens done.
---
You only heal people for points? I do it because the more survivors alive, the better chance we have of winning.
---
BONG!
---
not really just takes practice
---
Well that was my point though, at top level gameplay it is difficult for killers to do anything vs survivors. So if an swf go into a game and try to win like depip squad do then they can absolutely decimate killers. Maybe it shouldn't be called "top level" but rather "optimized" gameplay since it is more about looping and knowing the mechanics to kite killers efficiently which is what they do.
---
As for ruin you are 100% correct that not running ruin puts killers at a disadvantage but they can't choose who they verse and I am sure tons of other killers ran ruin in other videos. I also want to note they ran no perks at all which is a much bigger handicap than no ruin because that means no exhaustion perks, no adrenaline and no old decisive strike or old borrowed time which were huge benefits to have at the time and these killers still could not stop them.
---
Winning right now is pretty subjective since safety pips are easier to get and ranking up is harder and requires more than just hooking but back when these videos were made they were based on purely hooks/kills. This means that "winning" for them back then was calculated on whether or not the killer managed to pip/rank up which arguably is the point of playing, to rank up to rank 1. It might not be a universally agreed on concept since dbd isn't really competitive and rank doesn't matter but it is a fair scale for the experiment. Also just to explain it to you back then you needed i think 9 "points" to rank up. you got 1 point for first hook and struggle hook and 2 points for death hook meaning you needed to kill 2 survivors and hook another one once to pip and "win" the game. 
---
Also I knew you were kidding with that comment but I kinda made a claim and didn't back it up so I wanted to show I wasn't pulling my comment out of thin air with unsubstantiated claims. Also I did not say it should be balanced around pro players I just said that with optimized gameplay the games are extremely survivor sided which they are but not many survivors are at that point it is a major minority group. 
---
Overall I was just saying that organized survivors that know what they are supposed to do can make killers pretty miserable. Marth was just proving this by showing how easily they can destroy killers with handicaps added to their gameplay (like no perks). He even talked about tournaments where anyone that didn't play nurse got destroyed. My point was that survivors can learn to play that way and the ability to do that stuff does make the game survivor sided.
---
*Epic reee*
---
Mythocondria
---
Its the snowball effect it just keeps getting worse.  And no ones doing gens and every one is mad.
---
you never got a DC in 3 years? holy shit can i trade lives with you?
---
They have to be used sometime. Sometimes huntress just has iridescent heads, and everyone has to just deal with it. Count to 3 rather than 5 and keep your distance. The players don't know why you're playing particular addons or what your mental state is.
---
You learn something new everyday.
---
Try spamming the crouch attack to growl at them, I'm sure they'll warm up to you right away.
---
I call that move "the offering".
---
thank you for showing me this i didnt know it existed
---
&gt;It doesn’t matter how much generators get done I had 4 generators get done and got iridescent in all categories, the match was long just kick gens a lot
---
Kicking gens is a waste of time...
---
You shouldn't be getting downvoted, you're right that it's a trash rule.
---
Ask the squirrel
---
My personal favorites are plague and spirit
---
Leatherface for BBQ. You also get a half decent killer and two good-ish perks (Franklin's and Knock Out).
---
Not if you want to get points in the category, and guess what if you do it before you start a base with someone chances are it’s gonna regress a whole lot
---
Keep pig. Only pig is needed.

I say hello, by holding crouch and looking straight up.

---
50p for size comparison
---
I'm sorry but you already confirmed that it's not what children do with food before eating it. I already asked you that, remember? So in fact you ARE talking about playing around with survivors and not killing them fast?
---
Coming from someone whos played against that once I can agree
---
Reading comprehension must be tough for you.
---
Hm I disagree
---
imagine complaining about ds. ds is non existent if you don't tunnel.
---
That's using it wrong, if you're not looking for an active Hex specifically you just catch whatever dulls you find while going from gen to gen. Also, about tracking totem count, I'm still a white rank survivor so nobody cleanses but me...
---
Bing bing :D
---
no, they don't, it's simply that you're just shit
---
Fatigue breaks every hour...
---
Why is your ruin blacked out?
---
I had it happen with Trapper and Huntress.

Bong bong mothafucka
---
Lets assume I'm stupid and I cant help it. Your response is not helping. I'm trying here ok?
---
Hag for ruin, even if you don't play her.
---
I don’t even get this post. Your so counterintuitive it doesn’t make sense.
---
Where did I mention them having to know that you are feeling bad? I'm saying that venting on people who did nothing to make you upset is unfair to them.
---
&gt;Count to 3 rather than 5 and keep your distance.
---
I am not discussing balance rn, just venting on other people.
---
He deserved it for tunnelling.
---
I’m 100% sure that the vast majority of EGC (caused by closing the hatch) ends with the killer winning
---
Uh. That’s purple...
---
My internet is expensive which is probably the biggest part of that. i also don't mind getting pallet stunned because it gives a extra 1k points to Survivors and they won't DC if they get alot of bloodpoints.
---
I'm not here to argue with stupid people. Playing with your food is a common expression that is not made up by DBD and you're either stupid or intentionally disingenuous. Either or i'm gonna tell you to fuck off.

“Which killer should I buy” 
---
*you tell him the name of a free killer*
---
Ok
---
Oh yeah i forgot about bbq for a sec, biggest reason I bought leatherface. (Though i also bought them all cause in fairness)
---
Photoshopped, Myers doesn’t kiss girls, only men, men like David.
---
But bbq and chili, leatherface buy for that if not to use him
---
It’s the same as tunnelling, just doing your objective quickly.
---
Gen rushing is when a killer falls to get pressure on suviviors to control and slow the game down.
---
Sure, gen rushing doesn't feel good as a killer. Here's how you can prevent: don't commit to a chase for more than like 45 seconds, otherwise you're giving the survivors what they want. If you can't down them after a palette break/ window blockade, break off and go patrol gens. Try to get as many people injured as possible so they either waste time healing/getting healed, or the next time you see them, you can down them. Plague in particular has a hard time applying pressure- but if you use vile purge properly, you should be able to end chases quickly.
---
Because not gen rushing means more points for both them and the killer. I don't care about surviving, my goal is as much BP as possible. As a killer, I try to help the survivors do the same. If I've been in a bunch of chases, double hooked everybody, I'll just let them go rather than hitting any 3 hooks since it's basically a 20k BP boost to the survivors if I do, while only costing me a little in return.
---
&gt;Not if you want to get points in the category, and guess what if you do it before you start a base with someone chances are it’s gonna regress a whole lot
---
Points in the category? Which category?
---
How do you think Gatekeeper works? I will let you reply before I explain it to you.
---
One ugly motherlover
---
I don't use that. I guess the blood point boost is decent but it seems kinda overrated to me.
---
I've only had a couple of perfect games but they're usually Spirit. She's a babe for them bloodpoints if you play with your food.
---
I alresdy asked you if you meant the perk or the expression. Yes I worded it differently but this is what I meant. You said its neither and then blamed MY reading comprehension. Jackass.
---
Plague and Spirit
---
That's... not a fun way to play. I guess we're just opposites when it comes to DBD. I don't care about points. I care about improving my skill and constantly getting better. I have fun when I'm doing well and win.
---
Also if the killer is good enough, "gen rushing" won't happen. It occurs when the survivors are more skilled than the killer and therefore are able to get their objective done faster.
---
Fuck off
---
In your eyes tunelling is something fine aswell then, right?
---
Good on you man. You main that bubba.
---
What about Juile?
---
Try a friendly M1 boop the next time, it has worked for me :)
---
Slide into your dm's.
---
I know the pain very well
---
Hag is not free on PC
---
Well no plat for me
---
The only hunk in this game. "Daddy" Myers can get in line far behind him.
---
&gt;Game was changed to make it stupid easy for killer  
---
  
---
*laughs in wraith*
---
It depends. If you're literally only going after one person to the point where you're ignoring easier targets or letting the survivors get gens for free than that's just a poor decision and you'll probably end up with one kill to none. But I also don't expect a killer to ignore an injured survivor that's right in front of them
---
As a survivor i like it when we start getting steamrolled. I like feeling the pressure.
---
Sorry but surveillance needs to be higher
---
So in conclusion, you misunderstood what I said and called me out on my bad reading comprehension. Ironic.
---
Before anyone asks I gave up on the game late October last year and have barely played since, this is why the legion and plague perks might seem misplaced due to me having no experience with them... (But still knowing what they do)
---
Urban, ds, lithe and self care. Always gets hatch too.
---
My not getting gates open and kicking generators, is it not?
---
Nah you're just stupid. Whether it's not being able to comprehend simple phrases, or being intentionally disingenuous, you're stupid either way.  
---
Wraith, then Huntress if you've played some fps and can aim. That's what I did before going for more complicated killers
---
Tbag?
---
No. It's like saying escaping should always giving 2 pip to survivors.
---
While they chase one survivor all game.
---
Why is sloppy s tier
---
I dislike sprint burst because you gotta save it. I like dead hard because it lets me miss that swing and make it to a pallet.
---
Discordance is B tier at least, Huntress Lullaby is a bait perk and should be E tier or so
---
Billy has good perks. Enduring less stun time , lightborn no more blinding at pallets and tinker no terror radius when a gen reaches 85% plus his chainsaw gives him insane map pressure and a instadown.
---
Leatherface at D? The way he sprinkles the blood off of his mallet is great, especially because you can add flavoring to a downed survivor that way
---
Yes, it would be awesome, but I feel kind of sorry for the survivors.
---
U didn’t go to work that day, did u.
---
Where's old man Myers from the 2018 movie
---
I only feel sorry for the survivors if it's a 2v3. If there's 2 killers
---

Out of curiosity, do you just watch Ash vs Evil Dead and see a scene and think; “Quality meme content right here” because you post a l o t of ash stuff.
---
Quick and Quiet + Iron Will
---
So many hilarious getaways. Sometimes the killer will just stop chasing me and I think "Why'd they leave me?" when I realize they just lost my scratch marks and can't hear me.
---
Imagine being funny
---
Maybe a few but there like months apart from each other.
---
Wraith and billy are pretty easy to start with. Wraith because survivors can't really get head start on you if you stay cloaked and hide your blurry form. Billy because he can chainsaw dash across the map and find survivors easy, can move quick and chainsaw one hit down.
---
Ok, maybe not for every killer
---
Precisely this. I just rewatched the entire series (still have a few episodes to go), and I take note of any scene that I think will transfer well to a DbD meme. I currently have a folder of over 100 pics 😂
---
She wasn't there in the tier list site for some reason
---
When using M1 hes identical to every other M1 killer. You’ll get looped unless you can pull of some sneaky mindgames.
---
His chainsaw for close range attacks is quite hard to master. There is nothing more frustrating than slamming into a wall after trying to chainsaw a survivor. His chainsaw is much easier to juke than Bubbas chainsaw.
---
Chainsaw mindgames tend to work really well too. Just remember that you’ll have to M1 sometimes.
---
 Hail to the king, baby
---
Honestly, it’s best to use bloodpoint offerings that’s for all categories (Escape Cakes, Streamers, Survivor Puddings) and prestige right away. That’s what I do atleast.
---
I’ve been playing for over 2yrs now and I still have awhile before I P3 50 every survivor and killer. But it’s a good thing, because I have something to work for while I enjoy the game and have fun!
---
U guys must have ALOT of weed..or meth..I’m going with both lol
---
Deliverance, he has the broken status effect
---
You bing the bong twice in succession
---
Oh fuck it's M O U N T A I N O U S W I L L I A M
---
Okay, so you can use decent addons and offerings, but only when you're not already mad about something? How would the survivors even know (or care) about the distinction?
---
I should have wrote assert dominance instead, so if you could just pretend thats the title. Thank
---
Me too! Only survivor though.
---
I don't know, doctor shocking the hatch and it closes, freddy does some cool dream demon shit to close it, nurse closing it like how she breaks gens and pallets, anything
---
Was a meme.
---
Obviously not a funny one.
---
Not very uniquely but a little bit
---
Billy just roll off the tongue.
---
STAND PROUD, BUBBABOY!
---
Thats 12 extra seconds that could be used repairing a gen.
---
The only kind of aggressive T-bag that I know is when somebody fails a skill check. Didn't know there was "declaration of war" T-bags
---
Solo survivors are the heroes of this game. They deal with shitty potato teammates and baby rage from killer players and still keep playing.
---
You teabag to say hello? Why didn't someone tell me? Oh, I've been making an idiot out of myself!
---
Adds a lot of time to the game overall, survivors either heal and waste time or don't heal and are a one hit. Pair it with nurses or thanophobia and it's super strong.
---
Legion for dbd
---
He just sucks
---
I’m thinking Wraith. Since you don’t have to be strategical with his ability, there isn’t too much challenge in him.
---
Wait.. Are you seriously gatekeeping tbagging.
---
My favorite greeting is duck walking in a circle
---
I dunno man, clown yeets pretty good.
---
Pff... Myers can do "\*Bing bong bong bing bong bong bing bong bing\*"\^(EV2) without even moving
---
TL;DR: Killers win at low ranks, Survivors win at high ranks. There are exceptions, but no matter what, current Freddy loses unless he's God at playing Freddy.
---

Idk what gatekeeping is but yeah any time some one tea bags weather cause they just killed me in COD or healed me in DBD I just automatically assume they are younger then 18
---
You were posting Anti camping post yesterday and now talk about how much of a BM twat you are. Realllly shows how smart you are.
---
 Pff... Myers can do \~\~(EV2)\~\~ \*\*Bing bong bong bing bong bong bing bong bing\*\* without even MOVING
---
Legit had this happen to me a couple days ago. Map was pale rose and I was chasing a dwight under the pier. He goes for the window, I get ahead and lunge toward him, but his hitbox appeared to shove me to the left and I smack the window frame.
---
 Pff... Myers can do \~\~EV2\~\~ Bing bong bong bing bong bong bing bong bing without even MOVING
---
why do you main bubba, he’s so boring to play
---
That is true, I apologize
---
Your killer in the prior match may have been responding to similar treatment with that same course of action so as long as you realize you're kinda part of the problem by perpetuating that cycle, then more power to you. Long as you're aware.
---
Damn I've forgotten to do thank you squat but I always do 'hello' squat. Must. It's common sense.
---
watch out we got a badass over here.
---
Its a video game not your life lmao dont treat it like everything
---
And actual Nazis hug each other. 
---
Doesn’t remotely mean hugging is nazi related.
---
Never heard the "rewarding failure" crowd bitch about the old hatch mechanic.
---
You’re the plague and have one of the best anti gen rushing abilities.  Also kicking gens is very effective to gain those points
---
Wraith hits you with that thumbs up when he wipes the blood off, it's like "ayyy nice one"
---
If you start with nurse then you can learn her easier and she is the most powerful killer, it is a very big learning curve though
---
I did this once while using Ruin + Thrill of the Hunt + Distressing + Unnerving Presence / Bone Clapper + The Beast (terror radius while cloaked) &amp; a Game offering to passively slow the game down as much as possible.
---
I spent the entire game bing bonging survivor's while watching them fail small skillchecks.
---
"WAKE UP FROM THIS, BITCH!"
---
His drawings and the class photo add ons are all references to the movie. Nancy grows up to draw and the class photo is seen in a flashback.
---
I will never get tired of the wraith and his angry elephant stun noise.
---
That's adorable, I love it :,)
---
Exactly!
---
It happens in a lot of places. Are you angling for the near edge of an open gate? One of the small one-character-wide bridges in Yamaoka Estate? On one of the boats in the Swamp?
---
Survivors can shove me **far** to the side midlunge by just ramming me into like this is bumper cars, causing me to miss not only my target, but everything.
---
It's worse when a survivor who is beside you causes you to keep 'bumping' into them and forcing you to their speed so you can't lunge and hit an injured survivor, but worse; because that injured survivor actually outruns you then (even though even if a survivor who is running is bodyblocking you, it shouldn't slow you down that much).
---
You can't 'go around' a survivor, because of their priority; killer should always have collision priority and force survivors away from their path (to the side, not giving them a speed boost in front).
---
Enduring is only going to affect pallet stuns. Not head on or decisive strike.
---
Still wouldn't recommend Huntress unless you REALLY REALLY like her style.
---
I'm a long time FPS player, and she is much more prediction/projectile based rather than aim based. There are very rare instances where twitch/reactive aiming help, and she gets screwed over by hitboxes a lot.
---
I would recommend Bubba to start, simply because the sooner you get BBQ the better your leveling will be in the long term. Afterwards, Hag would be 2nd best simply for her easy playstyle at low ranks and because Ruin will tremendously help you.
---
For Hag, all you need to do is trap your Ruin, trap strong loops during a chase to force them away, and always trap the hook. She's all about constant pressure which snowballs.
---
Again as I've said, if you know what you are doing then range will benefit you more than extra blinks.
---
If you are not an experienced player, more blinks will suit you better.
---
If you're a good nurse then you really won't need much adjustments. Extra range on blinks allows you to just blink to the last place where they broke the line of sight and get to them with the 2nd blink.
---
Dude... unrelenting?
---
You say literally, literally too much. We get it. Omega Nurse triggers you. I think her addons need to be adjusted (downsides for range addons and no bonus chain blinks) and she would be fine. Let the circlejerk re-commence.
---
With a controller maybe. 
---
You can actually play nurse like a no-chargebar spirit only jumping short distances and still get kills. Not 4k’s, but easy 2k’s. 
---
Nurse is broke.
---
Should have let the poor dwights live
---
This. That’s when I look at the survivors because now they’re encouraging camping because their thought process is akin to a newborn kitten.
---
It is very unbiased in that respect. If killers rely on camping yo get kills then they deserve to be in the rubbish ranks anyway. Don’t experience much camping myself but usually it happens because of me being toxic. It’s annoying that killers can dictate the game the way they do. ;)
---
As a survivor main, we T-bag to each other for quick communication:
---
T-bag at the beginning = hey! How it’s going ;)
---
T-bag when you or teammates injured = heal me u creature!!
---
T-bag when missing skill check = oops! Sorry!
---
T-bag after being saved or healed = thx, gl dud
---
T-bag after reaching the exit gate = Ay, u made it :)
---
However. T-bag when other survivor is downed is bad manner, don’t do it!
---
Is that a Cannibal outfit? Or a Dwight outfit? Is this from Dwight to Dwight?
---
Lucky you then :D
---
Are you not understand basic reading comprehension? I was not involved in this clip. This clip is from TWO days ago. A WEEK ago he invited me to a party after a match and was yelling and raging at me for killing him because he thinks I played unfair. This clip was TWO days ago where he was playing with my friend and was talking about me to HER.
---
I had two people going at the other night using each other's real names (which werent their steam names)
---
WTF, Paul?!  You spent the whole game crouching around the map not doing gens!
---
WTF, Steve?! Everytime I touched a gen she was on me!
---
So you are never going to touch a gen again?!
---
FUCK YOU, Steve!
---
Amazing...
---
I had to break it down for you since you can’t comprehend the first reply I made to you.
---
Pretty good job so far. ;)
---
I found the hex totem.
---
Yeah, that’s cool and all, but I like my achievements to be possible
---
&gt;Save
---
She isnt broken and if you put time and master her you can get 4k.
---
Shrutes Demise: Your vicious humour makes the Redditor drop their upvote on impact.
---
Why
---
Well good survivors can dictate the game as well with proper gen management. I’m telling you, 99% of survivors don’t even understand gen management. That is really frustrating as well because you essentially end up screwing your team over because you wanted to be a pansy and pop the gen all the way out in Africa, and now the final gens are in a conga line and you’re out of luck. :I
---
There's only one generator remaining and nobody is dead. I'd be more sympathetic to you if your match had just started.
---
Yeah. If you get bad survivors then that can be as bad as a camping killer. ;)
---
You are really adamant on ignoring the fact that I've said twice now that you can use them whenever you want and I don't think there is any situation where it's toxic or inappropriate to use them.
---
I think that  venting on players who are not the ones that got you angry is unfair to those players. If you get stomped in one match and are annoyed at those survivors, taking your anger out on a new batch of survivors that aren't the ones that got you angry is unfair to those people.
---
I have let some new people play the game for the first time and at first they run to find the next person away from the hook. After the second or third immediate unhook, they start camping. 
---
With the new people, it doesn’t help that they get circled around pallets and teabagged or pointed at to make them mad. That just adds to the “sit and watch die” attitude.
---
One of the worst legacy Nurse’s representing! 💪
---
My bad for not playing her for a solid year, I’m so rusty!
---
Long live the legacy of Dwight!
---
Lol he had no ruin 😂
---
Probably giving away codes for auric cells and exclusives
---
"We did it boys, toxicity is no more"
---
lady's and gentlemen we got a genius
---
What? Best anti rush ability?  
---
Most people just work through the sickness I have seen. Using Plague, Legion, Nurse, or using a Mori is the easiest way to make people gen rush.
---
Just do what the survivors say to the killer: Break chase and find a different killer to chase you.
---
What does it matter? I’m spreading the truth
---
Yees
---
BUBBANESE
---
Hillbilly sortoff aswell
---
There's a reason survivor queues are so long. Nobody wants to play killer anymore just to get flamed after the match for not following the latest survivor ruleset.
---
Check to see if the game files are still there, and if any other games also appear as uninstalled. Sometimes steam misplaces the directory it's supposed to take data from.
---
That wasn't a reason. That was just another way of calling someone dumb without saying why. Yes this discussion is not fruitful because you are a dishonest jackass. Am I being too hard on you? Life treating you hard?
---
welcome to the shitshow known as the internet XD
---
Run Corrupt Intervention, people will avoid trying to be sick for the longest and if you have only 5 gens to cover its a lot more difficult.  Pray that people cleanse and you’ll be set
---
Id say swap bitter for ruin and thats pretty much it. If you dont want noed you can switch it with another endgame perk.
---
Just checked. Everything is gone, am downloading the whole game again
---
That would actually make rule No.2 useful! Imagine either they look for boxes they can’t see slowly, acting like a built in ruin, or they do a gen and they all start the timer. It would be so cool to see in game, actually, as survivors frantically rush to get them off their heads at the same time
---
Yeah I tried ruin but it just gets popped in the first minute everytime
---
Even in exhaustion, you still get a reduced landing stun. This can save your but so many times. It is like a mini-boost. It can’t really be countered as a killer if a survivor positions them self in advance. 
---
Couple it with Spine Chill and you know when to position yourself near a drop. You can avoid a killer a good bit with those two
---
I can't tell the difference.
---
*gags*
---
The emblem system rewards are fucked for sure, we can all agree on that.  I do give the devs credit however for both attempting to incentivize killers not to camp and survivors to work together.  They haven’t gotten it perfect yet, but I’m glad they’re at least trying to make the players try harder.
---
I dont have legacy, but i have a B L E N D E T T E though :)
---
Why? He's probably one of the best DbD players out there
---
Interesting idea, but it would be kind of pointless since survivors would remove the helmets before they were activated. Maybe survivors shouldn’t be able to interact with the boxes until certain requirements are met.
---
thx.
---
Bug: In game.
---
Reproduced: 100 %
---
Fast vaulting the side window on the bus (auto haven) doesn’t work.
---
I mean yeah you can try those builds, but if you’re playing to win then it’s a hard sell of those perks over meta ones. Why play a unbreakable/tenacity/flip flop build that only works once every ten games when you can just use adrenaline or borrowed time, which almost always have an impact on the game.
---
This was great. Thanks for the laugh.
---
&gt; if you're playing to win
---
Therein lies the problem.
---
yes
---
Please someone make it so when billy charges you can hear tyler1 car “noises” I need that in my life
---
I'm still new to the game, could someone make a list of the proper procedures and etiquette as a survivor?
---
or most killers
---
Then run thrill instead of noed or sloppy.
---
How the turntables
---
Its the reason I'm done talking to you about it. Fuck off moron
---
Nurse need a buff
---
Yeah Franklin's is real nice. I just like other perks more than BBQ, it seems kinda overused
---
Definitely in the same family, bud.
---
Insta blinds was removed like 1 year ago tho. But ye i feel u
---
You heal them before waking them up if they're slugged.
---
Then why are you talking?
---
It's in the 3rd year anniversary trailer in YouTube.
---
The point would be to slow gen speed down, and it would also make it easy to find your first survivor by just patroling the boxes. Could be a bit too powerful even.
---
It IS anti-camp.
---
Staying in an area to defend a hook against survivors who are attempting to swarm it? That's not camping.
---
Camping is not caring where the other survivors are, not what they're doing, just on the possibility that someone might get unhooked or in order to catch someone who may try, but not actually knowing whether anyone is or might be.
---
Throwing someone onto a hook and not seeing a single aura from BBQ? You're not camping the hook, the survivors are, you're just trying to find them.
---
Hooks still do hex totem noises.
---
At least they still have a chance to play the game, get a few points or hooks here and there. I’d rather that than wait for a lobby and load a game to not play or DC because someone wants to be a cunt.
---
Even if I know they don't got a tombstone, I still don't risk it with Myers.
---
True, but the grind is real. The points help. I would actually like to see WGLF and BBQ point gains be a default part of the game. Then those two perks can be freed from constant use.
---
To disastisfy that "gotta have the last word" feeling redditards oh so crave. Better question would be why are you still replying this isn't going anywhere. But I know why as stated above.
---
That's the most boring and least interactive thing one could have come up with and you did it
---
I’m sorry, but you’re wrong. Facecamping is done by bad killers to ensure they get a kill. Tryharding with add-ons/perks as a killer is the same thing as tryharding with flashlights/SWF voice chat as a survivor - it’s just playing the game competitively and optimally. I say this as a survivor main.
---
That would be rad. Then I could use my four fave perks without having to worry about BP loss!
---
Oh yes
---
I already addressed this point in the same thread.
---
Yes but it is the most likely outside of the game. 
---
In the game we will probably get community challenge.
---
Yeah, it seems pretty lazy (to me) to just make it part of an existing realm and re-using more than 50% of the textures you already have...
---
Look at maps like Haddonfield and Lèry's. Those are original maps with new, fresh textures. Not re-used crap.
---
I think this would be neat, maybe as a rare or very rare addon. Might be a bit too much if it was default, but as an addon, it could be a great way to slow beginning game gen speed
---
Yeah, I would love to have a legacy 3 Nurse, but I know it will never happen.
---
Which is fine by me. Legacy skins were a one time deal.
---
1. Its a shitpost, 2. Someone else did a tier list based on who bing bongs or not. Not all tier lists are super serious
---
The only thing that annoys me about camping is when people don't do it tactfully.
---
If you slap the first survivor on the hook and stand there, you are announcing to the others they can safely do gens because you're not going over there. Low ranks you are rewarded for doing this because the survivor on the hook usually gets mad and dcs or struggledies. Only thing is if you do this to obviously bad survivors, you would have been able to kill them regardless.
---
If a team is tough, a good timed camp can turn a game. I would never camp the first person I got, but if the game went on and the survivors see I leave the hook each time, they are going to go for the save more and ignore the gens more to get the fat WGLF stack. Then all I have to do is hunker down on a struggling survivor to surprise the team. The old bait and switch works, and it always surprises me as a survivor too when a killer who was going away from the hook each time does a 180 unexpectedly and returns to hook to intercept a save that was thought to be safe cause boys he ain't a camper.
---
Also...if you have the next to last guy on the hook and there is enough gens done for the hatch, why would you camp that guy instead of either find the hatch, the last survivor, or get far away enough to encourage a save and find the last guy? I don't get mad at a killer, I just question his decisions when I feel like I could have made it work better in his shoes.
---
If you are talking Perks, then yes she has a good one, but I was just talking about ability. Perks can be run on any killer. 
---
In my experience, I have not seen good survivors heal.  They just gen rush on Plague. They heal at the end, before opening the gates. If getting sick did something else like slow down gen progress, that would change things. Right now, though, I rarely see people cleansing, either when I play survivor or killer.
---
Platform: PC
---
Type of Bug: In-game
---
Description: I lose my offering as the killer when a different player disconnects and the game returns to the menu. Why do I lose my offering? I thought this was fixed with 2.7?
---
Those games are pretty rare.  
---
I doubt anyone has fun in those kinds of games.
---
And the animation doesn't even happen until shes been given the chance to do a full on lunge (most of which will physically miss me by several feet and I'll still take damage from her deceptively long blade)
---
very interesting idea! The entire mechanic would probably have to be changed. I like when the characters feel true to their license. Pig sorta feels like the amanda from the saw movies but sometimes i think there are changes that can be made
---
plaform ps4
---
type of bug audio
---
discription sometimes when someone gets hooked and killed the sound overlapped and kept going over again its really annoying happened to me once
---
3 toolboxes and a BNP, 3 gens pop in a minute. What can a 110 killer do in that case? Do they ignore any survivors they see in the beginning of the game who aren’t on gens?
---
That is like saying to a survivor, just don’t get tunneled.
---
Well, obviously they'd need to punish the person who DC's as well so that it's not as easy to exploit. There'd also need to be some sort of time or progress limit on when a DC would result in a ward. If it's in EGC and they DC to avoid getting clapped by the entity, obviously there'd be no ward for anyone. It's not a perfect solution by any means, but I think it would help with a lot of toxicity issues centered around DC's.
---
None of this is to "bitch" about the nurse per se but I'm just pointing out that she flat out does not work properly and I suspect her range that extends far beyond her in game visible reach isnt intentional
---
I had so much hope...the entity feasts again:(
---
I have a Legacy 3 Nurse.
---
We did just get a new Survivor only update (Ash Williams), so it does make a bit of sense we'd see a Killer only update right after.
---
Aah, I chuckled quite loud while I am in a metro at 2 am
---
Vanity mirror is the T2 one that slows you and only gives 16m vision, along with the medium terror radius.
---
Lmao ikr gottem survivor idiots lol theyre op anyway noed is mandatory smh 😪😪😂😂😂😂👌👌
---
Yeah, honestly to keep their consistency straight they should call it a Paragraph rather than a Chapter since they've stated *numerous* amount of times that a **Chapter includes a Killer, Survivor and Map**. 
---
Oh well.
---
Not really... I don't play for "Fancy Rainbow outfits" And if I did I wouldn't be playing this game for em'.
---
So if that sounded stupid to you, you really must love Fortnite..
---
I only play the game for Mechanics and fun scenarios.
---
Plus...
---
vvvv
---
Why we don't need a battlepass:
---
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D7NnCnCVUAIfVXG.png
---
So if you want to spend an extra $15 to reach that $200 threshold go ahead waste your money. 
---
Cause, If you can earn skins by shards for leveling up and since there isn't a Level cap..
---
You can get the skins in the so called Battlepass for...
---
You guessed it...
---
FREE by just playing the dang game.
---
But, if you want to call me stupid then go ahead.
---
All I said is buying some crap for only skins for $15 is stupid in which i stated:
---
"Cosmetics make me NOT want to play the game"
---
Because it's true, and your opinion doesn't matter if I stated my own opinion.
---
So go try and be toxic somewhere else pal.
---
I think trapper is the best starter killer, he's so simple just place some traps in nice spots and work on your chases and stuff
---
Screenshot, send to someone, open PS app, open messages, save image on phone, post on Reddit. Aka the long way.
---
You made me think about something interesting. I think people deem winning as getting a kill. Whether they made it fun or not. But if 4 survivors escape but they were hooked twice each is that REALLY a loss? The argument i always find myself having with people is fun vs winning. Some people don't know how to do both but when you put it like this, is winning only tied to kills? I mean you know a loss when you suffer one but i think you can still call it a win with 0 kills. 
---
I have a feeling few people will agree with me on this cuz yall are fiends but I'm very adamant about this community being more positive and having fun while allowing the other side to also have fun. Idk i appreciate the spark of thought
---
thank you sir.
---
Do you have a moment to talk about our lord and savior Amanda?
---
No. As I stated, it was my opinion. I don't think they look that good
---
legion
---
I think 3 new map offerings won't hurt considering there are like 6-8 good perks for each killer out of 70 ish. It's laziness
---
Im using it to counter noed. If people didn't use adrenaline i would not be using noed
---
I was in the war with you comrade against the devs about the nerfs, of course I have time for Amanda and you.
---
That is gen rushing though. There is nothing you can do to stop it in that case (Unless you are Nurse or bring a red Mori)
---
It happens, and pretty frequently since the rank emblem changes. Get people with multiple toolboxes, maps, and BNP SWF teams at least every 2 or 3 matches. That is pretty frequent to me. That includes me playing as solo survivor and seeing 2-3 SWF teams.
---
Well if you have yet to see it I would like your opinion in these changes I suggested:
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bsdw2r/i\_think\_i\_got\_it\_i\_got\_the\_best\_buffschanges\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bsdw2r/i_think_i_got_it_i_got_the_best_buffschanges_for/)
---
Nah. 
---
Survivors can just dive the hook and force the killer to stay because he is worried about overly altruistic survivors. 
---
Camping is only a problem for the camped, if you're team is organised you can very easily counter camping, in addition it is not advantageous for the killer since they will end up loosing other survivors, points, gen progress etc.
---
Plague yeets the nasty
---
Bing Bong Mufucka
---
I honestly think she needs a rework, but not enough people see Nurses at lower ranks to complain about it. It is so easy to stay at higher ranks with her that the majority of the player base that play casually don’t see many of them.
---
I've been playing on my alt because queues have been shit; I might get to see those SWF groups, then.
---
Why do you care what anyone else thinks?
---
I know, that’s because it’s so obviously a good idea. I just want discuss “why not”
---
Myers or Spirit
---
Really, the pig has gone under appreciated for a long time, she needs some love too
---
BuFf the pig people
---
BUFF THE PIG FOR GOD'S SAKE
---
That Dwight is laying the funk
---
You're not hitting a person, you're minorly inconveniencing them
---
Who eats lunch between 5-9?
---
Oh , i thought it was like more objectives , oh well .
---
I can't think of a right way to do the battle pass , will every survivor get a set ? A piece ?
---
&gt; some of her add-ons are problematic 
---
I'm not very good with Nurse. I 4k'd people on the swamp with the bookmark and the matchbox add-ons (basically +1 blink for slightly longer fatigue and a bit shorter blinks). Two blink Nurse can be kinda hard, but even adding one more makes it so much easier to hit survivors.
---
Dying Light is really strong by itself if done correctly.  
---
You should use game-delay(like Ruin/Sloppy/Corrupt Intervention) or perks that help you in a chase instead.
---
No need to act like an asshole when we're just talking about a video game okay? 
---
What I'm saying is that while yeah it doesn't force you, it's a pretty much a locked purchase like a gym membership or the shitty practice mobile games do with the "daily login" schemes. If you pay 5 dollars for the membership for the auric cells, it makes you grind the game constantly in order to win back the auric cells you spent for buying it so you will be able to buy it next season.
---
It locks you in seeing how you if you dont play long enough to grind back those auric cells, youd have to spend another 5 dollars to get the battle pass the next season. Dead By Daylight is an arcade style game, if I want to play it I want to play it for fun. 
---
Fortnite is free so they need practices like this to earn their money, fair enough. Dead By Daylight is a paid game in which you can buy things from the store if you want, not having the costumes locked behind limited battlepass subscriptions.
---
I'm talking solely endgame
---
Nice. Enjoy the rest of your games dying on first hook
---
Oh lord, when someone fails a skill check - especially with no Ruin/Lullaby/Madness - I just crouch right up next to them and look up.
---
Proceeds to keep blocking as a punishment...
---
No, this is Patrick.
---
You could just use Trapper with Iridescent Stone on top of that then.  
---
Should be pretty strong.
---
Lol nah I just play slightly more immersed after letting everyone know not to save me. 3/5 games I get to escape alone.
---
Dayum, the list is literally perfect. Wouldnt change a single killer. Props op.
---
Survivors diving the hook are survivors not doing gens, getting hit, and otherwise benefitting the killer. 
---
Killers get baited constantly, we get baited to infinites, away from gens etc... it’s just a part of the game you have to learn as a killer.
---
Killers who camp don’t care about scoring points, they’re noobs, toxic, dumb, or just getting daily’s. 
---
TrueTalent said they should implement this on his stream. A guy who is notoriously preaches how weak killers are.
---
This dream demon puts you to sleep for good
---
&gt;I know, that’s because it’s so obviously a good idea. I just want discuss “why not”
---
I'm sure you can find these reasons in the other threads just as easy...
---
When I'm linked to a nice fellow survivor, I sometimes meme around and they'll do the same, which is pleasant because even if we die, we made the game at least fun.
---
Freddy yeets his lunge 3 feet beyond where his claws are
---
Update this when Ghostface comes out
---
Trapper with Dying light, Remember me, Noed, and nurses. Addons would be iridescent stone and bloody coil (or whatever causes them to get injured when disarming)
---
Anyone who can't bing bong is a FOOL and must be regarded as such
---
I mean there are technically 27 different maps with 12 realms/map offerings. With 6 of those offerings being for a single map. Where does the number 3 come from in new map offerings, it would 15 new map offerings if each map got one, which is a lot.
---
If I'm not mistaken each map used to have 3 separate map offerings which people loved when they got rid of em to reduce the bloodweb clutter.
---
I'm all for making maps more distinct, which I think they did a decent job with just because they used similar assets doesn't make it lazy, the example given Temple of Purgation has it's own unique loops and tiles in it still and an entirely unique setpiece like any other map. Just giving it it's own realm won't exactly what makes it standout from others.
---
&gt;No need to act like an asshole
---
I didn't. But the fact that you think I did, makes me realize I totally hit the mark with that comment. 
---
&gt;like a gym membership
---
Again, no. You need a Gym membership to be able to use the gym. You don't need the battlepass to play the game. This is more like some very exotic gym course that will cost you extra, aside of your membership. No one will force you to take it, but well again, "you could miss out"...
---
I will. I promise you that I can't wait to use him
---
These have been getting so lazy lately.
---
It wasn't an obsession perk and it had no activation requirements, it just worked to where the first time you got picked up you would get dropped/get the stun if you hit the skill check (or you could also save it by not going for the skill check) so all 4 survivors could run it and get a free get out of jail free card to run back to a loop and waste more of your time the first time they got downed. Although for a while you could just drop them when the skill check happened and if you got the timing right it would burn their DS for the whole game.
---
Still not great as killer on those ranks. Haven’t been able to rank up because the queues were ~ 5 min per match, and usually kick back from a DC or have a 3 person lock at the campfire. 
---
Been able to get survivor queues very quickly though.
---
even if they did that it would still make the likelihood of getting specific map offerings less likely by nature of there being more of them which is another problem of just bloating the web with them every single chapter.
---
No McLean? That's a bit sad. But we have Dave, Mr. Cote and Horvath so I guess it's okay.
---
Yeah but those threads are locked and old. Game gets updates, new players, and new opinions. Where is the DBD community on this now? Not interested in an outdated discussion
---
RIP the days of the [Hillbilly Space Program](https://youtu.be/dlZGrF4QzRs?t=18).
---
I think it floats, it kinda floats forward and goes back
---
;( I'm sorry I saw a Bing Bong one earlier and I decided to make a tbagging one
---
Why did you use Dead Hard and a Pallet while you still have DS ?  
---
Use Dead Hard if you need it after DS'ing the Killer :)  
---
Also don't make it too obvious with your wiggle dance because every good Killer would have known to NOT pick you up ;)
---
He’s a goodie two shoes
---
Is there any more survivor etiquette I should be aware of?
---
I prestiged roughly two days after the legacy event ended, after telling myself I didn’t want it
---
This is my favorite thing to happen when I play killer
---
i mean yeah it sucks people lost those but honestly i think health of the game is more important than cosmetics :c
---
When the gates are open ... all killer movements should be reduced by at least half in that area. As a survivor main, I find it toxic when other SWF players do this. We won, just leave. He was close enough that he could have made it out and shouldn’t.
---
Fair enough, but please explain why?
---
Spirit, Piggy, Nurse and Susie are S rank if you ask me
---
Separate tier for Plague who can bong but no Bing?
---
She was tunneling the life out of me the entire game. You can see she broke chase just to come after me again. I wanted to save DS for final hook, bc I knew I would be targeted again. Lol
---
Yeah, it's really weird that they kinda made Freddy a stealthy stall killer. Kinda the opposite of his MO.
---
Not sure who this dude is, but he grated on my nerves. I couldn’t finish the video.
---
Isn’t the nurse being shipped with the wraith by some of the devs?
---
I cannot understand how you could ever enjoy looking at Billy
---
I saw your counter argument below in the comments. 
---
The explanations as to why is the comment with which you responded. The devs tested this at one point and survivors trolled with it the entire time. 
---
Just because they’re not doing other tasks doesn’t make it a good idea. If nobody ever dies, the game can be held hostage and it will be outright boring.
---
Here in saudi Arabia it's actually perfect , we fast from 4 AM to 6 PM . The PTB opens 5PM and closes 11PM
---
Yep! That's why I found it so funny. Also, it saddens me that Billy boy didn't even got a name.
---
Its like an rbt with a headshot! Except no timer to remove it
---
Actually, wanted to ask about points, do you get more if there is only one last guy it he trial with EGC activated for simply leaving him to die to entity or you should down him and hook him?
---
I never trust teammates who use aftercare. Most of the time they use it to sandbag.
---
The emblem system is just not that great. So many times I say "I played super well so I'll pip" and I only safety pip. Other times I'm like "I played terribly and will probably depip" and I safety pip.
---
You find it toxic when survivors do that so you want to make it harder for the killer to punish them? I'm not following.
---
&gt;CHAPTER 12: GHOST FACE PANEL 
---
&gt;Discuss our vision of the new Killer 
---
&gt;Share the Killer’s background story 
---
&gt;Introduce the Killer gameplay (power and perks) 
---
So, no Sidney or Woodsboro map?
---
Behavior can't stop survivors from being salty babies
---
Not a bad idea
---
With a name like that I doesn’t surprise me that your entire comment history is literally all dead by daylight, memes, porn and fucking hentai 🤣🤣
---
If the leaks are accurate, it looks like there was a free track as well, so possibly goals will be regardless of the battlepass.
---
When Ghostface releases I will tbag with you
---
When I say movement I mean animation. Reduce the knife wipe or whatever they do so the survivor cannot crawl out during it.
---
Your wording did make it seem like you were gonna quit, now that you explained it better I understand now. I can agree that cosmetics don’t get me on the game (except prestige cosmetics, those are great).
---
Different teams work on the game, so the battle pass doesn’t take away devs from making content, but you probably already know that. 
---
Now that I know what you meant there is no argument here because I agree.
---
My comment is not nearly a toxic as the comment under mine tho, that kid is toxic.
---
Not even including Plague (who's allergic AF), not counting the other characters who wheeze + cough, AND using a racist slur?
---
It's worse than lazy lmao.
---
No Sidney? Darn.
---
You want survivors to stop doing that so you want to give them more of a reason to do it...? If anything killer speed should be increased in that area if you want survivors to stop doing it
---
Just the other game, I chainsaw a survivor working on the gen above my basement. I pick her up outside the shack and as I'm about to head in, I see Nea hiding behind the god pallet. Drop the survivor, chainsaw her down. Hook them both. First minute of the match.
---
BBQ reveals no other auras.
---
As predicted, someone immediately comes to save them.
---
And in post-game chat, somehow, I'm the camper and the bad guy.
---
Fuck yall this is my basement you are treading on private property.
---
I agree that the adept achievements shouldn’t be tied to it. The difficulty disparity between the Killer and Survivor adept achievements is immense. 
---
Also, since people don’t seem to understand why I said it should be nearly impossible to double-pip, it’s mainly because of you’re consistently double-pipping, then you’re not playing with/against people with a similar level of skill.
---
Yeah its just a killer it seems.
---
It really isn’t. Face camping is costly to a killer. It makes them lose both pressure and it makes them lose pip value. In no way is facecamping try hard. Soft camp can be try hard, but face camping is “I lost so I’m gonna make sure at least one of you goes down with me” or “I don’t like you so the others can go, you’re dead”
---
Yea and it should. The survivors failed the trial. That’s like saying the gates favor the survivor when all the gens are completed.
---
I think you're confusing calendar year with their game development year
---
Are you asking if the Nurse is “doing” Bing Bong?
---
Take the upvote because this is really funny
---
New goals for players? Maybe... new objetives?
---
I edited doe clarity. I mean the animation time. Or as you said increase movement. Had a brain fart.
---
How do I know as a survivor if the 5 blink nurse is venting her frustration or just playing the game?
---
Ohh okay. Sorry, yeah that would make sense to implement
---
Oh I get you. Yeah, that makes a lot more sense. My bad. That's actually a good idea.
---
Might have something to do with the basement blocking "fix"
---
Anyone else say out loud “sorry sorry sorry” while you run away?
---
Actually, you invalidated your entire argument by using such an asinine comparison. It'd be like if I correlated your actions to pedophiles, because what you wrote was pretty fucked up, but the comparison is fair because of how extreme you were.
---
This has been a bug literally since DS came out. Glad to see it’s literally never been fixed.
---
This ain’t a bad idea, tbh, i can support it
---
I definitely do, I feel so fucking guilty when someone comes along to help me speed it up and I immediately drop the ball. Worst feeling imo
---
It's literally what they did last year. He's using bhvr's past for reference.
---
They did a raffle
---
Why did you post this?
---
There's nothing fucked up about what I wrote. All I did was assert my point and then make the comparison to show you how stupid your argument was
---
Don’t take me wrong but I’ve never really understood the hate for SWF. I don’t think I’ve been depipped a single time as killer. 
---
Do killers take everything except a four man as a loss? Maybe Xbox survivors aren’t as good as PC players? I really don’t know.
---
Maybe ranks 1-10 and 11-20 could have different settings
---
Pig=upvote.
---
Update: I got my blood points, the dbd team were really helpful. Thanks for the advice
---
I have a full legacy wraith and nothing else on that front.
---
I mean going out of your way to ruin someone else's experience as a way of taking out your own frustrations is pretty close. Lmao, I remember when people took advantage of Friendly Fire Ricochet damage in the old Call of Duty days to ruin other people's matches by constantly jumping in front of them whenever they would fire a bullet or use an explosive, or trapping them in corners the entire match.
---
God forbid we all want to have an enjoyable experience.
---
Vanity mirror works pretty well with dead rabbit and M&amp;A, its pretty good
---
tfw you don't know if meyers is being friendly or building TEW meter
---
You don’t “heat” of it. You just know it has to be done.
---
Sounds about right.
---
Put Pig in S tier now
---
The PLAG doesn’t Yeet, she skeets
---
It always happens as soon as someone joins me, I think bc I do a lil change of my camera to see where they came from in case the killer followed their scratch marks
---
If they changed verticality BL might approach Adrenaline levels of instalock perks
---
Well, if they're too good to thank you for the heals then they're too good to get healed by you next time! Lol
---
Possibly. You remind me of a match I played last night. I was a baby Doctor, and everyone left when they realized who I was. Like, I only had one perk, why leave?
---
I got the idea because i remember seeing someone trapping a killer on larrys behind one of those benches and the trapper sometimes gets caught in his own traps.
---
Same lmao. Yesterday was the first time I heard him. It was crazy.
---
Not really, the pillow isn't a thinking, moving person who makes decisions [that affect the video game].
---
It’s not that gen rushing doesn’t exist, but sometimes to the detriment of the survivors, an early number of generators popping quickly can spell demise. After playing hag so much recently I have an odd stance on generators popping quickly. In the time it takes me to set up my areas and get into my first chase, I expect a generator to go off. I am also not running Ruin anymore due to its full inconsistent effect. I have found the most success with STBFL as people will be disturbed how fast you can end a chase when you chase people back into large minefields and down them in less than 3 sec cause you’re at 8 stacks. 
---
One thing that killer you described, OP, should learn more than anything is breaking a chase off. There’s one thing to not commit to a fruitless chase ( someone trying to run into a very safe building away from the remaining gens) but committing to a chase should still be met with time sensitivity.
---
Lol I was waiting for you
---
Oh I don't know.. maybe make a quality game alongside quality actual content topped off with maybe cosmetic microtransactions if you feel like having ongoing support for the game? You know, like it's supposed to be?
---
I could give less of a shit about battle passes in general or Fortnite, those are not my concern, BHVR is.
---
BHVR is in business for a very long time now, yet they still fail to make a basic game work right. They do the minimum amount of work and expect people to empty out their wallets.
---
If you think it's okay to "develop" new "content" and release more and more cosmetics while your game's literally broken for 5 months.. then I don't know honestly.
---
Wait... I am supposed to do a thank you squad?
---
Yeah, that happens I would say 7/10 games
---
To be fair you started it.
---
I don't think the map changes would be that drastic
---

---
To be quite honest I don't think it's a terrible idea to sell 2 characters per DLC and release 1 map for free, my problem is that the quality's lacking, a lot. DbD is out for 3 years now and it hasn't evolved a single bit. It took them 3 years to add endgame collapse to the game, which in my opinion was not needed and doesn't add anything to the game's experience.
---
She dced because I downed her within the first few minutes of the match.
---
You are exactly right. I think it comes down to that biological reaction of "familiarity" we experience when we see another person's face. There is a sense of social connection when you are actually physically with another person that is completely devoid on the internet. Afterall, who gives a shit about text on a screen? Or perhaps it is the fleeting sense of anonymity.
---
While I absolutely disagree with people complaining about the temple of purgation map, I really wish that the legions skiing lodge had included a partial slope area
---
*0.5 shekels have been deposited in your account*
---
Yes sir coming right up
---
Freddy has always been an endgame killer, look at his teachables
---
I dont read rage essays from claudette mains sorrt.... Go crouch in some grass
---
I can't extend chase on new legion for shit though. They catch up so god damn quickly lmao.
---
Yes. Spirit sticking her Kitana/sword into it is everything.
---
Uhh spoiler tag?
---
You do get rewarded. 
---
You get shards for playing the game and leveling up...and shards are used to buy non licensed killers or outfits...thus meaning that playing the game and leveling up rewards you...
---
hmm
---
Oh yeah
---
To me it still feels like the red forest but with little temple like fixtures. The middle is great but imo the whole map should have been inside a tomb like the middle. It looks like they started with the middle and then we're just like fuck it put it in the red forest. Imagine how cool a whole tomb would have looked.
---
True true
---
Because whenever you get something in the free tier you see what you're not getting (judging by the pictures leaked). As I said, it might sound illogical (and might be),  but I can't help but feel ungratified.
---
probably dead hard, iron will, self care, adrenaline
---
Old School player (Since 2015-2016) didn't knew that was a thing, i thought that was for the game to detect your near teammates and give the bonus points...
---
Why do these posts always make me chuckle? 
---
madness luv, lit rally madness
---
Wow that looks like game cube r u sure it’s ps1
---
Wraith can do an equivalent of teabagging by spamming his bell infront of someone
---
BINGBONGBINGBONGBINGBONG
---
Are you just going to continue to spam these? 
---
How long til mods put "tier list" in the prohibited posts list?
---
My guess is that Ghostface is going to be the last DLC until September; with BHVR spending the interim focusing on ports, dedicated servers and game health.
---
Freddy rework, map reworks, and official gameplay and info on Ghostface? Sounds like a date.
---
I’ve played dbd for a loonnnngg time and I don’t think I’ve seen a more big brain play than that, nice fucking job man LMAO
---
This is probably a better wording and closer to what I meant
---
Now killers have an uncounterable crutch perk (like DS was for a long time) so it's a bit of a tables have turned kinda thing
---
I genuinely feel bad for survivors who get blood hardened sometimes though. You time it right it's an automatic win
---
Ex: Hook a guy 2 times. Have EGC start, have the timer at less than 1 minute to collapse, than hook the 2 hooked guy. He instantly dies keeping the timer going full speed, but blood warden still keeps everyone from leaving for that last minute
---
If killer is smart they auto win by not touching anyone else (therefore not slowing the timer) and camping the hatch in case all but 1 DCs to open it
---
"This has been a bug literally since DS came out"
---
nooo, it was bugged only on KYF.
---
Feeling that you could get the cosmetics other way and them not being exklusive to the pass might help. So I have to agree to this.
---
What a wonderful addition to my post, thanks!
---
I label all of them shitposts.
---
Because they are.
---
Do you not understand this? It’s not meant to be serious
---
Yep
---
Mein Camp
---
Really? That kinda interpretation never even crossed my mind :D Sounds kinda cool tho
---
Yeah the shitposty lists have been posted so often that they’re not really funny anymore.
---
I love how they aren't even pretending it's a secret anymore.
---
I pissed myself when I saw the names were Brayden, Jayden, Aidan and Kaden. Good shit.
---
I guess a penny reward is still a reward to some...
---
How is MoM so good as people say . I gotta watch some videoes about it
---
So it refers to ghostface as a "chapter".  Doesn't that mean map + survivor?
---
Perhaps the next proper Chapter will include 2 maps, similar to the Flesh and Mud.
---
Shitpost does not justify your spam.
---
I have the game across all 3 platforms and it’s actually harder on consoles because of the controller. PC just has as a larger player base and is much easier to play due to the keyboard and mouse. Game settings is not an issue on any platform. Its a performance thing. 
---
SWF players are mostly toxic players especially at lower ranks. They have an ability that most killers cannot counter, communication. But if they knew in advance they were up against a duo or squad group, that advantage would be gone. 
---
I’ve been saying this for over a year, yet all they do is nerf this one or buff that one and will continue to chase their tails until they either drive really good players away or fix the issue. 
---
When you play, PUBG, Fortnite or Blackout. You choose your mode and play to win. You can’t expect to win in a duo or in this case squad without communication. So let it be it’s on mode and be done with it and let the rest of us play the game the way it was intended to be played.
---
when someone dcs on hook 😏
---
I have the game since day 1 but only started to get really into it like last summer so no legacy for me
---
Not really. I quit playing FN because I felt like I couldn't get things fast enough or at the rate of other players without having to pay.
---
Even when I’m playing with a friend and we’re in a party I still butt dance for them if they heal me instead of just saying thanks
---
They called Ash vs. The Evil Dead a Chapter. This 100% confirms that it's just Ghostface.
---
It is smart business, very smart. and I think they might a lot of money out of it. But I simply rather not play than feel like I'm missing out.   
---
I'm not saying it's wrong, I'm saying I think it may remove my enjoyment of the game. (which is bad for me, and I don't think I'm alone in this. but not inherently evil or anything.)
---
I have almost no trouble getting 4ks most matches at any ranks nowadays. Maybe 1/10 is a 2k. If you dont understand people complaining about someone who would have killed no one, killing multiple people solely due to one perk, then you should think harder about it.
---
Is Samination a dev now?
---
4 percent my ass
---
Basically 4 sections of the stream, each with a different focus and set of guests.
---
All CHAPTERS have a killer, a survivor, and a map. Why is everyone assuming that we aren't going to get a survivor or map?
---
There really needs to be a DBD Etiquette class or something. There seems to be all these unwritten rules that are not intuitive to me that people seem to get really pissed off about when you don't follow. Also lots of subtle gameplay mechanics that I keep seeing posts on reddit of people being very rageful because people don't like.
---
Yeeeeees idk why people are questioning this.
---
Funny. Unlockables used to be free. Playing online used to be free. Save slots used to be free. 
---
Companies are monetizing anything and everything. But these are things the customer wants, so why not charge them for it?
---
That feeling when I haven't played killer since rank reset.
---
Detective picachu is adorable
---
Her weapon is just smaller graphically. Even so it still has the hitbox of say billys club because all killers have the same hitboxes. Their working on fixing animations to reveal the true range but their not changing the range itself.
---
With the next content update :(
---
tbh i dont like the spirit fury and enduring build, its just very boring to me and sloppy butcher i already run cause i kniw it slows down slightly without bieng as annoying as ruin
---
Guacamole
---
Who pissed in your cereal?
---
Battles passes aren't made to be super grindy or feel like work, they are designed so that you have to play the game but not to the extent to where is grindy and tedious. At that point if playing the game still feels like work then you shouldn't be that upset that your missing out on stuff if you don't even play the game that much.
---
Why Ghostface isn't in SS++ tier ?
---
Order is vague and just a general overview. Obviously certain perks are very useful or very bad depending on what killer you are playing and things like that.
---
Ok, but Bubba came in Leatherface paragraph. Devs need some consistency.
---
Hurr durr tierlist bad
---
Patch 3.0: All perks, offerings and items have been removed for balance
---
I don’t have ghostfave at my disposal ;-;
---
Right and they won’t do anything about it even had video proof I had it
---
Guess you're just the best killer in the world then. I'm honored.
---
Sniff sniff
---
Yeah, i didn't even knew about the "Thank you Squat", the only time i squat no bm is to say "Hey man i'm here please heal me / help me with this gen"
---
Also the arms dance on the hook is to say "This bitch is camping me, take care or just don't come" and when i stop that means the killer is gone... but for some reason some people hook dance on the hook to say "come here and save me fast" so is very confusing, i might be outdated tho
---
I mean it’s not like it’s gonna hurt u or hold the game hostage
---
i have a legacy 3 nea, but a lot of people have hacked legacy it was really easy to edit the savefile back then.
---
What are you on? What exploit
---
I disagree. The devs need money to keep supporting this game, and I think a battlepass is a good way to do that. They are not obligated to add or change anything at this point, so as a business they need to make money to keep us going with updates and new stuff ect
---
It's bully time
---
FALSE QUEEN
---
SPIT ON HIM
---
What does ruin have to do with that perk??
---
Just use SC, Adren, MoM and DH like 90% of meta fags.
---
Nah this is good killers already get priority in a lot of things
---
Not a particularly rare occurrence but nice job anyway (^_^)
---
LMFAO I LOVE THIS SO MUCH
---
Ah yes the classic "i don't have a counter argument so i'm going to act like a child"
---
very smart.
---
Average at best? The spirit fury/enduring combo is arguably the best combo for any M1 killer. It deserves to be in high tier IMO. 
---
Also OP good list for the most part, but I disagree with the placement of deerstalker. That shit should be at least in B
---
I think their point was you posting too many of the same kind of post in a short time span, not that it's a tier list.
---
Don't think he was serious
---
That's fine as long as I dont get annoyed bc I'm hit even tho she whiffs lol
---
Not this one, just reminded me of all the expectations people have on the knowledge level of other players and that when I've had questions, the posts I search and find are usually very "heated".
---
Wait it says chapter 12 if ash was a chapter than it would be chapter 13 now
---
That "Yee haw" probably translates to either "fucking devs" or "fucking kill me"
---
Exactly you now know why we believe there is no survivor.
---
Lack of consistency with Chapter term+No Survivor in Leaks+No Survivor reveal section in roadmap+"Ghostface Chapter"= Very likely no survivor
---
Fucking kill me
---
No, this is coldwind farm.
---
Oh God oh fuck he's got his motor-operated chain-based cutting machine out!!
---
Freddy would by higher then a normal person since you can't get salmonella in a dream and he is pre cooked
---
I've had matches as a killer where I really like completely by coincidence I just kept running into the same survivor and hooking him. I got a message about tunneling but like
---
I dunno I just kept bumping into him
---
It might be they are relatively new maybe? Also it could be because the person who unhooked you ran away instead of trying to run interference.
---
r/dbdLFG
---
a person who can’t spell “thoughts” thoughts are irrelevant
---
why should he? he's proxy camping, tunneling off hooks, nothing but deserved imo
---
Still looks like trash tho
---
No.
---
i’m so sorry, i didn’t know this sub reddit existed! thanksb
---
it's a bad perk without enduring
---
Dislike this comment...
---
Just a little bit
---
There's always gonna be that one asshole who doesnt do this. So no. No thank you.
---
That pose she strikes ugh queen
---
I love Monto but he’s SO SHINY, like gurl, get some blotting papers and setting powder
---
yeah, meant enduring. I'm dumb
---
Not all heroes wear capes.
---
True but nobody runs it without enduring anyway so its not like that matters lol
---
Discordance, Whispers, Remember Me are too high and Monitor and Abuse and Deerstalker are too low. 
---
Discordance is very overrated, survivors won't work together on a gen very often and once they find out that you have Discordance, they will counter it by just spread out the team. Whispers is another perk who gets too much credit, it's good on Huntress and Nurse and it's not a bad perk in general, but it's already not too hard to find survivors and Whispers is outclassed by Surveillance. Remember Me just was nerfed with End Game Collapse, while Blood Warden was even buffed, but for some weird reason it's under Remember Me in your tier list. Monitor and Abuse is good on many killers and you put A Nurse's Calling pretty high, but without Monitor and Abuse, A Nurse's Calling is pretty useless on killers with normal terror radius. Deerstalker is good for tracking your slugs and in combo with A Nurse's Calling, it's decent on killers who can snow ball quickly like Nurse, Billy, Huntress, Spirit or Shape.
---
My thing is that if you are playing an m1 killer you should be running enduring anyway so you can disrespect pallets and not waste time being stunned. So spirit fury slots into there pretty well.
---
Don't get me wrong, I'd like to see Myers shirtless any day. I'm just not into guy butt 🤷
---
Wake me up inside
---
because 90% of the time I try to play fairly I get absolutely shit on and tbagged at the gate
---
it might not be top-tier on its own, but it's still deadly
---
ohhhh right that’s jogged my memory a bit, 4 DS was an absolute piss take
---
What’s the vanilla experience test?
---
This is why gaymers are oppressed
---
I think the best sound under that definition is the Huntress', where she throws a small tantrum. Because when it happens for a 10th time against a Rank 2 P3 teabagging Ace with a Super Flashlight, that's exactly how I sound inside my head.
---
*downs in bubba noises*
---
Fedora wearing Dwight creeping in the background makes this perfect
---
10/10 would boop snoot
---
Yeah, but if survivors go to cleanse totems, they can't finish all gens in 4 minutes, so the killer has more time to kill them. That time can be huge depending on what killer do you play.
---
Fucking Legend
---
Am I missing something here?   There is no proximity chat?   I think you’re getting the game mixed up with Friday the 13th
---
&gt; This is a subtle nod the fact that I will not like the video. 
---
Weird Flex.
---
But alright.
---
Iirc this was something they discussed on one of the community art portions of their streams several months ago.
---
That's just what we call pillow talk, baby. Nothing more.
---
if you make a tier list about perks you should rank them by themselves and not in combination with another perk imo
---
Bloker ends up as the first one to be hit
---
You think it adds that much time for each survivor to break a single dull totem?  Atleast one of the four is going to be actively looking for ruin, which is more or less mandatory at those ranks.
---
They should honestly just remove the offerings for survivors. Reduce their price and make them killer-only.
---
The only time I ever find myself using offerings as survivor is when I'm about to prestige and use up all my junk, or if I want to run Balanced Landing.
---
Look who's shitting in the tall grass!
---
Nah , just until the heartbeat starts
---
Let’s be honest enduring isn’t top tier without it too tho especially after the changes there making to it.
---
Yeah, explained a bit roughly. He memed and moonwalkes during the entire match, that wasnt a real facecamp. He let dwight unhook me
---
He should have an alt, it sounds like a bug?
---
He has a non holstered pants, hatless, jacket as his alt.
---
Curse you Jeff Q. Haddonfield, and your successful buisness of Rank 20 maps!
---
I hope this one does
---
* **Platform**: PS4
---
* **Type of Bug**: Ingame
---
* **Description**: Hooks don't progress for everybody and killer is forced to disconnect or let everybody bleed out to end the game if nobody unhooks or disconnects. I don't know a way to reproduce.
---

DC'ing before the final survivor escapes.
---
Now this I can absolutely agree with
---
Yeah that's what I thought, but I cant find it in his customization tab or the store.
---
The real Life Pro Tip is always in the comments 👌
---
Do any of the sales extend to consoles?
---
Camping doesn't need a "fix"
---
Ruin
---
BBQ
---
Enduring
---
Spirit fury
---
You can also use stbfl, sloppy butcher, nurses calling, brutal strength and many others
---
Ah yes, the Thank you squat. Make sure not to mistake this for the F\*\*\* you point, and definitely not the heal me Squat. And definitely not the Bad killer squat
---
It's not in the store.
---
Send a support ticket sounds like a bug i still have my customisation.
---
Did you buy him with cells or the saw chapter?
---
Did you buy him with Auric Cells?
---
I think haddonfield sucks for looping tbh
---
It's not so bad if you think of the map like a grid, they are always separated by a distance of say 32 meters or so, it's not too bad if you listen for their sound effect and do a quick once over.
---
The Game I'll give you though, some of those totem spawns are so obnoxious.
---
Cells, do you have to buy the expansion to get it?
---
Unfortunately
---
Y yes you need the chapter to unlock the alternate outfit.
---
Did you get Tapp from the store, or did you buy the DLC?
---
What does it need then, wise master
---
You're just helping the killer by doing this
---
Its a beta testing for only 500 people, no perks no add ons and you play 15 matches, you get a reward for it
---
Because it can straight up deny a killer a sacrifice
---
Store
---
As a Killer main, this is enlightening. The array of emotions these creatures can display in their natural habitat with a single tea-bag is breathtaking.
---
Monto banned me from his channel bc I looped him for 4 gens got downed once and escaped and said "gg, better luck next game". I notice this is a trend with streamers and it's just so hard to take them seriously now. Though to be fair all of their followers are a huge echo chamber who are all telling them they're right no matter what, so I mean
---
If you want to heal your teammate on the way out real quick, I get that. We all do that. This wasn’t that in most of the clips. 
---
There are just assholes who don’t want to leave and just want a chance to taunt the killer they outplayed.  They are the reason we have the new end game.
---
This makes me realize we actually need a gun Killer. Not sure how the mechanics would work in a fair way, but it's time.
---
&gt; It's not about them knowing that you're venting, it's the idea itself.
---
So basically your point is that my state of mind is unfair to survivors even if it makes absolutely zero difference to them. Smells a lot like thought policing to me
---
&gt; They in turn get upset too, and might vent on someone else. This process repeats itself and is self-sustaining. 
---
How can the process of toxicity repeat itself if, by your own words, 5 blink nurse is A-ok. No toxicity happened except, perharps, in the killers mind which anyway is a non-issue because the survivors cant tell
---
&gt; More and more people are just using the most meta stuff and play as sweaty as possible, even if they are having less fun doing it, just because others are doing it too.
---
Oh so now going for meta builds is not ok anymore? Its getting hard to follow.
---
&gt; that whole last paragraph
---
This is a whole another subject my dude, unless you actually consider meta build to be toxic, which the second paragraph strongly suggested. Any game with rankings will be dominated by the most eficient way to play at the top ranks, but again, this shouldnt be a problem considering what you wrote earlier
---
You make no sense whatsoever, and I strongly suspect youre trying to encourage people to play in a way that *you* find more enjoyable without considering other people idea of fun. And all that under the cover of a "less toxic" environment for all.
---
tl;dr: Fuck off, you dont get to tell people how to play the game
---
Legacy Claudette coming through, make way
---
got a link for that animation?
---
Sometimes. But at least I have borrowed time and sacrifice myself for them to get away. But I mostly only do it with my friends nowadays cuz I get tired of playing with horrible randoms that let me die my first time on hook when the killer isn’t camping
---
He does tunnel a fuck ton too.
---
Dude prestige 3?!?!?! Do you realize how long it took to level up back then??? P3 would kill you
---
Meatballs!
---
I want Myers to diddle my butthole
---
How does Technician help you in that scenario?
---
Sloppy and nurses are perfect together. But if I was you I'd choose a perk that helps with gens, like thanta,pop,discordiance, huntress lullaby, unnerving presence, overcharge..
---
You dont hear me working on the gen as soon as you turn the other way
---
That explains it; you need the DLC for the exclusive cosmetics.
---
with the add on that makes her phasing silent, monitor lets her get close enough to pull unsuspecting survivors off of gens 
---
i run monitor, ruin, thrill of the hunt and BBQ 
---
BBQ gives me blood points. monitor lets me get close enough to pull people off of gens, and thrill lets me protect my totems while also pulling people off of them
---
damn you just made my evening
---
If it’s red it’s slow, yellow is faster.
---
It might slow your progress, but since your working on a gen together your progress together is faster than you alone
---
I love his little giggles when he shocks people
---
Fuck you im still using fire up! I don’t care if it’s shit!
---
In my opinion, the best Spirit perk setup is BBQ, Ruin, Nurse's and Sloppy.  
---
If you don't feel like you need Ruin, use Whispers.
---
“Dear Balanced Landing,
---
Choke on a dick and die.
---
Sincerely, every killer on Haddonfield”
---
So you're using Prayer Beads? y i k e s
---
nothing. it's fine
---
Whether you ACTUALLY have NOED has no bearing on whether people break totems. Regardless, it's increasingly common to not break totems and just remember where they are should NOED come up.
---
Why isn't doc in the top?  You can spam switching to treatment mode from punishment and you're living the salt bae meme.
---
Original?
---
I pushed a camping leather face into a corner while he was chasing an unhooked Claudette last night, too bad the Meg who unhooked her died after the doors were opened
---
I dont get the hype with this dude... hes not fun to watch. I LOVE watching KITTYCHIPZ!! shes so entertaining and an awesome at survivor, with the looping and mind gaming killers.
---
This breaks the rules of the Geneva convention.
---
A decent ideal. But like he said, this particular "fix" was tested by the devs and it didn't work, like some of the other ideas thrown around by people.
---
Check my tag for the true high class Billy
---
I doubt it, that's generally not how reworks work. I'm almost certain that Freddy will retain his major strengths and weaknesses and the defining characteristics of his identity as a killer, but will gain more tools that will help him accentuate his strengths while mitigating his weaknesses. The major things that need looked at are how survivors get into the dream state, and how survivors get out of the dream state. They need to make the dream transition less cumbersome to deal with and they need to make it harder and less rng dependent to escape after being brought into the dream world. It would also help if they reduced his terror radius to sixteen meters from 24 which would help him to ambush survivors making up for his poor chase potential and enhancing his natural aura reading ability.
---
Nah I'm good.
---
My point exactly. The actual loops on that map are horrible but there's an inexhaustable amount of windows and safe pallets that even a Rank 20 could survive on it.
---
There's literally zero Killer-to-Survivor interaction on Haddonfield beyond "Did the Killer bring Bamboozle?" and "Did the Survivors bring Balanced Landing?" Or as it's more commonly known: "Did the Killer win or did the Survivors win?"
---
This is exactly what battlepasses are designed to do.
---
You either feel like you're missing out, which pressures you to buy the pass,
---
Or you feel pressured to play the game, since you bought the battlepass, and if you don't play, you feel like you wasted money.
---
People who play the game all the time will not see a problem, because they play all the time and won't see a downside to the battlepass.
---
It's just manipulative marketing bullshit and it leaves a seriously sour taste in my mouth.
---
Nurses is great on her because for some reason survivors keep on healing even when within her terror radius which means you can pop out of phase on top of them.
---
Fair enough
---
Because you're rank 14.  Get out of that rank quickly..  I'd suggest playing swf with people in purple ranks.
---
i agree with this meme
---
U don’t enjoy being scared for your life every time you go to repair a gen?
---
Type of Bug: Visual.
---
Description: Ormond map is broken.  Red auras are practically invisible and scratch marks spawn underneath the snow for a lot off the map.  This is not a new bug, but it still has not been fixed, 
---
 just making sure that you know it is still in the game.
---
Steps to reproduce: Play as Killer (maybe survivor too, I don't play with maps/dejavu so I don't know), on Ormond map.
---
Expected result: You should have a map that works.
---
Actual result: You don't.
---
Reproduction rate: 100%

System Specs (PC only): Ryzen 7 2700, GTX 1080ti, 16GB DDR4 3200, Samsung Evo 970 1TB.
---
niiiice one, you got me bro.
---
Depends on the situation. Wouldn’t call it tunneling if they’re there when your unhooked cuz it’s only natural to get an injured survivor back on a hook, but if they blatantly go out of their way to ignore everyone but you then yeah
---
Sloppy can help while phasing because there's more blood to follow, definitely not a bad perk
---
I might be wrong, but I don't believe that Dying Light affects exit gates.
---
Actually I think hillbilly should have been A tier. S tier is supposed to be identifiable before the killer does anything
---
It doesn't, but it makes healing and gens hell
---
Myers is easy because his tier up sound plays for the entire game so you know it’s Myers. I do agree I put hillbilly too low
---
This whole chain of comments is gold
---
Kobes?
---
That's hilarious considering that killer isnt even a legit 19, he has tier 3 perks and different ones from different killers.
---
I know how sounds work. I use it for a gen jockey build with spine chill, as soon as he turns around after kicking it you get back on the gen. I've gotten survivors do this to me as killer without Technician and those clicks are very loud.
---
You say that like there is a skill to running in circles...
---
Basically all the killers would still run perks and they'd destroy me good.
---
All of them...
---
Exactly. Even a mediocre nurse is still better than any other killer. If Nurse fucks up, she's back on your ass in seconds and ignoring your methods of trying to escape. If another killer misses their chance at a hit, the survivor gets to a window or pallet and the killer gets screwed over much harder.
---
Oh really? That's awesome
---
Daddy Myers is a very good and fun killer or Bubba for bbq and chilly perk.
---
It would be nice just having the penalty applied at the start of the transition instead of at the end. I would really like to see them making it so you can grab people of stuff while in the transition and they need to universally change pick ups to be able to override healing actions.
---
Damn this is some high level Killer bias
---
I think that BHVR should give legacy to all players who played 3 years ago. Game was full of bugs and it was really hard for killers. Survivors was insanely overpowered. Each killer who played deserve legacy for each character :D
---
Pig tbags the hatch, causing it to be sad and closing.
---
Sometimes players suck so bad that camping is a viable strategy. I got hooked by a face camping Doc and tried to warn the others that he was camping and that they should do gens. They all were sneaking around like they were going to get me off the hook. I even had Kindred III on. 
---
Oddly enough, these players had multiple tier III perks on. Killer ended up with a 3k and camping every single hook he got. Yet these survivors didn't rush to do gens.
---
[https://imgur.com/a/FBzgrS5](https://imgur.com/a/FBzgrS5)
---
Idk. For new people it's really hard to get out of those ranks. For me I'll have nights where I just destroy the competition and then matches that are just tunneling and face camping and it knocks me back to the rank I started with. It's super frustrating. My only option I think is to start being selfish at end game or something.
---
"you need a smoke mccote?"
---
That was my thinking but they could be right too.
---
I mean the rate they’re at now, they’re dropping a $10 cosmetic pretty much weekly.  If they’re was an opportunity to earn most of those through a 3 month $10 battle pass, I think that’s a good value to us.
---
I agree with that.
---
when you are gods gift to a dwight player
---
it also technically wasn't a part of Flesh and Mud, either.
---
Not at all, just stating obvious facts, I'm not even sure I disagree with them. New survivors still struggle a lot. Maybe this is the right way to design the game.
---
If there isn't then why am I getting looped for 3 gens by skilled players while I myself can't loop a killer for more than one pallet? Spoiler: because I suck. I have no skill. Therefore looping takes skill. Quod Erat Demonstrandum, motherfucker.
---
i'm still leveling her up for Ruin
---
Diversity is nice. Monto is original and it is reason why people like hin.
---
Hag can kinda teabag people by tapping M2. She crouches down to place a trap, so y'know.
---
Is it worth not waiting the extra 5 seconds for me to walk away?
---
Every game I know of with a battle pass, they’re is also free tiers, which gives you free rewards, which right now all we have is earning thousands of shards for a select few cosmetics
---
Usually called when survivors unhooks themselves
---
No, pig is more of a B, ghostface is S tier
---
amazing
---
i should have the evil incarnate trophy but a stupid rank 20 dced which was so stupid i still should get it that guy should be banned
---
Similar to back revving with Hillbilly, get on the survivors ass and then charge puke. You can also play pallets like Huntress.  
---
Perks: basic M1 build(BBQ, Ruin, Enduring, SF)  
---
Add-ons: efficiency is the best and apples work on decent teams.  
---
How to win: hope the survivors cleanse like idiots.
---
It doesn't matter, Freddy is still last on the list.

I use it mainly to practice Great Skill Checks, not gonna lie
---
Finally an S tier for my guy Freddie
---
That’s interesting
---
Try using Corrupt Intervention then, or just throw Whispers if you have it.
---
I have this happen a lot w/o even being downed.  I’ll try to get healed by a survivor and they’ll just stare at me blankly for awhile squirming around and then shake their head.  Pretty big issue for sure.
---
as a main I'll say this
---
I wasn't afraid of them being bad after all those nerfs because salty survivors and bug-abusing killers aside legion wasn't even that good without rare addons at red ranks
---
what I was afraid of was that they would become boring... and that did happend they are now a generic M1 Killer yes you get a free hit with frenzy but that's really It you will never ever down someone with deep wound again, vaulting stuff has become so painfully slow that I'd rather go around or break the pallet, oh and every single legion addon Is now a joke.
---
most killers yellow addons &gt; Legions purple addons that's no hyperbole It's a fact
---
legion Isn't unique anymore doesn't mean he's now much worse they are just not as fun anymore
---
Personally the add-ons that make perps sick faster I like. Perks I am messing with due to me prestiging her. General strat is vommie on perps until broken then M1. If they heal use corrupted for mid range Hits. Spray und pray usually helps in lower ranks but don't get too reliant on it.
---
No he’s not
---
her one ultra rare is great if you just want to use her phase walk to move around the map quickly rather than to mind game in chases. 
---
so its most useful in all hex builds for spirit since it can get you to any totem that goes off before it has time to be cleansed
---
i see you're a man of culture as well
---
Yes that’s how capitalism works.  It costs money to run a developer studio.  Yea you didn’t have to pay for things like that in the old days of gaming, but the games also weren’t updated.  You paid for the game as is, and it was like that forever...no content, no bug fixes, no changes whatsoever.  You’re paying for that service.
---
Only legacy 1 on Claudette because I did not want to grind the shit out of anyone else. Y'all ain't seen shit about the grind unless you played back then
---
i don't have any of Plague's perk but i do have Whispers and it's only tier 1 so i don't bother using it since it will be active the whole match
---
I would say the same for survivors
---
Happens to me as survivor as well
---
Sounds like a cool and unique idea, but I think I'd want to see a rework for older perks like Left Behind and No One Left Behind first.  
---
I think you mean "on *the killer's* shoulder" and not "on *your* shoulder*
---
this is great
---
\*Angry spirit noises\*
---
i'm in this photo and i do not like it  lol
---
I mean, I can't disagree with the logic. Picking your nose is a skill too, you still have to aim your finger at your nostril instead of your eye, but I think "skilled looper" sounds about as silly as "skilled nose picker".
---
&gt; Or maybe they bought the shitton-cheap-but-grindy-inside edition? I heard PC has one
---
Thats actually exactly the version i had, i got it for free on Uplay. Once you realize you can upgrade it to the normal standard edition in the ingame store for *steel*, and not much (was something like 20-30k steel for all year one heroes, i think. Did that a while ago) even that edition isnt too grindy with the decent amount of steel you get just for dailies and orders.
---
Thanks. I’ve heard a lot that Plague is better when survivors are cleansing.
---
you forgot ghostface
---
Very impractical in comparison to her very rares.
---
Ew NoED. Downvoted
---
Legion should struggle to close it then the other 3 show up to help.
---
Well said
---
Its buggy.
---
The survivor did it on purpose with her legs in the window
---
No he just isn't released yet
---
Well, M&amp;A is a no-go because you don't want a bigger terror radius.  
---
Haunted Grounds or Make Your Choice might be nice; it's easy to get hits with her.
---
If you're looking at pips to win then yea you can win without a kill, it's not easy but you can. You can also lose with a 4k for camping/first hook killing everyone. If you're talking about winning as in having fun then it's up to the player. Maybe the killer is trying to get a ride outta survivors and that's their fun. 
---
I personally like a challenge. If I get 0k but it was really competitive then usually I count that as a win because I had fun. I personally hate games where the players are too altruistic and I don't leave hook because they keep throwing themselves at the player as soon as they get hooked and I get a 4k because I'm "camping". 
---
What do you think is going to happen when you follow killer to the hook?
---
Hag can teabag survivors ;) Not as good as Pig but still, she should be B-C tier
---
When survivors cleanse, they basically give her super-powers.  
---
If they don't cleanse, you're in a pretty bad position.
---
When you oversimplify any mechanic, you can always make it sound like it involves no skill. Spacing and footsies in fighting games is just stepping forward and backwards. Takes no skill. Except it's a huge fucking deal that separates the good players from the bad.
---
Please kys, unironically
---
oops, i meant to say that he's much better than before. He's decent now
---
this is the funniest post i have seen all day
---
Chillax. You're letting my you:pedo analogy distort the entire argument that your reasoning to use the same analogy was flawed.
---
Batman the animated series
---
Nice cosplay, but i don't like Legion
---
The excuses thing, everyone does it lol. I’m more about the tunneling he does being annoying.
---
I like these ideas.
---
I'm honored.
---
The free tier isn't the battle pass. That's just stuff you get for free.
---
Remember Survivors: Every Killer that is playing like an asshole is a result of somebody being a needless dick to a Killer who was trying to play honorably. Don't be a dick. Someone else doesn't have a good time playing the game because of you next game.
---
I take personal offense when the courtesy tbag is not given. I thought we were a team
---
It's because you're rank 14 and the killers you're facing are too bad to do anything else
---
That would be fucking hilarious
---
When I get Haddonfield, my game mysteriously crashes.
---
Okay thanks.
---
And that's why I run spine chill as survivor lol
---
Myers*
---
*you uncultured swine*
---
I'm not 100% sure if it's a bug or if I missed a note on it but 
---
Platform: PC (maybe all)
---
Type of Bug: Ingame
---
Description: When playing Trapper and Hag, I kept having an issue where I could not place my traps in loop areas (mostly around pallets). I do not remember this being an issue in previous patches as it's where I would normally place them.
---
I swear I've seen this a little bit ago.
---
Except you never addressed my argument. You only attacked the comparison
---
i completely forgot about MYC, i think i'll use that instead of STBFL
---
Amanda should be alone in her highest tier :D Doctor and Huntress should be higher!
---
The fact that it's a huge deal speaks to its effectiveness, not the skill involved in executing the move. If I step around a huge puddle on my way to work, it's a pretty huge deal, my shoes and socks won't be wet for the rest of the day, but I wouldn't exactly demand a Nobel prize for it.
---
Okay, thanks
---
I feel like I’m the only teammate that TRIES to find the totem and save his teammate :/
---
WAZZZZUUP
---
Ash looking extra T H I C C in that picture
---
iron will and self care are great perks if you like to stay hidden and make sure you're 100% healed at all times. IMO they can be somewhat of trap perks because they encourage you to hide and waste a lot of time healing. I've explained this before, but I personally hate self care. There are too many killers you can't, or shouldn't heal against, and a lot of them run sloppy butcher which can make healing take upwards of 40 seconds. I hate being on the hook and seeing my last 2 alive teammates self caring against a sloppy butcher legion and letting me get to second state before saving me. It's better to just let a teammate heal you, or to bring a med kid. I'd prefer other perks such as DS, since I get tunneled off hook roughly 90% of all games, WGLF if I want BP, or deliverance, borrowed time, or if you want to MoM.
---
How’s your butthole doing?
---
like for example.....?
---
You seem like a nice person so here’s what I think. If they just make deep wound do something anything I think he will be in a good spot is that so mush to ask?
---
A much better perk imo,
---
Camper confirmed
---
The only thing we were waiting for.
---
anyway, thank you for the advice
---
Well I'm not a survivor main and I wasn't talking about Legion being better or worse so I don't see the point in your comment. I'm just making fun of the guy because almost every single post or comment he's ever made is him being pessimistic and hyperbolic about everything.
---
No problem!
---
this made me laugh thank you
---
Jesus.
---
she's 96.5%
---
???
---
it still fits a niche for certain spirit builds so i wont write it off 
---
her other ultra rare is trash though
---
"???" indeed
---
too easy to be used to trolling, also this idea sucks and you're bad
---
You're the only person I've ever seen say that second part.
---
Dat360NoScope is better
---
Very suspicious link.. may be an ip grab. but I'm pretty sure it's not a virus.
---
I too am in Rochester
---
First time I wanted to do this, I was so nervous, I pulled down a pallet. Try to explain this without words...
---
That was great!
---
Still no cuts :(
---
Mother Daughter Ring is very powerful too. 
---
Father Glasses sucks ass.
---
This is a counter to trolls?   So how is this even remotely good for trolling?      Oh ha ha ha. I’m on the hook for even longer.  Such great troll.
---
\&gt; it's gonna feel like I'm missing out. 
---
Riiiiight? But maybe, now hear me out, maaaaybe, if you just put a couple of bucks, just a couple no-nothing TOO expensive here, just you know a couple of- couple of bucks towards the battle pass, then uhhh you'll get all that sweet loot, all for a lil', just a lil' a lil' lil', just a lil' fee.
---
&gt;Killer tier list but it's based on how weird their porn is
---
So Trapper is Fred from Scooby Doo?
---
Again, if there is no skill in executing the move, and everyone knows basically how to execute the move, then it should make no difference between skilled players and bad players. It makes a big difference. Some people are more skilled at it than others. There are others out there that are more skilled than you at looping, and others that are worse.
---
killer comes by
---
person tries to unhook you because of btw
---
denies them the unhook and they die
---
in swf
---
friend has wglf
---
doesnt let anybody but your friend unhook 
---
baby dwight plays
---
accidently kicks you off the hook
---
its a shitty idea and you know it
---
Survivors with legacy are usually tunnelled and facecamped. It is reason why survivors don't use legacy or any exclusives. I have lunar cosmetics from 2016 and 2017 and killers usually tunnel me.
---
I don't like Monitor and Abuse on her. It messes up with her power and wooshing sound. You should run it just with Prayer Beads.
---
It is cool except since it’s Legion I disapprove
---
Nice Cosplay, I like Legion
---
how many krugs could fred krug if a fred could krug
---
I don't like Monitor and Abuse on her. 
---
Your set up is already pretty good, through.
---
She's literally rotting dude...
---
I just want to play Doctor with more than 5 fps...
---
I forgot to add a flair so they removed it chief
---
I just bought Freddy. I have faith in you BHVR.
---
[Here it is](https://i.imgur).com/hS4BN5Z.jpg
---
It's powerful on certain builds, while her Amulet and Wakizashi are really, *really* good on all builds.
---
I see
---
I don't. Camping isn't worth it. while you're here standing the rest can fix all gens and escape. camping in the end-game is fine, because there's nothing else to do anyway
---
Well that’s unfortunate, this seems like it would be a good way to stop farming. I feel like if we could do it during stage one, but not past that, it’d be a nice addition to the game. You’d be able to stop being farmed to struggle stage. Though once you’re on struggle stage it probably wouldn’t make sense to be able to do anything besides struggle, which is why I say only stage one
---
Fortnite?
---
Yikes Whispers. I hate Whispers on Spirit, you can't hear shit because of it. 
---
Imo, Surveillance completely out classes Whispers.
---
I hadn't seen this posted to Reddit so I decided to link and hopefully expose it more if it already was posted do correct me!
---
[All I could think about.](https://imgur.com/a/gLyOUzv)
---
Increasing it so the generator makes less noise would be cool. Or they could extend it to anyone on the same generator as you gets the effect. 
---
or both of these would make this perk miles better.
---
I'm used to playing with Whispers, so it doesn't really bother me.  
---
Surveillance is pretty meh imo.
---
Well I’m one of the lucky 500 so... I’m good thanks.
---
Oh ok sorry about that
---
Huh, I make low quality memes too.
---
It was a link to att search engine looking up the Acronym SWF.
---
why freddy is the worst killer in a nutshell
---
Well, actually, you only care about two hooks.
---
A totem counter isn't directly a counter to totem perks. Small Game and Map items *directly* show you where every single totem is located, a simple totem counter does not do that. 
---
A totem counter doesn't help you against any Hex perks except NOED. It still doesn't show you *where* the totems are, but it helps level the playing field between solo and SWF when dealing with NOED.
---
People really be out here stealing u/Mudmallow 's memes
---
It's fine.

I usually interpret gen rushing as when a swf group all bring tool boxes with add ons (usually brand new parts) to pop multiple gens in quick succession. Technically gen rushing is playing the game most effectively as survivor, 1 person distracts whilst 3 work on one gen each. This is the reason why ruin is so essential as killer since if survivors play optimally, the gens would be done too quickly.

cry me a river. Don't hold it you whiny slut. LUL
---
i like the idea of making it similar to Prove Thyself, maybe let it work on hooks/chests as well
---
How the fuck do you fail to protect Gens as the Plague
---
Oh I see. That doesn't really count because that's not actually the Battle Pass. They just lump it in together as a psychological trick against the pigeons.
---
Rotting hot
---
I don't see how an obvious error on Twitter is anything significant.  They've explicitly said chapters are killer + survivor + map and paragraphs are solo killer/survivor many, many more times than the supposed two examples you have.
---
i was just about to commemt the exact same thing mah man
---
How can’t you like the channel with great content such as 84 perk roulette videos or 12 trappers basement? He truly puts a lot of work into his content an example would be the totally not boring gameplay barely edited. And him explaining the perks even tho it’s the 12th video in the series and the majority already know the perks.
---
Monitor is good on her, you can't find hiding survivors while phasing anyway(I mean for the first time). So you can start a chase being really close to them. With M&amp;A her TR is only 16 meters and when she starts a chase she's a god.   
---
She's a really strong killer, so you only need ruin and the rest of perks is actually up to you. I think Save the best for last is really good on her. Beside that Make your choice, Nurse's calling, some people like Stridor(I stopped using it a while ago, you can get used to their normal groaning, ofc when sounds are okay and they are not right now).  I also recommend Pop goes the weasel ;)
---
same ... i did not still waiting for daddy myers
---
Youre completely ignoring the fact that someone from the actual dev team said that a chapter can refer to a solo survivor a few days ago.
---
3rd blink is always a free hit if you're good. As a Nurse main i think she absolutely should not have extra blink add ons.
---
This is the best I can do 
---

---
Then link it.  And a community manager is not a dev.
---
the only problem with these two perks is it takes way too activate both at once since it takes at least 6 hits to kill someone depending on decisive or mom or adrenaline and if the survivor is really good it may make dying light useless

What if I don't have one?

sounds great
---
Or that it should affect every person on the gen. If one uses it, other should have the effect too. Maybe not for failing skillchecks, because that could be a bit strong, but for the noise being lowered
---
Hag can teabag as well.
---
Throwback to when it did tho
---
Downing them right in front of the exit and putting a trap on them is so deliciously evil.
---
I bet the killer was a hag. my friend call her alien too
---
Really? Haven't played spirit in a while but I remember using sloppy for that exact reason lol. Might've just been me being stupid. I know there's an addon that makes scratchmarks dissapear but not the other way around. Probably my bad though

I find Whispers incredibly helpful to me whenever I use it, especially since EGC's been added.

---
Which you wouldn't get if the battle pass didn't exist.
---
I agree that the Mother Daughter Ring is a very powerful add-on, but I still think that the Amulet is one of her best add-ons as it gives you both chase potential and map pressure.
---
Just listen to Nurse/Freddy/Billy/Hag.
---
im not tryna play the game to win, im tryna play to have fun, and if im getting gen rushed its not fun, but i also like to try and see from the other side too
---
Have you tried going to a hook?
---
GoT is pretty mainstream now. I wouldn't really call it nerdy, unless pretty much everyone is a nerd.
---
I mostly agree with this except I’d place nurse and cannibal higher
---
The per game access idea I threw out doesn't exist, but I was pondering what if the producers of a game also set up a nominal fee to access their multiplayer content. 
---
I also pay for these "services" but I don't see it as ideal. Rather I tolerate them because capitalism has forced upon us the message that these huge companies who make so much money (yet still lay off their workers) need to get paid even more money. 
---
Obviously BHVR doesn't fall into this category as they aren't a AAA game maker, but this was a rant about so-called services and capitalism in gaming in general.
---
Ehh most swf’s I face just rush gens with toolboxes
---
Ok.  It breaches every norm BHVR has had for years, and he's new one, but it's still effectively going to be a paragraph.
---
it doesnt let me hook her

Is it effective?
---
Hmm, can you describe the scene?
---
Not true. At all. Don't pretend that you can't code this in without having to sell a BattlePass. Or are you suggesting that Epic, who makes a shit ton of money, can't provide free things to their fan base without having to have some other fans pay for it many times over first?

---
Last time I checked ever since April killers and survivors can use proximity chat with one another
---
me and the laurie were waiting for the endgame to happen and she slowly went out of a locker and then time went out. i kept her on my shoulder and the timer finished, and made me drop her. the animation didnt start, shes just lying on the ground still. when i swing , it acts like shes on my shoulder and she gets lifted from the ground
---
Just checked PlayStation Store, no sale :(
---
I guess I am biased towards Whispers, since I've been using it for so long.  
---
Still a good perk imo .-.
---
That’s a pretty good idea, yet I’m sure the people on this reddit will find a way to make it sound horrible.
---
Where did you find this?
---
1 year and a half
---
Or they could do both. Crazy i know. No reason why we cant have a battle pass and rewards for rank and devotion. You know actually encourage people to level up and rank up.
---
Ew, shit comment. Downvoted.
---
I'm happy when someone tries to 360 me because this always happens lol
---
I think legion could be mid tier depending on who you play as.
---
Boo fucking hoo. 
---
Many of us are sitting with maxed out characters, so there’s no point in playing anymore. The game is getting stale, and we need a new grind .
---
What's the point of playing the game, if not to get better at it?  
---
Using add-ons just takes a big part of the skill involved imo.  
---
Sure, I use add-ons on Billy or Huntress from time to time, but I try not to use anything too powerful; I usually just use add-ons to have more fun with the killer.
---
Uuuuuuhhhhhh maybe charge your controller??? Lmao
---
Monto 4k’d him with Freddy
---
I agree 100%. But the OP asked "why" if you look at the title, so this is my best guess as to why that decision was made. Unless it's completely unintentional? I honestly don't know anything about making a game, so maybe it was. But if this was a conscious decision to give survivors collision priority, then my answer remains the same.
---
I will admit... I do get the chase the shiny jitters when I see a legacy
---
no
---
Freddy B tier? Are you 11 years old?
---
Agreed. Old Legion I could run No Mither with Resilience and Spine Chill and just loop around the map. New Legion, loops don't last very long at all.
---
Ok so if you purchase a vehicle on top of paying the monthly note for this vehicle, you should then have free access to the insurance for the vehicle, satellite radio, extended warranty for the vehicle, free oil changes and maintenance, and free gas. Right? Is that how capitalism should work? You purchase a product, then are entitled to free services for the product?
---
I can imagine Huntress closing it by throwing a hatchet at it and the Doctor by using his electricity powers
---
Okay, so you want to date your mom? That's kinda sick :P
---
I know we sorta shit on the devs but you can tell they actually care about their game and put effort into balance, gameplay and atmosphere. They are good game developers.
---
Darn in Canadian
---
It was this way before the fix for me, but now I'm seeing it a lot more.
---
Before the most notorious offenders were when actually inside the exit gates or on Yamaoka bridges and occasionally at a window when a second survivor runs right up beside me, now it's just... Everywhere.
---
I've lost quite a few downs just because I can't lunge without a survivor bodyblocking me off course and running, sometimes multiple times a match, other times just when it really matters (like allowing someone to reach the gate or a pallet or when trying to stop someone from clearing a totem).
---
I agree. I'm just sick of hearing "tUnNeLiNg Is EfFiCiEnT". Like yeah you're right but is that survivor having any fun when you do that? When you kill a guy in less than 2 min is that fun? "Ohhhh but i'm winning so i'm having a fun" I think this idea of what "winning" is leads people to play like dicks. I guess it's not my place to define what 'fun' is to somebody and i will never tell anybody how to play. I just like to get players to put themselves in the other sides shoes. Have some empathy. And i think doing that and trying to define what 'fun' is to one's self simultaneously could really brighten this community a bit
---
You can play with me, fam! I won’t tunnel you. :3
---
This guy f\*cks
---
No Huntress is not my mother but she is my *mommy* ya feel me ;)
---
I don't know the perks, so it's good for me
---
Quality shit post lol
---
My question I never see answered is what does the killer list look like if all are forced to use only their three personal perks. Nurse would still be tops but after that it gets murky.
---
3 DCs? Oof, I would have let the guy go personally, but that’s just me being the merciful killer I am, lol
---
Those are all valid points ... but nothing in those clips would suggest that happened. Including the title of the thread. Do you not understand what  should have left means? 
---
We’re not talking about players that heal on the way out or take that last hit as they cross the barrier. 
---
Again, because this is the part that really matters, the end game was changed because survivors were NOT leaving the match when the gates were powered. Again, NOT leaving. TheSe are mainly SWF groups who just tormented this killer and get off on a It. They are assholes. 
---
Regardless, you don’t need to do a killer any favors that you outplayed. Unless you were farming together. I’ll give the hook if I maxed out my shit on a farming run. 
---
Actually, I take that back. You can do them a MASSIVE favor and leave the fucking match. 
---
This comes down to fair play in competition and there are some people who are just poor sports no matter if they win or lose. You know when they lose ... they DC. You’re defending toxic players.

Because I played as the killer for almost a year. I get this game. So when a killer makes a video that says should have left. I know what that means. Ive also played as a survivor and witnessed toxic play from that side as well ... I get it. I don’t think you do. 
---
Either you are defending toxic players, or don’t play enough to understand the context of this video and are posting off topic. 
---
You are literally arguing this from a losing position and don’t realize it. The end game was changed because of this type of play from survivors. It was enough of a problem to warrant a change and no good killer has a problem with a team healing at the gate they just chase them out and get a hit in.
---

If you make a post featuring other players in a negative light, censor all usernames. Shaming other players by name encourages harassment, drama, and witch-hunting. Absolutely no calls to actions against other players, such as mass reporting or blocking.

I got one a few days ago.
---
Why can't they balance consoles and PC separate like other games tend to do? I'm not sure why they haven't done that since they decided to do console ports after release anyway. That wouldn't be 1 sided and it would actually make sense to do considering.
---
The nurse is unfair, but she is a necessary evil in the current state of the game.  I would only support a nerf if they simultaneously bugged killers and solo survivors to in general all be on the same level as a depip squad.  Otherwise I’m fine with letting all the good players congregate at red ranks.
---
Ah, could have guessed I'm not the first one, just never seen it discussed. Well, now to wait for the stream!
---
I'd say empathy let's you know where survivors are, and at times, where the killer is. I run resilience as well, so instead of wasting 30 sec healing, I'm bossted 9% on a gen. With spine chill I can get 15% if Tim know the killer is in a chase nearby. Way better time spent instead of 30 of in the distance healing while the gen is lost likley regressing.
---
This is the entity 
---
Boi got dat Noed on
---
Look what e hookin on
---
This is the entity
---
One of the problems they were having with Freddy, and the reason why he got nerfed the first time around, was how he interacts with new players. How is a new player supposed to know that they have to fail skill checks without already knowing what Dream Demon does? Now, I do *not* think that the game should be balanced around level 20s, but a way to make him less RNG dependent while also making him easier to play against for people who might not know exactly how his ability works is to put a max duration cap on it and make it so failing a skill check simply removes a large amount of time from it without breaking it completely. Say that the base duration would be sixty seconds which doesn't go down while in a chase, and that failing a skill check removed 20-30 seconds off of that.
---
I already did mate I use make your choice instead

PC controller users will be fine because they all tend to switch to kb+m if they play Nurse now generally, at least all the controller users I know that play Nurse will. Cross-platform play is a nice-to-have that shouldn't force an imbalance just because it may exist in the future.
---
Probably don't make your game so grindy to begin with, or price your cosmetics at a better price so people will actually pay for them. 
---
But of course they are here to make money, so you pay them for the privilege to grind for even more items, most of which you probably don't even want.

---
how to communicate in solo queue, teabag quickly with any survivors you spawn with (this is a greeting butt dance), if a survivor fucks up a skill check and the killer did not bring ruin get off gen and stare into their face (this signifies that their sins are known and the survivor council stands in judgement), teabagging the killer when you pallet stun them (this says "im an asshole") , teabagging quickly in a short burst as or towards an injured survivor (let me heal you/heal me)
---
Not really. It took me about 10 min in KYF to 4k with not much trouble. I was using vanilla Nurse too.

If you wouldn't have used the remake Freddy everything would be fine.

---
I am Atomic Wheeze, and I approve of this message
---
&gt;I'm not disputing any kind of "legitness". What I am disputing is this weird notion that facecamping and tunnelling is provoked based on a tactical understanding of how to defeat the Surviviors, **rather it's just based on the Survivior slighting the killer in any way.** ***And more often than not, the Survivior slighting that killer didn't do anything wrong. They tried to survive, and there's nothing wrong with that.***
---
Sure sounds like an absolution to me. You said it's not the survivors fault, they didn't do anything wrong.
---
You really don't give unbreakable enough credits, using it along with discord communication means that if your whole team gets slugged, you can get back up. 
---
Sure, the killer can try counter this by hooking people; but will create the issue of him wasting so much time to make sure someone stays down, ultimately making it hard topressure more than one survivor at a time
---
When you are doing a gen and peekaboo Myers scares the shit out of you "Hello There"
---
I said that 4 months ago when they started.

It's really not the end of the world

You shouldn’t get banned maybe if it’s so bad it looks like your lag switching but it’s pretty unfair to the survivors even tho it’s not your fault.

Hex: Memeless mode.  Come join me! :)
---
I don't know why you think trying to swing your epeen around is a good arguing tactic but i've literally played since beta and have 600+ hours, when you play long enough you stop giving a shit about people staying a little too long and stop reading into every little thing as some intentional fuck you from survivors because at the end of the day it's just a game and i've played hundreds upon hundreds of them, so who cares even if some little shit is trying to be cute in this one game and bm me or something. The way people talk about dbd makes me think they've never played any other competitive multiplayer game before if you really get pissy over someone standing at the exit gate border for 30 seconds and letting you hit them out as an unforgivable offense to your character or something. The endgame doesn't even apply here, the survivors were in the gate for less than 20 seconds and it takes 3 minutes for the timer to kill them.
---
Just because you don't like the memes doesn't mean other people don't enjoy them and that they're making this subreddit worse. I've seen people that genuinely enjoy them
---
Make a better build. It's a shit build that gets bailed out by noed. I mean seriously, Nurse's on a Pig?

That's why sometimes you don't do fakes and sometimes you do them and yea in a way ur right cause if it's a god nurse then ur screwed but come on how often do you get that kind of people even at rank 1.

Op is either a troll, or has the self restraint and emotional control of a toddler

---
Yea people need to chill, not everyone's going to always win.

Exactly. I want as many perks as possible to become useful which I believe is definitely achievable.
---
Ive thought about maybe for every x seconds on a gen gain a token. And if you mess up a skillcheck it consumed it. Also maybe less chance of a skill check, could be useful to counter ruin
---
This was very oddly satisfying. More please.

A pass that you buy with real money that lets you grind for things over a set period of time. It’s called a battlepass because it became most famous by Fortnite who gives players that buy the pass skins and stuff if they grind to do the whole thing. 
---
You’re essentially paying for the opportunity to earn rewards which aren’t guaranteed to you if you don’t grind.
---
I love the gap between how polite it is to teabag at fellow survivors (unless they're hooked) and how rude it is to teabag at the killer.
---
Please devs I Just wanted my adept achievements
---
Lol no prob. Oh yeah Hag would be high no question but there’s also always a chance she has 0 perks about 5 minutes into the game lol.
---
I remember a shoddy(she wasn't that bad) legacy nurse play against no0b3 in one video. I wonder if that was you.
---
Kinda sad we don't have this kind of killer menu...
---
That was amazing
---
It is just with Ash
---
I don’t have to swing my epeen around  on a message forum because my real one is big enough to not care. You may be projecting on that one ... I’m not attacking. I realize there are people who will spend hours going back and forth on this forum and just waste time. 
---
I’m just not one of them. Especially for such a cut and dry topic like this one. I’ve acknowledged his points and have admitted their validity...
---
But that’s not the case here and arguing that it is, is just dumb when you understand the context of it. 
---
You’re missing the point of the video and my defense of it. I wouldn’t even be mentioning it if the developer didn’t fundamentally change the end game because of it. 
---
That’s great you have 600+ hours in this game. I have more then that just on PS4 and I also own on Xbox and now PC. The amount of time played doesn’t concern me. You either get it or you don’t and if you don’t have an open mind ... chances are you don’t.
---
I was wondering why are the sounds oddly satisfying but I think I have the answer to my question now
---
I always say don't care and still give a gg
---
That moment when you are running a healer build and find out it's the plague.
---
Why would he t-bag there? He’s nowhere near the escape line. What an idiot
---
Props for not just immediately face camping her.
---
As a recent Balanced Landing convert, I have to say it’s by far my favorite exhaustion perk. I never bothered until just a few weeks ago, and now, I love it. No more saving up Sprint Burst, and no more not being able to use Lithe because of window hitboxes. Of course it doesn’t always happen, but many of the drop points are centrally located in the map, making BL a great perk that lets you be confident cranking out that risky middle gen early in the game. 
---
I find that compared to others, I get more killers to whiff an attack as we drop, before they realize I have it. Not to mention, many killers, after realizing I have it, will wait below at the drop point with me above, giving me precious time to heal or regain Exhaustion. Surprisingly, killers often just give up on me in that position and as a survivor who admittedly isn’t great in a chase, it’s saved me countless times. And I love getting up high, getting a good view of a killer hooking someone, watching where they go, and dropping down in for a swift save.
---
Dead Hard isn’t bad either. However, once you get to purple/red ranks, most killers expect it and wait to swing anyway. Sure, it takes some time to memorize all the good drop points for the maps, but once you know them, I feel like it’s hard to beat BL.
---
*Happy oink intensified*

I feel like a terrible person cuz I haven't been doing this. I am sorry.
---
All perks are a form of "crutch"
---
#long arm joe
---
His lunge range feels like this some times.
---
It's never too late to become a better you
---
So:
---
-I’m glad we’ve got the classic duo of Mathieu and not_queen back.
---
-I love how they’re not even trying to hide who the next killer is- they know we know, so there’s no reason to keep it hidden anymore.
---
-This also sadly confirms that we aren’t getting a new survivor, and probably not even a new map- otherwise, why just call it ‘Ghostface’?
---
Literally the worst thing you could ever do. Time to farm them.
---
I got this on my very first red mori, as doctor all those years ago, people DC’ed less then.
---
I use Ruin, BBQ, Monitor/Enduring/Franklins occasionally, and surveillance. 
---
Monitor is good to sneak up on people. I’m a big fan of prayer beads.  I know enduring seems useless because she’s meant to be anti loop but I’m not afraid to hit people through pallets, or if my power bar isn’t ready yet. Franklins because, well, fuck your toolbox.  Ruin, obviously.  And 
---
Surveillance might be the best perk for her. Nothing is more satisfying than being mid chase and breaking Chase to sneak up on people.  
---
She’s great for map pressure and protecting gens so pop is good, discordance, surveillance. I suggest getting one of the three in your build.
---
when in doubt just role out Ole reliable
---
Just after a game where I hooked people in the basement and let them get away. Hmmm.
---
i'm interested in helping. How would you like the media/information collated and sent to you?
---
lol what a dumbass he wasn't even close enough
---
I had this happen to me. I pressed the button to drop her right as the killing began, assuming she would die. We ended up waiting until she DC’d.
---
What a smart post to make. People like you shouldn't be playing if they can't control their anger in the first place.
---
Ghost face is right there in the description, they're not even bothering to hide it anymore. Though I suppose today is the day the reveal was scheduled for.
---
Then speak with your wallet. Not rocket science.
---
He knows when to crack stupid jokes, he’s really enjoyable
---
I don't know, but I'm sure he'll learn to not BM. I wasn't even being scummy and camping anyone or anything, but sometimes people just like to be toxic for one reason or another.
---
On PC and Ingame:
---
If you fail a sabo skill check on a hook the sabo progress sometimes stops progressing even after the penalty from the failed skill check is over. (Only tested this with a toolbox)
---
I think it happens when you fail a skill check and then immediately press right click again. You can keep saboing after you get a skill check. (I think)
---
This select screen looks sick. Why did they change it
---
In German it's Hügelwilhelm (like the Kaiser)
---
Repost because I don't know how to reddit, this site is too normie for me.
---
i play survivor and killer, and i hate the sounds he makes. when i hear them i feel like punching my screen
---
How can I help?
---
I think it would be cool to make it so the first missed skill-check has a 100% chance of silencing the explosion, and it becomes 50% from then on. Might not sound impressive, but I feel like it would do a lot psychologically for the survivor trying to hit hex skill checks.
---
isn’t the fourth one pestilence not conquest?
---
I wanna buy the Pig just tp do this
---
Yes.
---
Finally, a tier list that's actually good
---
A  double t-bag while working on a gen can also mean Michael is staking us, get away asap
---
Bring up some solid points here.  So the trend I’m seeing is he’s a low-grade Billy, which I can totally see.  
---
I swear I’ve been able to survive against Billy more than the Cannibal though, his chainsaw swings making him go faster is just a bitch to deal with.  I’m also not a god tier survivor so that probably plays some into it as well haha
---
This looks more like the "Please don't eat my ass, spirits" guy than Freddy.
---
I heavily approve of this
---
Bubbas only saw me because I'm a idiot and run into a wall. You only have to go around a corner quick enough and his saws done.
---
I know. I just wanted too know.
---
Billy's a lot more popular than Leatherface, and not everyone's going to be a skilled Killer, so it might be confirmation bias. But there's a reason the most popular Killer in red ranks is Billy. Not as skill-intensive as Nurse or Spirit nor as situational as Huntress or Hag.
---
I'll never understand how people have allowed themselves to be OK with the further monetization of services, features, and goods that used to come standard with monetary transactions.
---
Thanks! Do u know what else can be my problem?
---
Cannibal's chainsaw is really good in open spaces and really bad in tight ones. Hugging objects and vaulting away from him completely negate his whole saw, especially because charging it slows him down.
---
Sprint burst just nullifies bubba if you have somewhat map knowledge. He's by far the easiest killer to loop in this game
---
Freddy can yeet you out of the real world and put you in his dream world though
---
I’ll keep that in mind, thanks!
---
I did not account for 15 other scenarios too
---
Rank 15 isn’t good but that doesn’t mean anything. You’ll eventually get the hang of it.  Keep map pressure! Keep rushing people.  Pig is so much fun to play as but isn’t the best for sacrifices on sacrifices.  Might I suggest Spirit, Nurse or Billy.    But keep oinking away
---
If he starts going after you, get to an area with lots of objects and hug them as you run. Either he takes a tighter path and risks bashing his saw or he takes a looser path amd can't keep up.
---
I use BBQ, STBFL, Shadowborn, and Discordance as my main perks.
---
Move speed and charge speed add-ons with STBFL can end chases really quickly.
---
Shadowborn because I hate default FOV. But it also works wonders on Spirit as I catch survivors I wouldn't have otherwise and I phase right on them being surprised.
---
I don't like Monitor on Spirit as I like to have a consistent terror radius with her. I sometimes barely leave my 24 meter terror radius on gens to grab people while I chase others (it works well with Discordance) too. But Monitor gets big and smaller and that can really screw with gen grabs and even chases. Then the FOV sliding up and down gives me a headache too so I have no reason to use Montior over Shadowborn.
---
Same face you make when you realize it's that same survivor who's on the hook
---
I spent so much time brainstorming on this and yet it’s that obvious haha thank you my dude!
---
what is a soul?
---
well I mean replication is an honest form of flattery
---
Sure? Whether you said it before was irrelevant to me, though I understand the need to explain. I was really just curious what you meant.
---
Yep, thats definitely just a scummy way to play. I just know some people actually consider even playing certain killers scummy which makes no sense.
---
It says this somewhere in the game I'm not sure where but it's pretty easy to find
---
Pour one out for the poor souls that earned Legacy and then lost it with absolutely no chance of ever getting it back.
---
Excellent, thank you! As soon as you open a chest, the interface will show a thumbnail of the item within and any add-ons it may have. Take a screenshot (I recommend using Lightshot, a free program that allows you to quickly select the area of the screen you wish to screenshot and save it fast). You can host all screenshots on an Imgur album and send me the link.
---
I can't check right now, so would you happen to know if items have a chance to come with add-ons even without AITH equipped? (yes, it has been waaay too long since I played survivor). u/Worge105
---
Agreed. So many people get too nervous not being healed, because they can't last more than 20 seconds in a chase. From what I've noticed, usually the people who run self care would rather hide and stay hidden, because they can't run around as much. And the issue with hiding, is the killer finds you wayy less often, meaning your teammates are the ones being found, so they have all the pressure applied to them, they feel like they're being tunneled, and it leads to games where the same guy gets hooked and killed right away instead of spreading out who's getting hooked, ultimately leading to less people making it out. Plus as a killer, I'd much rather have someone loop me for a while rather than me spending most of the map searching for the brown pant brown shirt claudette hiding in the corner, downing her within 20 seconds, and repeating
---
Its no problem. We've all been there!
---
I haven't seen any recent video of this. I had no idea the mechanic was broken.
---
Kawaiidesune
---
I recently started back playing and I’ve realized that the thing to do is bring the killer to your direction. Bitches.
---
Her secret power is to extend her hitbox several meters to get a hit
---
Fair enough.
---
Hey if it was up to me I'd kill the entire bloodweb. I don't have a ton of time to spend on video games so I get the grind. Hell I never play games like Diablo because I just don't have the hours to poor into the grind. I really like the spirit, but I don't have half the perks on her I'd like.
---
But I bought this game 3 years ago and have picked up each of the dlc's (except Ash) . And this entire time the bloodweb has been the standard, so if I can get a free way to catch up- awesome. Sure they would delete the entire blood web and give every character all the perks, but part then it brings in 'whoa I prestige 3 every character where's my compensation, why does he get everything?' there's no winning. So I'll take my free stuff.
---
Worse. Again, potato. I know it's the the minimum requirements, but whatev.
---
I have never seen an item come with add-ons without AITH (Ace In The Hole).
---
My wife and i will grab some screenshots this weekend and i'll throw up them up on imgur. Would you like a DM or just a response to this thread?
---
I feel like a simple point would work better
---
He's fun after a few games getting used to him. He will be reworked soon, getting revealed next week on stream. If you are thinking of getting him I would wait until they reveal what he does so you know what you are getting into.
---
Yeah it's cool to have someone think its good enough to steal, but on the other hand the repost got more upvotes than mine did
---
Although karma dont mean jack shit so I dont really care, just wanted credit for my creation lmao
---
bummer. sorry mate, you may have just unlocked the SOL perk in your bloodweb
---
Yep. O o f
---
It really does help his case when the argument is that DBD only calls DLC 'chapter' when it's got killer + survivor + map, and yet this is now multiple instances of DBD team saying that a 'chapter' can be just one character.
---
You can say she was wrong, but she's part of the DBD team and you aren't, so her words hold more weight.
---
Wraith watching peeps with david attenborough
---
Personally, I just don't find him interesting to play as. I'd rather play more strategic killers like Freddy and pig, play mind games with clown and spirit, or huntress with her satisfying shots.
---
The old hatch mechanic was broken. But it doesn’t necessarily reward failure. You’re alive. Your teammates aren’t. Did you really fail if you’re still alive or did your teammates fail?
---
The problem is if you play the meta killers to compete against them, then you will only end up going against even more skilled/tryhard survivors.
---
Luul. What response were you reading?
---
Keep chugging, stable genius.
---
Yeah I ran into one the other day who just chased one survivor around for like 7 minutes while us other 3 survivors finished all the gens and then all got out and others who put him to good use.  
---
I’ll keep sprint burst in mind, right now I’m going through all the survivors getting them to 50 to get everyone’s teachable perks unlocked
---
If that's true, then by all means use AITH, as we might even be able to make statistics about the rarity of the add-ons that show up!
---
Whichever method to send the results is fine.
---
I'm on PS4 tho, is that a problem? I can take the screenshots and transfer them to my PC and do the Imgur thing there. I can crop it to only show the thumbnail.
---
The only thing I've found is on the Wiki. On the Chests page it doesn't talk about Add-Ons, but on the Add-Ons page it has a "Add-Ons from Chests" paragraph that says:
---
*Using the Perk Ace in the Hole, a Survivor will find Items  with Add-ons attached to them.*
---
So I guess thats only possible with AITH. I also don't remember ever looting an add-on from a Chest without AITH.
---
The match had just started maybe 1 or 2 minutes ago, and nobody was BMing each other (however Dwight did go for an unhook right in front of me, resulting in his chase)
---
They probably felt deep down you were using noed and didn’t want to play with a talentless player. It’s tough but it be like that
---
i wish they didn’t. i’m a leatherface main and i never camp, i get a bad rep though because of most other leatherfaces do it
---
I watch FunGoose, JenDenise, and Zubat. They're all extremely skilled.
---
Love this. I can still hear the pickles.
---
Yeah that's a good idea. Other than that I know when I play leatherface people narrowly escape a lot with window vaults and stunning me with pallets while I saw. Just practice a little. I get into some matches with him and never touch anyone with his saw.
---
Yes here and there on PS4, happens about 1-2 times a week. Weird bug and then after they are healed and get injured again, I can heal them.
---
I find nurse too hard to play, how about we get her reworked too?
---
The only killer I truly hate, because of the GD head trap.
---
I started playing this game on the 25th of november 2016, 1 day after the legacy deadline🙂
---
Keep blaming other people for you losing.
---
Now we’re talking
---
To be quite honest, he probably DC’d out of sheer embarrassment of his mistake, I would likely have done the same not gonna lie
---
Honestly that's just fine. Games (especally still releasing new content/balance/rework/new dedicated servers/maps/ ect...) all cost money. Lots of money.
---
So if they want to release paid content that people can get to keep the lights on? Cool. If somehow I benefit from it for free? Super Cool.
---
I personally like deliverance over adrenaline, since lately I've been running into a lot of killers using NOED. I think the perks you gave are certainly strongest, but I like having my mettle ready for when the end game starts, and the killer has NOED. Adrenaline causes you to be full health when NOED would activate, meaning mettle wouldn't work
---
Okay... I guess...?
---
smol billy
---
Ignore him. He plays only 1 side and it shows.
---
I take it you got up there with your exhaustion Perks?
---
As a dumbass that misses his skillcheck a bit more often than he should, I find that 50% chance of not letting all of China knows that I'm here pretty useful.
---
They say people go to a place of peace before taking their own life. Dwight knew what he had to do.
---
Yea it sucks
---
Then by all means use AITH, as we might even be able to make statistics about the rarity of the add-ons that show up! :)
---
Yes, PS4 screenshots should be fine.
---
Just lean into it. Throw a pallet down and run away.
---
Fam, wait til you gonna pick up Ash
---
Holding the unhook until your hands grab onto it is the universal "HE'S CAMPING ME" sign, spam clicking is the "they're gone come get me oh god please before I hit phase two or I\['m gonna ram my fist where the sun don't shine"
---
Also, "tunneling" is both effective, and how you rank up, based on the emblem system's requirements.
---
There is also a difference between a killer who won't touch anyone, regardless of anything, to get to you, and someone who chooses you over another target.
---
It's always fun to see shitposts about garbage tier perks and read the comments as people try to describe the niche scenarios in which their favored garbage tier perk is useful.
---
The problem i see off the top with that is if he has to just sleep you once for the entire match what would be the point in the devs making us sleep anyone at all.
---
In what way? There are zero places to hide and a half blind horse could follow the blood trails/scratch marks directly to a survivor. And if you're up against a nurse, ho boy.
---
This game and subreddit has the most people playing it that don't understand the theme of what a competitive game is. They really shouldn't be playing it or most multiplayer video games online tbh
---
It's 2.6 seconds, it's really not work it :c
---
players often do this because it had the potential to bug out the killer. it doesn't any longer, but some still do it
---
I’m a killer main, a rank 1 killer main who doesn’t need to use crutch perks. Keep relying on crutch perks to get kills.
---
Its really like the SaW movies. You nearly sacrifice your Arm and all you get is a puppet laughing at you.
---
The fact that nearly every single pallet is safe. It's so easy to loop in.
---
I just didn't know the lingo, been playing with a tight group of friends mostly or as killer mostly.
---
Look at that shit. Four columns, four rows. You don't even need to scroll down to select a Killer with this.
---
I’m only here for the Golden Girls figures at the bottom of the pic. 
---
Also, congrats!
---
How the fuck are you guys doing this on a controller
---
Is it worth reading?
---
Here’s a thought. 
---
Don’t go after the Dwight again.
---
A spirit can be... A ghost... Or just some kind of non-physical beings that is not necessarily human
---
A ghost is a human that got butthurt so instead of going away he stayed to annoy people
---
I see you run Monitor &amp; Abuse, but would Shadowborn work as well? I have the hardest time trying to see shit while crouched, and the bonus FOV seems really nice to have.
---
I'd imagine their main thought is "they must've hacked legacy"
---
Not even close. Alert, Lithe, BT, and unbreakable.
---
Someone who knows Freddy, how rare. 
---
Freddy isn't weak, but he needs the rework, because he's a pain to play against.
---
Same with my Shirtless Myers on Haddonfield, but they swing there arms allot when they are on the hook and I’m walking away not sure if there waving bye to me or not...
---
And a Wraith is a manifestation of a spirit that’s alive but a body that’s dead? Or am I completely off?
---
It's worse when you have TTV in your name, they go into your channel and copy paste their "your ugly and i hate your voice" line **every time**. No matter how you look like or sound like; you could be Brad Pitt and they will still say it.
---
Misery loves company and they just want to bring you down to their level. Don't let it, ignore and keep going.
---
If you have three or four alt accounts it still works, you actually can upvote more than twice in that case, but don't quote me on that, I still have to run some more tests.
---
Woah woah woah. Enjoyment?
---
Sure, I'll run my Santa David build, it's always fun.
---
Should I just gather screenshots until you ask for the album? How are we going to do it?
---
Nobody cares what rank you are. I play this game for fun. I use the perk because it's an exciting endgame surprise and it has a cool name.
---
I see this as an absolute win !
---
When endgame collapse starts the game becomes so bad I don't even get upset I just straight stand still till survivors leave.
---
Jokes on the survivors... Teabag in front of me and flashlight me all you want l.... I CANT SEE.
---
I almost never run away. Unless it’s the start of a match and the killer probably hasn’t found someone to chase
---
I literally just watched volume 1 an hour ago before seeing this wtf
---
Exactly! It’s fun when you get it to work to your advantage!
---
How is that selfish though? I really dislike matches where my shitty teammates take me on a ride through the tunnel. It's already equally as bad as if someone were to kick you away everytime.
---
4900 points? how can a killler get such low bp gain
---
2 of those are meta, and the other 2 are both really good. NOED is B tier at best. it’s not even that hard to counter. i am a higher survivor rank than i am killer rank, and NOED is easy as shit to counter.
---
/r/buildapc
---
They pointed this out in the last stream they know that's a thing, but are not sure what's causing it, the are working on it
---
Tip #1-don’t
---
It needs a buff on the exit game times!
---
Just looked it up, the extra 15 degree FOV seems nice. Sadly the FOV bonuses don't stack. I'd like the 15 degree from Shadowborn but I love the terror radius effects from M&amp;A so I'd personally stick with that.
---
leatherface relies on an open map + on the survivor being bad. If the survivor knows what they are doing, well, leatherface will have no power. I'd say aim at getting normal attack hits and only use the chainsaw when you know that the survivor has no chance of escaping
---
Stop shitting in the tall grass, I keep having to wipe my boots off!
---
Since plenty of people asked I currently have 4,673 hours on Dead by Daylight. I have been playing since late July 2016.
---
This is clearly a tier list based on the killer's ability to crush your head between her sexy Russian thighs. Spirit and trapper should be higher, despite not being Russian.
---
I'd recommend watching HybridPanda, chill dude who doesn't play toxic, teaches about the game as well as playing killer and survivor, changes his build to try new things all the time.
---
There’s a Dwight in this picture?
---
but your fair is noed..
---
Asking the real questions.
---
Not Pig, pig.
---
Last game I played was against a Spirit, saw a hex totem and didn't get it... guess who got one hit from devour hope... it be like that sometimes
---
It’s meant to be ironic
---
A nord's last thoughts should be of home.
---
No you go to the ledge and it pulls you up
---
I totally agree, read the comment below &lt;3
---
I'm the same as my username is my YouTube and real name, its sad that people go that far to hate when just playing the game
---
I’m a simple man, i see pig, i upvote.
---
oh ok
---
He was just going to his home to die.
---
Oh OK, thanks
---
Rorik-shed.
---
Hey, this reminds me of the whole "Made me own map" meme that happened quite a while ago
---
I don't know, you normally have a lot of paragraphs between chapters. Unless it's a poetry book.
---
The enitity works in mysterious ways.
---
Screw Vanity Mirror! It slows you down when it tier 2 and you can’t catch anyone just stick with scratched Mirror, I get 4k all the time.
---
Because they rely on survivors not finding the ruin
---
&gt;Live design  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Nightmare rework
---
We're so close, ladies, gents, and Legion mains...
---
Out of curiosity, why did you blur names in last clip?
---
“WhAt Do YoU mEaN ‘lEfT bEhInD’ iS tRaSh?!  75% bOnUs RePaIr FoR eAcH gEn LeFt Is Op!”
---
Thanks man.
---
Idk i kinda like to suffer.
---
I think he was referencing Dr. Loomis when talking about Michael Myers.
---
Why would i play this game if i don’t enjoy playing it...
---
Leatherface is bottom tier at best, he has no way to apply pressure and he can be countered by not being bad
---
Oh he's gonna learn. Learn to BM closer to the line. This person doesn't stop bming they just practice their craft until it becomes an art form
---
Jokes on you I get a pink/purple key out of a chest 25-30% of the time with Plunderer’s and now I know where hatch it &gt;:0
---
&gt; Should I just gather screenshots until you ask for the album? How are we going to do it?
---
That's a great idea. Given how crappy my wi-fi has been it might be a few weeks until I can get enough screenshots myself. If you're gonna use Plunderer's Instinct I might as well start gathering screenshots without it for comparison.
---
Just make his m1 an insta down too. Add a few roadspikes he can put down to injure survivors which are almost impossible to see and make him really fast since it’s hard to catch up when they loop. Boom he becomes c tier.
---
People consider Freddy too weak? I thought he was pretty good.
---
wake up is pretty good. Especially during end game because if ur last, u gotta pick a door and 15% will definately change the fact if you are surviving or not.
---
My friend did this and I can’t stop laughing at and I don’t know why😂
---
It didj t let me post the image
---
When I play as him ... I don’t care about hooking anyone. I play him like the movies as best as I can. Ill pop out of a tree and then try to disappear and leave. 
---
I like to be scary and unpredictable and have you in the edge of your seat. I want you to escape, I just want it to be as terrifying as possible.
---
If you don't have BBQ &amp; Chili, it's almost worth to get Leatherface just for that one perk.  None of the killers you mentioned are really above mid tier, so it's hard to recommend one over the other.  Though Jumpscare Myers still seems like one of the funniest builds I've ever seen, but it's entirely add-on and offering reliant.
---
I've barely played Legion or Plague so it's hard for me to suggest picking one or the other.
---
Nice, I'll do my screenshots, transfer them to a folder after every session and I'll upload them to Imgur when you ask for them.
---
If I'm not mistaken Plunderer's Instinct also increases chances of rarer items. If this is the case, there should be 4 different fields of data:
---
-Standard
---
-Plunderer's Instinct
---
-Ace In The Hole
---
-Plunderer' Instinct + Ace In The Hole
---
Is that right? Or am I trippin?
---
In order of most recommended:
---
1. Spirit 
---
2. Hag 
---
3. Doctor 
---
4. Myers
---
5. Leatherface (for the perks)
---
6. Clown
---
7. Plague
---
8. Legion
---
9. Freddy
---
Never thought I’d see someone get so pressed. 
---
Relax, kid. It’s the internet.
---
Who’s your friend who likes to play? *elephant noises in the background*
---
Yeah I haven’t gotten AITH unlocked yet but I’ve been farming items/BP on Kate for a week or more as I level her to unlock all the perks I currently have since I’m P3.  About 50 levels left before I’ll start leveling the last 5 survivors I need to get their perks.
---
Opinions are nice but you'll never change mine, not with that kind of upside down logic... and considering how shit this community is, I don't feel bad about D/Cing... I've been trolled enough in most games to realize being nice doesn't get you anywhere.
---
The best part about the game is honestly ruining someones fun who's trying to ruin yours... simple as that really.
---
I don't want his ugly ass. The day I fund a Pedophile is the day hell freezes over
---
Someone got the refrence!
---
This is one of the best things I ever saw.
---
I think it's the Pighead. Have you tried roaring at them as well? Or maybe putting a friendly decal on the head?
---
With the insane amount of money companies are making and still deciding to lay off large numbers of their employees, there appears to be quite a disconnect.
---
Hi, i main spirit/freddy. This is my current build
---
•BBQ&amp;C
---
•Whispers
---
•Pop goes the weasel
---
•Perk of your choice (i switch between franklins, nurse's calling, sloppy butcher and monitor and abuse. You can run any perk you want)
---
Explanations:
---
•BBQ is great on any killer with mobility, and spirit can travel pretty fast while phase walking. It helps you apply pressure really well, and it grants you extra bloodpoints!
---
•Whispers is great on all killers, it helps you build momentum at the start of the match really quickly. It can be used in the early, mid and late game.
---
•Pop goes the weasel sounds like an odd choice, but regressing 20 seconds off a generator is really, really good, specially in mobile killers.
---
•You can run any perk you want here, but i'm going to tell you which perks you shouldn't run on her:
---
  •Hex: Ruin; Please don't downvote me for this, but ruin is pretty mediocre except on set-up killers (Hag and Trapper). It can be destroyed in the first minute of the match, leaving you with only 3 perks. You can use perks like corrupt intervention, which is great combined with whispers, or pop goes the weasel, which is one of my favorite perks. Plus, spirit can already end chases quickly, meaning that she can apply pressure like a beast.
---
 •Stridor and Predator: Might be a good choice on beginner spirits, but when you get better, these perks will confuse you more than they would benefit you.
---
I have also had this with generators and toolboxes.
---
Shirtless David = mustn't be killed under any circumstances.
---
He panicked
---
Unbreakable is pretty bad.
---
A killer doesn't even have to run a slug build - BBQ&amp;C will reveal the downed survivors and the recovery period is long enough they'll probably hook three of their slug targets.
---
All they have to do is just keep track of who they downed first and therefore who was closest to recovery.

He wasn't the pedophile, the director was.  And I don't believe the director owns the licensing rights to him.
---
Excuse me, but i think Ruin is a bad choice on spirit, since she already can put pressure with her power as she can end chases quickly and travel fast, and it can be destroyed or ignored, rendering it useless
---
L2?
---
Bing*
---
Do some research on an actual Wraith in early Mesopotamian cultures. You’ll have proper nightmare fuel for weeks.
---
There are 3 different Mori Offerings.  Ebony, Ivory and Cypress.  Cypress allows the last Survivor to be Mori'd, Ivory allows a one time use for any Survivor to be Mori'd as long as they've been hooked.  Ebony Mori allows you to Mori every Survivor as long as they've been Hooked.
---
There is also the Perk, Hex Totem: Devour Hope that if you get 5 Stacks that you can Mori everyone regardless if they've been hooked or not, at the risk the Totem gets cleansed/destroyed or you fail to get stacks.
---
i think he realized he didn’t have time
---
You’re a fucking loser uninstall your life
---
Oh dont be negative my dude.
---
As I said, I play this game for fun. NoED is not an instant win, nor do I feel like I need to win every match. It's mere existence forces survivors to cleanse the totems (which is easy, and gives them BP) making the match last longer, making it more fun. And when they don't cleanse the totems, which is very uncommon, who's fault is that?
---
Salt/toxicity is incredibly stressful, who would find fun in that? Sounds like you do, honestly...
---
You're incredibly angry over nothing. Who hurt you?
---
I’m not going to lie, I completely forgot that Quentin exists. Now I’m sad that I could’ve spent less time thinking of something when the sleep deprived answer was right under my nose
---
Seems fair enough assessment to me
---
YOU FACE JARAXXUS, MEME-DESTROYER OF THE TIER LIST SHITPOSTS
---
I am a hardcore original Halloween fan. Like...just the first movie.
---
Hag would be terrible.  Her food is so red I could mistake it for still being alive
---
Not even funny tbh. Kinda wanna petition tier lists.
---
Myers is one of the killers I actually enjoy playing against because he is one of a few that genuinely jump scare me. Him and the spirit.
---
I'm expecting ghostface to be another one that joins them in the jump scare factor.
---
I never ran killer til i had mine at 34 so he could be a legit rank 19.
---
Well, idk if he could or not
---
I think hundreds would be higher because she hunts and cooks food ..... and people but still most of it is animal meat
---
Fair enough! I mostly just meant if you’re having to level up other Killers to get teachables for the build or anything :) Good luck with him!
---
Deerstalker, overcharge, the trapper perk (something presence) and distressing
---
Spirit is a very good killer, fun to play as. Her teachable perks are good too. 
---
I'd recommend that one c:
---
yeah, a disappearing sword is SO boring
---
Should you have posted that:
---
No---&gt;◐&lt;---No but in white
---
Thats.. really sad lol
---
Thanks for the feedback! I might try the second build, tho the late game Freddy sounds fun, despite hating noed haha
---
Make the fence the killer and the ball the pallet and this is me every time
---
Nobody said the same couldn’t be said about killers. It’s the fact that you had to post it as if this guy making a meme about what he experienced is an attack on your character
---
spirit seems to be the new DC killer since legion is a little better to handle.
---
Freddy and nurse are in a similar boat. They are hard to learn, and strong once learned (nurse =mechanical, Freddy=strategy). Somehow everyone is willing to learn one and not the other.
---
Freddy does need a rework of sorts, but only because he's a pain to go against as survivor.
---
the big difference was me sleeping him after 10 secs
---
Yeah I know the sleep is a major detriment, didn’t think about that
---
I’d kill to play this version
---
 That's fair, but I wanted to use him because he is the one we got in DBD
---
Honestly, I can't tell if you're making fun of me or the guy I'm making fun of.
---
Regardless, Billy needs to be able to toss his 2nd chainsaw, then he'll be mid tier.
---
You’re dense af
---
Maybe when &gt;!Ghostface!&lt; comes out
---
Those cosmetics are always there unless BHVR pulls them...Battle Passes are timed and have you grind out or pay out to advance it to the stuff you want. Long as you have a job...you can always pick a day/week to buy something and no,predatory tactic with Fear Of Missing Out FOMO where you pay to make SURE you get those tantalizing rewards at the end of the Pass...
---
Here's a video of me bullying a poor defenseless bing bong boi who just wanted one friend to stay for his basement sleepover party, please upvote.
---
Like fucking hell mate, you're pure distilled concentrated evil.
---
it can help with spirit as sound right now is buggy. you think they are in front of you and you come out to swing and nope they were on the other side of a small wall.
---
And I thought freddy had an ugly face.
---
Didn't know they gave huntress a lazer pointer.
---
Not like I'm complaining or anything.
---
No worries, I got everyone basically maxed :D lots of hours as a survivor haha
---
Was playing Bubba for a chainsaw quest and got shit on by a survivor because he got hooked during EGC and then farmed off, and DCed on hook. Dropped off such great one liners as "Bubba only takes 5% brainpower to play" and other fun stuff. I told him I had fun playing with them, they wrecked me, and I sincerely wished him a nice night to which he replied "The feeling's not mutual." :( I just don't understand taking a game so seriously that you have to be a raging doucher.
---
Ohhh, okay! I've never actually gone up against him as a survivor, only played him as the killer...
---
Congrats, nice job! :D
---
Not quite tbagging but trapper can spam trap setting on a survivor
---
I mean, put aside the entire diddling children parts (which is honestly something you should never put aside, but just for the sake of argument), the Creeper isn't all that interesting a killer.
---
Honestly endgame is the money maker. 
---
 Bbq or nurses calling to find.
---
REMEMBER me to save time
---
Blood WARDEN to make butt dancers suffer 
---
Then throw some noed on there for extra salt from said butt dancers. 
---
The perfect build combo' d with a nice purple block and kerosene can and beautiful and zesty ebony to top off the dish or maybe just a black box with purple block to get those REMEMBER me stacks in quickly. This dish is sure to have your guests full and extremely unhappy giving you plenty of 4 mans and bloodpoints
---
I have legacy... only got 1 complete set though. Guess.
---
The licensed ones
---
Rage, yea
---
Deerstalker is useless with him.
---
Bad sportsmanship or bad connection. Hard to tell which sometimes.
---
I did the math and wake up with resilience, spine chill, and leader adds up to about a 22% increase.
---
So who's gonna report this?  i gotta go to work
---
In my opinion the best plan would be to get all of the teachable perks that you want first. 
---
After that, choose 1 character (be it either killer or survivor, tho you can take 1 of both if you want) and get all the perks that you like/want on them. 
---
Then play that one/two characters and use them to get points with which you'll prestiege your Pig/Megan.
---
Eh nvm, I just got nurse's from shrine, and I actually DO have whispers. Can barbq be replaced with noed?
---
I knew the DC was coming but it was still delicious. 
---
Also side note, the Wraith getting chased by your other 3 teammates looked hilarious.
---
i am confused by everything in this sentence
---
Season of the Witch was the best ......
---
i got it months ago ;_; congratulate meeee
---
i also got 100% trophies for all dlcs and such
---
peeps gots ta use da bathroom
---
Use jigsaw piece offerings lol
---
My tip is use BBQ and chili. I dont have him myself but I got the killer perk last time it showed up in the shrine so I'm good.
---
Technically enough to be the difference between life and death, adrenaline would probably be good to get to the gate earlier in place of resilience
---
I feel sorry for you then *nods head*💀💜
---
Happy cake day btw
---
RNGesus is moody sometimes :c
---
Anyone else do this on purpose?
---
Why play a game you’re not having fun in?
---
Highly doubtful
---
Why leave and fuck your whole team ?
---
Ok, sounds like I must try this hahaha. I think it will be epicly fun! I just spend a million into him and got more of the standard meta perks, but I’ll def give this a go tho :)
---
If the first box doesn't get my trap off, then I make the hard read and beeline for the box that is the farthest away.  So far that strategy has paid off the past couple of pig games.
