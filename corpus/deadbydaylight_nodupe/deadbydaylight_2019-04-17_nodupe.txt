Exploding a gen will wake up *everyone who is working on that gen*.
---

---
Cutting yourself while healing will wake you up, while cutting someone else will wake them up.
---
Failing a skill check on a hook does nothing but alert Freddy, though. :L

Is It better to continue to invest in the game on PS4 or switch to PC and repurchase what dlcs I want?
---
I play solo, I have made some dlc/cosmetic purchases on PS4. 
---
However, I‚Äôm concerned that the community is larger on PC and as a result will see the most attention from the developer into the future as well as more ppl thus quicker matches 
---
Thoughts?
---
Damn. Into the ground
---
Still doing 180s in the cornfield, we dont have the heart to tell her the match is over.
---
1 gen on thompson house, they gave me a three gen.  
---
Also not playing nurse, or because I played legion doesnt mean MoM isnt broken, and legion changes are gonna be ass i agree with that. Nurse breaks the game, and I dont wanna play a killer that I deem as unfair, theres a reason shes at the top tier for a reason cuz she literally breaks how the game works. Also Nurse is infuriating to play against, I always do fine as legion without camping or tunneling the unhooked, but when a perk takes all my momentum and says "momentum? gone." how is that not infuriating to play against. I like playing a variety of killer but when survivors win bcuz they have a crutch perk, that doesnt feel good..also the reason why I dont use NOED bcuz its just as much of a crutch as MoM is currently. Why do I get punished when I wouldve won without her running that specific perk, but lost bcuz she had one perk that rewards you for getting hit.
---
Uhmm she would have gottem those stitches if he didn't DC
---
Your right with plague if your 4 man swf the no cleansing thing works great but if your with randoms your just making yourself easy to kill.
---
Run play with your food and become a recruit/default killer
---
To be fair, this does seem like a lot of things are changed at once and maybe the changes should be a bit more gradual. I really hated the legions that spammed feral frenzy I always felt like that was an exploit.
---
Following
---
Technically he's going to be equally as good as wraith. He gets 1 free hit and then finishes with an m1 hit as a 115 speed killer
---
If I know I‚Äôm about to struggle, I‚Äôll attempt. Sometimes I get lucky and pull myself off the hook, other times I don‚Äôt.
---
I‚Äôm not sure why everyone thinks it‚Äôs such a powerful perk. It‚Äôs only good once and you have to reveal yourself to the killer when you heal back to full health if not inside terror radius. Wouldn‚Äôt dead hard be better, or?
---
?????? What else was a buff
---
Git Gud and you can be the movie killer :\^)
---
Bless you, my sweet summer child.
---
Then why are you writing paragraphs to random kids on the Reddit?
---
If you actually want a refund because they changed the way a killer works then you're delusional. Legion isn't fucking ruined, you just can't play them like a total shitbag anymore. The people who played legion normally aren't even going to be affected by these changes.
---
FROM THE FORUM
---
&gt;The following changes allow for direct Survivor counter-play, reduce the potential for exploiting certain game mechanics, and bring The Legion‚Äôs default attributes in-line with other Killers, all while retaining the core vision of this Killer. 
---
It's clear you just want an overpowered killer so here are some suggestions (two of which are free): Spirit, Nurse, and Billy in that order.
---
Nurse breaks the game? She ignores pallets and windows much like Legion, except she requires more skill. She can do short noclip, but just using your eyes/ears and doing simple stuff as quickly changing direction can counter Nurse easily. That, plus her movement speed makes her powerful yet not so powerful she breaks the game. I don‚Äôt know where you got that from.
---
So edgy. And you realize your chance of escaping drops with every other person that dies right? Or do you just ignore gens and search for the hatch all game?
---
My issue comes from the fact that I feel as if survivor feedback is going to outweigh killer feedback. Survivors will be happy legion is nerfed most likely, as I've seen a ton of people flapping their tongues saying how it's a godsend that this character is ruined. I'm hoping the feedback reaches them, I'm just not hopeful. I'll save a lot of it for when the final update comes, but right now it doesnt look good at all.
---
Loving how my meme post is getting down voted üòÇ this community is great !
---
If you are in madness a 'hologram' of the doctor will apear looking in your direction, thereby helping the doctor track you down
---
It‚Äôs so nice
---
r/dataisbeautiful
---
It's not even a licensed character you whiny fucking bitch, there are 2 options here either you bought legion before you knew how strong he was, so if he was released post-nerf you would've bought him anyways because you buy shit without researching it 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
or B you bought legion specifically because he was the most braindead piece of garbage killer and you should've known the game wasn't gonna stay very easy, braindead, everyone hates you for playing it-mode forever. You didn't waste your money you bought 4 months of finally being able to beat survivors who would normally be teabagging your ass at the gate and now those 4 months of babysitting are over and go fuck yourself.
---
Yeah I get it's a somewhat small game team but I've seen one man indie devs do waaaaay better. What's going on with Behavior?
---
I was about to get angry but then
---
&gt; Like a quiet crackling sound
---
Almost got bamboozled, pack up the angry comments you guys, it's a joke.
---
‚Äúim gonna laugh my dick off‚Äù 
---
sounds interesting...
---
Letterman Frank is the best.
---
So what if i bought legion because it was on sale 2 weeks ago, decided to level it up and i came across both add ons, had nothing else to use so i equipped the double mend? (I only did the double mend like for two games not knowing about this bug...)
---
Hot take: legion is one of the most fun killers to play as, could care less what the memey groupthink is here.
---
The only reason freddy got nerfed was that he was unfun to play against. Legion is getting nerfed for the same reason.
---
That actually sounds pretty cool.
---
In no way does doctor need changes lmao
---
He literally have no context of what happened, all I see here if a Nea sandbagging a Dwight
---
And when they frenzy another Legion member appears and pushes the wheelchair for them.
---
Things that were wrong:
---
Moonwalking and dropping chase to make the survivor bleed out with no counterplay. This got fixed - Terror radius stops the bleedout. Mending stops the bleedout.
---
Feral frenzy hits are unavoidable, so no matter how well you play you will go down with no counterplay. Frank's mixtape only made it worse. This got fixed - Frenzy hits are still unavoidable, but they can't down you anymore. The survivor now has means of countering them. Legion now has normal movement speed so they have realistic means of downing you normally.
---
The survivor can also try to spin the killer to make them miss and cancel the power. Frank's mixtape is getting reworked. 
---
Sounds like a lot of good changes to me.
---
Awww, someone doesn't have the F pass :(
---
So in Layman's terms, goodbye Legions. 
---
Un-be-fucking-leivable. They actually just made him worthless now. Nothing can ever be in the middle, it's either REALLY good or REALLY bad in this game.
---
I think Legion will take Freddy's place. These changes sound like a complete nerf. Legion wasn't OP, I'd argue he was even weak, it's just that a few of his mechanics got exploited and some of his addons were very strong.
---
The problem was that he was annoying to play against. This change sounds like a direct nerf and I think he will be WAY worse than Freddy.
---
But hey, at least we get rid of the non-counterplay annoying killer legion used to be
---
"it do be like that." - Claudette
---
way to nerf him. If you want to get steam rolled then play legion.
---
This is so sad :( Alexa, can we play Frank's mixtape?
---
Not a lot, increased MS to 115% (more efficient chases), increased TR to 32 m (better tracking) you have to wait for the gauge to fill completely to use it again (so stop spamming), decreased feral frenzy speed (stop tunneling), you cant see the progression of the DW bar (no more moonwalking exploit) increased feral frenzy duration (more efficient chases).
---
Thats basically it. They made him more efficient and less annoying. Basically any non-spamming/tunnelling Legion got a pretty big speed buff. Now, the spamming/tunneling Legions got deleted.
---
Oof
---
It was introduced as a mechanic to balance borrowed time - it made the perk what was said - borrowed time. You had time, sure, but you had escape the killer quickly - If you didn't actively try to escape, you'd die anyways. Thus your time was borrowed.  Now there is no incentive to actually escape the chase - your timer is paused, so it's only actual detriment is spending a brief time healing a wound that doesn't even show on nurse's calling. Barring the exploit, that is nothing.  And now it doesn't even proc inside the terror radius, so you have literally no incentive to try and heal it until you are far enough away from the killer that there is no way at all he can try to punish you for it.
---
Thank you for your kindness. I'm still new to reddit. Haven't really used it until late last year.
---
WOW!!! BBQ AND CHILI!!!! I was just about to think about purchasing leatherface while I‚Äôm on spring break to get it! such a BLESSING!!!
---
Hey at least you got a killer where people will D/C the moment you take them to a hook and call you a camper
---
Oh yeah Jeff, suvivors don't matter because they bring nothing unique to the table.... I thing Jeff is a good reason to keep it.
---
You know that actually might be plausible. I just hope The Legion turns out better after the PTB
---
"WAAAAH mommy they said a bad word!"
---
Sakdada Skadeen get this shit of my screen
---
I‚Äôve been there. But I‚Äôve also had strangers take hits for me and come back after the gates to rescue me. You just never know what kind of teammate you‚Äôll have.
---
I'mma have to see how this plays out but I gotta concur with some other folks if it doesn't make me look like a royal jerk for playing Legion I'll take it. I'm wary but I wanna try it out first.
---
(Wiggles fingers) how do you think this hand got so muddy in the first place? üòú
---
If they don't mend they stay injured, so they are easy to down as you are now a 115% killer. It's like Plague.
---
This should make people happy.
---
Im speechless. We did it bois thanks to everyone who has been sticking around with me on this long journey that has finally come to an end. We are at the end. we won. we got bbq
---
I can't believe this is real, wow.
---
Personally I feel like the Plague is just a better Legion
---
I second this
---
NSFW this
---
That video freakin gets me every time.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say killed. I‚Äôd say massacred. This change just makes him an m1 killer and I hope they don‚Äôt go through with any of the proposed changes. The only things they needed to do was stop legions from moonwalking not stop legions from using their power.
---
Figures, they would put BBQ in there after I painstakingly grinded for it on Bubba, but on the bright-side I don't have to pay nor grind Clown to get Bamboozle.
---
&gt;Nurse, Spirit, and Hag are all top tier and truly viable with 110%. 
---
I'd like to point out that Nurse has a movement speed of 96.25%
---
I tends to be lost on the community
---
Wait resilience doesn't effect vault speed, it still says that it effects vault speed in the description.
---
I guess I'll buy lithe lol
---
Hahahaha. Facts...
---
Why wait till I hook them for a D/C when I can play legion? He seems more efficient with that then Leatherface.
---
I think the legion should be able to use frenzy the same way as before but keep the missing attack cancels frenzy thing. That was a lot of our complaints and the moon walk of course which BHVR previously called a "unique" way to play legion...lmao about as unique as irridescent hatchets. Also the adjusted speed was nice.
---
Since you're obviously a Wizard can you summon M&amp;A in the next Shrine plz.
---
[removed]
---
Can you not buy licensed characters with shards? I just saved up a ton to do just that and now I'm not seeing an option to.
---
While I don't condone DC'ing I completely understand why they would quit.
---
Let‚Äôs be completely honest, in recent memory, have they made any changes from the PTB to Live? Usually they just stick whatever they‚Äôre releasing there 2 days early for the players who‚Äôve been around long enough to use it
---
At least u got Franklin's Demise (not the best of the perks, but surely a pain in the ass)
---
UHHH I DONT KNOW HOW I SHOULD FEEL ABOUT THIS
---
Omg nooo
---
Of course he has an anime profile pic.
---
I just looked at all the killers. The Legion and Freddy will be the only ones who can‚Äôt use their power in some way to down someone while in a chase. Everyone else has an ability that helps to end a chase. 
---
Hag and Trapper can place or fake-place traps for mind games and forcing a player off of a loop.
---
The Pig can use a dash to make a safe loop non-safe or crouch to counter rotate. 
---
Myers can insta-down and gains speed/lunge buffs. 
---
Wraith can hit directly out of a cloak (even though there is a slowdown). 
---
4.6 speed will be nice, but a skilled killer with thousands of hours can get a 4K without using powers due to game and map knowledge alone.  The powers are what makes a killer unique and satisfying to play. Once you hit someone now, the power will be useless. That is what I am not happy about. Legion needed to be changed, but this seems to just makes the killer bland. 
---
Devs, please give Legion (and eventually Freddy) some reason to use the power in a chase.
---
Just make her brown shirts bright pink and yellow. Watch people freak out they can't camp a bush for the match.
---
In general I'd say it's definitely a nerf, but it will significantly buff the way I play legion:
---
Frenzy -&gt; hit survivor -&gt; bodyblock survivor -&gt; stun -&gt; chase out of frenzy -&gt; down
---
Only thing I'm really scared of is how much they reduced his frenzy movement speed
---
Best shrine probably ever lol.
---
I thought they recently added bans to PS4? Or did I just hear wrong
---
Been working on a remake for a year for Freddy
---
I said the same thing brother. Its like people forgot why freddy got nerfed.
---
Am I reading the changes wrong!? It seems like a major nerf so I guess if you hit multiple survivors and then just focus down the last one you hit would be the way to play Legion? I‚Äôm confused I guess to how this rework works.
---
Kinda like how DS showed up right as it was changed?
---
Thanks for letting us know

The first person wasn't talking about having a smaller terror radius but bigger with distressing. That's why I assumed you were giving them ideas on how to make it bigger.
---
My mistake. I am aware of stealth doc! It can be fun sometimes.
---
Well yeah, they obliterated a killer, this is how they compensate for it. Do you honestly think the shrine is random?
---
But the dlc pack is 7$ or 5$ for just Legion?
---
The devs are absolutely inept.
---
**Buffs:**
---
Faster movement
---
Iridescent Button no longer requires a hit
---
Longer Fury
---
**Nerfs:**
---
Requires power to be full
---
Bigger terror radius
---
Slower movement speed in Fury
---
Can't see blood pools
---
Can't see Deep wound progress
---
Deep wound is paused while in the terror radius
---
Deep wound is paused while mending
---
Frenzy is cancelled when an attack is missed
---
Deep wound isn't reduced by further attacks
---
&gt; remove some of the ongoing frustrations when playing as The Legion as well as against The Legion
---
Which we done by making no one play the Legion.
---
Any dev worth their salt knows not to do so many changes all at once. A few changes could be enough, then the rest are just over nerfs. Best of all, it's going to take two years to make him decent again.
---
At this rate Freddy is going to be S tier after their changes.
---
She's really not that good. I haven't played her AS killer but as survivor going against her she seems fairly OK (decent in the right hands and really shit in the hands of a lot of players). The main counter to plague is just never cleansing. Doesn't matter if you infect people if you're all infected. I literally never cleanse against her to give her more power and it works out aright.
---
No please dear god don‚Äôt. Every single perk we get gets fucking nerfed. We already have a shitty perk selection
---
You feel you are going to have a bad time
---
While I hate to see another killer get freddy'd, this one really needed a nerf.  Just played a legion the other day that used the add-ons where each hit made the deep wound timer longer and he would never finish a kill.  By the time we got the exit gates going my mend wouldn't move at all.  I had to go down and let a teammate heal me to even do anything.  At least we see a nice buff to borrowed time.  I know some killers will hate it but I feel it only affects camping and tunneling killers.
---
#[**OOF**](/intensifies)
---
Why not just save them tho?
---
So where‚Äôs the Rant
---
Lol, oh sorry... that‚Äôs SO much better 
---
They also nerfed the speed while in ff, so that kind of negates that ‚Äúbuff‚Äù
---
Really? I guess ill go get the 250k blood points.
---
You don‚Äôt control hidden score.
---
As someone who mains survivor more Spirit is definitely one of my favourite killers to go against (and the one I play most). I think a lot of people need to play her to find it easier to go against her.
---
Credit to u/ZombieHuggerr for the template.
---
Just Ochidi
---
well, truly BBQ and chili is an amazing perk because now i can not only get bloodpoints quickly with it but i can also get 150k bloodpoints right now with it!
---
Is this really a survivor/ killer main thing? Because literally on this very sub right before this rework was released there were "killer mains" openly talking about how Legion needed a rework. Nobody SPECIFICALLY asked for this exact rework, survivors or killers. It's disappointing to me as a "survivor main" (I do play killer as well) that his rework is like this, but he was absolutely broken as fuck before. I'm not sure why people are suddenly in denial of that.   
---
More importantly, I don't think he was fun to play as before. I tried playing Legion a few times and in the games where it wasn't a DC simulator it never felt rewarding doing well. It felt cheap. I wish they'd totally have reworked him rather than nerfing his power into something like this but nobody has played him yet, and we don't know the changes to his addons so I think it's too early to tell how shit he's going to be.
---
Cool, less than a week after I buy the Leatherface DLC, which BTW they [raised the base price](https://steamdb.info/app/700280/) of it a couple months ago so the new sale price is almost the same as the base price used to be Lmao
---
Neat, thank you
---
I see, thank you
---
no worries! üíú
---
Oh my fucking god you are a blessing. It is in the shrine
---
I agree. I was so scared and confused the first time I played I followed a Jake around the whole map.
---
totally destroyed.  the community wanted a rework not nerfs that actually make it below Freddy itself.  Well, I won't have to worry about legion anymore I guess. F for legion mains
---
Fuck you Dave. It snowed here.
---
It‚Äôs 2700 shards the first time it appears in the shrine, 2000 every time after. Doesn‚Äôt depend on amount of time the perk has been out.
---
True that. Lucky me I play console so I have D/Cs, more noobs, garbage sensitivity and no ptb so legion is still a great D/C farmer lol.
---
It'd be like instasaw built into your kit for pallets, just use Brutal strength if you are into that.
---
That effect is powerful enough to warrant an add on. I don't think it needs changes.
---
Any idea why?
---
CJ would be a great survivor
---
Patch 2.5.0 (January 22nd) changed window vaults.
---
&gt;Adjusted the Vault mechanic so that survivors come out of the vault with momentum, instead of being set to 0 movement speed after a vault.
---
&gt;Changed the Medium Vault speed to last 0.9 seconds down from 1 second.
---
&gt;Created a new Medium Vault animation to distinguish the medium from the slow and fast vaults.
---
This was supposed to alleviate occurrences of being hit well after vaulting a window, but it has if anything only made them worse. What this change did do is make Action Speed no longer affect window vault speed. The developers did address this on the official stream, saying they would consider giving at least Resilience and Spine Chill the ability to speed up window vaults back again, but it will soon have been three months since, without as much as a single word on this. And yes, Resilience still lists "vaulting". Who knows, one of these patches, it might just silently disappear from the perk description.
---
Not even focusing on BBQ, this is a great all-around shrine.
---
Did you just assume they have a gender?
---
The problem with No Mither is that there really isn't any benefits to run it, sure it silences your grunts by 50% but you could just run Iron Will. The ability to fully recover is great but most Killers won't slug in general if there's no real reason to especially if you're Running No Mither. The only real benefit I can see is that you don't leave blood trails and won't have to worry about healing so it counters Bloodhound and Sloppy butcher. But having yourself super vulnerable with practically no benefits isn't worth taking up a perk slot. I've heard suggestions stating that it should grant bonus bloodpoints in all categories for its high risk high reward and I wouldn't mind having that added.
---
Only when you.
---
Good.
---
Dead meme
---
Two of the blade addons that add mending time. You need to have both of them equipped for it to be broken.
---
You had no counterplay to Legion's ability downing you, or to moonwalking.
---
Now there is counterplay.
---
Not sure, he hasn‚Äôt uploaded in 2 months but my guess is that he got tired from making YouTube content.
---
Nope. An easy way to tell is to use a brown toolbox. With 80 charges, it'll be consumed if you fully repair a gen with it. However, if you hit even one great skill check, you'll keep it. Same goes for medkits.
---
Yes... but too much... wasn‚Äôt necessary
---
Please, spare me. Other than not being able to see blood, which is a quetionable change, this will literally make them better yet less cancer to play against. They will actually be able to waste time making you mend. You really cant tell me this is worse than they currently are. Most of the changes make sense. Also, its ptb, which is subject to change.
---
Holy shit can we take a second to show you how wrong almost every statement you made here was?  
---
"Legion can't down people in frenzy anymore"   
---
Do you know what that statement actually means? It means he's trapper or wraith with no killer ability. And before you say it, "He has a power tho" lets go over why his power is literally useless now.  
---
"He's a 115% killer now with a useful power."  
---
So you can hit people through pallets now, that's great! Too bad you can't down them, literally ever until they run out of pallets. You know how everyone LOVES freddy because of his complete inability to do a single god damn thing about pallet looping? Congrats, that's legion now too. Sure, they can hit you over a pallet, and then face a 3 second stun and now the survivor is at another pallet. You can either continue to chase them, and still not be able to hit them, or you can go back and break the pallet, and lose the chase. "Useful" power.  
---
"No counterplay as you ignored pallets and windows"  
---
You know who that sounds an awful lot alike? Nurse, Huntress, and Hag. But because of the extreme levels of survivor salt towards playing against legion(which was completely unwarranted btw), They just basically removed them from the game. Why don't we remove nurse, huntress, and hag too? They all do the same thing. Except they do it better. Nurse is just legion if legion didn't have to hit you 4 times, Huntress is the same thing.   
---
All these changes are, are extreme nerfs outright removing a character honestly, and is one of the most extreme cases of Survivor Bias I've seen in the 4 years of this game.
---
I just grinded for it two weeks ago. 
---
#SHIT
---
Kinda sad that the changes turned them into a m1 killer, but they were flawed from a design perspective. lets see how they fare on the PTB
---
I really hope they can turn things around during the PTB next week otherwise I've really lost faith in BHVR when it comes to reworks.
---
did they check the corners yet?
---
No it‚Äôs 2000 shards for 150k
---
thats literally the point of this post
---
What?
---
Sadly I'll be busy playing MK11 to care
---
Someone's IRL killer main is showing. I'll be forwarding your concerns to the FBI.
---
I just got it two weeks ago...
---
Okay. Thanks for the info. (:
---
Ok thank you
---
Let's see. He can't protect hooks, gens/doors/totems/heals (you can even just run up to a just downed survivor and start healing them and Freddy literally can't stop you until 7 seconds later...) pop in his face during the dream transition, he has no hatch game unless the last survivor is asleep, can't defend totems either, several meta perks kick his ass... on and on and on.
---
I thought you were just being a dick but then I read this, gj you did the right thing OP
---
#GREAT! JUST GOT IT TWO WEEKS AGO!
---
Wait really? I always knew that new perks cost more until the next chapter.
---
Because the slow killers have a power that makes them impossible to be looped. Hag cant get looped, spirit cant get looped and huntress cant either.
---
choose one , the pizza or your soul \`
---

---
I‚Äôd say survivors are just as likely to DC against Doc. He seems to really be hated for some reason.

Duration got increased, I'm hoping the changes to the speed while in frenzy could be reverted after we test how good/bad it ends up being in the ptb.
---
Amen, it seems like it felt too one sided and everyone deserves to have their fun. They seem to be keeping up with people more, I just really hope it continues like you say.
---
Same, during the Steam Sale. I just prepared myself for it to come in the Shrine soon because I know I have that type of luck.
---
[I got another link for that scenario](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9RAZxNdCk8)
---
here ya go :)
---
Because hitting someone with your normal attack might take another minute or two.
---
Have fun with that captain autismo.
---
I used double blades once a while back because I didn‚Äôt have any better add ons to use. I don‚Äôt recall it taking that long for people to mend though.
---
Had no idea there was any issues as the only place I get my DBD info is here, and I don‚Äôt visit here daily.
---
It‚Äôs obvious timing they wanted there to be less drama after they announced legions death certificate.
---
I agree. I don't use exploits nor moonwalk when I play Legion but if their power will no longer help in chases I might as well play Trapper with no Traps.
---
Legit I saw a better rework idea a few weeks back 
---
[This is what the Legion should've been.]
---
Sorry, was just excited to share the news. It's only been 30 minutes, people have been waiting for this for a while apparently -\_-
---
The funny thing is the vast majority of killer mains have Leatherface.
---
But there is no stun if you hit them? If you hit them once then you apply the deep wound and your power is refreshed. You can either cancel the power to try to down the survivor, try to go for someone else or for some reason hit the survivor again. That will not progress the bleedout timer as that got changed, and you will get stunned.
---
If you didn't get stunned after hitting them with a power again, that'd be too strong. You'd hit them to injure them, hit them again and cancel the power while right at their back (with 115% movement speed), and down them. No counterplay. The stun is needed.
---
It is the PSN Messaging app with the edit function of iPhone 8.
---
Useless, no, but unsatisfying. The powers make killers unique by changing the play styles. This makes Legion bland  
---
The power is not even satisfying. It will still be brainless to get the first hits with Frenzy. After the first hit, you play it like an M1 killer and there is nothing special or fun. 
---
I understand the frustration with the old version, but don‚Äôt you want killers that play differently and require different strategies so it isn‚Äôt boring as survivor? With these changes, after the first hit, playing again Legion is like playing against any other killer. Boring.
---
BBQ and Bamboozle are amazing on almost every killer.
---
I'm clutching my buttcheeks in rabid anticipation of the Freddy rework. I want to see how bad he can be.
---
Legion isn't just gone he got thanos snapped
---
The true endgame
---
it's been teased by behavior and the people w the right to him, but no official confirmation. hopefully we get a new killer teaser/announcement when the patch drops!
---
Is it just me or every Claudette has like 10 of these. I have 3 on claudette wtf i dont even use her
---
i just bought leatherface last night ffs
---
This just gives me a terrible feeling that we're gonna see some form of nerf to it sometime soon
---
Pig. but I'm biased, so ask the next biased person.
---
Its personal preference ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Im anticipating the freddy rework to be absolutely awful.
---
Hahaha I bought it a week ago as well! Damn
---
Its a shame really...
---
Cool! The figures are a bit small though. The Clown won't like that lol !
---
"In public matches, as the Legion, down 25 different Survivors that have Deep Wound applied.
---
This used to be implemented as requiring you to down Survivors with Deep Wound while in Feral Frenzy. This requirement has been removed in line with the text, so now it's just a matter of hitting Survivors with a normal attack while not in FF."
---
In this same thread
---
The man has mental illness, mutilating your own body and acting like someone else for attention should not be encouraged nor accepted, but yea the vid is kinda funny if you *just* look at the dbd related content, but all in all the video is still increadibly sad to watch when it comes to irl, the fact that this man is on a TV show and many children may watch and not in an asylum is just....
---
Yeah just like Legion is not unfun/annoying to go against and yet it doesnt matter especially if the masses decide to make a tantrum about it
---
ITS FINALLY HERE
---
can't say how bad this is until I do try it, 115 movement speed is great though
---
thank you for your sacrifice
---
burlap head woman good
---
Good idea while we're at it we should put light houses and arrows by the totem aswell
---
Myers is the best. But im a freddy main..
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm very happy with this one. Especially after last week‚Äôs.
---
I mean Legion was flawed from a design perspective, ignoring all the survivors defence mechanics isnt healthy.  Turning them into a M1 killer is really all they could do while keeping the core aspects of their kit alive (the mending on everyone)
---
Woke up in the morning I got Legion on my mind.
---
Saw a better rework than this by u/Brilliant_Vegatable
---
It's insane that missing a hit ends power.  Literally useless lol
---
/cries
---
Just for curiosity's sake, I played legion without using his power today. Even now, is power is only moderately useful in some circumstances. I usually play spirit, and I love her mind games. But I thought it was hilarious that, even though I never once activated my power, I had 1 person immediately DC and another DC after getting downed. 
---
Next match, I use his power. I lost hard and got to watch the group tbag on their way out. Legion was never powerful, but at least he used to be somewhat fun, if for no other reason than to shut down pallet Loopers.
---
We don't know what the add ons are going to do, so we need to wait.
---
&gt;My guess is add-ons (Frank's) will still let you Frenzy them down.
---
Why would they introduce back the balance problem that they made a point to remove in this patch inside of an add on? One of the major problems with Legion is that he can down you with Frenzy with 0 counterplay. Why would they introduce it again if they are removing it with this change?
---
Very well said.
---
That sucks
---
Damn! I don‚Äôt know what I should get: B&amp;C or the Kate Beanie?
---
The only thing warranted here is making feral frenzy deplete on missed attacks and take more charge to use.  Everything else was just buying into the hate meme.
---
Yeah...I bet it's tolerable...Considering you can't get a single kill with it. I bet the survivors will "tolerate" all their free escapes just fine...  
---
Btw, to be on average with other "time waster" killers, mending would have to take easily 25 seconds. Which all the survivors would bitch about. So you know, that'll get nerfed real fast.   
---
Don't worry though, the killers have only been bitching about the hatch mechanic for 4 years. Maybe it'll get changed one day. But hoo boy if there's anything even slightly wrong for the survivors, better get on that real fast.
---
I've had Leatherface since his release but I've always wanted to see BBQ in the shrine again
---
I don't like playing against Myers because of how fucking fast he is lol. Hiding from him is fun but you get in a chase with anything above T1 Myers and you're fucked.
---
hahahaha
---
licensed killers and survivors are only obtainable through money
---
You sonovabitch!
---
ffs, wanted it as killer but not as survivor
---
Let's a put a cooldown on Billy's chainsaw sprint to lol lets really make killers useless!
---
I never said that they need to have add ons to be viable, I jus said that the add ons will have a massive influence on how strong they are in game.
---
Even ignoring that, we still can't make blind claims without playing them out on the PTB, so we still need to wait before we make any judgements.
---
‚ÄúWelcome to my world, bitch.‚Äù
---
But how does this change a killer or survivors play style or strategies? Think about how differently you play against Hag vs Myers vs Huntress vs Spirit. They require survivors and killers to change how they play. That is what changes up the game and makes it fun. This makes Legion only an M1 killer. Both survivors and killers lose in this.
---
The ‚ÄúMissing ends the Frenzy‚Äù thing raises the skill cap on the character significantly. I know that I am a poor shot and tend to swing wildly, so this makes them Unplayable to me, personally.
---
That doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs bad for players OVERALL, but for me, personally, this is a dealbreaker.
---
I was literally just about to buy leatherface for bbq. Best day of my life
---
"Legion rework is cocontroversial, we need a distraction"
---
"BBQ on the shrine"
---
Genius!"
---
I know it's random but I find it funny
---
Nice trolling
---
Jesus whats the point of even applying wounds if they have to be across the map for them to bleed. You‚Äôre right it really does feel like they just needed 4.6m/s and gor the ability to wear off if they miss an attack but instead the devs couldn‚Äôt decide what change to apply and just did they all lmao
---
In other news, the 'female killers with 115% speed' club is gaining two new members.
---
I'd just rather not be noisy and one shot the whole game. Corrupt Purge is honestly not that hard to dodge and you can always try hiding. Looping pretty much stops her from ever hitting you with Corrupt Purge. Or you can just have her track where you are and let her get an easy down.
---
"Plague is unfun because she just vomits on you and instadowns you! Please nerf her!"  
---
  
---
...Come back at me when they remove your killer.
---
Huntress with her insta down hatchets but freddy is the most fun to play although legion is fun if you want disconnecting player points
---
If you play him good he's fine. Literally all killers have the same issues from what I've seen playing. Freddy has attributes that make up for it. Like never escaping a chase cause even if you do wake yourself up he still gets a notification. Most survivors won't be able to hide well either because they will think they are hidden until they start falling asleep. I'm pretty good with freddy. I'm even better on other killers. If you let the game get to where a exit gate is opening then you have blood warden for a reason. I know a perk shouldn't balance the killer but it is his perk. Also if you have to do a hatch stand off you already have a 3k so it doesn't suck to lose one person. I just think people are a little harder on him than they should be. The main thing that could help fix any issue would be to remove the dream transition but he will lose tracking so you would give up a bad thing and a good thing.
---
Just like the bloodweb glitch. They say they cant ban console players for lag switching because microsoft/sony wont let them. But console japanese players find out how to cheat the bloodweb? Oh now they can ban them. This company is like actually really scummy and its hilarious how people just eat it up. Its like a pathetic Indie game dev version of stockholm syndrome.
---
Honestly, it's not like they don't KNOW about it.
---
Totem counter, and simple pings should be easy. I mean, they already have the map ping, for goodness sakes.
---
Why....do...so...many...people...keep....saying...mending...is...a....time...waster...  
---
IT...TAKES...5...SECONDS..
---
Finally! Some good fucking food!
---
She's my secondary
---
Same
---
Holy
---
For all we know, Mr. Pizza Man has the highest score even despite the death and Nea getting the hatch.
---
BECAUSE WE DON‚ÄôT KNOW.
---
All we have is a clip from Nea‚Äôs point of view, from Nea‚Äôs account, put forward specifically for Nea‚Äôs bias.
---
*insta farming*
---
Not including the free ones (huntress and nurse) 
---
Myres 
---
Spirit 
---
Plague 
---
Hag
---
Pig
---
Clown 
---
Doctor
---
Leather face 
---
Freddy (he‚Äôs getting reworked and it‚Äôs very likely he‚Äôll be higher but we don‚Äôt know anything about the rework so I‚Äôll just leave him here) 
---
Legion (legion is getting heavily nerfed and I‚Äôm certain most of the changes will go through but if he wasn‚Äôt he‚Äôd be above doctor)
---
Right, so just loop them until the game is over! The standard M1 killer classic! Such fun!
---
Lots of shadows and weeds and high grass. Blends in great. Just slice and dice when around those areas if you up against all Clauds.
---
They've said they'll reveal details next month.
---
If only the community would be this vocal about Nurse or Billy. But no, we gotta pick on poor ol' Legion. If they would have just changed the moonwalk, then I think that would have been an acceptable nerf. If they would have made it to where he actually goes around and hitting everyone instead of now where he's just way more effective at tunneling the shit out of one person, then that would have been fine too.
---
Ah well  I don't know if you're a troll or just a total dumnass, just leave dude.
---
Show the video where she hit him though...
---
BBQ is in the Shrine this is not a drill.
---
Its even more boring design than the Legion we have now. You are simply an M1 killer where your power makes getting the first hit a bit easier, and then you normally chase someone as an 115% M1 killer. Literally how is that fun in anyway to play?
---
At least after freddy waits 7 seconds, and he hits you, it actually matters at all.
---
Especially on nurse
---
Anyone can get a 4k as any killer if they know how to play. Chill, it's not like they fucking deleted him lol. 
---
You've got essentially a guaranteed first hit and then it's just a chase, which buffed movement speed will help you succeed with. Sure, his power is far more boring and Legion is practically just and M1 killer, but he's not completely useless.
---
I doubt it as they didn‚Äôt do it with Freddy but it is plausible
---
Shutup pizza boy, go make my large supreme or imma complain to corporate.
---
Yea that happened to me too, infinite loading screen and then I have to restart my steam to get dbd working again.
---
Currently Legion isn't okay but ***this...*** This is inhumane.
---
Really have to see the numbers and adjusted add-ons to make any definite conclusions, but it does look like that Legion might become the weakest Killer without add-ons.
---
Honestly I don't see this change doing much for a tunneling Legion, not seeing survivors anymore kinda defeats the purpose of switching targets. He's more tolerable now, but still should be annoying to deal with for the first found survivor.
---
PTB is an acronym for Free Advertising Build. Its just a misspelling on the acronym.
---
Did you miss the sarcasm marker, Legion is fucking garbage to go against no matter how they play.
---
It might have been a year and a half but I saved $5 so I'll call that a win
---
You can loop around that bottom window for a ridiculous amount of time. Use pallets to keep that window loop going
---
if you read at what I said in context, the point I was making to who I responded to is that there's no reason to get hit by feral frenzy if you can avoid it so you don't need to ~~waste~~ spend time mending and healing later.
---
I hate both survivors here. If you're temporarily in a locker that's one thing but don't bounce around in them the whole time. And if I play as killer and someone points at a locker I make sure to kill the person that pointed because they're a piece of shit. So yeah, you should really stop doing that.
---
Imagine paying for a game just so you could not play it
---
No... we dont...
---
This had better not be a fucking joke
---
Michael Myer's
---
Imagine thinking you have any right to criticize how someone plays a game they paid for.
---
Glory and wonder, Friend. It ain‚Äôt.
---
&gt;If you play him good he's fine
---
That... literally has nothing to do with the plethora of issues Freddy has, but ok. I, however, am not going to spit out something like that and call it a day. 
---
People will 99% gates for a reason, especially against a Freddy, just because it's his perk. Also, you're basically admitting that Freddy has an issue with stuff popping in his face by saying that. Any other killer would be able to stop shit like that. Freddy literally can't. 
---
Also also, removing the dream transition wouldn't remove his tracking. There does need to be absolutely 0 progression on any progress bar during the dream transition and failed skillchecks do not wake you up during the transition, however.
---
thanks for making me laugh
---
Even without exploits, he had fundamental problems.  The fact that mending works as it does now, so once someone starts, if a Legion happens upon them, they have a free down, which is one of the things they've done right in correcting, and making his ability at least *seem* more counter-able (as it is now, frenzy has no counter) by slowing down his frenzy somewhat but extending its length.  Some of the other changes, like losing frenzy if they miss a hit, etc., are questionable, though, for sure.
---
There might be other tweaks down the road that might be buffs, I honestly just hope they completely overhaul and redo his ability, since it's just really poorly conceived of to begin with.
---
Question is can you convince PlayStation to change it? They rarely do change trophies except for instances with Overwatch, haven't heard them change other trophies before.
---
Even then they only changed those because they would have been impossible to get as they changed the character abilities for Hanzo and Mercy, so the trophies were voided.
---
Looks like it's time to start using my 100 ebony and ~franks and deep wound studies on my legion. I'm gonna enjoy this slaughter
---
I wont mind facing myers if he wasnt using the same set every time, i swear i only faced one tombstone myers and one scratched mirrior myers and it was fun and refreshing, but every myers i face stalk until EW3 and start attacking and no its not even infinite EW3.
---
Believe it or not I find BBQ good on doctor. Maybe I'm a bit shitty at finding survivors but I find the auras reveal extra confirmation where I need to go next considering as doc you're often running around like crazy trying to get madness up + doc earns bloodpoints like crazy. 
---
Also with a railgun doc (Interview tape + high stim electrode) you can usually zap people's auras from across the map. Might not be that useful but it probably scares the pants off survivors to be struck by a "bolt from the blue" especially without distressing and using monitor and abuse.
---
nah don't think I will, thanks for the advice though!
---
This year everyone is deleting their channels... This is not good
---
Yeah. They could get reported if they were working with you for a significant portion of the game.
---
He was one of the few creators that put a lot of work into his videos. I hope this makes people realise how much work some people put into their videos and that they should maybe turn Adblock off or share those videos.
---
Holy fuck this is such a shit nerf! I'd rather keep the current Legion than this shit. He's fucking useless now.
---
[Insert joke about legion/Freddy]
---
I mean he is funny to play
---
redneck man good
---
How many more of these posts are we going to seeeeeeee?
---
How can they ban people who have had 2 killers? I've run into that as survivor and killer and it was definitely not something we did intentionally. The fuck? BHVR trying to blame us for their glitch?
---
Twitter is always another whole new level, even for this Subreddit.
---
Nice.

I think you missed the party where Frenzy speed is significantly slower. So what if you can see them at 32m and the Frenzy is slightly longer. Your speed is reduced and they can most likely run away in time. The person mending will be completed by the time you get to the next survivor.
---
If you draw a line between BT and deep wound - which I personally don‚Äôt but I see why you would - fair enough.  Also, totally agree on Moonwalking.  Moonwalking is a shitty exploit.
---
Inb4 people who miss it this week bitch for another year.
---
Hey Dwights, I found the stinky Ace main :(
---
Really? You want a killer that requires no new strategies or play style? 
---
Killers are unique and the best killers require changing how you play and play against them. You don‚Äôt want some variety?

150k BP for me then considering I have all of these. Unless BBQ is 2700.
---
nice.
---
According to McLean, he is faster than bloodlust 1 but slower than bloodlust 3 and the duration of frenzy is "significant". Who knows, I might be too optimistic, this is all speculation
---
Especially the way I play him! 
---
Also I find that daily hilarious. Compared to something like "get reverse bear trap kills with the pig" "Zap survivors as doc" is fucking easy. 4 zaps? They could make it 30 zaps and I'd probably get it done within one match.
---
Does this meme come with a magnifying glass?
---
I have a huge love for Freddy. I just don't like how the others control, but that's just me.
---
As I said not including the free ones. Nurse and huntress are both free.
---
And here comes another shitstorm. I'm disappointed with new legion changes, as he was my second favourite killer in the game after hag. Too bad i would have to spend all my ebony mories and purple addons within a week or two before they finish him off. 
---
Survivor mains deserve serious punishment for killing another killer.
---
Ever since borrowed time got change, I've never had it help. The killer was either camping and proceeded to moon walk me, or was just close enough for it to trigger that it ran out before they even got to me. Before it at least bought time, but after the change I've never seen it do even that.
---
I was there when it happened
---
I hated Legion but even I didn't want this to happen. This nerf is dog shit!
---
Freddy is my child. I made him good
---
A lot more
---
Lol
---
But *why*
---
Huntress is considered a DLC because in a kill your friends match if you disable DLCs Huntress is locked, Nurse is not
---
It is the most sought after perk in the entire game
---
I remember at one point I think the hatch used to spawn at matchstart. If you had a key you could escape immediately. I think it was changed to how it is now very early on.
---
This seems like nothing but FUD. There's nothing that makes it apply to this situation in particular. Even if a game *doesn't* collect data related to your gameplay, you have to trust they're not slurping up unrelated data.

Makes total sense. And honestly, we need more of this in the game. The rail gun doc is totally weird and you almost never see them. Play those FUN builds. Don‚Äôt always need the best perks! Blood Warden is always more fun than NOED.
---
 That is irrelevant; aren‚Äôt people seeing the 40 others before them stating the same? And continue to?

I like to run thrill of the hunt and devour hope with that build

...I mean I'm okay with it
---
Youre dumb
---
I am just trying to figure out a reason to use the power after the first hit.
---
Plus, it is no different than Billy or Leather-face. 
---
Frenzy is non-lethal, though, unlike those two.
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôll break your nico nico kneecaps‚Äù
---
Legion is based on two different ideas:
---
 
---
1. A killer that passes for a survivor (Darkness among us)
---
2. A killer that is infact a group of characters
---
Currently, Legion barely qualifies as either of those. They can vault like survivors, cool, but they're still obviously killers, and the fact that they are a group is reflected only in their cosmetics. Let's be honest, Legion will never play to their full potential until they represent these ideas in their gameplay.
---
Look at Micheal for example. Micheal is an ominous stalker who takes his time before going for the kill, then does so with ruthless drive. His gameplay perfectly emulates that idea.
---
What are the saw movies about? Yes there's traps, yes there's bizarre morals, but most of all, it's about tough choices, and almost all of them are choices about sacrifice. Do I finish the gen, or do I wait for my friend to take off their trap? Do I work on my trap, or save the guy on hook?
---
Legion is a killer that vaults pallets and windows quickly, that's what they're about. They're not a gang that you play as or face, they're not a darkness that hides among us, they vault fast and everything else is just trying to balance that.
---
Although true, they did revert the changes multiple times and kept saying they were tinkering with it.
---
Who cares about chances? I'm an edgy teen that wants others to fail.
---
they're banning people abusing the exploit. Not just banning everyone that even unintentionally got into a broken 2+ killer match, no need to worry
---
How are we suppose to get that achievement when you literally nerfed him so hard, mending will never go past halfway in the bar? Like healing and terror radius pause it, that means it's physically impossible to down someone in the mend state.
---
Myers or spirit
---
I did not but why are you so bothered by this? This should be celebrated. We have been waiting for this for the past 84 years
---
Considering the ones complaining are the same degenerate fucktards who played legion everyday even though everybody told them that it was boring braindead and unfun, I could really give any fucks of what these people think, they're human trash, mentally unable pieces of shit who only care about themselves.
---
If they wanna completely rework legion into something that does have counterplay than fine, untill then he should be deleted/nerfed so bad not even this fucking crybaby legionmain who commented before me will play him.
---
Same man I bought him like a week ago
---
You will have to wait until dedicated servers but in the meanwhile feel free to use the in-game report and send us a support ticket.

Iron Maiden- When you enter a locker, you lose all negative status effects. Exiting a locker \*\*Exposes\*\* you for 45/40/35 seconds and your aura is shown to the killer for 6 seconds  
---
"Sometimes, you just gotta bite the bullet"  
---
Discordance- When you are within 8/10/12 meters of another survivor, you cannot be detected by the killer  
---
"Let's give this fucker a hard time"  
---
Mad Grit- When saving a survivor from the killer's grasp, the killer is stunned for 1/1.5/2 more seconds than normal  
---
"You're not gonna get any of us. We're too good at it"
---
**OwO**
---
Anyone not saying the Spirit respectfully doesn't know the killer tier list. Played at max potential, Spirit is unrivalled for DLC killers and only beaten by Nurse and maybe Hillbilly.
---
Now one might not know how to play her very well, so she might not be the "best killer" for them, but she truly is #2/3.
---
&gt;You: I doubt it or you wouldn't be moping like a baby.  
---
Me: Forces you to try to compensate for how ridiculously weak he is, all the time, more like it.
---
Uh, wut, lol. 
---
Take your salt elsewhere if you're going to devolve your half of the argument to name-calling. I don't have time for petty shit like that. 
---
Just because I 4k just fine doesn't mean that Freddy doesn't have glaring issues that need to be fixed.
---
So... there is an add on that I will get banned for using... and I don't even know what that add on is. WTF IS WRONG WITH YOU DEVS! I am pretty sure I have used every legion add on at this point. Guess I am banned now. 
---
If you are not going to ban me I would like my auric cells back for legion if you go though with this update. Making his killer power useless is not an acceptable solution.
---
I think it's 24 hours. After that no chance
---
Legion started in a fundamentally broken state and needed change, regardless of whether or not you abused exploits doesn't make the exploits not exist. This makes perfect sense for BHVR anyways: nerf Legion into the ground, then adjust accordingly to bring them up to a reasonable, balanced state. BHVR never said they wouldn't continue to change Legion until they think they're balanced.
---
Finally some good fucking food
---
You are using it for mobility by gaining a ton of movement speed, not by constantly using it several times.
---
It's equal to nurse lunging after each blink for distance, or billy constantly cancelling his chainsaw charge, or spirit cancelling her power constantly to lunge with bonus ms.
---
In all of those situations they get punished with a fatigue/slow, why shouldn't legion?
---
Clown counters looping too
---
Bamboozle nurse is obviously straight up OP
---
Or black out in some random place by yourself.
---
It may not be a nerf in full, but it makes the killer boring. 
---
The first hits with Frenzy are basically the same free hits. That will still be frustrating for survivors. The downing hits have to be without powers and will be no different than playing against any other M1 killer: no special strategies, no different play style. 
---
Unless the add-ons significantly change the play style, Legion will be a very boring killer to play against with little variety.
---
NANI?
---
You realize that the reason they gave him such a big Nerf is cuz his winrate (from on bhvrs recorded stats that we can't see ) was way above 50%
---
Spirit.
---
Just because it takes a lot of time doesn't make it a good mechanic or balanced.
---
Imagine if a gen completed itself every two minutes that one hadn't been completed by the survivors themselves. Same concept.
---
TBH I'd like to see killers have faster base movespeeds and BL itself removed. It'd be a nice change that rewards good players instead of bad ones.
---
I'm on at random times. Very random. Based on Central states. If I'm on at night it's usually after midnight as I get off work at 1145pm. PSN ID is the same as my sn
---
There are more efficient ways than staying around hook and tunneling, you get more map pressure that way.
---
You don't need to tunnel at all to win games as killer.
---
Almost like Legion actually took a pretty good amount of skill to 4k with, unlike all the braindead Omega Blink Nurses and Carburetor Billy players that infest rank 1.
---
I play with no addons btw so don't even say mixtape.
---
Left behind would like a word
---
Did some googling after posting this cuz mad.
---
"Valve will, upon request via help.steampowered.com, issue a refund for any title that is requested within 14 days of purchase and has been played for less than 2 hours. Even if you fall outside of the refund rules we've described, you can submit a request and we'll take a look at it."
---
I don't know how that works with DLC. Wish me luck!
---
I don't think bt should have the deep wound mechanic. I think it was fine the way it used to be, yeah.
---
Better gone than how he was.  Good riddance.
---
Except you can't down people with it.
---
Thats the dumbest reason. Imagine ruining other peoples games because you want some meaningless achievement
---
is probably why they buffed legion‚Äôs movespeed.
---
Just don't buy the next killer that comes out, that should even it out.
---
Spirit is far ahead Myers, though I guess that‚Äôs debatable because if the bug. But once that gets fixed, it is no doubt spirt. Myers has no way to deal with pallets and windows like spirit can with her mind games.
---
However they weren't the only changes,
---
Larger terror radius, mending pauses bleed out, bleed out doesn't happen within terror radius, frenzy no longer shortens bleed out, frenzy is canceled if you miss, frenzy needs to be fully charged to use, killer can see bleed out timer,can no longer see blood in frenzy.
---
These changes were just over kill
---
EVERYONE STAY CALM
---
The only person you'll be pressuring by using feral frenzy to wound multiple people is yourself.
---
With lower movespeed during frenzy, you'll wound one survivor, and by the time you chase the second one down the first guy will have finished mending.
---
The only way to play Legion now will use -stun time addons, and bodyblock people as you end your stun to m1 them. At which point, you may as well play another killer.
---
Using all free time to practice üòù
---
You can get a hit on them much faster, then stop the power and chase normally. 
---
Legion also doesn't need to wait 7 seconds again if the survivor has a medkit/selfcare/gets lucky with a gen mid chase. They also don't have a built-in borrowed time.
---
_dafuq you just say about the best gurl susie u little shit_
---
I like your opinion. 
---
I actually like someone else's opinion
---
Its historic!
---
This has never happened before!!!!
---
*Screams in Freddy main*
---
That didnt answer the question. What ways are more efficient? You didn't really elaborate. How is me "tunneling" survivors any different than survivors "tunneling" gens? 
---
And? It's a situational tactic. If survivors wanna be dumb and unhook in my face then of course I'm gonna go after the hurt one.
---
Now that it‚Äôs only in terror radius that‚Äôs just replacing moonwalking with insidious and I hate that perk as it is
---
What? Jason was considered extremely underpowered about a week after release and it never got fixed
---
Hey hey hey there buddy ,  easy killer.
---
Can I has cheeseburger?
---
&gt; The Deep Wound timer progress is no longer reduced by regular Feral Frenzy attacks. 
---
Jeezo. One step forward, two steps backwards.
---
If you're really worried about it and want to cover your bases, order an Ethernet cable and connect to your router, if possible.   All three consoles in my house are and I ordered my cables from Monoprice. A 100ft Ethernet cable for $13(3x). So it was $40 total, but worth it for the length and connection.
---
But he's really fun
---
*Laughs in Amanda.*
---
At least teachable Iron Maiden is useful on Huntress.
---
Or just give him a new power altogether since they just removed his current power with this update
---
Really? Any links to the teases?
---
People are upset because they made the killer borderline useless.
---
Yup. Exactly. Not to mention Iron Grasp more than hard counters it
---
Though they did make them 4.6, meaning your power is no longer stab 16 times in a chase, it's more focused on injuring and stalling a lot of people before using regular chasing to down one.
---
I don't like that it seems like their power does nothing in a chase though, what's the point of vaulting pallets if the hits can't down now? After the initial hit you're literally just trapper with no traps.
---
It sounds like frenzy hits don't chop down the deep wound any more, so what does Franks actually do now?
---
It's less about the money and more the fact that I'm kinda mad about this &gt;.&lt;.
---
WELP TIME TO GRIND
---
oh my fucking god its happening
---
You don't understand, they literally ruined the game /s
---
Thanks! And not to make excuses (now you 100% know I'm making excuses lol) but I think that other than the definitely-small thumb, they might just seem small because they're clenched and the fingertips are bent over, which is why the fingernails are visible? Either way, if the Clown leaves my fingers alone I wouldn't object lmao
---
Interesting that there aren't so many Meyres. I feel like I get him quite often.
---
Yup. He‚Äôs my main killer and I thought I was gonna hate him at first, but he‚Äôs my favourite and best killer now. The information he gets is extremely strong, plus the filter for the dream world makes it much easier to see survivors even when awake.
---
i‚Äôve never been happier for a killer to get dumpstered.
---
sucks that they fucked up adepts because i‚Äôd have it by now.
---
That's no reason to delete the channel though. People can still watch the stuff he made in the past.
---
I've only just seen this haha, thats dope man
---
I would suggest playing the PTB and then providing feedback. They could fix issues if you give them constructive feedback.
---
I'll be honest. I quit when Legion was released (as a killer main) because I didn't like where the game looked like it was heading.
---
Even I think the dude got gutted. I mean you still have a faster first strike, but once they're injured you're playing an m1 killer.
---
Between losing the multiple strikes, the full charge requirement on frenzy, not being able to cut on the bleed bar, missed attacks draining your ability, move speed buff... Fuck, I'm literally listing the whole change list other than the anti-moonwalk thing.
---
Never thought I would feel sorry for legion.
---
Yea let‚Äôs just ignore the ranks too right lmao..

Legion rewarded tunneling, and it caused people to use the power in a way it wasn't intended (hitting multiple people). They changed it so it's more likely to be used as it was designed to be, so the people that played it piss poorly are mad.
---
TO BEGIN
---
Second time in DBD's history that this perk appears in the Shrine. It's been more than a year.
---
They put the words, "MERCILESS KILLER" on your screen.
---
bruh i havent played in 8 months and im about to be able to get back into DbD and IM CONCERNED OOF
---
never used decisive a day in my life
---
To be fair, spirit beads spirit is terrifying
---
I find that incredibly hard to believe, but okay
---
Pepper pepper fo fepper
---
okay
---
It has been more then 2 years since bbq and chili... TAKE IT WHILE ITS HOT!
---
Mm hmm.
---
This is one of the best shrines I have ever seen lol
---
Was considered extremely underpowered by manchildren that sucked at the game and expected 8 ez kills*
---
I‚Äôve played legion like 3 times in the time since his release, but I have more than 2 brain cells so I can see the devs fucked up this ‚Äúrework‚Äù and completely nerfed him into oblivion. If they were going to essentially delete his power in this update they could have at least given him a new one.
---
This shrine of secrets is hype af
---
I can't stop laughing. omggg
---
Clown is mid tier. Freddy is not. Bubba with acceleration addons is mid tier.
---
I remember when I played at Rank 20.
---
He need some nerfs but not like this! He is just an M1 killer now with almost no power. 
---
Also with this rework what are his add-ons gonna be now? Add-ons to give him some of the power he once had before the Nerf?
---
The ruined the game because they changed a killer, who's vast livelihood has been consistent of awful bugs, un fun gameplay, and nothing but complaints. You paid $7 for a map, killer, survivor, and perks. Its more than worth.
---
well, I get what you mean. But who am I to judge. this kind of shows focused on drama anyway so yes they are being extra.
---
The problem was with his power, but they solved it by removing his power and making him a M1 killer. They need to give him a new power
---
~~NSFW when?~~
---
Feral frenzy being able to down people is stupid. Legion can vault windows and pallets and get hits on people no matter what they do, he has no counterplay in a chase. That's one of the major reasons why people utterly despise playing against him, he sucks all the skill out of any chase. Once he hits you once, you are on a timer.
---
The power is useful, you can get multiple people injured at once , your first hit in a chase is guaranteed if you don't swing mindlessly and it also makes people gamble with their healing. If they don't heal then they are injured against a 115% ms killer and are an easy down, if they do heal they need to mend, and you can get them injured really fast. If you run things that slow down mending/healing that's even better.
---
&gt;Too bad you can't down them, literally ever until they run out of pallets.
---
Unless you are facing the best players every game you will be able to get hits on them on those loops and between those loops. Most survivors make a lot of mistakes in chases. Yes if you make mistakes and they play everything well then of course you will lose, but that's the case with every killer. You aren't facing perfect survivors like, ever. So you will get hits on them, like any other m1 killer.
---
Plus why are you complaining about pallet looping? It's the main way the survivors can ever slow down the killer's advance. Pallets and loops are literally their only way of defending themselves, you think Legion being able to ignore them completely and downing you with no counterplay is any good or balanced or good to play against?
---
&gt;Nurse, Huntress, and Hag.
---
Huntress can still get looped, you just need to play around her differently. There is a lot of loops she can't throw over, you can mindgame her winding up at pallets (at which point it's a matter of skill) and most of the maps suck for her anyway. She can still get looped, she just has more options that most killers. Plus she takes a ton of skill to get good at, something Legion doesn't need at all.
---
Hag can trap loops, yes. But you can also take advantage of her doing so and simply leave the loop to get more distance. Rinse and repeat and you will waste a ton of her time. And she still gets affected by pallets, you can predict whether or not she's going to take the teleport to the other side of the pallet and drop the pallet accordingly. The survivor still has a lot of ways to outplay her, not to mention you can use flashlights to render her power useless.
---
Nurse has been complained about for years. She is up for a rework because of that. Her add ons are currently getting worked on. At least with Nurse you have to think where you are blinking, Legion doesn't take any thought at all.
---
&gt;Nurse is just legion if legion didn't have to hit you 4 times, Huntress is the same thing.
---
I don't want to be rude, but that's just straight up not true. Huntress takes a lot of skill and prediction and a lot of maps and in-game structures counter her (and you can still predict where she's going to throw and dodge her). Legion doesn't get affected by any of that.
---
&gt;So now the killer is just suppose to let survivors get away huh? 
---
No, I didn't say that
---
&gt;Let me guess, you think legion is a "time waster" now. 
---
You guessed wrong. I've said that you don't follow them in frenzy. If they are injured and bleeding then you don't want to use frenzy on them, they are already injured. Cancel the power, use your 115% movement speed and chase them normally.
---
He was garbage without his overpowered add one and there was too much people exploiting the moonwalk
---
Huntress isn‚Äôt free, only Hag and Doctor. Their respective survivor counterparts are available/unavailable as well.
---
And where did you get this lie?
---
The changes seem to ve for the better gameplay but against Legion, overall. Nobody has played it yet, so lets wait and see.
---
Nice Irn Bru crest above him. That'd make for a good healing item, single use instant heal bottle of the ginger stuff.
---
Right? Jason was a monster with his star wars force grab
---
Playing the game since release
---
Actually it's from a game
---
I main counselor
---
Ok and you forgot to say "I considered jason weak" jason was not as bad as he is now.
---
So they ARE doing a test. Good I thought they were going just to roll the changes and be done.
---
Well no more buying dlc for me. It‚Äôs too risky that your character becomes useless.
---
Sorry, I was being sarcastic lol. I agree it's kinda petty to ask for a $7 refund over balance changes that nobody has even seen yet.
---
You gotta give him credit tho, he was the most broken character ever to be released, being both stupidly powerful when exploiting, and dumbfoundingly weak when played normally.
---
Of course this happens after I bought the dlc during the sale and spent a bunch of blood points leveling LF. RIP @ me. Congrats to all the people who didn‚Äôt already have it tho.
---
What are you on about?
---
&gt;Legion was already unfun to play
---
So why the fuck were there people playing Legion? Somebody clearly enjoyed playing him.
---
&gt;Rewarding you with tons of kills
---
More like tons of dc's. I have never seen a legion 3k
---
&gt;And also would be terribly weak
---
He always was
---
&gt;People want to toy with killers that gives them fun
---
If he's unfun to play then why are you crying that Bhvr is preparing to rework him?
---
&gt;face a killer they must be stealth against
---
Yeah right. Stealth against a killer that becomes a heatseeking missle after a frenzy hit. 
---
&gt;Congratulations to survivor mains for killing another killer
---
Im very fucking proud I killed legion with my tears. If somebody refuses to learn basic mechanics of the game and choose to ruin other's fun because they want to farm points with a broken killer, they can fuck right off. Sorry not sorry I killed this bag of shit
---
Theres no way theyre gonna be useless.
---
Canadian price, shoulda specified
---
Patience paid off.
---
I wound up enjoying him in the end of that very same grind lol. Just hate that chainsaw cant be kept winded
---
I was ok with that... But not with stacking more and more nerfs onto nerfs. It took little skill to hit a target if you can spam right click without consequences.
---
Tried playing it but the recent updates caused FPS problems for me again, feels sad.
---
The thing that missed atacks will stop frenzy is too much, maybe reduce the time would be enought. But BH can't do small changes, have to throw in the garbage. Poor legion, still hate this shit tho.
---
Not against 2+ counselors communicating even slightly lmfao
---
Agreed. I should clarify - at this point I don't bother differentiating.  But BT was definitely better off the way it used to be.
---
Yup. I play Legion without add-ons and bought cosmetics for them. Now we're shit out of luck.
---
Yesterday I got mad because I realized it was 9k, not 7k as I thought, to get a new character. I was going for Feng because of this perk. Now I will get lithe, bamboozled and BBQ for only 6k shards LOL
---
You could take a page out of the Survivor playbook and rally killer mains to leave lots of negative reviews on their steampage. Survivor mains did way back when BHVR started mentioning DS changes.
---
And then they completely fucked them over to the point of nobody wanting to play him
---
Sounds like hardly an achievement, but at least you can actually get it now.
---
Read some really good character backstories like Adam or The Clown. The lore and backstories are way much more better than you think they are. I always love theorizing and talking about the lore.
---
Yea I know I shouldn't have gone into that locker to begin with, but he honestly wasn't playing that well anyways.
---
This also ended with me running right through the gate to the outside. Nothing I did let me escape so he still got the kill.
---
Who?
---
Legion is both bad and unfun to play against. The rework is to make legion so bad that he might as well not exist. It is not hypocritical to dislike both of these states.
---
Not your fault, we both use dollars.
---
Because they nerfed him to below Freddy because I guess they want to go back to fucking killers in the ass. Granted, legion did need changes, but BHVR went completely fucking overboard.
---
I 100% agree with you on this. When played normally he was one of the worst killers. When exploiting with him he was unbearable. These changes just make him even worse for everyone who plays him - not just the exploiters...
---
Memes aside, If there would be a killer that uses chests somehow or a perk, what could it be?
---
\-Aura or notification alert when someone interacts with the chest maybe\`?
---
Lol good to know. Guess when I want to be a dirty bag I‚Äôll join play a Survivor match and leave right at the start.
---
He has 14k subs I‚Äôm not that surprised.
---
He‚Äôs this guy who made really good dbd memes. His content was fairly short but was really good.
---
Be horrified of the fact that you will never attain such perfection. True terror is seeing what cannot be attained.
---
&gt;not seeing survivors anymore kinda defeats the purpose of switching targets.
---
He can‚Äôt see blood or scratchmarks in Frenzy. He can still see other survivors.
---
Well one of us is gonna have to struggle on the first hook üòè
---
its so true, it hurts
---
I can break down what makes Mettle Of Man so good. In its worst state, you get one extra hit, and in all cases that‚Äôs amazing. Even if you get tunneled off hook by an M1 with it it‚Äôll give you a bit more breathing room to try to run away. 
---
In the way I use it, I force killers with extra methods of damage to basic attack me with body blocking. This is where I think Mettle Of Man is strongest. By forcing a killers hand to hit you by body blocks, you can trigger it on your second hook, and also potentially save an ally/get ez WGLF stacks. 
---
In its best case you can have a free health state for no downside. This is done by using a purple Insta Medkit, run Mettle Of Man, Adrenaline, Dead Hard And Deliverance/DS. Run the killer as much as you can, taking hits and getting injured but heal yourself to 99%. When the killer comes to you, heal back to full, run until you get Mettle Of Man ready, take the free hit, use the insta heal, take two more hits to go down and either get off the hook with Deliverance or get saved and DS the killer if you go down, but never heal yourself after you use MoM because the aura reading only occurs after you heal up. So stay injured and do gens until you get Adrenaline popped, and run to the exit cause at that point who cares if the killer can see your aura when you‚Äôre leaving the match?
---
Just refund it
---
Spirit is easily the most powerful/high tier DLC that cost money
---
Clown, Hag, and Myres are all very strong as well 
---
(Legion is dead with the new nerf and I'm not sure about Plague)
---
If you want strong teachable perks:
---
Hag - Hex: Ruin
---
Leather face - Barbecue &amp; Chilli (on the shrine right now)
---
Wow, I mean... I understand your excitement over making a good play and all, but you could've at least waited until AFTER recording before you started fapping... to each their own, no kink shaming, just saying it was an indecent way to end the vid is all. /s
---
:P
---
Dammit. Nicely played lol.
---
You haven't even played with the rework yet stop being annoying
---
Run. RUN AWAY!
---
hahahahahahah god these devs are the worst
---
RUUUNNNNNNNNNN
---
Just like the old gypsy woman said...
---
TBH I don't even use bbq for the aura reading most of the time, I usually just want the 4 stacks for double bp. Half the time I don't even pay attention to look for auras since I've already got a plan like going to pick up a trap, or set down a trap.
---
There's 100k subscribers here. So 80% would leave 20 thousand people angry, here alone.

Say 1% of those even comment. That's 200 angry comments in this thread.
---
Reddit != 1 voice
---
Nobel prize Harry!
---
I am one of the minority in terms of Legion players but I welcome the changes.
---
They definitely went really far in making him a super weak killer with the nerfs, but he was broken before. So, I'd rather have him be weak than broken.
---
Intresting and freddy is where?
---
I mean she has some long fingers so she could do some exploring of her date
---
Perhaps
---
ISN'T IT
---
If it's laggy that won't work
---
1 down, 4 to go.
---
I agree, let's just take an obviously bias survivor main and his group populus to show how legion isnt completely gutted, through Twitter likes.
---
I like *slowly* turning towards it. It's just like, "I know you're in there..."
---
Thank you for your sacrifice
---
I've started using Bamboozle on Leathface and its so much fun when they don't expect it and get chainsawed at double T walls. :D
---
What are the other 4?
---
What's the best killer and perks to farm bloodpoints?
---
Thanks for the info
---
And tell me how Legion would actually kill people without Frank's Mixtape. By hitting them 4 times? M1ing with 110%?
---
I understand how bad Legion is, so when I am not running his good add-ons, I just go for first hooks. It's all you have time for.
---
Man, you've done nothing but piss all over everybody in this thread with your utterly valueless shite. Go away, for real.
---
For me it's whenever they sabotage my traps. That is an automatic death warrant.
---
At least one person will usually dc immediately in any legion game. In my last legion game three people dc'd immediately after seeing which killer it was and the killer let me get the hatch. This does not happen against killers like Nurse who also don't have much counter play and who are very frustrating to play against if the killer is good. This happens because Legion is not fun to play against regardless of whether or not you are winning. If you get beaten by a great Spirit player you think "damn I got outplayed". You don't think that coming up against Legion, you just think about how idiotic the killer design is from the ground up. Legion in its current form is bad for the game and needed to be dealt with. Frankly I think a killer that can jump over pallets is game-breaking regardless and I'd be happy to see that disappear from the game.
---
It tends to force pallets or get them to go to another loop and saves tons of time.
---
They are playing Legion before he becomes trash
---
No.
---
well, freedy won't be his trash mate soon. going to get lonely legion ):
---
Take out to a nice dinner and after Chat. After many dates hit it like a CAVEMAN!
---
Lol, they should nerf them harder
---
Why?
---
It could also be that the killer‚Äôs internet just stuttered. It sometimes happens to me. I feel so bad because I‚Äôm stuck on killer until I can get a survivor game through my infinite load screens.
---
If they DC mid animation you actually still get points *and* the +625 quitter bonus.
---
Imagine thinking that DC‚Äôing and screwing over your team is a good thing to ‚ÄúoWn ThE lEgIoN‚Äù
---
Goddamn it, that was me clapping for myself I thought I cut it out.
---
oh man, that makes the legion totally trash (well at least even more than it was before) well there goes to the trash all that money for suzie skin :(
---
Yes but the thing is, if it was just the killer's internet stuttering then it would have been only temporary. This lasted for the entire match. It's not like people were warping about or anything. It just looks like they were constantly being stopped mid-sprint. You'll notice what I mean when I put the video up
---
Have a great night!
---
Lol, don't quit your day job.
---
Legion has tracking too, you can see everyone in your range with your frenzy.
---
Also Freddy has all of the other negative aspects of his power, so not hitting people with his power for 7 seconds, how easy it is to wake up from his power, how several perks straight up make him worse (including some killer perks).
---
I'd let her call out to evil spirits to enact ritualistic revenge on me any time.
---
that's... very bad. "remove nurses's blinks" level bad...
---
Imagine comparing Legion to killers like Huntress... Lmao.
---
The video is up
---
I kind of disagree, SWF can dick on Freddy but I dont think they dick on him any harder than most other killers. Killers that I say a SWF would completely dick on are Trapper and Plague. Freddy is completely mid tier for me, below Mike and above Pig.
---
It was better off in terms of being healthy overall*
---
It is no doubt stronger as it is right now.
---
Dont forget the great stall he gets as well, especially with dress addons.
---
***thonking sun gif intensifies***
---
Yeah. I‚Äôve experienced that on the survivor end, but it was less lag switching and more that the killer had a bad ping. Do you use MLGA to get killer pings?
---
Two words: Rank reset. 
---
If you wait a couple of days after it to play Killer, they get so bad. It's a little easier to regain your rank if you give it about three days or so of not playing Survivor. That way everyone kinda falls back into their rightful ranks and you have easier path back into yours.
---
I, imo, feel this will be a refresh for the Breakfast Club. Yes, at first I was angry but the more I think about it this will be a needed change.
---
i think dlcs arent refundable
---
Sorry for having a different opinion.
---
Yup. Honestly I play him with no add ons when I don‚Äôt have red paint brushes lol. I feel like I don‚Äôt really need them ahaha
---
Mostly a killer on Xbox but play survivor every so often. I've put about 700+hrs into this game and Xbox and this is just my opinion but 100% I will say this game is the most toxic game I've played. 
---
I'm not about witchhunting, but I do know on xbox there's about 3 super toxic survivor mains who literally promote extreme toxicity in the community, as I said I won't name them on the forum but if you've played killer around ranks 1-10 you probably know who I'm talking about.
---
Worth noting whether I win or lose I'll always send a gg. I just wished there was a chat like feature like the pc because that would make it a lot easier.
---
You play how you need to, keep digging along and I'm sure you'll find either lenient killers or nice survivors who aren't about playing toxic and acting salty all the time. As you said though the game is fairly competitive, but....most of the nice dbd players I know have nearly moved on from dbd because there's nothing really worthwhile in ranking up to the lower ranks, like sure maybe the first time you get to rank 1 it's an achievement but unfortunately after that it's repetitive as fuck, against the same killer or survivor literally every match on Xbox.
---
Lastly, you will no doubt get toxic messages most times, especially if you're against a swf team. It's important to ignore them without replying because one little slip and they'll report you and you could possibly get a comms ban. As I said above, play how you play but not toxic on either side and naturally you'll filter out the toxic stuff and possibly find nicer people in the community.
---
We needed a change, but this is a neutering
---
unpopular opinion: freddy is not the worst (probably top of the bottom tier or bottom of mid) but his flaws are more notable making him look much worse than he is
---
Can‚Äôt wait for a survivor nerf so we can shove it in your face too
---
Noice.
---
7 second fedora man bad lol
---
They increased it to be the standard price of single characters. Yes an increase obviously sucks, but it has been 500 cells since cells came out so they were just fixing the 4$ dlc price vs the standard cell price for characters.
---
she is so cute
---
I don‚Äôt think this killed Legion, it just changed the focus of FF it‚Äôs now much more about keeping up in the chase and less about applying deep wounds.
---
You don't tunnel gens, you just do gens.
---
If you only go after one guy, the other 3 have a ton of free time doing generators. You want to spread pressure on different people.
---
lmao you right
---
I... I can finally change my flair.
---
But. To what?
---
Clown has no map pressue and his powers help him slightly in chases. Bubba has no map pressue and a smart survivor wont be running in the open in a place where chainsaws can easily be hit
---
No you won‚Äôt get the killer unless you pay another 9k shards
---
It‚Äôs a joke bro. I love the lore
---
Alright thanks
---
You are setting up a straw man. Either that or you are not looking at the or their side with an open mind. 
---
I am disappointed that the power is useless after the first Frenzy. That makes Legion not unique and boring. Just an M1 killer. MAYBE the add-ons can change this, but we will have to see. This is the issue killer players had in the first place. (The 4-5 hits to down someone was not satisfying) Killers want to use the power to down an enemy (Freddy and Legion were the only two that couldn‚Äôt and still can‚Äôt)
---
Legion‚Äôs problem still has not been solved from the survivor side either. The first hit is still free and mostly brain dead. Hit all the near survivors and tunnel the last one is the same strategy. That will still generate a huge amount of salt, especially now that Legion is faster. If the changes stay like this, you will get a lot of the really experienced killers using it like a no-mither build against survivors and they will call for more nerfs again. 
---
Legion needed a full rework based around a concept. From the trailers, it was hiding as a survivor and using surprise. That is not what we got.
---
Agreed.
---
I know what im buying
---
Play on console 10fps through the corn with a spinning survivor. "Fun gameplay experience"
---
Hag is arguably as good as huntress and spirit imo and stronger than Myers for sure.
---
I bought him 3 days ago but I didn't buy him for bbq so I'm not worried
---
Oof. Just grinded level 35 on Bubba.
---
You dont tunnel survivors, you just kill them.
---
If you dont go after that guy he can go work on gens making the same exact scenario if you dont tunnel. You want to get a survivor killed off ASAP for that early game pressure. It's a helluva lot harder to get gens done with 3 survivors than it is 4.
---
I agree BUT behavior overnerfed him and didnt know when to stop nerfing him. I think legion only needed Deep wounds QoL + 115%
---
Everyone‚Äôs goons go from DCing on legion to never DCing cause it‚Äôs gonna be the easiest escape of their life
---
Bleed out not happening in terror radius and mending pausing bleed out are literally the things that happened that fixed moonwalking?
---
&gt;frenzy no longer shortens bleed out, frenzy is canceled if you miss
---
Those are the things that add counterplay in chase. And they fix mixtape.
---
Larger terror radius, full charge needed and not seeing the blood are the only things that aren't needed. Everything else is literally the fixes for the things that are the problem.
---
Just got done with my 5th legion game today. People just trying to see how the rework plays probably
---
His only buffs are increased base movement speed. That's it.
---
A longer duration of FF means nothing if the speed itself is "significantly" slower. I can do more as a killer with speed than I can with duration. Faster means better chase potential, better gen &amp; map pressure.
---
Ample counters to mending and ample time to mend isn't a buff to Legion. It's a nerf to any reason to panic getting hit from him. He has to leave your area in order for your mending to begin ticking down. Not just leave you in a chase, but leave your area period. It's just a buff to survivors playing against him disguised as "rework". It's peeing on our heads and telling us it's raining. No smart killer is going to fall for this nonsense.
---
Increased base terror radius is a nerf to every killer except the Doctor. Nerf.
---
His power actually renders several perks useless. He's the only killer we can see that about. Nothing was done about this, in fact they made blood perks now useless with him as well. Nerfs all around.
---
Zero stealth capability, zero mind game capability, zero tracking capability. He's just some abdominal mix of Doctor and Pig and another killer who's secondary power doesn't power poses no serious threat except to reveal locations of other people in his terror radius.
---
It just saddens me. I escaped a Legion who had an Ebony and Franks. Tough playing against Legion, though, hopefully it won‚Äôt be anymore.
---
Rest in peace
---
Well deserved
---
That‚Äôs survivor mains for you
---
For newer people, this is a crazy good shrine... BBQ a S tier perk, Bamboozle is a good perk. BBQ is now 1.5 years old and Boozle nearly a year old. Clown isn't the greatest killer and kinda boring imo, so getting his best perk out of the shrine is really great.
---
Lithe is an ok perk, I'd rather level up Ming Mong, over buying this perk, since Alert is also a great perk.
---
I really have no thoughts on it because it would not really be fair since we have not even got to test it in the ptb coming up
---
I‚Äôm about 50/50 in wins and losses against them today. The ones that are bad are really bad. But a couple of them were scary good
---
It's been 84 years
---
They are gonna need to fix the shit out of him afterwards if they want him to be viable
---
Cant forget the 7 seconds lol
---
I knew that horse face would be jealous.
---
5 Survivors? Hmm...
---
Also, who is the person between Claudette and Meg supposed to be? Nea?
---
I think ur thinking of billy, bubba can keep his chainsaw winded, you just release to start it i believe
---
I would say Freddy is currently the worst, but post nerf Legion could be, not sure yet. The main issue I have with Freddy is his power just allows him to become a killer, you can just watch survivors finish gens, heal, escape, or really do anything while just standing there waiting for them to fall asleep. Without any add-ons he really struggles to keep up vs competent survivors. At best his power is a slight time waster or a free injure hit, also if you run Monitor &amp; Abuse you can get more mileage out of his aura ability. I will say however freddy can be very strong vs inexperienced survivors, considering his power is very confusing and has quite a bit depth to it. However, once you start ranking up, freddy's weaknesses will quickly become exploited.

---
I've had BBQ for at least a year now. I don't need shards.
---
Thank you.
---
That‚Äôs more like the wave of bugs about to smash the game. Not new content flooding players.
---
Yep. That‚Äôs the weirdest shit I‚Äôve seen.
---
Holy shit, some good news! The rework looks pretty good on paper, hope these changes will make him enjoyable to play as and against
---
Well...yeah. That's his power. That's like complaining that all plague players do is puke on people lol
---
Thank you for your opinion. So very much
---
Expect some Spirit cosplay in r/dbdgonewild.
---
Was playing against Legion ever really fair though? Survivors could dodge like 4 swings and still because legion hit 1 they would be able to extend chase.
---
"Omg legion is so broken he should be removed from the game or nerfed to the ground"
---
*bhvr does what the community wanted*
---
Community: *surprised pickachu face*
---
Yea I got gen rushed and everyone escaped, freddys not useful without perks
---
Could it be said too strong or made the killer one dimensional? Think about how Wraith needed Windstorm before the change
---
Some people actually think the new legion is worse than prebuff
---
This is so pure
---
Yet that's exactly what alot of killers intend to do with an Ebony Mori.
---
ü§î
---
True
---
And just go add to this survivors are pretty much going to be forced to heal against legion now since he‚Äôs a 115% killer. If you run into a group of survivors you‚Äôre going to force at least one person to mend and heal while you chase another. If not you can basically get a free first hit and have to chase like a basic M1 killer. This sub has got to chill until we‚Äôre able to play with these changes for a bit.
---
If only Lithe didnt drop your FPS on console to 0 so you're not running into walls after activating it pretty much wasting your advantage.

---
I think I get it. I usually try and stick with darker cosmetics for the survivors so I can blend in better.
---
Pallets are a hit-or-miss to me. I guess I should keep trying with them.
---
Strafing... the ranged killers are the Huntress and the Plague, so that's kind of situational. I get that.
---
I've only used 180s against the Nurse, because the lethargy afterwards is perfect to juke them without them knowing.
---
Sprint Burst perks... In my head, Lithe could be coupled with Quick and Quiet, and Dance With Me. Quick and Quiet to muffle the vault, and Dance With Me to hide scratch marks. Am I reading that right?
---
Ty. Not sure if she‚Äôs on here but I had to give appropriation somehow! :)
---
The thing about it though is yes, it was difficult to escape, but it lengthened chases, giving teammates time to work when people did that. It may suck to go against, but that can be claimed with pretty much every killer. I never saw a match against a Legion as unfair, since it just meant the team had to be better at stealth as a whole (or just avoid each other), neither of which were hard.
---
What the hell is this tier list?
---
You are doubting they can make him worse? You must be new around here
---
i feel like its more of a free first hit on one person or multiple people if they group at a gen then its just normal m1 killer after that. that plus map mobility from the longer time in feral frenzy will probably push him out of shit tier and into low mid tier. tbh i might actually play legion after this rework
---
Hag is B, huntress A and legion is at least B if not higher with use of exploits/ the right perks
---
Dude, we were getting a lot of posts from legion mains talking about how legion isnt as bad this week, like they enjoyed him or something
---
If you know how to run structures properly you can get it anyway. Bamboozle is just lazy way around if you don't want to learn structures.
---
Imo that makes it more boring.
---
How sad :(
---
Ikr, Clown is at least a B tier...
---
I‚Äôm used to getting nerfs to survivors. We can be happy for once. Even killer mains should admit that Legion was not well designed, the changes are bad however, but I don‚Äôt care.
---
Have you seen the legion rework?
---
Nice serious discussion
---
I mean I am shit with clown, but I know he is strong! Also Wraith higher than trapper?
---
BAD IDEA
---
Seems like freezing the timer while in radius would have been good enough to start with, alongside fixing the always extending mend timer.
---
Agreed
---
Trapper is an SS tier, thanks for pointing that out! imo he‚Äôs even better without the traps cause they never expect it.
---
Afaik the tutorial has you fail to escape and go into struggle, and I think some flavor-text mentions it being a bad idea and being better to await rescue.
---
Boil over is actually terrible. It doesn‚Äôt make wiggle out quicker, it just makes your wiggle move the killer side to side more
---
Please don't ever make that face again.
---
Doing gens, you?
---
I mean, what is bad for Legion could technically be considered good for the game, as Legion was considered by a large amount of the community bad for the health of the game.
---
I am a Legion main... soon to be retired *weeps*
---
Omg (omlettes make games) I cnat blevive that legen from dbd (dad be dead) is acshualy snas deltarune omg omg
---
i dont get those two words but ok
---
Huntress was made free on ps4
---
I never said Legion wasn't fucking broken fucking christ but the solution is not to ruin them good fucking god
---
So crazy thing just happened, played against a killer that tunneled like crazy, ignoring injured and downed people to go after the unhook. Get out of game, and the killer claims he‚Äôs the dev that designed the legion changes. I see if he‚Äôs steaming, cause surely a dev wouldn‚Äôt play like that. I see him facecamping in stream calling survivors bitches. 
---
Check reddit, it matches the name of a dev here. Legion makes a lot more sense now.
---
Your flavor texts are absolute gold
---
Spent my last of them on Surveillance the other week.
---
Glad I wasted money on Legion.
---
Reading it was like "Ok fair"
---
then the nerfs kept coming and coming.
---
They overdid this a bit.
---
this is so well made omg I love it
---
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs probably not an eb-‚Äú
---
*Second teammate is moried*
---
I don't consider giving a free hit as "being nice"
---
No no no no no, NOOoOoOOOooOoOoOoO!!!!
---
Because it's not an exploit. It's a part of the game. Why is it so difficult for people to understand this? That's not a fucking bannable offense. Scummy, yes, but not bannable. Not even lose.
---
I'm not complaining about Frank's Mixtape. I'm complaining about moonwalking, which has absolutely no counterplay. Hell, you don't even have to moonwalk half the time. If you break the chase once and just walk in the survivors direction, it doesn't always trigger a chase. They have the choice to mend and die or bleed out and die. Freddy and Legion are the only killers I play and I never understood why the bleed out timer goes down in the killers terror radius.
---
Freddy being above doctor and clown (tbh trapper is a pain to use) seems bizarre. I know Freddy isn't as bad as he's made out to be but I thought Doc can be more efficient at slowing the game down and blocking progress without having to worry about sleeping survivors.
---
Ashy slashy as merch imagine that
---
so your saying the new legion is well designed? hell I don't even play legion and I think it's unfair
---
Legion was unfair because he could basically trigger his power, run at you, and no matter how well you played you would go down.
---
Lithe, I spend most of my time running so burst is useless to me and balanced landing is too map dependent for my tastes.  I just suck at Dead Hard.
---
Legion is just shitty Billy now.
---
Think about it. Ability makes you move fast to get a hit. Except when Billy hits you it ACTUALLY DOES SOMETHING.
---
I don't even see the point of him anymore. 
---
He is basically a worse Pig without the Traps or Stealth and if you miss your opener you get stunned and lose your power bar.
---
You would be melted so quick if killers had a faster movement speed, imagine Myers on t3 he would just be slugging the whole lobby.
---
Haven‚Äôt changed that build since they raised her terror radius to 32. Sometimes I swap to Enduring spirit fury or end game.
---
Anakin: ‚ÄúThis is where the fun begins‚Äù
---
And what about the non-mettleofman players that get tunneled and camped? S:
---
When does the Legion update go live?
---
You have a point there.
---
Banning people for moon walking. That's the ticket right there mmhmmm.
---
Looking for post...
---
I'm a doc main and IMHO he can mine salt just as bad (if not worse) as Legion.
---
Frankly I find it amusing. Sure all the knee-jerk complaints (Some well deserved) got Legion nerfed into the ground, but would you rather go against Dr. Worldwide?
---
Interesting, l rarely use lithe because in my experience I usually find a weak window that ends up not getting me much distance from the killer. I love sprint burst but man not being able to run sucks
---
Legion was already weak as it is they just needed to fix a few things not dumpster him.
---
The entire concept of Legion's special power was broken to begin with. He needs a complete overhaul or his ability. Until that happens, deleting him from the game probably serves the best purpose for the greater good.
---
Its not a "small indie company" i hope you know this
---
Same here, Insidious basement LF was fun though for awhile
---
If day doc is easier to get bp with unless you‚Äôre a really good leatherface. I‚Äôm a bad doc but a good leatherface so I can get more with leatherface but it depends on your skill with the killer
---
Docs stall takes longer to apply and is harder to apply than Freddy, Freddys tracking is better and since Freddo is small he has better m1 mindgames which is why I put him there.
---
Lithe is very good, Boil Over is very bad
---
If you‚Äôre not running all the exhaustion perks together what are you even doing?
---
Iridescent Button. Got a direct buff too
---
Oh you sweet summer child...
---
To be honest, I'm not sure what the point of Feral Frenzy is after this particular change. Maybe it's meant to force people to go into frenzy, hit one survivor, and then ping pong to other survivors so you're not constantly stabbing the same survivor. I don't know.
---
BRO DON'T SAY IT, BHVR'S GONNA TAKE IT AS A CHALLENGE.
---
High effort! See you on the front page!
---
They nerfed them way to hard, they needed a rework but not one that just makes the killer unusable
---
How did he got you all down there in the first place? XD
---
Haha 10/10
---
I feel like they put bbq in shrine to placate us as damage control
---
You still got franklins and knock out

You know you've been commenting to every single person that waits at the gate for literally 10 seconds to be nice with you bs: or you could just leave??? I play killer plenty so I can have an opinion- most of the time I like it when I can get those free hits and blood points. You should stop being so forceful with your opinion when the preference is going to always be 50/50. You're not right or wrong so stop acting like survivors that wait for just a little bit to benefit the killer are horrible.
---
You can get 150k with like 3 games with bbq
---
Her sneak attack is [or at least was] better used for mindgaming and shutting down pallet loops. If you used it to sneak up on people, you weren't playing Pig as effectively as you could.
---
Stings. Doesn‚Äôt it
---
It‚Äôs been a little over an hour and I‚Äôve been in 3 different games trying to play as Hag.
---
All three games and the Survivors quit/suicide on hook after things don‚Äôt go perfectly for them. I‚Äôm wasting all my good Add-Ons and stuck just farming with the one/two people who decide to stay in the game solely just because I feel bad for them.
---
We really need harsh Quitting penalties. Leaving a game with 5 Gens left just because I found you first/you fucked up your pallet stun/whatever is annoying. I can‚Äôt practice or have fun in the game when this is happening **constantly**.
---
If more than 2 people quit, let everyone in-game keep their items. Or offerings. Or something, because I honestly don‚Äôt even want to play Killer right now if I‚Äôm just wasting my offerings.
---
How can I upvote this 50 million times?
---
I barely play survivor. Is lithe good? I‚Äôm currently running sprint burst, borrowed time, bond and def care on every survivor game
---
Of course I have, I'm not understanding where I said I haven't.  I'm saying I don't DC every time I see a legion. Hence why I said it's just a meme. You know, like a joke? I make memes I find funny and there's usually not more to it than that. So don't make it that way.
---
His power, by default, is auto annoying. I'd imagine that won't change, but he'll be even weaker.
---
Depends on my mood, but never SB
---
I‚Äôve honestly only seen posts about legion being broken, not fun, bad, but never enjoyable to play against. Most legion mains were sadists IMO
---
Is it shirtless myers?
---
I don‚Äôt believe it said you lose your power bar it just cancels it so it has to recharge from where it was. I easily could be wrong though
---
Community: NERF LEGION TO THE GROUND
---
Also Community: Man, poor killer, they nerfed him way too much.
---
i loved his videos, i wish he wouldnt delete the channel.
---
How big is Myers terror radius in tier 2 with dead rabbit and monitor?
---
2 things that I wonder
---
1. Where did he get that?
---
2. How the hell does he play it with crab claws
---
He needed a Nerf but not like this.
---
Your correct on that! It‚Äôs all on the management of the place, but I‚Äôve been in the corporate world long enough to know this, the only thing they care about is profits and how to keep them coming in. I‚Äôm fine with that, you wanna make money, but corporations normally just say fuck the client or customer and sell them something. Then your quality goes down the drain and people will soon go elsewhere if given the option. Look at Windstream communications, you know who they are if you live in the USA, they are in chapter 11 right now.
---
He god himself
---
Time to use the Mori and might as well use my mix tapes
---
DWIGHT PIZZA HOODIE
---
*MoM kicks in, leading to your escape*
---
Why? I use sprint burst all the time and I have to say the only negative about it is that you have to walk rather than run to avoid burning it
---
Thank the entity that i allready have it.
---
Yes.
---
That feels like they don‚Äôt have much to it yet. Like mentioned above it was promised a year ago, and then it was brought up again when DS nerf was hinted. And now they‚Äôre saying wait another month. It feels like an excuse I would give to someone when you haven‚Äôt done your part of a group project. Maybe I‚Äôm just being too pessimistic.
---
They‚Äôll change the achievement
---
You literally called me bad because I said Legion can't get kills without moonwalking (or Frank's mixtape). So I ask again, how do you get kills without breaking chase as Legion?
---
See you in the front page sir
---
no. it was  2 years ago
---
&gt; anything. I'm surprised they're swinging so hard with changes here if this is all they got left
---
Nah, they got their switch port and whatever the next content DLC and skins that will drop in 3 months that will just break and unbalance more shit they can toss into the pile of "working on"
---
. Bug fixes and balance issues are back burner bullshit. I mean fuck, how long have SWFs been in the game, yet they still balance the game around 4 randoms being matched up together with no ability to communicate and force killers to play within those boundaries.
---
Maybe Legion can utilize uReLenTiNg well because of the missing an attack change in feral
---
Sis they‚Äôll still dc lmao
---
y
---
Finally getting that BBQ!
---
Yes, please burn through all your offerings while people will still DC, and you can get next to zero bloodpoints! 
---
Seriously? What‚Äôs a waste. 
---
‚Äúlet‚Äôs make survivors regret what they made‚Äù
---
Kid, you and the other no-brain Legion ‚Äòmains‚Äô made this when you exploited how stupidly OP he was. 
---
Deal. With. It. 
---
Stop. Crying.
---
Good for them
---
If they keep disconnecting there are more chances of them getting banned
---
Leader's pretty okay, but it only really works best in SWF with coordination.
---
You can grind for it if you want to but it's not exactly required to win or anything like that. It's only really ever useful against really shitty windows. Also sets really bad habits. Better learn how to mindgame, more useful for the long term.
---
Agreed. I'm not entirely sure why people are this upset over the Legion changes.
---
/r/thatHappened is that way ---&gt;
---
Amen to our brothers and sisters who just bought leatherface and got BBQ
---
"Legion bad reee! He's better off deleted than in mah vidya gaim!"
---
&gt; Name of dev?
---
Albert "legion" Einstein.
---
Good thing BT only really works when we tunnel some lad right off the hook and none of us is such a killer, right? ;)
---
He looking like he boutta backhand her xD
---
Frenzy move speed is also decreased significantly. Why even use the power if you walk the same as your run, except when using your power you can‚Äôt even down survivors. Wtf are these changes, devs/balance team just gave up and wanted to preserve what public image they have.
---
I knew as soon as I got Leatherface to 40 they would do this. I got him to level 40 last weekend and Wahla! They put BBQ in the Shrine. FeelsBadMan
---
They've said it's the most comprehensive thing that they've done in a killer after they've been introduced.  It sounds to me like it's likely to be done when the next chapter is released.
---
Why change a killer for one person complaining?

Hmmm, thanks
---
is this a fuckin joke?
---
Press F for our brothers and sisters who just bought leatherface for BBQ
---
But there is. You get a free hit to start a chase and can waste some people‚Äôs time if you‚Äôre lucky enough to have survivors bunched up. That was essentially the devs premise behind legion in the first place. The power itself is just fucking stupid and should‚Äôve never been created and now there‚Äôs really no other way to go with it besides completely reworking the legion which the devs don‚Äôt seem to intend on doing. 
---
Depending on what the exact numerical changes are to frenzy speed, length and add on changes it‚Äôs a power that can be used for extra mobility, a free hit and a time waster on top of having a base movement speed. Legion is not going to be a top tier killer but that‚Äôs ok. At worst he‚Äôs gonna be bad but he‚Äôs not gonna be absolute garbage.
---
BHVR just fucked up bad with the Darkness Among us Chapter. Legion being the big idol of it all.
---
That needs to be the name of one of his perks. I don't care what it does, I just want it.
---
Glad you brought it up actually! In that case, what's the best way to attempt to do it before they change it?
---
Press m1 to pick a killer perk that can be destroyed during anytime of the match
---
They addressed this in the official post in the comment section. They‚Äôre gonna change so it‚Äôs just downing 25 Survivors affected by Deep Wounds. Should be much easier.
---
I mean tbf spirit is definitely up there on the tier list, maybe the ordering is a little wrong but they can‚Äôt clearly be declared better than one another.
---
You're not, and you shouldn't be punished. The devs can easily fix this by letting survivors move through killers.
---
Don't know who downvoted you but I'm upvoting to ward them off. You took the words right out of my mouth.
---
Yea I cant understand it but I feel like theres always those killers that mindlessly camp and tunnel
---
Basic M1 killer with a very easy first hit, who can hopefully still body block while stunned. I think it‚Äôs a great change, let‚Äôs me play them how I played them at release. Easy hit, body block, tag them down.
---
Good
---
And now DS is a much better perk? I'm not seeing the comparison
---
https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/the-fallacy-fallacy
---
Let's try coming up with a real argument then? If you want to play the logical fallacy game, at least donut right, you wannabe lawyer.
---
thanks mr /u/Storkostlegur
---
Uwu
---
Where the gates open? The other guy could have crawled out given the amount of time this jake could have ran this billy
---
They hated him because he spoke the truth.
---
üòÇ
---
We all will miss papa's memes. Why tho, he should leavr his channel up, so we could still enjoy his work.
---
Lol yeah, PTB seems like an illusion of choice. We ‚Äòget‚Äô to make our voices heard but nothing really changes. Who wants to bet that Legion will be played less than Freddy after these changes go out because all these nerds are added?
---
Eh I get your concerns, and yeah, Freddy's ability right now its extremely worthless, all you get are auras and delays before you can hit people.  But it shouldn't be THAT much longer before we get at least an idea of what they're doing so try to be optimistic.
---
No you arent for playing the game and using flashlights the way they are meant to be used, its just really bad play on her part, she should have faked the pick up or anything since its really easy to counter flashlights/pallet saves these days
---
The game is for everyone, not yours
---
This is wrong. They ban people for abusing the blade addons which would give umreal mending times.
---
I also don‚Äôt think you will get banned for doing this once or so but rather if you‚Äôd do it excessively.
---
That doesn‚Äôt mean they should leave a mistake in the game though. I mean come on think about it, you miss and just get to keep swinging? It‚Äôs just stupid. This, the terror radius stopping the deep wound timer, and not being able to down in frenzy are all good and needed changes. The rest though like slowing frenzy and not seeing the blood doesn‚Äôt seem necessary though. Those other changes address the issues enough  (moonwalking and the lack of skill ez tunnel with no counterplay)
---
He was incredibly unfun to be in a game with, either side, and took no skill. I wanted to see a rework, or a fix, not a "let's just make it a killer without a power so we can ignore them for 4 more years."
---
I was just about to by Leather face too. Rip to everyone who did
---
I didn‚Äôt want to say but hell I posted a video of the conversation so no use hiding, almo2001. He had a comment on the legion post as well that talked about the achievement changes
---
It means he can chase without using frenzy. Frenzy can't be used to tunnel now. You seem very uneducated about legion
---
Yeah I hope so.
---
Inaccurate, he still has one good leg in this image.
---
Head on
---
I  made it out with Deliverance while being camped and wearing the head trap. The hatch popped in front of me. The salt was real. 
---
Its all situational. Since I was last one left and I knew it was worth the try, I went for it. 
---
Otherwise, you want to buy time for the team to do  gens/gate/get you down. Hopefully you're with a capable group.
---
This episode of spongebob was sad :'(
---
Are you referring to when the plague gets her corrupt purge from a fountain?
---
Hi, just a reminder that Rancor is a thing
---
Until you realize they made him unusable...
---
But the base speed is faster. They slowered one and fastened the other
---
What are you talking about?!?!? /s
---
Ability makes you powerwalk while not actually being able to down someone, sounds neato.
---
Kinda looks like he‚Äôs 15 here
---
They need to just give legion a power that actually coincides with their theme. Let them mimic survivors, teleport around the map by using lockers (one gets in at one point then another gets out at another point), or have NPC legion sentries that call out survivors to the main killer.
---
Not when you're straight garbage with him.  Thanks for the support though.
---
I like to bring cypress to try and mind game or scare survivors, they usually get more use that way anyway.
---
5 weeks and still give to me already opened perks thx behavior
---
Don't think he's a DbD dev considering that he uploads so often and has so few views.  
---
He's probably an impersonator, don't think I've ever seen a dev that looked like that either.
---
They can only vault while in FF, which can't down a survivor anymore, so that's a moot point.
---
Will it with pallet looping? üßê
---
oh is that what it is, I think the killer was the plague, lol so many sounds i dont know cause I dont have the killer. Thank you!
---
Advanced shitposting, nice job OP.
---
We need more people like you in this sub.
---
Happy? This community? 
---
...Buddy, where exactly do you think you are?
---
lol, everybody complaining now were asking for legion to be removed. he wasn‚Äôt even powerful in the first place just unfun, but this subreddit complained so bad they gutted Legion. Now the sub complains it was too hard of a nerf. Maybe try conveying that he can be unfun to play against instead of asking for his immediate removal every other post.
---
On one hand I agree, but at the same time I can‚Äôt count the number of times where I‚Äôve escaped a legion, started mending in a decently hidden spot, got to the very end while he searches for me, and have had to let go and get downed at like 90% because it decreases outside of chases. 
---
It absolutely shouldn‚Äôt tick down in TR because of moonwalking, but I‚Äôd also accept it not ticking down while you mend. This may be a bit overkill, but something needed to change. Hopefully the changes that are good are separated from those that are bad in the PTB
---
Lack of money and time I suppose. $28/month in patreon money is not enough compensation to make dbd meme videos.
---
Thanks, I‚Äôm gonna ask a stupid question again. So the fact it says ‚Äúaccumulative bonuses don‚Äôt exceed 100%‚Äù shouldn‚Äôt that mean healing perks wouldn‚Äôt stack?
---
Rework doesn‚Äôt mean nerf.
---
Apparently that‚Äôs hard to understand. I want a rework not a nerf.
---
That‚Äôs like every law ever passed in the history of mankind lol
---
I don‚Äôt understand the negativity... don‚Äôt you know what this means? No more immediate DCs when people learn it‚Äôs a legion, and NO MORE MOONWALKING. Someone grab the goddamn champagne
---
Tunneling, when you target one survivor until they die. Most Freddy mains do this.
---
Yeah that sound is when she gets her corrupt purge so you know
---
I *just* got BBQ on Bubba like 3 days ago.
---
Alright I hope to god that‚Äôs true
---
I don‚Äôt I go for whoever I can and hook them (if I can) then go look for others as they die
---
If you‚Äôre a good killer that gets a 4K you are automatically a camper that should uninstall and kill themself. I hate survivor mains.
---
OMEGALUL
---
Is this real? Bamboozle, Lithe and BBQ. Is this dream? Or just fantasy? The best shine ever.
---
I thought there was a lot to take in for a new player before.
---
It's very very likely that if the feedback continues this negatively they will revert most or at least some changes during the PTB. That's why they introduced the PTB in the first place.  
---
I just hope that we overshadow the "hood man bad" group so that these changes don't end up going through.
---
6 meters. Dead rabbit takes 1/4th of the terror radius, as it's 8m with monitor &amp; abuse
---
Yes I did actually I really never DC. Was having zero fun at rank 1-5 so I tanked down to Rank 15. Was banned the next day.
---
I honestly prefer to use my shards on cosmetics, since it's faster to farm bloodpoints to unlock the teachables
---
I still wouldn‚Äôt have seen it
---
Thanks Mate. They really shit the bed on this one. Legion was so easy to rework.
---
that was mean :(

---
The change to feral frenzy to stop the timer while in their terror radius is great but what the hell are literally all the other changes like jesus BHVR stop they're already dead!
---
Gaslighting other people is not an effective argument, nor is it a proper discussion.
---
Incredible, very well done
---
And some people pretend there‚Äôs no rhyme or reason (or gain) with this for the devs.
---
I think the Nightmare can sometimes be borderline impossible with the right addons, assuming the player playing him is decent at killer.
---
&gt; got called out on it, 
---
... And conceeded the point. I admit, he was right.  "Kay, buddy, I get it," I said. 
---
&gt; Are you sick in the head? 
---
Not a good way to engage someone or make a point unless your goal is undermine your integrity and come off as a dick, but I *will* give *you* the benefit of the doubt and just move on. Let's discuss - like civil, mature adults surely can - without resorting to childish ad-homs. Now then, allow me to explain. 
---
Balance, in the way we perceive it (relative strength, nerfs, buffs, etc.), does not always equate to game *health.* That it to say, some facet of the game (a killer, a perk, an add-on, etc.) can be "healthy" (or "unhealthy") - conducive (or not) to fair interaction and competition - regardless of whether that facet is considered effective or not. For example, if a survivor successfully out-maneuvers a Nurse, another killer that ignores the usual defenses of pallets and windows, by dropping line of sight and winning the "50/50 mixup" so to speak of "they kept running" or "they turned around", they do not get hit and perhaps even end the chase successfully. In this case, survivors are rewarded for mentally engaging with the killer and outwitting them. The opposite is true as well; if the Nurse guesses (or reads) correctly, they are rewarded for engaging the survivor by either injuring or downing them. With that in mind... 
---
Legion, as is currently on live (pre-PTB), is an example of an "unhealthy" design. Similarly to the Nurse, they ignore pallets and windows, however they do not get punished for getting outplayed nor does the survivor get rewarded for doing the outplaying. This is because the survivor has no way to counter Legion's power. There is *essentially* no opportunity in a chase to outplay a Legion.
---
A killer playing Nurse basically must use her power, a powerful but committal all-in movement tool that interrupts vision afterwards, to land hits and win, providing opportunities for survivors to outplay her in doing so. Meanwhile, a killer playing Legion can use their power to eventually down a survivor, regardless of what the survivor does, if they decide to invest the time; there is nothing survivors may use as leverage, and the decision lies solely with the killer. This is not fair, as one side of the competition has no opportunity to alter the outcome. Thus, this is "unhealthy." 
---
(I'll reply again later with an explanation of why I believe the proposed changes on the PTB address this issue).
---
Shame i wasted my "first dlc" trophy on them, rest in peace.
---
Aw you‚Äôre so kind üò≠üò≠üò≠ i been waiting for it tbh thank youu
---
I came this close to spending my shards the day before, but I held on to them just in case. Needless to say, I grabbed BBQ the second I heard. (now I just need to level a few times for Lithe)
---
not all heroes wear capes....
---
Jesus he is garbage now.
---
Yup BHVR have no idea how to balance their own game lmfao.
---
That was the last character I wanted but now it's on the shrine I don't need leatherface
---
Tis a sad shame my trophy of "first dlc" went poorly üòûüò≠
---
someone archive his vids
---
I mean what's the point of even existing if you don't get iridescent Unbroken.
---
Or, or, they could make him fun.
---
YAAASSSS FINALLY I CAN DESTROY HUMANITY WITH NURSE BBQ
---
Lmfao says you. You're constantly bickering at people on here.
---
The dudes clearly a troll and you're gonna defend him?
---
whoa.. I totally did not expect you to deliver. Updoot to you my dude and if that is actually a dev and not just some turd impersonating.. then you're right.. explains a lot about the state of the gmae.
---
I knew if I buy leatherface this will happen..
---
Rip papa Jake. I remember that ochido video and the super smash bros meme video he made. You will be missed generator Jake
---
Comprehensive list of things that are better off now that u/low_kix made his comment:
---
How I feel whenever I play killer in general tbh
---
With thunderous applause..
---
i can tell a joke from trolling, fam.
---
At this point they should remove deep wounds altogether
---
Balanced Landing, mostly cos it still has an effect while exhausted. Can be used to loop multi story buildings like the boat on Pale Rose and the House on Mother‚Äôs Dwelling for days.
---
Ayyyyyyy! Thanks for clearing it up, I have been eager to get this trophy and couldn't get it
---
Because they decided to heal like morons.
---
I main both...so there is no diference for me
---
Whatever you say, fam.
---
Never heard of him or watched his stuff. If it‚Äôs still up, anyone wanna shoot me a link to one of his (in your opinion) best works? I love being late to the party :/
---
This is honestly me when I run it lol I'm sorry
---
Np &lt;3
---
mods if i can get a "rated tubby" flair that would be grande
---
Huntress absolutely can get looped thanks to inconsistent terrain shitboxes making your hatchets collide with a ridiculous amount of clutter on some of the loops.
---
Was like 50 shards away from unlocking my first extra killer (other than purchasing Mikey), glad I didn‚Äôt get those extra 50 shards!
---
Honestly all they had to do was give legion a window after manually cancelling frenzy to get a normal hit in. Like maybe a quarter of a second.
---
I also split time between both and legion is my favorite. I never had to use any exploits. The fact that you could find other survivors by starting with an injury and then hit as many times as you could fit into the window was what drew me to them. Now the killer is a totally different person and I absolutely hate it. There didn't have to be so many nerfs to their power. Putting them at 115% movement speed is not a balanced approach to how much they got screwed by this new update.
---
The true "Darkness Among us" was the community.
---
I seriously fear people who can loop buildings with balanced landing. Oh God Haddonfield flashbacks
---
Rank Reset maybe? You‚Äôre playing against lower rank killer than you‚Äôre used to
---
Lithe.
---
Boil over doesn't really impact the killer that much.
---
Neither do I. So we won‚Äôt be negatively surprised but have the chance for a positive surprise, sounds good.
---
so many people who claimed being Legion mains said they like design and lore and just running around stabbing people. you can still do that lul or maybe all of them were lying and they only liked them cause it's hella easy to play Legion. cause i dunno as killer main i'd either take perkless Legion for dailies or to literally run around and stab people OR when i saw a confirmed toxic-looking swf of over 2 people and at that very moment i didn't want to fuck with them instead of dodging I'd quickly change to Legion, add some perks+add-ons and crash them because even without cheese and Frank's Legion is dumb braindead of a killer who will get kills even without playing like a cunt.
---
I find that shroud increases the chance they spawn next to a totem from 90% to 100%.
---
We said nerf him into the ground, not Batista Bomb him into *The Earth‚Äôs fucking mantle.*
---
you can't moonwalk with insidious, you have to stay still for it to work for a few seconds
---
hey man i get that everybody hates legiom but you dont need to act like im a lesser person for preferring a killer over the rest
---
The problem isn't that Legion got nerfed. It's that they likely went too far with it. The DS change had the same problem at first when the stun was inexplicably only 3 seconds.
---
1 week later "So I wasn't paying attention and missed BBQ on the shrine, BHVR y u do this 2 me? Put BBQ back on the shrine plz"
---
Guess more people got this trouble cause bhvr posted they are working to solve this exploit
---
I remember watching the first test play with the developers and (I think)Tru3... that damn boi said the speed was fairly decent for setting traps- I had never played her before the buff, but I lost my shit, seeing how slow she was before. And I *seldom* play without the green addon that makes placing traps faster. That‚Äôs crazy, mang
---
I use Dead Hard currently as I just unlocked it.  Sprint Burst is underrated.  I am a reforming killer main so my loops aren‚Äôt on point quite yet.  SB has ‚Äúsaved‚Äù me countless times by leaving the slower person behind when the killer shows up to a gen with other people working on it.
---
Thanks!
---
Yes, I‚Äôm not stupid, they removed the ability for the moonwalk to do anything, and with the increased terror radius being pretty much anywhere on the map makes deep cut useless. Thus insidious removes the terror radius meaning they can‚Äôt freeze deepcut at all
---
I dont use frank mixtape,i only add duration and speed for the frenzy,but legion was made to crash swf,but with most of these changes,he is a joke now. I love the salt,that is why i use doctor or legion...now he is just freddy....
---
This episode always made me upset as a kid.
---
(cypress are the ones that only work after you've already won)
---
I just wanted to say that this game deserves the 50% Review on Steam. I‚Äôm not a new player either, ive watched this game be updated to shit with cancerous killers like the stabby smiley guy dlc and the hag dlc. Killers being way too fast. And decisive strike being broken and never activating.
---
He's crying in a corner because he knows in time out forever.
---
mm, tasty.
---
not a Legion main but i used them for stress relief (no cheesy add-ons or chase abuse) cause they're dummy op. no perks, no add-ons i could easily get 4k on small to medium map like Chapel or Coal Tower. 
---
only thing i don't agree with about the nerf is larger terror. no idea why would they do that.
---
Baseball bat from Friday the 13th!
---
Look at how they massacred my boy.
---
The surprise would be:we will buff legion....in 4 years...now lets look this new skin of....
---
Y y‚Äôall not have bbq and chilli yetüòÇ
---
I love when people go through Reddit profiles for constructive criticism.
---
FUCK I JUST BOUGHT LEATHERFACE
---
yes. much easier than relying on survivors you get being complete potatoes
---
Agreed. People just play him wrong
---
 üòÇ the best thing on this post
---
Yea I‚Äôm very much aware lol. I can still want to support the game. It isn‚Äôt exactly triple A either lol
---
I'm sorry, but as he is now, his ability is just for people who can't play killer and need free unavoidable hits, then just go for an M1 for an easy down.  There aren't any other killers that were obviously designed to be ezmode.  Some of the nerfs may be overboard, but there is no skill required for him, and all of the others are more rewarding as a result.
---
There are 2 kinds of Leigon. The moonwalkers and the 28 stab wounds. 28 stab wounds is sad to see while moonwalkers are annoying to see. Now we don't get either of them.
---
as much as the nerfs were necessary, i don't think they needed larger terror radius.
---
Together with the Prayer Beads and Mother-Daughter Ring, I hope?
---
I said "if you need to moonwalk to get a kill" you are bad... never said anything about Frank's, which I couldn't care less about. I don't know you and I've never seen you play so I don't know if you moonwalk or not. Regardless, if you can't figure out how to get kills on Legion without exploiting the chase mechanics to get free no-counterplay downs, then I don't know what to tell you.
---
This is probably more of a temporary debuff, you over nerf the problem so that you can steadily add back power and see where the boundary is, it‚Äôs actually a pretty common strategy in moba games for hard to balance characters.
---
So this timing for BBQ 100% confirms it's not random.
---
Freddy: The weight of such a burden , it must be mine for there is no other .  
---
Legion: FREDDY !  You hold a grim destiny in your hands brother .  
---
Freddy: Legion ?  By all that is holy !  
---
Legion: The communities hate has sealed my fate ... the world of the living can no longer comfort me. Place the nerfs upon my head freddy.  
---
Freddy: No old friend , i cannot  .  
---
Legion: DO IT FREDDY ! you and the other killers have your own destinies to fulfill , this last act of service is mine .
---
"buff"
---
Yeah. I was grinding him while I got bbq on other killers, then I ended up liking him and now I'm a bubba main.
---
I with you dude. I‚Äôm a legion main, I hit rank1 without moonwalking or using Franks mixtape (not effective starts imo)
---
Now I feel my only option is to find a new killer to main. 
---
Nurse or spirit ain‚Äôt lookin to bad üëÄ
---
I don't feel bad!! Well deserved.
---
I don't believe there are any killer mains that play legion.
---
(obviously there are a select few that do play legion, but most do not)
---
Holy fuck... This was meant for another comment I was posting on? Whoops. Sorry mate
---
It's sad when someone gets exactly what they want only to realize they asked for to much.
---
&gt; He's no worse than most m1 killers are now.
---
That's still not a good thing, and I'm honestly struggling to see how he's any better than Freddy or Wraith now. Feral Frenzy has been turned into a "spam off cooldown" machine that only serves to travel around the map slightly faster. Freddy gets that for free already, as he doesn't have to *find* people. And Wraith moves fast, with no cooldown, and he's invisible. 
---
Like, this is kind of abysmal. He's like a convoluted Wraith without stealth.
---
It's been over a year since it's last appearance right? Omg I'm just so happy:D
---
what
---
Oh my god...
---
All good man :)
---
Gottem
---
Wait...BBQ?!
---
Thank you. It is supposedly a minority now that hated him but come on. I only played legion a handful of times and anytime I play against their are dcs. People wanted him nerfed now that it's happening people are crying like really?
---
Can you read? Or are you a snarky dev?
---
I refrained from buying LF in hopes that it would come up on shrine lolol.  Didn't think it actually would though.
---
But the duration is shorter, and you will likely just lose them trying to get to them.
---
Because the killer usually goes to the further away gens first so it‚Äôs usually pointless lol
---
I really don‚Äôt get why, Legion is an annoying killer that‚Äôs true, but making him unplayable for people who payed for him is just unfair. Plus he is even more boring now that he is a m1 killer.
---
I just wanted the terror radius normal and for the deep wound timer not to tick down in it. Just to stop the moonwalking bs. Also maybe make it so missing a attack drained the duration faster. Everything else was alright. Besides the other noted exploits. Still unsure if the removing blood stains was to much.
---
‚ÄúKiller is unfun to play against!‚Äù
---
‚ÄúWe hear you. We‚Äôll make it so nobody ever plays them.‚Äù
---
Nah just a great teamate.  Killers bring flashlight saves on themselves.  They are so easy to counterplay with just a little bit of in game awareness.
---
Well, ya, but he could also not and have others see his content over the ages.
---
What is a pip? Is that like the nodes in the bloodweb? (Sorry I'm new to the game)
---
"These Survivors have lost their frustration. They have forgotten what anger and salt mean. It's time for them to remember... " (RE3 mercenaries opening parody)
---
And also, nerf Unrelenting.
---
&gt;complains about mid-tier killer 
---
&gt;gets laughed at
---
&gt;surprisedpikachu.jpg
---
Yes
---
I get a dopamine rush from ragequits as doc. I run cancerous builds and 3-gen right out the gate. 
---
You mean pros, not cons.
---
i hope so
---
This is my favorite
---
Hey I'm new here, why is Doctor considered the DC king?
---
Oink
---
I agree he needed something changed, but now he's a killer using a butter knife for a weapon... He's in the most literal sense unusable. Absolutely worthless... It's incredibly sad to see, really.
---
Legion players did this to themselves with all the exploiting of the chase mechanic to force unavoidable downs.  The devs obviously didn't intend for that to be the strat when they released him.  That being said you won't see every single one of the changes make it through ptb.  They'll end up scrapping a few of the nerfs I'm sure.
---
Considering how badly they treated Legion in this upcoming update, are you certain you should be excited for a Freddy rework?
---
He is. He posted in the main legion thread. Hes a verified dev and even cleared up one of the new legion achievements. 
---
Unless the blue title is fake. But it says hes real in the sub reddit.
---
Personally I would not have gone with the terror radius thing, but I do agree with you otherwise.
---
That's a nerf not a rework, lmao.
---
So glad I didn't buy this DLC.
---
Fixing the legion was so easy, they just had to remove the deep-wound bullshit and make it so  that normal hits deal 1, the feral frenzy attack deals 0=5 (healty being 2, injured 1 and downed 0) so of you are healty you go to 1.5 that is "injured" with half of the healing bar already full, but if he hits you again (with his power) you go to 1(actually injured) and he gets stunned and now he can either try to hit you normally or use his power getting stunned 2 more times in the process(hit, stun, hit, you down, he stunned). Boom, buff the power here and there with cd reduction and stuff and easy you now have a killler that doesn't require you to heal for 30+ seconds everytime and now, it is actually useful to heal.
---
SB is just trash tier perk so I dont blame
---
I just came to say - to all the 12 year old legion mains that knew everyone hates them but didn‚Äôt care because they wanted dbd easy mode, - you‚Äôre welcome :)
---
Achievements, trophies, whatever you call them have and always will be meaningless regardless of game or developer.
---
dead by detective
---
For real though... were all those nerfs really necessary?
---
Well maybe all except Sprint Burst for obvious reasons lol.  That one doesn't play nice with others.  It's a lone wolf, a real Renee-Gade.
---
It'll show it to whoever brought it in but if it's marked secret it won't flip for anyone else.
---
Do perks like Distressing and Thrill of the Hunt merely help you to reach the 8k cap?
---
If I tend to reach the cap without them, is there any point using them when trying to farm bloodpoints?
---
*screams*
---
Dead Hard is my go to.  It's just so useful in so many situations once you learn how to use it properly.  When it works that is lol.  Damn that dreaded exhausted bug.
---
I guess you havent seen the Legion changes yet.
---
oh gosh oh frick
---
Pips and popping are tokens for ranking in DBD.
---
Probably got lucky to face a non - mechanic abusing one. Personally, the moment I see one that abuses the Deep Wound timer by looking on the ground while "chasing" or even the infinite mending one I just kill myself on first hook.
---
They said that the duration is increased, but movement speed is decreased.
---
I have notice this more recently. many gaming content creators have getting depression and having a huge toll on their life's. I hope it wasn't in his case. but hope for a bright future for him
---
Maybe even 50
---
Don't forget the mori.
---
Does it work for DLCs too? I thought that DLC were a special case, since they don't track the time you have the DLC active and thus DLCs aren't part of the refundable items.
---
People have said that every week since LF's release
---
So got a bit confused with what you were saying so ignore any comments I made earlier. I did my own investigation and for anyone curious this is the full story:  
---
Yes this guy did actually meet a Dev. He goes by the name of almo2001 and plays mainly pig and wraith. He's a designer for DbD and is not all that great as killer but is much better as a survivor. His name is Ethan Larson and got his start making a game called Linkage. Afterwords he worked at Ubisoft Montreal for a time before becoming a Dead by Daylight Developer. He's a relatively new hire and has been working on the game since late 2017. He designed the Legion changes and is generally a kind person.  
---
The clip in question is a stream he uploaded the same date as this comment where the exit gates were powered and he had someone hooked right next to the exits. A few people were swarming the hook and farming their teammate which prompted him to say "If you guys wanna be bitches, bring it."  
---
He plays a little campy but less of maliciously doing so on purpose and more of the ecleptic and paranoid "new to killer" kind of camping. It's still not good but it's not the same as purposefully facecamping.  
---
I did not find a source for Ethan calling Rasen a bitch but since the rest of Rasen's story seems to check out I believe that this happened though probably not in a derogatory context.  
---
Does he camp? Yes.  
---
Does he tunnel? Yes.  
---
Is he a scummy killer? No, he's just inexperienced.  
---
He's someone who mainly plays Survivor (or at least knows that role the best) and knows things from that perspective. I think you can tell as much from the Legion changes. That being said there are people who perfer Killer and know that side or know both sides like Not\_Queen, and hopefully they can balance that out during the course of the PTB.  
---
Ethan Larson seems to be overall a chill person and hopefully in time he will become a bit more experienced as killer and better represent a role model for the community. A reminder that if you have issues with the Legion changes please direct them to subreddit discussions and the DBD Forums. DO NOT go after Ethan as he is just doing what he thinks is the best for the game, and is not the proper place to vent your frustration or discuss upcoming changes.
---
&gt;  I've gotta admit tho i've never played against a moonwalking one, or someone who exploited his add ons. 
---
then you never have seen why everyone hates him
---
They'll review the request
---
Strawman Fallacy.
---
Ya, happened to me last night against a Michael and pig, they were running around working together so I disconnected immediately to avoid giving them a single point and was hoping the other survivors would too but they didnt. I figure I'll spectate then to see since they didn't leave and they were just taking turns downing the people, picking them up and as soon as they'd wiggle off the opposite killer would smack them. 
---
Eventually they did disconnect but after a minute of taking a beating, it even showed us survivors that the other person (the survivor who was in on it) had brought in a mori so I knew going in it was probably that happening. 
---
Glad they're going after the people who were doing it purposely to ruin the experience like that, although I do have some sympathy toward people who tried it harmlessly just to see it and are now worried they may be banned. Glad I never really cared to try it.
---
Without video of him doing it it's not bannable.  The request alone isn't enough.  Obviously video wasn't possible since you were the killer in question and you had enough integrity to deny that little shit the cheat request, kudos to you by the way.  But yeah totally bannable if you're ever a survivor in a game and catch this going on blatantly.  Record the game if it happens and report it.
---
I don't know anything about the guy, but his comments sound extremely survivor biased.
---
Got confused due to some of the links. Check my other post.
---
Not even considering the patch isn't out yet.
---
And we still know nothing about the addons - specifics about his power
---
how else would you stop people from moonwalk exploiting?
---
What the fuck. DUDE. Who's going to even play him anymore?? I used to but after this obviously I can't. This isn't a killer anymore. This is an edgy fifth survivor.
---
[oink](https://youtu.be/HYmBFuMtW1Q?t=2)
---
Ah ok thanks for the clarification
---
\&gt;wanting bamboozle
---
*Oink*
---
Saw this coming a mile away.
---
I'm so happy about this, this is definitely going too far especially with feral frenzy multiple hits not doing anything and deep wound timer not going down in their increased terror radius. But now I can actually enjoy a legion game!
---
I gave In and bought bubba for bbq because I didn‚Äôt think it‚Äôd ever show up. 
---
....a week later it shows up. DAMN.
---
I got some news for you, friend. This is a Freddy tier nerf disguised as a rework.
---
Not real, how do I wake up my dream entities?  
---
Seriously though how long has it been o.o
---
The funny thing is that Doc is pretty dogshit with MoM existing now.
---
Not random
---
There won't be any Legion games after this lmao
---
Which can take over an hour &gt;.&lt;
---
Honestly Stake Out is one of those perks that‚Äôs really slept on
---
Your rework idea was actually a rework. This is just a blanket nerf with a "but muh 115%" bone thrown in.
---
Point ^
---
Same, but finally just came back for another Rank 1/1 grind
---
The only better pure Connors is
---
Can we get one for favorite, now useless group of edgy teenagers known at the legion?
---
Except feral frenzy can't reduce deep wounds, you can't track while in frenzy, and your frenzy immediately ends when you miss. They're less like a gang of hyped up killers and more like  a bunch of geriatric fucks without their oxygen.
---
It does. I believe it's more or less tracking down the playtime you have after the purchase. I know from experience because i refunded the hag dlc after an hour with it.
---
You can‚Äôt get 2000 shards in an hour
---
BBQ on Doctor is the best. Whack some point gain offerings on there and you've got 100k+/game.
---
No longer it'll be F for Freddy, but F for Frank.
---
I feel really bad for the people who just bought leatherface or do not have enough shards to BBQ&amp;Chili .
---
I bit the bullet about 1 1/2 years ago and bought the leatherface DLC when it first came and it has helped me so much.
---
However don't listen to some of these people here. While LF is a best a mid tier killer but his perks? Easily among the top 30 if not outright 20. Knock Out &amp; Franklin's Demise are amazing perks in their own right. Franklins is particularly powerful against SWF(Flashlights,Keys, and insta-heal medkits) and 4 survivors loaded with tool boxes. Knock out is more niche and best combined with deerstalker but it has it's uses.
---
I would recommend getting the leatherface DLC.
---
Oh I agree entirely, someone impersonating him would be way more serious than his playstyle. Thank you for saying this, it is a good message. 
---
I admit the bitch comment wasn‚Äôt that bad. After he took feng down the second time I swarmed him and did the bodyblock where killer can‚Äôt kick the pallet. I wanted him to down me and not her, trying to be a stupid hero. After he downed me, he just said something like ‚ÄúI know that trick, bitch‚Äù I am perfectly fine with the fact that he got the best of me, I made a lot of mistakes. 
---
After he beat us, he did seem friendly in the chat. And seems mostly chill watching more of his matches. If I hadn‚Äôt of looked him up, I would have had no idea about the comment. Thanks for verifying everything however you did, and honestly it is kinda cool to get to play a dev. If this caused any issues, I can delete my posts. Sorry if it did.
---
Except I keep getting rekt by these trash tier killers :(
---
Would gold if I could
---
I don't want them to
---
Maybe I'm a bit biased, but I'd always reccomend PC over console. KB+Mouse is just so nice, the ability to replace hardware over time and no fees to play online is just the cherry on top. If your hardware is good enough you'll also consistently see better performance and graphics than consoles too. 
---
However in terms of DBD, console will probably get all the same attention PC does, this game is not optimised very well, but it's been getting better and is going to continue to improve, so I don't think I could reccomend switching JUST for DBD. However, I'd reccomend switching in general.
---
Photoshopped
---
Legion died for this
---
Yup. All I want is people trying. But when I see someone just hiding or even just urban evading around the map you can bet I‚Äôll sabotage their "win".
---
No it does not
---
I've brought it up a few times in the past.
---
Doc is EXTREMELY good at being *very* annoying and counters survivor's tactics. If you use perks like Huntress Lullaby, Unnerving, Overcharge and distressing you can have a massive terror radius and make skill-checks a pain in the ass to hit.
---
Also, he flat out is "Anti-Fun" for survivors. Madness 3 disables 
---
most interactions + item uses. This means if doc zaps you to madness 3, no flashlights, healing, or repairs. So you gotta run the fuck away to snap out of it, but the skill checks are harder to hit because of unnerving presence (Unless they changed it when they made snapping out of it "No longer a healing action"). Meanwhile the generator is ticking down because most docs kick gens alot.
---
You snap out of it (finally) and go back to the gen, go to repair it and SURPRISE overcharge activates and you have a very hard to hit skillcheck combined with unnerving making it harder to hit and madness placing it randomly on the screen. (And maybe no warning from huntress lullaby) So you fuck up, doc is alerted, and he rushes back to zap you into madness 3 again, etc. 
---
You eliminate stealth by existing, and well-timed shocks can deny vaults, pallet drops, etc. 
---
While Legion is annoying because of no counterplay, doc is extremely frustrating to play against IMHO because he flat out says "Fuck your shit".
---
With addons you can get exhaustion in madness 3, which means you disable stuff like Dead Hard, Lithe, Balanced Landing, etc. 
---
If you 3-gen (patrol 3 gens close together) as doc there's pretty much nothing the survivors can do. Every bit of progress they make, you reverse. 
---
If you use a Jigsaw Piece to play on The Game as doc you're in for a treat as the terror radius and insanity aura goes through the floor, meaning you can be running around chasing a survivor in treatment mode on the bottom floor, and survivors on the top floor will go insane too. 
---
[4-man DC's](https://youtu.be/KAxY4ZN3QOE) are not uncommon.
---
Whats the rework exactly??
---
Yeah those guys are getting banned...
---
To the default spirit on ps4,
---
Thank you for bm‚Äôing and mori‚Äôing me after I did 2 entire gens by myself when each of my teammates DC‚Äôd as soon as they were caught, which was under 5 minutes into the game. I didn‚Äôt even loop or do anything remotely disrespectful and actually stayed in the game unlike everyone else while also using a meme build and you still find it warranting of that, the cherry on top was the juicy depip I got too. Thanks.
---
You have all the counterplay you could ask for now, since nobody is going to touch these edgy losers ever again. Maybe now we can work on making Billy's chainsaw sprint repair broken pallets.
---
Really not trash, you get Haste on command, gives an early boost at the start of a chase which is just really good. Sure I prefer Balanced or Lithe, but Sprint is still one of the top tiers.
---
Why. First with freddy, now Legion? Can we drop the nerf hammer and just rework the killer instead?
---
I kinda think they had to make a big change. Think about it. If a large portion of people are disconnecting because they hate playing against legion (even if you call them babies, or completely are against DCing) BHVR has to do something about people leaving the game. Look at this subreddit for example. There are at least a dozen memes every day about "legion bad" and jokes about DC 
---
because legion.
---
Lmaoooo ripp
---
The disrespect for Saw
---
I don‚Äôt know about that. 
---
If this Legion ‚Äòrework‚Äô is anything to go by, it‚Äôs hard to believe they‚Äôre going to do Freddy justice.
---
oh fuck you're my hero lmfao
---
*please shroud of separation* please shroud of separation **please shroud of speration**
---
Just play Nurse. The survivor hate train hasn't hit us yet. Yet.
---
Jeez, the one killer that was kind of fun to play and they nerfed their ass hard.
---
Im on vacation once..
---
Miss me with that weak shit. Survivors with BT unhook directly in front of you to proc it.
---
LF as in getting lucky with how you find them( For LF in the open for Legion multiple together.) and Pig as in slowing down(Traps and mending).
---
Fuck legion and fuck all the troglodytes that play him. No counterplay is bullshit
---
A really good/coordinated swf is almost impossible to win against. That being said, most swf groups aren't really good. Either they're not that coordinated, or they're not even that worried about just doing gens and getting out. There are definitely things to do as killer to beat groups.
---
Happens when you trigger the hags trap too
---
I think he is talking about the fact that bubba is slower than survs while winding it up√•
---
Nah you didn't lie or act in any way badly, no need to delete anything.
---
Just thought I'd put the addendum at the end because you never know who is reading and what's on their mind.
---
I'm actually glad you brought this issue up, it's important to have dev transparency and if this ended up being a big issue than it was good that we know. Investigations never hurt anybody and it ultimately helps us understand the dev's though process better and hopefully have better input on the game going forward.
---
and keep putting up videos! I'll be watching  = )
---
Yeah, because Legion was so awful to go against. Nerfing the mending and his power IS a fix. I do agree that it sucks that people spent money and a lot of bp into Legion and that now he's so weak, but I'd rather have a weak killer than a broken one.
---
When was it by BHVR?
---
They dont have any counterplay. Thats complete bullshit. They can vault anything survivors can at their speed. Breaking line of sight isnt gonna do shit against a killer whos not new or complete trash. If all else fails, just fuckin moonwalk em, right? Survivors should just counter that too huh?
---
I have been playing for like 3 years and this is like the second time I have seen this perk in the web.. first time I didn't have enough shards and wasn't playing as much that was like 2 years ago..
---
I played Legion for pure farm games since they beat out my farming Doctor. At least they'll still be good for that.
---
Too cute. Happy cake day!
---
The killer just hit someone not too close a few seconds before the unhook happened, this is definitely not farming, just the killer being a baby and feeling the need to use very rare add-ons, mori AND abandoning a chase with the sole intention to tunnel.
---
Also, it was a Meg.
---
The most incompetent set of developers I have ever had the misfortune of being exposed to.
---
Good job.
---
I'm gonna try this. Sounds potentially boring but worth it... for art.
---
When you miss and attack in Feral frenzy it cancels it. BS!!!
---
Survivors no longer take off any mend time when legion attacks with Feral frenzy. BYE FRANKS MIXTAPE
---
You must wait until the power gauge is full to use the power again. Sure. Okay.
---
Wether in chase or not, the mend timer stops in the killers terror radius. Okay...
---
Mending will now pause the timer. Best thing. 
---
This legion rework went WAY TOO FRIGGIN FAR
---
Read my flair.
---
Not even a fuckin legion main.
---
"false advertisment", what is exactly "falsely" advertised here, kevin?
---
Keep pushing this narrative. Most people who main killer had no issue with DS. The only people who did we're the salty dickheads on the forums, this subreddit, and TydeTyme.
---
Posts like this are why this community will always be divided and stupid.
---
Is... is Jane a cannibal too?
---
DS counterplay was a perk (I don't count dribbling). Whenever I bring up perks as counters I get shouted down.
---
Balance in all things.
---
Did I say moonwalking should stay? No. Every change on the list is fine, excepting hitting multiple times not reducing the deep wound timer. Breaking line of sight and hiding is also the exact same counterplay that nurse has, is it easy? No, not it's not. Does it exist? Yes, yes it does. Just because survivors don't wanna adapt to not just pressing space bar on every pallet on the map and the killer having very little counterplay to that, does not mean a character should just be removed.
---
I wasted all that time playing Cannibal :( if i just waited a few more months
---
Shitter list more like.
---
Doesn't everyone at rank 1 insta dc against nurse?
---
none of that shit
---
My main problem with the doc is that survivors scream way too much against him :D annoying as fuck
---
Oh well , I guess he wasn't. 
---
Seemed to be though, my mistake.
---
Dunno how it's a "baby killer" move. If you have a Mori you want to use it to take a survivor out of the game as quickly and efficiently as possible, so why wouldn't you go for the guy who was just unhooked?
---
sneaking up on any killer is fun i had a huntress camping the hatch and i snuk up behind her and sat there for a good 5 mins before she moved
---
I like how the devs said legion "rework" but they just fucked him in the ass.I mean i have legion and hes not fun to play and now i definetly won't play him anymore.
---
Really BE?, So the solution for an annoying but bad killer is, nerf it to the ground? That's some lazy shit
---
Susie is so fucking cute
---
wow. if i wasn't married i'd ask a permission to orally moisturize your primary sexual characteristics.
---
Hello? 911? Yes, I'd like to report a murder. Their ID says "Legion"
---
Yes, I'll hold...
---
Its literally easier to break line of sight against a nurse. Legion just runs at you at sprint burst speed and vaults everything you do. Theyre intended playstyle was to keep everyone injured and mending, not to tunnel one person for the whole match. Everyone seems to forget the buffs to their movement speed and the fact that feral frenzy is gonna last even longer. I seriously dont think theyre gonna be worse than they are now.
---
Hm when I thought about it atleast this will counter the basement block by a killer until the BT runs out. Happened to me few days ago by a freaking nurse .... Now this will never run out right ? /unless she brings Insidious lol - thatd be suuper smart and funny at the same time/
---
The funny thing is they didn't nerf DS, they just changed its function, made a new DS (MoM) and designed it to not have any counterplay.

That's not a rework that's and execution.
---
Which survivor perk is better?
---
Thanks mate I had no idea
---
I disagree.  Outside of maybe red ranks I think SWFs makes the game balanced. And its in the killers favor when its solo survivors.
---
Legion, you're drunk, go home.
---
FUCK YES
---
Spirit nerfs: read as "audio bugs every single fucking patch"
---
Nothing else tho
---
So no more need to level clown or LF.
---
Nice
---
What happens when a shroud of binding is used in the same game as a shroud of separation?
---
Self Care worthless trash tbh
---
Legion change goes through PTB full chapter after his release. Freddy got nerfed a week after his release.
---
pretty sure that shows they learned something.
---
Its a known exploit. People are doing this on purpose. Bhvr has said they are actively tracking them and banning them. Its not just a random occurrence
---
That's the point I'm making here lmao
---
Letherface is a lot of fun.
---
I'm glad Clown is more common on PC, I've only played against the fat bastard 4 or 5 times in my whole DbD career on PS4, and I got the game when it was free on Ps Plus
---
Okay, wait until PBE. Don't get your hopes down! They WILL learn from this. We gave them so much shit for their lack of thinking that there is no possible way all of these changes make it though. Honestly looking at it the changes listen they look like several different individual possible changes. If they do let all these changes go through they are going to meet a LOT of harsh criticism based on their stupidity for allowing all changes to go through.
---
Papa bless
---
Thank you devs. You could have balanced him out properly but its pretty clear NO1 in the dev team know how to BALANCE things.
---
Every survivor is playable.
---
Some killers are unplayable because they dont want a killer to be op.
---
We could have reworked the killer as a whole, BUT THATS TOO MUCH EFFORT so lets just nerf him, let him sit there for a few years AND THEN WE CAN BE LIKE "OH YEAH, WE NERFED THIS KILLER. BETTER BRING HIM BACK NOW LOL" Wtf are the devs thinking half the time. Its pathetic of how many poor choices they have made so far.
---
Hi live-balance designer maybe you should rework killers instead of running them into the ground like you did with Freddy and now with Legion since we PAY for it with our hard earned money... But I guess you will soon enough promice another "rework" that will come like winter in RR Martin's books....
---
Lithe, quick and quiet and dance with me.
---
Wow.
---
Yep, its def okay to have both of those injuries to the deep wound at the same time. 
---
/s
---
what's 80% of playerbase? i only see former Legion mains complaining they'll need actual strategy to efficiently play their favorite killer.
---
They are truly in a damage control mode.. they're even forcing BBQ into the shrine to appease the playerbase.
---
Wow... good fuckin' job Behaviour
---
I'm just happy that I can finally play legion in peace
---
Those checker box textures tell a different story... one of a missing texture.
---
This literally made my day. The timer... so intense xD
---
Its not even that, they just buffed the killers base, and nerfed the ability to hell.
---
It can work, but camping the pallet still completely neuters his power.
---
It will never change.  Adapt or perish.
---
... That's a bad idea
---
But in the patch notes didn‚Äôt they say the duration was going to be increased while the movement speed was going to be decreased?
---
Dev saved our (survivor main) life..
---
And now we‚Äôre free from META Toxic satanic build!!(Old Legion w/Frank‚Äôs Mixtapes)
---
You must‚Äôve never taken an arrow in the knee
---
This is why I don't buy any more content from Behaviour but only use iridescence shards to get killers...
---
They burned me once with Freddy after I've spent my own money to purchase him and now they do same shit with Legion!
---
Maybe..., just maybe REWORK killers instead of running them into the ground since people spend thier own hard earned money on them..., I pity those that purchased cosmetics to support Behaviour additionally ...
---
But even reworks are like winter in RR Martins books "they are coming" pathetic...
---
Tommy is the real killer.
---
Somebody help, I'm not allowed to play a killer with training wheels anymore!
---
Guys, stock up on lottery tickets and scratch cards because our luck might just be up a level; Irish level.
---
Adpocalypse, rise in adblock usage, algorithm changes, stale AAA gaming market, overflow of new content creators, useless YouTube support (content ID/copyright claim nonsense)...I don't blame them. Even Monto's starting to ask for likes at the beginning of his videos.
---
The golden age of YouTube is long gone. And Twitch is just boring to me now. Hard to say what the future holds for gaming-based entertainers if streaming goes the way YouTube did.
---
Stockpiling Emergency Medkits to remove Pharmacy for later games is what I do. I run Botany Knowledge, Emergency Med with Abdominal Dressing and Gel Dressing to get 3 full heals out at like what a 6 or 7 second heal. 
---
Sometimes I bring Pharmacy to just give medkits to teammates or have them heal with the medkit while I do a gen.
---
They are both pretty shit lmao. Surprised you agree about Freddy, not many redditors can even comprehend the possibility that he might not be F tier lmao
---
They added the larger terror radius to make it more in line with other 115% movement speed killers . It was mostly done out of consistency.
---
WHAT'S EVEN THE POINT OF HIS POWER NOW????
---
He may as well just do with the new changes. If he chases a survivor thats already injured it's pointless to fastvault (on a normal sized loop). If you injured and he chases you to a loop, you drop the pallet and he can either fast vault it and the stun allows you to complete the loop. Legion either has to break the pallet or mindgame you to get the hit when you vault the pallet (like every other killer that isn't an anti loop killer). For windows I think it is like normal vaulting now: Slower Frenzy (i assume it will impact the vault speed) + Frenzy end stun (which you will get if you want to down a injured survivor) will take as much time as a normal vault.
---
But the legion is already super bad, he was just annoying. Even just one of those nerfs is enough to kill him. All of them? He will never be playable ever again.
---
OMFG BBQ I WAITED 3 MONTHS
---
Okay its making me angry because it means they held it back on purpose.
---
Oh no, Freddy is straight garbage I‚Äôm concept. But people don‚Äôt take into account the slowing potential or let alone perks. I might not be good at him and he may be high skill cap but he isn‚Äôt F tier.
---
yeah if you're bringing in a green med kit than pharmacy is probably better, is susceptible to franklins though
---
In concept? Dont you like his power?
---
Legions entire idea was moronic and stale. They are going to break his legs and give him a rework later on just like they are doing with Freddy. No amount of number tweaks will make Legion fun to play and not anti fun.
---
Scalped? In my lobby? It‚Äôs more likely than you think.
---
That's so fucking sad :'(
---
yes and I was adding to your point: The perk sucks dick  and pharmacy is probably about as good as it because it requires you to go out of your way to loot, whilst SC takes way too long to worth using.
---
I just got the game like a month ago and he was my first purchase :(
---
well you can feel his regret lol
---
Why would you buy a DLC a day before shrine reset...
---
Solution: don't use totems. I mean who needs hex:ruin am I right? *nervous sweating *
---
I like it. I think the sleep transition was supposed to be a counter thing due to the slowing potential. But anyone would look at 7 seconds of being unable to attack as a bad killer. But he really isn‚Äôt as bad as everyone says.
---
Secret offerings don‚Äôt flip over for other players.
---
In a chase, Lithe is miles better. Paired with Q&amp;Q (as well as DWM), you can pull off some mighty jukes.  
---
That being said, outside a chase, it's not a perk you want to activate without Q&amp;Q, since fast vaulting usually makes noise and notifies the killer.

This part of the movie was so nice stylistically, this last shot of Franco about to die was beautiful. Plus that shit his duster did when he jumped behind the glass while attempting to rob the bank was dope as hell. Off topic but eh.
---
You are ommiting so many possibilities here. She could have just stopped and taken a hit then the M1 CD would just have been perfect for her to open the door.
---
The problem was never that he was broken, he was just insanely boring to play against.
---
Agreed. Definitely needs some reworking. Really frustrating when you‚Äôve done so much work killing the other three to have the last guy easily escape.
---
That's going to be me soon! Just need to get ps+ again!
---
No
---
One useless killer more. 
---
Let's nerf billy and nurse like that. 
---
Let's make all killers like new legion so survivor mains can have endless fun as killers won't harm them anymore. I think its fare, as killing people is bad. *Sarcasm*
---
I would like a killer that doesn‚Äôt get looped to oblivion. Legion did just that.
---
what? god i feel like an idiot. think i need to read these offerings more haha
---
Actually we don't know yet how they'll handle it. Remember howany times Wraith was changed?
---
Same. I bought him 3 days ago because the internet assured me that BBQ had only been on the Shrine once and never would be again.
---
instant facecamp
---
Yes. Because some people are assholes they should nerf a killer to oblivion.
---
 ü¶Äü¶Ä POLL RESULTS STILL AREN'T HIDDEN  ü¶Äü¶Ä
---
Unpopular opinion but freddy can be very very opresive in the right hands. A good freddy player knows the timeings for the dream transition and is capable of downing a survivor with this alone. The best way to play freddy is to mindgame a survivor, pull other survivors into dream world (kick a gen or break a pallet as well if you want to) and when you think the surv is about to wake head back to them and then mindgame them for a down. If a dream mindgame fails be aware if there is a mindgameable loop nearby, you may be able to get the surv there instead. Always watch asleep survivors, if they are somewhere unsafe go for them. Most of freddy is mindgameing, game knowledge and knowing when to strike; the rest is sleeping.
---
Here is a guide that should help a lot:

https://youtu.be/0rTtr7pUe-Q
---
And here is a refrence for dream trans times:
---
https://youtu.be/TQd087TtKMo
---
Freddy is the hardmode of killer, he isnt weak but a single mistake can be detrimental and he is the most difficult killer to master in the game. I highly recomend only getting him after gaining a large amount of experience with the game and getting most perks, perks help freddy a lot.
---
On the bright side if you do, do well as freddy it is extreamly satisfying when you get a victory against good survivors. Not only that but you probebly mentally damaged them with the knowledge they got fisted by what is commonly believed to be the weakest killer in the game.
---
so nerf a character to oblivion just because people are whining about an add on? lmfao
---
Nobody knows it. Actually he could wind up with having a motorcycle instead
---
No it isn‚Äôt and no they didn‚Äôt wtf
---
The update is a nerf to whoever liked to abuse everything wrong with Legion imo. You can't walk backwards and let people simply bleed out while being helpless. You are encouraged to tap them with your ability (multiple survivors) to give the other something to do (mend) while you commit to downing one of them (hence the 115% speed now).  
---
It will be a different dynamic, a weaker one for sure with the exploits gone but no killer should be built on exploits.
---
Yeah I didn‚Äôt even notice the tutorial until 200+ hours.
---
Keep putting people to sleep and regressing gens. He's not a quick match killer, gotta draw out the match. He's a BP making machine.
---
As usual there‚Äôs a killer that can kill survivors and beat them at their own game. Enough whining and now that killer is pretty much shit. Survivors continue to have all the fun.
---
"yo, you got games on ya phone?"
---
As others said, Boil Over is shit. Useless shit.
---
I got most teachables but I actively avoid some of them by not leveling that survivor further because some perks sucks and I don't want them to clog up my bloodweb. Boil Over is one of them besides Streetwise and some others.
---
I feel like they probably will, he‚Äôll probably still appeal to a large amount of people.
---
Couldn't have said it better myself tbh
---
Yeah this is what it does. Did it recently while waiting for friends.
---
WHAT!? This whole time I thought it helped me get off the killers shoulder quicker.
---
I bought him for bbq yesterday.....fuck
---
I literally said ‚Äúthe changes are bad‚Äù
---
I did that once, many months ago.  2 near instant dcs.  1 slightly later DC.  1 got to farm.  Great Freddy advertising.
---
*Distortion use skyrockets*

i love this ^

Yup. 100~ mories and more than 500 purple addons. 
---
I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE TO DIE
---
ü¶Ä OP'S MONEY, ALSO GONE ü¶Ä
---
well, this sounds familiar.
---
cant wait to actually try him and see if its actually bad.
---
judging this early is why things turn to shit AFTER players get to try them.
---
Oh for fucks sake, stop crying. The Legion update is good for everyone, you have to actually use your brain with Feral Frenzy and you can chase like any standard MS killer. Now you cant spam FF making the game unplayable for survivors.
---
&gt; I expected a rework... not a slaughter
---
they used his own power on him. multiple stabs for really deep wounds.
---
Not really. He can still play him if he wants.
---
Are the rework changes released?
---
War never changes.
---
yeah... rank reset proving this right too many times
---
ye, but he is implying like he'll never do it
---
Feral Frenzy is supposed to let you locate survivors, make them waste time and can help you in chases by ignoring vaults. Sorry you now can't spam and tunnel making the game unplayable for survivors.
---
still weak, but weak like doctor or trapper, not weak like freddy or bubba. im gauging this assumption with zero addons
---
Ofcourse when i buy LF...
---
Lower rank killers after rank reset. Don't know how to apply map/gen pressure so they play the only way they know how to get a kill or 2 :(
---
Actually he sounds interesting to play now, Frenzy requires skill as attack misses are punished. I'm curious to try him now
---
I agree. I think the reaction here towards the changes is way overblown. He will be pretty good at wasting time and sloppy butcher will be even better now that people actually have a reason to heal up against since he is a 115% speed killer now.
---
Also it is not like Legion was OP before these changes. He was just super annoying. After the changes I think he will be way less annoying but still decent. The first hit on (perhaps multiple) survivors will still be free which is strong by  itself.
---
I might be wrong but I doubt he will be useless. We will have to wait for the PTB to see though.
---
Community: you nerfed legion too much
---
Devs: b-but they've got b-base movement speed
---
I just spent like a week grinding just to unlock bbq, great...
---
If I shit on a plate and serve that to you and you wince and puke and refuse to eat my shit I could say the same god damn thing: "You didn't even try it! How do you know it tastes like shit if you don't try it?"
---
I bet you thought you'd never even change it in the first place
---
ronald mcdonald is my fursona
---
Susie main here, big sad.
---
I know it's annoying to play against but they weren't that strong. No idea if I'll still want to play Susie at all now.
---
Survivors are the entities real minions and the entity is torturing the millers for what they did in life. Like hell. And the deeper into hell you go the worse it gets. Ugh lol mettle of man is stressful when paired with the other meta perks and good high rank survivors
---
Everyone needs to calm their tits - legion was more broken than any other killer
---
Yes I am aware I've commented on a few here.
---
Those who think they're doing something nice might not be aware its not always perceived that way, so whats wrong with presenting a different view? Also I don't consider 5 comments to be major spam or too forceful, I don't think my language has been particularly bad (maybe 1, was meant to be funny). 
---
Anyways, this is the comment section of a meme that is literally telling the survivors to leave. Other users here might be saying "i'm only staying for x reason", I think Op (or the sentiment behind the meme) is aware of those reasons and wants them to leave anyway. Some share your view, others share mine. Whats wrong with commenting that?
---
Oh yes Haha gotta get that perk out of the way, just like DS
---
Is this Sims? Looks like Sims.
---
way to go, fam
---
Every once in awhile yes when trying to play with someone. Sometimes having the other person add helps. Sometimes I get it if the killer leaves before game starts. Generally just restart the game. But I'm not sure if there are any real solutions at the moment. Someone else may know.
---
what about missing a hit getting a stun?
---
don't you see you could be using this like the Wraith's add-on that uncloaks when you break/hit?
---
I've never had it as killer tho.
---
Lol or when you almost finish a gen with someone and the person being chased sandbags you cause they would rather you die then them get hooked once
---
You fucking suck at your job. The character didn't need to be nerfed. All you idiots had to do was fix the mending bug THAT YOU LEFT IN THE GAME FOR WEEKS ON END. But you didn't do that and you decided to listen to rank 20 survivors yet again. 
---
Looking forward to a Legion rework 2 years later when the game is really dead and the killer base have abandoned this. I legit want a refund for the money I paid for Legion and the cosmetics.

Thing is, people expected a well thought change to fix this huge issue with exploits and stuff... not a big pile of handicaps and changes of values. I'm not saying that adding something to stop moonwalking would be easy to implement, but surely going "Alright fuck everything, let's make him a m1 killer" is not such a smart idea. I'm not a game developer so therefore I really don't know exactly much effort they actually spent on this change, but from what I can see they just changed the usual values (movement speed, terror radius, ability duration, ability movement speed), removed some lines of code and added some already implemented ones.
---
As a new player, I can actually never escape him. Why is he so bad?
---
I have so much fun with spirit. She starts out complicated but once you are use to her she is so good. I used the clown before her and I do millions of times better with her. Michael is not good for me personally
---
I can't imagine how terrifying it must have been for the killer to be sitting there minding your own business and have a bald, bearded Dwight's creep into your periferal vision at eye level, 3 minutes after they took this screenshot of you without you noticing
---
I got her with shards instead of money
---
Yeah well look at the intricacy of his power compared to other killers, it is no wonder he was easy to exploit. They had to do something because people just didn't enjoy playing against him. So much that they would just disconnect as if to say "look progression means nothing to me if i'm not having fun and just going to be the plaything of a legion'. He needed a complete rework - lets see how it plays out.
---
They're probably nerfing him to the ground so that they have some time to think of a way to actually rework him without the constant bitching from the players
---
Can somebody please link me the patch notes, I can't find them on the wikis
---
Of course they did, that's how you make money
---
tapp's on the case
---
we'll always find things to complain about, don't worry about that.
---
Slugging is more so ;)
---
they cancel each other out afaik and the game pretends nothing happened
---
*God,* I love Doc. Love his look, backstory, and I love how he's basically the "Fuck You" killer. As soon as MoM is counter able, I'll put Basement Bubba back to bed and take Doc out of his cage.
---
So is his TR. What's he going to do, apply deep wound and then chase you at 4.6m/s so you never bleed out?
---
I see you in every single thread I visit on here and a good 90% of the time you‚Äôre bitching about ‚Äòteh salty survivor mains reee‚Äô. Go outside or something mate, there‚Äôs more to life.
---
Why would they put meta perks? I forced myself to make bbq and chili teachable by playing dumb leatherface for a little while. Now it's just a freebie. I feel like they should check to make sure those perks are still for the grind. Am I right? Or is it better just showing up. If that's the case than I want legacy clothes pleease. Lol

You idiots keep insisting that Legion can't be counterplayed when anyone who actually USES the character can say otherwise. 
---
If you're not using at least Green Sketchbook then any loop will potentially let them get away. 
---
Survivors can still drop a pallet on Legion to take away the power and get away. 
---
Sprint Burst is a direct hard counter to Legion. Same with Balanced Landing and Lithe to a lesser extent. 
---
Certain loops are still hell even for Legion like the one in Ironworks of Misery or Torment Creek or Rancid Abbatoir. Survivors can still loop that shit dependent on: are they already injured? How far away is Legion? If I just want to M1 them then I'm probably not going to use Frenzy but that depends on how close I am and -again- if I have at least a Green Sketchbook. 
---
Once Legion focuses on one survivor all that guy has to do is just keep moving away from other survivors. Pull Legion away from gens and the others so they can stab multiple people. Congrats, you countered Legion and they're still going to get gen rushed. 
---
But nope, the idiots will still cry that he was OP and literally can't even be counterplayed. And there's going to be idiots saying: "Well, this is just in the PTB and all changes aren't final!" Bullshit. Fucking. Bullshit. The PTB exists for one and only one reason: to show off new features so they get some good press. That's it. Game crippling bugs were in past PTB's and were still shipped in the final game like the Mount Ormond bug. Do you really think these fucking morons at Behavior are actually going to listen to people who know what they're talking about instead of rank 20 survivors that bitch and moan constantly? No. They're not. They're main interest is appeasing the survivors because there's more of them then killer players and they want that money for cosmetics.
---
Oh no not susie :(
---
Also for the future just know that crouching will save you from hags traps. As well as flashlights shined on them. Lots of new players just set all of them off
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bdx86v/the_legion_update/
---
How can i see my ping in the game?
---
I think it originates from Dwight being the default selected survivor when you first start playing(I don't know if he is anymore) and new players used to always hide in lockers
---
Bought the dlc last week and grinded 35 in a few days. Tbh by the end of it I actually enjoyed playing him
---
They did it. The crazy bastards ACTUALLY DID IT!
---
I love it. Can't wait to [dust off Distressing, Overcharge, Unnerving, and Lullaby.] (https://youtu.be/BCGAhyH1HGQ?t=57) They won't know what hit them.
---
Huntress is a free dlc that you need to buy for free on ps4.
---
You're nurse, you can literally down the guy unhooking before the other guy gets any distance and down them too.
---
The true darkness among us was the friends we made along the way.
---
Yes intentions matter a lot as it affects his power budged. Bonus distance with swings wasn't intended so the devs weren't intending him to have this bonus mobility.
---
So it makes no sense for them to give him more mobility once they remove the bonus distance with swings. Because he wasn't meant to have it.
---
Don't, they really don't do too much. Not even unique voice lines. Joey pretty bangin' tho.
---
You don't need to play him to level him up...
---
True, but this guy was right about it
---
This reminds me of riot's balancing team. Rip Rakan
---
Is susie 16? Yikes
---
No, that'd have literally zero counterplay.
---
You run up to the survivor with your power, get a hit with your power, then close the distance while still in your power since you are faster and go over windows and pallets, cancel the power and get a normal hit before the stun to down them.
---
There is nothing the survivor could do to counteract that.
---
EXCUSE ME-
---
Me fucking too...
---
When legion gets reworked before freddy
---
I feel so called out right now. At least I bought the Ash dlc.
---
the community wont forget your sacrifice
---
fucking one guy. From all the comments and whining ive seen ONE guys gets it
---
I think we should demand refunds.
---
You cant be downed in feral frenzy anymore so the speed is fine.
---
Honestly I feel like community just likes to whine
---
god-speed
---
That's exactly why he was badly designed. If the Legion wanted you down, you would eventually be downed. His power allowed you to keep chasing and eventually down people with no skill. The survivor could delay how long it would take, but not change the fact that Legion would down you sooner or later.
---
A rational person would think so, but even the devs confirmed it stacks with other perks. I think what that sentence means is really ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll Make It will not stack on itself‚Äù like you can be buffed with Leader, Botany, Dying Light, Spine Chill, And No One Left Behind and heal Very Very fast, but if you perform two unhooks in 90 seconds, it‚Äôll only reset the duration and not layer its own buff.
---
Big yikes indeed.
---
Nah
---
I know but I payed for him. I wanted my money's worth lol.
---
People been drawing some "stuff" with her in it. Granted pictured dont have ages because if they did RIP renaissance art
---
No, it's only for We'll Make It. It's a way of them saying that if you save 2 people in the duration, you won't get 200% healing speed.
---
Why would anyone wanna leave a match like this, it looks awesome, coop killers sounds amazing.
---
Holy sht!!!!
---
Also I dont like using addons from other killers unless I can spend bloodpoints from their wins on them also. Probably not the smartest way but I like certain addons and not kick of them most of the time
---
Is this actually real ?
---
It was very much depressing
---
Not in the slightest, otherwise Yasuo would be deleted into oblivion long ago.
---
Probs a ploy to get more people to donate to the Patreon. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I hope people do. I really liked his content. But your comment is totally correct.
---
exaclly but hes at 115% now what makes him a valuble m1 killer. All thats needed is spirit fury / bamboozel and maybe brutal. There you go. Plus Deep wound can still be used to buy time. At this point you defentlky want to heal yourself against a Legion
---
Most of the update is understandable, but then It says: feral frenzy will not reduce the dw timer. That literally makes his power useless, it's like saying once you put deep wound on somebody you can't hit him again on feral frenzy (cause it wouldn't do shit anyway), so if u want to down somebody you'll just have to chase him for an m1, and the deep wound will not have a meaning anymore, cause it will not affect survs unless they're out of the TR, and the timer will anyway stop if legion is near. Then it says that u can't see pools of blood in FF, so bloodhound is useless, he can't even understand where a injured surv is anymore if the line of sight is broke while in feral frenzy, and on cornfield maps it will be a straight up mission impossible. This isn't just a "rework" to make him balanced, they butchered him.
---
How do survivors get so salty over an M1 killer
---
considering how much they nerfed Legion, i'm sure that these changes are not final and will probably be changed around in the PTB
---
Nice!
---
I suppose people only do it because of no confirmed ages. 
---
Which is what i would say if it was a survivor as no ages were confirmed but clearly the legion has a confirmed or range of ages due to the game specifically saying they are teens...
---
He needed changing, but from what I‚Äôve read he seems useless now.
---
Everything except sprint burst, I run everywhere so I never get to use it.
---
I own all the killers and still get these damn things in my bloodwebs
---
So I was thinking of buying Legion but to be honest he now sounds like shit. They nerfed him into the ground. Good thing I read the update notes.
---
they once said they want to rework moris too  
---
bloodlust has to stay in the game tho  
---
I don't like what they did to other survivor's ultra rare addons too,   
---
we can only hope they change it into i dunno the purple one giving half of a healing bar and pink one giving a full one, but remove only the addon on use or something like that  
---
let's be real  
---
"oh, someone got downed after 2 minutes of chase, let me make him 100% well again so killer has to do all that again" isn't right
---
I‚Äôm talking about the community as a whole.
---
I mean i think that Julie's or Joey's is gonna be the previously mentioned addon idea. I think Frank's will start the surv out with a reduced timer. One addon will probably make deep wounds timer go down within terror radius while not in chase, but these are just hopes...
---
It's still worth it for Franklin's demise, click at me now you fucker, I have literally hit a flashlight out of a Meg's hands into it broke, cuz she kept going back for it
---
I mean, since legion was added 27% of people on steam quit DBD. Correlation isn‚Äôt causation but BHVR seems to think legion is why.
---
So youre telling me that Legion is now a Killer that can vault pallets/windows and apply the shittiest version of borrowed time there ever was...
---
Why‚Äôd you get downvoted? Are all the legion Neil Armstrong‚Äôs here?
---
This should surprise no one. Even mathematically speaking the lack of some perks showing up is WAY too low for standard deviation. Also we have always known they have some control over perks in the shrine, because new killers and survivors don‚Äôt have their teachables in for at least 2-4 weeks after release anyway.
---
Legion just went from "Why do you hate it when others are having fun" to "why do you hatw yourself having fun?"
---
"proly doin gens"
---
Nice joke.
---
The theme is its legal in commonwealth countries
---
Legion is a Killer that can't be nerfed neither buffed because with a nerf he'll be complete ass and with a buff broken. They should've completely reworked him and gave us the Legion they showed us in their Trailer. You can't just make many skins at once and name a killer after that. We deserved a Legion that was presented to us and not given. I agree that it was ass to Face Legion but now he's just a joke. I would've been okay with the fact that it'd take time to completely rework him but when the rework happened that he'd be okay. But just simply changing some numbers and nerf him is really effortless. I hope they'll look into Legion once more after the nerf and rework him, I mean we the community could surely help them with that...
---
The theme is places that are dumb enough to think some ink on a paper deserves human rights
---
True, some would say it us a tad bit immoral though.
---
This is quality right here.
---
im gonna fking cry myself to sleep tonight knowing this happened
---
The perk is yours forever my friends, every killer you own will have it appear on their bloodwebs, I have deliverance on Jeff but don't know own Adam! :)

His videomemes are top tier. I'm downloading them and saving them in the Room for Mankind Culture Preservation.
---
How is it controversial? Everyone hates Legion
---
Agreed. Also could i see the website which you got the japan study thing off.
---
It's nice if you just want to do gens, then you can sprint off when the killer comes over.
---
This! Also on ps4 there was nothing to 'play' for the tutorial it was just a wall of text. Did they change something or is it different on pc/xbox?
---
Biiiiiig agree. For a bunch of people that complained about legion every 5.78 seconds, they sure are mad about BHVR actually changing it like they wanted. Personally, I‚Äôm excited to play against and play the new legion, maybe I won‚Äôt wanna eat glass while playing against him now.
---
If the add-ons made Legion op why didn't they just tweak those?  
---
When I've used Legion I've always struggled &amp; I haven't used those add-ons, what will it be like now?!
---
Unless the video title is "X DeSTrOYS random street SJWs with FACTS and LOGIC" or " This man saved this Komodo Dragon from drowning in the bath" or "Fail Compilation vol. 73", theres no way to do somethig in YouTube.
---
I can already feel someone out there is gonna be like ‚Äú I missed the shrine why can‚Äôt I get bbq again?‚Äù
---
Great, I can't wait to waste a perk slot on Distortion since everyone will be running BBQ now
---
Phew. Now we can finally just retire the shrine and move on :p
---
I think he will actually be able to waste more time. Before people often didnt fully heal after mending because he was so slow. Now that he moves faster he is actually a threat if you are not healed
---
How did they take you offline?
---
Dead hard is my go to, but I had some fun games running lithe, dance with me, and quick &amp; quiet.
---
Sprint burst feels like a handicap because I have to walk everywhere. I don‚Äôt trust myself to find places to activate balance landing, though if I had better map awareness it probably would be better. Adrenaline I tried to run, but it just doesn‚Äôt seem to match my playstyle to get the crazy plays others get with it.
---
Refund it if you haven't played much over two hours since.
---
I've never understood why either. It's cheap and BBQ saves you a LOT of time.
---
Did your character freeze?  I've had that happen when someone has dc'd.  I couldn't move at all for quite a while, then it started up again and I was back moving.  Has happened as Killer and Survivor.  
---
Or did your game go back to the main menu?

---
I dislike how the only place where you can see that the escape attempt has a 4% chance of success is a loading screen tip. That shit should be in the tutorial, at least.
---
I think its ridiculous for people to think he's better or worse now considering the changes aren't even out. All I know is low ranks won't be able to brainlessly get to rank 1 anymore thanks to the new ranking system and these changes.
---
Holy crap! I totally forgot RE3 had a mercenaries mode. I'm pretty sure I never actually played it.  My wife and I played RE5 mercenaries for hundreds of hours. 
---
Seriously, I would love for Capcom to put out a mercenaries game. Provide some stock characters but also let me customize character builds, weapons, etc.
---
this is so not calm...
---
I have bad news for you :(
---
I've been trying a Boil Over/Flip-Flop/Teancity/Unbreakable build and it's actually hilarious. If the killer leaves you for a split second, you're already in a corner and at least halfway recovered.
---
it's not even a final decision. there will be ptb, if it doesn't work, it doesn't work.
---
even with the changes the power is better than Dream state. you still injure and survivors waste their time mending. 
---
i'd probably be on the same page with you if they applied changes without ptb but they actually learned from Freddy experience.
---
I could still blink as normal and the only real odd moment was when I was chasing Jane, before she dced, she kept phasing in and out of reality like Spirit which was pretty funny. After that I got booted to the main menu and off psn while hunting Quentin. Normally if I get booted it isn't off psn too.
---
Yeah, but he's currently one of the ONLY killers that actually has a counter for it. Most killers just end up eating shit because they literally have no other option
---
Because they no longer can play a killer with training wheels that has no counterplay. Because they cant use the moonwalk exploit anymore.  
---
I think it is actually funny as hell, considering the community all agreed that changes were needed. 
---
I think the main complaints are coming from low rank and unskilled killers losing their crutch abilities.
---
DARKNESS DELETED.
---
You can get like 1k shards in 3-4 hours
---
I agree. Anybody that complains about not being able to down survivors with Frenzy hits literally wants to keep getting free kills. That (along with the exploitable Deep Wound mechanic) is the fundamental problem of Legion's design: hitting people in Feral Frenzy requires next to no skill or thought, has no real counterplay, and can be used to down people.
---
Legion will be solid mid tier, if not high mid tier. It's a 4.6m/s killer with what is effectively an insta-down M1. Feral Frenzy will now actually be used as it was intended, which is to find and injure survivors, regularly multiple of them, punishing them for clustering up, wasting their time mending and potentially healing, and providing you with easily-injured and already-injured survivors to chase. The value of health states cannot be overstated. It's not just an extra hit a survivor can take, being able to use that to take risks, feeling out the killer's playstyle, or being able to effectively pressure hook saves at all, but it also gives the mid-chase post-hit sprint as well as post-hit killer cooldown, which prolong chases considerably, or end them, regularly. And then there's also the cries of pain and pools of blood. Being able to derive survivors of health states as easily and swiftly as Legion can is a very valuable ability. A 4.6m/s killer that has no ability but makes all survivors suffer from the Exposed status effect all round long would certainly have to be considered high mid tier, and while Legion will not quite be that, they come close. The new Frenzy mechanics do oopen more counterplay possibilities, and thus will likely require the killer to actually think about when and how to use it, as well as control it better, but it will certainly still be an almost-guaranteed hit in most scenarios.
---
I have already been playing Cold Dirt/Joey's/Julie's Mixtape/Enduring/Spirit Fury Legion whenever I played Legion at all, only using Frenzy to injure survivors, traverse the map, and closing distances/bodyblock pallets/windows/pathways mid-chase, otherwise chasing regularly. This will be the new optimal way to play legion, and I'm more than fine with that.
---
&gt;If legion has no counterplay, nurse has no counterplay
---
Yes, Nurse doesn't really have counterplay either. Once the Nurse player gets down their muscle memory to know the range of the blinks, there isn't anything the survivor can really do as you can't juke her at that point. Hiding from her isn't really counterplay, as "just hope she never sees you" isn't healthy design. Her fatigue isn't that important as you can just us scratches/your ears and the bits of vision you have to track the survivor anyway. Plus you can run Shadowborn to counteract her limited vision and fatigue is bugged rn anyway so it doesn't actually matter atm. If you are playing on low settings you don't get the vision blurr.
---
&gt;Your vision gets screwed up, and you can't see scratch marks, so you have the opportunity to sneak out of the chase.
---
You don't lose vision of them after the first hit that applies the deep wound, so you can get another hit with no problems as they've never left your field of vision. After your next hit they start leaving scratch marks and blood and you stil have ears to determine where they've gone. It is really easy to track them.
---
&gt;But they can for 2...or 3...
---
At the start of the game when everybody is split around, yeah they can get 2 gens done and progress on the 3rd if they are playing optimally. But that's the case for non-m1 killers too. Billy, Hag, Huntress, Spirit, none of them are an exception.
---
If you are running the killer for that long after the start of the game is over then you are facing a pretty bad killer that makes a lot of bad decisions. Plus you shouldn't be devoting that much time as killer anyway, it's a waste of time. If you can't get someone fast enough, you check the gens again and fine another target that might be in an area with less defensive options.
---
&gt; chase them as a standard no tricks M1 killer(see above issues with that)
---
Check my explanation above for that. Also he's not a standard no trick killer, he's got the first hit for free. A lot of killers are like that, Pig, Hag to some extent, Wraith, Plague with her puking. He's as good at it as like half of the cast.
---
Him making people not want to heal is stronger than you're making it out to be, he's already stronger in chase than Wraith, Freddy, Bubba (let's be honest you're not getting a chainsaw on anybody in most sytuations), Doc except for like 3 windows in the game, Pig, Myers (you're not popping your tier 3 on an injured person so his tier 3 bonus is more situational), Plague without her power up (it's faster to hit someone with frenzy than to stack full sickness in chase) and depending on the map, Huntress.
---
Keep in mind I'm not saying he's stronger overall than all of the killers I've mentioned here, but he's better at chases thanks to getting that first hit completely for free.
---
&gt;This is really not going to happen as often as you think it does. I'd say in my 300 hours it'll happen at least once in about...4 out of 10 games I'd guess? Refer to the above, people know how to avoid it easily, it's not hard to avoid. The only time you get multi stabs is when they are both on a gen and you manage to sneak up and get them both. Which is going to be much harder to do now, since our terror radius is going to be larger.
---
Well yeah, it's not always going to happen. But most of the powers in this game are situational. In the situation when you can use it, it's pretty good. It's free map pressure and people are less likely to heal against you.
---
There is a lot of situational stuff related to killer power.
---
Trapper is amazing provided someone actually steps in your trap and doesn't just run around it or disarms it because they found it before you got to them.
---
Pigs RBT are amazing provided you get good rng as pig.
---
LF can down multiple people with his chainsaw, provided they are close together or in an area where they can't move around.
---
Myers can 4k super fast provided that people ever group up.
---
I know Legion's power is situational, but that's not exactly a new concept in this game. And when it does work out, it's pretty good.
---
&gt;ONE thing that needed to stay was the mechanic of stabbing a survivor multiple times to down them with feral frenzy.
---
No, this along with moonwalking and no penalty for missed hits is precisely the reason why Legion is so despised and unhealthy for the game. It completely sucks out any skill expression and fun out of the chase, as there is physically nothing the survivor can do except to hope that the person playing Legion is deaf and blind.
---
I'm not saying that the change is perfect, I have some minor concerns.
---
-you should see the blood in frenzy
---
Not that because it's needed, but this change is just pointless. Moonwalking got removed, there is no reason to introduce this.
---
-bigger terror radius
---
Again, moonwalking is not a thing anymore. No reason for this.
---
-requiring full power charge to use it
---
It'd actually open up some fun uses of his power if you could use it at a quarter of the power as you can now. Imagine you are chasing someone around the Ironworks window. You get a hit with your frenzy, cancel the power and chase them as normal. They vault the window, and you use your power again for a short burst to gain some distance. Granted, you'd still get stunned, but you would gain more distance than you would by vaulting and chasing normally.
---
I mean he's still really good considering barely anyone has mettle of man, I guess more people will have it over time.
---
Some of us just wanna watch the playerbase burn lol
---
i see that the update really made legion players tilted huh.
---
This is unbelievable I just bought leather face
---
Is there even any hope for us then lmao
---
For a moment i thought i'm on SMITE subreddit.
---
But, yeh i would say so LUL
---
(disregarding the kind-of-butterface, can deal with that)
---
They will be on the ptb on the 23rd
---
I think the reason they catch up is because they're going in a straight line while you are trying to be a little unpredictable. Also, pretty sure they get bloodlust when blinking as long as they don't break chase
---
Mikey and them were the only killers I really enjoyed playing, and I've never minded them much to play against so I'm a bit sad to see the changes they're deciding to try out for a fix. Clearly they saw a reason to push out something though, and we don't know the exact numbers for all the changes so I'm not going to say much until I can see that and play the new version myself.
---
How was he nerfed? I don't remember
---
Rancor counters MoM are you slow? 
---
Let the obsession get his Mettle off, heal up and boom, guranteed mori at the end of the game, even if it doesn't get that far, your still going to have wall backs on him. And if he 99%, I hope your not so bad at killer that you can't find him for the rest of the game.
---
I've had that problem too! I assumed it was a bug, but I don't know. Thankfully I haven't seen it in a while
---
[That](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLdbvMLYY5E)'s the only video from him I remember watching. And that's enough for me to be sad about seeing this channel disappear.
---
I meant the squiggly indicator if there are survivors in his terror radius.
---
Hey just wanted to say I think these changes are exactly what Legion (and the game) needs. Funny thing is, I was saying he can be reworked like this long ago (and also I heard you had this version of Legion during his gevelopment). Can't wait to test it in action!
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Patch_Notes_1.8.1
---
While I agree the nerf may have been a bit much it needed to be done.
---
Legion was the least fun killer to both play as and against bar none, I will openly admit that I rarely DC but against Legion it was a constant thing as there was no counrerplay and matches just lasted too long, were boring as hell and the level of tunnelling and camping with him were downright disgusting.
---
I‚Äôd rather have Legion be nerfed into the ground so as to be totally useless than constantly facing people abusing their mechanics and making every other game as a survivor an absolute chore
---
It stalls the game. The survivors have to mend to not bleed out, then they have to heal else they are downed by a 4.5m/s killer, so easily 50 seconds or so of people not doing gens.
---
I know my new tier list for the game would be:    
---
SS - Nurse    
---
S - Spirit, Billy       
---
A - Huntress, Hag, Myers, Plague     
---
B - Trapper, Clown     
---
C - Pig, Doc     
---
D - Wraith, Leatherface, Freddy, Legion    
---
The bottom three are pretty much interchangeable
---
Not being able to moonwalk anymore, not downing with frenzy hits and being punished for missing your attacks are all good changes.
---
Needed a full power charge to use the power, bigger terror radius, not seeing blood in frenzy and slowing down the frenzy movement speed aren't needed.
---
How so? They've already shown they can make multi mode killers aka Doctor, it also reuses some coding from the previous ability, the mask putting on and off could be as simple as a slight animation and then you're a "survivor" so 3rd person cam and ability to crouch, which they have the coding from the survivor, and he's a proper size for the camera height and such.
---
Not really, he's just noticably weaker but also way healthier to go against.
---
I can tell you right now that those changes are not fun for the people that actually play Legion, but hey you can have fun junking them once and watching them suffer. That doesn't seem very fun for everyone. Just for the survivors, like most everything else.
---
Legion was awful in terms of balance prior to them, so most of those changes are warranted.
---
Not all of them, but most.
---
Just work alone on a generator. Try to hit perfect checks, but if you cannot, just hit normal checks (the ones where your progress stops during ruin but it doesn't explode). If you only hit a normal check, let go of the generator, count to 2 or 3 and start working. If you get progress immediatly you waited long enough. This will prevent you from getting skillchecks before you've had any progress.
---
Amazing feedback, would you care to explain why?
---
A Legion that Frenzy hits you twice and then follows you while looking up/down/behind themselves in order not to initiate chase state, until you bleed out or get downed with another unavoidable Frenzy hit or normal hit, is certainly overpowered and gamebreaking, not only annoying. Same for Frank's Mixtape Legion. And even an add-on-less Legion that does not exploit Deep Wound but merely commits to survivors and stabs them over and over is gamebreaking, in as much as it still removes most of all thought and skill from the gameplay, still guaranteeing that the respective survivor goes down without being able to do much of anything against that - it's just not OP because the time it usually takes to guarantee that down allows other survivors to finish generators before you are through killing them all this way. (That is, if the survivors actually do repair generators - random survivors regularly don't.)
---
Legion in its current form is fundamentally flawed and anti-gameplay. I do agree that their ability won't be as conceptually interesting anymore once it cannot down survivors, but it won't be "useless" either - it will still be very valuable, deriving survivors of health states easily, either wasting their time or making them much easier to locate and down. It is kind of boring that BHVR's solution to make Legion actually provide interactive gameplay is making them have to chase survivors regularly, but then again, the chase is the most engaging and exciting, skill-based and fun element of this game, and at least Legion will have the flavor mechanics of Frenzy to do half a chase's work, then with a little more interactiveness in that Frenzy chase as well.
---
Now I know why Jason isn't in the game, devs don't want to see poor Jason to get bullied by a P3 Jane and Caludette aka the most overrated character in the entire fucking game, please stop playing as claudette
---
Alright then, I guess you must not have any valid points against my suggestion, good day :)
---
Call me a conspiracy theorist but I suspect its damage control that made it pop up in the shrine this week.
---
Besides, you only go against Legion sometimes. Ideally, only 1 in 15. I play as legion almost all the time, like 12/15.
---
Unpopular opinion: I actually like the changes, and also I wanted pretty much the same long ago. Hyped to test it now.
---
Just gen tap
---
And I was literally this close to buying him with my shards, thanks for changing my mind bhvr !
---
I'm just waiting for dedicated servers to play again. I miss the game but the long waiting time and lag are not worth it.
---
Legion is very weak when they're played "fair". When you face a Legion with Frank's Mixtape, or one who "moonwalks" you to death, you may change your mind.
---
Legion has to charge is power to full bar to use it. Also, his speed while in Feral frenzy is greatly reduced. Now applying Deep wound to many survivors will be near impossible if they're not grouped up. And if Deep wound stops while in the killer's terror radius, it makes it very easy to continue to repair gens or flashlight save near the killer, when the power was designed to affect survivors progression on the generators. The only good point is that this killer is going 4.6m/s, but with he's pointless power he's still lesd efficient than other 4.6m/s killers.
---
I'm looking forward how Legion will perform in the upcoming meta. I hope he works again, because i spent 10 dollars for Susie and leveling up this killer is not going to be a waste
---
What if you run SC and BK? Or all three?
---
I wonder what a meme build on Legion would be..? No frenzy legion, ok bye.
---
Lmao true. Legion was dumb. This ‚Äúrework‚Äù was just lazy. Though I believe cold dirt+Julie‚Äôs still works so Nbd. Speed change sus tho
---
They through him in a lake with concrete boots,
---
Which part?
---
Can you read?
---
Is that kinda new? I'm a killer main and I play survivor for dailies and I noticed the bar turned red when someone else hopped on, but I thought it was a perk or something.
---
But can they like go on record saying yes, we pick the perks or say it's just a huge coincidence?
---
Pretty sure this is what‚Äôs happened to him anyway have you read the patch notes.
---
Yeah basically. Just another M1 killer except this time you paid extra for it.
---
No me.
---
No  - - please, - - stay
---
This subreddit has a VERY whiny player base. Every time there is something positive, there would be some actual positivity going on, but then the hand wringers would come along and whine and complain "oh it's only a small update" or "now if they would change THIS finally...". Like ffs.
---
These guys said It, Doc is good for farm, but there are others also. For farming avoid Insta down killers like Billy, since you lose out on chase points. Next thing you want is to use their killer ability a bunch to rack up those points. Docs is the easiest to use, but you could also use hag, or the clown if you can hit them right after using those killers abilities.
---
Where i can see those notes?
---
Trapper
---
Considering survivors are often down-voted to hell by killer mains, it's a wonder why they don't post much feedback... If you want a killer main circle-jerk, though, guess that's your prerogative.
---
They tested this out, end game is a bit weird right now but they wanna change it. It's possible the hatch may be completely different soon. Until then we just need to be patient :)
---
Did they nerf him? And how so?
---
Not at all, it doesn't need to be instant but if the killer is next to you for more than 10 seconds and hasn't hit you just let them move through each other.
---
UPDATE: Restarting steam and my PC doesn't do anything. After playing a few more games I ranked up to 14 again, then before my next game I ranked down to 15 with only one pip this time. I am so confused.
---
This video was his funniest meme yet.
---
Go for it, it won't get you unbanned.
---
Actually from what I‚Äôve seen, it‚Äôs because people were complaining it was too easy to escape for survivors and it was bs that the exit gates opened when the killer closes the hatch, and not because survivors didn‚Äôt like it.
---
Makes it to where he can't tunnel so fucking hard as he used to or abuse mechanics in a way not intended for the game... and now killer mains who liked to do so are busy making a river with their tears.
---
There were no problems with legion needing to be nerfed I think. He was easy to play against in the big picture, but in those 1v1 chases almost 0 counterplay, but even then he still wouldn‚Äôt be able to end the game, just make it go on FOREVER and that‚Äôs all I wanted to change. Him to be fun and for the games to not take a million years. The vocal few weren‚Äôt giving enough information for BHVR to fix the issues and BHVR just made a decision on what they were given.
---
Supposedly, you're supposed to get an easy first hit, then all you need to do is follow up with a second M1 hit. This is easier to manage with 115% movement speed. 
---
Survivors that are injured by deep wound can either heal or risk going down by not healing. 
---
But in all honesty, it's nothing special. 
---
Good survivors are still going to loop your brains out. 
---
Legion may not turn out to be complete trash like a lot of people think, but he isn't going to be anything special.
---
The reason top tier killers are where they are is because of their chase potential. 
---
Legion can score an easy first hit, but that's it.
---
This is for PC, not console, they are basically 2 differ games :p
---
Don't worry, boys. We all know the true star of the show is Bamboozle
---
then tell me how was it fun to play him. how is it fun to have at least one dc every game? how.
---
Because there were further issues, such as folks abusing the gameplay mechanics in ways not intended for the game (i.e. moon-walking legion) and just down right not fun exploits of his abilities to tunnel and be disproportionately difficult to escape from.
---
That means they should listen to both sides this seems extremely one sided.
---
They weren‚Äôt complaining about him being hard to play against, they said he‚Äôs unfun to play against. Hardly anyone struggles beating a Legion without the ‚ÄúOP‚Äù add ons or abusing. The games take forever to play and it‚Äôs not entertaining to sit there mending for the majority of the game.
---
Freddy is fundamentally broken because he requires an extra action before he can interact with any survivor. That means if someone is awake, and survivors play properly, Freddys requirement can be abused and he may not be able to do much of anything. That being said, people aren't perfect and this is more of a swf problem. People can still play well with him, and survivors can still play badly. His perks are pretty good too, but perks are perks
---
Yeah it's frustrating picking between walking everywhere so you don't waste the SB or using is every time you want to run somewhere and risk not having it if you end up in a chase
---
Wow I finally broke last week and bought leatherface thinking bbq will never be in the shrine I‚Äôve waited long enough and sure enough it shows up the next week lol
---
ptb hasnt happened, you have no idea.
---
It's actually scary looking at all these comments defending Legion because they lost their only crutch
---
Yes. But DS is the equivalent of putting down an uno card. DS is a perk yes, but it‚Äôs power is unrivaled. I don‚Äôt get why everyone is yelling at me for stating a fact. She wouldn‚Äôt have escaped without DS. Y‚Äôall keep pushing with the argument ‚Äúshe was good before so she would‚Äôve escaped anyway.‚Äù Does it matter? Germany was pretty good in 1942 but that ended badly. The beginning never determines the end result.

&gt;game is poorly optimized since day 1 and has only been getting worse recently
---
&gt;release updates with game breaking bugs
---
&gt;don't fix said game breaking bugs for 4+ months
---
&gt;rather they release more cosmetics and DLCs
---
THESE DEVS DESERVE OUR MONEY! ~~you are doing that too much. try again in 4 minutes.~~
---
the username alone made me laugh
---
You're complaining about their frenzy requiring some skill now?
---
Well thing is I‚Äôm a 4,5 midget so I‚Äôm gonna get the Hag treatment tbh.
---
Well right now I‚Äôm rank 4 and I can‚Äôt even find a single survivor while my friends are rank 10 and find survivors instantly. There might be something wrong with it but it might depend where you are. I‚Äôm from Australia so that might be why it takes me ages
---
I‚Äôm usually a survivor but do like playing as the doctor and the shape üòÅ
---
true, he's great at shutting down loops if you time your zaps right
---
Just imagine *paying* people to make you *taller*.
---
Well yeah but it looks weird doesn‚Äôt? I mean some killers like Doc and Plague have to be y‚Äôall for their powers but what if the survivors were as tall as the killers.
---
[] Misguided survivor salt 
---
Difference between complaining about facecamping essentially stopping someone from playing the game, and trying to get Tombstone Myers removed
---
lol. 
---
If it's up to you people everything's broken and should be removed except the "reworked" legion
---
Then why does he need a nerf and not a fix? People were crying OP before moonwalk on him waa discovered.
---
I think the cap is 31,900. I could be wrong but I think a perfect game on a killer gives you that.My highest on survivor was like 29,900 and I can‚Äôt seem to go higher than that
---
Hag is better than Huntress? 
---
Decisive is that low? which moron made this list?
---
&gt; it can easily be fixed
---
Or not? I already gave you an example why it wouldn't be so easy.
---
I'm actually in gamedev myself, and usually it's much more complex to fix something than community likes to believe, trust me. Yeah, BHVR are to blame for their bugs of course, but I just don't understand how people can justify themselves for using exploits that are basically ruining all the fun for everybody.
---
I know I never find anything recent that is worth commenting on so
---
One person made it, 100s voted.
---
:(
---
well its pretty shit
---
I know but I never find anything recent that is worth commenting on and that page never let's me post anything on it although they'd be good posts
---
It‚Äôs 32k for both
---
Trying to hit survivors in Frenzy when the game runs like a picture book was already daunting enough.
---
Because the fucking exploit has been around for 3 years..
---
Don't forget the BBQ in shrine as well
---
I think it became such a meme to hate legion that people forgot what truly made legion so bad
---
Tbh legion really isn't as bad as people say, it's just that a few things were broken or exploitable
---
Play Nurse or Hag. They require you to use your brain, unlike Legion, but can easily deal with loops.
---
They didn't fix Legion they just murdered him
---
I wanted it yesterday and got it today, perfect timing. Didn‚Äôt even know it was weekly, thought it was daily.
---
i do so bad as Frank and I realize its just a aesthetic change that I wont notice but i feel like if I look like a default i play like a default
---
as a legion main i must say this is fucking bullshit.
---
I just learned all teachables to make my legion work like a dream and now i get kicked in the nuts like this? ffs..
---
Who gets nerfed next after survivormains cry? Billy? Nurse? smh
---
Funnily enough I already had Franklin‚Äôs and Knockout from the shrine of secrets. I held out a long time for BBQ but when the dlc went on sale I caved. I basically just bought LF for BBQ.
---
I don‚Äôt play killer so I don‚Äôt care about bbq I just hate it üëåüèª
---
I can't watch the video at work but I definitely do think that rank matters, especially now. I've been a rank 1 killer and red rank survivor since July and there is definitely a skill disparity in ranks.
---
I agree that Bamboozle is not required, but it definitely cuts a lot of chases short and disables a lot of loops. Yes, there are some survivors that you can make them lose momentum/fast vaults at killer shack and other areas, but this isn't always the case. A lot of experienced survivors have been looping that shack for hundreds/thousands of hours. Triple vault has always been most consistent for me if not running Bamboozle.
---
To me, it's kind of like saying Enduring is a useless perk if you respect pallets.
---
How is this a question?
---
I drop a pallet on her head and then run... like I do with all my dates.
---
Haha, that really made me chuckle
---
I hope that's the case with freddy too. God help fedora man
---
Infinite Life is easily the best choice.
---
If we all pick Infinite Life we're gonna live forever.
---
It's kind of appalling how Legion is getting a rework before Freddy does.
---
People complain a lot about killers as it's supposed to be easy and joyfully. It's a competitive, if you play a "average" killer, people will not think twice before teabagging and spamming flashlight and this is very unfun to play against as a killer. 
---
People think fun is winning and when see something hard to play against, they just DC.
---
Oh I‚Äôm so waiting for it just so we can point and laugh and tell them they missed it because they wanted to take a 2-4 week break from the game!
---
Goddammit. I just bought him today
---
Being in a discord call doesn't make people suddenly become pro players 99% of the time. I've been in my fair share of SWF, and we've gotten our asses handed to us more times than we'd like to admit. Sure, some groups are just iron-clad, but they're very much a minority. I don't think SWF is as big a deal as people make it out to be.
---
As someone said above maybe they are just nerfing him while they think of a rework similar to with freddy
---
Increased slowdown and extra terror i think. Although it's not that bad as legion's
---
Looool I literally just bought leatherface like a week ago and got BBQ unlocked fuck me
---
The community of this game has severely grown over the past year. It has a cult following that will continuously spend money and on the other side some casual gamers that just have the vanilla version and will play eventually. Those here for the long run, like me, are happy with how far the game has come and would like to see it keep growing. BHVR doesn‚Äôt have the overtime is required mentality and we have to appreciate that. By all means complain when something is wrong but respect and support your developers for their hard work.
---
+100 IQ
---
I bought my bubba back in October, I wasn‚Äôt going to wait around for the slack devs to put it on the shrine, it was the best $5 I have ever spent and bbq-chili has paid for itself since then! More like 1,000 times over it‚Äôs paid for itself!
---
it was fun playing as this games equivalent to ghostface, a fast killer who keeps stabbing you and slowing you down over time
---
That's pretty fucking crazy. All over a video game too. I think I may need a new router now as well. Ever since that match everything is all out of sorts.
---
I like the changes, simply because legion was supposed to be a stall killer and a snowball killer. With much more duration it will be much easier to hit several survivors then chase one out of frenzy. Also, with certain perks, you can force survivors into a bad situation. Thanatophobia+sloppy butcher makes it so they either take a long time first mending then healing or they take that 12% action speed reduction.
---
I mean yeah i guess. I was trying to be more articulate than that
---
Yes. It is.
---
Having trapper in the same tier as bubba and Freddy is pretty ridiculous
---
I didn't really understand why everyone hated him tbh. I liked playing as and against him
---
I feel like they should make frenzy take longer then, like really long so you have enough time to stab multiple people even though they're not bunched up. If you can't kill with his power you should atleast be able to debilitate multiple people to slow the game down.
---
hehe
---
Behavior, they‚Äôre the devs
---
I definitely agree. I think they'll figure out. As long as stabby-stabby, moonwalk, mend simulator is gone ill be happy. I don't hate legion as a guy, i just hate what he does :p
---
I mean trapper is the only killer who can have his power ‚Äúdisabled‚Äù. Also has to spend time setting up. His traps don‚Äôt really help in an actual chase, unlike hag who can place as many as she wants. Trapper is limited. At the end of the day he‚Äôs an M1 killer.
---
u/lykonic I guess you can have it now lol
---
Lmfao! Finally someone nailed what the community has been like! But I‚Äôm still seeing back and forth reactions about legion, but I‚Äôm glad he got the nerf hammer and as of last night I didn‚Äôt have any legions to worry about, since no one was playing him with the banning going on and then the nerf hammer smacking him down! Can‚Äôt wait for the update patch and see how people play them, PS4 platform btw
---
I can see it now: 
---
"Survivors can never be woken up by any means once put to sleep."
---
"Increased the base action speed reduction of Asleep Survivors by 50%."
---
"Freddy can now Blink by using the secondary power ability."
---
"The auras of Sleeping Survivors inside of Lockers are now visible to The Nightmare."
---
"Decreased The Nightmare's movement speed from 115% to 110%."
---
Bodyblocking and not moving untill they are forced to DC is actualy a banable offense. Its considered holding the game hostage and is has actualy been stated by Behavior that bodyblocking excessivly is banable.
---
I know.  I wanted to give him a shot.
---
YOU DID IT BRANDON! I'M SO PROUD OF YOU!
---
*seriously*, this is funny as fudge!
---
I tested verticality for terror radius with a friend in KYF and THE GAME still seems strong with doc.
---
Treatment mode grabs are 100% a thing. IDK if they still are (I think a while ago hook-grabs were removed but hatch-grabs still worked) but they definitely used to be a thing. I used to camp the hatch spamming m1 as fast as possible and it was impossible for a survivor to get the hatch.
---
True fix the bs moon walk and the never ending mending time with the double blade add on! I do like how they will stop the mend timer while your mending, unlike now where it runs out and the legion finds you.
---
Well what i'm saying is, no matter how good you are, 360's and all, legion will hit you 98% of the time so no matter what you have to mend. Now he better hope it hits or no ff. I hate out-moving a legion 2-3 times and then it finally hits me
---
Sorry but jendenise is another toxic streamer that deranks to bully new players
---
Whats the blood web bug? I havent seen it yet.
---
Makes sense
---
As there is ‚Äòxp‚Äô in this game, Bloodpoints do no equal xp.
---
You deserve an award, remember his legacy.
---
They didn‚Äôt just murder him, they beat him with logs before kicking him up shit creek aisle into a septic tank waterfall which exploded into a disgusting pile of BHVR‚Äôs genocide of the entire Legion‚Äôs worth, if they even had worth to begin with. (All honesty though, they butchered the legion to a T.)
---
Yeah read it 5min. after drawing it
---
Yep. So not fun to play as, or against
---
some docs run cancerous builds thats just annoying and it holds the game hostage.
---
Not every single Legion player went in with Franks Mixtape/SWS or abused the mending capability or moonwalked on survivors for easy downs. How were they a killer with training wheels? By that logic so Is Nurse because she too can ignore pallets. I‚Äôd have to tag as many people as I could with frenzy, pick one of them to chase normally - which meant either a 110% movement speed which was absolute ass around big loops or ignore the loop by using little bursts of frenzy. Legion players who didn‚Äôt abuse the mechanics actually did have to work for a kill and I don‚Äôt know where this mentality of ‚Äúlegion gets free kills‚Äù came from because... I sure as hell would like a free kill. Half of the time at red ranks I get maybe 2 kills out of the game by the end, and again, this is playing without add one or cheese mechanics.
---
Lol I‚Äôm the Nea in this
---
I was stoked about that. Finally got Dance with Me leveled up and just needed that from Feng so glad I don't have to waste bloodpoints on her.
---
Too late, he already deleted it.
---
RIP. One of my favorite videomemes of DBD was there. Compilation #2.
---
With all the other changes,  I'm not sure that the Feral Frenzy speed Nerf is necessary.
---
Not what I‚Äôm saying. It‚Äôs just a smart business model, creates more money. A bunch of people were complaining they ground away their points, and a bunch were like ‚ÄúI have $5 to spare, yay‚Äù to get more points to GET the perks. That‚Äôs my only point. It‚Äôs not some conspiracy it‚Äôs just how people make money.
---
you are literally one of the only people who thinks Clown is bad. dare I say that has more to do with you as a player/your playstyle than Clown as a killer?
---
Freddy's been memed to death but it is true that he cannot play as reactively as other killers and has to wait to start punishing survivors. his tracking and stall go away after one botched skillcheck and that's not even mentioning the Freddy jank where he can be stunned before he is fully visible to you
---
Definitely lithe
---
His frenzy is useless now. Why would you use frenzy at all when you‚Äôre going to be penalized TWICE for using it? 
---
I love that I haven‚Äôt seen a single person who plays Legion say they love this nerf package. Only survivors rejoicing lmao.
---
Entity be damned. Guess we‚Äôre doomed to repeat history then.
---
Yeah, it infuriates me too. Yet I think disabling killer's collision would create some unpleasant bugs. I had another solution, but nobody likes it. I think it just hard to think of solutions to this issue
---
Calm down guys legion can‚Äôt just tunnel now, he has to bounce and chase out of frenzy
---
The whole vaulting pallets and windows mechanic was hand holding. So was the no cooldown on missed attacks. Abusing strong addons and cheesing chase mechanics was only half of the issue.
---
Nurse is by no means a training wheel killer. She is op, that's true but nurse actually requires skill to use. Nobody can just pick up nurse and destroy everyone's fun
---
I play more killer than survivor, I'm legit just trying to theory craft things that might work. I'm not bitching about Legion. I'm one of the few that actually enjoys FACING current Legion.
---
NANI THE FUCK
---
Sometime i wish the devs would listen/ask faces of the community for balance im talking ardetha/Puppers/monto/noob3 those if we ask them the question: how to balance legion to have fun playing with and against. they would come up with great ideas and balance tweak. Pretty sure the game would not be terribly balance. Im personally done with the game for the only reason that this happend all the time and they don't seem like they are really listening to what the community is saying yes legion was terrible to play and to play against but to do this. That was not what they should have done. (I mean if you really want to remove a killer that badly remove him amd refunds the community for 1/3 of the dlc. ( this is my opinion ) )  Anyway maybe one day the devs will understand that they should ask the right person to do something the person that there literal jobs is to play the game. They know what they are talking about they played that game for many manyany hours.
---
His deep wounds were never meant to down people, it‚Äôs a stall. Legion can now injure multiple survivors at once and then chase out of frenzy a lot easier. The reaction to the legion change is huge for what it really is.
---
NOO I WANTED TO WATCH HIS VIDEOS ONE LAST TIME
---
It is very specific. I'm just trying to find scenarios where even using Frenzy in any way may be useful at all. I'm kind of coming up dry which is why I'm resorting to Tinkerer now.
---
Doesn't work on most loops unless the surv has single-digit IQ tbh
---
Honestly, that's fine. The shrine offers a way to access DLC content without paying and still have less of an in-game grind for it (at least if you're mostly looking for one specific perk of a character). This can fuck over their revenue streams so it's in our all best interests that they make sure it doesn't.
---
No, the tunnel with it is same shit, basically abused frenzy to down someone and only that one person. Legions were dividied Into tak groups: one that was actually playing him well and survivors felt actually good versing him as you simply dont focus on one person and you injure everyone (at least try) and dont abuse frenzy so that you for example down them with m1. And there was the second group simply abusing shit out of frenzy and only getting one kill if rest of the team wasnt stupid
---
Completely gutted killer. No reason to heavy nerf deep wounds but you also add, ‚ÄúTerror radius increased‚Äù and ‚ÄúMend timer doesn‚Äôt go down in killer‚Äôs radius. 
---
Can I get my DLC and Joe skin refunded?
---
3 seconds of being able to do nothing works most of the time.
---
K Sper is a really angry guy it seems
---
ü¶Älegion is goneü¶Ä
---
I've gotten like 700 before and I've gotten over 500 many times
---
I'm think this is temporary until they do a complete rework. Or maybe not but they definitely don't have time for it now. People are mad that they didn't rework instead of nerf. Honestly i'm happy either way as long as we don't have to deal with his annoying ass
---
Idk why you got downvoted, this is true
---
He wasn‚Äôt even that good to begin with now he‚Äôs been completely neutered all because salty survivor mains didn‚Äôt want to come up with actual counter-play to The Legion
---
So... ignoring pallets and windows is hand holding but Nurse does exactly the same thing. Nurse has a higher skill ceiling, that‚Äôs true, but don‚Äôt say that the ability to ignore pallets/windows is hand holding when another killer has already done that for ages while also being significantly stronger than Legion. 
---
Fine if they want to implement the cooldown if you miss an attack, that‚Äôs fair. One or two nerfs to level Legion out, fine. Nerfing EVERY SINGLE ASPECT about Legion and then saying ‚Äúoh don‚Äôt worry he moves a little bit faster now to make up for it lol‚Äù? Not fine.
---
Not the same things in this game
---
I'm glad hes completely useless. Everybody hated him, and now I'll never have to play against him again. Shame Behavior is completely incapable of reworking a killer, but if they can't make him fair then making him unusable is the second best option.
---
Deep Wound will basically pose no danger now but it'll slow things down a tiny bit.
---
Happened to me just now and a friend a while back... So It's not fixed yet..
---
Even with the flaws, this game is fantastic. Though I've played since console launch. And I can tell you that there used to be much worse problems in this game. 
---
Though, I wish flashlights didn't get nerfed to being nearly useless. I was bad with them before, now I'm downright terrible.
---
"We should cleanse Totems"   
---
HERESY!
---
i have more hours in killer and you don't get penalized twice for using it and i have played legion my only issue with this update is that i have to wait a week to test it and i would like good feedback
---
Can't find it man, go see if you have more luck.
---
have we seen the update yet?
---
Lol so true. If I shake from side to side and walk by hooks but you still wiggle I am just gonna kill your ass for making me question my generosity.
---
I‚Äôll keep digging
---
I can vouch for this. There is no perk I hate more than Franklin's. It makes me do stupid stuff to pick up a crappy medkit.
---
I don't think it was a vocal few. For the first 2 months after he came out if you played against him there was a 90% chance somebody would leave. And him he uses the exploit then that just shoots up to 99%. Tons of people really do hate him.
---
Wasn't the first tweet made on April 1st? If so then it was probably just an April Fools joke unfortunately
---
legion is useless now though,
---
- pauses deep wounds anytime you‚Äôre near someone
---
- does not reduce time from deep wounds on multiple hits
---
- moves only slightly faster than base in frenzy
---
this isn‚Äôt skill required, it‚Äôs a lack of skill required from survivors, so they can die to this
---
Oh üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ it‚Äôs really funny now lol üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Fucking hell.
---
&gt;who can hopefully still body block while stunned
---
He can't
---
I never said he was a good tier killer. Most people say nursen is god tier but I have so much fun playing against her.
---
I think after this update he'll be too weak. I think the whole bleed timer in terror radius not going down is too much especially when he can't hit you multiple times anymore. I think he needs a movement speed buff now. Then he'll be just like the otherbkillers that rely on m1 for the final down like huntress and clown. The mending bit is just to slow the game down. Also the terror radius increase is partially a buff because they'll be able to see heartbeats more easily. 
---
Since this is just being tested in the PTB they're gonna make quite a few changes during that time I think
---
Tunneling in a problem inherent to the player, not the character. Hillbilly can be a way better tunneler if you just run back to the hook immediately with the saw, yet nobody complains about HB being a tunneler's pride and joy.
---
Legions terror radius is also huge now for some unknown reason coupled with the fact that bleedout timers don‚Äôt go down if you‚Äôre in the terror radius, regardless if you‚Äôre being chased.
---
I can already see survivors just finishing a generator or doing fuck else they want because when you tag people in frenzy, whoever you end up chasing is usually still close to the other people you tagged - so I don‚Äôt even see how there will be an immediate need to mend now? It sounds like survivors will just be able to put off mending for as long as they please assuming you‚Äôre chasing someone nearby. 32m is huge compared to 24.
---
I'm just glad I got them to 40 for my Iron Maiden to be teachable before this happened RIP
---
he was able to jump in asap
---
What platform do you play on?
---
r/dadbydaylight
---
His power is still really good, you have a longer duration so you can hit more survivors and get them into deep wound and now they have to heal because you are 115% movement speed so there is more danger in not healing, and you can add sloppy and thanophobia and slow the game down a lot.
---
No, just no.
---
You get a massive slowdown as you charge the shock, you need at least a moldy electrode to even use it, which effectively increases the slow, the surv usually can just loop the thing again whilst you look like an ass-clown.
---
It only works on dead-end windows/pallets or loops that are really long like the basement god-pallet in Gideon (provided only 1 of them is up).
---
I never experienced that. I guess if he was exploiting something like that i wouldnt care its like freddy sluging everyone exploiting the fact he has built in deer stalker.
---
I‚Äôm devotion 3 level 50 üò≠ you‚Äôll get there all you gotta do is keep trying üòä it becomes easy
---
This is hilarious. Would have been perfect if not sideways /:
---
I mean, Legion is a plaster they had to rush because of player outcry. Freddy is over a year in the making whilst also reworking a large part of the game for him to fit into.
---
How does it hold the game hostage...?
---
Salty survivor post without any knowledge how to counter a killer. No, he won't be better. Only buff for him is movement speed and it's literally useless.
---
All depends on your position and theirs, you just need to time it right, I'm a frequent doctor player and I never have a problem with survivors avoiding my shocks.
---
It is the camera switching and animation of removing the mask. Plus picture the Rage of survivors when they can no longer hide due to a killer seeing in third person.
---
Thank you for your sacrifice. o7
---
It's called a ddos. As the killer you're the host so it's easy to figure out which ip address is yours. From there you just send alot of packets  and fry his router.
---
I personally think Bubba is one of the most fun killers to play as or against. It makes me sad that so many people are angry about paying for him just to get BBQ.
---
Ok, they also made it so you won‚Äôt bleed out from deep wound as long as you‚Äôre in the killers terror radius while also making Legions terror radius half of the size of the map. When you tag people with frenzy and chase someone, they‚Äôre still more than likely within 32m of some of their friends. So now, instead of all survivors being forced to mend immediately when they‚Äôre tagged, they‚Äôll be able to finish a generator or jack off or do whatever the fuck they want as long as they‚Äôre within 32m of you - so not only is feral frenzy now useless outside of seeing where other survivors are, but survivors won‚Äôt even be forced to mend, I can already see SWF groups cheesing this tactic (‚Äúkeep him busy near here we‚Äôre almost done with this gen‚Äù).
---
It wasn't really a singular nerf that was the issue (they made it so that you didn't have to wake people up off the ground before healing them, healing them from dying to wounded wakes them up longer slowdown after tagging someone and iirc longer transition period)  but it was the fact that he was already weak, and he got nerfed because people who were playing the free weekend it came out review bombed the game
---
Did you miss that frenzy lasts longer? With the right add-ons und perks it means lasting longer in a chase to get survivors.
---
Hope so
---
I literally main Doctor and know pretty much all the timings, any survivor, with braincells, will just take another loop around the tile, if they sit at the pallet or cut the corners like shit, then they're not good enough to be considered as players. You can stop SOME loops, but most of them just rely on the survivor not understanding how Doc works.
---
Weird how ebonies are still in the game. They nerfed brand new parts into the ground and they are still ultra rare. But ebonies are the most broken thing in the game and they're still in the game.
---
I actually enjoy him. Survivors get weirdly greedy around pallets against him.
---
Was he nerfed again? Can‚Äôt find anything on it
---
With a slower frenzy it may, imo, be easier to hit because it can be more precise.
---
Iron Maiden is dope on Huntress for faster reloading atleast lol
---
Nice juking, but man that legion sucked lol
---
Lol you‚Äôre right
---
Susie finally stepped up to Julie and frank
---
Not true . As killer you are host . There's only 5 ip address in the game when you're playing, the host will have the most packets moving. It's super easy trust me. Sometimes octosniff works but consolesniffer works 95% of the time.
---
Once you figure out which one is killer you just overload them with packets
---
You got a dynamic IP? Turn your Internet off for a few minutes. Should give you a new one. 
---
If not ‚Äî call your ISP. Tell them what's going on.
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial_of_Service_attack
---
Legion would be significantly less controversial if he required skill to use. People would complain nearly as much if he was as difficult or even harder to use than nurse. 
---
I dont know why are people complaining about the nerf so much. Did it make legion way worse? Yeah probably. If you really think about it Legion is pretty much better Wraith. I'd much rather have underpowered legion awaiting buffs than a terrible for the game's health legion
---
Well in this clip his bottom claw has some kinda disease that makes it soft enough to bend like a thumb so he's clearly cheating.
---
base is now 4.6 m/s
---
Old FF is 4.8 m/s
---
So FF is gonna be between 4.6 and 4.8.... Such a difference
---
Probably consolesniffer. It's the easiest program out right now. You can get a good VPN and it'll stop them from knowing your real ip address
---
I mean it is rank reset BUT he had P3 soooooo
---
I personally use lithe + quick and quiet + dance with me + random perk (iron will/self care, etc.).
---
Yeah one useless killer more, one OP killer less.
---
&gt; You can stop SOME loops, but most of them just rely on the survivor not understanding how Doc works.
---
And there you go! Most survivors don't expect a doctor because hardly anyone plays him! They get zapped and panic, lose their cool. 
---
And yeah I see many idiot survivors wait on the other side of a pallet. I just zap them and rush through.
---
Maybe there are multiple people on the subreddit, with different opinions? And the people in the first panel aren't the people in the second one?
---
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why people are complaining‚Äù 
---
‚ÄúDid it make Legion way worse? Yeah probably‚Äù 
---
Wow you answered your own question there.
---
I always loved Legion! I got downvoted for it, but he was fun. Maybe annoying against but not OP or even strong really.
---
Pass. Her and that fruit are super annoying
---
no if you tag someone with deep wounds it blocks gens like doc tire 3 and his TR isn't the half the map and his power should never down you because that was my main issue legion because right now there is no outplaying his power anything that uses m1 gets blocked by mending so its basically like you shocked some one and hit them one time all for free
---
He seems happy.
---
How do you think the community would react to that? They wouldn't understand and just say BHVR is lazy for not bringing 4 chapters a year.
---
I worded that very poorly I guess. My point still stands.
---
BHVR did say however that when they were originally testing him that they had so many different problems with making them fun to play as and against. To be honest, I think this is a decent step forward. Maybe not the best, but maybe some ironing out could happen down the line.
---
The thing with nurse tho is that yes she can ignore windows and pallets aren't as useful against her but there is still counter play against her. A good survivor can run a nurse because she has counter play. With legion it was more of a countdown until you die with nothing you could do to prevent it. I'm not saying I agree with all the legion changes just that nurse isn't a hand holding killer like legion was.
---
they Freddy‚Äôd a killer. Even if you hate it, nerfing one to the ground isn‚Äôt a solution
---
If this aint the fucking truth. This community blows my mind. Like people just make shit up and always need something to be pissed off about.
---
He takes no skill so you always die to him, but he is terrible at downing survivors and by the time he inevitably downs you like half the gens will be done
---
i'm a killer player i play way more killer then survivor and i hate legion on live on both sides because he is boring because there is no counter but if there is i would like to know because geting hit 4 times by an attack that you can miss 20 times and still hit
---
Finally someone who knows Nurse is not just blinking, Nurse is a little bit OP but not too OP. You have to know how to play her, and if you play against a bad nurse you can mindgame her easily.
---
I hate it when people say Nurse doesn't require skill.
---
Does that mean Nurse cannot catch up to a sprinting survivor without using Spencer‚Äôs Last Breath?
---
I didn‚Äôt say nurse was hand holding I said saying that a killer who ignores pallets/windows isn‚Äôt hand holding by default considering there‚Äôs killers who already do it. 
---
If DBD pulled this shit on any other ‚Äúpopular‚Äù killer and nerfed EVERY SINGLE THING about them people on this reddit would be losing their minds, but because it‚Äôs Legion fuck people who like to play Legion I guess ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Better for him to be unplayable then to remain the way he was. Shame they're incapable of reworking a killer though.
---
Happy cake day
---
No, low ranks complained while high ranks said he‚Äôs fine the way he is and should probably get buffs.  They nerfed him, then he became the laughingstock he is today.
---
This shit is so disingenuous. The solution to what Legion was isn't to make Legion worthless. A sensible re-work was possible and you know this isn't for the better. Give me a break.
---
The general idea is to give The Legion more power to spread around Deep Wounds while reducing their ability to use their power multiple times on the same Survivor, and also fixing some of the more annoying aspects of the killer.
---
Repeatedly using Feral Frenzy on one Survivor didn't offer any counterplay. Feral Frenzy allows The Legion to vault over pallets and windows, so Survivors would more or less be on a timer. Even if they played well and outsmarted the Killer at every turn, they would go down in roughly the same time anyway. With these changes, The Legion cannot down somebody by using their power over and over. They can get that first hit easily, but then they have to follow up with a regular attack to get a down.
---
This is easier said than done when you're moving a 4.4m/s, so to compensate The Legion's base speed was raised to 4.6m/s. This gives The Legion more power to follow up. (It seems small on paper, but in practice you close the distance 50% faster than before.)
---
In addition, The Legion is also able to cover more ground with Feral Frenzy now, allowing them to chain together multiple frenzied attacks on multiple Survivors.
---
That's the short version. There should be a Q&amp;A next week that will go into a little more detail.
---
His power ignores all mechanics of the game, there‚Äôs no getting around that.
---
That stuff needed to be removed, but they took 3 solutions that pretty much would've worked by themselves and lumped it into a giant nerf.
---
dead hard, adrenaline, iron will, bond.
---
Dead hard to prolong a loop, adrenaline because its the best perk in the game (change my mind), iron will to lose the killer if need be, bond to not go near teammates on gens.
---
Community: is way too hard on legion and hates him too much
---
BHBR: does literally what the community asks
---
Community: *angry NPC face*
---
This made my night. I‚Äôm glad this sub exists.
---
One thing I hope they consider is instead of making his ability putting people in the dream realm that everyone just starts out in the dream realm with the sky being gray and stuff (of course they would remove his aura reading but it would be a cool effect for a killer) I don't know what a realistic ability for him could be though.
---
Nobody liked old Legion. Nobody's even pretending to have liked old Legion. The problem is that neutering a character is a poor excuse of a rework.
---
I‚Äôve loved Legion since day one and have only played Legion with the exception of daily killers since they were released and yeah, this nerf package is fucking ridiculous. It‚Äôs annoying that every single person who plays Legion is being punished because some players abuse mending exploits/cheese moonwalking tactics/etc.
---
Answer from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bdx86v/the_legion_update/el220qp/).
---
You only need to down Survivors who have Deep Wounds. You do not need to do so with Feral Frenzy specifically.
---
Cries in console
---
I think I'd just DC life itself
---
I would try him first before clarifying on how good/bad he becomes, but all your points basically can be argued by saying he's 4.6 m/s now. Other 4.6 m/s killers don't need Frenzy to stab someone 4 times and then down them, why would he/she need it now?
---
It's now basically M1 killer with Enduring/Pallet Fury, that has a free first hit, and can stagger the game if multiple survivors are in the same place. Basically good for 3 gen. How is that useless?
---
And also he can't now just tunnel low-effort tunnel everybody.
---
Yeah but you don't get stunned for missing it.
---
Just got off the phone with my isp. They are replacing my equipment in two hours. Apparently I got lucky to still have a semi functional router.
---
Like if you didn‚Äôt use franks mixtape, moonwalk or the mend time glitch he was actually pretty shit, not Freddy but pretty fucking bad. But instead of fixing that shot BHVR banned anyone who uses  it, nerfs legion into the ground, etc. etc.
---
These are the only 2 changes I don't agree with, the bar should go down while you mend because it means you would actually have to find a place to hide and then mend so you don't get caught mending by legion. But since it doesn't go down you can heal whenever and if you get caught mending you will still have your bar almost full and you can just run to the nearest loop. Also I don't like the swing change, I think it should deplete some of your power but not all of it.
---
Literally we were all literally joking about how legion is shit and ‚Äúlegion bad hurhue downvoet‚Äù. I‚Äôve seen several users who were ‚ÄúLEGION BAD REEE‚Äù last week and now are like ‚Äúomg bhvr shittie company boo hoo‚Äù
---
or we're on console and our frames dropped to -60fps after a hit
---
[deleted]
---
She can blink. Pretty sure she can catch up to survivor no mather the addons
---
Its been all over the subreddit the past 3 days including some asshole posting a guide on how to do it.
---
I mean I would still buy it just so I have another killer to play since that is where gameplay diversity comes from. In killer selection.
---
Spencer‚Äôs Last Breath is actually her ability, I mean to ask if she is able to catch up to a survivor by just gliding and not blinking
---
Idk with all this man of metal bullshit sometimes you get tired of running Billy/ Myers and want to shake it up with some bubba time.
---
The budget of the movie had nothing to do with it, they wanted Michael to be a normal man because it was supposed to be that any town could have a Michael just waiting for his time to attack the only time Michael has been ludicrously big was in the Rob Zombie remakes because Rob Zombie just does everything in a over the top violent way.
---
I‚Äôve seen tens of people saying ‚Äújust fix the exploit and he‚Äôs fine‚Äù, people OBVIOUSLY liked the old legion.
---
&gt; Maybe that's their way of removing a character completely from the game while they think about a rework, just as with freddy.
---
Do you think nobody plays Freddy or something?
---
As dramatic as some people are, if I play Legion after these changes folks will still disconnect. Because survivors a drama queens too.
---
I honestly have no idea how to get a VPN. I assume I will need a computer and money though, right?
---
Of course there is a counter. Same counter you that you have for nurse. If she hits you, hide. I won't even mention that you can stun Legion and cancel his power. Also just because he is boring for you doesn't mean that he is boring for everyone. And reminder Dead by daylight is a hide and seek game with extra steps, not play tag till you die.
---
(long sniff of hair)
---
Well I've hated him since day one and I'm glad hes unusable. Would've been nice if they could rework him and make him fair and good but behavior are a bunch of talentless hacks so that's never gonna happen.
---
I PRAYED FOR THIS
---
&gt; describes the two good things about Legion change
---
&gt; ignore the 30 really bad, non-sensible things
---
YOU GUYS ARE BEING UNREASONABLE
---
lol okay guy
---
I do think that he did need a rework because he had very frustrating and unfair parts of his power but they did go a little too far on some parts. Like how your bar pauses when you are mending is super stupid and how your WHOLE power is gone after 1 missed swing is dumb, it should deplete your power but not fully.
---
I have noticed no difference, also the nerf isn't released yet, so I don't think it's preemptively making anyone return. I expect survivors to bring their best with them, no matter what
---
This
---
Go to pc and you can choose your flair
---
It's dope that they're gonna fix your shit so fast.
---
Sucks a phat dick that players can't handle losing, though.
---
Thanks :D
---
That is true. Well, this is only in the PTB so hopefully with some feedback some of changes could be tweaked.
---
Y'all, if you dont have them yet, LF is still worth buying just for his perks. All 3 of his perks are great.
---
Likewise it allows you to negate pallets completely
---
A magical time when it only cost 550 shards lol
---
PLEASE DO THIS.Make it so killer needs 4k to gain the achievement.I played 60+ matches as LF and got it completely out of luck.
---
Ah, sorry, I tought it was one of her addons. So basically, she can't catch up to survivors running away from her in a straight line unless she has bloodlust or a movement speed increasing perk
---
The ugly child
---
Time to waste my frank mixtapes 
---
R.I.P LEGION
---
Definitely would be MoM, ds, exhaustion perk of your choice, and adrenaline.
---
She blends in with her dark bloody clothes and dark skin.  That‚Äôs why so many play her.
---
&gt; I don't think SWF is as big a deal as people make it out to be.
---
Uh no if anything SWF payers seriously downplay their advantages. I noticed that not a single one of you addressed OP's point about map awareness for instance
---
Are you upset that the killer didn't say anything?
---
Self care only conserves the medkit if your healing yourself.
---
I always upgrade characters after the shrine, because this happened to me so many times
---
The entity being repeated enter by a giant black tarantula is killing me lmao
---
I ended up watching that JahCraft movie you told me about while I was falling lol
---
Leatherface is great at the lower ranks, since survivors won't try to run to nearby pallets/vaults and instead try to run you around a tree of something while you unleash your chainsaw on them, which shouldn't really be a problem if you have experience with using Bubba's chainsaw.
---
B&amp;C, this is an opportunity that will go away in one week. The Kate beanie isn‚Äôt going anywhere
---
Just a lil bit - Monto 2019
---
have your mates do totems
---
People use it for bloodpoints more than auras.
---
Well,isn't it the same case here?Legion can't down people anymore in frenzy,so the trophy is voided here aswell.
---
It‚Äôs in mobile as well. Click the ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ and select community flair when looking at the subreddit.
---
If she hits you, hide. That's how you counter every killer! You make it sound so easy :p likewise this game is a chase game, not a hide and seek game, if the survivors never get chased or saved then they get barely any points. It's definitely balanced around mostly chasing and a little stealth
---
Ngl I want a legion jacket/hoodie
---
Its times like this I wish youtube and twitch had actual competition to force them to get better. The problem with that now is the amount of people that use these sites is already so big that it is hard to get into the market and give content creators a reason to go to your site over the big established ones.
---
my friend collects negative comments on his profile, it's hilarious checking them from time to time, he doesn't delete them
---
Everything would've been fine if they just made changes to fix the exploit instead of also fucking Frenzy over completely
---
Yup.
---
Hes good at closing the gap since feral frenzy still lets you run faster and the first hit wounds and applies deep wounds but otherwise is very trash as he is relegated to m1 killer. 
---
Every killer which is relevant has no problem ending the chase OR is so insanely good in other aspects that it makes up for it. 
---
Legion is BARELY better than say a leatherface at chases now and has no utility tools. 
---
So he is essentially as bad as Leatherface/Trapper/BingBong and only slightly better than F- tier Freddy.
---
That's different
---
I never leveled up fast enough to get Frank's tape besides once and I never used it.
---
I'd have to hunt it down, it was from the 1.0 patch days so it's ancient. It was pretty much along the lines of her wanting me to get face cancer and get hit by a bus.
---
Survivor mains are always drama queens. They suck at this game so use scapegoats like claiming NOED being OP even though it never was. They are just awful at chases.
---
Now they act like it's the end of the world because their scummy, cheating assess can't exploit Decisive Strike anymore.
---
Someone call the waaahmbulance for these babies.
---
While Legion is completely shit now, I still would take that over the bullshit that Legion was. Thank you devs for listening to the community.
---
You fucked up when you said trapper is worse than freddy
---
I think the issue is Legion Mains thought BHVR was gonna do something sensible like make an unfun character fun and balanced. Instead, as history has show, its NERF or NOTHING
---
Its almost like everyone on reddit is just reactionary to the hive mind so they can grind karma from everyone that agrees with them. More seriously though the nerfs were a bit overboard especially with the fact their way of "fixing" the moonwalk bug was making it so legion had to be out of terror radius for the timer to go down. As well as other changes that just make his ability negligible.
---
Hag sent u to the shadow realm
---
Yeah, I was expecting to have to wait a bit. But dude I talked to was cool and said he had been ddosed twice playing Halo lol. So he knew how it was. 
---
I wish people would just send their salty messages and move on. Doing this is just pathetic. For fuck sake I worked my ass off to use Nurse on console the way I do now.
---
imagine caring about achievements
---
Am I the only one who doesn‚Äôt care and just plays how I want?
---
I always have self care. Sue me?
---
It‚Äôs saved my ass more times than I could count and I will not stop using it because some randoms on my team think it‚Äôs bad lol
---
Yeah. That's even more pathetic.
---
I've been through the same grind. It's brutal. Her stun animation gives me the worst headache.
---
I was pretty shocked the first time I had my Internet fucked with. I figured consoles would be immune to that shit.
---
I loved playing Legion. I may not have got 4ks every game but I had a lot of fun. Never Jacksoned, looked down, Frank's &amp; SWS, only once dual knived. I am pumped for these changes because it can change the Legion meta.
---
From the looks of it he did it
---
Not on certain games like dbd which uses a peer to peer connection. 
---
On other games like red dead yes you'd need to be in a party with them (or they can just boot all 30 players in that lobby) ... But there's programs like octosniff that can pull your ip address just off your username.
---
Octosniff only works like 40% of the time though.
---
not me, I'm happy as hell! I'm so excited for the upcoming changes! can't wait to see what they do to his power to rebalance him!
---
Look, that was kind of his thing, he stabs you multiple times, he doesnt just stab you once or twice.
---
Now noone is going to stab multiple times because it is literally a hit that does NOTHING. 
---
Even if it took 5 stabs to down someone atleast you are able to use your power in some way, and with the increased cooldown on it and changes to how it works, Im pretty sure it could reach a point where it is relatively balanced. 
---
Now his power is more or less irrelevant
---
It‚Äôs on the front page.
---
oh shit i can stop grinding leatherface????? i should have just about shards to get it.  its 2k right?
---
P3 doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean it‚Äôs a good legion
---
That's generally how I "celebrate" each time I prestige. I run an Ebony Mori and go ham.
---
*Starts with someone else* 
---
FUCK!
---
I play PS4 and there are a couple of tutorials you can play. Try fiddling around and look for it in the settings
---
Imagine somebody telling you Mikey is higher tier than Huntress. Blasphemy.
---
Goddamn it. Now buying Leatherface really was a total waste...
---
Same üëè
---
Freddy is like bringing a scooter to a motorcycle race.
---
I just want a new David cosmetic
---
You are literally being punished for using your power
---
Yeah I know, I‚Äôm saying people who didn‚Äôt like him always threw shit at legion mains and now that they‚Äôve been changed- just so suddenly they like him.
---
you cant hide from legion when he is going at BL 3 speeds and if he has hit someone you are shown in real time
---
I wouldn't mind. Might be exciting.
---
[Me getting toxic messages from atleast 2 of the survivors every game](https://media1.tenor.com/images/74bfcefc3cae44a4364dbe5eb64bbefb/tenor.gif?itemid=8110810)
---
The strange thing is that warning is only shown to you on the loading screen of the match you‚Äôre going into, when there are several tips that show up. But it may never show up first, as the tips for the killer that you‚Äôre facing for the first time shows up first.
---
it doesn't matter how strong he is if no one has fun playing against him anyways
---
It is relevant, it wastes more time than sleeping multiple survivors as freddy (most of the time) since it both injures them and force them to waste more time by mending. Like I said now its more of a free first hit which sounds cool
---
Not me, I still say fuck legion.
---
I love it! The survivors's face! XD
---
‚ÄúbHVR HAS SUCH SHITTY DEVS I CANT BELIEVE THEY LISTENED TO OUR MONTHS OF COMPLAINTS AND CHANGED HIM LIKE WE ASKED, STUPID DEVS‚Äù
---
I feel like I was more likely to escape from Legion than any other Killer. There‚Äôs a reason why even after survivors started keening over them Legion was still at the bottom of most Killers‚Äô tier lists.
---
I'm with you. Either rework the entire killer or just dumpster tier him so I don't have to care about him. 
---
If this makes him worse than Freddy then I'm all for it.
---
Same, and I‚Äôm away this week with no PC access. Fml
---
Feral Frenzy isn't and was never designed to be a tunnel/downing injured survivors perk. Devs are now emphasizing you are supposed to use it as crowd control to stall gen progress. Hit someone off gen, make them run away to mend, and quickly redirect to next nearest person, rinse and repeat (if they balance right, juggling FF might actually be interesting). 
---
By not letting FF down people, this reduces the chance for Legion players to feel pressured into tunneling 1 survivor until hook. Now you have to use some brainpower to decide if your time is best spent m1 tunnelling that already wounded survivor, or trying to find other survs to wound and slow progress with.
---
I'm pretty happy with these changes, and excited to revisit Legion and see if its more fun to play as. I always felt dirty and cheap playing him when I had to for a daily. The core concept of the killer is still there, just nerfed into actual counterplay territory. I do have a hunch they might end up tweaking the terror radius effects on DW, but we will have to see what the add-on changes look like first.
---
the legion nerf isn't justified? he was an ass killer to play against, in order to have fun this is the right direction imo
---
I just have how a lot of ppl are mad at the change before even trying it out that is what the PTB is for. but so far I just see ppl complaining saying survivors always complain and blah blah I honestly find both sides bitch as much as the other
---
i got him to lvl 11 yesterday.  can stop that now lol  gonna focus on the hag next for the ruin
---
not me pal, you have no idea how excited I am for this! the nerf obviously is way too much but still, with these changes it'll be so much better to play against them
---
He gets a free first hit, then survivors have to mend AND heal, or risk being one hit the whole game by a full speed killer. Thats a good amount of time theyre not gonna be on gens. I really don't think theyre gonna be that bad from these changes.
---
You'll first see this in the upcoming PTB.
---
Same, hopefully people will stop playing him all together now. Will only be an improvement for the game.
---
Pig, Clown, Myers, Spirit
---
its reddit, what do you expect
---
hit someone with his power then go after somehow else so he's forced to mend and slow the game down
---
thank you for so elegantly sharing your thoughts with us
---
freakin
---
Jesus Christ, no...
---
But then it comes to the counterplay
---
With billy you run through windows or tight junk so he cant chainsaw and is simply m1 killer. With legion, he just cathces up to you and you cant do shit
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure if Killers started to DC every time they had to go against a SWF with Discord/party chat people would just get banned. It‚Äôs scary to think that survivors can get a character rendered unplayable by doing the same.
---
Because no one deserves the Freddy treatment.
---
Wtf is he even doing, it looks like hes drinking from a straw and scooping with a spoon at the same time? At least he's having a good time doing it lol
---
I don't know if I should pick up bamboozle or BBQ
---
No. The exploit has nothing to do with Legion's base design being cancer.
---
If I had gold youd deserve it lad. Words well spoken. I've bought every dlc to date so far and plan to keep doing so along with any cosmetics I like. Keep up the hard work devs.
---
What's the best way to say "I'm sorry" when you're slugged?   
---
I haven't played since Nurse was a New killer... so I remember flailing arms meaning camping, but now it means something else apparently?  And survivor gestures are always fun but...
---
What's the "I'm sorry I did a fuckie-wuckie" as a survivor when you're slugged? 
---
For example:  I saw someone @ pallet recovering.  When the killer picked them up, I was already ready to drop the pallet and save, but the killer knew I was behind them and smacked me.  So I awkwardly sat there, and wondered "how can I communicate, through slug dance, I apologize."
---
Well tbh I‚Äôm glad that now I don‚Äôt have to deal with a boring killer anymore. Although I think they could have made Legion less annoying and more fun to play against.
---
It's ok someone already did this meme
---
Ugh. I cant wait until this crap is over.
---
Same hes one of the few killers I've enjoyed prestiging and restarting with.
---
Yeah but they just have to mend then they can hop onto a gen. He is going to have no real chances to 4K unless you get potatoes, you‚Äôre really good, or the survivors are farming.
---
How the fuck do you manage to do this and I‚Äôm not able to write a 5 letters word with my finger lmao
---
32m is the normal TR compared to a normal MS of 115%. So that actually checks out.
---
What keeps people from finishing a gen when injured against killers like Trapper, Wraith or other M1s though? Against most of these, you want to heal. And you would want that against Legion, too. Sure, the mending discourages you from healing as it will take longer, but you still kinda want that. (You don't want to right now cause 110 MS is slow af and you can easily loop them long enough). I feel like people underrate standard movement speed.
---
&gt; Nurse takes a long time to learn
---
Takes a "relative" long time to **master**. You can learn how to use her way sooner than that.
---
I am ok with this. Hopefully people stop playing them altogether until they rework it to make them actually fun.
---
This has actually always been why I've avoided playing Legion. Every time I do for a daily I'm so bored. He's not fun to play as currently so I'm hoping this change makes him more challenging and more interesting.
---
I am obliged to subscribe to it. What have you brought upon me.
---
Its literally another "Force the player to play a certain way" type of fix.
---
Legion needed a complete power rework.
---
You forgot one thing in this thread
---
The shitpost flair
---
‚òπÔ∏è
---
"If you are complaining about Legion and you are a Legion main, you are literally exposing yourself." \~ No0b3 2019
---
Instead of making Legion mains and Survivors happy by actually reworking them, they just make Legion trash.
---
bruh moment
---
Freddy only works because survivors act like complete tards against him.   If you unhook in his face because "lol free unhook", you'll both get slept and the unhooked tunneled to death.  Repeat until the last two are slugged and bleed out on the ground for being idiots.
---
you are welcome sir i just needed to get that out i'm a Myers main but when i am wanting to be toxic i would play as legion i pay money for him now he is unusable i kinda want my auric cells back  
---
guess its back to Nurse for toxic games
---
im ok with depleteing some but your should be punished for missing hits
---
Looks like a "Get off my lawn"- situation.
---
Your right, but she can easily be juked unless you mastered it.
---
I bought BBQ and chilli and also bamboozled how the fuck can I add them on my killers?
---
The thing is with Legion since he can vault pallet and windows, you are going down.
---
Survivor mains are cry babies
---
That was a deep analyze bro.
---
&gt;Your right, but she can easily be juked unless you mastered it.
---
Agreed but that doesn't change the fact that her **mechanic** is broken.
---
Legion was unfun to play against because the survivor couldn't interact with him and chases were one sided. Fixing the exploits would make this less viable as a strategy towards a 4k, but wouldn't fix the problem. He needed some kind of kit change. I'm going to wait to see the numbers and the changes to the addons before I call it. Most killers will under-perform without addons.
---
Legion was never overpowered.
---
I'll get those 150k BP
---
my rage or just this crap game?
---
Dont get me wrong i love the game but man people i doing what they did to overwatch and making it unplayable next they are gonna make it so trapper takes a solid minute to place a single trap because traps are "OP" or Myers is not able to stalk at all in tier 3 without tombstone
---
Yeap. Basically all my killer perks are useless on this map.
---
That slug life
---
BARBEQUEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
If anything, Susie's mask can be bought with shards, I would recommend her. I can't remember if Joey's outfit can, but his body is better than just the mask, which is vice versa for Susie, though that's just my opinion.
---
I definitely don't want old Legion back, but this is certainly an over-nerf. They're incredibly boring now, a glorified M1 killer with an initiation and no follow through. It's like playing Pig but without the stealth, and the traps, you just have a first hit and then your power is nothing.
---
You CAN get multiple survivors for some stall, but the time spent running between them wastes as much time as mending gains, and with their TR up to 32 meters, the information from Killer Instincts is sketchy and more likely to result in you running out of power instead of seeing results.
---
Their power is meant to be cool in a chase, vaulting pallets and such, but now there's 0 reason to use it in a chase as it doesn't let you down people any more. You HAVE to just chase at 115 and get looped.
---
Honestly what's the point in deep wounds now? It doesn't affect a person in a chase, or anyone in 32 meters, and when it does its a few seconds of mending.
---
I just can't see what they're MEANT to be now, they're just a really dull M1 killer.
---
I'm curious too ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§î
---
Talentless? Dude you are a fucking idiot. DBD obviously required skill to create, so much so that you are invested in this game enough to come to the subreddit and discuss the game. Yes, they aren't perfect, but they definitely are talented.
---
Sir please tell us where Bubba touched you
---
P3 really means nothing though when it takes so little time to get.
---
I can't believe someone actually messed up this meme format.  
---
It isn't a discount Drake meme, Mr. Sleepyhead.
---
I just want the option to take a dump in the hatch. That way if the survivor jumps in they have to swim in my faeces.
---
Funfact: "Darkness Among Us" was Chapter 10
---
Debating between buying BBQ and saving shards to buy the plague so i can feel accomplished. 
---
Fuck it i dont need to feel accomplished!
---
Oh honey...
---
The exploit wasn‚Äôt the main problem people were complaining about.
---
ah yes lord and savior, teenager noob3, whose word is infallible. bless
---
Can‚Äôt tell if this is serious or not.
---
And that tiny bit is pretty similar in time to the amount of time you spend running from one deep-wounded survivor to the next for a hit, a net gain of shit all.
---
*gets an infinite loading screen and loses killer addons or good offerings for the 2nd time in 1 hour*
---
"YEAAAH DEAD BY DAYLIGHT XDDDD"
---
I am having fun too with the game. I love having to kill it with TM every 30-60min (maybe 2 hours if I am lucky) and losing items and more importantly my own time.
---
Bad sportsmanship.
---
They went completely overboard.
---
Do you always sum up all your thoughts with borderline gibberish quotes? I feel like I'm having a stroke reading your comments.
---
Because "LEGION PLAYERS RISE UP" i mean i never complain about legion, just enjoying to play him, i never seen peoples dc against me, so i just read and skip LEGION IS BAD topics, but yesterday i was shocked, and was like look how they are massacred my boy, this is just rediciolus, why players like me who enjoy playing legion like he is now, should care about peoples who cant play without exploits, and unfair tactics, just leave not decreasing wounds in terror radius it is fair, and change franks mixtape if peoples complaining about it a lot, for me this addon is never was good to be honest, there was better addons around, like red button to read map, filthy knife to slow down game, and leave other stuffs untouchable, legion even not fucking overpowered, you have to hit survivor 4 fucking time, there is still fucking nurse around who ignores everything in the game, and its still fine smiley face
---
Okay let's talk about that. How do you fix moonwalking other than pausing the timer in his terror radius?
---
How do you fix no-skill required, no counterplay tunneling without removing the deep wound timer loss on hit?
---
I've yet to see anyone propose viable alternatives to either of those
---
I think the ‚Äúpositive‚Äù feedback was the cosmetics.
---
&gt; guranteed down
---
jesus must have personally intervened when I was escaping then
---
I wanted to play legion because he looks really cool. But I don‚Äôt want to play legion because everyone hates him. But now he‚Äôs needed so I can play him. But he‚Äôs fucking useless. What a rollercoaster
---
Well, I for myself never cried about Legion. In my opinion the nerf that the timer doesn't run in terror radius was basically enough. Maybe 1-2 additional TWEAKS (not nerfs) and it Legion would at least be ok.   
---
In my opinion for the survivors to counter the exploiter: the terror radius change  
---
For the killers, to make legion less bad: Make mending not stop the timer (and I mean AT ALL, if it reaches zero while you're mending -&gt;down)
---
Hell yeahe

Id rather shove broken glass into my urethra.

I played Doc yesterday with the add ons to increase terror radius and ran my normal distressing on him and a survivor uses a The Game map offering. Literally had three people DC when they first went into madness. Let the last person fix two gens and get hatch after farming a bit
---
This is the hot tea I was looking for in this community.
---
If you don‚Äôt pay attention it‚Äôs hard to miss. :)
---
Thanks.
---
Looking up perks by picture is a pain on mobile. Every perk is like 2 pages worth of scrolling due to descriptions.
---
The people defending them aren't Legion players crying over the loss of their "crutch", they're people who want to play Legion, but don't because they're a bad killer. The update was supposed to make him viable, but instead they practically removed all uses of his power.
---
This is accurate.  The outrage is baffling
---
Then why are you here? Abandon the account and make a new one.
---
And with Pharmacy it only takes a few second to whip out the med kit since it speeds up searches and makes them silent.
---
thanks
---
Make more! This is funny.
---
Legion is ass overall but it takes no skill to down a survivor that‚Äôs why everyone hates him, but his add ones are what made him so fucking infuriating, if BHVR wasn‚Äôt a shitty dev and knew how to balance them, they could remove or change cold dirt and mixtape and people would be fine with the killer, albeit him being weak
---
lol. If you 3-gen yourselves against doctor, you pretty much deserve all the *pun-ishment* you get. ^(I'll see myself out.) 
---
The way I see it working together to dismantle 3-gen clusters is part of playing against doctor. While the survivors spend more time working together and taking more risks to stop the 3-gen, The Doctor gets more opportunities to chase survivors down through loops. I actually don't mind playing against Doctor as long as I don't have potatoes for teammates, unless it's on The Game.
---
That's why I wait for Meg squads. 
---
For real though, people need to stop saying Doc is an anti loop master. He isn't. If people stop saying he is, maybe he'll get some help in that regard in the form of a buff or add-on.
---
If it‚Äôs any condolence looking back on the comment I made at 6 am I‚Äôm also pretty sure I had a stroke reading it, we‚Äôll go down together
---
I think this was mislabeled. Maybe put ‚Äúshitpost‚Äù?
---
I‚Äôm playing at rank 14 and see mettle of man on every one. I don‚Äôt know who these people are that put enough hours in to get MoM then put it on other survivors, but playing that much you would think they wouldn‚Äôt be at yellow ranks with my casual ass.
---
For the meme to have comedic effect, the texts need to be switched. 2/10
---
I like old Legion
---
This format doesn‚Äôt work buddy...
---
Flair checks out
---
Ehat was the nerd. Rank 15 legion main
---
I can't understand what the survivor is raging about. He didn't waste any pallets, made a good juke in open field, chase was decently long.
---
Doctor isn't even a very annoying killer? If you don't want to play, don't queue up.
---
This style of play for them was my favorite and why I typically ran cold dirt with joeys mixtape. With the frenzy speed being significantly reduced though, this may be a lot harder to do effectively.
---
Susie pretty
---
So is Billy.
---
Spin in a circle. It‚Äôs the best method aside from sending a message afterwards.
---
In my opinion with all the changes to survivor the game is in the best state it‚Äôs been
---
Eh, you still have a longer duration to compensate, plus that sweet extra movement speed is always nice
---
now you're getting it
---
So I guess when NOED wasn't a hex you would say just don't get downed right?
---
It‚Äôs not. Get closer to the killeror get in a locker. The Bloodpoint gain is the main reason
---
Clown is actually a really damn good killer once you get used to the way he plays.
---
he was nerfed a week after release
---
This is just absurd. Literally what even. Might as well have removed his power. I would call this a knee jerk reaction but it took them months to come up with this farce. Even the people who hated legion have to recognise that he is now unplayable
---
lmao
---
Fair but depends on the speed reduction. If it‚Äôs smaller than it sounds I agree entirely but if it‚Äôs big then rip.
---
i love legion as a killer main, and i know the fact that survivors hate playing against them but they are so fun to play i'm sorry :/
---
You should level him up anyways. He's actually extremely powerful once you know how and when to use his gas.
---
The joke is they smacc both buttons
---
Only if bhvr nerfs deja vu first.
---
Suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuure. Keep telling yourself that.
---
&gt; If it‚Äôs any ***condolence***
---
Are you still having a stroke?
---
"DID YOU JUST SAY CARTOON?!"
---
-on behalf of the anime community
---
Oh oh, now Legion mains have to actually learn how to chase instead of brainlessly spam Feral Frenzy.
---
Freddy didnt need a PTB to know he would be F tier post nerf and then bam he was F Tier.
---
tell this to bloody double pallets on Rotten Fields and Swamp
---
Honestly,,,yeah
---
Poor Jane lol 
---
Just wanted heals
---
"We got a lot of positive feedback!  However we decieded to not listen to it and delete The Legion"
---
SB is the "gen jockey" Exhaustion perk for when you plan to be spending all your time trying to avoid chases and only want the speed to get to a safe area while working on gens in an unsafe one. The active Exhaustion perks are all objectively better.
---
Im not following you sonny.
---
How do you get your brightness so high? :0 Or did you just brighten the screenshot?
---
Killing yourself on the firsthook still pretty much screws every other survivor. As does DCing.
---
Why are we called ‚Äúpeople of the fog‚Äù?
---
Welp I‚Äôm not touching Legion ever again, I saw him as a fun and fast pace killer that gets me into the action faster.
---
Now, he‚Äôs absolute shit.
---
Thanks BHVR
---
That‚Äôs now his this works lol. The entire purpose of the meme is the decision.
---
Brinf tf out of your moris.
---
I've never said they weren't better, but SB is in no way a trash tier perk, still one of the top tiers
---
Lithe is good. It's also impossible to tell if someone's got it before they use it. No standing still until the killer is close (Sprint Burst), no looking behind them to time the dash (Dead Hard), and no going up on to hills and stuff for extremely obvious drop downs (Balanced Landing). With Lithe, they could just be going to vault a window normally... or be about to run off and leave the killer behind.
---
Yet a lot of the people that legitimately got their legacy can't get them back. 
---
In a sense legacy doesn't mean anything because anyone that doesn't have legacy could still have done the requirements and gotten it, you can't know it, so its just a skin at that point
---
I bought the DLC last week just because of BBQ... Now I have to play toxic camp Leatherface just to make up for it :)

Remember when legion was bad? Worse then Freddy the worst killer ever buff please? 
---
BHVR does nothing...
---
Omg legion so overpowered wtf well I mean he‚Äôs bad yeah but he 4ks every time no counterplay.
---
Then excess Franks mix tape because of Xmas event. Oh yeah hes super op Michael Jackson‚Äôs Moonwalker over here.
---
Then blade combo exploit... nothing to say here that shit is broken and shouldn‚Äôt have happened.
---
Then much needed rework. Awww he was perfect wtf survivors need to get good wow so sad üò¢
---
I‚Äôm starting to think a lot of people complaining on the internet don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre talking about ü§î
---
Now you put that BBQ &amp; Chilli on Billy... Oh Boy!
---
Dude you couldve healed her first then got on the gen together... not everyone runs selfishcare...
---
it used to be 100. I got 100 just by basically throwing the games and farming iri heads on xbox.
---
Allow me to submit that this was never a fun or good strategy and this change will only improve gameplay (and the quality of the average Legion)!
---
Located: joke
---
We wanted bloodhound legion to go away.
---
They simply needed to make deep wound not tick down in TR and blood not visible. 
---
Now it's basically plague #2 since even with current Frank's they'll probably be able to mend in time.
---
It is possible to use more than one perk ok a survivor. Knowing most of them, I assumed that you probably used DS.
---
I honestly don't think Nurse's base kit is a problem. The add-ons are the problem. A good Nurse with Omega Blink pretty much removes the ability to juke. Other than that the only thing I would try changing might be the pallet interaction. Currently she is immune to pallet stuns while blinking. Since she already counters looping, I think that's a bit much. If you could stun her out of blink it would open up the potential for some mind games at pallets.
---
Best place to hide is the Gen completion Bubble. You can't see auras through this and they never expect it.
---
&gt; Legion can bait out pallets
---
Are you already in Frenzy? If so and you're waiting at a pallet then you're wasting time and they can still get away. 
---
&gt;Dont use your power untill they sprint burst? Catch up to them when they stop sprinting?
---
This is when a stopped reading because fuckface completely forgets that Legion's default movement speed is slower. So chasing a guy using Sprint Burst is pointless because you're wasting time and they can make it to a pallet or loop spot where you can't hit them in time because Frenzy ran out. And if you normally chase someone who Sprint Bursts and then pop Frenzy it will take a while to catch up to them and they can still make it to a strong loop.
---
You're not an idiot, just a reatard as per usual for survivor mains that live in their own reality.
---
Nope it just makes it hard no the killer to navigate because you are shaking him harder from side to side. If you are lucky you might get him stuck in an obstacle or when trying to go through a door to be just enough not to reach the hook, but is not super useful.
---
i don't think i changed anything in-game and the screenshot is completely unedited. maybe it's just this map that is bright.
---
I mean if nobody steps in your traps as trapper you‚Äôre just a guy holding a machete. Why should secondary killer powers be dummy proof? Whence the entitlement, ding dongs?
---
i kinda want a refund now...
---
So you think he needs a rework but don't have any actual ideas on how to do it.
---
Sounds like a typical legion player.
---
The only time I never witnessed this type of backpedal was when Nurse lost her 3rd blink and normal killer movespeed.
---
And you assumed incorrectly. Good job /s
---
So it's a worse wraith/pig/any other stealth killer/hag, arguably.
---
A dev commented in the Legion update thread. All you'll need to do is down someone when they have a Deep Wounds timer. So basically, hit them with Feral Frenzy, then with a basic attack.
---
Dodged a chainsaw to the face, nice.
---
I'm not surprised, I knew people would go wild over such a lukewarm comment :P
---
this post didnt age well. rip legion
---
The map is just not that dark as far as I remember.
---
Also. Object of Obsession and the killer brings Dying Light! I can't understand why she's face camping that one.
---
This community just likes to be upset lmao
---
Hag can only place 9 but thats more than enough she also doesnt need to hunt her traps down and they are hard to remove
---
anyone feel like discordance is bad for this game? it's the only perk/feature that really rubs me the wrong way.  the mere existence of it makes me want to never work on gens with other survivors, which can't be the desired playstyle that the devs want from a 4v1 game.
---
That was a great video, thanks man!
---
As someone who actually played him, bullshit. Without Franks or moonwalking L really ain‚Äôt that much better than any other killer at tunneling
---
Sorry, what happened with Legion? im a bit out of the loop with dbd
---
Exactly. What I meant was hag won‚Äôt run out of traps in a chase. Also anyone can disable a bear trap. You need a flash to turn off hags. She‚Äôs pretty solid.
---
Most Freddy's I encounter are campers so I find that if he even hooks me once I'm done for.
---
I was literally about to buy him today when I get paid but now I have both bbq and franklins from shrine so I just saved $5
---
That's where you messed up! You should've bought him with shards... 
---
So you're bitching because you can no longer be toxic with legion?  Take a seat dude. üôÑüôÑüôÑ
---
&gt; I got so fed up with his BS that I started playing Legion only as killer so I could exploit how broken he was until they finally nerfed him.
---
Funny enough, this is the exact same reason I use mettle of man
---
Keep telling yourself that‚Äôs a crutch perk.
---
That makes no sense. The obsession isn‚Äôt the one being facecamped, the killer is letting someone with a massive speed boost do their own thing.
---
Walking everywhere wastes an absurd amount of time
---
That sucks lol. No one expected them to give up the cash cow.
---
Huh didn't know. Thx
---
I‚Äôll keep telling them that too, because it‚Äôs true. Half the time I use BBQ I don‚Äôt see ANYBODY, but I don‚Äôt give a shit cuz I just got a shitton more BP from there on.
---
I will because it‚Äôs true. As long as it‚Äôs on every single killer. 
---
If it was anything like the most closely related survivor perk (WGLF), killers would rarely use it.
---
Agreed. Would it even be op?
---
Have you considered that there are different people that make different posts on this sub
---
I got 7500 shards right now , i‚Äôm thinking about getting jane or adam but oh boy
---
You can just hit M2 to cancel FF any time. So no need to miss an attack. :D
---
I dont think you appreciate the 115% buff enough, with it, he can actually mind game survivors on setups. Here is a video by ScottJund demonstrating this typical tiles [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8u0jRxN2kQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8u0jRxN2kQ) 
---
Plus you forgot to consider that Legion can stab more than one dude when using frenzy, now with the larger terror radius(you can see more people once you stabbed someone with feral frenzy) + travel distance(McLean said new frenzy gets further than the old one), you can create some pressure pretty easily on survivors nearby. Not to mention, you might want to start healing against legion since he is 115% and he can actually mind game loops, throw in bloodhound to increase healing time and you got yourself a killer.
---
No billy is exact 100% ms lf is lower than that
---
Franklins hands down for me
---
There have been a lot of updates to killers because the game has been primarily balanced towards the survivors side for a while now. 
---
Also, I don't think nerfing legion into the ground really supports your argument.
---
It‚Äôs not my job to come up with ideas to change a killers play style. What I‚Äôm trying to say is they did a shitty job doing it. Perhaps you have a better idea?
---
idk what everyone's obsession is with shirtless myers when it's clear that trapper is daddy af. i need a speedo cosmetic stat. fym
---
SHIRTLESS MYERS???? WE ALL KNOW TRAPPER IS DADDY AF! I NEED A SPEEDO COSMETIC ASAP
---
Thank you for putting this, I was about to the the same.
---
Is it a 180 to say "he is unfun/toxic to play to against even if he is weak against a decent team" and now say "the solution to the previous problem was not to make him unplayable?"
---
To be fair, if they took it away I have a feeling a lot of survivors would go hide in a corner somewhere. It‚Äôs not like the Killer can actually find you unless they‚Äôre running whispers. I just let them have it. The only thing that pisses me off is when they decide to wait at the hatch to taunt. Like they outplayed me or something. Like I didn‚Äôt decide five minutes ago to just let you have it and go grind whatever points I still could out of the map.
---
Still waiting on my suit Jeff. ): When will my boy come home?
---
f those guys
---
I got Leatherface a few days ago. I think I will still lvl up Bubba
---
I was thinking the same thing: certain perks could be used to counter the insane nerfs.
---
Insidious after stabbing someone in Frenzy to force them to mend. This all depends on what they do to the add-ons. 
---
Goes without saying but Cold Dirt + Joey's Mixtape might be the new meta. The devs might be clueless enough to forget how effective this combo can be. 
---
Bamboozle for faster vaults so you can catch up and take away shitty loops (even killer shack with a Green Sketch Book could still be an annoying loop if that pallet was still up).
---
Enduring/Spirit Fury might be good too. 
---
The shitty part isn't just the nerfs but they took away one of the things that made the character unique: they didn't need perks to help with the chase. So that gave you some leeway and could use Corrupt Intervention + Ruin to really slow the game down. Now you can't do that. 
---
Oh yeah, I almost forgot, NOED might actually be good since Legion has normal movement speed. So there's that too. I never feel bad using NOED.
---
All they really needed was fixing the moonwalking, some of the addons, and it woudlve been fine.
---
In order to have fun? He's a m1 killer with a useless power now. Might as well just play hillbilly instead.
---
I got downvoted by a bunch of survivor mains for saying the same thing.
---
‚Äúhurr durr don‚Äôt miss durrrrr‚Äù
---
I agree he needed a rework or slight nerf, but they made him worse than Freddy. I can‚Äôt imagine playing as Legion anymore, I‚Äôd rather play Nurse on console.
---
High ping killer.
---
Summon Legion Revert
---
ZzZzzZZzzz.....
---
Yes, go through with these changes. Do small buffs and nerfs as needed afterwards.
---
they made him actually take skill to play not just force players to abuse exploits
---
No this is Red Dead Redemption 2
---
Best one I‚Äôve seen so far
---
oh the ironing
---
Top notch quality
---
I'M SO DONE WITH 3V1S
---
STOP GIVING ME FUCKING 3V1S
---
WHAT SORT OF ABORTION OF A GAME LETS YOU START WITH LESS THAN THE REQUISITE AMOUNT OF PLAYERS
---
IF I WANTED TO DO THAT I'D HAVE FUCKING SAVED $20 AND SAT HERE PLAYING MONOPOLY BY MYSELF
---
STOP GIVING ME 3V1S
---
Alright! Now time to wait 4 months.
---
I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre fun at parties.
---
I knew people would say something about me not healing her but the context of the overall game influenced my choices here. Prior to this he had hooked the other three players several times, I was focusing on gens and trying to get rescues when I could. We had gone a LONG time without a gen being done because it was like an avalanche of him downing people in tier three and hooking them. His play style was very much based on not chasing people down, but getting to tier three and then getting the 1-hit. Based on how quickly he was finding people and his behavior, I figured he had BBQ. So I decide to finish this gen. Once he got his next hook I decided to run and draw him away. As you can see it‚Äôs not like I was trying to be subtle about it until I realized he hadn‚Äôt seen me.
---
He's right, your joke makes no sense.
---
Frenzy for the first hit then play enduring and SP for the second hit , the power duration is increased so its good for map control . New legion is a better Wraith/ Freddy so i guess its not that bad
---
I absolutely hate that it's in the shrine. After the buff to tier 1 and 2 it's very powerful.  
---
Everyone is always like you can counter it. Yeah by hoping theres a locker nearby, or you have the right angle on a gen or hope you're in the 40 meter range...  It's a busted perk that Carrys killers.  I'm a survivor main but when I play killer I rely on bbq because I suck.  Without it I dont think I'd get the same amount of kills/hooks...  
---
It's literally op on Billy, spirit and nurse... rant over lol
---
70 keen redditors would disagree
---
Anime? Is that a good cartoon as well?
---
BHVR MADE LEGION A KILLER THAT ACTUALLY HAS TO PLAY DBD NOW AND EVERYONE HATES HIM WTF????
---
\[FUCKING WRAITH WAS BETTER THAN LEGION\](/intensifies) , HE IS PRETTY MUCH JUST A STANDALONE 115% KILLER. LIKE DO PEOPLE EVEN PLAY THIS GAME???
---
Okay I think that‚Äôs supposed to be a survivor hooked in the basement but honest to God it looks like you just circled a random snowflake.
---
they made him ACTUALLY take skill to play pretty much
---
It may have been the zero counterplay
---
They seem to h ave a thing with killers unable to see there own times. Pig, Plague and Now Legion. Like..why though?
---
It's kinda off that the most demanded killer perk just magically appear in the shrine after a week of great anger and community frustration.
---
Also how survivor sided the last several maps are
---
Not really, Wraith can see blood while invisible, Legion doesn't even get that while in Frenzy.
---
He is more like a crappier Spirit.
---
They removed the moonwalk glitch. Any time you‚Äôre in the terror radius your bleed out timer won‚Äôt go down. You must wait for the entire meter to fill before using frenzy. If you miss an attack during frenzy, frenzy is cancelled. You can‚Äôt down people with frenzy anymore, so hitting them more than once is a waste of time. Frenzy speed is reduced. They do move at base movement speed now.
---
So why not just play wraith?
---
I WISH KILLERS WOULD STOP ASSUMING I'M PART OF A SWF WHEN I'M SOLO QUEUE 99% OF THE TIME. I NEVER ASKED THEM TO BULLY YOU AND I'M SORRY.
---
Can someone explain to a new player what this is. I have a level 30 claudette if that means anything
---
You're right, legion was much more powerful so now they're putting him in line. That's what the difference in degree was. You've literally done nothing but give biased judgement. At least nurse had a skill gap. Legion literally took no skill at all. He was an EASY 4k.... especially with ruin the way it is now
---
Now, I can admit that they were a bit heavy on the nerf hammer but that's what happens when everyone cries. Guess what's probably happening next? They're gonna nerf more survivors shit too. Too many people cry about shit instead of learning to effectively counter play.
---
can I get a Dwight too
---
gg ez tutorial is best response
---
Leave my boi alone ;-;
---
I'm waiting for bunny feng min
---
&gt; Pretty simple, just a button to select 4 random perks you own as your loadout, just for fun.
---
I'd like to believe this wouldn't be removed three days later when it's discovered that you can generate builds with perks you don't have, including those from the next DLC, by pressing L3 and switching to killer. (But only on Tuesdays.)
---
I was cleaning a totem with 1 generator left and as soon as it was 95% percent done, a generator popped. Turns out NOED had spawned on that totem and the killer Dc'd
---
Dude... I fucking love you &lt;3
---
I re-downed a Nea like three different times she'd wiggled free to get her to the hatch once.  
---
"You are going to your room whether you like it or not, ma'am!"
---
There needs to be punishments for disconnecting. This shit happens all the fucking time.
---
The hatch only spawns when all the gens are done? News to me!
---
Look how they massacred my boy
---
Because some of the changes are too much. But I do hate old legion.
---
All they needed to do was change Frank's mix tape and stop the men's from going down while in the terror radius. Every other change is bs. Maybe except the one where if he misses he comes out of frenzy. That one is fine as well.
---
I dont understand why i got 7 downvotes but yeah i mean i agree. I wasn't trying to say im godly or anything just saying idk if hes garbage or im good but i dont think i deserved downvotes :p
---
Lol yeah ok. Yeah, borrowed time got buffed because of literal camping and tunneling t that's become a huge issue. Guess what, if the game becomes too toxic for survivors... then you can play as your crybaby killer self. The maps....
---
Almost like your forget about the ones before that were heavily killer favored. Lol kid you're so biased you can't even think past the simple thought of "KiLlErS aRe GeTtInG nErFeD"
---
Your response completely missed the point what he said, that's because you are pretty much opposing what he says without realizing it.
---
This was console and was on controller lol
---
That‚Äôs what y‚Äôall get for using a key lmfao
---
Did i say that? The objective is to do gens yes. But only 2 need to be done for the hatch to spawn. So to be fair we were doing the objective. You must be a killer main due to how upset you sound lol
---
Damn
---
Unpopular opinion: I don't give a shit. Never played as him but played against him plenty of times and he was a massive cunt nugget
---
Have my upvote
---
&gt; Almost like your forget about the ones before that were heavily killer favored.
---
There has only been a single killer sided map, and they added tons of safe pallets to it and it no longer it. You are literally living in a fucking fantasy world
---
Yeah it rarely works ive just been 360ing like crazy since rank reset purple/red rank killers woulda never allowed this
---
I've been maining Jeff when I play Survivor but being able to play Les Claypool as Ace might make me switch.
---
That‚Äôs how I feel right now. I stopped playing five months ago. I‚Äôm thinking about picking it back up as I was a Leatherface main, but I‚Äôm nervous to be outmatched.
---
Na this is a controller big dawg
---
What about the other 3 survivors who also use MoM and aren't the obsession?
---
Congratulations, you played yourself
---
They were randoms. I didn't even know they brought one. So when I saw them waiting to find me I was like oh awesome.
---
Couldn't the same be said for legion? Against players who understand their power theyll just run away if they see a teammate get BT and happen to be in the terror radius. At least wraith gets 0 terror radius while stealthed and no limit to his faster movespeed, and if they choose to not heal Vs wraith they can easily find themselves being ambushed and downed without a real chase whereas Vs legion you'll hear the heartbeat and have a good idea of how close he is to you, line of sight or not.
---
Still no Bunny Feng, reeeeeee
---
I don‚Äôt give a shit either, people responding to my comments on here actually thinking this was me agreeing with or not agreeing with the nerf is great. I played as him just a handful of times but I know playing against him was a total pain in the ass. Was it overboard? Definitely, but at least I won‚Äôt have to deal with a 5 minute mend for now.
---
&gt;I think its ridiculous for people to think he's better or worse now considering the changes aren't even out.
---
I agree and once it gets on the ptb they could tweak legion more, because that is what testing is for..
---
"I only BM BM. " Yes that's called being part of the problem.
---
Yup thats solo queue life for ya. but i think they broke ruin and saved the guy on the hook so not completely useless teammates
---
Hmm. Doesn't sound like you did the objective if all the gens were not yet finished
---
In the PTB I will. And I'm gonna be on the forums discussing his power for sure. You know this isn't a set in stone update right? That's the why there's a mid chapter ptb. To flesh out hit power and everything else in this update
---
The crouch hides the terror radius, useful for counter rotating when there is a visible barrier or for tricking a survivor into thinking you left and making them heal. 
---
The ambush attach allows for quickly dashing around corners to make normally safe loops unsafe (Arditha uses it all the time even with low barriers by quick direction switching).
---
Removing the traps can only be done at specified locations, so you can go there to find likely already injured people or break away from a chase for a quick down. The traps also have a game ending consequence if you don‚Äôt remove them, making it a priority, but one survivors can adapt to, like 99ing gens.
---
Do we know what theyre gonna change?
---
I understand what you're trying to say, i rarely "tunnel" with legion too, but you have to realize that by doing this FF has little to no effectiveness, it will just be something that wastes 15 secs of survivors time (almost like a snap out of madness but with no skillchecks), and has no potential at all in downing somebody; now, following your example, after i put DW on somebody and then go find someone else 2 things can happen: if this 2nd surv i find is not injured, i will put DW on him too, and eventually (if i don't see glowing auras of other survs around him) i will need to down him to get a hook, and of course i will have to chase him with m1 in order to do this; 2nd case, the guy is already injured so it wouldn't make sense to use FF in the first place, i would just M1 him. But it's clear that you don't rly play legion and thus you don't understand the implications of such drastic changes and how they will affect the mechanics of his gameplay.
---
Fuck new and old legion. Take him out of the game please
---
Running around a tree or other thin object is actually smart against a low rank Leatherface if you can do it properly. Chances are he won't know how to turn properly with little experience and crash into it.
---
EVERYTHING in this game is fucking broken
---
Oof cant down people by mindless using frenzy to stab them 3 times and now has to actually play the game to win
---
This is truely a sad time
---
I don't want him to die. Just to have a reasonable power
---
The real "objective" as a survivor is to escape and do it in any way that you can. Doing gens is a big way to accomplish that, but if someone has a damn key then thats another way of escaping. Like I said, you must be a killer main.
---
I had played Leigon several times, maybe around 10 or more, but I soon stopped cos they are the most extreme killer with the lowest skill floor. They are broken with good addons but are shit without those. I can see why many Legion players resort to moonwalk but that is just disgusting. It's amazing how Behaviour could create such repulsive power.
---
Medium radius would be nice. Frank's mix tape needs a nerf and the double blade bug needs to be fixed then everything else isn't really a big problem. I always believe that Legion should get penalty for missing attack but putting them out of Frenzy seems a little bit too harsh, maybe decreasing their power gauge for each attack they miss would be better? It was also so hard to track down survivors every time I went to maps like Coldwind farm or Spirit's map as Legion. Not letting them see scratch marks and blood is just poking their eyes out. Overall the nerf is just too much. I was happy when I started reading it but as I scrolled down I just couldn't understand how Legion would be able to down people with their ability.
---
To be honest, I was looking forward to a rework. Now Behaviour is just going to nerf them to the ground like what they did to Freddy boy.
---
Pushing m2 also ends frenzy, conserving the powerbar. Faster than a missed attack would ü§î

You realize you can get your exhaustion to 1% (almost done), and then as long as you hold down shift, you can run around as much as you want. And if you want sprint burst, you just let go of shift for one second, and then you have it up?
---
It's honestly one of the best exhaustion perks in the game, but also one of the hardest to use properly.
---
Man that is some unlucky killer picks for you lol yeah i feel bad for people who spent money on legion. But i just wanna say, i play 50/50 each side but as a survivor, im not cheering because "yay easy games" im happy because now i dont have the chance of running into a killer that doesn't really have counterplay/fun to play against. I've never been a dc type of person so i put up with legion, now that i can happily join any lobby, that's what im happy for lol every time i see that deep wound at the bottom of the screen im like fuccccc i hope this is super boosted legion. Anybody that's halfway good is gonna land a free deep wound at least once a chase
---
okay buddy, please list all 30 of the things and I expect 30 things exactly.
---
They put keys in the game for a reason, you know that right?
---
No, wait, perfom a mori on them!
---
Personal opinion, Legion with franks mixtape was ok. Damn I wish it wasnt removed, while Nurse and billy is still a thing
---
what rank is this at?
---
The only ones whining were the survivor mains lol.
---
This community can't decide what the hell it wants.. that's the annoying part. People bitched *sooooo* hard
---
The game itself is good, but they've done so little with it. It's like the devs who first made the game and the people who own it now are different people. If they had talent they'd have shown it a little more than they have by now. Legion was designed years after the game came out, dozens of people at behavior approved of legion and though he was completely ok. They are all either idiots or just don't play their own game. How the fuck did the talented people who made the game design legion? They must literally not play their game. Or just give so little of a fuck that it just didn't matter.
---
Hmm interesting. Do you have any pamphlets or perhaps a mailing list I can join to learn more? I have been told that NOED is a bad game breaking crutch because it rewards killers for not killing everyone, even if they had been hooking people previously which is a way to accomplish the goal of killing people. Sounds very similar to what you just said. Interesting, I would love to flip through a pamphlet and see if there is a section on this
---
How? I don‚Äôt even remember Freddy getting huge changes, I just know he‚Äôs been annoying and bad
---
Okelidokeli neighorino

IDK how legion mains have so much fun playing him that you justify how unfun it is for survivors. I have never gotten an ounce of enjoyment from legions because it sucks. And everybody knows that. That's why I never have a 4 man against legion. Sometimes I'm on my own ffs. I've never disconnected because of a killer or playstyle I didn't like. But that was about to change after getting 3 legions in a row. 
---
Legion sucks ass right now. This update will make him bearable for the survivors. And it will most likely need to be rebalanced for the killers to have fun. Also his power isn't useless. It's the best tracking power in the game and slows the game down immensely. One thing they should do is change the mending time to be longer
---
She‚Äôs part of the collection with Miner Trapper
---
Be my guest. I don't care to be honest. I just wanted to share my experience and of course there has to be that one dickhead who spoils everything. This time it's you. Lmao not replying after this.
---
I want my money back for a legion. Its unplayable now
---
By the way, it is appreciated that BHVR is looking at the forums and Reddit. As much complaining as there is here, it is glad to know you listen. 
---
Didn‚Äôt even realize you worked for BHVR until after I posted.
---
Lmao, I got super bored during my waiting in lobbies, so I just kinda worked on it
---
Lmao ooof so I just suck, still congrats
---
this meme is sooo relatable
---
there's 2 killers in that lobby i bet
---
*Significant* difference. Means the killer can catch up faster and loops don't work for as long.
---
Clowns of The Day
---
You wouldn't think so but then you loop a hag or a huntress and it feels like they're never going to catch you
---
But...bunny feng....

oh god please don't do that reddit neckbeard shit

https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/57702/the-legion-update
---
animes and cartoons are a different thing entirely (category)
---
Pretty much, yeah.
---
I was mostly right :D
---
I never called you dumb. What you said is dumb.
---
Would be nice for them to slow down making content... 
---
"Yeah lets stop releasing content like we promised we would every 3 months and stop making money so we can pay all of our working teams cause some people cant handle a couple of minor bugs" - BHVR 
---
Is basically what you're asking.
---
Every bug you stated they are looking into and they are fixing as fast as they can no matter if its 2 weeks or 3 months.
---
Your problem is not that they are not being fixed, its that they are not being fixed fast enough for YOUR convenience. 
---
If you dislike bugs maybe you should stop playing games. Because there is no game out there that is flawless without bugs. You have to accept that no game is perfect and the devs are doing their best or stop playing it.
---
Thanks man! Just gotta practice. REMEMBER, your sticks have to face different directions (right stick in, left stick out), turning up your sensitivity helps, and timing is everything. Also this doesn't work on every body, usually not as good killers. Gl out there!
---
I honestly hope they do something outside of the changes listed and dont make this a pure nerf, like give mend longer to take or make allow blood tracking, cause i really like the concept and design of this killer and hope they dont make him freddy but worse
---
Not only that, but they swore they‚Äôd never race to nerf a killer into the ground before and explicitly claimed to have learned from Freddy. Obviously, that was bullshit too.
---
Wait so can we bring back Le Olde Toxic Legion then? Superb logic!
---
wait no shoot me that mailing list first
---
Okay
---
Wtf, like i expected a rework but not a complete Freddy nerf...
---
That's not true.
---
Yes, it does. 
---
Chasing with killers like the hag or spirit is noticeably worse than chasing with the trapper or the pig. The 5% change in speed allows for killers to be better able to perform mind-games around loops or close a gap during a chase much faster. 
---
If you want a good comparison, I would suggest trying to chase survivors using hag without her power &amp; compare it to chasing survivors with the pig. 
---
You will definitely notice a difference in chasing potential with both killers hence why the hag relies on her power to down survivors as opposed to the pig that relies on her chasing ability to down survivors.
---
I still consider freddy worse tbh but I reserve my judgement for PTB
---
Yea I saw it on the front, thanks anyway
---
you said I ignored the "30 really bad, non-sensible things", then tell me what those are, surely you have 30 of them, that is a very specific number to give in a reply.
---
Tbh i had an idea a while ago where your first hit was an automatic transition to frenzy instead of a normal m1, so you dont activate the power by choice its simply "you injured a survivor now youre in frenzy"
---
loved that guy so much no homo
---
I‚Äôm so glad I didn‚Äôt get cosmetics for him.
---
What was he like pre-nerf?
---
The changes aren't out yet. I'm just as displeased with the changes as you are, but we have to remember they aren't final. Let's just hope the test build shows that.
---
Mines is Qaydaddy
---
 Ut old legion was slow af before. Now atleast they can jog now, plus feral frenzy is overrated.
---
okay so we *are* going to do that reddit neckbeard shit where we pretend like we don't understand hyperbole and other very cool rhetorical devices, neat good stuff classic
---
Tbh i had an idea a while ago where your first hit was an automatic transition to frenzy instead of a normal m1, so you dont activate the power by choice its simply "you injured a survivor now youre in frenzy" (is replying to my own comment cause i had forgotten this till now)
---
Yeah haha
---
Great,  was scared  I would have to buy Leatherface just for BBQ
---
It's overall bad for the game if they just nerf Legion. They make up half of a chapter of which people have paid money for. Even if you dislike legion seeing the devs go the route of just making them worse shouldn't be the solution. A rework was needed, not nerf their power to shit and make them a standard M1 killer...
---
Too many huge nerfs all at once. Legion will be ruined with these changes and with that I plead:
---
1. Give me my bloodpoints back from 3 pretiges
---
2. Give me my refund on the Joey skin
---
3. Give me my refund on the Entire DLC
---
The thing is, we don't necessarily notice the bad or average SWF groups because they don't game the matchmaking through rank manipulation and run 3 Adrenalines, MoM, have a designated runner/flashlight clicker, etc. It's the optimal sweaty ones we typically dislike. If I have a feeling I'm going against one, I'll go on Spirit with a Mother Daughter Ring/Bloody Hair Brooch combo and typically take care of them, but I don't usually want to sweat like that. Most of the time I just want to chill and play as Clown or Leatherface or Freddy, etc. So I wouldn't mind a casual and ranked queue.
---
Some people jump at any occasions to trash the devs so it's expected.
---
I just hope the planned changes get tweaked a little bit because while some ideas are cool, some others are really dumb.
---
i think the reason why bbq hasnt been in the shrine much is because they lower the chances of getting perks from dlcs
---
I bought all the DLC (back when the latest one was The Pig) for ~¬£50 and have bought every DLC on release since. I have no regrets.
---
&gt; the mend timer stops when mending
---
&gt; the mend timer stop when in terror radius
---
????? Then what in the world does their power do????? So they either don‚Äôt have to worry about it bc my terror radius is keeping it from going down or they don‚Äôt have to worry about it bc the only time they‚Äôll have to mend is when they‚Äôre completely safe? 
---
Fuck! Rip legion dude, they were my main. I had so many fun games with them where I would mess around with the survivors. Guess I‚Äôll just go back to my piggy. She seems safe from the nerfs, for now...
---
I don't get it :/
---
Yeah, how ignorant. Cartoons are animations and anime is JAPANESE animation. Such a HUGE difference. /s
---
Yep, just wish Plague and Ash had been out when the sale happened
---
These changes are nuts but moonwalking did need a fix as well. Frank‚Äôs mixtape combos also tended to be a little bit silly. 
---
Base legion honestly wasn‚Äôt as bad in chases as made out to be. If you focus on breaking chases and hiding rather than looping he‚Äôs a lot easier to counter
---
anime is not specifically from japan it's a different art form (avatar is an anime by art form for example)
---
I think he just needs a rework. Even if they *just* adjusted the moonwalk cheese strat, people would still DC a lot against legion. In fact, I didn't run into Franks a lot, or at least with the moonwalking bit, but I would find myself DC'ing more often than not (which I am not a fan of doing), because I just didn't enjoy playing against him. I go between killer and survivor when I play, and I never once played legion, or bought the DLC because his power was lame. Sure some killers are annoying to me like Hag and Nurse, but, I still get some enjoyment playing against them, I never find myself DC'ing when facing them because I like to see if I can outplay them. Legion, you get stabbed, and play mending simulator which is so monotonous that I can't be bothered to play the game.
---
Wow... I legit bought cannibal last week. I knew this shit would happen.
---
For all survivors to use the hatch it does. For 3 people to escape you need to do 4.
---
I want to play legion now.
---
Sorry for the late reply, thanks for the info. It helped me a lot because I used this ingame yesterday and it turned out to be successful.
---
I really hope they just give him blood tracking still... i literally spent so many hours hating myself as wraith to get bloodhound and i liked using blood to find injured survivors (i didnt moonwalk like a cunt, i did a lot of hit and run so I'd naturally lose survivors without some form of tracking)
---
I don't want to start tunneling and being toxic and I shouldn't have to bring a gimmick perk that only works well on one or two killers. It's a bit like saying bring small game to counter noed.
---
The point is I won't know ahead of time if they are using metal of man. Remember the reason they nerfed decisive strike was because of four man swf groups using it together to stall the killer.  I don't see how this is any different.
---
I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO USE RUIN TO NOT HAVE MULTIPLE GENS POP IN THE TIME IT TAKES ME TO FIND ONE PERSON. I WAS ON THE SWAMP AND PARTWAY THROUGH MY INTIAL PARTOL I GET A GRAB OF A GENERATOR. GOOD START RIGHT! NO BECAUSE IN THE TIME IT TAKES ME TO HOOK HIM AND WALK 2 STEPS TWO GENS POP AND  I AM PRETTT FUCKING SCREWED BECAUSE I AM THE PIG AND SLOW AF. I WASN'T ABLE TO BUILD ANY MOMENTUM AND GOT STOMPED. I DON'T CARE ABOUT LOSING, I JUST WANT TO HAVE FUN AND NOT HAVE TO SWEAT.
---
*laughs in borrowed time*
---
While true, that was definitely more of a terrible connection problem lol. People dont just snap around the map and then magically teleport onto hooks...
---
So uhh, i live under a rock so i dont know about the changes. What happened to him?
---
I think it was Rank 7.
---
i personally dont find him that bad to go up against personally
---
:( but I didnt grabbed him because he has bbq and chilli. I grabbed leather face because he is fat and he squeals like a pig, but now that clown exists and has a bigger bulge, what does leatherface have now?
---
I‚Äôm not I just find legion useless now and it is makes me mad I spent money on him to never use him again but people where saying I‚Äôm a legion main for saying this but I play Myers mostly so that‚Äôs why I explained the reason I play reason
---
So you don't have enough "bad shit" to talk about the Legion changes before even playing with them to reply with, so instead you act like this. Good to know.
---
This community dumb.
---
After this I couldn't use R1 on anything and I walked straight through the exit gate to the edge of the map. Everyone else escaped but I had no choice other than to take the kill.
---
I just bought a nice new outfit for my handsome boy a few days ago...
---
I am ashamed that i have given someone the want to play legion
---
He's not being condescending, so I don't see why you have a problem with him. He's more along the lines of "Here's my educated guess based on how other, similar killers play."
---
[basically](https://pics.me.me/heres-a-solution-im-mad-i-dont-want-a-solution-33299816.png)
---
For the legion part, I get where you are coming at, but its not necessarily easy to run away from a terror radius if you dont know its is source considering my experience doing so with pre nerf legion. Now being able to cover more ground means he might be able to stab more easier especially since he can chain his power from survivor to survivor; however this is still speculation, the buff to the distance covered by his power might not mean anything at all.
---
As for Wraith, I entirely disagree. Wraith is pretty easy to spot when he is cloacked, using it as a stealth tool doesnt do much since he has to uncloack, usually giving enough time to reach a loop. Using it as a tool to cover distance, sure nice for reaching the survivor you found by bbq, but doesnt do much in a chase since the distance  covered is entirely nullified by the time it takes to uncloack.
---
i mean, tbf normal speed AND a third blink do seem kind of OP, they should have done away with the blink but kept her normal speed.
---
*DC noise intensifies*
---
The only people upset are legion mains. One day they'll realize they were playing a bullshit character with no counterplay that has OP addons and bullshit tactics you can use. That being said, they didn't need to burn legion into the ground lol
---
If they added blood pools and let us see deep wounds, then i think I'd be 100% fine with this rework
---
he was flawed, yes absolutely.
---
But this, the right choice? Obviously not.....
---
Kinda makes his power useless now. If he can't hit you twice and deep wounds doesn't go down in your terror radius you might as well never use his power
---
And then you die because of blood warden
---
This is good to hear. When you go against infinite mend timer, you'll understand.
---
Your in luck its finally here as damage control lol!
---
Oh no buddy they absolutely deserve every ounce of hate. They gutted our boy. He's basically Freddy after the 1st hit. Then they lessened his speed. Why? Why? He cant down you with it. and if Billy can traverse at 230% with no recharge or limit to duration with a lethal attack why hell cant Legion move at 120% with an attack that cannot down people for a limited amount of time.
---
I dont like to advocate for DC'ing, but this map I DC on a good 90% as killer. Auras and scratch Mark's literally dont exist lol so I'd rather roll the dice and get another map I can at least play the game on.
---
Hmm fascinating. I'm learning a lot and taking rigorous notes
---
Survivors can no longer fall asleep when facing The Nightmare.
---
No offense, but are you old enough to be playing this game? I understand some people suck at art, but I‚Äôd be concerned if my child was exposed to this game.
---
- Worried Stranger
---
Lmao ‚Äútutorial‚Äù that‚Äôs new to me. I love it
---
That would be shitty anyway.
---
The only way I see Legion being viable at this point is if he gets lots of add-ons that dramatically extend mend time. The obvious intent is for mend to become a serious time waster, which doesn‚Äôt work since it takes five seconds to mend.

do u have a mailing list i can join to learn more each week about all the other rhetorical devices u pretend to not understand thanks
---
Going to put all my bloodpoints towards an impossible skillcheck doctor. Screw all of the people who wanted legion nerfed into the ground. Wasted 7 euros and millions of bloodpoints on prestige 3 level 50 legion. This calls for blood.
---
Wow would you look at that. Bitching about a 'meh' killer made him even more 'meh'. Thank you dbd Community very cool.
---
Freddy rework is gonna be Freddy cant sleep people while they are in his lullaby radius. Im calling it now
---
I use it as a way of baiting the killer in and vanishing. When it works, it is a lot of fun.
---
They‚Äôre a new killer? The shit? Really need to get back in this community
---
No fuck legion still lmao.
---
What's the difference of calling someone or something they say dumb? Either way ur still disrespecting the person.
---
And yes slowing down would help them by NOT adding even more bugs on top of the ones they have yet to fix. THATS what I'm saying, I'm not "basically" asking them anything, that's the same as putting words in my mouth. Asking them to slow down and asking them to stop releasing content is very different. Plus what's the difference between waiting another month for new content? It's not like they don't already make enough by the already made content to pay their employees and that's not considering that it's going to be a switch game soon which will bring in even more money. They aren't a big company at all so it should take so much money where they should have to make content every three months to keep their employees happy. 
---
And it's not just me, a ton of ppl are complaining about the bugs and threatening to stop playing because of them, u really call those bugs "minor"?
---
So don't give me that "YOUR convenience" crap.
---
It's not that I dislike bugs but me along with several other ppl get tired of experiencing the same bugs repeatedly on a daily basis even if we love the game. I do realize they are doing their best but this game has been out for a while so they should have enough experience to fix them a little quicker than they used to that's common sense.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFtfDK39ZhI watch this to see where i (and others) are coming from
---
But you need to do the objective (doing gens) in order for it to spawn?
---
Also the hatch can reward one or two survivors for having to do everything in a game with shite teammates.
---
It has its flaws but it‚Äôs not that problematic.
---
I can comfortably say that this doesn‚Äôt make me even remotely forgive them.
---
yeah i could see that
---
legion base movement speed is increased but hey fair enough opinion
---
Well nurse is a shit killer so they had to face camp for kills, obviously.

DBD is great but it must have one of the least QoL features I have seen in an online game.

Old Legion is awful game design. Now new legion is simply a 115 killer with a power that lets him get the first hit. If you all thought Clown was boring to play, think about how much fun New Legion will be to play.
---
Maybe BHVR shouldn‚Äôt have half assed a killer‚Äôs mechanics in order to sell cosmetics and this problem wouldnt have happened in the first place.
---
For context, this was my first killer game after rank reset. They did no gens and just hid in obvious corners all the time.
---
So um where's Bunny Feng Min?
---
Exactly that's what i've been saying. Like yeah we all wanted a rework but they obviously don't have time for that at the moment
---
But you don't have to complete the objective? I get told all the time that NOED is wrong because it helps killers complete the objective without deserving to so this is all very interesting and I'm learning a lot very new player btw

The Chapter's almost been out for a month now. The hype for the chapter is dead now by the time they drop it will have lost its appeal :(
---
You probably had bad ping, he was reacting very late to your double backs and ran into the shack window for like 3 seconds before going over. I'd leave for a better killer without shit ping too.
---
PLEASE BHVR FIX THINGS FASTER AND PUNISH DCS MORE, I CAN'T HANDLE PLAYING ALL THESE SHITTY 3V1S OR PLAYING WITH ALL THESE FUCKING RANDOM DCS AND SURVIVORS WHO THINK THEY SHOULD DC IF I FIND THEM QUICKLY OR IF I'M PLAYING A KILLER THEY DON'T LIKE. THIS IS SO FUCKING ANNOYING, I JUST WANT TO PLAY VIDEO GAMES GOD DAMNIT
---
Op thinks he's a good because he looped a rank 18 huntress
---
Clown of The Day
---
WHY DOES ALL THESE IDIOT SURVIVORS HAVE TO DC WHY GET TUNNELED EVEN WHEN THE KILLER HAS STACKED UP THERE M.O.M LIKE WTF!!!!!!!!!
---
Lisa is the worst character in the show. Fuck the OP, fuck Lisa, and fuck his bitch-ass opinion.
---
I agree that Legion needs penalty for missing an attack but putting them out of Frenzy seems a little bit harsh. I thought maybe decreasing their power gauge for each attack they missed would be great as 360 wouldn't hurt them too and they can't spam M1 brainlessly anymore. But not allowing them to see blood is unreasonable to me. Yeah, Legion can still get people injured easily but after the first hit they will have to chase like a normal killer without any help to counter loops. You can't mind game at safe windows/pallets unless the survivor is really really dumb. We just have to wait when the public test is out and see how it will be.
---
There was no update yesterday
---
Literally your username?? Please come @me on your main account
---
Duration &lt; Speed 
---
Its still bottom line a nerf.
---
In a game where every second counts making it take longer to do the exact same thing is a nerf.
---
Yeah, I subscribe t howtodealwithpretentiouspeople@gmail.com (they're looking for a shorter handle)
---
Stealth can counter nurse. I want her reworked or at least her "omega" combination because it is stupidly powerful.
---
Did you seriously make an account just to post this?
---
I know, but for just a simple vault duration is better. It has pros and cons.
---
sweet looking forward to it nice
---
Definitely! But i think they're going to do a good job. Plague has given me a lot of faith. Very fun killer. I think they will be able to do something that's not only fun and balanced, but holds true to the license. Personally i feel like his current state already makes you feel like freddy from the movies. I hope it still feels that way
---
&gt;I don't want to start tunneling and being toxic
---
Then don't complain when you don't get any kills
---
&gt;I shouldn't have to bring a gimmick perk that only works well on one or two killers
---
I use MyC on Plague because I don't have any good perks, and it works pretty well. It obviously works better on someone like Wraith, but don't completely forget about it because your playing a normal killer
---
Also, if you would bring Franklin's to deal with items, why not use MyC or Haunted to deal with MoMs
---
I also forgot to mention that Remember Me plays perfectly into MoM since it gives you an extra hit
---
&gt;Remember the reason they nerfed decisive strike was because of four man swf groups using it together to stall the killer
---
The reason BHVR nerfed it or the reason it needed nerfed? Because this was definitely scummy, but the reason it needed nerfed was because it had 0 counter play, 0 downside and 0 criteria, the 4 man swfs only added to that. 
---
If BHVR wanted to nerf Dstrike specifically because of swfs, all they had to do was make it obsession only, with a severe downside, or being completely unable to be used if your not the obsession.
---
Stealth can counter nurse 
---
Legion tho them cant see scrach marks when on ff
---
Have ever said that they're 100% randomly generated?
---
For anyone wondering the sauce is JoJo‚Äôs Bizarre Adventure Vento Aureo (aka Golden Wind aka part 5) episode 22 ‚ÄúThe G in Guts‚Äù
---
Might as well lump in a great huntress.
---
It‚Äôs on shrine oh no better get there fast af
---
Oh alright, I for some reason thought you meant "slower" in general. His base MS is 115% and he does slow down while charging.
---
THIS IS WHY YOU RUN NOED. IF THEY DON'T LIKE IT THEY SHOULD TAKE SOME TIME TO CLEANSE TOTEMS
---
From a meme, to my half assed replies to me straight up not taking any of this seriously - thank you for the paragraph, I love it
---
Ah right on, on ps4 huntress is hard as he'll to play
---
Completely agree with the significant reduction in movement speed. 
---
One of the biggest issues with Legion that made him bad originally was that without add-ons, he could never reach survivors to hit with frenzy which would force him to tunnel the first survivor he found. 
---
Unless the duration is increased significantly, the chances of Legion hitting more than one survivor is negligible meaning his power loses all its point. This combined with deep wound not going down while in a killers terror radius means that Legion is just a base 115% movement speed killer with the ability to injure someone for free &amp; that's it. 
---
It's so bland &amp; tasteless that it's painful to see a killer with such an interesting aesthetic be screwed over by BHVR because they are too lazy to rework his power to something more interesting but would rather go full on overkill on nerfs to a killer that was already one of the weakest in the rooster.
---
Adding insult to injury is the whole borrowed time nerf. Survivors won't feel compelled to mend themselves against large terror radius killers &amp; do not have to worry about finding a safe spot to mend as if the killer even looks in their direction the deep wound state does not go down. This just hurts all the killers for no reason.
---
To be fair, a lot of people felt Legion was a mess to begin with. If BHVR themself knew it as well even before MAKING the character, surely thats a red flag. But I appreciate the idea that they are trying to do their best shot at making it fun for both sides.
---
I mean you could have at least named one dude....
---
FUCK NOED AND PEOPLE WHO DC AFTER BEING DOWNED ONE TIME.
---
Meanwhile sitting here happy I don't have to dc legion games, anymore cause playing against him doesn't feel like ass now
---
I might become a Legion main because I enjoy playing the trashy characters and trying to destroy people with them.
---
Had a survivor syringe tech me and then get trapped right after. Let me tell you I have never seen a man DC so god damn fast after getting trapped.
---
LOOK AT THE LOADING BAR. IF IT STOPS FOR A SUSPICIOUS AMOUT OF TIME IT'S GONNA BE A 3V1

AND WITH SOME PRACTICE YOU'LL BE ABLE TO TELL EVERY SINGLE TIME. 
---
JUST CTRL SHIFT ESC AT THE LOADING SCREEN AND YOU'RE GONNA LOSE IS YOUR OFFERING.
---
HAVEN'T HAD A 3V1 IN AGES, TRUST ME ON THIS ONE
---
I really would have been happy to but I'm not going to engage with that bad faith shit.
---
Missing one attack and having your entire power bar drained and suffering from a stun. That's ridiculous and overboard
---
Wraith uses stealth to get easier M1 hits.  Legion uses their agility to get easier M1 hits.  After that, both of their powers become useless while in pursuit.  At least Spirit can use her power to down people shes chasing.
---
which exploit?
---
the moonwalking exploit?
---
the mending addon exploit?
---
or the spamming m1 to gain distance exploit?
---
Before I found this post, I told my friend about the changes and imagined this meme in my head...

I'M AWARE THAT THE LOADING BAR FORESHADOWS A 3V1, THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT ANY LESS TRIGGERING. I JUST WANT TO PLAY THE GAME.
---
&gt; like give mend longer to take
---
Terrible idea. Having to mend all the fucking time was the worst part of Legion
---
? I mean Meg and Trapper share a
---
banner, they arent with Billy and Ace
---
~Fucking survivor mains~ 
---
This is gold.
---
My favorite part is that Nea appears with the killers in one shot.
---
How do you do it on PC?
---
Ok, cool, thanks for the full answer!
---
The only thing I have to worry about that is, the other "first hit" m1 killers are mid to low tier, and they don't have a stun that stops them from doing anything (other than Nurse, but her blinks completely change the equation). Unfortunately, unless Deep Wounds takes a long time to fix (almost a full health state), there's no point in applying it to survivors, especially since it does not tick down in TR. The way these changes are written, it feels rather toothless. 
---
I'm sure you know everything I'm about to say, but if you'll indulge me for a second, I'd like to point a few things out
---
Pig's RBTs work because even though searching a box doesn't take any longer than the current deep wound timer, the survivor has to waste time going to a box first. And if that box isn't the correct one, they have to do it again. All while the timer counts down if a generator is completed, unless they are actively in a chase. The survivor would have no reason to do this immediately in most circumstances, as it does not stop them from doing gens, but the RBT itself is rather loud, making it easier for the killer to find you if it's on your head.
---
Doctor's Madness works because even though it only takes the 12 seconds, and you don't have to go anywhere to do it, the survivor doesn't completely nullify Dr's power after it's completed. They're still in tier 2 madness afterwards. They share in hallucinations, and they get the funky skill checks. The survivor has to do this as soon as possible since it stops them from being able to do generators.
---
Deep Wounds, as it currently stands, does neither of these things. There is no real pressure on a survivor to stop what they're doing so they can get Deep Wounds off them. If they are not the last survivor Legion sees with Frenzy, they have an unlimited amount of time to complete whatever action they were doing if the survivor looping Legion is anywhere near them, and then an additional 20 seconds or so to stop what they're doing and mend, since the timer stops when you're mending. Especially now that Legion can't interact with the Deep Wounds timer at all, it's very difficult to put any meaningful pressure on the survivors.
---
Add on top of that the fact that since he has a 32m TR now, and it will be difficult to find a scenario where you're close enough to multiple survivors to actually make use of the fact that you *can* apply it to multiple people.
---
Legion definitely needed a change, even as a killer player. He wasn't fun to play against. But I don't think this was a good way to do it
---
As others have said, it's huge. Killer hitboxes interact with objects differently than survivor hitboxes, so 5% can turn a simple rock into an infinite loop.
---
Schrodinger's Dwight, he is both in the locker and not simultaneously.
---
The best feeling as Trapper when someone t bags you over a vault only to get snapped and you just stand there for a few seconds and you know they can hear you laughing your ass off.
---
We haven't even played him yet. Let's just wait.
---
No offense but I don't feel like you've played much wraith, generally speaking you should be able to get an early first hit if you utilizing the sprint lunge (the speed boost multiplies lunge distance considerably, if they aren't running sprint burst you should get a hit as well as being able to use it as a mind game at unsafe pallets) and similar to Myers you shouldn't be approaching gens from angles survivors are likely to be watching. As for the legion bit with them reducing the speed of feral frenzy it doesn't really matter that you're in it longer as they'll still be able to build up more distance because you're slower.
---
Even without the moonwalking exploit it was still a bullshit killer. Just keeps stabbing you for free until you go down with no counter play
---
*Can we nerf Autodidact next? It completely ruins the healing nerfs and destroys Sloppy Butcher. :((*
---
ist pretty obvious that those changes are way too extreme....they should Start with a few small ones and wait for feedback
---
This should be so much more easier to achieve now.
---
Absolutely love this 10/10 will watch multiple times
---
You go try to finish 3 gens in a 1v1. Let me know when you succeed. I'm sure I'll be waiting a while...
---
This.
---
I think Suzies are the dumbest ones, they fall for really basic shit.
---
If you're gonna say something stupid don't be surprised if someone calls you out on it. 
---
I'm not just gonna stay quiet when someone says something dumb just cause your feelings might get hurt.
---
You're just acting entitled end expecting everyone to "respect" you when you're basically "disrespecting" the devs.
---
And that's hypocrisy at its finest. 
---
News flash they know they have bugs and there will ALWAYS be new bugs even when they solve the old ones with OR without DLCs. The disconnect bug was not caused by the Plague DLC is it? you disconnect regardless if its a plague in the match or not. It was caused by a completely different rework in the program, so saying they should slow down the content makes completely no sense and is irrelevant to the problem.
---
I like how you acknowledge they are not a big company and yet you're still asking them for more than they can do. They are doing the best they can with the little they have. If you're "getting tired of experiencing the same bugs" then take your 5$  that you maybe give them every 3 months for a DLC and go find another game.
---
they can nerf it some more for all i care
---
What's the console analogy you used?
---
People hated Legion bc of the exploit, you could deep wounds someone, get out of the chase, follow them with scratch marks or blood on the ground and down then without trouble. Fix that and all would be fine. They made feral frenzy useless.
---
Yeah I agree with this. 
---
People really act like they changed two or three things.
---
You don't have to be a rude cunt to me, I'm just stating facts. Doing all gens, or 4 gens, is definitely doing the objective enough to deserve a hatch.
---
lmfao is the post showing a 1 v 1 match? No? Then FuckOff, snowflake
---
I believe it's t make you actually think ahead and pay attention when attacking rather than just mindlessly swinging. We'll have to see how that plays out in the PTB.
---
This is the single reason why that one change they mentioned in the re-work should not go through. The change where if you miss an attack during a frenzy your frenzy bar gets immediately drained and you come out of Frenzy. 
---
Now, with the reduced speed of frenzy you might get a little more accuracy, but for those 180's and 360's There will be 0 point going into frenzy as Legion.
---
Fat Freddy Sharpfingers, head of the mafia.
---
I mean if there isn‚Äôt any hope for the survivors to escape the trial you might aswell rage quit. Hatch is imo a pretty important to prevent that.
---
Hmm. Okay. I guess two hooking everyone and using NOED to get those last hooks is the same then, thanks! May I cite you in my academic paper?
---
You got a laugh out of me.
---
Have an upvote.
---
Lol it does seem like that, but that's just because they're the only ones upset enough to talk about it.
---
Idk if they're too extreme because we haven't seen him yet. I personally don't feel like it will be that bad. His power still guarantees an easy first hit, then all you have to do is get 1 more hit in which shouldn't be difficult now that he is 115%. I could be wrong though, he might turn out to be garbage, I'm more so just happy that moonwalking won't be a thing anymore.
---
Where did you see that part about draining the power and stun? All I see on the announcement is:
---
&gt;Feral Frenzy is immediately and automatically cancelled whenever The Legion¬†misses an attack¬†while in frenzy.
---
That's basically how The Spirits power works.
---
Exactly how i saw it lmao thank you üòÇ
---
Dance with me and Lithe is by far my favorite combo in the game. Literally can't play without it, the jukes you can do are incredible.
---
I used to run quick and quiet and time it with the jump so it came up right after and get into a locker right after with no sound or marks, hilarious.
---
A developer confirmed in the official post stickied at the top of the subreddit
---
Are you assuming people thing getting 2 kills before the gens are done and then geting 2 more in the end game is broken? Your a pretty funny dude.
---
No? So hitting someone is Frenzy and then moonwalking so the timer kept going down while you were actually chasing the survivor isn't OP?
---
Are we talking about the hatch or about the key? Also, I'm curious as to what your thoughts are on moris are
---
https://np.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bdx86v/the_legion_update/el1opf9/

I'm with you on that

I like legion when he came out, then he got cheesy and boring
---
I'm gonna play him after this patch I guarantee you that
---
Imagine unironically acting like a little bitch to strangers online.
---
Huff sixteen moist Taco Bell sulfur farts.
---
the key. why the fuck would it simply be the hatch?
---
ebony moris need to be cancelled from the game

Saw those couple weeks back thought they were silver lol

But freddy used remember me

I find plague super fun to play against and as, I think they will do well with Freddy. Legion was a downer but my post is my point.

there fixed ur post
---
Noooooo this is the exact reason why this is tied for the most important change they made! It takes 0 skill to press RT 5 times and finally land it. A 6 year old can land a FF hit after 5 trys. I ALWAYS 360 legions 2+ times just to end up having to mend any way. That's a huge part of the no counter play aspect of legion. I should not get punished even though i outplayed/out-moved him a few times. Thats why my title is the only time i escaped deep wound. Because i always make legions miss but very very very very rarely do i actually get to leave a chase without mending
---
&gt;I find it really strange that you are referring to not bleeding out in TR as to something bad. That was a major issue with Legion
---
I'm not sure what to make of this statement. A "major issue" with Legion is that his power was useless without moonwalking. Now his power is just useless. When people wanted the devs to fix him, they didn't mean turn him into a 115% speed M1 killer.

---
I never see these posts on this sub. And I personally think it's the biggest problem facing the game right now. It's way too easy and has no penalties. So many matches are ruined by purposeful dcs. 
---
There are other issues surrounding it like a player unable to load before the match, so they have to alt F4. Then it's a 3 v 1 so then another player says screw this and purposefully leaves.
---
Ignoring that situation I still think players D/Cing needs to be addressed. I think if they fix the infite load problem players would still be leaving matches around the same rate.
---
The situation is essentially just childish toxic players who don't want to play against another Legion or 3 blink nurse. Or killers who can't handle being outplayed. It needs to be punished. Either play the game or don't. And it's gotten bad enough that devs need to punish the players who decide to quit mid match. Much like a misbehaving child, give them a timeout.
---
As long as the devs can decipher a legit crash (because it does happen) from someone hitting quit or just alt f4ing they should hand out time outs. For first time offenders a few minutes, for repeats, just keep increasing the time. It shouldn't be tolerated it ruins the game for everyone.
---
If you are a person who disconnects.. Grow up.
---
The thing with 110 killers is that their power generally helps them in a chase. If you don't have that on your 110 killer, you're not going to get very far because you then have to rely on regular M1s.
---
"rest of the playerbase" is basically that those players main both killer and survivor
---
Ah gotcha so all it does is allow you to see the white/orange/red  aura?
---
* Extra slowdown when using the power on a survivor 
---
* increased terror radius
---
* nerfed addons 
---
* allowing survivors to wake up automatically when downed but healed back up
---
* increasing his lullaby radius for awake survivors. 
---
Freddy with an 8 meter lullaby was actually terrifying, he could pop up anywhere
---
Like how Urban, Decisive, Self-Care, etc. aren't crutch perks?
---
Players wanted a full rework, not a disabled character.
---
Agreed. Just gonna have to wait and see what happens. I think this game has a big year ahead of it but we shall see
---
Darn
---
They made changes so that people will use his power as it was designed (hitting multiple survivors, making them mend to keep them off gens) rather than how it was commonly used (tunnel a single survivor into the earth with no ability for them to counterplay)
---
This is a bullshit argument and you know it. The requirements to get BP stacks are totally different. If they re-worked how WGLF attained stacks it would absolutely be used a lot. It has nothing to do with aura reading. If you want a strong aura reading perk you use Bitter Murmur
---
I don't agree with you, and I'd say more than that - Legion was useless without his power. And his power was pretty much just initiating a guaranteed hit ability 4-2 times. That what was a global issue with him, moonwalking was just one another of his issues (and it should be fixed now).
---
Actually, I was saying exactly that - that 115% speed M1 killer would be better, than his initial state. And I wasn't the only one who was saying that btw, I think I heard the same from Scott Jund for example.
---
It was shitty design, but shitty design doesn't make something overpowered. Legion is universally considered among the worst killers.
---
I am play survivor and killer and it is always fun to see survivor and killer mains complain about each other when it is obvious they never played the opposite side.
---
It's completely pointless. All it is for is to help get the first hit and that's it. If the survivor is injured, your power is entirely useless. If you leave the survivor they will have a while before their bar goes down from leaving you TR. Not to mention the DW bar pauses now while mending.
---
They will appear to have the same problem they have now, if you choose to try and snowball by hitting everyone, only the last survivor you start regularly chasing is in danger, DWs will be minimal threat to everyone else. If you choose to tunnel, it at least won't feel uncounterable, but you're basically like a standard chase killer with NO tools to help you down the survivor faster.
---
It's sad that I consider the legion we have now in a better place than what they're getting nerfed into.
---
You've hit multiple nails on the head there. Thanks for your comment. I really hope they will improve this game for the better.
---
Hitting through pallets is intended you nerd
---
I don't see anything about the power bar draining. But I also can't see what comment they're responding too in your link.
---
This is actually a really good idea. I'm not sure how painful it is on PC to go against a nurse of PC but I'm a nurse main on PS4 and more of my hits are from lunges rather than swings. I think this would be a small change that would make a big difference
---
Moonwalking
---
Hit the parent button under the comment
---
have you never played Legion? when your power depletes you get a stun
---
The game is really starting to suffer from it. And even some Fog Whispers do it.
---
I always loved Legion
---
Did you forget to switch accounts? Lol
---
Lmao nerf or nothing perfect description for this situation
---
Stalking in tier 3 only helps you locate any survivors out in the open. It‚Äôs not really useful for anything else.
---
not too different. Adrenaline wouldn't wake you up, smaller terror, no stun for when you put in dream. don't remember what else they changed.
---
Shamelessly stolen from u/SyxxGod
---
Do they even ban on consoles?
---
Not really I‚Äôve tried both and she‚Äôs harder on pc
---
It's just frustrating because posts like this usually get lost in a tide of down-votes. Where do these down-votes come from? The toxic players who purposefully DC.
---
You can play a lot and not be any good. You still grind BP even if you die every round.
---
Now this is a good meme
---
You're exactly right, you will have to M1 to chase and down/hook survivors. This is how majority of the other killers play, and it creates opportunities for survivors to attempt counter play. His FF becomes crowd and tempo control, which is more appealing to me than quickly tunneling and downing a survivor a la plague with effective-boosted vomiting (I like Plague but she is also grossly unbalanced in this regard- it is not fun gameplay for survs to be downed in 3 seconds with no way to react). You could also potentially still use it for mobility and positioning purposes, closing distance and then catching up for M1 after the stun of ending FF.
---
Yes, this significantly nerfs Legion's ability overall, which I still think was much needed. It required no real game knowledge or strategy. We also still don't know how the add-ons will impact the new legion, either, so it's somewhat pointless to keep assuming NOBODY will play Legion anymore (not saying you specifically are doing this, just people in general) before we all get a chance to try it out.
---
nah man I mained nurse for while and if I'd been given 110 or even 115 in nurse's current state I'd have stopped playing her out of sheer guilt.
---
nurse is perfectly fine with 96.25 ms.
---
I would even suggest increasing her post blink fatigue just a little bit.
---
If I may, what should the power be then?
---
I just bought him a lovely new outfit...
---
Sure, you may like going around and stabbing people, but it's sure isn't fun being like "welp, I guess I'm getting hit no matter what I do". Imagine feeling powerless as survivor, no matter how good you are. That is not fun.
---
I honestly would. It will be nice to have whenever you choose to play killer
---
Yes, it is like the top tier top tier killer perk, it and ruin are almost mandatory at the higher ranks
---
They‚Äôre probably running Dead Hard and not Sprint Burst. Dead Hard lets you boost forward a bit when you‚Äôre injured and you become invulnerable for a couple seconds so they can‚Äôt be hit when activated
---
i don‚Äôt know why people hate it, it lets you heal yourself (1 perk, no item which means you can carry a toolbox or something)
---
Because people like playing with their friends that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs allowed
---
ty!
---
ok ty!
---
as a survivor main,i agree that those are some drastic changes.
---
New players?
---
dude what
---
That's more Toxic than Cyanide
---
So nobody wanting to use Legion's power and hence making him an M1 killer and having no actual individuality will somehow improve his overall gameplay in your eyes
---
He isn't fat he is T H I C C
---
They said "significantly" usually that means a huge difference 50-80% in BHVR world.
---
Kinda. 
---
We're pretty sure it's a connection thing. On the survivors screen, they start running, but you don't *quite* register it on your screen till you've already swung at them. 
---
I'm curious to see how it interacts after we get dedicated servers
---
Can I have that Legion pic? The crying one.
---
i know the difference between Dead Hard and Sprint Burst and i was robbed of my hit BY Sprint Burst as they weren't injured, it's especially painful when you are Nurse.
---
but eh whatever, i'll figure this out somehow
---
No, I'm pretty sure literally every single person who has ever or will ever played this game is playing how they want. I don't believe that's exclusive to you.
---
THE GREAT SKILL CHECK BAR IS SO TINY
---
BBQ basically cuts the DBD grind in half with a nice aura reading as a bonus.
---
No DONT make mending longer. Remove deep wound and redesign his power.
---
Can't see it on Bacon Reader, sorry.
---
If you don‚Äôt have the leather face dlc but have enough iri shards then I would get it forsure
---
Yes, sprint burst is fast enough that if you are close and swing you wont hit them as they run off. Some survivors try to be disrespectful and wait as long as possible to run off to get the killer to wiff.
---
So here‚Äôs a little background to what happen, we were playing against a doctor with high terror radius and was also running bbq &amp; chili. I was playing Claudette (I run lithe, self healing, dance with me, and urban evasion). I‚Äôm not toxic at all, I don‚Äôt teabag, I don‚Äôt point, I‚Äôm not even good at stunning killers with pallets tbh. This killer downed me (he did not hook me even though it was my last hook)  then went after the other survivor (we were the last two left). The other survivor managed to heal me and died shortly afterwards. The killer found the hatch before me and decided to camp it. A minute after I find it and him, he sends me this message lol. He actually did disconnect and got zero points. I still got my progress and my points so I‚Äôm not sure why he even did that lol
---
Hold up. What? Les Claypool?
---
I will get it then ty!
---
did you end up reporting him, since you have solid proof it was a purposeful disconnect?
---
Haha nice impact font
---
If you play Michael alot you know the signs when you've got a survivor in your sights ( slowed movement , screen distortion etc) so it can also help you know when a survivor is hiding but like the tip of their head is visible.. you may not see it but the stalk will still happen. I like to do a little spin when I know someone is hiding around me
---
Bro have you missed the patch notes or something 
---
they took away his ability to see blood stains making what little tracking he had in his ff mode a big fat 0
---
they made it where if you get 360'd or just miss a hit in general the whole mode shuts down
---
They made it where your bar has to be full which means you miss that one hit it's fuck you
---
They made his ff basically useless by taking it's ability to down people n yes that makes him a basic M1 killer but most M1 killers have abilities that would help you down people like trapper or at least give you the element of surprise like wraith
---
now he just give you the deep wounds affect and that's it you mend and go about your day 
---
i think the nerf was a bit too much even though i hated him they didn't have to do him like that
---
Ace's Spring cosmetic set is very reminiscent of some of the whimsical outfits Claypool has worn over the years, to me.
---
For one, what rule is being broken? BHVR's stance has always been that survivors are NOT a team, and sandbagging/selling out your team in an attempt to survive is completely legit. It's also basically what Dwight is doing by hiding in the locker instead of contributing. 
---
Two, if survivors are rewarded with hatch for hiding all game while the other survivors die, what do they learn? They learn to be useless every other match as well. I'm 100% on board with selling out useless survivors to escape, it's the only time sandbagging another is appropriate, IMO.
---
That's what I'm hoping for!
---
Of course, It's going to take even good nurses to adapt, but if this were to happen, and you were to meet a Nurse with the same killing potential as before, you'd know that they were really skilled at her.
---
&gt; was also running bbq &amp; chili
---
er okay?
---
i had a couple games where it bugged out like that too, although it wasn't thrill of the hunt, but ruin or huntress lullaby, i could tell that i was cursed but it never showed the notification for it
---
Now play Quiet's theme song during the slow-mo bit.
---
Have you ever gone against a legion that whiffs 5 stabs in a row and still has enough power to get a lucky hit on you and then stab you again? This is exactly the reason he was nerfed and some other reasons as well as
---

My metal Jeff is so ready. Give it now.

I couldn't care less how you feel, just here to say my opinion, peace!

Bunny Freddy
---
Down vote me for speaking the truth, the fact that yall are upset over legion now being less spammy is so fucking funny
---
What rest of the playerbase?
---
One of the few memers I found legitimately funny, I should have backed up my favourites when he first went AWOL two months ago.. Ugh..
---
I'm gonna just keep on saying it: charge 10k BP to disconnect via the menu. 
---
People have no problem DCing early because they literally lose nothing. Make them eat the BP, or close and relaunch the app and the DC rate will be drastically reduced.
---
Definitely exploiting the mending bug, report him
---
Survivors need to mend and heal. Previously you didn't heal because Legion couldn't engage well without his Frenzy but now with 115% speed it will be more risky to stay injured.
---
Christ I hate that, I've found out that you can bait them to jump into the hatch with the plague if you have both cooldown add on as they think they can do it before you get control back it's the best feeling catching them off guard
---
I GOT BANNED ON PS4 AFTER I LOOPED A KILLER FOR 5 MINUTES THEN HE MESSAGED ME SO I TOLD HIM STFU AND HE REPORTED IT FOR OFFENSIVE LANGUAGE.
---
Fair enough, teleporting around is cool i guess. Imma rather stay tall though and hope for a chainsaw.
---
it wouldn't let you walk back through the gate to escape? that's so fucking weird.
---
from what i understand, glitches like this usually happen when two animations happen at the same time - i wonder if it was because you were trying to get out of the locker at the same time she pulled you out of it? super fucking weird.
---
and then she hard-camped you, yikes ü§£
---
Nobody asked for a slaughter, they asked for balance and a rework... 
---
Nice memes though
---
I'd rather have this trash than the other nonsense we've had for the past few months.
---
Matchmaking is busted.. completely unfair for those ranks to go against you..
---
Killers used to leave lobbies when they could tell it was a SWF lol. That‚Äôs why they changed how joining lobbies work so now you can‚Äôt tell.
---
Yes, was I not clear about that? That is what I said. It now requires a skill I don‚Äôt have as strong as others. I can plan. I can flank. I can outwit. But I can‚Äôt aim and am not as good with my reflexes as others.
---
So, this change means that they‚Äôre less for me. This doesn‚Äôt make them bad or broken, per se. Just not for me. So it‚Äôll encourage me to play to other characters that reward my strengths more. No hard feelings; just like if my favorite shoe company only made a product in a size 9. It isn‚Äôt worse, but I can‚Äôt wear it.
---
spirit not plague
---
He is my lowest killer, lvl 3 lol. Tried him once or twice, I think his bottles require touch time to fill and his aim is really awkward.
---
no, I love you
---
Come on guys. Yeah, sure, Legion was frustrating to go against I get it. But this nerf is going to make him so weak and practically useless. It's too much of a nerf.
---
IRONIC?
---
I never said I was upset.
---
What got changed? He was my first killer cause I enjoy that female skin .
---
If they give up struggling on the hook then they look like they got mori'd
---
Thank you, you are doing gods work
---
Because Legion was horribly, horribly unfun to play against. You either spend half the game mending, or Legion tunnels you down with almost no way to avoid it.
---
Do you... not know that Doc's shock disables Survivor interactions for a few moments?
---
I think people who've played this game endlessly who don't want to play other games get tired of playing a game the way the devs intended so they play the way they want. It sucks
---
This response is hilarious, considering no one has even played him yet
---
Hehehehehehe
---
In their defense, it might actually be hard for them to disable them. The seasonal offerings are tied to events, and so they get turned off when the event ends. It is likely that they could only do that with them by closing the event, not just blocking them separately.
---
It is just me guessing, of course. At least the bans are only temporary.
---
That's a great idea!
---
Actually she‚Äôs ^(ugly as heck) without her mask
---
I think you two are saying the same thing: can't please everyone.
---
Things like where the killer is and who is on what gen and whether the killer is heading in your direction, etc. This knowledge is extremely helpful and killers largely rely on survivors not having this amount of knowledge.
---
I‚Äôm loving the amount of effort that went into this edit.
---
I'd pick infinite strength
---
I read it and at first I was like ‚Äúok ok‚Äù
---
Then i saw FF and deep wound changes and congrats BHVR when (and IF) the legion changes go to live I will become a survivor main. How I love wasting my time for the on a character I actually had fun playing in any video game for them to become unfun
---
Lol that weird nonhuman sound he makes 
---
OHOHOHHHHEHHE i can't deal with how dumb it is but i guess he is a cannibal after all what do i even expect other than weird noises ohohohhhhahh LMAO
---
Although they are pretty bad devs, at least they somewhat listen to the community unlike some devs *cough* Ubisoft *cough*
---
Have killers even been complaining about survivors a lot lately? I'm really asking because I don't know. I wouldn't think so because killer is the easiest it's ever been.
---
Docs that do this are a shame to the good Doc mains out there
---
Lol nice projection. You were clearly triggered.
---
They were able to retire the light bouquets as well, which were not seasonal at all. They can, they‚Äôre just lazy. Same reason why they raced to do a bunch of nerfs (some needed, some absolutely not) on Legion rather than a thoughtful rework to properly satisfy people‚Äôs complaints.  
---
Banning users who unknowingly trigger an exploit is never okay, even if temporary. Especially when Devs can prevent it. This also doesn‚Äôt do much to aid quality of life for survivors since killers can still exploit it, banned or not.
---
Well technically Freddy has no power at all, rather a disadvantage and Bubba is an apple user since he hates windows (stay away from mates and close to windows and he ain't a problem). Trapper tho can block narrow passeges like in the game or ironworks, block loops and protect hexes. I mean it's nothing huge, but it has an impact on the game even if you don't catch a single person with the traps
---
Whenever I see anything like a change that people hate I just laugh in hillbilly and meg
---
those fucking type of survivors man! whenever i see them "attempting to escape" i never go for them, you want help? stay still you bitch, we're coming 
---
when they try to escape that's them telling me "don't come for me i want to die" or "dw i got this" so either way, i'm not coming to unhook you
---
&gt;They removed the moonwalk glitch
---
Wonderful!
---
&gt; Any time you‚Äôre in the terror radius your bleed out timer won‚Äôt go down.  You must wait for the entire meter to fill before using frenzy. If you  miss an attack during frenzy, frenzy is cancelled. You can‚Äôt down people  with frenzy anymore, so hitting them more than once is a waste of time.  Frenzy speed is reduced. They do move at base movement speed now. 
---
ARE YOU FUCKING RETARDED DEVS
---
if "er okay?" to you must mean someone is totes triggered kek then you're probably a very sensitive person
---
Ehh personally they were a rare killer to see but deep wounds not going down and no bloodstains hurt a lot faster movement speed is cool but ain't proper compensation
---
THANKS TO THE NURSE WHO CAMPED ME IN THE BASEMENT AND THEN CALLED ME THE N WORD IN POST-GAME CHAT. REALLY MAKES ME WANT TO KEEP PLAYING DBD!!
---
Now it's time to complain about how Dance With Me has never been on a shrine. I want to be a ninja!
---
But there are things you can do as killer to apply map pressure. It doesn't matter how much knowledge they have. One hooked with another slugged slows the game down a lot. There are so many things killer can do. And anyway, not every swf is even like that. Pretty rare to get many sweaty swfs that care about stuff like that.
---
Why not just open a gate/hop on the nearest gen?
---
I think removing frenzy when you miss a swing is a great idea, the other ideas not so much.
---
I like pairing it with sole Survivor so that it's essentially a two way Mirror
---
Dance with me. It has never been on the shrine.
---
I'd argue that his chasing ability is better than Pig. Since he can easily get multiple survivors injured quickly and keep them injure alternatively force them to waste time healing. After that first "free" hit he only has to hit you once to down you. Slap on Enduring + Spirit Fury and he will be a really scary killer. As a survivor you either spend a shitton of time healing up slowing the game down or you stay injured and risk being downed faster.
---
I don't get how any 4.6 m/s killer could be actually bad. You can get at least 2 sacs per game just by walking around and using the basic attack.
---
I did realize the locker was a stupid move and tried to escape right away, so that could explain it. 
---
But yea, she camped hard. All 4 of us technically escaped and she only hooked like 3 times in total. Not that good of a killer, lol.
---
No no, they'll add it in two months, break it the very next patch, then leave it broken again for six months before removing Ormond from the game.
---
Guess I'll go back to Doctor or Billy now
---
Considering he is now a 4.6 m/s killer, the power has been shifted into just his overall speed, being able to vault like a survivor, and deep wounds now serves as a way to waste survivor's time if they escape from you in a chase.
---
OK I SHOULD HAVE CLARIFIED. IF YOU HAVE PERKS TO HELP IN UNHOOKING ME THEN GREAT - THANK YOU BUT TO THOSE WHO DONT HAVE THE PERKS AND ARE JUST "TRYING TO HELP" I WISH THEY WOULD ADD A "BOOT IN THE FACE" OPTION SO I COULD TELL YOU TO LEAVE ME!
---
i love the doctor, he's not a boring basic killer who just chases and hooks
---
i never DC when its the doctor, super fun playing against him but i did get matches where people dc if its the doctor ;(
---
I hope they keep this way. I love playing games and not pipping or single pipping. Red Ranks are terrible queue wise and you want to avoid it as much as you can. 
---
Just like survivors playing against a bad killer won't pip either if they just get the gens and get out.
---
I can‚Äôt remember the name of the map, but there‚Äôs one with a yellow bus in it and the window on the side of the bus is bugged and has been for a while. You have to vault it twice - the first time you try you‚Äôll get teleported back in front of the window.
---
i like pig
---
Dude you‚Äôre in a thread hating on Legion and killer mains and you‚Äôre still getting downvoted to hell lol. Just give up while you‚Äôre ahead. You‚Äôre just insulting people at this point.
---
Yea, because fuck asking a harmless question to people who know something you don't, look it up so you never have to ask any questions ever again.
---
In this way, hopefully we can stop these stupid people trying to ask harmless questions to better understand something from people who have a better understanding of it.
---
I'm glad someone like you stood up and set these people straight.
---
Lol hope you like it
---
RIP *Legion* mains, tbh. Instead of their Killer being revamped so that he was viable without crutch addons and abusing game mechanics, so that people could play as and against him and actually have fun, it was made practically useless. If shit like that ever happened to my main I would probably just uninstall...
---
i love the outfit!!
---
The emblem system is meant to create a close-call fun game for every one. If one side mows the other side there is less reward for that side. I like to have discussions with killers who do this because you're hurting your rank and your BP gain. I know it sounds crazy, but when you're playing against idiots, don't sweat on em so much. I'm not saying, "go easy on survivors if they're bad!" but for the sake of your BP gain and your pips, let up a bit. If you got 2 slugs and a guy hooked in the basement and you just spotted the 4th, don't end the game by chasing that guy. pick up a slug, give the other guy a chance to save or pick up the slug. this opens the oppurtunity to get more BP through chase and brutality, thus giving you better emblems
---
Hehehe can't even feel sorry for that bullshit killer
---
Having a killer who‚Äôs basically useless isn‚Äôt fun on the opposing end either. It‚Äôs not like the scenario was fundamentally ‚ÄúLegion gets kept exactly as is‚Äù or ‚ÄúLegion is nerfed the point of being utterly useless.‚Äù They could‚Äôve done the ‚ÄúLegion gets an actually decent rework to satisfy absolutely everyone,‚Äù but that‚Äôd take actual effort which the dev team consistently shows they‚Äôre unwilling to put inZ 
---
He does get an easier first hit with frenzy, albeit they‚Äôre even nerfing *that* to make his only meaningful power hard to use (larger terror radius, slower movement speed, unable to use blood to track people, needing to wait for the complete cooldown, and having the cooldown go to zero if you miss a single swing). That said, other killers such as The Wraith and Amanda Outside of that he more or less has absolutely no power to help him, especially during chases where it matters most. While Mend is meant to be a way of slowing down the game, 15 seconds of mending is an absolutely minuscule amount of time, especially compared to the Pig‚Äôs RBTs or the Plague‚Äôs ability to infect people, neither of whom are top tier killers in the first. Even Freddy is capable of exerting more map pressure and slowing the game down.
---
By using this strategy with fast vaulting, it becomes a makeshift lithe as well.
---
He disabled for 2.5seconds but the survivor was shocked at 14 seconds and unable to vault until 18 seconds. That's due to lag unless the survivor was extraordinarily shit, which can always be true too lol.
---
I don't swf. I'm a killer main. When I do survivor, I solo queue. And I think it says something about people that complain about survivors still when killer is literally the easiest it's ever been. It's actually been boring to play as killer this last chapter. But yeah. SWF op.
---
Honestly they may as well have; it'd be better off getting rid of him completely compared to leaving him a broken husk that once had the potential for a rework that would make him fun to both play as and against, without the need for Frank's Mixtape and moonwalking.
---
Still.
---
Let me summarise something for you.
---
Right now, when using frank‚Äôs mixtape you need only 3 hits to down a survivor. First one puts them into deep wound. Second one depletes half of their timer. Third one downs them. Legion loses all of his power gauge after the second and third hit.
---
 However, you think that they should need only 2 hits to down. This would be so ridiculously overpowered, that it would make the game unplayable.
---
lol this is some top kek bullshit
---
Ah you're trolling around, I get ya.
---
Insta-down hatchets are broken and everyone knows that, they should look into that  
---
all seeing wraith and pig? anyone uses those?  
---
all myers's pink and purple addons are balanced
---
camping isn't such a problem
---
survivors have much stronger perks, that's why their items and offerings aren't that strong  
---
killers have to use those one time things to compete
---
Hey OP where did you find this template ?
---
Yeah that's exactly what's gonna happen honestly
---
This happened to me on a 3 gen 4k yesterday. I did pip I know they probably didn't either. So who is winning here? You mean to tell me neither one of us are winning?
---
That's awful &gt;\_&lt; i'm so sorry man
---
Ok first and foremost, dont listen to tilted people in the aftergame, they will always try to make it sound like its your fault when it might be unfortunate circumstances.
---
Secondly, yes killer can lag but it mostly reflects back onto the survivors, though they themselves need to also have a decent connection. Dont fret about it too much, if a survivor has trash ping, they have the full right to leave the lobby its their fault for sticking with shit ping. Though i would recommend checking your connection through google, see if you need to change anything.
---
Cheers
---
Top kek omegalul Pog. Anything else?
---
Why not just add to the game now? 
---
Nothing really warrants a dbd 2 because they keep adding to it as is.
---
Imagine getting this heated over a video game.
---
YES, BUT THEY'D BE EVEN LESS FUN TO PLAY AS NOW. IT DOESN'T TAKE TESTING TO UNDERSTAND THAT, LIKE, WHAT'S EVEN THE POINT OF USING THEIR POWER NOW? LANDING ONE HIT SLIGHTLY FASTER? THE PREMISE OF THE LEGION THEMSELVES IS INHERENTLY FLAWED. IT'D BE ONE THING IF THE WHOLE DEEP WOUNDS THING WAS REMOVED AND THEY COULD DOWN NORMALLY, THAT'D JUST MAKE THEM INTO A NURSE WITH EXTRA STEPS, JUST ADD LONGER ABILITY CHARGE TIMER. BUT THIS? HOT BOO-BOO MESS. DUMPSTER FIRE PAR EXCELLENCE.
---
Have you read the post ? Don't think you did.
---
I said i'm fine with the power to stop if you miss.

It appeared once before

you call this a DOODLE? this is expert level art! it's amazing! (i wish i could draw like that! especially HANDS. evil HANDS)

I still have like 20 of these things, i wish i could trade them in for bp now. :(
---
How do you go from "I can do this all day" to "Let me have the kill or I'll fuck us both over"

But that's just it, isnt it? Hag can quick lay down an antelope trap (or fake it) and the spirit can mind game her way out.

---
This reddit in a nutshell bro
---
What if they just stick with changes like the timer stopping inside the terror radius and removing blood pools for legion but keeping the ability of feral frenzy to down someone in 4 hits (but only activating at 100%)? Obviously changing Frank's mixtape so that it does another effect (like allowing the legion to see blood pools) and keeping the legion's movement speed at 110% of course, so that he is forced to use feral frenzy. That way there shouldn't be anymore exploits and losing legion mid chase should be easier too. 
---
With this, legion would take more time to down someone, but at least he won't get looped, even though he could lose the survivor.
---
yeah stop lying. it's embarrassing
---
1. i can agree with that
---
2. why would they want to put that kind of work in when they can just use steamworks/psn ? seems like a lot of work for them to do in order to cater to a niche audience. 
---
3. no comment, because i don't play killer a lot
---
4. this i would like.  especially because some killers have boring moris
---
5. given the matchmaking problems on a single platform, i just don't think it is feasible to stretch themselves out.
---
6. i personally don't like this option, as i prefer that all survivors are the same, statistically speaking of course.
---
So... having more things to push you into other roles is... bad?
---
I'm saying have more dailies. If you do them daily, you should be able to do three, not just the one you get currently.
---
I shouldn‚Äôt be punished for winning and I‚Äôm gonna keep playing the way I play until bhvr realizes that even though one side isn‚Äôt having fun, the killer or survivors shouldn‚Äôt be punished for doing too against the other side. It‚Äôs not healthy for the game.
---
BTW I didn‚Äôt sweat the survivors decided to hide in corners with bright clothes against billy, they were really fukin bad
---
Not even related but ill let you vent.
---
We call her pig bc she is free of sin in the game, if she is the same person as the one in the movies then she is a bad girl. Simply put. the pig and Amanda are 2 dif people bc how Onk the pig is
---
Build up hype and increase sales by showing off the killer, survivor, etc. pre-release. 
---
Seriously. If their refusal to fix the Mount Ormond glitch pre-release (leading them to launch and later pull the map) didn‚Äôt show people that BVHR pays zero attention to PTB feedback, absolutely nothing will.
---
NOED IS A FUCKING PERK THE FUCKING GAME GIVES ME TO USE
---
IT'S NOT CHEATING TO FUCKING USE IT
---
IT'S PLAYING THE FUCKING GAME
---
GET BETTER AT IT IF YOU'RE THAT FUCKING MAD, BECAUSE YOU'RE TRASH ANYWAYS
---
I'm actually fairly annoyed by that, I want it and haven't bothered with Kate :(
---
I prefer ‚ÄúOink Mistress‚Äù but you do you I guess.
---
But COD and FIFA and GTA all have different stories each game. DBD does not, it‚Äôs the same multiplayer gameplay each game and it‚Äôs not necessary to make a second one if they just add stuff to the first one.
---
This has happened to me a few times. It sucks because I am entirely useless to my team unless I devote myself to just distracting the killer, which I suck at because I (quite literally) cannot juke to save my life. But I don‚Äôt wanna be a dick and DC.
---
MAYBE YOU SHOULD HAVE JUST BLOCKED HIM TO BEGIN WITH, THERE ISNT A RULE ABOUT HAVING TO TALK TO RANDOM DICKS ON THE INTERNET, ITS OK JUST NOT LOOK AT IT. IDK THATS JUST HOW I LOOK AT IT
---
CHEERS
---
If he didn‚Äôt have Frank‚Äôs mixtape (which DID need to be nerfed, holy shit was that OP), then Legion was nowhere near as dangerous. He can‚Äôt be in frenzy forever and gets stunned after hits, the goal is to hide and break the chase rather than loop him endlessly. 
---
Beyond that, if they kept the ‚ÄúLegion goes out of frenzy for missed attacks,‚Äù it‚Äôd absolutely add massive counterplay. Changing how you have to manage chases is a good thing given the ‚ÄúRun in circles‚Äù meta is the most excruciatingly boring meta I have ever personally experienced.
---
I don‚Äôt think you understand why DBD and bigger games are different.
---
If you even find one to get matched against; I think the Legion mains are the ones eating glass now tbh. Like yeah he's 115% now but also Deep Wounds is useless. Also I don't see how calling him a M1 Killer can be a good thing; he doesn't even have something to help end his chases quickly and with a down like the Clown or Leatherface. His Feral Frenzy duration is longer but the speed is also dropped, besides you can't stack hits after you give everyone Deep Wounds and now you can't even see how close they are to bleeding out, and so long as you're near them or they start Mending they have nothing to worry about. And if their bleed DOES start ticking down, they know you're at least 32m away so it's safe to stop and Mend. His power is basically useless, and that (aside from his appearance and cosmetics) was the only reason to even play him, same as any Killer. So unless someone wants to put themselves at a disadvantage by having a practically worthless power, or just really loves the character, I don't think we'll be seeing many Legions anymore...
---
I love how despite ripping a bong at the side lines he's still in ready to pounce stance.
---
They'll never do that. They won't change anything if you don't play ball. With their nerf, slightly longer mending time would offset it. Making him a killer that is weak but slows the game down enough to catch up to survivors.
---
Here's an idea: don't change mending time, but make it so that when you have deep wound as long as you're in his terror radius the mend timer won't go down. Unless he gets into a Chase with someone else. That would prevent moonwalking
---
I feel you. I wouldn't say you're being punished for winning. Like i said, it's almost like punishing yourself. When games end quick like this you don't get BP. I mean we all have different priorities, but to me i like to leave every game with the most amount of BP. I'm not gonna tell ya how to play or what your priorities should be but ya know that's how the emblem system was designed. I'm not saying it's the best design but i back the fact that you have to be good at all categories. I like what you said in your other comment about survivors not getting benevolent because nobody got hooked, the system definitely needs changes but i think it reasonable that you rank up by fulfilling the categories
---
More duration - speed = fuck all. No matter what speed it is, if it's less, it's going to most likely be worse.
---
DID YOU.... SLOW THE GAME DOWN JUST A LITTLE BIT?
---
So you're ok with having a second unused character for at least a year?
---
Not buff enough.
---
TOTEMS NEED TO BE HIDDEN BETTER. WHY THE FUCK ARE SURVIVORS SPAWNING RIGHT ON TOP OF MY TOTEMS?!?!?!?!?!?!
---
I assume that the add-ons will be fixed by the time the patch goes live. I'm not really sure about the whole thing yet. With a longer timer on his power and addons to increase speed, it may be easier to chain hits on multiple survivors, especially since he has a larger terror radius now. He is definitely loopable now, but many other killers are and still perform pretty well. Getting a free hit is pretty powerful. Most m1 killers need to win 2 mind-games to down a survivor, or somehow compensate with their power. Being a 115% movement speed killer puts him on the same level as the others to win on loops as well.  
---
If he does come out to be as weak as people are expecting, BHVR will probably do some changes after the PTB. I think these changes may have been a bit overkill, but I don't think it will be as bad as people are guessing.
---
I‚Äôve had this happen several times. Although it‚Äôs especially satisfying when the killer refuses to play along and downs them anyways.
---
You can actually alter the text!
---
okay i get what you're saying but you bring in, lets say, bitter murmur so that you can see where people are at. It's a wasted perk slot if you can't see auras with an aura perk
---
There's a couple of ways.
---
1. Fake the aura, it only lasts 4 seconds, just run in a direction, count down from 4, and then switch directions.
---
2. Hiding behind the aura of a generator CAN make you difficult to see. The effectiveness here varies from game to game.
---
3. Get close to the hook. BBQ only shows auras outside of a 40m radius.
---
4. Hide in a locker for the 4 seconds, your aura will be hidden.
---
I mained Bubba for awhile, theres nothing more satisfying then mastering an obstacle course and suprising the ever living shit out of a survivor
---
I already saw myself as one but not legion, just a young gang that needs a better power
---
He has the best teachables of any killer. It‚Äôs not a waste.
---
In the end he‚Äôs the dumb one. Even pulling your router, the surv will still get their points and it counts as an escape for them. He essentially gave OP the escape in a way that gave him no points.
---
MoM shows just how little foresight the devs put into creating perks. They should always ask themselves what is the perk like when 4 people run it in one game. Is it broken? Then back to the drawing board. Is it not? Then it's fine. I'm all for the solo experience getting better, but survivor perks need to be balanced around SWF imo.
---
all they had to do was make missing a hit in frenzy remove Frenzy, that would be a minor nerf when played optimally and would prevent people from cheesing their way to victory with him by adding counterplau options and by punishing bad plays on Legion's part.
---
Legion's problem was he didn't have counterplay and didn't punish the killer for making mistakes, which in turn makes giving any sort of strength unwarranted.
---
You're a conspiracy theorist. 
---
Its RNG boys.  How many perks are there now per side?
---
The probability of getting exact perks is pretty low
---
The experience you have getting 4ks with a killer like leatherface is more useful than bbq will ever be at higher ranks.
---
How does one 360. I watch Noob do it effortlessly and have yet to be able to do it. Pls send tips.
---
Not really. People would be/have been complaining about shrine conspiracy since the games release...  RNG gods are a cruel mistress
---
I use Bond to avoid leading the killer to other survivors while being chased, but if I can see a teammate hatch camping while I‚Äôve worked my butt off to pop gens all match and am currently getting chased, I have zero moral qualms with leading the killer in their direction.
---
Actually *you* seem like the one being mad right now. The other guy literally didn‚Äôt do anything and you‚Äôre just shoving assumptions about him being salty down his throat lmao
---
Found the adrenaline/MoM user. How else do you expect clown/pig to deal with those meta perks?
---
Playing high ranks without auras is a deathwish.
---
Nope thats just u man
---
Dope I feel honored
---
Yeah if he disconnects you still get points.... ‚Äú oh no... don‚Äôt turn off your internet!‚Äù
---
The strategy for him now is just gonna be hit once with ff then left click. Anything else isn‚Äôt worth it and if they somehow get away from you after feral frenzy they have to mend which slightly stalls out the game but all mend pressure is gone. You can now hide in terror radius wait to be out of it then heal and legion has no way of knowing if they are pressuring you with bleed or not. 
---
All of this they could at least make it so nurses can now see mending since legions tracking has gone way down.
---
Just as I spend all my shards on the clown.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm just in hoping for the better that won‚Äôt come lol
---
I honestly wouldn‚Äôt trust BVHR to fix anything they didn‚Äôt explicitly promise to (see: Mount Ormond in PTB). And even then, I wouldn‚Äôt (see: Console Optimazation where they tried to double back and lie about what they promised). They couldn‚Äôt even be bothered to actually disable these add-one because of sheer laziness. 
---
Most other killers have stronger abilities; The Pig and The Plague can stall the game, The Doctor crippled stealth players, Leatherface at least has an instant down. The Wraith, at least, isn‚Äôt severely punished for its stealth play and can track blood and other things. Legion is basically a worse version of the Pig now (surprise first hit and ‚Äú‚Äú‚Äústall‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù potential). 
---
BVHR absolutely does not make changes on PTB feedback. They never have in the past and they aren‚Äôt going to now. Moonwalking Legion was an issue since the PTB and didn‚Äôt get resolved till now. Mount Ormond was glitched in the PTB, they ignored feedback, launched the map as is, had to pull it to fix the glitch, then relaunched it. The new lobby system they ended up reverting was absolutely despised in the PTB and considered extremely inefficient, but they went ahead with it anyways only to need to revert it. The new pip system was utterly reviled by all sides, they launched it and changed nothing. If I can‚Äôt trust BVHR to resolve a *glitch* based on PTB feedback, I certainly don‚Äôt see them doing actual balance fixes. 
---
All they seem to respond to is vocal hatred (Freddy, Legion, Decisive Strike), so that‚Äôs basically going to be the most effective method of resolving anything.
---
I will play with most Docs, but if they're running the awful 4 perk combo I just won't. I'm playing to have fun and if they're doing The Four Perk Combo they're probably the type of person who finds amusement in a dc anyways.
---
Which I don't understand, but whatever. I don't really care if I die in a game I just won't do an awful 30 minute 3 gen nightmare because it's not fun at that point. I have limited time to play and I'd like to enjoy my time there.
---
I agree entirely. I didn't understand why him being made a 'M1 Killer' was supposed to be a positive; his ability was supposed to supplement that, like Trapper or Clown or Wraith, but now that his ability has been trashed to hell and back it's like you don't even have a meaningful power. Even Wraith got that little speed boost coming out of cloak since it takes him 3 seconds at reduced speed without addons, making his ability a hell of a lot better even just with that so you don't get left entirely in the dust when you try to pull a sneaky on someone and spend a minute just getting close enough to threaten them again. I would have rather seen them do something to BUFF his power in some way so that the use of addons like Frank's Mixtape and the whole moonwalking mechanic abuse thing are no longer crutch tactics, so that he's a viable Killer without the cheap tricks and cheesy one liners. I'm a believer in making things better so that they're up to par with everything else, fixing problems that drive people to use exploits and high-level addons every game, rather than nerfing them into oblivion.
---
FUCKING BHVR CAN'T YOU BALANCE THE GAME PROPERLY THE NEW "CHANGES" MAKE LEGION HORSESHIT
---
You clearly haven't played much freddy, you just look at the 7 seconds to sleep someone and make your judgment without looking at his amazing effects he can have on the game.
---
We asked for *an update*, not *this update*. There is a difference. You can want something to be changed because it doesn‚Äôt work as is but still hate the actual change made.
---
My bad, I thought that it said can understand why, not can‚Äôt.
---
I mean unless my math is horribly off, no. But believe what you will.
---
I love to help people (: i am a huge fan of Noob too. been watching him since i started playing. Are you PC or console? If you're console i gave a guy who commented some tips here's that if you're on console. 
---
&gt; Just gotta practice. REMEMBER, your sticks have to face different directions (right stick in, left stick out), turning up your sensitivity helps, and timing is everything. Also this doesn't work on every body, usually not as good killers.
---
Thank you!
---
They‚Äôd be legally obligated to give refunds if they actually deleted him. (Nevermind that they honestly should be refunding people since for all purposes they‚Äôre deleting him).
---
I mean, no shit. Auras are extremely important, without them the game becomes a lot harder for both sides.
---
Azarov‚Äôs resting?
---
I'll admit that is largely true, but they did change the Plague. They reduced the MS to 110% while her vomit is charged, along with a few other things.
---
That's about 30 seconds of unneeded footage my dude
---
STOP COMPLAINING ABOUT LEGION NERF YOU FUCKING MORONS!! IT‚ÄôS TIME TO GET RID OF TOXIC SHITS WITH ZERO COUNTER PLAY, YA HEAR ME CUNT!!!?
---
Makes me think I should wish for more things in the future lol... a billion dollars... immortality... a Legion rework that fixes him by making him viable without crutch addons and exploits... WHOOPS did I say that last one out loud? E.E
---
I did and then I couldn't open it later.
---
Yeah for real. Not only am I pissed off at this, it's just the principal. BHVR must literally have apes testing their patches at this point, because nobody who actually plays the game actually sees this as a worthy change. I play survivor like 90% of the time, and I am STILL not satisfied with this. I want a killer that will actually be fun to play against, not this useless crap.
---
It is I, what people once hated, now feel bad for. A Legion main. I for one, want to test this massive change before completely ignoring this character. Let us believe.
---
I'm actually a little bit miffed. After convincing myself that BBQ will never be on the shrine, I bought the DLC... only for it to go on the shrine 3 days later. Actually mad.
---
This isn‚Äôt a rework though, it‚Äôs changes that don‚Äôt involve completely changing what their power is. Besides, they talked about the Freddy rework in the dev update, it‚Äôs going to require major core changes to the game before they can rework him, which explains the long delay.
---
hell yeah let's increase the amount of same top tier killers I see every game even more
---
Now you can do Bubba's basement. He may not be the strongest killer, but I'll be damned if I didn't have some great moments playing him.
---
When you hit levels 30, 35 and 40 on a character, the perks unique to that can be unlocked to appear in the bloodweb of other characters.
---
Generally referred to as teachable perks, or teachables.

For your claudette, this means that the perks Empathy, Botany Knowledge and Self Care will appear in your bloodweb from level 30, 35 and 40 respectively. You can recognize that it's the "teachable version" from the orange/red background also seen in the screenshot. Once taken, you can find those perks in the bloodwebs of other survivors: Meg, Dwight, etc.
---
Once a week the Shrine of Secrets found in the store, updates with 4 perks, 2 from killer, 2 from survivor. Each can be purchased for 2000 iridescent shards (select ones 2700 shards). If bought, you automatically unlock them for all bloodwebs, no need to level the Character the perk is unique to.
---
WHY ARE THERE SO MANY FREDDY PLAYERS ON PS4 RIGHT NOW! I KNOW PEOPLE SAY HE IS BAD BUT I LITERALLY CAN NOT PLAY AGAINST HIM FOR SOME REASON. MY LAST FOUR MATCHES HAVE BEEN AGAINST HIM AND ITS SO ANNOYING ALSO WHY DO PEOPLE DC AS IM TRYING TO SAVE THEM FROM A HOOK WHEN THE KILLER IS THREE GENERATORS AWAY
---
So.... the only feedback they actually listen to in the PTB is what aspects of killers should be nerfed? 
---
The only other thing I remember that they listened to was people complaining about hatch closing and said ‚ÄúOkay fine. We‚Äôll just make you suffer through hatch standoff‚Äôs again and do nothing.‚Äù (Which isn‚Äôt what anyone actually wanted).
---
Yea he was definitely becoming annoying on the survivors side
---
I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll read this and hire you on the spot since you know a lot about matchmaking and coding. 
---
Seriously though, relax. I‚Äôve never seen a bigger overreaction out of anybody in my life. Matchmaking isn‚Äôt even that bad right now.
---
Great job BHVR for not at all listening to the community lol
---
I just suck with he and the Billy lol. The chainsaw Killers are beyond me.
---
But the Huntress, well... that's another story ;)
---
yeah man it's so easy to find trapper traps without auras lmao
---
Another triggered one.
---
Look at those graceful mvoements. You didn't invite him, he invited you.
---
He had some good videos but literally why? There is no need to delete your channel it reeks of wanting attention.
---
Yes. Exactly like they did with Freddy a year and a half ago. Look at how long it‚Äôs taken them for the devs to actually rework him now (and the jury is still out on if the rework is halfway decently).
---
As for their notes, this dev team has a habit of repeatedly lying to people (see: Console Optimization) and being exceptionally lazy (see: Mount Ormond). I‚Äôll believe it when I see it.
---
It‚Äôs still only two Frenzies. The difference is with the new changes you get stunned if you miss. Allows for counter play on the survivors‚Äô side and requires the Legion to be accurate with their running hits.
---
Ok the spawns next to ruin are actual bs, but 4 people running adrenaline and m.o.m? Youre already running against survivor friends and chances are, get this, they just want to have fun like everyone else. If shit like that happens id personally reccomend getting over this and just playing the game, maybe try to better yourself and practice
---
Dude... maybe take a break from the game for a little while.
---
If you‚Äôre this upset that a game is buggy, maybe it‚Äôs time to go outside for a bit.
---
actually happened t me
---
It's so fun trying to find slugged survivors when the auras are complete ass. I must just rely too much on auras though, I should just have ESP and know where they are anyway like all good survivors.
---
im on my quest to get leaderface for leatherface, be back in 5 years
---
The least they could have done is refunded my fucking shards. I likely won‚Äôt play legion ever again.
---
I'm on PC and i understand the mechanics of it but its mostly timing/when to do it and in what situations its applicable. Thanks for the response!
---
Gotta love strawmanning. People didn't want Legion to become useless, and the "remove Legion" meme was never taken seriously by anyone with a brain. Killer mains and survivors alike didn't neccesarily want another killer to become useless, and thus probably played a lot less, we just wanted a rework that would balance Legion and give them a fun counterplay. 
---
TLDR: People hated Legion before because they had no counterplay, now people are pissed yet again by BHVR's poor balancing decisions when they effectively make Legion useless, and not-fun for both sides.
---
Just get better at the game and you'll know where your traps are with your immense skill. /s
---
Killer sided
---
So then I am guessing you ran the speed add-ons for Legion? Like Susie's tape and the Caffine Pills.
---
True, but adrenaline is so popular there‚Äôs a pretty good chance almost everyone has it, even at low ranks.
---
Honestly yeah, any exploits should be fixed ASAP, but I think Legion should have been fixed up a little. The effect of everyone using crutch tactics originates from a cause: namely, that he is underpowered and it's extremely hard to do well without them. I feel like chasing the effects means nothing compared to addressing the cause; it's like treating the symptoms of being poisoned instead of taking the antidote - its nonsensical.

115% ms, bigger TR to track survs in power, longer power duration- sure the power goes on CD when you whiff, not full CD like some people are saying. It was confirmed on the forums to only need to charge as much as you used it for. So if you whiffed with 75% of the power left you still only need five seconds or so to get it back. I REALLY don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs as bad as everyone is making it out to be. Almost everything they changed was due to abusable mechanics, which I can confidently say 9/10 of my matches against a Legion were being abused. People really like taking advantage of unfair stuff and I feel like that‚Äôs being very much ignored in all this turmoil.
---
What is the mount Ormond glitch? I can't find anything on it
---
Prepare for a new type of toxicity. Hitting a survivor with FF and then getting infront of them with reduced cooldown and downing them. All the "changes" are overkill but FF not depleting the timer is total bullshit.
---
 Basically if I go against a bad killer I may not pip, the killer won't pip and vice versa. The issue here is if one side is too good they get no reward. So in other words dont play your best if you are going against a bad player. Let them win. I  mean generally it would make since to pair someone with a player that has the same skill level but the ranking isn't accurate because good players may be punished so instead of moving on to play with equally skilled players they dont rank because one of many reasons. Playing with a bad team or a bad killer. That's not counting if you get hard tunneled or face camped which will delay rank even more. My skills aren't top notch I'm not the greatest player and these are my problems as a average player.
---
Yeah Tbh i can't really explain timing to you but i can tell you it's the most important thing. Gotta practice to know it. What i do is fake a side, spin the other side. You have to start the fake just as the swing is ABOUT to start, so by the end of the swing they don't have time to land it where you will actually land. That's the best description i can give. I'm actually getting a PC soon so i'll get to relearn lol
---
Try this link, it's there for sure. People were talking about it in McLean's chat while he was streaming last night so it is a confirmed mechanic.
---
https://reddit.com/comments/bdx86v/comment/el1opf9?context=3
---
&gt; You would enter fatigue. If you didn't, it would be a little too easy to abuse it by catching up to a survivor in frenzy, turning away, missing a swing and then hitting them with a regular attack to down them.
---
I don't camp the hatch, if they need it, i have already won.
---
This community is so annoying lol. I think legion was annoying because of the exploit and some addons. His play style was pretty unfun for survivors but definitely not overly strong or anything. The nerfs were overkill imo, but can you really blame the devs when YOU ALL LITERALLY BEGGED FOR THE CHARACTER TO BE DELETED SINCE HIS RELEASE????? 
---
You reap what you sow, kids.
---
I think it might be the Autowrecker Map, the one with the Gas Station.
---
BBQ &amp; Chili is one of the top tier and meta perks for killers, and normally you need to buy Leatherface to unlock it. Since Leatherface is a licensed killer you have to buy him with real cold hard cash.
---
B&amp;C reveals the survivors' location when you hook somebody if they're 40 or more meters away, and it grants a 25% bloodpoint bonus for each survivor you hook for the first time. So if you at least hook everyone once you'll get a 100% bloodpoint bonus.
---
So not only is it a magnificent perk for tracking the survivors, but it's also great for grinding out bloodpoints.
---
Ayyee remember your comment, Team Lithe is finally here
---
I always burn puzzle pieces because Doc in that map is brutal. Did it the other day so not sure what you're talking about
---
This is the tactic I use, especially if it‚Äôs a one hit down killer like T3 Myers, Bubba or sometimes Billy if I can swerve fast enough.
---
ITS FUCKING RAGE WEDNESDAY! IM PISSED OF AND THERES NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT!
---
Alrighty lol, how many of your alt accounts did you use to downvote everyone? Did it really hurt your feelings? Just confused on why you got so mad about the BBQ comment.
---
dont worry its shroud of seperation i swears
---
Except we didn't make a 180. We didn't ask for nerfs, we asked for a reasonable rework. Nice try though. At least you got your karma.
---
Power trip. That‚Äôs all Hatch standoffs are, just a dick measuring contest.
---
Anyone with a sense of clarity will just take the L or go do Gens. Wasting 30 minutes/an hour for that domination over an Internet stranger is just weird.
---
It feels like BHVR had a couple good ideas that might be good on their own but someone just decided ‚Äúscrew it. Add them all at once.‚Äù 
---
Personally, what what I‚Äôd do is scrap basically every change they made, except missing stabs ending frenzy, then to counter balance it and stick with legions who ‚Äústab everyone.‚Äù Gameplay by making chaining frenzy hits between different survivors during one activation increase the strength of the power until it runs out, then it would reset. 
---
Also, invest more time into reworking the chase mechanics to eliminate moonwalking, because the upcoming change was a band-aid fix, and reduces the viability of perks such as unnerving presence on legion
---
I personally like the update, but I think they took it a little far. I do like how they reward actually leaving FF to chase like I do. Source: am a legion main
---
Yep
---
Hell yeah! Just when I was about to cave and pour 1,000,000 bp into feng lol
---
I got all of the DLC during the winter sale, I'm just glad I could finally get BBQ since LVing up LF along with the many, many other killers I have would just be a hastle.
---
That‚Äôs actually very true
---
So like plague. Dbd has more killers than original ideas.
---
It seems like every update BHVR does nowadays is a band aid fix
---
Legion: *i'm gonna put you down*

P3 Claudette: *hold my beer*

AIGHT I'M FULL OF THIS SHIT AND I'M SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING QUITTING. THE DC ISSUE IS KILLING THIS GAME. NOW THAT THEY REMOVED THE ONLY FORM OF "PUNISHMENT" FOR DC'ING (TO GET RID OF INT DERANKING) THE WHOLE THING HAS ESCALATED. IT'S BEEN 5 GAMES IN A ROW WHERE SOMEONE, EITHER SURVS OR THE KILLER HIMSELF DC AS SOON AS THEY DON'T LIKE SOMETHING, FOR THE DUMBEST REASONS POSSIBLE. THIS SHIT RUINS THE EXPIERENCE BOTH AS A SURV AND AS A KILLER. SURVS THAT DC AT THE FIRST DOWN, OR EVEN AS SOON AS THEY SEE THE KILLER, LEAVING THE OTHER SURVS WHO ACTUALLY WANT TO PLAY IN SUCH A SHITTY SITUATION. AND AS SOON AS YOU'RE HAVING A MATCH WHERE YOU (SURVS) ARE "WINNING" THERE'S THE KILLER WHO DC'S CAUSE THINGS  DIDN'T GO AS HE PLANNED. ADD SOMETHING LIKE A LOBBY WAITING TIME OR JUST BAN THOSE WHO ABUSE THIS STUFF IDK PLS
---
I mean I can list a half-dozen killer that are 115% but still aren't really good off the top of my head, and all of them have a power that feels more impactful than the new Legion looks.
---
As I said, I'll give it a go on the PTB, but honestly I'm regretting getting cosmetics for them.
---
All very true. But honestly since Nurse's max range is smaller than his new Terror Radius, Survivors could just wait until the heartbeat is gone then start to Mend, and stop it the second they hear the heartbeat again so they don't show up with Nurse's. So honestly, unless they Mend in his Radius, where the Deep Wounds timer doesn't even move, he won't see them and Nurse's will be worthless to him (except for finding Survivors using regular healing of course).
---
I hated Legion because he was Freddy 2.0
---
He wasn‚Äôt OP, his power just relied on tunneling (Which not only is bad for the killer, but not fun to play against). 
---
I guess by nerfing the shit out of Legion, they‚Äôre indirectly raising Freddy up a tier.
---
What ~~does~~ did it do?
---
Thank you. I keep getting downvoted for voicing my opinion, but I really don't think the new Legion will be that bad. He'll have easier first hits that also force the survivors to mend, but will actually have the speed to finish chases like a normal killer. I feel like everyone is expecting new/reworked killers to be as powerful as Billy. This rework seems more that it'll put Legion around Wraith tier which isn't great, but is completely fine.
---
They should make a dbd 2. Better graphics, with a heavy emphasis on atmospheric, dreary weather effects. In that case, they should still support dbd 1 and it's regular game modes but open source the game and allow separate modes for user created mods.
---
Yeah i definitely see what you're saying. I mean i'm with it all the way, just like i told OP if you're going against dummies, let up a little bit. But i would say just cause a killer is bad doesn't mean you're not gonna pip as surv. What sucks for survivor is when the killer sucks, you chase them for 5 gens, leading to no saves and no gens which is a de pip. I'm not gonna say the emblem system is perfect, it's actually pretty bad, but i stand with the fact that you have to be able to do everything to get the most rewards. I believe there is some solution out there, and maybe one day they will find that solution
---
I‚Äôm taking a break from DBD for a bit because of this.
---
I just wasted like 6-7 Pink/Purple Hag add-ons because people kept DCing after being hit once/fucking up their pallet flip. They need to add Quitter Penalties.
---
If you preferred going vs legion over a "top tier killer" than you are literally rank 20 and should just stfu.
---
I was bored and, after reading a bunch of the Legion update related stuff on here, whipped this up in SFM. Let me tell you, making this was a little more complicated since the bar itself is a collection of props that you have to assemble, so that took a bit.
---
Either way, here's a thing.
---
One: this is obviously a survivor working with killer. How you don‚Äôt immediately see that is absurd.
---
Two: you have no idea how long that Dwight has been in that locker. Maybe they have quick and quiet and just jumped in when the killer heartbeat got close? 
---
Where are you getting information that lets you decide the Dwight was useless? It is just as likely that the Dwight has 15k points to the Nea‚Äôs 5k.  You don‚Äôt know the situation, but you come to a conclusion that best fits your bias, without reason or rationale.
---
Again, you know absolutely nothing of this situation. You are the John Snow of this situation. And yet you‚Äôve created this fantastical scenario in your head where you can feel vindicated against the Dwight because you don‚Äôt want to admit that OP is the asshole that broke the rules.
---
The only thing we can be certain of is that Nea worked with the killer to get the Dwight caught/killed.
---
Very possible, ik it‚Äôs one of wraith‚Äôs map, not sure which one though
---
Shortly after the steam sale too
---
I CAN'T FOR THE LIFE OF MINE 4K WITH HAG BUT I ALWAYS GET 30K BP WITH HER AND I'M FUCKING CONFUSED
---
It was used to Brighten/Darken the maps natural lighting.
---
My favourite was coordinating a Fog/Darkness add ons and just hiding in grass, never to be seen.
---
It's going in the right direction if you do nothing you dont pip. It's just a little extreme because if everyone did a equal amount of work on survivor would they pip? Let's say 1.25 gens each and once save each I dont know if they would all pip.
---
They try to address things that the community is mostly in agreement with, even if it takes them a while. Part of the problem is likely the focus they put on pumping out new content. I get it, they want to keep players coming back for new stuff, they are a business, etc... I do wish they would buckle down and focus on game balance for a little while though. One thing to note is that they have been doing more changes recently then I've seen before. Here's hoping that trend continues.
---
Yea I spend a lot of hours on this! but the result is top quality if I do say so myself!
---
FF not lowering the timer is too much. Everything is else is also overkill realy but FF not lowering the timer is just absolutely stupid. Completely pointless to even have FF at this point.
---
Nurse is not shit, you just need to learn how to use her powers
---
Their game barely functions
---
I don‚Äôt remember the details. I believe it was severely lagging or crashing for people in the PTB, but I could be wrong on the nature of the glitch. I know it was serious. 
---
What ended up happening was they ignored all the feedback about the map being a buggy and broken mess and released it at launch along with Jeff and Legion. Because none of the problems were actually fixed, all the non-PTB players still complained about facing the exact same glitches. BHVR pulled the map after launch until the bugs that people had warned them about from the beginning of the PTB were fixed then rereleased it, which is completely ridiculous for very obvious reasons (either fix the damn problem or don‚Äôt release it from the getgo).
---
You can see the laziness even  now when they won‚Äôt do something simple like deactivate the bugged legion add-one till the bug is fixed.
---
The rework is fine except for the depletion thing, hell nah is that okay.
---
True true
---
I should start doing that.
---
Found the guy that hides in a locker and justifies it in his head, lol. But on a serious note, the only information we have is Nea's side plus personal experience, and since I lose nothing by believing Nea's side, it's a funny clip where the Dwight got what he deserved. Working angles to make a hatch escape when your last surviving teammate was going to leave you to die and take hatch isn't working with the killer any more than hiding in a locker and handing a free kill to the killer is, and the differentiation between the two is mundane at best.
---
Dude. You can't judge this game unless you do so from it's inception. So yes, it has been getting better with every update. If we suddenly reverted back to 1.1.0 I'd also claim this game is shit. 
---
Your opinion is as valid as mine. I think this game is beyond fantastic as there is no other game that comes close to it. It's amazing and I hope other people see it as well. 
---
Ggwp
---
Man I just wanna come back from work and chill because this is my favorite game, I don‚Äôt mind the bugs, but I literally can‚Äôt even play the damn game that I paid for.
---
My ping has been always great since the last patch.
---
Wow.This was a perfect chance to make legion actually fun and viable to play but now hes basically freddy 2.0. 
---
Tell me,would you like to see a new killer that plays good and stands a chance against high ranked survivors,or face the same billy,nurse myers and spirit over and over again?
---
Nah, I just spent the extra time that the game would have lasted for to type this out since I won so quickly. 
---
Your tears are juicy
---
I swear everyone in this sub is 13 years old.
---
YOU START WITH 7, IT'S ALWAYS [NUMBER_OF_GENS_TO_GO + 2]
---
Almost 90% sure the killer was able to see me because my teammate could too lol. I was pulled out once.
---
Say what? Outside of her enhanced power after going to a fountain, it makes him a STRONGER Plague.
---
Welcome to Plebbit.
---
&gt;before removing Ormond from the game.
---
Again.
---
The game isn‚Äôt really that grindy. You play because you like it. Eventually you‚Äôll get BP. 
---
At first it sucks. But after you get a lvl 50 survivor/killer with good perks, there shouldn‚Äôt be an issue.
---
THAT LAD WAS DEFINITELY NOT INITIATED INTO THE WAYS OF A NURSE, WHEN TRUE NURSE MAIN IS IN YOUR GAME NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO YOU'RE FUCKED
---
actually the full story is that the previous game we had a piggy who was camping my friends last untrapping thingy untill he died and was really toxic afterwards. Next game it was the same killer so she took a mori and her ''main killer'' and decided to destroy us (even tho I wasnt toxic &gt;-&gt; ) so she didnt have a provlem with insta killing me and slugging my friend, it was hilarious tho c:
---
FF not lowering the DW timer is not overkill to you? Might as well not have it all at this point. What good is vaulting pallets if I  gain nothing.
---
[Nice repost](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/b3dsqi/how_is_this_still_a_thing/). It's literally the same exact image as well.  
---
What point are you trying to make by posting the exact same image you posted a month ago?
---
BE PATIENT FOR FREDDY REWORK, IT'S ALL GONNA BE BALANCED AS ALL THINGS SHOULD BE
---
You could say the same about the nurse or any killer that gets easy first hits. ‚ÄúWell either risk going down or heal yourself and lose out on time doing gens‚Äù isn‚Äôt unique to plague or legion at all.
---
VERY interesting question. I think the deciding factor would be how the chases went. But in my opinion, yes i think they would pip. Now lets say maybe 1 didn't escape, that guy might not pip. But like i said it's meant for long, close games. So if everybody got hooked twice but all escaped, the chances of every one doing the exact same amount of work are not likely. A game like this, more than likely being a long game, gives every one a chance for a different amount of saves, different outcomes in chases, and different spread of gens whether some get done solo or some done with 2-3 people on it. All in all i feel the system encourages long games where everybody has a chance to do something
---
There's only so many fiberglass thingamajibs you can bolt onto a Honda civic before you have to give up and buy a fucking Ferrari, that's why.
---
Why the heck do these developers constantly change a slew of things rather than little by little to achieve balance?
---
It seems to be a trend.
---
The entire community was in agreement that Mount Ormond was a buggy mess, that the new lobby system was terrible, that the new pip system was terrible, and that Moon Walking Legion was terrible during the PTBs. Absolutely nothing was done to remedy any of these until long *after* the PTB occurred. So it‚Äôs definitely not just about the community identifying problems. 
---
The escape hatch closing was actually pretty divisive, especially compared to the above four, but more liked than disliked because at least it meant hatch standoff‚Äôs weren‚Äôt a thing anymore. 
---
These are also the same people who are so lazy that they couldn‚Äôt be bothered to do something as basic as temporarily deactivate Legion‚Äôs bugged add-ons till they‚Äôre fixed (making players unaware of the nature of the bug susceptible to bans and obviously allowing exploiters to continue exploiting)
---
I‚Äôm really glad you said that, it‚Äôs exactly what I was thinking it was for. I just wish the popular thing to do wasn‚Äôt to immediately cause madness before something even happens. Mistakes have happened and all but I like to think the team has improved for them. 
---
That being said, what in your opinion pushes the needle too far? Genuinely curious to gain perspective
---
You mean jigsaw? :p

How do you get that mask

Couldn't have said it better myself

People are angry at The Legion nerfs? Why? He's trash tier now but that's way better than broken.

---
"I'd personally recommend getting over this and just playing the game, maybe try to better yourself and practice" 
---
Over 1000 hours on console buddy boy. I deal with it, I play the game despite this annoyance and win a lot more than I lose. Especially vs SWF. But this is perfect advice for all the survivor mains who cry about Killer buffs or NOED or anything.
---
let me see if i understand you correctly. You're upset over SWF groups. ok, fair enough. a lot of people don't like SWF.
---
so you saw a twitch streamer in your group. so what? i see them all the time when i solo, that doesn't mean shit.
---
your second paragraph is extremely vague. also, attacking everyone in this forum "this trash forum" doesn't really seem like a good way to convince people to that you're genuine or legitimate.
---
so, you saw a streamer, and a separate person with a flashlight. what the fuck are people supposed to do with the items from their bloodweb? sit on them? i like how you mentioned that you dropped your bloody party streamers, making it seem like you were going to be a benevolent to the lowly survivors, so long as they didn't bring flashlights or other undesirable items to your match. 
---
and it looks like you killed one person by mori. truth is, you have no idea if that person supported or opposed your vague "solution" to swf. 
---
i like how your "solution" to people **allegedly** joining SWF groups is to... kill them. i know you're trying to be toxic, but you're really just coming off as a little bitch. so you killed someone in the game. isn't that the killer's fucking job?
---
ps -- keep dodging lobbies, you're doing everyone else a favor by not subjecting them to your antics. You literally give all killers a bad name with your bitch ass play.
---
With distressing lmao
---
I kinda wish 360s didn't exist. Not because they're good (they're not, only works on low rank) but solely because it looks dumb, especially to friends I'm trying to get into the game.
---
Ok dude
---
FF not depleting the timer makes it entirely pointless
---
I wasn't *really* calling for him to be deleted, I was just expressing my frustration at how they essentially ruined his Power - the sole reason to play as one Killer over another. As you said, for all intensive purposes, he's basically as good as erased :T
---
(BTW greetings fellow Huntress!)
---
The pic on bottom left the killer is actually able to hit you üòÇ
---
I really only worry about blood points. What usually happens to me is I leave a gen to go for a save and then get almost to them for them to get pulled. Lol. If I knew that I would have finished the gen.
---
"Your tears are juicy"
---
what tears? i just don't get it.
---
Not sure what the huge fuss is over. He essentially works like Amanda now. He's an m1 killer that puts an extra obstacle on survivors to keep them from doing gens.
---
He has the speed of an m1 killer. Instead of wasting their time with RBT's, he wastes them with mend. While mend is a shorter duration than RBT, RBT's are limited while mends can be inflicted endlessly.
---
Where pig can crouch slowly to sneak up on you, he can frenzy to catch up to you to make you need to mend.
---
And as far as blood and tracks not showing in frenzy, spirit can see them but not the survivor wheras Legion can't see them but can see the survivor.
---
So overall he'll be fine. I don't get what the huge fuss is over. Everyone hated playing against legion and these changes eliminate almost all of the issues that made him annoying while buffing his base speed to make him actually able to be an m1 killer and get downs without exploiting the mend bar.
---
Wait so there is a cooldown then? Is it still better at 8 seconds because it makes the cooldown start sooner at 8 seconds instead of 15 or does the cooldown start as soon as it activates?
---
Think the dude is projecting.
---
Ohhh now I know
---
UPDATE: FIRST 4K. CARRY ON
---
Wish more posts like this would reach the front page instead of all the reposted trash memes.
---
*jumps out of bush* **Surprise!**
---
We asked to fix the broken shit, not make him LITERALLY UNPLAYABLE, I mean shit, man.
---
THE OTHER DAY I HAD SOMEONE DO THIS, AFTERWARDS I CALLED THEM OUT AND THEY SAID "HAHAH YOU'RE JUST A STACK TO ME LOOOL" AND I MADE A REDDIT POST SAYING WGLF SHOULD ONLY GIVE STACKS ON SAFE HOOK RESCUES SINCE THERE'S NO REASON TO REWARD HOOK DIVING LIKE THAT, I GOT DOWNVOTED AND YELLED AT. PEOPLE WERE SAYING "FUCK NO IT'S ALREADY TOO HARD TO GET STACKS, QUIT BITCHING"
---
Smart people use it as a last resort. I wish that could be said for everyone but unfortunately, solo queue survivor has to be hell
---
Lmao definitely
---
Ya know, i hate legion and i'm happy for this nerf, but a mindset of thirst on other's tears is very juvenile and desperate
---
SECOND THIS, PIG WITH WHISPERS IS AMAZING. WHEN YOU SPAWN IN, CROUCH, AND HEAD TOWARDS GENS, BUT NOT TOO CLOSE UNLESS WHISPERS GOES OFF, SO YOU CAN TELL RIGHT AWAY WHICH GEN THEY ARE ON
---
*says the one misspelling Michael*
---
GTA and other games don't use a chapter model and when they make a new one, generally they transition to a new engine or change the game drastically. DbD doesn't work on that sort of model
---
Exactly
---
Make legion great again pls
---
Sure you do buddy.

It stays yellow the entire time more than one survivor is on the generator, and the second there is only one survivor on it it goes back to red. The tiers are how often you get the sound notification

You're Ashley God Damn William's you think some punk ass kid in a hoodie and a face mask is gonna take you down?

I JUST BOUGHT THE FUCKING DLC REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Haha nerd
---
I mean they can do something like what Skyrim and Rainbow 6 have done where they release a new texture pack or just add additional features. Most of what you're talking about doesn't necessarily need to involve a second release.

I'm scared of getting matched with someone who's doing this bug because I don't want to get banned by mistake

---
"go figure yourself out you meanie guy vs these poor legions" stfu go back in the closet did holy shit isn't there some guy in a park who's dick you could be sucking?
---
my best advice is every game just take advantage of the hatch get two gens done because the first time i played with my friends they were really bad i pretty much did that every match
---
PERSONALLY I THINK IT SHOULD BE LIKE LEAGUE OF LEGENDS OR CSGO WHERE YOU GET BANNED FOR INTENTIONALLY DC'ING. NOT AN INFINITE LOADING SCREEN, I MEAN ALT+F4 IN GAME, OR CLICKING THE 'LEAVE GAME' BUTTON. FIRST TIME IS 30 MINUTES, NEXT ONE IS 2 HOURS, THEN 24 HOURS, ETC. EVENTUALLY A PERMABAN FOR DOING IT MANY TIMES INTENTIONALLY.
---
I'm really skeptical about the changes but pretty much all of my posts regarding the topic are to be taken with a grain of salt
---
Nice condescension assuming I couldnt tell they were SWF from how they were playing. ( I could :). and I obviously wouldnt mori if they werent.
---
And yes I am going to "attack" everyone in this shitty website for being terrible, that is my freedom. If you take a suggestion that is long LONG fucking overdue, you little shit, and tell me to "get gud" i am gonna vent a little :P.
---
I didnt just see a streamer, I saw 4 people join instantaneously with clear indications of them being SWF, and I saw a flashlight on top of that. The Streamer name was just an extra indication. So I equipped a mori to make them suffer like they make newbs who dont know their opponents have voice coms suffer.
---
And finally, you know how I know you are a completely useless person that I shouldn't give a shit about? Not the fact that you defend people who DC when they see that they are losing. 
---
No, it is the fact that you don't even understand how the game works. Killing people DOES NOT RANK YOU UP. YOU HAVE TO HOOK MULTIPLE TIMES, 9 TO BE PRECISE TO GET THE IRIDESCENT IN THAT CATEGORY (WHICH THEY DONT LET YOU THE MOMENT THEY SEE THEY ARE LOSING THEY JUST SUICIDE ON THE HOOK). FOR 'CHASER' YOU NEED TO CHASE AND INJURE PEOPLE MULTIPLE TIMES NOT JUST SLUG THEM. YOU CANNOT GET GATEKEEPER IF THEY GEN RUSH LIKE LITTLE SHITS WITH THEIR SHROUD OF SPAWNING TOGETHER FROM THE START OF THE GAME. :) You made me press caps.
---
As a killer I am not supposed to kill, I am supposed to play the game and be a 'scary monster' (that a CERTAIN type of survivor groups like to bodyblock and dance around) that injures and hooks you if you get caught twice. But due to cancerous little shits like yourself, and people who support you I am forced to make the game boring for myself and my opponents by playing like this JUST SO I DONT LOSE and I have to get no bloodpoints/fun out of it. Well mostly, I have fun when I ruin their games so I guess it's fine, hence this post.
---
"Keep dodging lobbies" only if I dont have a mori to spare &lt;3 I'd hate to see you keep that purple flashlight
---
Now reverse it üê∑
---
Well I hope I don't run into you in the fog. You'd probably leave the other survivors screwed over by dcing as soon as something you don't like happens
---
I mean, that's a feature not an exploit...

What about the rework to DS without the counterpart rework to NOED?
---
Oh wow you played the new Legion already?
---
Oh shit nvm okay. yea you just lucky then
---
Okay I thought it was a PlayStation thing when I didn‚Äôt see Jeff‚Äôs on the store, but I guess they didn‚Äôt release his yet. I‚Äôll wait a little longer I guess.
---
At this point they should just scrap the power and start over.
---
Maybe they'll actually deliver on the concept that way.
---
if you reported to PSN they'd probably do something about it. i've reported on XBox before and had a fairly swift response, although i don't remember what the punishment was. idk. i get the apathy about reporting. i was awful about rage quitting for awhile when i was super burnt out on this game and now that i've taken a break and come back i'm realising how childish and unfair DCing really is, so it's frustrating to see how many people are seemingly getting away with it with the way the report system works right now.
---
1 - Customizable survivors, as in the choice of gender, face, hairstyle and clothes. This would make each one imersed and unique, thus more enjoyable.
---
2 - A seccond game mode alredy so one don't become stale so soon.
---
Both sides compete for who can use the most bullshit to win. Can't blame it on one side.
---
Me too. Barring the bug/exploit, its better than Nurse. You can actually lose or juke Legion. You will go down, but you can buy enough time to pop a gen or two.
---
Ohhh, damn, I just got whoooshed hard.
---
If my calculations are correct then about 5%.
---
Imagine judging people based on what team they usually play for in a videogame
---
###WAIT UNTIL THE LEGION CHANGES ARE RELEASED ON THE PTB UNTIL YOU START BITCHING THAT THEY'VE BEEN NERFED INTO THE GROUND, JESUS FUCKING CHRIST. I KNOW WE ALL LIKE TO MEME BUT GODDAMN, LEGION ISN'T FUN TO PLAY AS OR AGAINST AS THEY STAND RIGHT NOW! TAKE A FUCKING CHILL PILL.

#SLOW THE GAME DOWN JUST A LITTLE BIT
---
yeah I was kinda surprised too because on the end screen it showed my points for my last match, but then when it listed all the players it showed me having 0 points and still being alive, and in the top right corner i still only had 600 bloodpoints so obviously i got nothing from the match. i play on PS4 so i'm not sure if its different between console and PC.
---
Mori someone as Hillbilly : Me with Lv 1 Hillbilly who still has a Halloween offering in his first bloodwebs ‚Äúnope, throw it away.‚Äù 
---
Hit four survivors with Huntress Axes. ‚ÄúWow fuck me.‚Äù
---
Wrong. BBQ is amazing on its for the aura reading, which turns certain already great Killers such as Billy and Nurse into complete gods. Benefits less mobile characters, too. 
---
But then, there's a 100% bloodpoint bonus to everything. Other killer perks are awful, or nerf you in the case of Distressing, and only give you like 25% or *8%.* The main aspect of the perk is amazing for reasons I don't even need to explain, but that BP bonus forces me to run it on every killer, even if my plan is to insidious in the basement the entire time. 
---
I don't even know why it has a BP bonus, but I'm not complaining.
---
its better to just work on it since it makes you a better player hitting great skillchecks is important
---
you're free to "attack" anyone here you want, but i doubt you'll find anyone who agrees with or supports you. And maybe you should "git gud" if you run away at the slightest hint of a SWF group. Other killers do it, and they find ways to win. 
---
you saw four people join at the same time, so it had to be SWF. you're a fucking moron. do you have any idea how the matchmaking algorithm works? you're telling me, that without viewing the source code or consulting with someone who knows the system in and out, that it is impossible for four (or less) people to join at the same time without it being SWF?  as i previously stated, that's good though, because you dodging lobbies like a bitch is best for the survivors, so they're not subjected to your whining. also, you mentioned in your post "poor solo players i mistake for SWF" sure does sound like you're no that confident if it is a SWF match or not.
---
i never defended anyone who disconnected. re-read my previous statement, and if you still don't get it, go back to school and up your reading comprehension levels. 
---
i barely even had the motivation to read the entire capped paragraph. Perhaps if ranking up is the only motivation for playing the game, you should step away from a bit and determine if the game is fun or not.  Maybe talk to some people in real life and get some fucking perspective.
---
i don't mind losing stuff i bring to the match, it's expected. doesn't bother me in the slightest.
---
dude is such a projectionist he should get a job at the local theatre
---
This seems to be the situation, yeah.
---
I run BBQ when I basement camp as Leatherface, just for that BP bonus. Case closed.
---
As long as you‚Äôre the trapper only your leg will get caught in it. Make sure you choose killer to be immune to the traps otherwise you‚Äôll need luck or a teammate.
---
Killer was P3 nurse we all died
---
who needs hit boxes?
---
Poor BHVR and their dlc sales :/ For real though, most people must have already bought him, only newcomers will benefit or people that really REALLY hated the perk being held hostage and kept themselves from buying the dlc.
---
When a survivor gets hooked after powered gates, but it Claudette
---
I think your English machine broke
---
IF SMALL GAME INCLUDED A TOTEM COUNTER THAT WOULD BE GOOD TOO. SORT OF LIKE HOW HEX: THRILL HAS IT. I DON'T THINK THAT'S ASKING FOR TOO MUCH.
---
Love how you no longer have an argument, so you immediately go to attack a strawman to deflect away from the fact that you are so very, very wrong. I mean, could you get any more cliche in terms of internet argument? 
---
And yeah... god forbid someone come on to the internet and lie about what happened to make themselves feel and look better. It‚Äôs not like that‚Äôs never happened before. No one ever tries to make themselves look better in their posts by omitting information. 
---
And pointing a survivor in a locker is against the rules. Whatever made-up little scenarios you have in your head where you justify yourself doesn‚Äôt change things. It just makes you an idiot that breaks the rules.
---
yeah thats pretty much me when i go against legion
---
A nerf is coming that takes something from literally every aspect of Legion‚Äôs ability. They are easier to spot, they have a harder time finding Survivors, they are now punished for messing up more... the list goes on.
---
They‚Äôre now much harder to play but also weren‚Äôt given much additional reward. All in all, it wasn‚Äôt a balance so much as players were discouraged from picking them.
---
It sucks that the two dc'ed. But I feel bad for the two remaining players. You had two survivors who decided to stick around attempting to play an unfair game with you and you still sacrificed them. The reward for sticking around an unfair game was dying. I'm surprised they didnt dc as well. Not saying you should have let them live or farmed with them, that's entirely your choice. I'm simply saying there are actually decent survivors who dont want to dc and are punished for it. It's just a neverending cycle.
---
I personally think new legion is actually stronger but what do I know I'm only a p3 Legion.
---
I'll just point out that going from 4.4 m/s to 4.6 m/s means that your catchup speed (the relative speed difference between you and the Survivor) goes from 0.4 m/s to 0.6 m/s, which is a 50% increase. 0.2 m/s might not sound like much when thought of as a % of 4.4, but as a % of 0.4, it's huge. :)
---
These are really good!
---
Making it to where frenzy hits do nothing against people already affected with deep wounds basically makes his power pointless. He will also be slower while frenzying and has a nerf which requires the frenzy to fully recharge to use now. And if you ever get juked once and miss, you immediately end your frenzy. And he can't see blood any more. And deep wounds doesn't go down in the terror radius. And Legion can't see the timer. And progress is saved and the timer paused if a survivor stops mending. 
---
I mean the list of nerfs is seriously massive, the only positive change is his movement speed, which only slightly makes up for the fact that Legion is basically an M1 killer now with a power that only punishes survivors that escape Legion in a chase by making them waste 10 seconds to mend.
---
But I don‚Äôt like mint ice cream! 
---
Then WHY did u ask for it!? That dammed scene.. haha
---
This. When the survivors play smart most killers you have to beat them on a loop, either by mind-gaming them, or waiting for them to make a mistake. Most m1 killers have to do this twice. With legion you can waste a lot of survivor time, and you only have to hit them once in a loop.
---
make legion a survivor
---
For Leatherface, no, very poor killer to be worth the money and if you argue the BBQ perk is worth the money then you are saying we are paying money for a single perk, which again is not worth and is asinine.
---
I'm still on board.
---
I hate the entire game play of The Legion so if nerfing him into the dumpster is what it takes for a full rework I'm all for it.
---
i love that game
---
No, it is Brand off, but why on PC tho? 
---
It's Dwearder, Iron Chuckles and stuff
---
claptrap killer WHEN?!
---
The people who liked playing Legion for his agility/speed will drop him after this update, since you're forced to not use your power and pursue as a normal M1 killer.
---
Maybe there's something in the new add ons that will make him usable, but I doubt it.
---
thats a big fml moment
---
That's idiotic. Just quit, don't delete your work. 
---
Quick, someone archive everything.
---
\&gt;picks infinite wisdom
---
\&gt;"damn, I should have taken WGLF stacks"
---
You're a lesser person if you played legion though.
---
On the subject of grind i am pretty sure they have talked about providing something in the future.Even something as simple as getting perks at tier 3 immediately would work, no reason relying on rng so hard to build a brand new character.
---
Ootl...
---
What‚Äôs going on?
---
fuck it noed can stay but mettle? pls get it out of my face
---
I disagree. I think the Shock Therapy does a good job of wasting time, and it prevents flashlight saves and unhooking. If you practice, you can prevent pallet looping with it. Also, it lets you find people really easily through Doctor auras. 
---
Plus, you get a ton of BP.
---
yeah this entire sub is essentially people pissed about the nerf or people flaming the people pissed about the nerf
---
i feel like there shouldnt be a cross hair for clown i think it should how far the bottle goes like the nurse with the addon
---
*shouldn't've*
---
The plague's dark devotion perk would be awesome. Hit any survivor to locate the others, then once you find the obsession you put the terror radius on them. Your power tells you where the other survivors are, and now you have no terror radius. proceed to exit feral frenzy and sneak over to them.  
---
Also Monitor will still be pretty good on him. It works pretty good on most 115% MS killers, and with his feral frenzy speed he will close that distance even faster, so they won't have as much time to hide.
---
You have to be hit that many times? Yeah idk i've never actually ran into it myself. I ran into someone running just the green add on but you have to have both right?
---
It‚Äôs a long running bug as far as I‚Äôm aware
---
I think we did a pretty good job so far.
---
Thanks for the help!
---
I had this happen too. And the killer wasn't even camping or anything either :/
---
Are there enough individual perks at prestige 0 in the base game to get to 50 without having an empty web? Were most all old salt on this subreddit... but what would that do to the new player experience?
---
What about the NOED rework to being a Hex without the counterpart DS rework?
---
I believe both by themselves are glitched and that running both doesn‚Äôt stack, I might be wrong about that though. I know with the purple one it‚Äôs very similar the first two, not sure about the third, but by the 5th it‚Äôs 127 seconds.
---
The counter to camping is doing generators. If your entire squad crawls out of the woodwork to unhook you before I've even *put you on the hook* then obviously I'm not gonna go anywhere.
---
If Survivors didn't want killers to camp, then they wouldn't reward it by feeding additional hits.
---
dbd pre legion: FFS ALL THESE FUCKING LOW RANK BILLYS CHEESING MATCHES, GG NO RRREEEEEEEE
---
Legion release: Wow Legion is so bad, lol new Freddy tier!
---
Last week: FFS ALL THESE FUCKING MOONWALKING LEGION SWEATY CHUNNELERS COME ON BE DO SOMETHING!?!

The day after Legion will be nerfed: FFS ALL THESE FUCKING LOW RANK BILLYS CHEESING MATCHES, GG NO RRREEEEEEEE
---
*Its the ciiiiiiiircle, the cirrrclllleee of liiiiiiife*
---
Well it‚Äôs character xp.
---
Ok....
---
Let's be happy it is finally not held hostage for people to buy Leatherface.
---
People are dumb. I force people to let me heal them. Just gotta be close enough to get the prompt ;)
---
But not all people run. You will see people who stay. Might help to give them a teabag or somethin or wave 'come back' as they run. Maybe even give them the gesture before you save them so they think you want them to follow you
---
If they are so bad you didn;t proove you deserve to rank up. You have to beat better survivors to proove it.
---
Okay I see that you guys need some more time before you can talk about this, we will get through this either by uninstalling or getting good, but we do still need people to clean off chewing gum from under tables and we can't have all you getting depressed here.
---
TUNNELING DOSEN'T EXIST, YALL ARE BEING BITCHES ABOUT WHAT A REAL KILLER WOULD DO
---
Well I was thinking it was like leveling a character. Bloodpoints are xp for characters.
---
sorry whats the point of this comment?
---
Lets take this up a notch. Why isn't there a full blown vs AI mode? It would be so beneficial for both killers and survivors. Killers can practice and get comfortable with their abilities while survivors can take more time to learn the basics of survival.
---
hahahaha! Snowflake? Douchebag identification accepted!
---
Thing is though, when you deeo wound someone and you can't see any other survivor within your terror radius the power is not very good and only used for that first hit.
---
I can‚Äôt beat better survivors if I keep blacking form beating worse survivors
---
oh wow, that actually sounds awesome. good call.
---
but i still prefer bit stealthy. dunno why but i don't do so well with loud bois unless Trapper cause the power is spread without the terror involved.
---
Yes, that;s just the thing. And when you play Meg you're a MegHead xD
---
&gt; Douchebag identification accepted!
---
oh noooooo
---
I honestly thought i was going against the bug becasue my mend time was long but when i saw he was only running one i assumed the add on was just doing it's job but i dont actually know if only one of the add ons works
---
\*nerfed to oblivion
---
A lot of the changes are painful, but you can get where they're coming from.
---
The Deep Wounds changes, however, are just bullshit, since in addition to being massive Legion nerfs they're also massive Borrowed Time buffs.
---
Ignoring how Stabs don't whittle down the timer....
---
* The killer can't see the remaining timer. Why? Why would you deliberately hide information? It was a bad idea for Pig, it was a bad idea for Plague, why would you do it again for Deep Wounds?
---
* It doesn't tick down in the TR. For Legion this is fine (fuck moonwalking lol) but for BT it's annoying as hell. There basically isn't even a timer unless you leave them alone.
---
* It doesn't tick down while mending. Makes sense for Legion, but I still don't like it.
---
Developing AI that can function the way it needs to for dbd would take a stupid amount of time. Chances are it would always just crouch to a corner anytime it hears the terror radius.
---
I've noticed it as survivor along with a lot more dc'ing as killer the last couple of days.
---
Lmao what's the fucking point of your post?
---
Frenzy hits shouldn't do anything to people. Rewarding a killer for using a braindead power is not good for the game. Frenzy was always intended to be a pressure tool made to make survivors mend and waste their time while legion gets to chase another survivor during that time period. If people choose not to heal they risk going against a 115% movement speed killer while basically exposed. The movement speed buff is actually a massive change to legion, as before he couldnt down good survivors that knew how to loop without getting 4 frenzy hits due to being so slow. Whiffing with legion's free hit now actually punishes you, it was really stupid how you could whiff 5 times in a row and get away with it. Legion was never supposed to track people in frenzy, you're basically given a free hit by pressing l2 and using your eyes. If you could actually track people along with that it'd be a stupid power with no room for mind games at all. Many killers dont miss their hits often anyways. That's why bloodhound was used on legion, so they could track people while walking backwards. The deep wounds not going down in terror radius is a necessary change to get rid of the ridiculous moonwalking strategy. One thing that I dont think needed to be changed was his movement speed in frenzy,however the devs haven't specified how much slower frenzy is and the increased duration hopefully cancels out the lack of time legion now has in order to apply deep wounds to everyone.
---
Logically I‚Äôm probably Trapper because I‚Äôve set a bear trap before. Never used a chainsaw though. I‚Äôve also never teleported with the souls of the dead.
---
Well alright sir
---
i hope you are joking lol
---
If I sense a "bully" attempt I will just face camp and let the salt pour in. Its gotta be pretty intense though. If I get flashlighted or looped I dont consider it bullying.
---
Either they assume someone else is going for the save or they simply don't care. Then it turns into a vicious cycle. Bobby plays a match where his teammates let him die on the hook. Bobby is now pissed. He starts his next game with the attitude of "screw my teammates, they dont save me, I wont save them." The cycle continues.
---
Never heard of em.
---
your internet crashed for a second and they all DCed because of it.
---
whats the point of being a prick? im asking why bullying killers is something people enjoy doing, if you‚Äôre not gonna answer the question dont comment. its unnecessary as fuck and , to be honest, no one wanted your input on whether or not you saw a point of a post.
---
They didn't give us what we wanted. We wanted nerfs to Frank's and for them to fix the exploit, most complaints were based around those two things. BHVR fucked up with their knee jerk reaction. No one wants him to be on the extreme ends of the scale, we just want a playable killer with valid counterplay options.
---
And here I am, a Legion main, pumped to try these changes.
---
big brain jane main
---
nah its definitely infinite life. i have so many games in my library, no way i'll finish all of them in one life. oh and grinding all survivors and killers to prestige 3 takes another life's time.
---
i really miss stacking the dark ones with my friends so the killer and us couldnt see shit
---
We had a Dwight who just tiptoed around, not helping with a single gen. Whenever he was chased, he'd bring the killer straight to one of us...sucks
---
yea that stuff isnt rlly bullying, clicky clicky and shit like that is BM, but i dont rlly facecamp i usually just shake my head
---
Yeah, I wouldn't sell the new legion short just yet. The nerfs may be a bit much, but then again it took a while for everyone to figure out about moonwalking and bloodhound + sloppy butcher.
---
Legion main here (Yes, really)
---
This is exactly what he needed. Exactly what I've been asking for. His power was always supposed to be about blitzing multiple survivors in a row, spreading damage quickly. The addition of the Bleedout Timer was only implemented because striking an injured survivor in Frenzy and knocking them to the ground would be incredibly unfair (same reason Exposed doesn't work on Frenzy). The decision to have Frenzy "damage" the timer was a terrible idea too. Deleting the "Frank's Mixtape"-style Legion and upgrading him to 115% is the best possible decision.
---
He is now comparable to Wraith or Pig (dash), whose power allows an easier first hit, but doesn't help within the chase. The difference is, Legion gets to strike multiple survivors, but his power (Unlike Wraith and Pig) won't help you strike an injured survivor to the ground. 
---
This is also comparable to the Plague. Why do you have to Cleanse against her? Because being permanently injured against a 115% killer is something close to suicide. Now, refusing to heal versus the Legion is a death sentence, and his ability to injure people effectively will actually slow the game down ^(just a little bit) the way it was always supposed to.
---
whoops
---
Losing your power when you miss, all he need was regular killer cooldown
---
Cringe, talk less. A LOT less.
---
But they definitly ban dcer ....for sure 1009% /s
---
He'd be better, but he wouldn't be good. He'd still be one of the worst killers. I read the other reply too, and I don't know man, I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree. I think the impact of getting a free hit on survivors isn't really that big when you have very little you can do in a chase as the killer to counteract pallet looping outside of that free hit. Just like with freddy, he can most of the time get a free hit, but after that he just gets looped, and looped, and looped, for so long that he most of the time loses 3 kills. 
---
I disagree with your idea that he's stronger than wraith, bubba, and hag in a chase. Wraith gets windstorm, bubba can break pallets faster, hag can mindgame with traps or deter making another loop with her traps. Legion will now have to...break the pallet and keep chasing. And doing that the entire game will make you lose. It happens to freddy, every. single. game.
---
In the "Halloween" movie, Michael is credited as the Shape, in the game he's listed as the Shape, yet nobody called him The Shape.
---
Dunno mang
---
you're not bad just 'cause you arent in swf. Experienced solo players never acknowledge Freddy as an okay killer when he was released.
---
And if they would release the old Freddy version today it will be the same.
---
being balanced is one thing, being not stupidly boring to play against as a solo player is something else.
---
You're one pathetic loser
---
The difference is legion was actually broken and had no counters.
---
he should speak with Gorb.
---
A bullet strikes you in the chest killing you immediately.  You go to hug your dog and accidently obliterates it.  You pick up your spoon, you had a spoon.
---
Obviously it would take a lot of time. There is almost nothing in this game that the devs can do overnight. Saying it takes a lot of time is poor excuse to why we can't get new content and QoL changes. Everything takes time. That doesn't mean it isn't something that the devs can't consider in the future when they have more resources at their disposal.
---
is it available?
---
I‚Äôve never reported a YouTube video for just being bad. You‚Äôre making it really hard man.
---
Last longer but be slower. I'm glad I can run for a longer amount of time...with a broken leg. Nurse also doesn't lose scratch marks during her fatigue.
---
As are sounds and scratch marks :)
---
BRUH JUST BURN EBONY MORI AND WATCH THE WORLD BURN, THE MOST ZEN SHIT EVER
---
**/*cries in empathy
---
Never DC'd before, usually on a Legion game there's 2 DC's and they farm with me. Such a fun and rewarding experience.
---
Unnerving Prescence, Thanataphobia, A nurse's Calling, and Hex:Huntress' Lullaby sounds like a good meme'ing build. Any perk that increases problems within terror radius to go with the rare add-on that fills the whole map with it sounds fun.
---
Bc his power is useless against good survivors. He's an m1 killer 99% of the time, his chainsaw is too slow to catch up to anyone unless you're breathing down their necks.
---
I'm sure someone will figure it out quickly, but it takes time to spread around. I didn't notice many people using those strategies on Legion until he had been out for a while.
---
THE UPDATE DIDN'T HELP THEY STILL SPAWN RIGHT THERE THEY CAN HEAR IT BEHAVIOR PLEASE HELP
---
&gt; He essentially works like Amanda now.
---
So, he's essentially a terrible killer now, which is what everyone is saying.
---
&gt; Instead of wasting their time with RBT's, he wastes them with mend
---
&gt; he can frenzy to catch up to you to make you need to mend.
---
You keep talking as if mend is some huge "obstacle" that wastes ungodly amounts of time.  It really isn't.  Not to mention, this "obstacle" only applies to people to escape Legion.  It does nothing if you get downed.
---
While you could argue that "Oh, just use Frenzy on multiple people", yeah, no.  Most survivors scatter when they see Legion charging at them.  It's pretty hard to gauge how far someone is with that pulsing notification after applying Deep Wounds.  Most of the time you end up chasing after someone you have no hope of catching.
---
&gt; spirit can see them but not the survivor where as Legion can't see them but can see the survivor.
---
Yeah, but Spirit can also use her power to end chases, or mind game.  Once Legion hits someone, all he can do is chase them down, which is precisely what makes Wraith and Pig so weak.
---
I'll trade you. I'm sick of rolling killer dailies when I just wanna relax and play survivor. Only one I've gotten all week is a sabo ritual.
---
Did you say for honor? Oh nah
---
It wouldn't really matter if you got the perks early and had the bloddweb be "empty", i for one HATE leveling a brand new dlc killer/survivor and not getting the 1-2 perks i really wanted or get them only in level 1 form while the rng just points the middle finger. As for new players, yeah it might feel too quick getting all the perks they have available, but we are looking at the long term effect, cause when those people start getting teachables (even with the base characters and no dlc), then every new character they start the grind just doubles, and for survivors this is especially painful due to their horrible BP gains.
---
THERE IS NO TUNNELING, ONLY IDIOT SURVIVORS
---
haha yes 1 good perk what a great shrine.
---
A) Always Private Profile.  
---
B) Don't advertise that I'm streaming.  
---
I'll tell you afterwards that I'm steaming so you can feel extra humiliated then :)
---
maybe I will consider playing again, \*loads into game with only 2 other survivors\* yeah fuck this game
---
It wouldn't be worth the time.
---
The time is better spent on the actual game itself. They can't even fix que times after how many years now?
---
I just use a program  for it lmao. There is no reason for an add-on that shows how it'll arc, it's not that complicated, just the center-point is important.
---
My bad!
---
I didn't even try
---
Man i remember the last time it was on the shrine, best day ever
---
I'm inclined to agree. I survive to game with friends, kill to get BP. The grind is a problem as it stands now.
---
&gt;with a power that only punishes survivors that escape Legion in a chase by making them waste 10 seconds to mend.
---
...and wounding the survivor, ie free first hit. 
---
...and the ability to wound multiple survivors in quick succession with frenzy stacks. 
---
...and the ability to see any healthy survivor in your (now larger) terror radius.
---
i mean i'm not saying he's going to be some super viable killer, but he's definitely not going to be ass bad as some of the other M1 killers.
---
Being 115% speed, survivors will actually want to heal when playing against Legion now, which wastes extra time on top of mending, so if you bring a nice set of add-ons you can stall the game a lot more than other m1 killers.
---
Wait what? Are you serious? His channel was pure gold
---
That‚Äôs not even what I meant. They literally launched Mount Ormond after PTB players told them it was a glitchy mess that didn‚Äôt work. Since they didn‚Äôt fix it, Mount Ormond was still a glitchy mess that didn‚Äôt work and they had to pull it after the Chapter Launch and spend a few weeks fixing it anyways before rereleasing it. That‚Äôs how little attention they paid to the PTB feedback.
---
Moonwalking Legion was nowhere near as frequent but they knew about the exploit from early PTB feedback and just figured it wasn‚Äôt worth taking the time to fix the exploit (whereas if they had, the Legion stuff likely wouldn‚Äôt have blown up quite as much as it did). 
---
Closing the hatch instantly activated both exit gates. It‚Äôs not like they had to go do every remaining generator lol. That would make it more challenging but not impossible if a survivor was very cautious.
---
&gt; you are literally one of the only people who thinks Clown is bad. dare I say that has more to do with you as a player/your playstyle than Clown as a killer?
---
Nope Clown is just shit. People do well with Clown and think hes good because they face idiot survivors who try to loop him.
---
&gt; Freddy's been memed to death but it is true that he cannot play as reactively as other killers and has to wait to start punishing survivors. his tracking and stall go away after one botched skillcheck and that's not even mentioning the Freddy jank where he can be stunned before he is fully visible to you
---
7 seconds can be mindgamed, the stall and tracking you get is super good with how easy it is to apply, and mindgame the transition, use the time when you are invisible to switch directions.
---
something similar but freddy couldn't be exploited with things like running backwards or 5 minutes gens
---
...then why do people play all of the other first hit killers?
---
because they're fun and bring variety to the game. not everything has to be "play the best killer" because then why aren't you just a nurse main
---
Yes they did. Most of the changes have been requested multiple times but different kind of people.
---
Welp I disagree heavily with Trapper, Plague, Spirit and Freddy placements.
---
is it available ?
---
idk, the only times I leave someone to die is if they go self-care in a corner of the map, urban evade and do nothing or waste the god-pallet. Dogshit players are nothing but WGLF-stacks.
---
But in normal scenarios where you arent being a burden to your team it's just them being idiots and/or pussies.
---
Wasn't he being a good killer the reason people wanted him nerfed?
---
WASNT SURE IT WAS 6 OR 7 SO I JUST WENT WITH 6 SO THE HIVEMIND WOULDNT ATTACK ME LOL
---
Nope I'm not kidding,  he put out a video yesterday and said goodbye and after sometime he deleted his channel
---
Legion was DOA and was supported by strings. It would take careful planning and a lot of care to balance this killer with their core power without admitting defeat and making a new power. I hope Freddy does get that care, but only the reveal of his new power will tell.
---
All they had to do was not allow the addons to stack lol
---
Maybe that's the point, he's supposed to be up close and personal.
---
Legion Mains: B u t  w h y  d i d  t h e y  n e r f  m y  m a i n ?
---
ok
---
I don‚Äôt think so, but I haven‚Äôt gotten to test him yet. He still gets first hit free and now he has 115% movement speed, so chases will still be shorter than the average killer, just not as frustrating
---
dunno what that is
---
WHY THE FUCK YOU NERF THE LEGION
---
Ah okay that makes sense. So the blade is meant to increase mend time every time you're hit? or that's the part that's bugged?
---
When rank rewards are added, dcs should happen less often.
---
yup, by making Legion unplayable bullshit.
---
The filthy blade add-ons, specifically the ones that increase mending time. Each time you hit a survivor with Frenzy, the timer increases for mending for up to 5 minutes, not even kidding. This is unintentional of course.
---
i really wish they would get rid of the specific dailys and make them more generalized so you dont have to play people u dont have shit on its just a bad time
---
Legions power will be practically useless, since there is zero tracking when using it. Deep Wounds won't help anymore. You need to wait till Feral Frenzy is fully charged to use it. Hitting someone during Feral Frenzy makes am easy escape for survivors since they get a speed boost from the hit, and there is no tracking during Frenzy which makes it hard to follow. If you miss a hit in Frenzy, you lose Frenzy which makes it easy to lose a survivor due to the stun you suffer.
---
Freddy at least has aura reading and a real way to slow the game down with his ability. Legion just gives you a poke and then proceeds to lose you since he can't track you.
---
Everyone's all "the community is all killer mains" or "the community is all survivor mains" and treats the community as if it's one collective conscience and criticize it for it. Then, when the community is shown to have differing opinions, people criticize that.
---
what's the point of not just playing nurse cuz she does everything better than every other killer?
---
down to my flair xD

It's probably due to the toll capitalism is having on games. They're pretty much all slot machines by this point, or microtransaction hells. Game creators are making it harder and harder to enjoy the games they put out, and even indie developers aren't immune to it. Everyone's life is getting harder and it's becoming harder to afford things in an increasingly saturated market with maximum competition, and ad revenue has bottomed out. Most of these gamers have to work two jobs and their regular job sucks too because they haven't gotten a raise in years or a quality of life increase. There's no trade union representation, a single company called Google and/or Amazon controls every aspect of their life, and they have no foreseeable future. Even popular streamers like GTLive are suffering because they've had millions stolen from them and no way to get it back in this system of classical/neoliberal values that prizes copyright and wage theft over rights to life, liberty, happiness, jobs.
---
Gosh, I wonder why gamers, especially streamers are becoming more depressed.

Just bring a toolbox into a game and take down however many hooks you need. It feels shitty, but it goes by pretty quicker.
---
GIT GUD XDDDDDDDDDDDDD
---
I'M NOT SAYING YOU'RE STUPID FOR NOT KNOWING THE GAMERULES BTW, THE IDIOT THING WAS JUST A THING MY DRUNK MIND ASKED ME TO INCLUDE
---
wow sorry man ;D
---
Legion was meh if you played non scummy, and absolutely fucked with frank's mixtape, unbearable with the moonwalking shit, and now the kneecaps are being destroyed lmao
---
This is just another thing we are waiting for to be impletemented one day. It is pure RNG. I suggest you not to buy perks that you don't need just to have them
---
Lol holy fuck then stop playing. Why are you on a dead by daylight Reddit if you have this much animosity towards the game.
---
Because it's not a must have perk. It might be one of the most used, but it's basically a crutch perk for people that don't want to rely on awareness of their surroundings. They can just use a medkit for the cases where people won't heal them.
---
Just because it's one of the most used doesn't mean people should be using it once they learn to play the game better. I remember there being a poll a while back where Spine Chill was one of the most used perks lol, and the same applies to that.
---
No way. She‚Äôs already OP man. The idea is to learn her mechanics. Her current speed is fine.
---
What about the basement Bubba strat
---
turns out you can nerf something too much, as we've all seen before
---
I know. Saboing is so much easier since the buff that made brown toolboxes last four years. It's just that it's a super low payout of 20k bloodpoints. Any survivor daily is good for me, just no more dailies for M1 killers.
---
Umm... read Herman‚Äôs bio.
---
About as valid as genrushing
---
This is the outfit Ash had when he was at the mental institution.
---
Which jacket are you looking into? I've been looking for one too
---
From a strategy standpoint yes, but you gotta understand bad manners. That survivor can't do anything about it. Shitting on the kitchen table is a good way to get guests to leave, but i'm sure you will find a more polite way to do it
---
Imagine derailing an entire thread over a word
---
HEY! YOU! YEAH YOU! THE HUNTRESS IN THE MATCH I WAS JUST IN! HERE'S A TIP FROM GOOD OL' ME. GO FUCK YOURSELF, BECAUSE YOU STOOD THERE, AND GUARDED THE HOOK I WAS ON. ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS?! WHO DOES THAT UNLESS YOU'VE PLAYED THIS GAME FOR ALL OF 1 FUCKING MINUTE!? YOU EVEN LOSE POINTS FOR DOING IT! HOW TOXIC COULD YOU FUCKING BE?! OR ARE YOU JUST THAT INCOMPETENT!? I'D SAY THIS TO YOUR FUCKING FACE IF YOU DIDN'T COWER BEHIND A BLANK STEAM PROFILE WITH, SURPRISE SURPRISE, SOME SCUM YOUTUBER FOR A PROFILE PICTURE. I HOPE YOU CHOKE ON THOSE DAMN AXES COS IF THE TABLES ARE EVER TURNED I SWEAR TO GOD YOU'RE GONNA BE HOOKED MORE TIMES THAN AN ADDICT, CAPICHE?!
---
Tbh survivors and killers below the threshold rank (is it 15?) shouldn‚Äôt be able to encounter or play as non base killers so they can learn the game without all these funky mechanics.
---
All those things wont even be necessarily true anymore. The first hit isnt guarenteed because Legion is both slower in frenzy and immediately gets stunned if the survivor ever jukes well and makes him whiff. Wounding multiple people will also be much less likely because of the reduced frenzy speed (a lot more time taken to get to the other survivors, more likely to have frenzy end) seeing survivors extremely far away with frenzy isnt a good thing because it will never be worth ending chase to go towards someone 30+ meters away.
---
This community defines "tiers" and "good killers" in a really inconsistent manner.
---
I've heard people say Doctor is low tier, I've heard other people say Doc is mid tier, some people say Legion is mid tier, while others argue that Legion has always been a shitty killer who is worse than Freddy and needed fundamental buffs to their kit, and then, I've heard others say they're overpowered and broken.
---
I don't think anyone should be rating killers by how powerful they are, they should be rating them by how fun they are to fight against and play as. 
---
There was just, a general agreement that Legion wasn't fun to play as, nor were they fun to play against, so they got changed to a more active toolset, their abilities actually do something to make him compete with other killers in a manner that is pretty much solely unique to them, but also makes them even, I'm pretty sure with this big ass "nerf", Legion will become a jack-of-all-trades killer who can be built for things like quick gen patrols (with his feral fury sprint), and delaying gens while whittling down survivors slowly until they're dead (with the deep wounds mechanic), both of these are cool ways to play that killers like Wraith have access to with their addons, and other killers, like Nurse and Hillbilly or Doctor and Plague, have built into their toolset with their M2.
---
Not to mention, you can no longer spam swings and still get survivors, their fucking M2 now changes the entire chase around by forcing both Legion and the survivor they're against into a game of timing and prediction. 
---
If Legion misses their swing? Their entire frenzy stops. If the survivor doesn't juke Legion, or doesn't run for a pallet to stun them with? They get hit, which stops generator progress for a decently long time since they now have to mend, I personally think this is awesome, it's not as one-sided as, say, Nurse completely ignoring windows and pallets, or Myers just getting a temporary insta-down. 
---
Legion now has PROPER mind games in how they work, only skill, and knowledge of who you're playing against can really turn the tides, so honestly? Yeah, I'm pretty happy with this.
---
Thanks anyways but I stole that quote myself from Frank something who was super active here 2 years ago when Freddy got nerfed xD
---
Yogurt!
---
"Please validate my tunneling Reddit."
---
grey and black spray paint now. gj
---
It's a bugged Corrupt intervention (Plague perk)
---
You don't see what the fuss is over because you don't play killer.
---
RBTs are put on survivors that are already downed, that you're about to hook. That means that not only are they not doing gens while they're getting the RBT off their head, at least one other survivor stops doing gens to go get the unhook. Mending doesn't waste half as much time as a RBT does 
---
Pig has no TR to get the first hit, and Spirit is invis for the first hit. Legion has a full size TR the entire game, *and* is fully visible. There's no comparison
---
I personally didn't see it coming.
---
What do you mean?
---
i shit my pants everytime i see this bug
---
I dislike doc more than I dislike playing against legion. Don't hate you for playing him, it's an option so it's cool.
---
Susie was my BP farm too :(
---
How??
---
BRUH JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE IS A NEWBIE DOESN'T MEAN HE'S A NOOB, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
---
I dont get mad at BM because to be fair i am trying to kill them and thats kinda rude
---
Maybe it will replenish the power bar. Who knows.
---
Still, I‚Äôve seen a lot of people recently who absolutely believe legion was OP even without Franks and the exploit, so you can‚Äôt pretend BHVR is coming out of nowhere with this
---
Plague has a slow after she ends her vomit aswell, and with 115 speed, legion's fatigue won't hold them back quite as much as it did, I feel like it evens out overall.
---
I mean i know you're kinda being a bit sarcastic but i'm gonna go ahead and give you this list anyway:
---
Hag buffed a few patches ago, trapper buffed a few patches ago, wraith buffed a few patches ago, Prove thyself buffed recently, Pig buffed recently, Spirit had been buffed after release, empathy lithe alert OoO buffed. I can probably name a lot of things that have been nerfed too but the point is BHVR gets things done slow but they get it done as soon as they can. IMO a legion rework will happen, it might take awhile but this is just a temporary band aid to an annoying ass killer
---
I dont think its the fog as Temple of Sicki Girl also has weak auras
---
&gt;Shitting on the kitchen table is a good way to get guests to leave
---
Upvoting for that comment alone lol
---
Trying to be cocky and shaking his head. You played yourself.
---
Will this be changed as well for PS4? Ive heard that achievements can be changed on Xbox but PS4 wont allow it? Wanna make sure its not impossible to get this one on PS4 before the update goes live!
---
I felt like with some perks like Franklins and how his power worked made him so annoying to play against. I loved playing legion for awhile but the games lasted so long because the power simply didn‚Äôt allow for me to focus on one person unless I tunneled them and I just felt plain bad for that. I hope the changes are better in the game than how they sounded when I read them at least.
---
That‚Äôs stupid. Like honestly dude.
---
i dont think you should get your bp back but dont let that keep you from playing and if you got all the way to p3 lvl 50 you should have several other killers ranked up try one of them out as for your cosmetics thats a riparoni just hang in there they might give him a buff after they test out the new changes
---
&lt;3
---
Of course I thought I did but I just did it
---
Slugging means leaving someone on the ground because you see someone else and you want to apply more pressure.
---
If after you downed everyone you don't hook them you are just being a dick.
---
I believe that‚Äôs the bugged part as the description implies a flat gain in mend time, not an increase each mend.
---
Don‚Äôt blame the horse &lt;/3
---
anyone else wanna poke that horse in its 3rd eye
---
THIS IS TRUE. HOWEVER, HE WAS A NEWBIE AND SALTY AF ABOUT IT
---
They definitely went overboard with nerfs, but I'd be surprised if all of them went to live.
---
This isn‚Äôt an unpopular opinion. 
---
Legion as a baseline killer is very weak.
---
I don't really have a problem with slugging as a tactic, but currently it enables a killer to both win and de-rank at the same time. If you are killing all of the survivors, you should be climbing ranks.
---
People were complaining that Legion can moonwalk them (fixed now), that he can miss several hits and not get punished for it (in fact you can use them to gain distance), that got fixed too.
---
And finally, people complained that there isn't any counterplay to him in chase, which also got fixed now. Sounds like they are listening to feedback.
---
interesting. Thanks for your comments. It's nice to learn stuff :D
---
It's like the old joke in the movies where someone's talking to a guy holding something important and goes "Put it down!" and the other guy holding just says "Okay" and fucking spikes it like he just won the superbowl
---
Lol does anyone ever think that maybe some of these defending the Legion nerf are survivor mains? lol. Don't roast me please I already get burned enough playing as killer lol.
---
I don‚Äôt know what bbq is. Can somebody explain please?
---
... yeah 2 years later just like Freddy :(
---
Wouldn't use the term skill but more of "ive been around the block" when players call me a noob...
---
^ This.
---
Someone complaining about BBQ in the shrine not being good enough... This is definitive proof the dbd community can't be satisfied.
---
I have like 2500 shards so I do have enough ty.
---
No, I know, my hearing is crap, the title just illustrated the situation
---
He's a pretty fun killer, and he's pretty popular judging from how many Bubbas I go against when I play killer.
---
The killer doesn't have to be top tier to be fun to play. I have a lot of fun playing him.
---
‚ÄúPerfectly balanced as all things should be.‚Äù

while i can agree that i think he was weak before he was still  unfun to play against i just wish they would of fixed his exploits and a slight nerf but they burned him at the stake
---
If you hate the game so much, why are you on the game's subreddit.
---
I mean. 
---
BBQ being in the shrine is literally useless to anyone who owns BBQ.
---
Yea dude, i dont know why. but he seemed like a good guy, Rest easy gen jake
---
Seriously, all these smug memes are completely missing the point. Almost nobody thought Legion was OP, just poorly designed and unfun. It's like if BHVR responded to criticism about Freddy by nerfing him into the ground, it's the opposite of what we wanted.
---
THEN HE DESERVES THE "GIT GUD"
---
BARBECUE AND CHILI IS ON THE SHRINE OF SECRETS, FUCK YEAH RAGE WEDNESDAY
---
the terror radius had to happen though, and should never of not been on him in the first place. Legion moonwalking after people is the dumbest fucking thing.
---
That said, I'm surprised they didn't just start with that and see how it played out.
---
Yes I'm aware, but the comment I replied to suggested they at least make Mending count as healing so that A Nurse's Calling would work on Legion to at least give him *some* use out of injuring everyone and them having to heal constantly. Thanatophobia is already pretty good, but honestly I feel like it's numbers could use a slight buff? (Maybe that's just me though; it feels like it's pretty okay when it works, but it could be better without being too strong.)

In theory, but as much as the devs don't want 5 rushed gens and scoot out the gate, they also don't want 4 quick kills and the game to be over. 
---
We all kind of have to work together to progress... which is... bizarre.
---
I have half the killers P3Lvl50, I don‚Äôt main Legion i just think it sucks that i put a lot of time, blood points, &amp; money into him just for him to be unplayable.
---
This is such a nonsensical argument. It makes complete sense to get a person out of the match if the team is banging out gens. That's not like button mashing
---
You are right about crouching, I forgot about that one since I don't do that in chase very often. :D
---
Imagine necroposting
---
I admit I love playing legion, and I believe that while the changes sound horrible, it's too early to judge. For all we know it could be good.
---
Still waiting for them to add skill checks to mending though

in the climax the students sing a song and one of them raps about god and the line is are yo down with G O D so when you typed down with O P P in my head it was set to the song in the films climax

---
Let's do it; I'll even throw in a nude of Peter Dinklage if you've got some Huntress or Doctor Rite Rituals ;)
---
Well people WILL quit if they are playing against something OP or unbalanced. It's not worth playing if you know you're going to lose and can't do anything about it. It's the same with when people get camped, farmed, etc. They lost to something they couldn't even do anything about.
---
Quitters should be punished, but not until all the uncounterable bullshit gets nerfed first.
---
It's one of my favorite perks to use when I'm playing with friends. Otherwise, it's basically useless. Hell...I've been unhooked so many times by people who have it just for them to run away from me when I'm crouching under the hook waiting for them to heal me.
---
do duplicate perks appear in the bloodweb? i always buy the better of the two at higher levels, especially if it is a tier 3, that way (i hope) it doesn't show up again.
---
Im actually quite excited to play him in this new state since i love 115% move speed, plus his ability to vault pallets and stuff make chases fun. Plus he may be able to just insta down like plague by canceling frenzy. We'll only know how good it is when we get to test it in the PTR with the new add on changes
---
Lol just got it for DBD on PC after playing it only on console. First killer I leveled was leatherface. But honestly it took me two nights to get him to level 40. Sucks tho, had almost all the killer perks on Xbox :( back to the grind..... Tho in a week I'm done with leatherface, doctor, and hag.
---
They wanted his power to force them to mend. When people only use it to down them or moon walk the survivor it breaks them game. I love this update because I'll be able to play him without being called trash and getting 4 dc's as the match starts.
---
He was awful, but his mechanics were uncounterable and boring to play against.
---
i agree a rework would of been better i feel like the nerfs are just a bandaid to the real problems people were having with him
---
This is what I am getting at though. We punish slugging killers by stopping them from ranking up, but all this does is shove them down onto the low rank survivors. This just hurts the low rank survivors.
---
You can't "whittle them down" because Frenzy hits don't do anything if they already have deep wounds. All the update did was make them move fast while taking away tools. If you could see the progress bar that would add a skill exclusive to legion. As it is they're just going to be a worse version of killers we already have.
---
Does anyone remember when WGLF gave 200%.
---
Ok, but once you down everyone you hook them. Slugging doesn't require you to let the bleed out.
---
You sure do love going on about totems, lol. But okay, survivors who just jump on gens and ignore everything else in the game are as strategic as tunnelling killers. Happy?
---
Uncounterable bullshit?
---
Broooooooooooo thats what im saying. Niggas are on Legions dick/clit because they got nerfed bad
---
So you're saying it would be 4 v 4? 4 killers and 4 survivors?

It was before that change

Maybe, I do think it is the fog setup as to me it looks like the auras are drawn correctly but the fog is drawn over them so they appear white and faint. I wouldn't know about temple though, it hardly appears for me.
---
The seller 'Wantdo' on Amazon has a pretty good looking one that's around $70, two options say black, Black (heavy) and Black (light). The weird thing is I can't tell what they mean, the pictures are the same and so are the item weights. I wanted to order the Light so I could wear it in warmer weather without sweating up a storm and so its not too baggy, but that's the one that's been unavailable since like the beginning of January. I'll either take my chances with the heavy one or look for a different jacket altogether, but this one looks great tbh.
---
Looking back on this u/TheReal-Donut. You were pretty grumpy. It wouldn't of killed you to have lightened up a little and not taken it so seriously. Just saying.
---
At least with nurse you have to be good at the game.You could literally give someone with less than 10 hrs on the game legion and they would find more success than most other killers.

so true but while I had it with most of my killers for a very long time i know a lot of community has thousands of post about keeping there fingercross for this perk for a months on end to pop up in the strine
---
i believe there already one dude
---
I d/c‚Äôd whenever I saw him cuz I never enjoyed playing against him.
---
I‚Äôm quite confused as to why people always harp about Trapper being bad, I play Trapper a lot and get 4ks nearly all of the time.
---
eh, I just created this to test things as Well, I'll try and find it
---
Bitch I'm a killer main, and almost never play survivor. When I do play survivor, and face a legion. They are never a problem, he's just annoying but 10/10 would rather face a legion than a nurse or billy. People who disconnect are fucking faggots.
---
I actually really love the rework, it's a much more balanced, less frustrating killer now for killers and survivors (albeit more so survivors) and actually requires skill now instead of just running
---
It can give you a key for a free escape at 40% gen completion. It grants you maps, it grants you flash lights, and tool boxes, and health kits. They give you stuff to help you win the match. The chest can only be used once.
---
Totems can only be used once as well giving you something good until it is destroyed.
---
The only speed boost totem is NOED that's 1.
---
2nd it only activates at the end of the match and is not usable all game unlike chests and survivors perks.
---
I never DC‚Äôd but I wanted to hang myself the whole match
---
The changes to being brought out of the power on a miss is to stop the second exploit with him. While in frenzy if he spans m1 he still net gains distance because of how lunge mechanics work. Be forcing him out and waiting for the full charge is the only reliable way to stop that exploit.
---
i feel like i know this movie what is it
---
Correct. It shows graphically that you lost 3 pips but if you restart the game, you don't actually lose any at all.
---
  Nurse is a chick
---
MAN I'M ACTUALLY REALLY MAD AT THE LEGION CHANGES.  I LOVED THE RUNNING REALLY FAST AND STABBING THE SHIT OUT OF EVERYONE ASPECT OF THEM AND NOW THAT'S BECOMING A LOT WEAKER.  I WAS REALLY EXCITED TO SEE WHAT THEY WOULD DO WITH THEM FOR THE CHANGES TO MAKE THEM MORE INTERACTIVE TO PLAY AS AND AGAINST, BUT THEY JUST MADE HIM MORE BORING.  I'M STILL GOING TO TRY PLAYING THEM AND HOLDING OUT A BIT OF HOPE THAT THEY'RE NOT TRASH, BUT THEY JUST SEEM LIKE BASICALLY A WORSE WRAITH OR TRAPPER OR ANY OTHER M1 KILLER
---
WE'LL SEE WHEN THE CHANGES GO LIVE
---
I'm a survivor main who occasionally plays killer. I was playing SWF with my friends last night and a killer tunneled me from the very beginning. While he was tunneling me the other survivors were getting gens done. In the time it took me to get chased and hooked twice they had four gens done. We all got out because the killer only focused on me. I do get tunneling as a killer. Sometimes I've even done it. But it typically hurts the killer in the long run. You're giving the other people free time to work on gens.
---
Seeing the comments here regarding this makes me so happy that these folks don't balance this game. Players of any game are notoriously bad at balancing, but this sub really goes all in.
---
The Princess Bride
---
This is true, but again, the time spent mending might be a hint as to what kind of playstyle they might want Legion to have, it seems weird, but, having a killer that switches from putting people into a vulnerable state that forces them to either stay still in a corner, or constantly engage with the killer's presence, is actually an interesting mixture. 
---
Again, the fact they can play two playstyles at once in that unique way already makes them significantly powerful, the fact they can switch from "deep wounds" mode to a proper, normal chase mode, while still forcing everyone else to NOT work on gens, is what makes them powerful, it's a very powerful delay, with decent counter-play, but not TOO much that it would be useless, like Wraith's invisibility.
---
The dude is allowed to say what applies to him. 
---
If he has BBQ, the rest of the shrine is awful
---
 Lmao, what's the point of using his ability then? Sure, you hit them, but then what? You can't see the bleedout timer, it pauses while they mend and while inside your terror radius so absolutely no pressure added at all, and they can mend in 12 sec without Legion add-ons. You can't even see blood pools anymore, what the hell is the point of even using Legion now?
---
There is absolutely no reason to use his ability, since there are more cons than pros. 115% speed is enough? So it's fair to absolutely nerf the poor bugger to the point that his UNIQUE ABILITY itself is fucking useless just because he now has 115% movement speed? I do agree that some nerfs were warranted, but c'mon, all those nerfs combined are just overkill.
---
i guess not sksk
---
Is it the "Men's Windbreaker PU Leather Jacket with Removable Hood"
---
[I‚Äôm sorry little one](https://imgur.com/gallery/PZumxXV)
---
I guess they just hate to be the guy it happens to. I think it's fair as well and expect it when I get downed after gens are done.
---
Big oof
---
This is what I'm sayin!
---
Agreed til the end, then you lost all credibility.
---
I guess "lol" means nothing
---
You‚Äôre not wrong, once gens are finished the killer has no objective other than that hooked survivor 
---
You could argue guarding doors, but with how quickly they open and the inability to regress them there‚Äôs really no point
---
Fugg
---
Like I give a fuck about internet rep. Killer mains are whiny and dumb in general and I'll say it as it pleases me.
---
Nah it does function. It's got it's ups and downs but there is no way to fully balance such an unique game like DBD.
---
The whole game relies on the Matchmaking system, which in turn relies on the Ranking system. I can't possibly think of any way to rework the ranking system to make it fair for both Killers and Survivors, while keeping it also accurate.
---
You would have to take into count every single killer and survivor, their abilities and perks, and different play styles. Not to mention SWF.
---
This whole game would pretty much have to be reworked to implement a fully functioning, fair and accurate ranking system.
---
Because of the huge diversity of every character's abilities, it's not possible. Dead By Daylight isn't really meant to be a overly competitive, *sweat your balls off and smash your keyboard* type of game anyway.
---
From my experience a Legion usually whacks more than 1 person pretty often so that shouldn't matter.
---
People who disconnect are cunts in any game, there is no justification for it and if you do it fuck you
---
They probably only have the rights to the Stars series and couldn‚Äôt get the rights to Army just like the show couldn‚Äôt for a period of time.
---
It‚Äôs pistachio, you uncultured animal
---
That is correct, im admitting that im to lazy to find a template and mods are gay
---
Imagine being this nosey Nelly white knight in life. I'd be embarrassed.
---
Why? Dcers ruin the experience
---
He's slower after the patch. And has a bigger terror radius. It will most certainly matter

&gt;It can give you a key for a free escape at 40% gen completion. It grants you maps, it grants you flash lights, and tool boxes, and health kits.
---
They will grant you A flashlight, A key, A medkit, A map, or A toolbox. And they will grant any ONE of these items to ONE Survivior. 
---
&gt;They give you stuff to help you win the match. The chest can only be used once. Totems can only be used once as well giving you something good until it is destroyed.
---
Totems can be used all match dude. Ever heard of Ruin? Pretty sure it doesn't trigger once and then auto suicide after that one is. 
---
Or Devour hope? When ur fast as fuck after hooking a Survivior and insta downing and Mori'ing every Survivior you touch, that shit doesn't let you do it once and then auto suicide. Surviviors have to destroy it. 
---
&gt;The only speed boost totem is NOED that's 1. 2nd it only activates at the end of the match and is not usable all game unlike chests and survivors perks.
---
There are Survivior perks that don't trigger until endgame either. Hope, Adrenaline, etc. Are killer perks suddenly the only perks that sometimes wait till endgame? Also, chests like I said have a 1 time use that only helps 1 Survivior. There's no such thing as a chest spawning 4 hatch keys.

Where is this from?

Yeah. I agree. I wish they would focus on balancing perks a bit better and more on each side. And I‚Äôm glad they listen to people just wish they would listen to survivors more
---
I mean bubba isnt that bad :(
---
I‚Äôm gonna have to disagree. Devs never listen to siege complaints
---
The moonwalking was a bug. It shouldn't be what we base Legion off of, it wasn't even meant to exist.
---
Pig doesn‚Äôt get that much hate?
---
10/10 would sabatoge
---
The one I've had my eye on was the "Men's Faux Leather Jacket with Removable Hood," but the one you listed is practically the same thing. I just thought the one I found was a little slimmer and more fitted, and had pockets and zippers that match the mirror teaser image (one of the first and best reference pictures I had to work off of to find the best jacket). Either one would do fine realistically.
---
Seems kinda patronising or passive-aggressive
---
People keep saying that but how? You can still tunnel survs once you apply deep wound I really do not see where people are coming from when they say this.
---
the only thing which would make this clip better is if he DCed afterward
---
If you wanna make a locker scare omelette, you gotta break a few absolute failure eggs!
---
can someone explain to BHVR what does nerf mean? 
---
THEY FUCKING DESTROYED IT NOT NERFED IT
---
Its a pretty cool concept tho
---
Would‚Äôve loved this same kind of support with DS :( killer mains. Never change

I'm an Ace main and the most exciting thing about his outfit is some damn khakis cause now I have more options for pants with my sweaters and buttonups. The top and head are pretty bluh tho.
---
Thank you :)
---
I've never been so confused by this sub. They literally made Legion less annoying and are banning exploits and somehow that's a bad thing. Bhvr employees can now flip the tables and scream "what do you want?!" With no one calling them out
---
I have the Adept Meg in my name for a reason lol
---
It's not a bug. You can call it an exploit if you wish, but it's not a bug. It's not due to some glitch. It's a manipulation of the game's mechanics.
---
I really wanna blame BHVR, and i do partially for going way too overboard, but we did do this to ourselves.  
---
I can't count the amount of hate messages that were directed to legion, the art , the comments, the posts.   
---
And we are surprised BHVR went too far? We all know how they like to "balance" things,  the 100057th "Delete Legion" pushed them a bit too far.  
---
We wanted a balance change, but we asked for it with memes and "DELETE LEGION" jokes that ended up costing us a possibly unique killer.   
---
Rip
---
We do like the legion rework. Legion is finally balanced.
---
Is there any link to the patch notes?
---
This is pretty clearly fake lmao.
---
I got that issue when i played on Haddonfield - I got the "Woodsboro" and "Sidney's House" map name but that was normal haddonfield map.
---
I don't do it
---
I play Legion a lot, I deal with it almost every game.
---
But calling them f***ots is just fucking wrong. 
---
Get over yourself, mate.
---
He actually did delete it, F.
---
JUST BECAUSE I AM ON A HOOK DOESN'T MAKE ME A FREAKING MUSEUM PIECE TO BE ADMIRED UNTIL THE BAR RUNS OUT, KNOW WHAT I MEAN?!
---
I have no sympathy.
---
All you legion mains out there that moonwalked and used franks mixtapes every game deserve this.
---
The issue is, if you hit someone in deep wound mode you‚Äôre probably gonna lose them with the loss of feral frenzy animation.
---
Legion didn't need a nerf, they were already kind of weak outside of Frank's Mixtape. They needed a different sort of power, which meant a full rework. The frustration of playing against Legion, at least for myself, came from the fact that there was zero counter play. Legion's power was an all-in-one counter for every single survivor escape mechanism. It's very frustrating when pretty much the only variable in a chase is how many frenzy hits they need to land, and you can do almost nothing to prevent those.
---
I have a video here on Reddit where I spawned into the game on mother's dwelling I rushed to my totem and by the time I got their in a total of 38 seconds my ruin was gone for the entire game In which costed me a perk slot for nothing. This has also happened with devour hope.
---
Killers have no way to get rid of any survivors perks.
---
Killers can't even destroy a chest that does nothing to your perk slots.
---
All killers really have is Franklin's demise and that's not a perk destroyer either.
---
Survivors can take away our hooks, and our totems making certain perks unusable.
---
That part is true, but calling people ****ots is just childish and takes away from the argument. It makes a serious point look less professional.
---
If the President came on and gave a compelling speech, but ended it with

Hmm? I don‚Äôt understand what you‚Äôre saying? I‚Äôm not coming for you if that‚Äôs what you think lol, I wish people would‚Äôve been all in the comments saying it‚Äôs bullshit. Not calling you a killer main if that‚Äôs what you thought
---
A slight slow is much different than the near stop that comes from ending Frenzy. 
---
It would be nice to have the actual numbers to prove it and do the math, but they don‚Äôt really release those. 
---
(Could do some testing in KYF to check.)
---
However, currently running cold dirt on Legion still gives survivors a good head start coming out of Frenzy, much more than base Plague‚Äôs cool down. I am actually surprised they have not nerfed Plague yet due to complaining about it. Likely because not many people have been playing it (only played against her once in about two weeks). 
---
This is a game where fractions of seconds matter. Brutal strength shaves off less than half a second but people run it all the time. Legion‚Äôs cooldown is in seconds. That is a 4-8 meter lead for a survivor. With a difference in movement speed of about half a meter a second, that is at least 4-8 seconds of catching up to the survivor (unless they are a potato). That is more than enough time for a survivor to get to the other side of a loop. 
---
Again, addons could change this, but I doubt it. I see Legion being played to cheese the first hit, then using cooldown addons to get a second hit out of Frenzy. Same problems people have now with the exception of the out-of-chase exploit. If this becomes the meta, the complaints will continue and more changes will be needed. We will see what happens in the PTB.
---
YOU ARE QUITE A BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF FLESH, YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?
---
Why even waste the shards on the shrine?
---
Just level and unlock the perk for every killer and save shards for cosmetics.
---
Pig gets a lot of hate. Many pigs tunnel trapped survivors, preventing them from getting traps off, just to get a kill with the trap. See it often when I play survivor. I get at least 10 people disconnect from a match with me during a stream, just because I am playing pig.
---
It's because the DBD community is a hive mind
---
I'm saying 'Nurse's' as in the perk, 'A Nurse's Calling'. Faster to type, albeit apparently at the cost of some confusion. I'm aware that the Nurse is a chick lol.
---
stfu giorno
---
People like you are just as much of a problem.   
---
How the fuck do you plan on keeping DBD alive in 5 years with the "Fuck everyone, they deserve it" mentality?   
---
I hate franks just as much as anyone here, but not all Legions run it. Just like how not all Claudette's are doing gens, you?
---
Ignore whatever I said, I think I misread what you said.
---
Agreed makes it too risky to use feral frenzy and go to other survivors and get more hits with it ,well if you can since you will be slower.
---
&gt;I have a video here on Reddit where I spawned into the game on mother's dwelling I rushed to my totem and by the time I got their in a total of 38 seconds my ruin was gone for the entire game In which costed me a perk slot for nothing. This has also happened with devour hope.
---
Anecdotal evidence and bad RNG. They've also frequently tuned spawning points so they aren't likely to land on top of your totem at the start. 
---
&gt;Killers have no way to get rid of any survivors perks. Killers can't even destroy a chest that does nothing to your perk slots.
---
That's bc they shouldn't be able to. 
---
&gt;All killers really have is Franklin's demise and that's not a perk destroyer either. Survivors can take away our hooks, and our totems making certain perks unusable.
---
Dude are you complaining about Sabotage now too? Fucking lmao that mechanic was *gutted* bc of how it used to be. 
---
And as for your comment on hex Totems, imagine if Ruin had no counterplay and Surviviors just had to deal with it all game. Imagine if Devour hope had n totem tied to it and Surviviors just had to deal with it. 
---
Just imagine that, and now think about how broken that is..that's why our hex perks can be destroyed. If they were unstoppable, they'd be too strong.
---
No problem. The crouching is hard to pull off on a loop. I still am not that great at it, but it gets me a hit every so often when the survivor makes a mistake.
---
you people and your inability to understand that DIFFERENT people are bitching about DIFFERENT things is just amazing
---
Before the nerf, people who liked Legion didn't complain, people who hated Legion complained.
---
Now, people who liked Legion complain and people who hated him love it.
---
What i wanted with Legion was not make his frenzy utter shit and just balance it out.
---
Uh have you not heard that DLC costs real money?
---
I play both and I think the complaints from both sides are mostly accurate.
---
Fine, then it is an exploit.   
---
And one that is being fixed. Even with this, however, the base of Legion is what we should base him off of, not a exploit.   
---
Fix the exploit FIRST THING, then use what we have after to be the basis.   
---
Fix that fuck up, then worry about his terror radius. And, honestly, now that Feral prevents deep wound from going down, is kinda pathetic.
---
I'm loving all these comments from salty ass killer mains bitching about the hatch XD
---
How would that affect BT?
---
I think the point is that this new Legion doesn't seem to bring fun or variety to the game.
---
It‚Äôs completely ok to camp when the gens are all done. Otherwise you‚Äôd just be letting them go. This doesn‚Äôt however change the fact that it still sucks for the person getting camped.
---
Some people understand it and some people get salty. I can‚Äôt really blame them since I get pretty salty when I get camped after having a fairly good round. I don‚Äôt blame the killers though.
---
&gt; Lmao get good.
---
How fucking stupid do you have to be to tell someone to get good at a grind.
---
Leatherface is really underrated. People use him a few times and complain he‚Äôs bad, without learning turns and picking good add on combos.
---
He‚Äôs not the best killer in the game, but he‚Äôs a good mid tier killer.
---
It‚Äôs not even a bug, it‚Äôs a flat out exploit, which logically makes it a bannable offense, not sure if the devs banned people for it though.
---
I was like "they should make that rail vaultable" and you fucking vaulted it, this was a rollercoaster of emotions for me.
---
&gt;Bubba
---
&gt;against
---
Only in one out of ten games.
---
The people upset aren't all Legion mains lol.  People just wanted a flawed character to be more fair and fun and instead he got deleted.
---
if they didn't charge so much, i'd be willing to buy more often. but that shit is way overpriced
---
OMG!!!
---
I love to see others with this attitude. I'm not great at the game, I'm never going to be a famous player. But I like to experiment with it, make a build that's *interesting* rather than what's considered the strongest. No criticism of people who want to take meta perks, it's just not the way I prefer to play most of the time.
---
A refund.
---
Man I didn‚Äôt even think legion was broken, I got back into this game a week ago. And now I‚Äôm stuck forever with a killer who already was weak and now just seems weaker
---
I bought the dlc literally the day before the shrine updated because I was tired of waiting for bbq to show up in the shrine.
---
B-b-b-b-but you forgot freddy. :(
---
lol
---
They for some fucking reason removed pip loss from DCing as well so there‚Äôs literally no punishment at all right now.
---
that's me af
---
It is a very good reason to DC, if it is happening. I have dc'd a few times for it. However, there seem to be far less "nice" pig killers out there now. I don't care if I "win" the game, I just care about the fun factor. If I am killer, I want to know I gave you a run for your money, even if you win. As survivor, even if I die, I want to know it was hard to kill me, not just "easy" camp or tunnel. after 2600+ hours in this game, I have seen the game grow more and more competitive. People stopped caring about having fun, and only seem to want to get in the game, and end it as fast as possible. I try to make sure, as killer, that survivors remember what a good, fun game was like.
---
Best advice would be to buy and max out all of the perks that you see so the pool of perks that will appear in subsequent bloodwebs will be smaller until nothing but the perk you're looking for is popping up.

\&gt; The rest of the shrine is awful
---
\&gt; Bamboozle and Lithe in the shrine
---
Are we looking at the same one?
---
Tap doesn‚Äôt have any clothes that blend as well as p3 Claudette
---
&gt;Legion gets a ping where the survivors are after he hits one of them, yes?
---
If everyone is in the TR, sure. But now you have more warning that he's coming to split up. I seriously doubt that the extended timer on Frenzy is going to be enough that it will actually make a difference to help with the ability to get extra people since they can split earlier and he's slower.
---
&gt;Legion was incredibly annoying because of his mobility, speed, and ability to find every single survivor without really trying much. 
---
Legion was *not* annoying be cause of his speed. He was annoying because of the deep wounds moonwalking. He was annoying because once he got deep wounds on you, you had no hope if he picked you to be the one. He was a problem because there was no counterplay.
---
Yea the numbers need changing I just made up those perks on the spot
---
CLEARLY YOU HAVE NEVER MET ME! I COULD PASS FOR JOHN CARPENTER'S THE THING ON A BAD DAY.
---
No that‚Äôs not really broken considering if you look at literally any other killer. You know what‚Äôs broken? Amanda having zero terror radius, Mike being able to one shot anyone in the match, instant down blink nurse. THATS broken, having a who relies on his line of sight chase isn‚Äôt broken and shouldn‚Äôt be nerfed into oblivion for some easy change arounds.
---
Because I spent 1000 hours on this game and then they fucking broke it and now they're refusing to fix it. Even before that I hated the game but now I hate the game AND it's unplayable. Today alone I got 2 3man games as killer and later 2 or so matches with less than 4 survivors. Oh and I also had to end the game via TM once. FUN. But nah you're right it's a great game and I should buy more DLC and auric cells to support the HARD WORKING developers.
---
It's a killer that just got the 'Freddy treatment', a significant nerf.
---
Not sure why the downvotes, but I agree completely with you. He‚Äôs a more balanced killer this way! Killer mains like new killers because they like the fact that when they first come out they‚Äôre usually broken and it feels awesome to kill all 4 survivors effortlessly! Well, now he takes a little more skill and is a tiny bit less unique, so of course there will be complaints :/
---
I don‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs the killers fault that the survivors are little bitches and DC when they see a matchup they don‚Äôt like.
---
They should have made the exploit more effective. Example ‚Äî similar power. If you hit the survivors, he is bleeding out. If they do not mend fully, they are down no matter what. The timer is significant. Although, you being in a chase does not stop the bleeding.... And being out of the terror radius for X seconds causes rupture ‚Äî all progress the bleed instantly multiplies by 1.5 (which can down you If bleed is over 66%), and fully cleanses the bleed out if no down follows, still leaving you The bleed out timer should be around the average time for the chase to last + 10 seconds. So, if they mess up, you down them. If they do not, they will down either way if were next to you for too long. 
---
Now how to balance ‚Äî simple. Just twitch the time for the ability, bleed out effect, or Legions terror radius. Simple. Why it will not be op ‚Äî chase is time wasting (which can go either way). Legion will be a basic M1 killer. However, his ability allows him to get first hit easily, and will end the chase by downing if the target does not get out of the terror radius on time, mend etc.
---
Yes, it will create a somewhat tunneling play style. Yet, it still will be interesting to play as and not annoying to play against (if you go down, you other ‚Äî did not mend, did not mind-game killer to get out of the terror radius, or overextended the chase (by which you going down is fair anyway, as you wasted a plenty of killer‚Äôs time).
---
Think of him as Ash, Ash was also a total badass in his game but in the entity‚Äôs realm he doesn‚Äôt have that much power.
---
We asked for a rework, not a Freddy 2
---
They nerfed the "zoom" tho.
---
They even said not even nearly the same speed.
---
Ok, i apologise and didn‚Äôt realise you meant well. Sorry
---
Thank you, BHVR, very cool!
---
HE'S MODELED AFTER ASH VS THE EVIL DEAD ASH, WHO BASICALLY IS A GRANDPA. I THOUGHT IT WAS A VERY FAITHFUL RECREATION BUT I'M SORRY YOU DON'T LIKE IT
---
I'm pretty sure it's because a lot of people were basically demanding a rework
---
Sounds like an absolutely horrible idea to me but yey at least ya tried man so A for effort
---
Yeah, one would think they‚Äôd choose a much better map for a Scream chapter anyways, like maybe Woodsboro High School for an indoor map or Stu‚Äôs house from the end of the first movie.
---
Exactly, you also have to insidious basement camp as bubba and run noed on one shot killers. Thats just how you pip
---
It‚Äôs fine, you were just concerned for a different part of the creator‚Äôs emotional state.
---
Yeah, but it‚Äôs a reddit comment on a video game sub
---
Nobody‚Äôs here for the ¬´¬†professionalism¬†¬ª
---
Umm if a survivor leaves the tr the timer Ticks down, so why do a gen if bleeding out? Why is Legion leaving survivors up if out of frenzy, like we will have 115 so can do better in chases? Why be so reliant on deep wounds to down a ped? It, probably, was meant to be a Stall mechanic.
---
Reddit really loves to overreact to any change.
---
Legion is far from dead with this update. Sure they removed the moonwalking cheese and franks mixtape, but they made him way stronger in his non-scummy way of being played. Dont people realize that he still has the strongest power to injure survivors?
---
Maybe they shouldve kept the FF down with 4 hits, but maybe its not a big deal because any legion that needs to do 4 hits to down someone is going to lose the game anyways.
---
Also we dont know what his new addons will do, like a lot of killers are very addon dependant and we still dont know them.
---
At least they're trying xD
---
If playing against SWF yeah I can see the splitting up and communication being a thing, but even then not really. I play SWF all the time and even at rank 5 we still just scream and get the other guy caught lol it was awful that your mend timer kept going down while he chased you, so that fix is extremely important. Otherwise it‚Äôs just another tunneler. I see your point and agree that there needed to be a counter
---
ANOES?
---
Oh fuck I‚Äôm sorry, I thought you were XD I‚Äôve had a lot of people jump on me for this meme so I just assumed, sorry brah that‚Äôs my bad üëè
---

*cough Freddy *cough
---
I HAVE A FRIEND THAT COMPLAINS ABOUT EVERY GODDAMN UPDATE BECAUSE NONE OF IT IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE KILLERS AND EVERY UPDATE ONLY HELPS SURVIVORS MMK
---
Why would a survivor leave the terror radius if there is a gen 70% done and their friend is being chased nearby? Again. This is a difference between low rank and high rank. Rank 17 survivors will probably immediately scurry away to the opposite end of the map to mend in peace. Rank 1 survivors will finish the objective first if the Legion is still in TR before bothering to mend.
---
You have to leave survivors once you‚Äôve tagged them. It‚Äôs impossible to chase all 4 survivors at the same time with a basic m1 killer. Once you tag survivors, you need to pick one to commit to and finish the chase with.
---
I just basically DC on this map as a killer.
---
It's not only the fact that I cant see gens or auras from BBQ, but also invisible walls and invisible props. Fuck that
---
why are we still here... just to suffer?
---
Ah, thanks.
---
Lmfao
---
It ends up being faster because once the chase ends and the timer starts to go down, a survivor must make the disision to mend or loop a moonwalking legion. Once their forced to mend, legion can just come up and smack them.
---
Unless you 360. That actually works wonders. And since the Legion will now grind to a halt should he miss I‚Äôd call that *significant* counter play. Unless you really think hitting someone who knows how to 360 juke takes ‚Äúzero thinking or skill.‚Äù
---
The totems that start at the end of the game start towards the end because it is supposed to affect endgame gameplay. I think hexes are fine where they are as both a survivor and a killer, as hex totem perks tend to be good, however I don‚Äôt know how it feels as a killer as I mainly play survivor and I hardly use hex perks
---
That horse makes me always so nervous when theres a gen there, the noise he makes makes me be extra alert, specially for Wraith's footsies or Pig/Myers breath
---
bUt ThEyrE aLl m1 KiLLerS
---
The argument people are saying is that you can basically force everyone to have no mither. At that point you are a 115 killer and can down someone with M1. 
---
If you played Legion with cooldown addons, that will likely be the new meta. Hit everyone in the area, then tunnel the last person out of Frenzy.
---
To me, that is boring. As a killer, I want to with feel powerful or tricky. Unless they do something interesting with the addons, playing as Legion will still feel cheap and playing against him will still feel like being tunneled.
---
Oh that's dumb. Why don't they just make it so if Legion is close to a surv the mend doesn't go down?
---
Hex perks are supposed to be high risk high reward.  No one is making you use them.
---
&gt; And some of the Hex perks don‚Äôt even activate till the end of the match which makes them useless the whole game anyways.
---
You mean NOED?  Again, high risk, high reward.
---
That's not what I meant, you're not really going to be hitting people you've already put into deep wounds, instead, you'll be putting one person through a chase after hitting everyone else assuming they're nearby, during that chase, all of the others will be off mending, while you can get a semi-easy down with your regular attacks, since the survivor can't mend themselves AND avoid you at the same time, you get a reasonably extended chase in which no generators are being done until all other survivors mend themselves.
---
I‚Äôm looking forward to what they could do. Bricky said on his stream that the rework would be more accurate to Freddy‚Äôs lore, so god knows what his new power will be. I‚Äôm hoping they can make Freddy viable without making him losing his identity as the dream demon, or being ridiculously OP.
---
With the nerf they made it so progress doesnt go down as long as the survivor is in the terror radius. So in a sense, they did exactly your proposition.
---
Imo at lower/mid ranks killers are more prone to camp in the endgame for the sake of safeguarding the kill which means if you were playing altruistically it‚Äôs probably gonna get you killed
---
Thats true but it seems that you will now need to use feral for the first hit and use the regular m1 attack for the second hit, thus getting rid of him being able to jump pallets and windows, which means counterplay is possibpe now.
---
Instead of coming up with an actual answer you just ask "lol y u here XDDD" good job. Nah you're right I'll go and buy some auric cells RIGHT NOW to support these people. Maybe the infinite loading screen issue will get fixed in December this year, if we're lucky.
---
Does every killer NEED to be on nurse, spirit or billy level?
---
Half the killers are m1 killers. Legion is now too.
---
I never said the changes made him a god tier killer. I merely rebuked the idea that he's garbage and useless because of them.
---
Legion is totally viable. He's just not gonna be a Rank 1 Nurse kinda killer. But he doesn't need to be.
---
Until we see the values we can't say anything for sure.
---
A dev said in twitch chat that while his speed is lower, the duration is higher, so overall you get more distance than you used to,
---
The huntress one is essentially play one huntress game thats easy as shit.
---
I can also force people to have no mither if I just hit them all once and they choose not to heal and I happen to find them again - especially because not healing seems to be the trend in red ranks - but that shouldn't be the case with a killer who is supposed to have an ability. Legion is a killer with an ability for a reason, except their ability revolves around deep wound, which is now little more than a yellow bar underneath the survivors' names since they won't be forced to mend immediately in a lot of situations. Couple that with the penalties for using Feral Frenzy and it's almost like you'll be better off never using your ability at all.
---
Isn't it more likely BHVR didn't have any ideas on how to make him counterable and still viable/fun? Kind of means the only option to please the majority is to just lessen him until they have an idea.
---
You literally need to have any patience and press your m1 button. It is not hard to land a hit in this game, I don't know why are you trying to defend it.
---
Yeah, the whole BBQ not appearing in the shrine for more than a year was a scummy intentional move by the devs. As for LF, yeah i agree, any friend of mine that bought him just never played him after they got BBQ, any streamer that i do see play him mostly does so due to them rotating to different killers to keep games fresh, not many of them actually like him.
---
I recognized a r/dbdgonewild photo ü§î
---
12% faster is pathetic. What the perk should be is:
---
Perform altruistic actions 10/15/20% faster. When the gates are powered, perform them 25/50/75% faster.
---
Get rid of the BP gain and just make it a nice, teamwork based perk
---
There is, but can we really call that a punishement. It auto-bans you if you get above 20% (I think ?) of a certain amount of last games
---
I'll say it again, there is still time for it to change. Not saying that they 100% will change it but it's still possible.
---
Glad you enjoyed it. Not gonna lie, I was praying for it to be vaultable, because I don't usually loop on that area and I couldn't remember if that specific tile was vaultable, since it can also spawn in horizontal.
---
I think having a ranked mode and a casual mode would help with dc kind of like what league of legends does with more dc consequences for ranked
---
I don't see how its survivors faults when they DC in sympathy to the first guy that DCs because there's a legion in the game and omg 3 people deep wounded already now hes coming for me with a nasty blade and oh god this game is so much fun please never change legion
---
I think it‚Äôs billy just does what he does but better has the same anti loop capabilities along with the one shot down (you need to be more accurate though) but he has the addition of insane map presssure
---
Well, yeah.
---
Can someone pls explain the legion changes? Legion fricken sucks to play against now; you can‚Äôt escape them.
---
What is in the update and is it for the good of survivors or ruining survivors lives?
---
Exactly. Never be a Bobby.
---
That last line is only true for the top 10/15% of survivors btw
---
Unless they increase mend time, 15 seconds isn‚Äôt gonna make much different, and it‚Äôs going to suck having to go through the stun anyway to continue to chase the one dude you‚Äôve decided to go after.
---
Suzy and Rin are sweet angels who must be protected
---
LITERALLY THE WHOLE FUCKING REASON I'M IN THIS THREAD IS TO TELL PEOPLE TO **STOP BITCHING ABOUT THE LEIGION "NERF" BEFORE IT'S EVEN FUCKING OUT**, YOU HAVEN'T EVEN FUCKING PLAYED THE SHIT YET, YOU ABSOLUTE FUCKING PINECONES, AND WHAT DO YOU DO? BITCH ABOUT THE LEGION NERF. PLEASE @ GOD WHY DO U TRY ME IN THIS WAY
---
GENUINELY I'M MOSTLY JOKING BUT BLEASE,,, LEARN HOW TO TAKE A CHILL PILL AND *ACTUALLY PLAY THE CHANGES* BEFORE MAKING A SNAP ASSUMPTION, PLEASE GOD.
---
Thats where everyone is nowadays anyway isnt it
---
Who's Amanda? The only killer I know it's the pig
---
What are you talking about? It‚Äôs not even live yet.
---
The funny thing is, is that in that scene, with glasses everything is blurry for him, so really...
---
Totally agree! I love blood warden and always run it. Go figure. So much fun.
---
Awww look at all the legion crybabies downvoting all my posts lmao
---
Never said so, but everything about the character stinks. The copy pasted addons from Hillbilly, the half-assed barely working chili addons, the power that is just a close range insta-down with it's highest potential being strong hook protections, with it also offering nothing much new to freshen up gameplay other than hugging some objects hoping they miss for the 5th time they spammed it, lead to me and others finding him meh to bad. By all means like him and find him fun, i was just stating the general opinion on him and with this comment some reasons as to why people think so.
---
Lithe is the second worst exhaustion perk. 
---
Bamboozle is situationally good. Only always good at killer shack. 
---
Yes, we are looking at the same shrine.
---
I agree with your basic points, but Frenzy will be helpful to hit 2 or three people quickly to injure them. After that, yes, M1 basic killer (unless they have some cheesy meta addon changes)
---
Here comes the trapperüé∂
---
Better get some ginger snaps!üé∂
---
Only gay people disconnect?
---
I understand what you're saying. But it really all comes down to subjectivity.
---
Nurse and Billy are the undisputed king and queen of killers yet more than half the community still play other killers including the m1 killers.
---
So not every killer really needs to be a top tier killer.
---
When you have over a dozen killers in a game with varying powers that all fundamentally play the same but still try to be unique and have their own variety, it's nearly impossible to balance that 100%.
---
Either everyone is essentially an M1 killer, or everyone is an OP Nurse.
---
For the games balance sake, m1 killer balance is the better balance despite how unfun that may sound as a killer main.
---
Ghost face as a killer? Wonder what kind of killer power he would have.
---
And a lot of people didn‚Äôt bitch, but now that these changes are happening the people that didn‚Äôt are now speaking up. And OP here says that everyone who complained before are the exact same people complaining now even if it‚Äôs a different set of people complaining coz they nerfed a character into the ground when all we wanted was a rework, not nerf.
---
Never mori an ash with the nurse, it will haunt you.
---
yes. just another m1 killer. literally.
---
Man I hate a killer with this perk.
---
If they are doing their best to stop gens from getting done, good luck getting past that.
---
And if a Billy has it?
---
You're fucked
---
"YOU HAVE BEEN DEEMED, UNWORT-" *Feng escapes*
---
Just to be sure, what makes you think you would be banned for using things that are explicitly added by the devs for player use?
---
I just wanted an update that‚Äôd make playing Legion a bit less toxic :(
---
And then you would win against them most of the time with a half descent team. There is a reason a lot of them relied on good addons, stalling builds and moonwalking to win, a "fair" Legion is too weak.
---
GIT GUD YOU FUCKING SCRUB
---
When the person who dcs start of the match, turns out to be your dying light. Oooo man ive only had it happen twice but its so good.
---
PLEASE SEND THEM MY WAY BECAUSE I'M HAVING THE OPPOSITE PROBLEM AND I WANT THE SATISFACTION OF OUTSMARTING HIM AS QUENTIN. I NEVER SEE HIM. :(
---
Well Im interested in the game but Im still kinda new, so I only have like 2 teachables
---
Spooky
---
Apparently there's an exploit where mend time takes ages if you use both Legion Blade add ons
---
In fact, there are many of us who ship her with wraith FYI
---
Downvoted because you‚Äôre using the meme wrong
---
If you want a somewhat sequel to dbd, just take a look at Identity V:
---
It's f2p, can be played on mobile or pc and the dbd devs both approved and helped develop it.
---
It has a lot of similarities with dbd, but also quite a few differences,
---
with some of them being survivor specific items and abilities, a different perk system and an interchangable ability for killer.
---
EVERYONE WHO PLAYS LEATHERFACE  SHOULD BE EXECUTED BY FIRING SQUAD
---
THEY'RE ALL AS MENTALLY HANDICAPPED AS CHAINSAW BOI HIMSELF
---
I value my time too much to play Legion matches
---
I live the new patch
---
FOV: infinite
---
Maybe we will have something else to do with the ‚Äúendgame collapse‚Äù. 
---
But otherwise, you are right. Even if the person gets away, you will likely get 1-2K points in survivor founds and a few hits. That is better than the 500 points you would get for a sacrifice. 
---
(Assuming you aren‚Äôt Leatherface, who has a degree in camping.)
---
It does matter. Quite a lot, actually. Not everyone wants to run the absolute top tier meta, and the shrine is, once again, not awful just because there is Lithe instead of BL.
---
Bamboozle is still better than a numerous list of teachables, and an even longer list on killers like Myers, Wraith, Freddy, etc. Once again, just because it's not Spirit's Fury or Ruin it doesn't mean it's bad.
---
IF I COULD I DEFINITELY WOULD BECAUSE I AM SERIOUSLY BAD AT OUTSMARTING AND OUTRUNNING THEM BECAUSE WHEN THEY SWING THEY GOT LIKE TEN THOUSAND METERS AND I GET CLAPPED, GOOD LUCK FINDING ONE THOUGH AND I HOPE YOU ESCAPE
---
That pretty much sums up both sides...
---
I never said that he had to be as good as Nurse or Billy.  However, I do think that the developers should strive to create more interesting killers, rather than ones that are designed to "waste your time".
---
&gt; Legion is totally viable.
---
All the killers are viable to some degree.  Some just aren't as strong as others, specifically, the ones that can't really utilize their power in a chase.  There is a reason why Wraith, Freddy, Pig, and Leatherface are all considered weak.
---
It is more than evident in your character that you are the type of person who wouldn‚Äôt benefit from or even recognize sage criticism when it is given.
---
It doesnt bother me anymore tbh. With all of the perks at my disposal as a survivor its not even a problem half the time. 
---
I dedicated alot of time to memorizing the new totem spots and I bring small game usually. 
---
If a killer gets noed its the survivors fault. 
---
Its 100% avoidable.
---
Lol. I literally never heal in my games and run the killer around 90% of the time. If you don't suck ass being instadown isn't that big of a deal.
---
Not necessarily face camping but proximity camping is pretty viable imo after all generators are complete. I don't enjoy it because I wouldn't want to be in the hooked survivors shoes but when none of the other survivors leave once the gates have been opened theres really no other option unless you can slug everyone or just let everyone escape.
---
They just made it so legion plays how he was designed to be played, rather than just tunneling single survivors into the dirt with M2. It's a nice change and if you utilized his power correctly before, you're not going to be hit too bad by the change.
---
Watch it just be 116% speed. 1% more. Legion just poeer walks you to death.
---
He‚Äôs supposed to be faster?
---
Because they did a great job of that during their PTB (which only lasted a week) and the past months. Remember when they though Legion needed a buff to have deep wounds start lower when applying them to injured survivors? All i'm saying is, they are really out of touch as to what the Legion needs and it shows.
---
That really wouldn't be an exploit moreso a bug, if your that worried just don't do it, that being said it's up to the devs to make sure bugs are fixed in a timely manner and if it was really that big of a deal they would put out a statement to let players know it it known and not to do it as they would consider it an exploit. Until then I say do what you want.
---
Thank you for understanding that
---
he coulda flipped it too
---
A killer made out of 4 members Frank ( the instigating douche) Julie ( Popular emo girl) Joey (.. nothing negative on him he‚Äôs just Joey ) SUSIE ( THE MOST PRECIOUS LEGION KILLER WHO SHOULD HAVE BEEN A SURVIVOR BUT IM HAPPY WE HAVE HER EITHER WAY SHE MUST BE PROTECTED AT ALL COST) they released and were kinda meh but with time people started hating the killers power ( salty survivor mains and twitch streamer / youtube content creators) so Behavior decided to give them the Freddy treatment ( Nerfed them to the point where they suck horribly)
---
Happens most times I use BPS.
---
Legion just got nerfed into the ground lol. Until recently this game has been incredibly survivor sided. Take your own advice.
---
Oh yeah, but I've been on the receiving end of it. You basically start a match with 3 survivors and 5 gens with Dying Light. Not easy.
---
THIS IS A RAGE THREAD GET YOUR FUCKING CAPS LOCK BACK ON
---
As a survivor main it feels to me like I am reliant on the killer. I need him to hook more often to get my rescues for a pip. Also to engage in a chase and so on. With every survivor sprinting to the hook and farming, desperate for a pip... it‚Äôs not mich fun for me anymore :(
---
Great of you to put every person in this reddit in the same bus just by opinions on the vocal minority. Most people actually wanted Legion reworked, not deleted o nerfed to oblivion, REWORKED.
---
Git gud scrub. You have all the advantages use them.
---
Sry but where do i find the notes for the rework? Can't find them at all
---
Trapper has a lower win rate sadly
---

---
Eh, it's Remake Freddy, I'm ok with that :P
---
As a survivor, NOED is irritating to go against. Rejects any chance of altruism, and often helps killers get 1-2 people they shouldn't have gotten. As a killer, I don't really like it since there are so many better perks I can use throughout the entirety of the match, rather than using a perk that only works for the end of the match AND can be cleansed.
---
True, but I feel he has more chase potential
---
No, it actually does not matter at all. Being good in dead by daylight is being effective or efficient. If you want to be effective or efficient, you‚Äôre not running lithe. If you don‚Äôt want to run top meta, cool. Doesn‚Äôt make lithe good. 
---
You seem to not understand. If I don‚Äôt need the perk, it‚Äôs not valuable to me. I don‚Äôt need bamboozle. It‚Äôs great at killer shack, whoop de doo. 
---
Therefore this shrine offered me nothing, and thus sucks.
---
How is healing a guarenteed death? Are you so trash that you can't lose a killer?
---
Thanks
---
Unpopular opinion:  WGLF is objectively one of the worst perks in the game, because it literally provides no gameplay bonuses.  NOLB is shit, but it is objectively better because it actually does something in the game rather than just a meta bonus of ‚Äúyou grind more efficiently‚Äù.  The only perks that are worse than WGLF are ones that actively give your character a handicap, such as No Mither, Autodidact (you will almost never get more than 3 prompts meaning the perk almost never pays for itself), and Object of Obsession in a solo survivor game (obviously paired with SWF it can be an extremely powerful tool).  Don‚Äôt use either of these perks, but I think WGLF fucks your team over more, especially because it encourages players to act like moronic farming dickheads.
---
Oh ffs. Of course they have. Ugh that's so frustrating.
---
Alot of people only play 1 side and it makes for alot of dense people on this sub.
---
If Legion is the sacrifice we need to get Bunny Feng...
---
Well, I'll main Plague and Huntress instead of Legion and Huntress
---
WHY DONT BEHAVIOUR FUCKING EXPLODE HEX RUIN? I HATE THE FACT THAT ITS SO NECESSARY. HATE GOING AGAINST IT AS A SURVIVOR AND HATE HAVING TO USE IT AS A KILLER, FUCK RUIN HAVE TO LEVEL UP KY KILLERS FOR THEM TO BE PLAYABLE AKA HAVE RUIN. 
---
FUCK
---
THIS
---
PERK.
---
&gt;Deep wound timer ALSO doesn‚Äôt go down if you‚Äôre mending so.. excuse me. I don‚Äôt even have any commentary on this other than, what?
---
I mean, it was kind of bullshit that the timer went down to all but zero when you were mending, then all the Legion had to do was come along and happen to find you, then you'd move and bam, insta-downed. This fixes that.
---
&gt;Yeah I'm not believing that.
---
Not believing what? The entire post? Some parts of it? Please be more specific.
---
&gt;You always post heavily in favor of survivors
---
I mostly play killer. That doesn't prevent me from noticing that there was close to nothing the survivors could against Legion in a chase, hence why I never really played him. He sucked the fun out of killer games for me, as I like it when both sides have input in a chase.
---
&gt;Now people will only enjoy playing against him because it's an easy win on account of him being trash and weak. 
---
I'll play him once he's changed since he seems pretty fun to me. I know several people that've told me they will be much more interested in playing more of/playing Legion at all when the changes come through, because the current Legion was really boring to them. Legion in his current state doesn't really play Dead by daylight. You just wait for cooldowns to get guaranteed hits.
---
&gt;I just play both sides unlike you who is just about the most tunnel visions survivor main I've ever seen post on the reddit lol.
---
Again, I'm mostly playing killer and if you check my post history I've commented on buffs some weaker killers should recive to make them more playable. Plus mostly playing killer doesn't mean I must only argue in defense of killers. I can comment on things when I think some things killers have are badly designed/overpowered. If I think that Legion/Nurse have balance and design flaws, I'm going to voice my opinion. It's not a camp of us vs them.
---
Also while we‚Äôre at it, can we also get young ash?
---
I let the choice. If they wiggle hook if not hatch. Make your choice
---
Wolverine will never noticed you, killer scrub.

YIKES DUDE. I MEAN I KNOW ITS RAGE WEDNESDAY, BUT THERE IS STILL A LINE, AND TO ME, IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE INSULTING THE POOR GUY.

Still waiting for a prom night Susie outfit

He just copied what OP said and changed it a bit
---
IT MIGHT LOOK LIKE I HAVE MY "PANTIES IN A TWIST" BECAUSE I'M SHOUTING BUT I'M LITERALLY JUST SHOUTING BECAUSE WE'RE IN A RAGE WEDNESDAY THREAD, FRIENDO. I'M JUST JOKING AROUND A LITTLE WITH MY PHRASING AND ALSO WHOLEHEARTEDLY FED UP WITH THE OVERALL WHININESS OF THIS SUB ABOUT CHANGES THAT HAVEN'T EVEN GONE LIVE YET, THAT'S ALL. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø HAVE A GOOD DAY!
---
The terror radius is a nerf as legion always had 32 meters base during his power and less when simply walking around.
---
Its surprising how many people simply do not know common information like this and then call for changes when they dont understand the game.
---
Longer power duration doesnt matter much due to lowered power speed.
---
They arent joking when they say legion is now the worst because at best he was mediocre with lack of counterplay if he played specifically to chase down one guy. What he got was being put into a grave rather than being made viable but with ways to play around him.
---
Yeah, I experienced that today AS killer but it was really bad last night when I was doing SWF on discord. A LOT of people I played with were going on about being tunneled, or camped throughout the entire game and I feel like saying, "No, that's not what happened, I was there."
---
Similarly, only killer main. Dont use hex perks and then you get to have 4 perks all match!
---
Seriously, I get that some of us use em to slow down gen rushes, but most of my builds have no room for that. Just pick a tight 3-4, protect them through the match and venture to a 5th as you are able.
---
&gt;By your logic, my post has 173 upvotes, yours has 2. Wouldn't that mean clearly most people agree with me? :P
---
The fallacy of visual accessibility 
---
I'm not the one that's stating an opinion that's counter to what the top players are saying. Think everything through my dude. Read what the top players are saying and think about why they're saying it
---
Bait account is bait
---
No salt without pepper. I'm tried of it
---
I mean at full charge now they can already vault several times, outside of the initial frenzy hit, the power won't be useful if you're going for the same person, idk what kinda chase you're doing if you have to vault a window/pallet more than 2-3 times in a single frenzy, and if you do you won't close the distance on the survivor enough to be breathing down their neck. Not to also mention hitting that survivor with frenzy again is completely pointless and whiffing just one attack in frenzy will stun you as well.
---
115 is good and all, but it;s not like that's going to make a whole lotta difference if their power is ass. Literally look at all the "high tier" killers that are 110 speed and "low tier" killers that are 115.
---
Trapper conceptually is one of my fave killers, the idea of defeat by prediction and trickery. He just severely needs another buff and QOL changes to be viable. It takes far too long to set up, and he basically requires green addons to be playable. Even if they just let you reset traps without picking them up, and maybe set it at a base 2 carriage traps, he‚Äôd feel ok.
---
We can only dream, my friend
---
Yeah I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre fresh new reddit account wasn‚Äôt made to try and fool gullible people or anything.
---
a link is pinned to the top of the subreddit, my guy.
---
Except you can't tell that unless they either tell you through their names or you just guess well.
---
SWF doesn't mark you as pals, where as it's pretty damn obvious who the killer is.
---
Have you even tried to give it to me or are you just going to assume that I can‚Äôt take it? Most of the comments I‚Äôve received are more insulting me than criticism.
---
Enough is enough. Stop giving BHVR a free pass. The community asked for Legion to be balanced. BHVR responded by obliterating Legion. The fault here is *entirely* on BHVR.
---
Is it weird that I can hear the male Legion stun sound when I look at this image?
---
HONESTLY it's EASTER, WHAT FUCKING BETTER TIME IS THERE, BHVR
---
A man's gotta go to the bathroom.
---
Yeah, never said they didn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm making fun of the fact that joking about legion a week ago would‚Äôve gotten you murdered with down votes while now a large majority pretends they‚Äôve liked him the whole time, lol.
---
Makes me wanna wipe my ass with your cereal
---
GODDAMN ASSHOLE SURVIVORS STOP DCING AFTER BEING DOWNED
---
No, not in their defense. Don't give them defense. Don't praise them for making shitty changes. I can't believe I'm having to say this. BHVR sucks so much that the community is pleased with the bare minimum.
---
Slower than 115% or slower as in "Frenzy speed has been reduced"?
---
Frenzy speed has been reduced
---
Joey can be bought with shards too but he's super expensive and you'll have to grind to get it. 21k shards
---
Swapped to was Claudette?
---
nice flair
---
I mean I call Bull on you mostly playing killer. Its self reported so you can easily lie. Most of the stances you take in posts are overly supportive of survivors rather than taking a balanced approach. Plus if you really did play killer you would not need to outwardly state it, you would realize it has nothing to do with the content of your arguments simply that I said you take survivor side all the time.
---
You're lying and it's very clear. You show no understanding of what most people who actually play killer or both sides know. Post history means nothing and if it did it would tell the opposite story
---
It's a shame you spend so much time on long responses. Your opinion is so biased to one side that the only reason you get upvotes is because its survivor favored and there are 4x as many players as killer players.
---
I always kill off the flashlight ones first, they think they‚Äôre being toxic by bringing a flashlight.... but they‚Äôre really just asking to be killed off first lmao.
---
The equivalent to the "let him/her go!" said to the person holding a hostage over a huge drop.
---
I want to believe that the increase in duration and reduced speed is the same distance as the decreased duration increased speed.
---
Incorrect. The changes to Legion is not the community's fault.
---
Okay then go. You know how complicated it would be to have that much mechanics for a killer? Also the dlc was what $10? So if you logged in over 5 hours I say you got the monies worth. Is BHVR a AAA company and popping out Call of Daylight every year? No? Then neesh man.
---
found the guy who doesn't play killer
---
No salt without pepper
---
 I do too, but we both know it won't be
---
So now if I miss an attack during Frenzy my Frenzy gets cancelled and I have to wait for it to fully recharge again to use it once more......
---
So now it‚Äôs less of a Feral Frenzy and more of an Apethetic Swat.
---
And the terror radius is increased and deep wound pauses if they‚Äôre in the radius or mending. Just...holy shit. So pissy SWF teams throw some fits and the devs completely destroy a character.
---
That's actually a very good point!
---
I know its so stupid. The worst I had it was from these swf streamers(I watched all the vods after) they accused me of tunneling YET i never hooked the same person in a row. What was happening is the guy getting unhooked, stayed at hook to heal then used lvl one sabo no toolbox to sabo the hook to completion. So By the time I hooked someone else my bbq would show him STILL THERE. They sucked at skillchecks to so I could always find them. Im sorry bby toxic streamer but its not tunneling if you constantly let the killer know where you are throughout the entire game. 
---
I believe it is common from people with no sense of situtational or map awareness. I come from games like csgo so it helps train for that. But they seem to struggle and just blurt out excuses.
---
Maybe I'm missing the point, but it seems like now his power is a way to control an area, patrol faster, and apply pressure that forces survivors to waste time healing. He's weak to loops again, but it should be somewhat mitigated by his ability to force several survivors to spend a lot of time healing in a short timeframe.
---
I won't cleanse that totem ;)
---
Get yourself a swf. Even a bad swf.
---
But people you know who will think twice about dicking you over. By and large this community is a toxic cesspool and everybody is splash fighting in it.
---
Tl;dr man. tl;dr
---
That's not me m8. We're chilling...
---
Just wondering, does anyone know if we will even get more skins for ash? Or are the two we got most likely the last?.
---
I'll have you know that's 15 gumballs worth.... Bet you never had that many gumballs at once!
---
I know. I'm thrilled. I openly, vehemently HATE legion.
---
"He'll be fine?" What the fuck are you saying? He has no power now.
---
No offense but the game is survivor sided. Killers do fair but there are still things that are nuts. Mettle is a start as is wonky hit boxes.
---
Thing is when survivors DC they get the changes they want like removing legion from the game. When killers DC they get changes that make it harder for them to tell when to DC against a group of survivors who will taunt you all game lol.
---
It sucks bc playing both sides survivors get changes that are totally not needed because they just play incompetently and it hurts your game as a survivor and killers just get shit on for survivors not willing to take a loss and get better like you have to do if you play killer.
---
&gt; And let‚Äôs not forget Legion will be punished twice for using this power (power draining completely if missing a hit, then having to wait however long for the power bar to fill back up COMPLETELY before using it again)
---
It doesn‚Äôt drain completely, you are just stunned with a miss (which you should be)
---
I love using the wraiths all seeing perk. It's cool.  Micheal Myers is op af. I dont even have to try and I get a 3k with him without ruin. I dont slug for the 4k so the last person always gets the hatch because I dont camp it. I smack them and thet jump in lol.
---
Use it in your pants! Jk. ;-P
---
Can we please stop this ideology that if you die, you lose? And that, if you don‚Äôt kill a certain person, they beat you? 
---
This isn‚Äôt a game where one side loses and the other side wins.
---
It is pretty dumb that Deep Wound is essentially going to pose no threat at all.
---
Look at lol, fortnite, apex ect... riot was a small company and look where they are now... just by selling chars and skins.
---
People would've bought cosmectics, if they didn't drop legion in the dumbster.
---
u're acting like bhvr is the only company in the world with a game.
---
It is bought, boughten is not a word. I agree, let's see the ptb and the add-ons.
---
Forgot about Mettle. Can definitely see that being very annoying. Hit boxes are absolutely insane, nothing better than getting downed from a swing that was aimed 7 miles in the opposite direction of me.
---
u sound like a trash killer. maybe l2p and git gud?
---
Yeah but being in the terror radius will fix that. So pausing the timer when mending isn't even needed but they are doing it anyway.
---
* Wraith has high mobility and with the right perks and addons can be just as dangerous as a Nurse.  Suddenly going invisible is fucking amazing topped off with how some of his addons make his bell quiet, making him even better vs your average player who isn't staring at grass or isn't running say the Cat perk.
---
* Nurse is pretty evident on why she's good.  Good in a chase, out of a chase, etc.
---
* Spirit can still track players so she is already better than Legion as you can use her both IN a chase and getting the first hit.  I'd argue that Spirit is one of the more threatening killers as the right use of her phase can make people do stupid things and leave themselves open to get hit.
---
* Amanda can stall the game out for unhealthy amounts of time with even basic addons.  Combo'd with the right perks ala Ruin the game can take so long people actually die from the trap.
---
* Freddy can trance multiple people and get multiple first hits.  Even though you can kinda BS Freddy's power, if everyone or even most survivors are asleep they can't wake up easily so you put a nice stall on the game.
---
Out of all the First Hit M1 killers, Legion is now the defacto worst, even worse than Freddy.  He can't chase them with his power as he loses the ability to see tracks of *any* kind which means that he can only use it to get the first hit, and it doesn't stall out the game as say Amanda or Freddy's does as both of them either get a hook and then their power activates to it's full stall or it makes everything really fucking slow.  He also isn't that threatening as a first hit killer as both Wraith, Nurse and Spirit lack a terror radius, for the most part, when going for their attacks so it's far harder to actively avoid them while Legion always has his and lacks a decent way, built in, to lower his terror radius.  Even just the fact that you don't lose Deep Wound when in his terror radius, with it now being bigger, means that it is far easier to cheese a Legion who doesn't just swing at you twice, can his ability, than attack you normally after a long ass chase which Feral is now worthless in.
---
Feral did two things before, one it slowed the game down by hurting players with Deep Wound which means that they are slightly slower and have to actively try to mend to avoid going down, and two, allows a Legion to effectively pick out 2+ survivors and slow them at the same time.  The issue is that now he is good at neither of those things as mending is now far easier to do given the extra restrictions on when it starts and other killers can do better crowd control through other perks or their own abilities.
---
Part of why Legion was strong had very little to do with his actual ability or kit, but how fucking busted some of his addons were.  Double blade was entirely bullshit, but so was Mixtape and Dirt. We can argue that Feral didn't allow for counterplay but maybe I'm the only damn survivor on the planet who is decent at dropping pallets on Killer's heads so there is that too.
---
I boughtened it though. Boughtened with money.
---
YOU FORGOT PLAY LEGION BEFORE THE MORI
---
He‚Äôs weak if youre not tunneling with m2. I only hit with deep wound ona survivor if someone was trying to loop me at one of the (mostly) inf loops or I‚Äôm chasing them in the open. If they‚Äôre going to loop me at a pallet that isn‚Äôt as safe I‚Äôll just destroy the pallet or jump over and try to m1 if they‚Äôre bad. If i go for destroying pallet I just leave the chase so I usually just go for that.
---
It‚Äôs pretty boring playing him in a non tunnely way as I can‚Äôt get as many kills as a tunneling Legion, but I‚Äôll get people saying ‚ÄúThanks for not tunneling‚Äù sometimes, so it‚Äôs worth it not tunneling
---
But wglf isnt shit compared to bbq, they need to adjust it so that if you save the killer doesnt get a notification until 5 seconds after you pull them off the hook or you see their aura like break down..
---
*2sad4me starts playing*
---
It is a shame that almost everything that releases now is only for Auric Cells and is the max price too.
---
Yeah the way I see it, I fully understand why the licensed stuff isn‚Äôt buyable with shards. But anything that‚Äôs original shouldn‚Äôt be auric cells only. I‚Äôm sorry but I will never buy anything with the cells unless there is good reason. I have bought the dlc‚Äôs for Nightmare, Saw, Leatherface, Halloween and Ash and had no problem with doing so because I understand. But I‚Äôll never fall for their tactics with original clothing unless it‚Äôs like.....naked Kate.....than maybe.....you know, for research
---
I'd wipe my ass with your cereal
---
Why wouldn't you? I hate when people get salty on this because the reason they are mad is they know if you walk away to check doors or look for others their chances of getting that survivor unhooked and everyone alive escaping goes up exponentially. They are mad that you aren't playing the game they want but your the killer, camping all game sucks but if I am about to get a 4k escape and all gens are gone you know I am not leaving that last guy and tough luck if your dumb enough to try be altruistic and I down you to hook next.
---
You have enough crutch perks as a survivor to tank an M1 killer for 12 seconds, just standing there as they hit you. Learn to loop scrub.
---
Eh, it'll decrease the frustration of dealing with him while making him stall out the game. The increase in TR makes it so he can see people further out now and (hopefully) the distance FF gets stays the same from before just with different stats. Legion shouldn't be played as a Tunneler anyways, just like Freddy shouldn't either. That's poor utilization of their powers to not use it on multiple people. Get at least two in deep wound so that they are injured and then actively chase the third. End power when you get next to them.
---
He's still better than Trapper, as Trapper becomes a literal M1 killer after 3 gens have popped. You can't keep gen pressure when you have to go across the map for traps, or you do that and there's either 1 gen or no gens left. Or you keep getting into chases aaandddd they're all gone.
---
I'd tank your house with my hummer. Go back to Canada
---
WHY AM I LOSING A PIP JUST BECAUSE THE GOD DAMN KILLER DC'D
---
&gt;if you really did play killer you would not need to outwardly state it, you would realize it has nothing to do with the content of your arguments simply that I said you take survivor side all the time.
---
You just called me a tunnel visioned survivor main:
---
&gt;unlike you who is just about the most tunnel visions survivor main I've ever seen post on the reddit lol.
---
and then when I say that I actually play killer more than survivor, you say that I shouldn't need to mention that. What?
---
&gt;You're lying and it's very clear. You show no understanding of what most people who actually play killer or both sides know.
---
So because I don't constantly cry for killer buffs and always side with anything killer related, I can't main killer? You know that people can have different opinions about things? If someone mains nurse that doesn't prevent them from realizing that she ignores most of the game's mechanics, if someone uses syringes it doesn't prevent them from noticing that they are overpowered. So me playing mainly killer doesn't prevent me from noticing that some things might be badly balanced/overtuned or undertuned.
---
&gt;Post history means nothing 
---
But that's literally the context over which you are deeming me a 
---
&gt; the most tunnel visions survivor main I've ever seen post on the reddit lol.
---
so it seems like it should matter a bit, no?
---
&gt;Your opinion is so biased
---
Please show me the bias. 
---
&gt;because its survivor favored
---
You actually think this subreddit is survivor sided? That's rich.
---
I agree with that. I don‚Äôt like killers that are addon dependent. I like when addons change play style.
---
It sucks to be camped but in this situation it's perfectly understandable, seeing as the Survivor can most likely easily escape if unhooked at that point.
---
Are you pissing yourself yet, Ms. Morel?
---
Legion can no longer spam attack in frenzy like he was originally advertised as being able to do. Legion now has to wait till his power is fully recharged to even use it. If legion misses a frenzy attack he‚Äôs knocked out of frenzy. If he actually does manage to land a hit the deep wound is now useless because if the survivors in Legions terror radius the timers paused and oh look at that the terror radius was increased and the timer pauses if the survivor mends so now Legions double fucked because if he chases the survivor deep wounds useless and if he doesn‚Äôt they‚Äôll mend instantly making deep wound useless. 
---
They literally made his power completely useless. Legion can pretty much just basic attack now.
---
‚ÄúHuge fuss‚Äù is this gamebase‚Äôs middle name.
---
That's just the problem. They gave Legion "counterplay" at the complete and utter expense of Lethality.
---
*‚ÄùI‚Äôm an Oxford man you are old sport.‚Äù*
---
I honestly didn‚Äôt consider this arguing but a normal conversation. If you‚Äôre referring to me responding sarcastically to comments that were purposely made to attack me or make me seem like a bad guy for throwing together a legion meme that I made at 5 am for a quick giggle with me and my group chat, I responded to them like that because I don‚Äôt care that they‚Äôre trying to make it seem like I‚Äôm the big bad ‚Äòbully‚Äô. I know the community is divided on this issue, originally in the post not once did I ever state my opinion on the nerf/rework. Personally, I could care less because I liked playing against fair legions and had fun with him as a killer.
---
People then started coming in, assuming my position, and either attacking or criticizing me. While I responded to other comments who didn‚Äôt tell me to go fuck myself for a meme on the internet maturely, I responded to comments with the intention of antagonizing me sarcastically because I couldn‚Äôt give less of a shit what they think of my meme of a character from a video in which people will forget in 24 hours when it‚Äôs replaced by ( probably ) another legion meme and my 15 minutes of fame on this subreddit will be over.
---
So basically, yeah I can take criticism. What I don‚Äôt take is people shitting on me for no reason for a meme on the internet. And no, we were never arguing. Thanks for taking the time to read my whole ass paragraph if you did, and I hope you have a great one if you choose not to reply.
---
Many changes have been made because of killers complaining. Remember vacuum pallets? Remember instablind flashlights? Remember double and triple pallet placements? Remember no bloodlust or a game with no nurse? Remember how unfair old DS was? Remember old BNP that now got nerfed into uselessness? It's not just survivors complaining, they're responding to their customers.
---
You see, nerf bullets don‚Äôt hurt
---
I'm sorry.....positives?
---
Where?
---
BBQ AND CHILI IS IN THE SHRINE WHILE I WORKED AND PAID FOR MY BBQ, AND ALSO EVERY KILLER CAN FIND ME WHEN I PLAY SURVIVOR NOW NO JOKE!
---
I HATE BEING FARMED LIKE THAT!
---
EVERY DAMN TIME
---
Using both blade addons causes each consecutive frenzy hit too increase the timer for mending.... It can literally reach up to seven minutes or so.
---
Why are we still here? Just to suffer? Every night, I can feel my leg... And my arm... even my fingers... The body I've lost... the comrades I've lost... won't stop hurting... It's like they're all still there. You feel it, too, don't you? I'm gonna make them give back our past!
---
Unce unce unce unce it think I lost the beat but unce unce unce unce
---
MY PC ISN'T TOP OF THE LINE BUT IT SHOULD RUN DBD LIKE BUTTER SO WHY DO I NEVER KNOW WHEN SKILL CHECKS ARE GOING TO STUTTER LIKE HELL AND MAKE ME MISS? THEN THEY SMOOTH OUT ONCE I'VE STARTED COMPENSATING FOR THE STUTTER, MAKING ME MISS AGAIN!
---
Literally people were screaming about deleting the whole character from the game. Big name youtubers talking about how legion itself is a factor making the game unfun and calling for either a total overhaul or deletion. People constantly bitching and bitching and bitching about legion and how uncounterable they are and other bullshit. Now an update comes out where they tried to work on the character a bit and people are screaming 'they went too far!!!! UwU my babies!!!' Jesus Christ
---
LMAO
---
Yeah me too
---
Don't ask me why
---
ARENT NURSES JUST PEACHY SOMETIMES WOW
---
Don't need to test trash to know that it's garbage. It's pretty obvious what it is just by seeing it near a dumpster.
---
Please can we take a moment to appreciate the "bitch" written above freds head?
---
Also - incredible art, you should draw more!

It was pretty clearly sarcasm..

Billy's new pants look great.
